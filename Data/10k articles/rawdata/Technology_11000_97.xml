'''2,4-Dinitrotoluene''' ('''DNT''') or '''dinitro''' is an [[organic compound]] with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This pale yellow [[crystalline]] solid is well known as a precursor to [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT) but is mainly produced as a precursor to [[toluene diisocyanate]].

==Isomers of dinitrotoluene==
Six [[positional isomer]]s are possible for dinitrotoluene. The most common one is 2,4-dinitrotoluene.  The [[nitration]] of [[toluene]] gives sequentially [[mononitrotoluene]], DNT, and finally TNT.  2,4-DNT is the principal product from dinitration, the other main product being about 30% 1,3-DN2-T.  The nitration of [[4-nitrotoluene]] gives 2,4-DNT.&lt;ref name=Booth&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gerald Booth|title=Nitro Compounds, Aromatic|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2007|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a17_411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Most DNT is used in the production of [[toluene diisocyanate]], which is used to produce flexible [[polyurethane]] foams.  DNT is [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] to produce [[2,4-Diaminotoluene|2,4-toluenediamine]], which in turn is [[phosgene|phosgenated]] to give [[toluene diisocyanate]].  In this way, about 1.4 billion kilograms are produced annually, as of the years 1999–2000.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{ Ullmann | author = Six, C. | author2 = Richter, F. | title = Isocyanates, Organic | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a14_611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other uses include the explosives industry. It is not used by itself as an explosive, but some of the production is converted to TNT.

Dinitrotoluene is frequently used as a [[plasticizer]], deterrent coating, and burn rate modifier in [[propellant]]s (e.g., [[smokeless gunpowder]]s). As it is [[carcinogen]]ic&lt;ref name=PGCH/&gt; and toxic, modern formulations tend to avoid its use. In this application it is often used together with [[dibutyl phthalate]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Toxicity==
Dinitrotoluenes are highly toxic with a [[threshold limit value]] (TLV) of 1.5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0235.html NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Dinitroluene]&lt;/ref&gt;  It converts [[hemoglobin]] into [[methemoglobin]].

2,4-Dinitrotoluene is also a listed hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261.30. Its [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) hazardous waste Number is D030. The maximum concentration that may be contained to not have toxic characteristics is 0.13&amp;nbsp;mg/L.

'''Agricen''' is a plant health [[biotechnology]] company headquartered in [[Frisco, Texas]], USA, that produces [[microorganism|microbially]] derived [[biochemistry|biochemical]] products for the [[agriculture]], [[sod|turf]] and [[ornamental plant]] markets.

==History==
Agricen was founded as Advanced Microbial Solutions (AMS) in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of Agricen|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=8669045|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, Agricen entered a strategic partnership with Loveland Products, Inc., a provider of crop input products and part of publicly traded company [[Agrium|Agrium Inc.]] As part of the agreement, Loveland Products acquired an ownership position in the company. The company’s name was changed to Agricen in early 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cho|first=Hanah|title=Frisco-Based Advanced Microbial Solutions Changes Name to Agricen|url=http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2013/02/frisco-based-advanced-microbial-solutions-changes-names-to-agricen.html/|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=Dallas Morning News|date=25 February 2013}} (blog)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, [[Agrium]], through Loveland Products, acquired a controlling interest in Agricen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Calgary's Agrium Buys Agricen|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/business/Calgary+Agrium+buys+Agricen/10149006/story.html|accessdate=7 September 2014|newspaper=Calgary Herald|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3217">{{Antennas|characteristics}}

In [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] theory, antenna efficiency is most often used to mean '''radiation efficiency'''. In the context of antennas, one often just speaks of "efficiency." It is a measure of the [[electrical efficiency]] with which a radio antenna converts the radio-frequency power accepted at its terminals into radiated power. Likewise, in a receiving antenna it describes the proportion of the radio wave's power intercepted by the antenna which is actually delivered as an electrical signal. It is not to be confused with [[Aperture efficiency (antennas)|aperture efficiency]] which applies to aperture antennas such as the [[parabolic reflector]].

==Definition==

Radiation efficiency is defined by [[IEEE]] Std 145-1993&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Std 145-1993, Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas, {{ISBN|1-55937-317-2}}, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IEEESTD.1993.119664 IEEEXplore]&lt;/ref&gt; "Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas" as "The ratio of the total power radiated by an antenna to the net power accepted by the antenna from the connected transmitter." It is sometimes expressed as a percentage (less than 100), and is frequency dependent.  It can also be described in [[decibels]]. 

For wire antennas which have a defined [[radiation resistance]] the radiation efficiency is the ratio of the radiation resistance to the total resistance of the antenna including ground loss (see below) and conductor resistance. &lt;ref&gt;Weelkes, W.J, (1968), ''Antenna Engineering'', McGraw Hill Book Company, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; In practical cases the resistive loss in any tuning and/or matching network is often included, although network loss is strictly not a property of the antenna.  

For other types of antenna the radiation efficiency is less easy to calculate and is usually determined by measurements.  

The [[antenna gain|gain]] of an antenna is the [[directivity]] multiplied by the radiation efficiency, as described in Std 145-1993.    

==Ground loss==

For [[monopole antenna|monopole]] and other ground-based antennas, ground loss occurs due to ohmic [[electrical resistance|resistance]] in the antenna's connection to its ground plane/counterpoise, including its mast or stalk and its bonding connections, as well as the ohmic resistance encountered by radio-frequency currents in the ground plane in the vicinity of the antenna.

==Aperture efficiency==
{{main|Aperture efficiency (antennas)}}
This is a distinct concept applied to aperture antennas such as a [[parabolic antenna]] and is a measure of the reduction in power gain caused by non-uniform aperture illumination by the feed antenna.  In a typical situation the reflector is illuminated with a reduced power-density at the edge compared with the centre, in order to reduce [[side lobe|sidelobes]] and other effects.  This causes a reduction in gain: the ratio of the gain of the tapered aperture distribution to the theoretical gain of a uniformly illuminated aperture is the aperture efficiency. &lt;ref&gt;Weelkes, W.J, (1968), ''Antenna Engineering'', McGraw Hill Book Company, pp. 256-258&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern bachelor grillers have controller knobs to control cooking temperatures. These are [[Steady state|steadystates]], a combination of a [[potentiometer]] and a [[thermostat]], which ensure that the temperature stays stable.

==History==

The expression is at least 100 years old, with early versions generally powered by gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=3578992|accessdate=5 March 2014|work=[[Christie's]]|title=A similar 'Bachelor' Griller, without stand, circa 1910|date=30 September 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Gas Logic|volume=21–26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jj48AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA7-PA14|pages=7–14|date=1917|accessdate=6 March 2014|title=Gas Logic, Volumes 21-26|publisher=[[New York Public Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression derives from the stereotypical idea that a [[bachelor]] will not cook anything properly, if at all. There has never been a [[brand name]] for these appliances called "Bachelor"; it has just become common parlance in the United Kingdom.

[[George Orwell]] used a bachelor griller in 1935, while sharing a flat with [[Rayner Heppenstall]] in [[Bloomsbury, London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0j2qODEJkdoC&amp;pg=PA150|page=150|volume=1.

The '''Bakers, Food and Allied Workers' Union''' ('''BFAWU''') is a [[trade union]] in the [[United Kingdom]].  Founded in 1847 in [[Manchester]], it represents workers in the [[food industry]].

==History==
Soon after foundation, the union began organising nationally and became the '''Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers'''.  It gained prominence when its 1861 campaign for improvements in working conditions led to the [[Bakehouse Regulations Act 1863]].  The union gradually adopted a federal structure.

In 1964, the union was renamed the '''Bakers' Union''', but this was later lengthened to the present name.

In July 2015, the BFAWU endorsed [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign, 2015|campaign]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|Labour Party leadership election]].&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite news |last=Syal|first=Rajeev|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/05/jeremy-corbyn-backing-unite-labour-leadership-race|title=Jeremy Corbyn gets backing of Unite in Labour leadership race|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=5 July 2015|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election results==
The union sponsored [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidates in several Parliamentary elections, winning twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parker |first1=James |title=Trade unions and the political culture of the Labour Party, 1931-1940 |date=2017 |publisher=University of Exeter |location=Exeter |page=125 |url=https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/32856/ParkerJ.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Labour Party (UK)|]], ''Report of the Twenty-second Annual Conference of the Labour Party'', pp.255-272&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''calender''' is a series of hard pressure rollers used to finish or smooth a sheet of material such as [[paper]], [[textile]]s, or plastics. Calender rolls are also used to form some types of [[plastic film]]s and to apply coatings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent

| url =https://patents.google.com/patent/US4425489A/en
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calenders are sometimes spelled ''calendars''.

==Etymology==
The word "calender" itself is a derivation of the word κύλινδρος ''kylindros'', the Greek word that is also the source of the word "cylinder".&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/calender|title=Definition of CALENDER|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In eighteenth century China, workers called "calenderers" in the silk and cotton cloth trades, used heavy rollers to press and finish cloth.

In 1836, Edwin M. Chaffee, of the Roxbury India Rubber Company, patented a four-roll calender to make rubber sheet.&lt;ref name=Polymers&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=James Lindsay|title=Principles of Polymer Engineering Rheology|date=July 20, 1990|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|page=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9X5C_0kpgIC&amp;lpg=PA49|accessdate=2014-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaffee worked with [[Charles Goodyear]] with the intention to "produce a sheet of rubber laminated to a fabric base".&lt;ref name=Plastics&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simpson|first1=W. G.|title=Plastics: Surface and Finish|date=December 31, 1995|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUipGAKOh3gC&amp;pg=PA52|accessdate=2014-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calenders were also used for paper and fabrics long before later applications for thermoplastics. With the expansion of the rubber industry the design of calenders grew as well, so when PVC was introduced the machinery was already capable of processing it into film.&lt;ref name="Plastics"/&gt; As recorded in an overview on the history of the development of calenders, "There was development in both Germany and the United States and probably the first successful calendering of PVC was in 1935 in Germany, where in the previous year the Hermann Berstorff Company of Hannover designed the first calender specifically to process this plastic".&lt;ref name="Plastics"/&gt;

In the past, for paper, sheets were worked on with a polished [[hammer]] or pressed between polished [[metal]] sheets in a press. With the continuously operating paper machine it became part of the process of rolling the paper (in this case also called web paper).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://glossary.ippaper.com/default.asp?req=glossary%2Fterm%2F2525&amp;catitemid=# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410031409/http://glossary.ippaper.com/default.asp?req=glossary%2Fterm%2F2525&amp;catitemid=# |archive-date=2009-04-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure between the rollers, the "nip pressure", can be reduced by heating the rolls or moistening the paper surface. This helps to keep the bulk and the stiffness of the web paper which is beneficial for its later use.

Modern calenders have "hard" heated rollers made from chilled [[cast iron]] or [[steel]], and "soft" rollers coated with [[polymeric]] composites. The soft roller is slightly non-cylindrical, tapered in diameter toward both ends, to widen the working nip and distribute the specific pressure on the paper more evenly.

==Calendering paper==
In a principal paper application, the calender is located  at the end of a [[papermaking]] process (on-line). Those that are used separately from the process (off-line) are also called ''supercalenders''. The purpose of a calender is to make the [[paper]] smooth and glossy for [[printing]] and [[writing]], as well as of a consistent thickness for [[capacitor]]s that use paper as their [[dielectric]] membrane.

The calender section of a [[paper machine]] consists of a calender and other equipment. The [[paper]] web is run between in order to further smooth it out, which also gives it a more uniform thickness. The pressure applied to the web by the rollers determines the finish of the paper, and there are three types of finish that the paper can have.

The first is [[Machine Finish]], or [[MF Paper]] and it can range from a ''Rough/ Matt'' (non glossy) look, to a Smooth high quality finish.

The second is called a [[Supercalendered Finish]], or [[MG Paper]] (Machine Glazed) which is Glossy/ Glazed, suitable for a high degree fine-screened [[halftone]] printing.

The third type of finish is called a ''plater'' finish, and whereas the first two types of finish are accomplished by the calender stack itself, a plater finish is obtained by placing cut sheets of paper between [[zinc]] or [[copper]] plates that are stacked together, then put under pressure and heating. A special finish such as a ''linen'' finish would be achieved by placing a piece of [[linen]] between the plate and the sheet of paper, or else an embossed steel roll might be used.

After calendering, the web has a moisture content of about 6% (depending on the furnish). It is wound onto a roll called a ''tambour'', and stored for final cutting and shipping.

===Supercalender===
A '''supercalender'''&lt;!-- Note: This is the correct spelling of "calender" when used in this sense. --&gt; is a stack of calenders consisting of alternating [[steel]] and [[fiber]]-covered rolls through which [[paper]] is passed to increase its [[density]], smoothness and gloss.  It is similar to a calender except that alternate chilled cast iron and softer rolls are used. The rolls used to supercalender uncoated paper usually consist of [[cast iron]] and highly compressed paper, while the rolls used for [[coated paper]] are usually cast iron and highly compressed cotton. The finish produced varies according to the raw material used to make the paper and the pressure exerted on it, and ranges from the highest English finish to a highly glazed surface. Supercalendered papers are sometimes used for books containing fine line blocks or [[halftone]]s because they print well from type and halftones, although for the latter they are not as good as coated paper.

==Calendering textiles==
{{main article|Calendering (textiles)}}

Calendering is a finishing process used on cloth and fabrics. A calender is employed, usually to smooth, coat, or thin a material.

With textiles, fabric is passed under rollers at high temperatures and pressures. Calendering is used on fabrics such as [[moire (fabric)|moire]] to produce its watered effect and also on [[cambric]] and some types of [[sateen]]s.

==Other materials==
Calenders can also be applied to materials other than paper when a smooth, flat surface is desirable, such as cotton, linens, silks, and various man-made fabrics and polymers such as [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] and [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] polymer sheets, and to a lesser extent [[HDPE]], [[polypropylene]] and [[polystyrene]].

The calender is also an important processing machine in the rubber industries, especially in the manufacture of tires, where it is used for the inner layer and fabric layer.

Calendering can also used for polishing, or making uniform, coatings applied to substrates- an older use was in polishing magnetic tapes, for which the contact roller rotates much faster than the web speed.  More recently, it is used in the production of certain types of secondary battery cells (such as spirally-wound or prismatic Lithium-ion cells) to achieve uniform thickness of electrode material coatings on current collector foils.

[[File:Benutzung eines Korrekturrollers.gif|thumb|Using a correction tape]]

'''Correction tape''' is an alternative to [[correction fluid]] used to correct mistakes during typing, or, in some forms, handwriting. One side of the tape, which is placed against the area to cover, is coated in a white, opaque masking material. Pressure applied to the other side of the tape transfers this material to the paper. Unlike correction fluid, the covered area can be written on it immediately after applying. As it is solid, correction tape is not subject to misuse as an [[inhalant]], unlike most correction fluids.

== Types ==
Correction tape is sold in short spools for hand use, or as long rolls to be used in [[typewriter]]s, which apply sudden pressure when a key is struck, and can therefore apply the masking material in exactly the same shape and position as the erroneous character. Some versions of correction tape are sold in separate dispensers that are used to roll the tape onto paper directly, sometimes known as a correction mouse.

The correction tapes can come in different variety of colours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fullmark.com/correction-tape-poly-bag-model-b |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124336/http://www.fullmark.com/correction-tape-poly-bag-model-b |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and designs in the current market. The materials of the tapes also varies, from having a paper-based tape that breaks easily to polyester film-based tapes that is more durable. The mechanism of the tapes differs too; the gear&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ebenjami.scripts.mit.edu/home/?page_id=310 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402103049/http://ebenjami.scripts.mit.edu/home/?page_id=310 |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the belt mechanism.

'''Dematic''' is a supplier of integrated automated [[supply chain]] technology, software and services. With a growth rate of 25% in 2016 Dematic is listed as the world's third-largest materials handling systems supplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mmh.com/article/top_20_systems_suppliers_2016|title=Top 20 systems suppliers, 2016|website=www.mmh.com|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company employs over 6,000 people and has engineering centres and manufacturing facilities in the [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Australia]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[China]]. Its customer base includes small, medium and large companies. 

Since November 2016 Dematic has been a member of [[KION Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.logisticsmgmt.com/article/kion_completes_its_acquisition_of_dematic|title=KION completes its acquisition of Dematic|website=www.logisticsmgmt.com|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dematic's headquarters are located in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]].

==History==
Dematic began in 1819 in [[Wetter (Ruhr)|Wetter]], Germany with the founding of {{ill|Mechanische Werkstätten Harkort &amp; Co.|de}}, which was incorporated 1910 by {{ill|Deutsche Maschinenbau-Aktiengesellschaft|de|Demag}} (Demag) and 1973 by [[Mannesmann AG|Mannesmann]]. After the acquisition of U.S. Rapistan (specialised in conveyor systems), Mannesmann DEMAG Fördertechnik AG was established. In 1993, Australian racking and shelving manufacturer Colby was added, and in 1997 the company was renamed to Mannesmann Dematic AG. Four years later, [[Siemens]] bought the company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-00-955_en.htm|title=Commission gives Siemens conditional go-ahead to take control of Mannesmann subsidiaries Dematic, VDO and Sachs.|last=|first=|date=29 August 2000|publisher=European Union|dead-url=|work=|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and merged it with its own logistics activities to form Siemens Dematic AG. In 2006 Siemens carved out the industrial and distribution logistics portion as Dematic GmbH &amp; Co. KG. In the same year, the investment firm Triton acquired the majority of shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.siemens.com/press/en/pr_cc/2006/06_jun/dem060616_1385408.htm|title=Triton takes over Dematic|last=|first=|date=June 14, 2006|website=|publisher=Siemens AG, Official Press Release|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, 2010, Dematic Group successfully completed the acquisition of HK Systems, a North American automated [[material handling]] and software provider. The expanded manufacturing footprint allows Dematic to manufacture within the USA [[Automated storage and retrieval system|storage and retrieval machines]] and [[Automated Guided Vehicle|automated guided vehicles]] in addition to [[conveyor]], sortation and [[order fulfillment]] technology.

On December 28, 2012, AEA Investors LP ("AEA") and Teachers' Private Capital ("TPC"), the private investment division of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, completed their acquisition of Dematic from private equity firm Triton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dgap.de/dgap/News/dgap_media/triton-sells-dematic-private-equity-investor-aea-investors-and-ontario-teachers-pension-plan/?newsID=739415|title=Triton sells Dematic to private equity investor AEA Investors and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan|last=|first=|date=November 2012|website=|publisher=DGAP-Media|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 Dematic acquired SDI Group Europe, a supplier of garment on hanger and flat sorter technology in Europe.

In November 2015, Dematic acquired Reddwerks Corp. pending approval of the shareholders. The acquisition became final in December 2015.

In March 2016 Dematic acquired NDC Automation, a leading provider of automated guided vehicles and software.

In June 2016, KION Group agreed to buy Dematic for about $2.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newequipment.com/Main/topstories/Kion-Gets-Warehouse-Robotics-With-21-Billion-Demat-1467.aspx|title=Kion Gets Warehouse Robotics With $2.1 Billion Dematic Deal|last=|first=|date=2016-06-21|website=|publisher=New Equipment Digest|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, KION Group completed the acquisition.

On March 13, 2017 Dematic announced the integration of Egemin Automation to create the world's leading provider of automated guided vehicle technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dematic.com/en/news-and-downloads/news-and-events/press-releases/2017/2017/03/10/18/45/2017-03-13-dematic-completes-egemin-integration/|title=Dematic completes Egemin Integration|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dematic.com|language=en|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diagonal scale''' is an [[engineering]] [[measuring instrument]] which is composed of a set of parallel straight lines which are [[Oblique angle|obliquely]] crossed by another set of straight lines. Diagonal scales are used to measure small fractions of the [[unit of measurement]].&lt;ref name="DictionaryWebster"&gt;{{cite book|title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language: The Dictionary Proper Being the Authentic Ed. ... of 1890, to which is Now Added a Department of New Words Together with Many Valuable Special Features|date=1913|publisher=Merriam-Webster|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=UullMQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Webster%27s+Revised+Unabridged+Dictionary&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY78qAyK3PAhXMLo8KHSELCPcQ6AEIHjAA|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Diagonal scale is derived from the Latin word ''Diagonalis''. The Latin word was originally coined from the Greek word ''diagōnios'' where ''dia'' means "through" and ''gonios'' denotes "corners".&lt;ref name="DictionaryWebster"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davidson|first1=Thomas|title=Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language|date=1907|publisher=W. &amp; R.

== Principle of Diagonal scale ==
Diagonal scale follows the [[Similar triangles|principle of similar triangles]] where a short length is divided into number of parts in which sides are proportional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Scales in Engineering Surveying  {{!}} Civil Engineering Projects|url=http://www.civilprojectsonline.com/surveying-and-levelling/types-of-scales-in-engineering-surveying/|accessdate=26 September 2016|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Divided into required number of equal parts

== Application ==
Diagonal scale is used in engineering to read lengths with higher accuarcy as it represents a unit into three different multiple in [[metres]], [[centimeters]] and [[millimeters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khan|first1=Md Zulfequar Ahmad|title=Text Book Of Practical Geography|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=9788170226826|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=mZKhRkZ7qawC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=diagonal+scale&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUw8SLzq3PAhXJuY8KHYYsCPIQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=diagonal%20scale&amp;f=false|language=en|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagonal scale is an important part in [[Engineering drawings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Punmia|first1=B.

The '''dimensional fact model''' ('''DFM''')&lt;ref name="GR09"/&gt; is an ad hoc and graphical formalism specifically devised to support the [[conceptual model]]ing phase in a DW project. DFM is extremely intuitive and can be used by analysts and non-technical users as well. A short-term working is sufficient to realize a clear and exhaustive representation of multidimensional concepts (e.g., attributes, measures and hierarchies). It can be used from the initial DW life-cycle steps, to rapidly devise a conceptual model to share with customers.

[[Data warehouses]] (DWs) are databases used by decision makers to ''analyze'' the status and the development of an organization. DWs are based on large amounts of data integrated from heterogeneous sources into [[multidimensional database]]s, and they are optimized for accessing data in a way that comes naturally to human analysts (e.g., [[OLAP]] applications).

Data in a DW are organized according to the multidimensional model, that hinges on the concepts of fact (a focus of interest for the decision-making process, such as sales and orders) and dimension (a coordinate for analyzing a fact, such as time, customer, and product). Each fact is quantified through a set of numerical measures, such as the quantity of product sold, the price of products, etc.

DW design and development require ad hoc methodologies and an appropriate life-cycle.&lt;ref name="GR09"&gt;Matteo Golfarelli and Stefano Rizzi.

Journal on Data Warehousing and Mining'' (IJDWM), volume 5, number 2. Idea Group 2009. Pages 1–23. {{ISSN|1548-3924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The DFM is a graphical conceptual model, specifically devised for multidimensional design, in order to:
* lend effective support to conceptual design
* create an environment in which user queries may be formulated intuitively
* make communication possible between designers and end users with the goal of formalizing requirement specifications
* build a stable platform for logical design
* provide clear and expressive design documentation.

The conceptual representation generated by the DFM consists of a set of fact schemata. Fact schemata model facts, measures, dimensions, and hierarchies (Figure 1). Besides these basic elements, the DFM includes a large set of constructs for expressing the multitude of conceptual nuances that characterize actual modeling scenarios in projects of small to large complexity. A multidimensional schema modeled with the DFM can easily (i.e., semi-automatically) be implemented on both [[ROLAP]] and [[MOLAP]] platforms.

== Basic concepts ==

A ''fact'' is a concept relevant to decision-making processes. It typically models a set of events taking place within a company. Examples of facts in the commercial domain are sales, shipments, purchases, and complaints.

[[Image:DFMSimpleFactSchema.png|frame|Figure 1: a simple fact schema for the invoice fact]]

A ''measure'' is a numerical property of a fact and describes a quantitative attribute that is relevant to analysis. For example, each sale is measured by the number of units sold, the unit price, and the total receipts.

A ''dimension'' is a property, with a finite domain, that describes an analysis coordinate of the fact. A fact generally has multiple dimensions that define its minimum representation granularity. Typical dimensions for the sales fact are products, stores, and dates; in which case, the basic information that can be represented is product sales in one store in one day.

A ''fact'' is represented by a box that displays the fact name along with the measure names. Small circles represent the dimensions, which are linked to the fact by straight lines (see Figure 1).

A ''dimensional attribute'' is a property, with a finite domain, of a dimension. Like dimensions, a dimensional attribute is represented by a circle. For instance, a product may be described by its type, category, and brand; a customer may be represented by city and nation. The relationships among the dimensional attributes are expressed by hierarchies.

A ''hierarchy'' is a directed tree whose nodes are dimensional attributes and whose arcs model many-to-one associations between dimensional attribute pairs. A hierarchy includes a dimension, positioned at the tree's root, and all of the dimensional attributes that describe it. Arcs are graphically represented by straight lines that connect dimensional attributes. Hierarchies define the way elemental business events can be selected and aggregated for decision-making processes.

== Advanced concepts ==

[[Image:DFMAdvancedFactSchema.png|frame|Figure 2: a more complex fact schema for the invoice fact]]

A ''descriptive attribute'' specifies a property of a dimension attribute, to which it is related by a x-to-one association. Descriptive attributes cannot be used for aggregation; they are always leaves of a hierarchy and are graphically represented by horizontal lines, like "telephone number" in Figure 2.

A ''cross-dimensional attribute'' is a dimensional or descriptive attribute whose value is defined by the combination of two or more dimensional attributes, possibly belonging to different hierarchies. For example, if a product value added tax (VAT) depends both on the product category and on the country where the product is sold, you can use a cross-dimensional attribute to represent it. Figure 2 shows this example by joining the arcs that define a product VAT with a circular arc.

[[Image:DFMMultipleArc.png|frame|Figure 3: a fact schema for the book sales fact]]

A ''convergence'' takes place when two dimensional attributes within a hierarchy are connected by two or more alternative paths of many-to-one associations. Convergences are represented by letting two or more arcs reach the same dimensional attribute. For instance, in Figure 2 the geographic hierarchy on the customer dimension contains a convergence if we assume that, though no inclusion relationships exists between districts and cities/states, sales districts never cross the nation boundaries. In this case, each customer belongs to exactly one nation whichever of the two paths is followed.

''Optional arcs'' are used to model scenarios for which an association represented in a fact schema is not defined for a subset of events. Optional arcs are marked with a dash. For instance, attribute ''diet'' in Figure 2 takes a value (such as cholesterol-free, gluten-free, or sugar-free) only for food products; for the other products, it is undefined.

A ''multiple arc'' models a many-to-many association between the two dimensional attributes it connects. Graphically, it is denoted by doubling the line that represents the arc. Consider the fact schema modeling the sales of books, represented in Figure 3, whose dimensions are date and book. It would certainly be interesting to aggregate and select sales on the basis of book authors. However, it would not be accurate to model author as a dimensional child attribute of book because a book may have more than one author, and authors can write more than one book. Hence, the relationship between books and authors is modeled as a multiple arc.

[[Image:ESA.png|right|ESA diagram.]]
The '''Enthusiast System Architecture''' (ESA) specification is a [[royalty-free]] protocol for two-way communication of PC components. Announced in 2007, ESA is used for monitoring temperature of computer hardware components such as the [[computer case]] and [[Computer power supply|power supply unit]]. The first and last official release of the ESA specification is version 1.0,&lt;ref&gt;Version 2.0 specifications was still in the works, but reserved in the USB-IF specification.&lt;/ref&gt; released in 2007. The ESA USB specification was created by a joint venture between [[Microsoft]], [[Nvidia]], [[Logitech]] and several other companies.&lt;ref&gt;USB HID modification submission version HUT1_12v2 to USB.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The protocol remains open and royalty-free; but, no manufacturers are currently utilizing its specification at this time.  The last known devices to utilize the ESA specifications were the [[Dell XPS 730x]] and [[Alienware]] Area-51 ALX computer systems that utilized the ESA specification to control its fans, LEDs, and motorized doors as well as the monitoring of available [[Water cooling]] systems such as the [[Dell XPS 730x]]'s [[H2Ceramic cooling|Dell H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ceramic Cooling System]].

The ESA specification is built around the current [[USB human interface device class]] specification and ESA was sent to the [[USB Implementers Forum]] HID subcommittee for discussion and approval in early 2007.  The USBIF approved and inserted the ESA specification into the USB HID specifications as an extension in late 2007 (''reference paper needed'').  All ESA-certified devices must pass [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] 2.0 logo compliance. Readings of temperature, voltage, current, power, activity level, water level, status, position and so on can be monitored via [[USB Implementers Forum]] specifications.  At the time of release, these devices could be controlled and monitored via the [[nTune]] application, while operating mode, voltages, rpm while also allowing these devices to be adjusted in the utility.

ESA devices have a [[microcontroller]] that integrates a USB 2.0-compliant full-speed device controller and ESA-compliant hardware components connects to the [[motherboard]] via a USB cable. ESA-compliant hardware components are seen as 'Collections'. Within the collections there are 'Zones'. Sensors and controls are organized into zones.

Only one software implementation exists; it is Nvidia's proprietary "System Tools with ESA Support" which only works on nForce-based motherboards and only runs on Windows.

| publisher=slipperybrick.com
| accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first EXOPC slate was launched in October 2010{{When|date=October 2010}} directly from EXOPC Corp. on their website, and in Canada through the company Hypertechnologie Ciara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciara-tech.com |title=Ciara Technologies |publisher=Ciara-tech.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hypertechnologie Ciara markets the slate under the name Ciara Vibe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exou.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=679 |title=EXOPC Community Forum • Index page |publisher=exou.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probitas markets the EXOPC as Mobi-One in [[Southern Europe]] and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.probitas.pt/detalheProduto.aspx?ido=18101 |title=MOBI ONE "Windows 8® Ready" - MOBILAND - Probitas &amp;#124; International Online Computer Store |publisher=Probitas.pt |date= |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RM plc|RM Education]] markets the EXOPC in the UK as the RM Slate. [[Leader Computers]] markets the EXOPC in  [[Australia]]. The EXOPC Slate is also currently{{When|date=April 2015}} available in the [[United States]] via the [[Microsoft Store]], both online and in stores. Mustek markets it as the Mecer Lucid Slate in [[South Africa]].

== Hardware ==
The architecture is based on an [[Intel Atom]]-M Pineview N450 [[CPU]] that is clocked at 1.66&amp;nbsp;GHz, and includes 2&amp;nbsp;GB of [[DDR2 SDRAM]] and 32&amp;nbsp;GB of [[solid-state drive]] (SSD) storage in its basic version, with an alternative model having a larger 64&amp;nbsp;GB SSD.

The EXOPC is also equipped with an [[accelerometer]], which lets the display change from a [[portrait mode]] to a [[landscape mode]] by turning the slate in either direction. Internally it has four [[mini-PCIe]] slots of which three provide space for full-length cards and one half length. Three of these slots are in use and the fourth is available, but intended for a [[Wireless Wide Area Network|WWAN]] card. The unit also provides a [[SIM card]] slot.

== Display ==
The EXOPC has an 11.6-inch diagonal, capacitive [[multi-touch]] screen. The screen has a resolution of 1366 × 768 [[pixels]] ([[Graphic display resolutions|WXGA]]), a [[16:9]] ratio, and has 135 [[pixels per inch]].
The screen's firmware currently allows detection of two points of simultaneous touch, but is technically capable of up to 10 points of touch.

A light sensor built into the front of the tablet automatically adjusts the display brightness to ambient condition.

It is also possible to use a [[Capacitive stylus#Styli|capacitive stylus]] for precision work, such as hand-drawn art and graphic works.

== Connectivity ==
The EXOPC offers connectivity equivalent to that of a standard laptop:
* [[Wi-Fi]] [[IEEE 802.11b]]/[[IEEE 802.11g]] / [[IEEE 802.11n]]
* [[Bluetooth 2.1]] + [[Bluetooth#Bluetooth v2.1 + EDR|EDR]]
* Two [[USB 2.0]] ports
* Audio in/out SuperJack
* Mini-[[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] for connecting to an external monitor or television, with a maximum output resolution of [[1080p]] (upscaled from 1366 × 768)
* Dock connector

== External power supply ==
Recharging the battery is done through a standard external power supply:&lt;ref&gt;[http://justslates.com/Products/EXOPC_Power_Supply_PSU.aspx Buy power supply PSU for EXOPC Ciara Vibe leader slate]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Size: {{convert|85|×|33|×|25|mm|in}}
* Weight: {{convert|950|g|oz|abbr=off}}
* Input: 100–240&amp;nbsp;V
* Output: 19&amp;nbsp;V, 2.1&amp;nbsp;amperes

== Software features ==

=== Operating system ===
The EXOPC uses [[Microsoft Windows 7]] as its operating system. The company has developed a [[GUI]] interface around the standard Windows 7 GUI, nicknamed by the EXOPC community as the ''Connect Four Interface'' due to its full screen of interactive circles arranged in a grid pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/05/30/EXOPC-slate-hands-on/
| title=EXOPC Slate hands-on
| date=2010-05-30
| publisher=[[Engadget]]
| accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dedicated button on the touch-screen interface will minimize the EXOPC layer and reveal the Windows 7 desktop, allowing the user to have the EXOPC Slate act as a standard Windows computer when needed.

{| Class = "center"
|
|}

=== Applications ===

==== Pre-installed applications ====
The EXOPC comes with the following pre-installed applications:
* [[Microsoft Security Essentials]]
* [[.NET Framework#.NET Framework 4|Microsoft .NET framework 4.0]]
* [[Microsoft Silverlight|Microsoft Silverlight runtime for IE]]
* [[Adobe Flash Player|Adobe Flash Player 10.2]] and [[Acrobat Reader]] for reading PDF files
* EXOPC GUI Layer

==== Store-specific applications ====
An application library, similar to the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] App Store or the [[Android Market]] is available for the device, accessible through the EXOPC UI.

== Feedback ==
The tablet captured the attention of several blogs and websites in the summer of 2010, being heralded as a possible alternative to the [[iPad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Florence Violet McKenzie''' [[OBE]] (''née'' '''Granville'''; 28 September 1890&lt;ref name="DoS" /&gt; or 1892&lt;ref name=Heywood/&gt; – 23 May 1982), affectionately known as "Mrs Mac", was Australia's first female [[electrical engineer]], founder of the [[Women's Emergency Signalling Corps]] (WESC) and lifelong promoter for technical education for women.&lt;ref name="DoS"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/mckenzie_violet |title = McKenzie, Violet | author = Catherine Freyne | year = 2010 |work = Dictionary of Sydney |publisher = Dictionary of Sydney Trust |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She campaigned successfully to have some of her female trainees accepted into the all-male Navy, thereby originating the [[Women's Royal Australian Naval Service]] (WRANS).&lt;ref name=Heywood/&gt; Some 12,000 servicemen passed through her signal instruction school in [[Sydney]], acquiring skill in [[Morse code]] and visual signalling ([[flag semaphore]] and [[International Code of Signals]]).&lt;ref name="Who's who"&gt;{{Citation | title=Who's Who in Australia | publication-date=1955 | publisher=Herald and Weekly Times Ltd | edition=15th ed. / compiled and edited by Joseph A. Alexander | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/5773767 | accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She set up her own electrical contracting business in 1918, and [[apprentice]]d herself to it, in order to meet the requirements of the Diploma in Electrical Engineering at [[Sydney Technical College]] and in 1922 she was the first Australian woman to take out an [[amateur radio operator]]'s license. Through the 1920s and 1930s, her "Wireless Shop" in Sydney's Royal Arcade was renowned amongst Sydney radio experimenters and hobbyists. She founded ''[[Wireless Weekly|The Wireless Weekly]]'' in 1922, established the [[Electrical Association for Women]] in 1934, and wrote the first "all-electric [[cookbook]]" in 1936. She also corresponded with [[Albert Einstein]] in the postwar years.&lt;ref name="HJS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/hindsight/stories/2009/2451146.htm |title=Hindsight – 18 January 2009 – Signals, currents, and wires: the untold story of Florence Violet McKenzie |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2009-01-18 |accessdate=18 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203054054/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/hindsight/stories/2009/2451146.htm |archivedate=3 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and education==
Florence Violet McKenzie was born Florence Violet Granville on 28 September 1890 in [[Melbourne]], although before her marriage to Cecil McKenzie at the age of 34, she was known as Violet Wallace.&lt;ref name="DoS" /&gt; Other sources cite 1892 as her birth year.&lt;ref name=Heywood&gt;{{cite web|last=Heywood|first=Anne|title=McKenzie, Florence Violet (1892–1982)|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE0386b.htm|work=The Australian Women's Register|publisher=The National Foundation for Australian Women|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace was her stepfather George's surname; he was a commercial traveller. When Violet was an infant, the family moved to [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]], south of [[Sydney]].
{{Quote box
|width= 30em |border= 1px |align= right |fontsize= 85% |salign= right |quote= "I went down to Technical College and saw the Head there, and he said, 'Oh, you can't come here and do engineering unless you're working at it'… I said, 'Well now, suppose I had an electrical engineering business and I'm working at it, would that be all right?' He said, 'Yes, if you produce proof.' So I went back and I had some cards printed with my name on, and electrical work, and got the paper and wrote down the ads, and read that a house in ... [[Undercliffe, New South Wales|Undercliffe]] about 2 miles from the tram&lt;ref name="The Mercury 1922, p. 14"/&gt; ... was asking for prices for putting in electric light and power… I went out there and nobody else was silly enough to go, so they gave me the job. … I went back to Tech and took my card down and showed them the contract for the job, and they said, 'All right, you can start.'"|source= Florence McKenzie&lt;ref name="Oralinterview" /&gt;
}}
From a young age, Violet had an independent interest in electricity and invention. As she recalled in an oral history interview in 1979:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I used to play about with bells and buzzers and things around the house. My mother would sometimes say "Oh, come and help me find something, it's so dark in this cupboard" – she didn't have very good eyesight… So I'd get a battery and I'd hook a switch, and when she opened that cupboard door a light would come on… I started sort of playing with those things.&lt;ref name="Oralinterview"&gt;{{cite book|title=Interview with Florence Violet McKenzie at Glenwood Nursing Home, Greenwich|author=Louise Lansley and Islay Wybenga of the [[Sydney Girls' High School|Sydney High Old Girls' Union]]|date=1979-09-08}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From [[Thirroul, New South Wales|Thirroul]] school, McKenzie won a bursary to study at [[Sydney Girls' High School]]. In 1915 she passed Chemistry I and Geology I at the [[University of Sydney]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=University of Sydney | title=Calendar of the University of Sydney for the year 1916| publication-date=1888–1942 | publisher=Gibbs, Shallard &amp;amp; Co | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/13098848 | accessdate=3 January 2012}}, pp. 429–30. Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; then approached the [[Sydney Technical College]] in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]] to enrol in the Diploma of Electrical Engineering. By March 1922, she had won the diploma.&lt;ref name="The Mercury 1922, p. 14"&gt;"Women and Wireless" in ''The Mercury'', 18 March 1922, p. 14 column 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1923, McKenzie graduated from the Sydney Technical College. She later gave her Diploma – the first of its kind awarded in Australia to a woman – to the collection of the [[Powerhouse Museum]], also in Ultimo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://from.ph/262414 |title=K50 Diploma, Electrical Engineering, awarded to Miss Florence Violet Wallace (married name Mrs F V McKenzie) on 31-12-1923|author=Powerhouse Museum |accessdate=13 November 2011|publisher=Powerhouse Museum, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Violet McKenzie and husband Cecil McKenzie.png|thumb|left|Violet McKenzie and husband Cecil McKenzie c1935]]
Cecil Roland McKenzie was a young electrical engineer employed by the Sydney County Council's Electricity Undertaking. He too was a radio enthusiast, and one of Violet's customers at the shop. They were married at the Church of St Philip in [[Auburn, New South Wales|Auburn]] on [[New Year's Eve]] 1924. They built a house at 26 George Street, [[Greenwich Point, New South Wales|Greenwich Point]] complete with a wireless room in the attic.&lt;ref name="Dale"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dale|first=Marie|title=The Radio Girl 'tunes in' to many interests|newspaper=[[The Australian Woman's Mirror]]|date=21 July 1925|page=20}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; The house remains, but has been extensively renovated since the McKenzies lived there.

The McKenzies had a daughter, stillborn, in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Morning Herald, 19 July 1926, p. 10 column 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  They sometimes took in the two sons of Violet's only sibling, Walter Reginald Wallace, from Melbourne. According to the [[Sands Directory]] these boys, Merton Reginald Wallace and Lindsay Gordon Wallace, later operated their own radio shop in [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]], Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Sands &amp;amp; McDougall's Melbourne, suburban and country directory | publication-date=1862 | publisher=Melbourne | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/36461848 | accessdate=3 January 2012}}. Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early employment and interests==
[[File:Crowd outside McKenzie's wireless shop.png|thumb|right|The Wireless Shop&lt;br&gt; Miss F.V. Wallace, electrical engineer]]
Violet taught mathematics at Armadale, before deciding to take a course in electrical engineering.&lt;ref name="The Mercury 1922, p. 14"/&gt; Throughout her studies, Miss Wallace worked as an electrical contractor, installing electricity in private houses, such as that of politician [[Archdale Parkhill]] in [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]], and in factories and commercial premises, including the Standard Steam Laundry on Dowling Street, [[Woolloomooloo, New South Wales|Woolloomooloo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Self made success |author= |url= |newspaper= Sunday Guardian|date= 20 October 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was an enthusiastic [[ham radio]] operator, being the first licensed woman in the country and with the call sign "2GA" (later changed to "VK2FV").&lt;ref name="Ozatwar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunn|first=Peter|title=Women's Emergency Signalling CORPS IN AUSTRALIA DURING WWII|url=http://www.ozatwar.com/sigint/wesc.htm|publisher=Ozatwar.com|accessdate=21 November 2011|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 Miss Wallace opened "The Wireless Shop", after purchasing the entire stock of the wireless vendor who preceded her&lt;ref name="The Mercury 1922, p. 14"/&gt; – billing itself as "the oldest radio shop in town"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Advertisement for The Wireless Shop|newspaper=The Wireless Weekly|date=24 November 1933|page=20}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; – in the [[Royal Arcade, Sydney|Royal Arcade]] (which ran from George Street through to Pitt Street – replaced in the 1970s by the [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] hotel).&lt;ref&gt;Ric Havyatt quoted in {{cite news|last=Begbie|first=Richard|title=The Marvellous Mrs Mac, alias FV Wallace – Part 1|newspaper=Radio Waves|date=October 2008|page=7}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; McKenzie later said it was schoolboys visiting her shop who first introduced her to Morse code.&lt;ref name="Oralinterview" /&gt; Australia's first weekly radio magazine was conceived at the shop, by Miss Wallace and three co-founders. "The Wireless Weekly" became the monthly magazine "Radio &amp; Hobbies", then "Radio, Television &amp; Hobbies", and finally [[Electronics Australia]],&lt;ref name="Ozatwar" /&gt; and remained in circulation until 2001.&lt;ref name="DoS" /&gt;

[[File:Violet McKenzie with wireless.png|thumb|left|McKenzie working with the wireless radio c1922]]
In 1924 McKenzie became the only female member of the [[Wireless Institute of Australia]].&lt;ref name="Radi"&gt;{{cite book |title= 200 Australian Women: A Redress Anthology|last= Broomham|first= Rosemary| editor= Heather Radi|year= 1988|publisher= Women's Redress Press|location= Broadway NSW|isbn= 0-9589603-7-2|page= 179}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year she travelled to the United States for business reasons, and in San Francisco was welcomed at radio 6KGO: 'Miss Wallace, an electrical engineer from Australia, will now talk from the studio.' She reportedly used her time on air to comment on the difference between the tram systems in San Francisco and those in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss Wallace speaks from 6 KGO|newspaper=The Australasian Wireless Review|date=December 1924|page=37}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 she also notes that she experimented with improving the science of television through the use of [[chemistry]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[I] have a pronounced kink for television work and devote most of my spare time in experimenting that branch of the science. Have a deep-rooted conviction that chemistry is going to provide the solution and am working along those lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=F.V. McKenzie|newspaper=The Wireless Weekly|date=3 April 1931}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The McKenzies had a mutual interest in [[tropical fish]] and had an enormous fish pond in the front yard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Ex-WRANS Ditty Box|date=June 1982|page=6}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; She spoke of heating water electrically to house tropical fish at home in the early 1920s, and of having given talks on radio 2FC about tropical fish in the days when she was doing electrical contracting work.&lt;ref name="Oralinterview" /&gt; In January 1933 the American journal [[Aquariana]] published an article written by McKenzie concerning 'Some interesting inhabitants of Sydney seashores', in which she recommended keeping sea horses in a salt-water tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKenzie|first=Mrs F. Violet|title=Some interesting inhabitants of Sydney seashores|journal=Aquariana|date=January 1933|volume=1|issue=7|pages=160–1}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's technical education==
[[File:The Electrical Association for Women.png|thumb|The rooms of the Electrical Association for Women, c1936. McKenzie sitting at the piano]]
In the 1930s, McKenzie turned her attention increasingly to teaching other women about electricity and radio. She had observed the need over years of working in the field herself. In 1925, she told the ''[[Australian Woman's Mirror]]'': "[T]here are such a lot of women experimenters [amongst my customers] that I would like to form a Women's Wireless Club."&lt;ref name="Dale" /&gt; In 1931 she told a [[Sunday Sun]] reporter that she wanted to see a course of lectures on domestic radio and electricity established in girls' schools and technical colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Careers for girls – Radio offers wide field|newspaper=Sunday Sun|date=1 February 1931}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year she took matters into her own hands, opening a Women's Radio College on Phillip Street in 1932. She persuaded employers to take on some of her trainees, as one of them later recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the Depression I joined Mrs Mac's electrical school in Phillip Street. It was the first time girls were involved with electrical circuits, Morse and making radio sets. Later Mrs Mac decided it was time to use our skills in industry, so she persuaded Airzone Ltd to take one of us (me) on trial in their radio section. Soon the others followed from the school, and we started the component parts section, and we were absorbed into many other sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Other memories of Mrs Mac|newspaper=Ex-WRANS Ditty Box|date=June 1982|pages=9}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McKenzie believed that electricity could save women from domestic drudgery, writing that... "To see every woman emancipated from the "heavy" work of the household by the aid of electricity is in itself a worthy object."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McKenzie|first=Florence Violet|title=What have the ladies to say?|newspaper=[[The Contactor]]|date=8 November 1935|page=7}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; To this end in 1934 she founded an educational initiative, the [[Electrical Association for Women]] (EAW) at 170 [[King Street, Sydney|King Street]] in the centre of Sydney, later moving a few blocks away to 9 [[Clarence Street, Sydney|Clarence Street]].

Concerned with safety when using electrical appliances, and no doubt drawing on her own experience in receiving an accidental electric shock that knocked her out for an hour, McKenzie delivered at least one talk on resuscitation, advising that conventional resuscitation should proceed for up to thee-quarters of an hour following electrocution. She knew of one case where recovery took 4 hours.&lt;ref&gt;''Cairns Post'', 25 January 1935, p. 14 column 5; ''Australian Women's Weekly'', 24 June 1933, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1936, McKenzie had sold the Wireless Shop, and was busy at the Electrical Association for Women. She gave electric cooking demonstrations in the EAW kitchen, which was fitted out with show electrical appliances by the Sydney County Council.&lt;ref name="Oralinterview" /&gt; She compiled the EAW Cookery Book, Australia's first "all-electric" cookery book, which ran into seven editions and remained in print until 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=McKenzie, F. V. (Florence Violet) | author2=Association for Electrical Development | title=The all electric cookery book | publication-date=1954 | publisher=Associated General Publications | edition=7th | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/6398597 | accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote an illustrated book for children about electrical safety called ''The Electric Imps'' in 1938.&lt;ref name="Who's who" /&gt;

In July 1938, McKenzie was one of 80 women in attendance at the inaugural meeting of the Australian Women's Flying Corps (later known as the [[Australian Women's Flying Club]]) held at the Feminist Club of New South Wales at 77 King Street. McKenzie was appointed treasurer and instructor in Morse code to the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Thomson, Joyce A.

==Women's Emergency Signalling Corps==

In 1939 McKenzie established the [[Women's Emergency Signalling Corps]] (WESC) in her Clarence Street rooms – known affectionately as "Sigs". Her original idea was to train women in telegraphy so that they could replace men working in civilian communications, thereby freeing those skilled men up to serve in the war.&lt;ref name="Ditty"&gt;{{cite news|last=McKenzie|first=Florence Violet|title=The Women's Emergency Signalling Corps|newspaper=Ex-WRANS Ditty Box|date=June 1976}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time war broke out, 120 women had been trained to instructional standard.&lt;ref name="Ellison"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ellison|first=Norman|title=Magnificent Mrs Mac!|newspaper=Sky Script|page=14|date=April 1948}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's Royal Australian Naval Service==
[[File:Women’s Emergency Signalling Corps members at Castle Hill c1939.png|thumb|Dressed in the practical green uniforms designed by McKenzie, Corps members spell out W E S C in [[flag semaphore]].]]
McKenzie campaigned energetically to have some of her female trainees accepted into the Air Force and Navy as [[telegraphist]]s. She encountered a great deal of official resistance. In 1940 she wrote to the Minister of the Navy, former Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes|WM (Billy) Hughes]], saying "I would like to offer the services of our Signalling Corps, if not acceptable as telegraphists then at least as instructors."&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{Citation | author=Nelson, Annette | author2=HMAS Harman (A.C.T.) | title=A history of HMAS Harman and its people : 1943–1993 | page=26| publication-date=1993 | publisher=DC-C Publications | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10668727 | accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her suggestion being dismissed, some time later McKenzie and six trainees were provided third-class train tickets to Melbourne to meet with the Naval Board for testing.&lt;ref name="Ozatwar" /&gt;

In early January 1941, Commander Newman, the Navy's Director of Signals and Communications, visited the WESC headquarters on Clarence Street to test McKenzie's trainees. Finding they were highly proficient, he recommended the Navy admit them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ships Belles: The Story of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service 1941–1985|last=Fenton Huie|first=Shirley|publisher=The Watermark Press|year= 2000|isbn= 0-949284-47-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes still took some convincing. After McKenzie threatened to take her offer to the Air Force instead, the urgent need for trained telegraphists prevailed, and on 21 April a Navy Office letter authorised the entry of women into the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1941–1962: WRANS comes of age|newspaper=Royal Australian Navy News|date=24 April 1962|page=1}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service – the WRANS. The minister's condition was that "no publicity...be accorded this break with tradition".&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;

On 28 April 1941, McKenzie accompanied 14 of her WESC trainees (twelve telegraphists and two domestic helpers). They had their medical test on 25 April and arrived at {{HMAS|Harman}} in [[Canberra]] on 28 April 1941. The women were dressed in their green WESC uniform which had been designed by McKenzie herself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newton|first=Gloria|title=Ex-WRANS plan get-together for 30th anniversary|newspaper=Women's Weekly|date=10 March 1971|page=15}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; – it was several months before a female Navy uniform was ready.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; Francis Proven became WRANS number 1. From this initial intake of 14, the WRANS ranks expanded to some 2,600 by the end of the war, representing about 10 per cent of the entire Royal Australian Naval force at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Curtis-Otter, W.R.A.N.S.: The Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, The Naval Historical Society of Australia, Garden Island NSW, 1975, p 5. Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; All told, McKenzie trained about 3,000 women, one-third of whom went into the services.&lt;ref name="Radi" /&gt; Many others remained at the Clarence Street school as instructors.

In May 1941, the Air Force appointed McKenzie as an honorary flight officer of the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Thomson, Joyce A. (Joyce Aubrey) | title=The WAAAF in wartime Australia | publication-date=1991 | page=339 | publisher=Melbourne University Press ; Portland, Or. : International Specialized Book Services | isbn=978-0-522-84435-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so she could legitimately instruct Air Force personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To 20,000 men and women she's 'Dear mother – Mrs Mac'|newspaper=Australian Home Journal|date=July 1963|page=45}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only official recognition McKenzie received during the war for her efforts.

==Postwar wireless training==
Violet McKenzie helped with rehabilitation after the war, keeping her school open for as long as there was a need for instruction in wireless signalling. In the postwar years, she trained men from the merchant navy, pilots in commercial aviation, and others needing the trade qualification known as a "signaller's ticket". In 1948, a reporter from ''Sky Script'' visit to the school and described the scene, and the diversity of students:

[[File:Violet McKenzie with overseas naval personnel.png|thumb|right|Mrs McKenzie with overseas naval personnel, c1953]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;At a table in a corner recently there were six elementary trainees: One was a Chinese quartermaster, another a half-Burmese. Two were Americans … One … an aircraft skipper down from New Guinea to get his wireless ticket; and the other chap a ship's officer with the same objective. In another corner there's an ANA commander preparing for his 20-word-a-minute exam: an English ship's wireless officer...an ex-RAF Wing-Commander...an Indian Navy man... [and] groups of airline 'types' also on the job.&lt;ref name="Ellison" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McKenzie told a journalist that, after the war, "All the airmen came back and wanted to join Qantas, but they needed to build up their Morse speed and learn to use the modern equipment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs Mac is truly special|newspaper=Reveille|date=April 1979|page=13}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of [[Civil Aviation]] fitted out a room at the school with transmitters, receivers and [[radio compass]] so that pilots could train for their wireless ticket at the school. From 1948, McKenzie held a First Class Flight Radio Telephony Operator License.

One of the ex-RAAF airmen who retrained for a civilian career with McKenzie wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Being unemployed, we spent almost all of each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She required no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true to say that a great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from AR Gray to ex-WRAN Jess Prain, 31 July 1987, held in the archives of the Ex-WRANS Association at the archives of the Ex-WRANS Association at the Naval Heritage Centre, [[Spectacle Island (Port Jackson)|Spectacle Island]]. Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Famous aviators who trained for their wireless ticket at McKenzie's school include [[Patrick Gordon Taylor]] and [[Cecil Arthur Butler]]. McKenzie also trained [[Mervyn Wood]], later Commissioner of Police in New South Wales, and the principals of the Navigation Schools at both the Melbourne and Sydney Technical Colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Resume of FV McKenzie's achievements prepared by the Ex-WRANS Association and held in the archives of the Ex-WRANS Association at the Naval Heritage Centre, [[Spectacle Island (Port Jackson)|Spectacle Island]]. Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a People magazine profile of McKenzie written in January 1953, McKenzie received an unceremonious notice from the owners of 10 Clarence Street to quit the premises. The [[Sands Directory]] indicates that she moved her operation briefly to No 6 Wharf at Circular Quay in 1953, before retiring to her home at Greenwich Point in 1954. McKenzie wrote that she closed the school when the airlines established their own school and the government added a signals training section to the Navigation School at the Technical College. She continued to help the occasional pupil with special difficulties at her home.&lt;ref name="Ditty" /&gt;

==Later life==

===Correspondence with Einstein===
In early 1949 McKenzie started writing to [[Albert Einstein]]. Her first letter to him wished him a speedy recovery from recent illness.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from FV McKenzie to Albert Einstein, 7 February 1949, held in the Albert Einstein Archives, [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of her letters are held in the Einstein archives in Jerusalem. It is clear from the second letter that he wrote back to her at least once. Some accounts claim that McKenzie corresponded regularly with Einstein for as long as 15 years before his death in 1955,&lt;ref name="Dot"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Dot with a Dash|newspaper=[[People (Australian magazine)|People]]|date=28 January 1953|page=23}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; but the documentary record suggests such reports exaggerate the extent of the correspondence. She also sent him several gifts over the years including shells (for his daughter) that airmen would collect across the Pacific on her request&lt;ref name="Oralinterview" /&gt; and a boomerang which had been brought to her from Central Australia by an airline pilot. She wrote that, "Some of your mathematical friends might like to plot its flight!"&lt;ref&gt;Letter from FV McKenzie to Albert Einstein, 28 February 1949, held in the Albert Einstein Archives, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt; There are other reports that she sent him a [[didgeridoo]], and a recording of didgeridoo music when he replied that he couldn't work out how to play the instrument.&lt;ref name="Dot" /&gt;

===Awards and honours===
On 8 June 1950, McKenzie was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) for her work with the WESC.&lt;ref name=Heywood/&gt; In 1957 she was elected a Fellow of the [[Australian Institute of Navigation]]. In 1964 she became Patron of the Ex-WRANS Association. In 1979 she was made a Member of the [[Royal Naval Amateur Radio Society]].&lt;ref name="DoS" /&gt; In 1980 a plaque celebrating her "skills, character and generosity" was unveiled at the Missions to Seamen Mariners' Church, [[Flying Angel House]]. The Church has since relocated to 320 Sussex St, where the plaque can be seen in the garden.&lt;ref name="DoS" /&gt;

===Final years===
Violet McKenzie was nine years older than her husband Cecil, but she outlived him by 23 years. After his death in 1958, she shared her house for a time with Cecil's sister Jean, a primary school teacher. In May 1977, after a stroke paralysed her right side and confined her to a wheelchair, McKenzie moved to the nearby Glenwood Nursing Home. She died peacefully in her sleep on 23 May 1982. At her funeral service, held at the Church of St Giles in Greenwich, 24 serving WRANS formed a Guard of Honour. McKenzie was cremated at the [[Northern Suburbs Crematorium]]. The June 1982 edition of the newsletter of the Ex-WRANS Association was devoted to their former teacher and patron. Amongst the memories recorded therein is a statement McKenzie made two days before she died: "...it is finished, and I have proved to them all that women can be as good as, or better than men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Other memories of Mrs Mac|newspaper=Ex-WRANS Ditty Box|date=June 1982|pages=11}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederic Emery Davis''' (born June 17, 1955), known as '''Fred Davis''', is a veteran US technology writer and publisher who served as editor of ''A+'' magazine, ''MacUser'', ''PC Magazine'', and ''PC Week''; personal computer pioneer; technologist; and entrepreneur involved in the startups of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', [[CNET]], [[Ask Jeeves]], Lumeria, Jaduka, and Grabbit.

==Childhood==
Davis was born at the [[Yale New Haven Hospital]] while his father was enrolled at Yale. Davis's father was Dr. Donald Davis (deceased), an [[IBM Fellow]] and the creator of the "[[learning organization]]" management practice (while a professor at the [[University of Utrecht]] in the Netherlands). Davis's mother was Doris Davis (deceased), an educator, artist, and longtime director of the [[Upward Bound]] project at [[Bowdoin College]], in Brunswick, Maine.

==Education==
Davis attended [[Friends Academy]], in Locust Valley, New York, from kindergarten through sixth grade, while his mother was an English teacher and assistant principal. In 1966 Davis enrolled at Eaglebrook School, in Deerfield, Massachusetts, where he spent grades 7 through 9 and graduated in 1970. In 1966 Davis, then age 11, learned computer programming, by participating in the testing and development of the BASIC computer language via a time-sharing hookup to Dartmouth College, where BASIC was being developed. In 1970 Davis enrolled at [[Northfield Mt. Hermon School]], in Northfield, Massachusetts, where he spent his sophomore and junior years. He spent his senior year of high school at Collins Brook School, in Freeport, Maine. The school was modeled after and run by former educators of the progressive [[Summerhill School]] in Suffolk, England. Davis graduated in 1973 from Collins Brook, where his senior class consisted of only six people. In 1978 Davis enrolled in [[Antioch College]] and completed his B.A. in Botany. The ''Wall St. Journal'' described Davis as "a teen-age prodigy who earned a B.A. in only one year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grimes|first=Ann|title=Regular Gatherings for Food, Issues Offer Face Time in the Real World|newspaper=Wall St. Journal|date=November 12, 1998|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 Davis continued at [[Antioch College]], and he earned his M.S. in Ecosystems Management in 1981. In 1980 Davis enrolled at [[Union Institute &amp; University]] as a degree candidate for a PhD in Information Technology. His dissertation was titled "Computer Assisted Publishing," and although Davis did not complete his PhD, the dissertation formed the groundwork for a book he coauthored—''Desktop Publishing''—one of the first books to be published on that topic.

== Early business ventures ==
In 1974 Davis bought Lougee's, a greenhouse and florist business in Belfast, Maine. He expanded the business to include North Star Orchids, an orchid nursery that was a major importer of orchids in 1975 and 1976. During that time, he designed and established a commercial plant tissue culture laboratory for North Star Orchids; the lab was one of the first commercial plant tissue culture labs to use a laminar flow hood based on millipore filters for aseptic lab work, at a time when glove boxes were the standard aseptic tissue culture work areas. Davis invented a new type of plant tissue culture vessel based on millipore filters for respiration, and that invention was published in ''[[Orchid Review]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Frederic E.|title=A New Method for the Aseptic Respiration of Plant Tissue Culture Vessles|journal=Orchid Review|date=August 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it received international attention. It was cited in subsequent scientific papers and eventually became part of the standard design of almost all types of labware that needed to provide aseptic respiration.

==History with computers==
In the late '70s, Davis moved from Maine to San Francisco, where he became one of the early personal computer pioneers working with CPM-based systems. Davis bought an original Apple II in 1977 and emerged as an early Apple II programmer, due to his prior knowledge of BASIC, the language that computer used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You Say You Want a (PC) Revolution|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=98344&amp;page=1#.T-TrFJiwWFE|work=ABC News – Tech|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis was among the first computer engineers to successfully connect microcomputers to mainframes, connecting his Apple II with Stanford's DEC PDP-10 while conducting research on database publishing at Stanford. Davis also served as a computer consultant to large corporations and venture capitalists in the early days of the industry.

==Magazine publishing==
Davis held several executive positions at technology magazines from 1983 to 2002. Davis was the editor of ''A+'', ''MacUser'', ''PC Magazine'', and ''PC Week''; a columnist and writer for ''Wired''; and the publisher of ''dig_iT''.

===ZD, ''A+'', ''MacUser''===
In 1983 Davis became one of the founders of Ziff-Davis's computer publishing division and worked on the startup of ZD's first computer publication, ''A+'', which rapidly became the leading publication about Apple computers. Later, during Fred's tenure as editor-in-chief, ''A+'' won the Computer Press Association award for Best Computer Magazine. From ''A+'', Davis moved over to serve as editor-in-chief of its sister magazine ''[[MacUser (US edition)|MacUser]]'', where he founded MacUser Labs. He oversaw the development of the magazine during its period of greatest growth, bringing it up to parity with ''Macworld''.

===''PC Magazine'', ''PC Week''===
Next, Davis joined ''[[PC Magazine]]'', which, at the time, was the world's leading computer publication in terms of revenue and circulation, with an annual revenue of approximately $250 million. As editor of ''PC Magazine'' and director of PC Magazine Labs, he helped develop benchmarks and scripts for testing thousands of products under review. Later, as editor of ''[[PC Week]]'', he founded PC Week Labs and developed industry-standard benchmark tests for corporate computing. After leaving ''PC Week,'' which was located in Massachusetts, to return to California, Davis helped launch and served as a columnist for several other Ziff-Davis publications, including ''Windows Sources'', ''Computer Life'', ''Family PC'', and the ZD Personal Computing newspaper supplement.

===''Wired''===
In 1992 Davis worked with ''Wired'' CEO Louis Rosetto on the launch of [[Wired magazine|''Wired'' magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald|first=Ted|title=Wired 1.1.1 – The Premiere Issue Revisited|url=https://www.wired.com/about/2012/05/wired-reimagines-its-first-issue-on-the-ipad|work=Wired Magazine|publisher=Conde-Naste}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of the original "''Wired'' Brain Trust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soboroff|first=Jacob|title=SXSW 2009|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/sundaysoapbox/2009/03/sxsw_2009_1.html|work=Sunday Soapbox|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Wired'', Davis worked with [[CNET]] CEO Halsey Minor as an original member of the CNET startup team, where he helped develop both television and online strategies.

===''dig_iT''===
In 2001 Davis and computer publishing pioneer [[David Bunnell]] founded Prosumer Media, the publisher of ''dig_iT'', a magazine focused on "the digital lifestyle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Steve|title=Dig-It Magazine Launches|url=http://www.adrants.com/2002/12/digit-magazine-launches.php|work=Adrants|publisher=Adrants Publishing LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Joiner|first=Whitney|title=Will The Tech Market Dig It?|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3065/is_2002_Oct_1/ai_92513216/|newspaper=Folio Magazine|date=October 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Online Media Daily|title=DigIt Will Launch in December|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/7333/digit-will-launch-in-december.html?print|newspaper=MediaPost|date=October 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corner Bar PR|title=Dig_iT Magazine: High-Tech Stuff for Ordinary Folks|url=http://www.cornerbarpr.com/articles/munchies.cfm?article=119|work=PR News Munchies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==
Davis was an early Internet pioneer who launched one of the Internet's first curated search and discovery sites, Weblust.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weblust.com |title=website (1996 version) |url=http://weblust.com/ |publisher=Internet Archive – Wayback Machine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961223045244/http://weblust.com/ |archivedate=December 23, 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early users of Weblust included [[Ralph Nader]] and [[Avram Miller]].

===NetGuide===
Working with CMP Media, Davis led a team that developed an advanced consumer portal and Internet search site named NetGuide. It included multimedia features and games such as "Where's Barlowe?" based on the travelings of [[John Perry Barlow]]. These features were developed by [[Marc Canter]], founder of MacroMind/MacroMedia, and David Biedney, a highly acclaimed graphic artist. NetGuide was one of the first major consumer Web projects to use [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. One of the programmers on the NetGuide project was [[Craig Newmark]], who later went on to start [[Craigslist]].

===CNET===
In 1994 Davis joined CNET during its early startup stage. He was the first computer industry person to join the CNET team, which at the time consisted of [[Halsey Minor]], Shelby Bonnie, and their administrative assistant. Davis worked with Fox Network cofounder Kevin Wendle and former Disney creative associate Dan Baker to produce CNET's four pilot television programs about computers, technology, and the Internet.

===Ask Jeeves===
In 1996 Davis helped launch Ask Jeeves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Security and Exchange Commission|title=Ask Jeeves Inc Form S-1/A|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=909251|work=IPO Filings|publisher=Security and Exchange Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now Ask.com), after venture capitalist [[Garrett Gruener]] introduced Davis to [[David Warthen]], the founding CEO.

===Lumeria===
In 1998 Davis was the CEO and founder of Lumeria, an infomediary company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leickly|first=Bethany L.|title=Infomediaries in e-Commerce: Case Studies|url=http://extrafancy.net/bethany/chapter5.php|work=Infomediaries in Information Economies|publisher=Georgetown University}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved in identity management; identity commerce;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Labalme|first=Fen|title=Broadcatch Technologies at Lumeria|url=http://www.broadcatch.com/lumeria/paper1/icommerce7.shtml|work=Broadcatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vallone|first=Julie|title=There's Money To Be Made From Your Data|url=http://www.jvallone.com/infomediaries.html|work=Investor's Business Daily: Computers Made Plain}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[consumer privacy]]; and helping consumers own, control, and get value from their personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glave|first=James|title=The Dawn of the Infomediary|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/1999/02/18094|work=Wired|publisher=Conde-Naste}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lumeria's identity management business was designed to provide a secure way for individuals to protect and share their personal information, with Lumeria acting as an agent on their behalf to protect their information and extract value from that information, which was stored in Lumeria's SuperProfile distributed secure XML database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lester|first=Toby|title=The Reinvention of Privacy|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/03/the-reinvention-of-privacy/2140/|newspaper=The Atlantic Magazine|date=March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lumeria had a controversial subsidiary, Lumeria Ad Network, that replaced ads in a user's browser with ads from that person's own ad network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrissey|first=Brian|title=Lumeria Ad Network Lets Users Control Web Ads|url=http://www.clickz.com/clickz/news/1706706/lumeria-ad-network-lets-users-control-web-ads|work=ClikZ|publisher=Incisive Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PrivaTel, Jaduka===
In 2005 Davis founded and served as the CEO of PrivaTel, a wholly owned subsidiary of Network Enhanced Telecom, LLP (also known as Network IP), based in Dallas, Texas. While at PrivaTel, Davis developed three main services: My Private Line, a prepaid calling card with disposable phone numbers that could be used for privacy protection when people are not comfortable providing their actual phone number and providing the ability to turn individual numbers off or direct them to go directly to voicemail; Click-and-Connect, a service that enables someone to initiate a phone call from almost every Web page or application; and CallsAd, a service in which classified ads are sold with a temporary contact number, enabling the seller to keep personal numbers private and turn the contact number off after the sale. After Davis's departure, the company was renamed Jaduka and it dropped the privacy products to focus exclusively on the Click-and-Connect service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jaduka|title=Web Site|url=http://jaduka.com/|publisher=Network Enhanced Telecom, LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=PrivaTel |title=website |url=http://www.privatel.com/about.php |publisher=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714001124/http://www.privatel.com/about.php |archivedate=July 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grabbit===
In 2009 Davis founded Grabbit, with Lisa Padilla and Peter Karnig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grabbit|title=Team|url=http://grabbit.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=3|work=Grabbit.net website|publisher=Grabbit, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Needle|first=David|title=Has Grabbit got hold of the 'Next Big Thing?'|url=http://www.internetnews.com/dneedle/2009/06/has-grabbit-got-hold-of-the-ne.html|newspaper=InternetNews.com|date=June 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grabbit is an open source social media platform that integrates social network and other content streams into a single stream that can be filtered by social networks, content sources, keywords, users, and so on. Users can add many types of real-time streams, updates, and alerts such as RSS feeds, e-mail alerts, news alerts, blog alerts, alarms and reminders, shopping alerts, and more across a broad range of social networks, information, media, and commerce. Grabbit also gives users a powerful set of tools for managing and discovering friends, contacts, and groups of contacts across a wide variety of social and business networks. Grabbit was built with Drupal, and the open source project and source code is published on Github. In partnership with Cognition, Grabbit developed new semantic technology to analyze social media, blog posts, friends, locations, media consumption, product purchases, brand preferences, and other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arnold|first=Stephen E|title=Cognition Grabs Grabbit|url=http://arnoldit.com/wordpress/2010/10/15/cognition-grabs-grabbit/|newspaper=Beyond Search|date=October 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this work, Davis filed a patent application titled "Semantically Generating Personalized Recommendations Based on Social Feeds to a User in Real-Time and Display Methods Thereof."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Frederic E.|title=Semantically Generating Personalized Recommendations Based on Social Feeds to a User in Real-Time and Display Methods Thereof|url=http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PG01&amp;s1=padilla&amp;s2=semantic&amp;OS=padilla+AND+semantic&amp;RS=padilla+AND+semantic|work=Patent Application Number: 20120101806|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other work==
From 1996 to mid-1997, Davis served as director of Strategic Development for CMP Media, during the period leading up to its successful IPO, in August 1997. While working for CMP Media's CEO, Ken Cron, on long-range business strategies, Davis also wrote articles and columns in various CMP publications, including ''[[Windows Magazine]]'', ''Home PC'', and ''[[Computer Reseller News]]''.

Davis was a columnist for the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' and was the US columnist for ''EYE-COM'', one of Japan's leading computer magazines. Davis was also a regular technology commentator for National Public Radio's ''[[All Things Considered]]'' and is the former cohost of the radio call-in show ''On Computers'', with [[John Dvorak]], [[Gina Smith (author)|Gina Smith]], and [[Leo LaPorte]]. Davis also served as president of the Computer Institute, a nonprofit scientific and cultural foundation involved in education research and the study of human/computer ecology. Davis was also the founder of the Festival of Computer and Multimedia Arts (CoMA) in San Francisco.

Davis is the author of more than a dozen computer books, including ''The Complete IBM Personal Computer''—the first hardware expansion guide to the IBM PC, published in the early 1980s. His 1985 book, ''Desktop Publishing'' (with coauthors John Barry and Michael Wiesenberg), helped popularize the term and received an award from the Computer Press Association. The ''New York Times'' hailed Davis's ''Windows 3.1 Bible'' as "the best" book on the topic. Davis also developed the ''Windows Bible'' CD-ROM, released in early 1994. The ''Windows 95 Bible'' was released in April 1996, and his ''Windows 98 Bible'' (with coauthor Kip Crosby) was published in April 1998.

Davis has been named one of the most influential people in the tech industry by several publications in both the US and Japan and is listed in [[Marquis Who's Who]] in [[United States of America|America]]. Davis has been widely quoted in publications such as ''[[Business Week]]'', the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', the ''[[New York Times]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', and ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' and has appeared on many radio and television programs, including NPR's ''All Things Considered'', ''CBS Evening News'', and ''ABC News Tonight''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4983">'''Free Shipping Day''' is a one-day event held annually in mid-December. On the promotional holiday, [[consumer]]s can shop from both large and small online merchants that offer free shipping with guaranteed delivery by [[Christmas Eve]]. 

== History ==
Free Shipping Day was started in 2008 by Luke and Maisie Knowles, founders of Coupon Sherpa and FreeShipping.org,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeshipping.org FreeShipping.org]&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to extend the online shopping season. Statistics at the time showed online shopping peaked on [[Cyber Monday]], generally held the week immediately following [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]. Consumers believed they would not receive their online orders in time for [[Christmas]] after that date.

The first event was created in two weeks by Knowles. Several hundred merchants participated and media attention was unusually high. In 2009, more than 750 retailers participated, with 350,000 plus sales taking place through the official site www.FreeShippingDay.com. Merchant participation has more than doubled each subsequent year. Knowles talked with [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]] blogger Brad Tuttle in 2010 about the role of free shipping as a promotional tool, saying, "I see a trend of free shipping offers around the holidays having a lower threshold than they have in years past...we are seeing more merchants offering free shipping on ALL orders" &lt;ref&gt;[http://business.time.com/2010/12/17/qa-with-free-shipping-day-founder-luke-knowles/ "Q&amp;A with Free Shipping Day Founder Luke Knowles,"], ''TIME''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free Shipping Day was featured on [[The Today Show|NBC's ''Today'' Show]], ''[[Fox Business (TV program)|Fox Business]]'', [[CNN]] and [[Early Show|CBS's ''Early Show'']], as well as in the ''[[New York Times]]'', ''[[Real Simple]]'', ''[[Better Homes and Gardens (magazine)|Better Homes and Gardens]]'', [[O magazine|"O" Magazine]] and more than 70 other media outlets.

In 2010, the third Free Shipping Day began at 12 a.m. EST on Friday, Dec. 17, and ended at 12 a.m. EST, Dec. 18. More than 1,700 merchants from all 50 states participated and the official site saw 317,000 unique visitors. Online shoppers spent $942 million to make Free Shipping Day the third highest spending day of the 2010 holiday season,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizreport.com/2010/12/green-monday-free-shipping-day-combine-for-hot-spending-week.html# "Green Monday, Free Shipping Day Combine For Hot Spending Week"], Biz Report.&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately boosting online sales 61 percent from 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2374540,00.asp "Free Shipping Day Helps Boost Online Sales 61 Percent"], PC Mag.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Free Shipping Day became a billion-dollar shopping holiday with $1.072 billion in sales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lipsman|first1=Andrew|title=Free Shipping Day Punctuates Heavy Week of Online Holiday Shopping as Four Individual Days Eclipse $1 Billion in Spending and Season-to-Date Exceeds $30 Billion|url=http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press-Releases/2011/12/Free-Shipping-Day-Punctuates-Heavy-Week-of-Online-Holiday-Shopping?cs_edgescape_cc=US|website=comScore|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by $1.01 billion during Free Shipping Day 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lipsman|first1=Andrew|title='Free Shipping Day' Promotion Spurs Late-Season Online Spending Surge, Improving Season-to-Date Growth Rate to 16 Percent vs. Year Ago|url=http://ir.comscore.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=728639|website=comScore|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Knowles changed the format of Free Shipping Day to only include merchants that could waive all minimum order requirements and guarantee delivery by Christmas Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kenyon|first1=Jacqui|title=Save More on Your Holiday Shopping: Free Shipping Day Is December 18|url=https://www.learnvest.com/2013/12/save-more-on-your-holiday-shopping-free-shipping-day-is-december-18/|website=LearnVest.com|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales during the event on December 18, 2013, were $868 million, jumping to $926 million the following year.

== Global ==
A Dutch pair of entrepreneurs adapted the concept in 2010 and created GratisBezorging.nl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mydealsclub.com/gratisbezorging-nl-netherlands-answer-free-shipping-day/|title=Gratisbezorging.nl – Netherlands Answer To Free Shipping Day|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=My Deals Club|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event creators have also branched out into [[Canada]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.FreeShippingDay.ca Free Shipping Day], Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.FreeDeliveryDay.com Free Delivery Day], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="88808">A rapidly increasing list of '''graphene production techniques''' have been developed to enable [[graphene]]'s use in commercial applications.

Isolated 2D crystals cannot be grown via chemical synthesis beyond small sizes even in principle, because the rapid growth of [[phonon]] density with increasing lateral size forces 2D crystallites to bend into the third dimension.&lt;ref name=Sciencerev09&gt;{{cite journal |last=Geim |first=A. |year=2009 |title=Graphene: Status and Prospects |journal=Science |pmid=19541989 |volume=324 |issue=5934 |doi=10.1126/science.1158877 |bibcode=2009Sci...324.1530G |pages=1530–4 |arxiv=0906.3799 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other routes to [[2d materials]] exist:
{{quote|Fundamental forces place seemingly insurmountable barriers in the way of creating [2D crystals]... The nascent 2D crystallites try to minimize their surface energy and inevitably morph into one of the rich variety of stable 3D structures that occur in soot.

But there is a way around the problem. Interactions with 3D structures stabilize 2D crystals during growth. So one can make 2D crystals sandwiched between or placed on top of the atomic planes of a bulk crystal. In that respect, graphene already exists within graphite... One can then hope to fool Nature and extract single-atom-thick crystallites at a low enough temperature that they remain in the quenched state prescribed by the original higher-temperature 3D growth.&lt;ref name="PhysTod" /&gt;}}

The early approaches of [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleaving]] multi-layer graphite into single layers or growing it epitaxially by depositing a layer of carbon onto another material have been supplemented by numerous alternatives. In all cases, the graphite must bond to some substrate to retain its 2d shape.&lt;ref name="Sciencerev09" /&gt;

==Exfoliation==

As of 2014 exfoliation produced graphene with the lowest number of defects and highest electron mobility.&lt;ref name="arx1406"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Kusmartsev |first1=F. V. |last2=Wu |first2=W. M. |last3=Pierpoint |first3=M. P. |last4=Yung |first4=K. C. |title=Application of Graphene within Optoelectronic Devices and Transistors |eprint=1406.0809 |class=cond-mat.mtrl-sci|year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adhesive tape ===
[[Andre Geim]] and [[Konstantin Novoselov]] initially used [[adhesive tape]] to split [[graphite]] into graphene. Achieving single layers typically requires multiple exfoliation steps, each producing a slice with fewer layers, until only one remains. After exfoliation the flakes are deposited on a silicon wafer. Crystallites larger than 1&amp;nbsp;mm and visible to the naked eye can be obtained.&lt;ref name="PhysTod"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Geim |first=A. K. |last2=MacDonald |first2=A. H. |title=Graphene: Exploring carbon flatland |journal=Physics Today |volume=60 |pages=35–41 |year=2007 |doi=10.1063/1.2774096 |bibcode=2007PhT....60h..35G |issue=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wedge-based ===

===Graphite oxide reduction===

Later the oxidation protocol was enhanced to yield [[graphene oxide]] with an almost intact carbon framework that allows efficient removal of functional groups, neither of which was originally possible.

===Shearing===
In 2014 defect-free, unoxidized graphene-containing liquids were made from graphite using [[Blender|mixers]] that produce local shear rates greater than {{val|10|e=4}}. The method was claimed to be applicable to other 2D materials, including [[boron nitride]], [[Molybdenum disulfide]] and other layered crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/a-new-method-of-producing-large-volumes-of-high-quality-graphene |title=A new method of producing large volumes of high-quality graphene |publisher=KurzweilAI |date=2 May 2014 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nmat3944 | title=Scalable production of large quantities of defect-free few-layer graphene by shear exfoliation in liquids | journal=Nature Materials | date=2014 | volume=13 | issue=6 | pages=624–630 | first=Keith R. | last=Paton|bibcode = 2014NatMa..13..624P | pmid=24747780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispersing graphite in a proper liquid medium can produce graphene by [[sonication]].

The maximum concentrations achieved are the points at which the [[van der Waals force]]s overcome the interactive forces between the graphene sheets and the solvent molecules.

Adding a [[surfactant]] to a solvent prior to sonication prevents restacking by adsorbing to the graphene's surface. This produces a higher graphene concentration, but removing the surfactant requires chemical treatments.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

====Immiscible liquids====

Sonicating graphite at the interface of two [[Miscibility|immiscible]] liquids, most notably [[heptane]] and water, produced macro-scale graphene films. The graphene sheets are adsorbed to the high energy interface between the heptane and the water, where they are kept from restacking. The graphene remained at the interface even when exposed to force in excess of 300,000 g. The solvents may then be evaporated. The sheets are up to ~95% transparent and conductive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Conductive Thin Films of Pristine Graphene by Solvent Interface Trapping|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn402371c|journal = ACS Nano|date = 2013-08-27|issn = 1936-0851|pages = 7062–7066|volume = 7|issue = 8|doi = 10.1021/nn402371c|first = Steven J.|last = Woltornist|first2 = Andrew J.|last2 = Oyer|first3 = Jan-Michael Y.|last3 = Carrillo|first4 = Andrey V.|last4 = Dobrynin|first5 = Douglas H.|last5 = Adamson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrochemical synthesis ===
Electrochemical synthesis can exfoliate graphene. Varying a pulsed voltage controls thickness, flake area, number of defects and affects its properties. The process begins by bathing the graphite in a solvent for intercalation. The process can be tracked by monitoring the solution’s transparency with an LED and photodiode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = How to tune graphene properties by introducing defects {{!}} KurzweilAI|url = http://www.kurzweilai.net/how-to-tune-graphene-properties-by-introducing-defects|website = www.kurzweilai.net|accessdate = 2015-10-11|date = July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Controlling the properties of graphene produced by electrochemical exfoliation - IOPscience|url = http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-4484/26/33/335607 |date = 2015-08-21|doi = 10.1088/0957-4484/26/33/335607 |first = Mario|last = Hofmann|first2 = Wan-Yu|last2 = Chiang|first3 = Tuân D|last3 = Nguyễn|first4 = Ya-Ping|last4 = Hsieh|volume=26|journal=Nanotechnology|page=335607|bibcode = 2015Nanot..26G5607H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrothermal self-assembly==
Graphene has been prepared by using a sugar (e.g. [[glucose]], [[fructose]], etc.) This substrate-free "bottom-up" synthesis is safer, simpler and more environmentally friendly than exfoliation. The method can control thickness, ranging from monolayer to multilayers.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tang | first1 = L. | last2 = Li | first2 = X. | last3 = Ji | first3 = R. | last4 = Teng | first4 = K.

==Epitaxy==

[[Epitaxy]] refers to the deposition of a crystalline overlayer on a crystalline substrate, where there is registry between the two. In some cases epitaxial graphene layers are coupled to surfaces weakly enough (by [[Van der Waals force]]s) to retain the two dimensional [[electronic band structure]] of isolated graphene.&lt;ref name=Gall1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gall |first=N.

===Chemical vapor deposition===

[[Chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) is a common form of epitaxy. The process of deposition of solid material onto a heated substrate through decomposition or chemical reaction of compounds contained in the gas passing over the substrate is called chemical vapor deposition. The reactants, generally in the gaseous or vapor phase, react on or near the surface of the substrates, which are at some elevated temperature. The subsequent reaction results in the deposition of atoms or molecules on the entire substrate surface. CVD processes are also widely used for growing epitaxial layers such as a silicon epitaxial layer on a single-crystal silicon substrate (homoepitaxy or commonly referred to as epitaxy) or epitaxial layer deposition on a sapphire (Heteroepitaxy).&lt;ref name= "The surface science of graphene: Metal interfaces, CVD synthesis, nanoribbons, chemical modifications, and defects"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.surfrep.2011.12.001 | title = The surface science of graphene: Metal interfaces, CVD synthesis, nanoribbons, chemical modifications, and defects| journal =Surface Science Reports| year = 2012| last1 = Batzill | first1 = M. | volume=67 | pages=83–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Direct epitaxial CVD synthesis of tungsten disulfide on epitaxial and CVD graphene"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/C5RA19698A | title = Direct epitaxial CVD synthesis of tungsten disulfide on epitaxial and CVD graphene | journal = Royal Society of Chemistry Advances | year = 2015 | last1 = Bianco | first1 = G.

This process is usually carried out for certain combinations of substrate and layer materials and under special deposition conditions.

==Epitaxy of graphene==

Epitaxial graphene films can be grown on various crystalline surfaces. The atomic lattice of the substrate facilitate in orientationally registering the carbon atoms of the graphene layer. The chemical interaction of the graphene with the substrate can vary from weak to strong. This also modifies the properties of the graphene layer. The need for epitaxial graphene arises from the challenges of incorporating carbon nanotubes in large-scale integrated electronic architectures. Research on 2D graphene was thus initiated by experiments on epitaxially grown graphene on single crystal silicon carbide. While significant control has been in growing and characterizing epitaxial graphene, challenges remain in being able to fully exploit the potential of these structures. The promise lies in the hope that charge carriers on these graphene structures, like carbon nanotubes, remain ballistic. If so, it could  revolutionize the world of electronics.&lt;ref name= "Epitaxial graphene"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0022-3727/45/15/150301 | title = Epitaxial graphene | journal = Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics | year = 2012 | last1 = de Heer | first1 = W.

===Silicon carbide===

{{Main|Tunable nanoporous carbon|l1=Carbide-derived Carbon}}

Heating [[silicon carbide]] (SiC) to high temperatures (&gt;{{val|1100|u=°C}}) under low pressures (~10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; torr) reduces it to graphene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sutter |first=P. |title=Epitaxial graphene: How silicon leaves the scene |journal=Nature Materials |volume=8 |year=2009 |pmid=19229263 |doi=10.1038/nmat2392 |issue=3 |bibcode=2009NatMa...8..171S |pages=171–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process produces epitaxial graphene with dimensions dependent upon the size of the wafer. The face of the SiC used for graphene formation, silicon- or carbon-terminated, highly influences the thickness, mobility and carrier density.

===Metal single crystal substrates===

Metal single crystals are often used as substrates in graphene growth since they form a smooth and chemically uniform growth platform for graphene. Especially, the chemical uniformity is an important advantage of metal single crystal surfaces: for example in different oxide surfaces the oxidized component and the oxygen forms very different adsorption sites. A typical metal single crystal substrate surface is [[hexagonal close-packed]] surface since this geometry is also the geometry of carbon atoms in a graphene layer. Common surfaces that have hexagonal close packed geometry are for example [[face-centered cubic|FCC(111)]] and [[hexagonal close-packed|HCP(0001)]] surfaces. Of course, the similar surface geometries alone do not ensure perfect graphene adsorption on the surface since the distances between surface metal atoms and carbon atoms can be different, resulting in moiré patterns. Common metal surfaces for graphene growth are Pt(111), Ir(111), Ni(111), Ru(0001), Co(0001) and Cu(111)&lt;ref name= "The surface science of graphene: Metal interfaces, CVD synthesis, nanoribbons, chemical modifications, and defects"/&gt; but also at least Fe(110), Au(111), Pd(111), Re(101͊0) and Rh(111) have been used.&lt;ref name="Growth of epitaxial graphene: Theory and experiment"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.physrep.2014.03.003| title = growth of epitaxial graphene: Theory and experiment| journal = Physics Reports| year = 2014| last1 = Tetlow | first1 = H. | last2 = Posthuma de Boer | first2 = J.| last3 = Ford | first3 = I.

====Preparation methods of metal single crystal substrates====

There are several methods how good quality metal single crystal substrates can be manufactured. [[Czochralski]] and [[Bridgman–Stockbarger technique|Bridgman–Stockbarger]] methods are common industrial methods for bulk metal crystal manufacturing. In these methods, the metal is first melted, after which the metal is let to crystallize around a seed crystal. After crystallization, the crystal is cut into wafers. Other commonly used method especially in research is epitaxy, which enables the growth of numerous different metal single crystal surfaces on some commonly available single crystals like monocrystalline silicon.&lt;ref name= "Single crystal growth with the Czochralski method involving rotational electromagnetic stirring of the melt"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0022-0248(94)90187-2 | title = Single crystal growth with the Czochralski method involving rotational electromagnetic stirring of the melt | journal = Journal of Crystal Growth | year = 1994 | last1 = Brückner | first1 = F.-U. | last2 = Schwerdtfeger | first2 = K. | volume = 139 | pages = 351–356}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of epitaxy over the industrial methods is its low material consumption: with epitaxy substrates with thickness in nanometer scale can be manufactured in comparison to complete self-supporting wafers. This is especially important with rare and expensive metals like rhenium and gold.

===Ruthenium(0001)===

Graphene can be grown on [[ruthenium|ruthenium(0001)]] surface with CVD, temperature programmed growth (TPG) or [[Segregation (materials science)|segregation]].&lt;ref name = "Growth of epitaxial graphene: Theory and experiment"/&gt; In CVD, a hot ruthenium surface is exposed for some carbon containing molecule like [[methane]] or [[ethene]]. This results in graphene formation. It has been observed that the graphene can grow only “downhill” of the ruthenium surface steps, not uphill.&lt;ref name="Epitaxial graphene on ruthenium"/&gt; 
Graphene bonds strongly with [[covalent bond]]s to the surface and has only 1.45 Å separation to the surface.&lt;ref name="Epitaxial graphene on ruthenium"/&gt; This affects the electronic structure of the graphene layer, and the layer behaves differently than a free-standing graphene layer. However, the CVD graphene growth on ruthenium is not totally self-terminating and multilayer graphene formation is possible. The second and higher layers cannot bond to the existing graphene layers as strongly as the first layer bonds to the metal surface, which results in higher 3 Å separation between the graphene layers. The second layer thus has much weaker interaction with the substrate and has very similar electronic properties as free-standing graphene.
Due to the strong bonding of graphene on the ruthenium surface, only R0 orientation is observed for graphene layer. Although, different studies have shown different lengths for the [[moiré pattern|moiré]] repeat distance, varying around Graphene(11 x 11) and Ru(10 x 10).&lt;ref name="Growth of epitaxial graphene: Theory and experiment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Periodically Rippled Graphene: Growth and Spatially Resolved Electronic Structure"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.056807| title = Periodically Rippled Graphene: Growth and Spatially Resolved Electronic Structure| journal = Physical Review Letters| year = 2008| last1 = Vasquez de Parga | first1 = A.

Another method used temperatures compatible with conventional [[CMOS]] processing, using a nickel-based alloy with a gold catalyst.&lt;ref name="cmosgraphene"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weatherup |first=R.S. |last2=Bayer |first2=Bernhard C. |last3=Blume |first3=Raoul |last4=Ducati |first4=Caterina |last5=Baehtz |first5=Carsten |last6=Schlögl |first6=Robert |last7=Hofmann |first7=Stephan |year=2011 |title=In Situ Characterization of Alloy Catalysts for Low-Temperature Graphene Growth |journal=Nano Letters |doi=10.1021/nl202036y |volume=11 |issue=10 |pages=4154–60 |pmid=21905732 |bibcode=2011NanoL..11.4154W }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process dissolves carbon atoms inside a [[transition metal]] melt at a certain temperature and then precipitates the dissolved carbon at lower temperatures as single layer graphene (SLG).

The metal is first melted in contact with a carbon source, possibly a graphite crucible inside which the melt is carried out or graphite powder/chunks that are placed in the melt. Keeping the melt in contact with the carbon at a specific temperature dissolves the carbon atoms, saturating the melt based on the metal–carbon [[binary phase diagram]]. Lowering the temperature decreases carbon's solubility and the excess carbon precipitates onto the melt. The floating layer can be either skimmed or frozen for later removal.

Using different morphology, including thick graphite, few layer graphene (FLG) and SLG were observed on metal substrate. [[Raman spectroscopy]] proved that SLG had grown on nickel substrate. The SLG Raman spectrum featured no D and D′ band, indicating its pristine nature. Since nickel is not Raman active, direct Raman spectroscopy of graphene layers on top of the nickel is achievable.&lt;ref name="shaahin"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Shaahin |last=Amini |first2=Javier |last2=Garay |first3=Guanxiong |last3=Liu |first4=Alexander A. |last4=Balandin |first5=Reza |last5=Abbaschian |title=Growth of Large-Area Graphene Films from Metal–Carbon Melts |journal=Journal of Applied Physics |volume=108 |issue=9 |page=094321 |year=2010 |doi=10.1063/1.3498815 |bibcode=2010JAP...108i4321A |arxiv=1011.4081 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach covered a sheet of silicon dioxide glass (the substrate) on one side with a nickel film. Graphene deposited via chemical vapor deposition formed into layers on both sides of the film, one on the exposed top side, and one on the underside, sandwiched between nickel and glass. Peeling the nickel and the top layer of graphene left an intervening layer of graphene on the glass. While the top graphene layer could be harvested from the foil as in earlier methods, the bottom layer was already in place on the glass. The quality and purity of the attached layer was not assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/graphene-glass-substrate-deposition/32271 |title=New process could lead to more widespread use of graphene |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cobalt(0001)===

===Copper===

[[Copper]] foil, at room temperature and very low pressure and in the presence of small amounts of [[methane]] produces high quality graphene. The growth automatically stops after a single layer forms. Arbitrarily large films can be created.&lt;ref name=hongR/&gt;&lt;ref name="CopperGraphene"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Li |first=Xuesong |title=Large-Area Synthesis of High-Quality and Uniform Graphene Films on Copper Foils |year=2009 |pmid=19423775 |doi=10.1126/science.1171245 |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5932 |bibcode=2009Sci...324.1312L |pages=1312–4 |arxiv=0905.1712 |last2=Cai | first2=W|last3=An |first3=Jinho |last4=Kim |first4=Seyoung |last5=Nah |first5=Junghyo |last6=Yang |first6=Dongxing |last7=Piner |first7=Richard |last8=Velamakanni |first8=Aruna |last9=Jung |first9=Inhwa |last10=Tutuc |first10=Emanuel |last11=Banerjee |first11=Sanjay K. |last12=Colombo |first12=Luigi |last13=Ruoff |first13=Rodney S. |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single layer growth is due to the low concentration of carbon in methane.

A chemical reaction between the hydrogen plasma formed from the methane and ordinary air molecules in the chamber generates [[cyano radical]]s—carbon–nitrogen molecules without electrons. These charged molecules scour away surface imperfections, providing a pristine substrate. The graphene deposits form lines that merge into each other, forming a seamless sheet that contributes to mechanical and electrical integrity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.rdmag.com/news/2015/03/cool-process-make-better-graphene|title = Cool process to make better graphene|last = Than|first = Ker|date = 2015-03-18|work = R&amp;D|access-date = April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low-temperature as well as the transfer free graphene growth on substrates is the major concern of graphene research for its practical applications.

A highly exothermic reaction combusts [[magnesium]] in an oxidation–reduction reaction with carbon dioxide, producing a variety of carbon nanoparticles including graphene and [[fullerene]]s.

== Supersonic spray ==
Supersonic acceleration of droplets through a [[Laval nozzle]] was used to deposit small droplets of reduced graphene-oxide in suspension on a substrate. The droplets disperse evenly, evaporate rapidly and display reduced flake aggregations. In addition, the topological defects ([[Stone-Wales defect]] and {{chem|C|2}} vacancies) originally  in the flakes disappeared. The result was a higher quality graphene layer.

Another approach sprays buckyballs at supersonic speeds onto a substrate. The balls cracked open upon impact, and the resulting unzipped cages then bond together to form a graphene film. The buckyballs are released into a helium or hydrogen gas, which expands at supersonic speeds, carrying the carbon balls with it. The buckyballs achieve energies of around 40 keV without changing their internal dynamics. This material contains hexagons and pentagons that come from the original structures. The pentagons could introduce a band gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = How to Make Graphene Using Supersonic Buckyballs {{!}} MIT Technology Review|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/view/539911/how-to-make-graphene-using-supersonic-buckyballs|website = MIT Technology Review|accessdate = 2015-10-11|date = August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intercalation==
Producing graphene via intercalation splits graphite into single layer graphene by inserting guest molecules/ions between the graphite layers. Graphite was first intercalated in 1841 using a strong oxidizing or reducing agent that damaged the material's desirable properties. Kovtyukhova developed a widely used oxidative intercalation method in 1999. In 2014, she was able to achieve intercalation using non-oxidizing [[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory|Brønsted acids]] ([[Phosphoric acid|phosphoric]], [[sulfuric]], dichloroacetic and alkylsulfonic acids), but without oxidizing agents. The new method has yet to achieve output sufficient for commercialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nchem.2054|title = Non-oxidative intercalation and exfoliation of graphite by Brønsted acids|last = Kovtyukhova|first = Nina I.,|date = 7 September 2014|journal = Nature Chemistry|accessdate = December 2014|doi = 10.1038/nchem.2054|pmid =|volume=6|pages=957–963|bibcode = 2014NatCh...6..957K |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.kurzweilai.net/discovery-shows-route-to-industrial-scale-production-of-graphene|title = Discovery shows route to industrial-scale production of graphene|date = 9 September 2014|work = KurzweilAI|accessdate = December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laser==
In 2014 a laser-based single-step, scalable approach to graphene production was announced. The technique produced and patterned porous three-dimensional graphene film networks from commercial polymer films. The system used a CO2&amp;nbsp;[[infrared laser]]. The sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-carbon atoms were photothermally converted to sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-carbon atoms by pulsed laser irradiation. The result exhibits high electrical conductivity. The material can produce interdigitated electrodes for in-plane microsupercapacitors with specific capacitances of &gt;4 mF cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;and power densities of ~9&amp;nbsp;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. Laser-induced production appeared to allow roll-to-roll manufacturing processes and provides a route to electronic and energy storage devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ncomms6714| title = Laser-induced porous graphene films from commercial polymers| journal = Nature Communications| volume = 5| page = 5714| year = 2014| last1 = Lin | first1 = J. | last2 = Peng | first2 = Z. | last3 = Liu | first3 = Y. | last4 = Ruiz-Zepeda | first4 = F. | last5 = Ye | first5 = R. | last6 = Samuel | first6 = E.

Applying a layer of graphite oxide film to a [[DVD]] and burning it in a DVD writer produced a thin graphene film with high electrical conductivity (1738 siemens per meter) and specific surface area (1520 square meters per gram) that was highly resistant and malleable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6074/1326 |title=Laser Scribing of High-Performance and Flexible Graphene-Based Electrochemical Capacitors |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=16 March 2012 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |last=Marcus |first=Jennifer |url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ucla-researchers-develop-new-graphene-230478.aspx |title=Researchers develop graphene supercapacitor holding promise for portable electronics / UCLA Newsroom |publisher=Newsroom.ucla.edu |date=15 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach avoids use of potassium permanganate in the reaction mixture. It was also reported that by microwave radiation assistance, graphene oxide with or without holes can be synthesized by controlling microwave time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =  10.1002/smll.201403402 | volume=11 | title=Microwave Enabled One-Pot, One-Step Fabrication and Nitrogen Doping of Holey Graphene Oxide for Catalytic Applications | journal=Small | pages=3358–3368 | pmid=25683019 | year=2015 | last1 = Patel | first1 = M | last2 = Feng | first2 = W | last3 = Savaram | first3 = K | last4 = Khoshi | first4 = MR | last5 = Huang | first5 = R | last6 = Sun | first6 = J | last7 = Rabie | first7 = E | last8 = Flach | first8 = C | last9 = Mendelsohn | first9 = R | last10 = Garfunkel | first10 = E | last11 = He | first11 = H}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method uses a recipe similar to Hummer's method, but uses microwave heating instead of traditional heating. Microwave heating can dramatically shorten the reaction time from days to seconds.

== Ion implantation ==
Accelerating carbon ions under an electrical field into a semiconductor made of thin Ni films on a substrate of SiO2/Si, creates a wafer-scale ({{Convert|4|in}}) wrinkle/tear/residue-free graphene layer that changes the semiconductor's physical, chemical and electrical properties. The process uses 20 keV and a dose of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; at a relatively low temperature of 500 °C. This was followed by high-temperature activation annealing (600–900 °C) to form an sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-bonded structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Korean researchers grow wafer-scale graphene on a silicon substrate {{!}} KurzweilAI|url = http://www.kurzweilai.net/korean-researchers-grow-wafer-scale-graphene-on-a-silicon-substrate|website = www.kurzweilai.net|accessdate = 2015-10-11|date = July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Wafer-scale synthesis of multi-layer graphene by high-temperature carbon ion implantation|url = http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/apl/107/3/10.1063/1.4926605|journal = Applied Physics Letters|date = 2015-07-20|issn = 0003-6951|page = 033104|volume = 107|issue = 3|doi = 10.1063/1.4926605|first = Janghyuk|last = Kim|first2 = Geonyeop|last2 = Lee|first3 = Jihyun|last3 = Kim|bibcode = 2015ApPhL.107c3104K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Graphene characterization techniques ==

=== Low-Energy and Photoemission Electron Microscopy ===

[[Low-energy electron microscopy]] (LEEM) and [[photoemission electron microscopy]] (PEEM) are techniques suited to performing dynamic observations of surfaces with nanometer resolution in a vacuum. With LEEM, it is possible to carry out [[low-energy electron diffraction]] (LEED) and micro-LEED experiments. LEED is the standard method for studying the surface structure of a crystalline material. Low-energy electrons (20–200 eV) impact the surface and elastically backscattered electrons illuminate a diffraction pattern on a fluorescent screen. The LEED method is a surface-sensitive technique as electrons have low energy and are not able to penetrate deep into the sample. For example, a micro-sized LEED revealed the presence of rotational variations of graphene on SiC substrate.&lt;ref name= "Epitaxial Graphene on SiC: A Review of Growth and Characterization"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3390/cryst6050053 | title = Epitaxial Graphene on SiC: A Review of Growth and Characterization| journal =Crystals | year = 2016| last1 = Yazdi | first1 = G.

=== Raman spectroscopy and microscopy ===

[[Raman spectroscopy]] can provide information about the number of layers on graphene stacks, the atomic structure of graphene edges, disorder and defects, the stacking order between different layers, the effect of strain, and charge transfer. Graphene has three main features in its Raman spectrum, called the D, G, and 2D (also called G’) modes that appear at about 1350, 1583 and 2700 cm-1.&lt;ref name= "Epitaxial Graphene on SiC: A Review of Growth and Characterization"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Raman spectroscopy in graphene"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.physrep.2009.02.003 | title = Raman spectroscopy in graphene| journal = Physics Reports | year = 2009 | last1 = Malard | first1 = L. M. | last2 = Pimenta | first2 = M. A. | last3 = Dresselhaus | first3 = G. | last4 = Dresselhaus | first4 = M. S. | volume = 473 | pages=51–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scanning tunneling microscopy ===

In [[scanning tunneling microscopy]] (STM), a sharp tip scans the surface of a sample in a regime of such tip-sample distances that electrons can [[tunnel|quantum tunneling]] from the tip to the sample surface or vice versa. STM can be performed in a constant current or a constant height mode. The low temperature STM measurements provide thermal stability, which is a requirement for high resolution imaging and spectroscopic analysis. The first atomically resolved images of graphene grown on a platinum substrate were obtained using STM in the 1990s.&lt;ref name= "Epitaxial Graphene on SiC: A Review of Growth and Characterization"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "STM investigation of single layer graphite structures produced on Pt(111) by hydrocarbon decomposition"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0039-6028(92)90183-7 | title = STM investigation of single layer graphite structures produced on Pt(111) by hydrocarbon decomposition| journal = Surface Science | year = 1992 | last1 = Land | first1 = T.

=== Atomic and electrostatic force microscopy ===

[[Atomic force microscopy]] (AFM) is mostly used to measure the force between atoms located at the sharp point of the tip (located on the cantilever) and atoms at the sample surface.&lt;ref name= "Epitaxial Graphene on SiC: A Review of Growth and Characterization"/&gt; The bending of the cantilever as a result of the interaction between the tip and the sample is detected and converted to an electrical signal.  The electrostatic force microscopy mode of AFM has been used to detect the surface potential of graphene layers as a function of thickness variation allowing for quantification of potential difference maps showing distinction between graphene layers of different thicknesses.&lt;ref name= "Epitaxial Graphene on SiC: A Review of Growth and Characterization"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Mapping of Local Electrical Properties in Epitaxial Graphene Using Electrostatic Force Microscopy"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/nl200581g | title = Mapping of Local Electrical Properties in Epitaxial Graphene Using Electrostatic Force Microscopy| journal = Nano Letters | year = 2011 | last1 = Burnett | first1 = T. | last2 = Yakimova | first2 = R. | last3 = Kazakova | first3 = O. | volume = 11 | pages = 2324–2328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transmission electron microscopy ===

[[Transmission electron microscopy]] (TEM) uses electrons to generate high-resolution images as using electrons allows to overcome limitations of visible light wavelengths. TEM on graphene should be done with electron energy less than 80 keV to induce a smaller amount of defects, because this energy is the threshold electron energy for damaging a single-wall carbon nano-tube.&lt;ref name= "Epitaxial Graphene on SiC: A Review of Growth and Characterization"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Electron irradiation effects in single wall carbon nanotubes"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1383020 | title = Electron irradiation effects in single wall carbon nanotubes| journal = Journal of Applied Physics | year = 2001 | last1 = Smith | first1 = B. W. | last2 = Luzzi | first2 = D. E. | volume = 90 | pages = 3509–3515}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some other difficulties in the study of graphene by TEM, e.g., in a plane-view geometry (top-view graphene) the substrate causes strong electron scattering, and a thick substrate makes it impossible to detect the graphene layer. For a cross-section view, detecting a monolayer graphene is a difficult task as it needs simulation of the TEM images.&lt;ref name= "Epitaxial Graphene on SiC: A Review of Growth and Characterization"/&gt;

=== Scanning electron microscopy ===

In [[scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM), a high-energy electron beam (ranging a few 100 eVs to a few keVs) is used to generate a variety of signals at the surface of a sample. These signals which come from the electron-sample interactions expose information about the sample, including surface morphology, crystalline structure, and chemical composition. SEM is also used for characterizations of the growth of graphene on SiC.&lt;ref name= "Epitaxial Graphene on SiC: A Review of Growth and Characterization"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "SEM and Raman analysis of graphene on SiC(0001)"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.micron.2015.05.013 | title = SEM and Raman analysis of graphene on SiC(0001)| journal = Micron | year = 2016 | last1 = Grodecki | first1 = K. | last2 = Jozwik | first2 = I. | last3 = Baranowski | first3 = J. M. | last4 = Teklinska | first4 = D. | last5 = Strupinski | first5 = W. | volume = 80 | pages = 20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its atomic thickness, graphene is usually detected with [[secondary electrons]] that probe only a sample surface. With SEM imaging, different contrast can be observed, such as thickness, roughness, and edge contrast; the brighter area shows the thinner part of the graphene layers.&lt;ref name= "SEM and Raman analysis of graphene on SiC(0001)"/&gt; The roughness contrast of a graphene layer is due to the different numbers of secondary electrons detected. The defects such as wrinkles, ruptures, and folds can be studied by different contrast in SEM images.&lt;ref name= "Epitaxial Graphene on SiC: A Review of Growth and Characterization"/&gt;

== History ==
In 1923, the 18-year-old photographer Martin Hanke founded the Hamaphot KG (limited partnership) in Dresden which specialized in photo accessories. When Dresden was bombarded in the Second World War, the company was destroyed. It was rebuilt in Monheim in 1945. In 1958, the first synchronized flash powder device was presented, in 1972 the world's first automatic film splicer. Three years later, the "Hamafix" slide mounting system came onto the market. In 1990, Hama established their [[United Kingdom|UK]] branch '''Hama PVAC Ltd.''' (Hama Photo, Video, Audio, Communications) and are UK [[Distribution (business)|distributor]] for [[Celestron]], [[Tasco]], [[Sandisk]], [[Vivitar]] and [[Koss (company)|Koss]] products. In 1991, Hama launched the "Videocut 200" which - according to company representatives – was the most frequently sold video editing device in Europe at that time. In 1993, the company name changed from Hamaphot to Hama. Two years later, the "MobileSafe" mobile phone holder was put on the market. In 1998, the company celebrated its seventy-fifth anniversary.

Today, the product range does not only comprise articles for photo and video applications, but also accessories from the areas of audiovisual, multimedia, game console, telecommunications and from a number of more areas.

In [[computer science]], a '''heartbeat''' is a periodic signal generated by hardware or software to indicate normal operation or to synchronize other parts of a [[computer system]].&lt;ref name=pcmag.com&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/44190/heartbeat] pcmag.com Encyclopedia - Definition of Heartbeat.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually a heartbeat is sent between machines at a regular interval in the order of seconds. If the endpoint does not receive a heartbeat for a time—usually a few heartbeat intervals—the machine that should have sent the heartbeat is assumed to have failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aguilera|first1=Marcos Kawazoe|last2=Chen|first2=Wei|last3=Toueg|first3=Sam|title=Heartbeat: A Timeout-Free Failure Detector for Quiescent Reliable Communication|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/1997/09/wdag97_hb.pdf|publisher=Distributed Algorithms. Springer Berlin Heidelberg|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heartbeat protocol ==
A heartbeat protocol is generally used to negotiate and monitor the availability of a resource, such as a [[IP address#Uses of dynamic address assignment|floating IP address]]. Typically when a heartbeat starts on a machine, it will perform an election process with other machines on the [[heartbeat network]] to determine which machine, if any, owns the resource. On heartbeat networks of more than two machines, it is important to take into account partitioning, where two halves of the network could be functioning but not able to communicate with each other. In a situation such as this, it is important that the resource is only owned by one machine, not one machine in each partition.

As a heartbeat is intended to be used to indicate the health of a machine, it is important that the heartbeat protocol and the transport that it runs on is as reliable as possible. Causing a [[failover]] because of a false alarm may, depending on the resource, be highly undesirable. It is also important to react quickly to an actual failure, so again it is important that the heartbeat is reliable. For this reason it is often desirable to have heartbeat running over more than one transport; for instance, an [[Ethernet]] segment using [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]/[[Internet Protocol|IP]], and a serial link.

In [[war]]fare, '''High-explosive incendiary''' ('''HEI''') is a type of [[ammunition]] specially designed to impart energy and therefore damage to its target in one or both of two ways:  via a high-explosive charge and/or via its incendiary (fire-causing) effects.  Each round has both capabilities.

HEI ammunition is [[fuse (explosives)|fuse]]d either mechanically or chemically. The armor-piercing ability can vary widely, allowing for more focused fragmentation or larger scatter.

== History ==

HEI ammunition was originally developed for use in large-[[caliber]] [[cannon]], [[howitzer]] and naval [[artillery]]. Currently, HEI rounds are most commonly made in medium-caliber sizes of 20 mm, 25 mm, and 30 mm. They are fired from various platforms, including aircraft, [[anti-aircraft cannon]]s, and [[close-in weapon system|anti-missile systems]], as well as common battlefield [[howitzer]]s, though the latter has gone through a recent decline in use.

HEI ammunition has also been used on the battlefield against tanks and other armoured vehicles, but this has become impractical due to the invention of modern armour systems such as [[Chobham armour|Chobham]] and [[explosive reactive armour]], which can absorb most high-explosive rounds currently used. 

Recently, APIS ([[Armour Piercing Incendiary Shells|armour piercing incendiary shells]]) have been used; these penetrate the target using the [[kinetic energy penetrator|kinetic properties]] of the round before the incendiary round goes off, smothering the crew in flames, [[cooking off]] ammunition and igniting combustible materials, generally destroying the target.

==Uses== 
[[Image:30mm-rounds.jpg|thumb|The shell on the left is a 30mm HEI.]]
The shells were first employed in [[naval artillery|naval batteries]], but soon found their way to land-based howitzers as well. They caused fires, which on ships can be difficult to extinguish in the tight spaces. Also, fired at tanks and [[soft target]]s, they can cause fires that completely engulf the vehicle, killing anyone inside.

Occasionally HEIs were used against tanks (heavily armored) and also lightly armoured vehicles, but, since the invention of modern battle armour, such as [[Chobham armour|Chobham]], and [[Explosive Reactive Armour]], these shells have become less and less practical for anti-tank work, and more useful for destroying “soft” targets such as [[air base]]s, [[trench]]es, or [[bunker]]s, in which they can create fires of over 1000 degrees Celsius. Incendiary shells are no longer in use by many countries, due to bans on the use of [[white phosphorus (weapon)|phosphorus weapons]].

[[Armor-piercing shot and shell]] penetrate the target using [[kinetic energy]] before the incendiary charge ignites, smothering the crew in flames, detonating ammunition, and destroying the target.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1939">In [[engineering]], '''interoperation''' is the setup of ad hoc components and [[Methodology|methods]] to make two or more [[systems]] work together as a combined [[system]] with some partial functionality during a certain time, possibly requiring human [[Supervisor|supervision]] to perform necessary adjustments and [[corrections]].

This contrasts to [[interoperability]], which theoretically permits any number of [[systems]] [[Regulatory compliance|compliant]] to a given [[technical standard|standard]] to work together a long time smoothly and unattended as a combined [[system]] with the full functionality by the standard.

Another definition of interoperation: "services effectively combining multiple resources and domains...; requires interoperability".&lt;ref&gt;[http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/gio/1996/glossat.ps Glossary] Gio Wiederhold, "Glossary"; in Intelligent Integration of Information, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston MA, July 1996, pages 193--203; reprinted from the Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, Vol.6 Nos.2/3, June 1996, pages 281-291.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Interoperation is usually performed when the [[systems]] having to be combined were [[designed]] before [[standardization]] (for example [[legacy systems]]), or when standard [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] is too expensive, too difficult, or immature.

Interoperation may use following [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]], components and methods:
* [[electrical connector|Connectors]]
* [[Adapter]]s
* [[Electric power conversion|Converters]]
* [[Simulators]]
* [[Protocol bridge|Bridges]]

In the area of [[data processing]], interoperation may also use following components and methods:
* [[Callback (computer programming)|Handlers]]
* [[Plug-in (computing)|Plug-in]]s
* [[Translators]]

==Company history==

The original Intersil, Inc. was founded in 1967 by the Swiss physicist [[Jean Hoerni]] to develop digital watch [[Integrated Circuits]] (ICs). The European subsidiary Eurosil was originally partially funded by SSIH, a Swiss watch company. Later-on, Intersil had a development contract with the Japanese company Daini Seikosha and became supplier of low-voltage [[CMOS]] watch ICs for [[Seiko]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucien Trueb: ''Die Elektrifizierung der Armbanduhr.'' Ebner, Ulm 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-87188-236-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[microprocessor]]s emerged to the market in the 1970s, Intersil participated with its [[12-bit]] [[Intersil 6100|IM6100]], which was the first microprocessor produced in CMOS technology and emulated the [[PDP-8]] instruction set. In 1988 Intersil was taken over by [[Harris Semiconductor]], which had offered the IM6100 as [[second source]]. Harris combined these activities with the semiconductor divisions of Radiation Incorporated, [[General Electric]] and [[RCA]] they had taken over before.

In 1999 Harris spun off its entire semiconductor division and Intersil Corporation was created &lt;ref&gt;http://harris.com/view_pressrelease.asp?pr_id=483&lt;/ref&gt; with the largest IPO in American semiconductor industry history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intersil.eefocus.com/article/09-09/9061301100901gxDG.html Intersil庆祝成立10周年] {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second Intersil Corporation is a different company from the original Intersil, Inc.

Next to digital circuits like microprocessors and memories like the 1k-bit CMOS RAM IM6508 and CMOS EPROMS IM6604/IM6654 Intersil designed famous analogue ICs like the [[8038 ic|ICM8038]] waveform generator. A creation of Intersil (as Harris Semiconductor) is the [[PRISM (chipset)|PRISM]] line of [[Wi-Fi]] hardware: that group of products was sold to [[GlobespanVirata]] in 2003, and maintained by [[Conexant]]. Intersil is the manufacturer of the [[RCA 1802|RCA (CDP)1802]] [[microprocessor]] (also known as RCA COSMAC),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpushack.com/2010/09/04/from-video-games-to-deep-space-the-rca-1802-cosmac/&lt;/ref&gt; a [[central processing unit|CPU]] traditionally used in space applications.

In the 2000s, Intersil established market leadership in Vcore{{Clarify|date=October 2016}} power management for PCs, switching and buck boost regulators for industrial and consumer power systems, and radiation hardened analog and power ICs for military and commercial applications.

The company, under CEO Dave Bell,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/intersil-ceo-beyer-resigns-david-bell-named-as-new-ceo?dateid=39491.6787733681-921564050&lt;/ref&gt; then began the expansion of a catalog analog business. The company also completed a series of acquisitions, two of which are still part of the portfolio, Zilker Labs&lt;ref&gt;http://powerelectronics.com/content/intersil-acquires-zilker-labs&lt;/ref&gt; digital power devices and Techwell&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/intersil-ceo-holds-steady-on-analogue-strategy-2008-10/&lt;/ref&gt; automotive and security and surveillance products.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ay_ogRXA2ufM&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, with revenue in decline, the company's board of directors removed Dave Bell&lt;ref name="intersil.presscentre.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intersil.presscentre.com/Press-releases/Intersil-Announces-Resignation-of-Dave-Bell-as-President-CEO-9ef.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140314191309/http://intersil.presscentre.com/Press-releases/Intersil-Announces-Resignation-of-Dave-Bell-as-President-CEO-9ef.aspx |archivedate=2014-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and began a search for a new CEO.  In March 2013, the board appointed Necip Sayiner,&lt;ref name="intersil.presscentre.com"/&gt; the architect of Silicon Labs' turnaround, as CEO.  Sayiner concentrated the company's efforts on power management and select target markets.  The company was able to return to profitability&lt;ref&gt;http://intersil.presscentre.com/imagelibrary/downloadmedia.ashx?MediaDetailsID=121&amp;SizeId=-1{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013 and in early 2014 re-launched  as a power management company, with products to improve power efficiency, extend battery life and reduce size.

Japanese semiconductor company [[Renesas]] acquired Intersil on February 24, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Renesas and Intersil Announce Final Regulatory Approval for Renesas’ Acquisition of Intersil |date= February 22, 2017 |work= Press release |publisher= Renesas |url= https://www.renesas.com/en-us/about/press-center/news/2017/news20170222.html |access-date= April 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lens cover''' or '''lens cap''' provides protection from scratches and minor collisions for [[camera]] and [[camcorder]] [[photographic lens|lenses]]. Lens covers come standard with most cameras and lenses. Some mobile [[camera phone]]s include lens covers, such as the [[Sony Ericsson W800]], the [[Sony Ericsson K750]] and the [[Sony Ericsson K550]].

A more secure lens cap is the metal screw-in lens cap which cannot pop off a lens accidentally.  Although a screw-in cap takes more time to remove in order to take a photograph than a standard lens cap, it is stronger than plastic and therefore more protective.

'''''Nanobama''''' is the name of microminiature portraits of [[United States]] President [[Barack Obama]].

To celebrate the election of Obama and to draw attention to the growing capabilities of [[nanotechnology]], Professor John Hart of [[University of Michigan]]'s Mechanical Engineering department created the world's smallest presidential portrait, measuring 500 μm across (about the size of a period in the average printed text).

The portrait is composed of some 150 million [[carbon nanotube]]s.  Hart actually created the portraits before the election's outcome was known, and he let the secret out to the world in early November 2008.

There are several ''Nanobamas'' extant, but they all reside on a [[silicon wafer]] in the professor's office.

'''Nanomechanics''' is a branch of ''[[nanoscience]]'' studying fundamental ''mechanical'' (elastic, thermal and kinetic) properties of physical systems at the [[nanometer]] scale. Nanomechanics has emerged on the crossroads of [[classical mechanics]], [[solid-state physics]], [[statistical mechanics]], [[materials science]], and [[quantum chemistry]]. As an area of nanoscience, nanomechanics provides a scientific foundation of [[nanotechnology]]. 

Nanomechanics is that branch of nanoscience which deals with the study and application of fundamental [[List of materials properties#Mechanical properties|mechanical properties]] of physical systems at the nanoscale, such as elastic, thermal and kinetic material properties.

Often, nanomechanics is viewed as a ''branch'' of [[nanotechnology]], i.e., an applied area with a focus on the mechanical properties of ''engineered'' [[nanostructures]] and nanosystems (systems with nanoscale components of importance). Examples of the latter include [[nanoparticles]], nanopowders, [[nanowires]], [[nanorods]], nanoribbons, [[Carbon nanotube|nanotubes]], including [[carbon nanotubes]] (CNT) and [[boron nitride]] nanotubes (BNNTs); [[nanoshells]], nanomebranes, nanocoatings, [[nanocomposite]]/nanostructured materials, (fluids with dispersed nanoparticles); [[nanomotor]]s, etc.

Some of the well-established ''fields of nanomechanics'' are: [[nanomaterials]], [[nanotribology]] ([[friction]], [[wear]] and [[contact mechanics]] at the [[nanoscale]]), [[nanoelectromechanical systems]] (NEMS), and [[nanofluidics]].  

As a fundamental science, nanomechanics is based on some [[empirical]] principles (basic observations), namely general mechanics principles and specific principles arising from the smallness of physical sizes of the object of study.

General mechanics principles include:

* [[Energy]] and [[momentum]] conservation principles 
* Variational [[Hamilton's principle]]
* [[Symmetry]] principles

Due to smallness of the studied object, nanomechanics also accounts for:

* ''Discreteness'' of the object, whose size is comparable with the interatomic distances  
* Plurality, but ''finiteness'', of [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] in the object
* Importance of ''[[thermal fluctuations]]'' 
* Importance of ''entropic effects'' (see [[configuration entropy]])
* Importance of ''[[quantum]] effects'' (see [[quantum machine]])

These principles serve to provide a basic insight into novel mechanical properties of nanometer objects. Novelty is understood in the sense that these properties are not present in similar macroscale objects or much different from the properties of those (e.g., nanorods vs. usual macroscopic beam structures). In particular, smallness of the subject itself gives rise to various surface effects determined by higher surface-to-volume ratio of [[nanostructures]], and thus affects mechanoenergetic and thermal properties (melting point, heat capacitance, etc.) of [[nanostructures]]. Discreteness serves a fundamental reason, for instance, for the dispersion of mechanical [[wave|waves]] in [[solids]], and some special behavior of basic elastomechanics solutions at small scales. Plurality of degrees of freedom and the rise of thermal fluctuations are the reasons for thermal [[Quantum tunneling|tunneling]] of [[nanoparticles]] through [[potential]] barriers, as well as for the cross-[[diffusion]] of [[liquids]] and [[solids]]. Smallness and thermal fluctuations provide the basic reasons of the [[Brownian motion]] of nanoparticles. Increased importance of thermal fluctuations and configuration [[entropy]] at the [[nanoscale]] give rise to [[superelasticity]], entropic elasticity ([[entropic forces]]), and other exotic types of [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of [[nanostructures]]. Aspects of configuration entropy are also of great interest in the context [[self-organization]] and cooperative behavior of open nanosystems.        

Quantum effects determine ''[[forces]] of interaction'' between individual [[atoms]] in physical objects, which are introduced in nanomechanics by means of some averaged [[mathematical models]] called ''[[interatomic potentials]]''. 

Subsequent utilization of the [[interatomic potential]]s within the classical [[multibody]] [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] provide [[deterministic]] mechanical models of nano structures and systems at the atomic scale/resolution. [[Numerical methods]] of solution of these models are called ''[[molecular dynamics]]'' (MD), and sometimes ''[[molecular mechanics]]'' (especially, in relation to statically equilibrated (still) models). Non-deterministic numerical approaches include [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]], Kinetic More-Carlo (KMC), and other methods. Contemporary numerical tools include also hybrid ''multiscale approaches''  allowing concurrent or sequential utilization of the atomistic scale methods (usually, MD) with the continuum (macro) scale methods (usually, [[field emission microscopy]]) within a single mathematical model. Development of these complex methods is a separate subject of [[applied mechanics]] research. 

Quantum effects also determine novel electrical, optical and chemical properties of [[nanostructures]], and therefore they find even greater attention in adjacent areas of [[nanoscience]] and [[nanotechnology]], such as [[nanoelectronics]], advanced energy systems, and [[nanobiotechnology]].

'''Nanorobotics''' is an [[emerging technology]] field creating machines or [[robot]]s whose components are at or near the scale of a [[nanometre]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; meters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Vaughn JR |title= Over the Horizon: Potential Impact of Emerging Trends in Information and Communication Technology on Disability Policy and Practice |journal=National Council on Disability, Washington DC |pages=1–55 |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ghosh, A.|author2= Fischer, P. |title= Controlled Propulsion of Artificial Magnetic Nanostructured Propellers |journal= Nano Letters |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=2243–2245 |date=2009 |doi=10.1021/nl900186w |pmid= 19413293|bibcode= 2009NanoL...9.2243G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sierra, D.

Nanomachines are largely in the [[research and development]] phase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wang, J. |title=Can Man-Made Nanomachines Compete with Nature Biomotors? |journal= ACS Nano |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=4–9 |date=2009 |doi=10.1021/nn800829k |pmid=19206241}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some primitive [[molecular machine]]s and [[nanomotor]]s have been tested. An example is a sensor having a switch approximately 1.5 nanometers across, able to count specific molecules in a chemical sample. The first useful applications of nanomachines may be in [[nanomedicine]].  For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1002/ange.200905200 |title= Targeted Optimization of a Protein Nanomachine for Operation in Biohybrid Devices |journal= Angewandte Chemie |volume= 122 |issue= 2 |pages= 322–326 |year= 2010 |last1= Amrute-Nayak |first1= M. |last2= Diensthuber |first2= R.

[[Rice University]] has demonstrated a [[Nanocar|single-molecule car]] developed by a chemical process and including [[Buckminsterfullerene]]s (buckyballs) for wheels. It is actuated by controlling the environmental temperature and by positioning a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] tip.
[[Image:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px| A [[ribosome]] is a [[biological machine]].]]
Another definition is a robot that allows precise interactions with nanoscale objects, or can manipulate with nanoscale resolution. Such devices are more related to [[microscopy]] or [[scanning probe microscopy]], instead of the description of nanorobots as [[molecular machine]]. Using the microscopy definition, even a large apparatus such as an [[atomic force microscope]] can be considered a nanorobotic instrument when configured to perform nanomanipulation. For this viewpoint, macroscale robots or microrobots that can move with nanoscale precision can also be considered nanorobots.

==Nanorobotics theory==
According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see [[nanomachine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "''[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the surgeon]]''". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since nanorobots would be microscopic in size, it would probably be necessary for very large numbers of them to work together to perform microscopic and macroscopic tasks. These nanorobot swarms, both those unable to [[Self-replicating machine|replicate]] (as in [[utility fog]]) and those able to replicate unconstrainedly in the natural environment (as in [[grey goo]] and its less common variants, such as [[synthetic biology]] or [[utility fog]]), are found in many science fiction stories, such as the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] [[Nanoprobe (Star Trek)|nanoprobes]] in ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' episode "[[The New Breed (The Outer Limits)|The New Breed]]".

Some proponents of nanorobotics, in reaction to the [[grey goo]] scenarios that they earlier helped to propagate, hold the view that nanorobots able to replicate outside of a restricted factory environment do not form a necessary part of a purported productive nanotechnology, and that the process of self-replication, were it ever to be developed, could be made inherently safe. They further assert that their current plans for developing and using molecular manufacturing do not in fact include free-foraging replicators.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/selfRep.html Zyvex: "Self replication and nanotechnology"]
"artificial self replicating systems will only function in carefully controlled artificial environments
...
While self replicating systems are the key to low cost, there is no need (and little desire) to have such systems function in the outside world. Instead, in an artificial and controlled environment, they can manufacture simpler and more rugged systems that can then be transferred to their final destination. ... The resulting medical device will be simpler, smaller, more efficient and more precisely designed for the task at hand than a device designed to perform the same function and self replicate. ... A single device able to do [both] would be harder to design and less efficient."
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/ "Foresight Guidelines for Responsible Nanotechnology Development"]
"Autonomous self-replicating assemblers are not necessary to achieve significant manufacturing capabilities."
"The simplest, most efficient, and safest approach to productive nanosystems is to make specialized nanoscale tools and put them together in factories big enough to make what is needed. ... The machines in this would work like the conveyor belts and assembly robots in a factory, doing similar jobs. If you pulled one of these machines out of the system, it would pose no risk, and be as inert as a light bulb pulled from its socket."
&lt;/ref&gt;

The most detailed theoretical discussion of nanorobotics, including specific design issues such as sensing, power communication, navigation, manipulation, locomotion, and onboard computation, has been presented in the medical context of [[nanomedicine]] by [[Robert Freitas]].&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Freitas Jr., Nanomedicine, Vol. I: Basic Capabilities, Landes Bioscience, Georgetown TX, 1999; http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI.htm. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Freitas Jr., Nanomedicine, Vol. IIA: Biocompatibility, Landes Bioscience, Georgetown TX, 2003; http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMIIA.htm. &lt;/ref&gt; Some of these discussions remain at the level of unbuildable generality and do not approach the level of detailed engineering.

==Legal and ethical implications==

===Open technology===
A document with a proposal on nanobiotech development using [[open design]] technology methods, as in [[open-source hardware]] and [[open-source software]], has been addressed to the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cavalcanti, A. |title=Nanorobot Invention and Linux: The Open Technology Factor – An Open Letter to UNO General Secretary |journal= CANNXS Project |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |date=2009 |url=http://www.cannxs.org/open.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the document sent to the [[United Nations]], in the same way that [[open source]] has in recent years accelerated the development of [[computer]] systems, a similar approach should benefit the society at large and accelerate nanorobotics development. The use of [[nanobiotechnology]] should be established as a human heritage for the coming generations, and developed as an open technology based on [[ethical]] practices for [[peace]]ful purposes. Open technology is stated as a fundamental key for such an aim.

===Nanorobot race===
In the same ways that technology [[research and development]] drove the [[space race]] and [[nuclear arms race]], a race for nanorobots is occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi= 10.4103/0973-1482.29829 |title= "Nano": The new nemesis of cancer |journal= Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics |volume= 2 |issue= 4 |pages= 186–95 |year= 2006 |last1= Huilgol |first1= N. |last2= Hede |first2= S. |pmid=17998702}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1109/TCSI.2007.907864 |title= Designs for Ultra-Tiny, Special-Purpose Nanoelectronic Circuits |journal= IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers |volume= 54 |issue= 11 |pages= 2528–2540 |year= 2007 |last1= Das |first1= S. |last2= Gates |first2= A.

==Manufacturing approaches==

Manufacturing nanomachines assembled from molecular components is a very challenging task. Because of the level of difficulty, many engineers and scientists continue working cooperatively across multidisciplinary approaches to achieve breakthroughs in this new area of development. Thus, it is quite understandable the importance of the following distinct techniques currently applied towards manufacturing nanorobots:

===Biochip===
{{Main|Biochip}}
The joint use of [[nanoelectronics]], [[photolithography]], and new [[biomaterial]]s provides a possible approach to manufacturing nanorobots for common medical uses, such as surgical instrumentation, diagnosis, and drug delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fisher, B. |title=Biological Research in the Evolution of Cancer Surgery: A Personal Perspective |journal= Cancer Research |volume=68 |issue=24 |pages=10007–10020 |date=2008 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0186 |pmid=19074862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi= 10.3390/s8052932 |pmid= 27879858 |pmc= 3675524 |title= Nanorobot Hardware Architecture for Medical Defense |journal= Sensors |volume= 8 |issue= 5 |pages= 2932–2958 |year= 2008 |last1= Cavalcanti |first1= A. |last2= Shirinzadeh |first2= B. |last3= Zhang |first3= M. |last4= Kretly |first4= L.

The surface anchored motors could potentially be used to move and position nanoscale materials on a surface in the manner of a conveyor belt.

===Positional nanoassembly===
Nanofactory Collaboration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory "Nanofactory Collaboration"]. ''molecularassembler.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Robert Freitas]] and [[Ralph Merkle]] in 2000 and involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries, focuses on developing a practical research agenda&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/Challenges.htm "Nanofactory Technical Challenges"]. ''molecularassembler.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; specifically aimed at developing positionally-controlled diamond [[mechanosynthesis]] and a [[diamondoid]] nanofactory that would have the capability of building diamondoid medical nanorobots.

===Biohybrids===
The emerging field of bio-hybrid systems combines biological and synthetic structural elements for biomedical or robotic applications. The constituting elements of bio-nanoelectromechanical systems (BioNEMS) are of nanoscale size, for example DNA, proteins or nanostructured mechanical parts. Thiol-ene ebeam resist allow the direct writing of nanoscale features, followed by the functionalization of the natively reactive resist surface with biomolecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shafagh|first=Reza|last2=Vastesson|first2=Alexander|last3=Guo|first3=Weijin|last4=van der Wijngaart|first4=Wouter|last5=Haraldsson|first5=Tommy|year=2018|title=E-Beam Nanostructuring and Direct Click Biofunctionalization of Thiol–Ene Resist|journal=ACS Nano|language=en|doi=10.1021/acsnano.8b03709|pmid=30212184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other approaches use a biodegradable material attached to magnetic particles that allow them to be guided around the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/2/12/eaaq1155 Multifunctional biohybrid magnetite microrobots for imaging-guided therapy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virus-based===
[[Retrovirus]]es can be retrained to attach to [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and replace [[DNA]].

[http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/101/motm.do?momID=33 "RCSB PDB-101"]. ''rcsb.org''.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, these devices are Pol – Gag [[gene]]s of the [[virus]] for the [[Capsid]] and Delivery system.

===3D printing===
{{Main|3D printing}}

3D printing is the process by which a three-dimensional structure is built through the various processes of additive manufacturing. Nanoscale 3D printing involves many of the same process, incorporated at a much smaller scale. To print a structure in the 5-400&amp;nbsp;µm scale, the precision of the 3D printing machine is improved greatly. A two-steps process of 3D printing, using a 3D printing and laser etched plates method was incorporated as an improvement technique.&lt;ref name="nanoseoul"&gt;{{Citation|title=Nano Robot by 3D Printing (Seoul National University, Korea).wmv |date=2012-01-29 |accessdate=2015-12-04 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4IavKUzK2c}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be more precise at a nanoscale, the 3D printing process uses a laser etching machine, which etches into each plate the details needed for the segment of nanorobot. The plate is then transferred to the 3D printer, which fills the etched regions with the desired nanoparticle. The 3D printing process is repeated until the nanorobot is built from the bottom up. This 3D printing process has many benefits. First, it increases the overall accuracy of the printing process.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Second, it has the potential to create functional segments of a nanorobot.&lt;ref name="nanoseoul" /&gt; The 3D printer uses a liquid resin, which is hardened at precisely the correct spots by a focused laser beam. The focal point of the laser beam is guided through the resin by movable mirrors and leaves behind a hardened line of solid polymer, just a few hundred nanometers wide. This fine resolution enables the creation of intricately structured sculptures as tiny as a grain of sand. This process takes place by using photoactive resins, which are hardened by the laser at an extremely small scale to create the structure. This process is quick by nanoscale 3D printing standards. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. This approach uses a focused laser to trace the desired 3D object into a block of gel. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100&amp;nbsp;nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Nanotechnology and 3D-printing|url= http://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/spotid=37541.php|website= www.nanowerk.com|accessdate= 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In such plans, future [[medical nanotechnology]] is expected to employ nanorobots injected into the patient to perform work at a cellular level. Such nanorobots intended for use in medicine should be non-replicating, as replication would needlessly increase device complexity, reduce reliability, and interfere with the medical mission.

Nanotechnology provides a wide range of new technologies for developing customized means to optimize the delivery of [[pharmaceutical drug]]s. Today, harmful side effects of treatments such as [[chemotherapy]] are commonly a result of drug delivery methods that don't pinpoint their intended target cells accurately.&lt;ref name=Debjit/&gt; Researchers at [[Harvard]] and [[MIT]], however, have been able to attach special [[RNA]] strands, measuring nearly 10&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter, to nanoparticles, filling them with a chemotherapy drug. These RNA strands are attracted to [[cancer cell]]s. When the nanoparticle encounters a cancer cell, it adheres to it, and releases the drug into the cancer cell.&lt;ref&gt;Bullis, Kevin (April 29, 2008). [http://www.technologyreview.com/news/410047/nano-rna-delivery/ "Nano RNA Delivery."] ''MIT Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; This directed method of drug delivery has great potential for treating cancer patients while avoiding negative effects (commonly associated with improper drug delivery).&lt;ref name=Debjit&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology|volume=1|issue=1|date=2009|pages=20–35|author=Bhowmik, Debjit|title=Role of Nanotechnology in novel Drug Delivery system|url=http://www.onlinepharmacytech.info/docs/JPST09-01-01-03.pdf|access-date=2015-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924060506/http://www.onlinepharmacytech.info/docs/JPST09-01-01-03.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1039/C4NR03124E |pmid= 25096021 |title= Synthetic micro/nanomotors in drug delivery |journal= Nanoscale |volume= 6 |issue= 18 |pages= 10486–94 |year= 2014 |last1= Gao |first1= W. |last2= Wang |first2= J. |bibcode= 2014Nanos...610486G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first demonstration of nanomotors operating in living organism was carried out in 2014 at University of California, San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1021/nn507097k |pmid= 25549040 |pmc= 4310033 |title= Artificial Micromotors in the Mouse's Stomach: A Step towardin Vivo ''Use'' of Synthetic Motors |journal= ACS Nano |volume= 9 |issue= 1 |pages= 117–23 |year= 2015 |last1= Gao |first1= W. |last2= Dong |first2= R. |last3= Thamphiwatana |first3= S. |last4= Li |first4= J. |last5= Gao |first5= W. |last6= Zhang |first6= L. |last7= Wang |first7= J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; MRI-guided [[nanocapsule]]s are one potential precursor to nanorobots.&lt;ref name="Vartholomeos et al 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071910-124724 |pmid=21529162 |title=MRI-Guided Nanorobotic Systems for Therapeutic and Diagnostic Applications |year=2011 |last1=Vartholomeos |first1=P. |last2=Fruchard |first2=M. |last3=Ferreira |first3=A. |last4=Mavroidis |first4=C. |journal=Annu Rev Biomed Eng|volume=13 |pages=157–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another useful application of nanorobots is assisting in the repair of tissue cells alongside [[white blood cell]]s.&lt;ref name="nanorobotdesign.com"&gt;Casal, Arancha ''et al.'' (2004) [http://www.nanorobotdesign.com/papers/nanoroboticsBCATS2003.pdf "Nanorobots As Cellular Assistants in Inflammatory Responses"]. nanorobotdesign.com&lt;/ref&gt; Recruiting inflammatory cells or white blood cells (which include [[neutrophil granulocyte]]s, [[lymphocyte]]s, [[monocyte]]s, and [[mast cell]]s) to the affected area is the first response of tissues to injury.&lt;ref&gt;C. Janeway (ed.) (2001) ''ImmunoBiology, the Immune System in Health and Disease''. Garland Pub; 5th ed. {{ISBN|0-8153-3642-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their small size, nanorobots could attach themselves to the surface of recruited white cells, to squeeze their way out through the walls of [[blood vessel]]s and arrive at the injury site, where they can assist in the tissue repair process. Certain substances could possibly be used to accelerate the recovery.

The science behind this mechanism is quite complex. Passage of cells across the blood [[endothelium]], a process known as transmigration, is a mechanism involving engagement of cell surface receptors to adhesion molecules, active force exertion and [[Vasodilation|dilation]] of the vessel walls and physical deformation of the migrating cells. By attaching themselves to migrating [[inflammation|inflammatory]] cells, the robots can in effect “hitch a ride” across the blood vessels, bypassing the need for a complex transmigration mechanism of their own.&lt;ref name="nanorobotdesign.com"/&gt;

{{As of|2016}}, in the United States, [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates [[nanotechnology]] on the basis of size.&lt;ref&gt;FDA (2011) [http://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm257698.htm Considering Whether an FDA-Regulated Product Involves the Application of Nanotechnology, Guidance for Industry, Draft Guidance].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
The synthesis technology used by OCSiAl for graphene nanotubes (also known as single wall carbon nanotubes – [[SWCNT]]) is based on research by one of the company’s founders, Mikhail Predtechensky, OCSiAl’s Chief Technology Officer and a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sites.ieee.org/sfbanano/2014/04/24/low-cost-scalable-production-and-applications-of-single-walled-carbon-nanotubes/|title=Low-cost scalable production and applications of single-walled carbon nanotubes «  SF Bay Area Nanotechnology Council|website=sites.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://content.yudu.com/web/1rl19/0A1rl2p/CWFeb18/flash/resources/42.htm|title=Compounding World Feb 18|website=content.yudu.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology is notable for producing SWCNT in tonnes to enable low enough pricing for industrial applications to become economically feasible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The company’s initial synthesis facility, named Graphetron 1.0, was built at the company’s scientific and prototyping center in [[Akademgorodok]], Novosibirsk.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.packagingeurope.com/Packaging-Europe-News/70495/The-Affordable-Nanotech-Revolution.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 output was estimated at 1 tonne, with a capacity of 10 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compositesworld.com/news/ocsial-launches-carbon-nanotube-modifier-product-line|title=OCSiAl launches carbon nanotube modifier product line: CompositesWorld|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 OCSiAl noted plans to reach 60 tonnes&lt;ref name="nanotechmag.com"&gt;https://www.nanotechmag.com/high-yield-technology-synthesis-high-purity-tuball-single-wall-carbon-nanotubes-nano-tech-2017-japan/{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; of production capacity by commissioning a second facility for nanotube synthesis, known as Graphetron 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.packagingeurope.com/Magazine/Show_Edition/#165/z|title=The World of European Packaging|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2020 the company will increase its capacity to 310 tonnes by setting up the world’s largest production facility in Luxembourg. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://luxtimes.lu/archives/1545-world-s-largest-nanotube-production-facility-to-be-set-up-in-luxembourg|title=Luxembourg Times - Archives - World's largest nanotube production facility to be set up in Luxembourg|website=luxtimes.lu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In December 2014 [[Frost &amp; Sullivan]] recognized the OCSiAl Group with its 2014 North American Award for Technology Innovation for OCSiAl’s TUBALL SWCNT products.&lt;ref&gt;https://ww2.frost.com/news/press-releases/ocsial-group-receives-frost-sullivan-technology-innovation-award-its-game-changing-carbon-nanotube-production-process&lt;/ref&gt; The award was given for the high purity and large-scale production capability of TUBALL products, which has significantly increased the commercialization potential of single wall carbon nanotube products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcimag.com/articles/99935-ocsial-group-receives-frost-sullivan-technology-innovation-award|title=OCSiAl Group Receives Frost &amp; Sullivan Technology Innovation Award|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), a United States government program to accelerate nanotechnology commercialization, recognized OCSiAl for expanding its matching grant program (iNanoComm) for exploratory research with SWCNT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/05/20/new-initiatives-accelerate-commercialization-nanotechnology|title=New Initiatives to Accelerate the Commercialization of Nanotechnology|date=20 May 2015|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, OCSiAl registered its core product TUBALL through the EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation under the number 01-2120130006-75-0000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.envigo.com/press-news/2016/envigo-collaboration-with-ocsial-and-intertek.aspx|title=Envigo collaboration with OCSiAl and InterTek results in single wall carbon nanotubes completing REACH registration for the first time ever - Envigo|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2016 OCSiAl is the only company with the license toproduce and commercialize up to 10 tonnes of nanotubes in Europe annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compositesworld.com/news/single-wall-carbon-nanotubes-complete-reach-registration|title=Single-wall carbon nanotubes complete REACH registration: CompositesWorld|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
The company’s core product is TUBALL, high-purity graphene nanotubes that can be used as a universal additive for a wide range of materials.&lt;ref name="nanotechmag.com"/&gt; Graphene nanotube is an extremely thin rolled-up sheet of graphene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-06-01|title=Carbon nanotube in different shapes|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702109701762|journal=Materials Today|language=en|volume=12|issue=6|pages=12–18|doi=10.1016/S1369-7021(09)70176-2|issn=1369-7021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key advantage of graphene nanotubes centers around the very low loadings, starting at 0.01%, that are sufficient for achieving uniform and permanent conductivity while also reinforcing mechanical properties.&lt;ref name="specchemonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specchemonline.com/news/a-huge-future-for-tiny-tubes|title=A huge future for tiny tubes|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The very low loadings made possible by SWCNT provide the ability to maintain the original color and minimally impact secondary properties of most materials.&lt;ref name="specchemonline.com"/&gt;

OCSiAl has also developed nanotube-based concentrates that simplify graphene nanotubes use in various materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.yudu.com/web/1rl19/0A1rl2p/CWOct16/html/index.html?page=34|title=Compounding World Oct 16|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the company opened a research facility focused on nanotubes applications for batteries, elastomers, paints and coatings, thermoplastic, and thermoset materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rubberasia.com/2017/01/13/swcnts-revolutionary-additives/|title=SWCNTs: Revolutionary additives|date=13 January 2017|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Elastomer applications===
TUBALL-based masterbatches use rubber polymers, fillers and oil plasticizers as nanotube carriers, allowing performance improvements with minimal changes to the composition of a rubber compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rubberasia.com/2017/01/13/swcnts-revolutionary-additives/|title=SWCNTs: Revolutionary additives|date=13 January 2017|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016 LANXESS and OCSiAl announced new nanotubes products targeting reinforced and conductive latex rubbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polymer-additives.specialchem.com/news/product-news/cnt-conductive-additives-lanxess-ocsial-k2016-000184159|title=CNT-based Conductive Additives - LANXESS &amp; OCSiAl at K 2016|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy storage applications===
TUBALL nanotubes bring performance improvements to Li-ion and lead–acid batteries, and to supercapacitors and fuel cells.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.batteriesinternational.com/carbon-nanotubes-create-spectacular-improvement-in-lead-acid-batteries/&lt;/ref&gt; In these applications SWCNT has the potential to replace carbon black and other carbon-based additives, with a study by Aleees demonstrating 10% higher volumetric energy density and decreasing cathode thickness by 18% in 10 Ah pouch cells.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ees-magazine.com/a-step-forward-in-the-evolution-of-battery-energy-density/&lt;/ref&gt; In another study by Aleees, SWCNT-coated foils showed an increase in energy delivered to cells by 0-252%, depending on the discharge rate. In trials of lead-acid batteries 0.001% of SWCNT in the electrode paste increased cycle life and rate capability five-fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279178145_SWCNT_vs_MWCNT_and_Nanofibers_Applications_in_Lithium-Ion_Batteries_and_Transparent_Conductive_Films|title=SWCNT vs MWCNT and Nanofibers. Applications in Lithium-Ion Batteries and Transparent Conductive Films (PDF Download Available)|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paints &amp; coatings applications===
TUBALL nanotubes provide conductivity to colored and transparent coatings with minimal impact on color or transparency, while maintaining or increasing mechanical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coatingsworld.com/contents/view_live-from-shows/2016-12-12/ocsial-moves-beyond-regular-conductivity-in-coatings-with-single-wall-carbon-nanotubes/|title=OCSiAl Moves Beyond Regular Conductivity in Coatings with Single Wall Carbon Nanotubes|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conductivity may be employed for ESD-control properties or electrostatic painting methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coatingsworld.com/issues/2017-01-01/view_russian-report/single-wall-carbon-nanotubes-looks-promising-for-global-coating-industry/|title=Single Wall Carbon Nanotubes Looks Promising for Global Coating Industry|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resins &amp; composites applications===
In November 2016 OCSiAl announced an agreement with BÜFA Composite Systems in Europe to provide TUBALL nanotubes and TUBALL MATRIX nanotube concentrates for BÜFA-developed resin formulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polymer-additives.specialchem.com/news/industry-news/nanotubebased-modifiers-production-000184727|title=BÜFA &amp; OCSiAl Sign MoU for Nanotube-based Modifiers|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 BÜFA hit the market with its line of conductive gelcoats with colored, smooth and glossy surfaces. There are some particular applications where nanotube-based gelcoats can almost completely replace standard gelcoats. Pipes and tanks for chemicals, ventilation systems, printing rollers, control boxes for electronics, floor coatings at industrial production plants, tooling gelcoats and resins for composites, to name just a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.coatingsworld.com/contents/view_breaking-news/2018-04-06/ocsial-bufa-develop-tuball-nanotubes|title=OCSiAl, BÜFA Develop TUBALL Nanotubes|work=Coatings World|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The companies noted that using graphene nanotubes in composites provides a conductive and reinforcing network at low loadings, enabling conductive parts to retain color and improve mechanical strength.

'''Pitometer logs''' (also known as pit logs) are devices used to measure a ship's speed relative to the water. They are used on both surface ships and submarines. Data from the pitometer log is usually fed directly into the ship's navigation system.

==History==

All nautical instruments designed to measure the speed of a ship through water are known as logs.
&lt;ref name="logs"&gt;

This nomenclature dates back to days of sail when sailors tossed a log attached to rope knotted at regular intervals off the stern of a ship. The sailors would count the number of knots that passed through their hands in a given period of time. Today sailors still use the unit of [[knot (unit)|knots]] to express a ship's speed. The speed of the ship was needed to navigate the ship using [[dead reckoning]], which was standard practice in the days before modern [[navigation]] instruments like [[GPS]].

During World War II, pitometer logs were often interfaced directly into warship [[Fire-control system|fire control]] systems. This interface was necessary to allow gunnery and [[Torpedo Data Computer|torpedo fire control systems]] to automatically track targets.

The pitometer log was patented&lt;ref name="patented"&gt;

==Technology==

===Principles of operation===
[[Image:Manometer.png|noframe|thumb|Figure 2: Illustration of a Mercury Manometer-Based Pitometer Log.]]
The basic technology of the pitometer log is similar to that of the [[pitot tube]] on an aircraft. Typically, the pitometer has a long tube that penetrates the ship's hull near the keel. The part of the pitometer protruding from the ship is sometimes called a [[pit sword]] or [[rodmeter]]. This tube usually has two openings: one facing the direction of seawater motion that is used to measure the dynamic pressure of the seawater and one at 90° to the direction of seawater motion that is used to measure the static seawater pressure. The dynamic pressure of the seawater is a function of the depth of the water and the speed of the vessel.

In early realizations of the pitometer log, mercury manometers
&lt;ref name = "mercury"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
were used to measure the pressure differences (see Figure 1).&lt;ref name="patented"/&gt; Later realizations used approaches that would generate equalizing pressures within the pitometer that would balance out the dynamic pressure. This eliminated the need for mercury manometers.

===Analysis===

An expression can be derived for the velocity of water impacting the ship as a function of the difference in dynamic and static water pressure using [[Bernoulli's principle]]. The total pressure of the water in the tube with moving seawater can be described by Equation 1.

{|
|-
!width="150pt" align="left"| (Equation 1)
!width="225pt" align="left"|&lt;math&gt; p_{Total}= p_{Static} + p_{Dynamic} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

:where
:*''p&lt;sub&gt;Total&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the total fluid pressure.
:*''p&lt;sub&gt;Static&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the static pressure, which strictly depends on depth.
:*''p&lt;sub&gt;Dynamic&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the fluid pressure caused by fluid motion.

Since water is an incompressible fluid, the dynamic pressure component of the total pressure can be expressed in terms of the water density and the water velocity as is shown in Equation 2. 
{|
|-
!width="150pt" align="left"| (Equation 2)
!width="225pt" align="left"|&lt;math&gt; p_{Total}= p_{Static} + \rho \cdot \frac{v_{Water}^2}{2} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

:where
:*''v&lt;sub&gt;Water&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the speed of the fluid flow.
:*''ρ'' is the fluid density.

Equation 2 can be solved for the velocity of water in terms of the difference in pressure between the two legs of the manometer. Equation 3 shows that velocity is a function of the square root of the pressure difference. 
{|
|-
!width="150pt" align="left"| (Equation 3)
!width="225pt" align="left"|&lt;math&gt; v_{Water} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot \left(p_{Total}-p_{Static}\right)}{\rho}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Because the speed computed by the pitometer is a function of the difference between pressure readings, the pitometer does not produce an accurate result when the ship's velocity is low and the two pressure readings are nearly the same.

==Alternatives to the pitometer==
While the pitometer log is very commonly used today, there are a number of other logs that are also in use. These logs include:

:* [[Impeller log]]: A small [[propeller]] mounted in the water that passes by the ship hull. The rotation rate of the propeller is proportional to the speed of the ship. This device is similar in principle to an [[anemometer]], which is used to measure wind speed. A variation of this approach is known as a patent log, which is towed from the stern of a ship. The patent log includes a mechanical register that counts the log's rotations as it is being towed. The patent log was invented in 1688 by the English instrument maker [[Humphry Cole]]. The patent log is also known as a screw log or [[taffrail log]].&lt;ref name = "patentlog"&gt;

}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

:* Propeller [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]]: The speed of a ship is roughly proportional to the rotation rate of the propeller. This approach is most useful when the propeller has constant pitch. It is less useful on ships with propellers that have variable-pitch propellers or no propellers (like [[sailing ships]]). A variation of this approach was used by submarines during [[World War II]] to determine the speed of targets. The sonar operator would listen to the sound of a target's propeller and would determine its rotation rate or “blade count”. Knowing the propeller rotation rate and visually identifying the type of ship, the target's speed could be estimated.

:* [[GPS]] measurements yield only a position, and neither speed nor direction of movement. However, most GPS receivers can automatically derive velocity and direction from two or more position measurements. The disadvantage of this principle is that changes in speed or direction can only be computed with a delay, and that derived direction becomes inaccurate when the distance travelled between two position measurements drops below or near the [[random error]] of position measurement. To counter this effect, more advanced navigation systems use additional sensors like a compass or an [[inertial navigation system]] to complement GPS.

:* [[Doppler Velocity Log]] (DVL): Some ships are equipped with sonar instruments that can measure the Doppler shift in a sound pulse generated by the ship's motion as it reflects off the ocean bottom or off particles in the water. The speed measurements from a Doppler instrument can therefore be relative to the ground, or to the water.

:* Correlation Velocity Log (CVL): A CVL consists of a sound transmitter and a number of receivers. These very expensive devices measure the ship's ground speed by performing correlation processing between the signals received by the different receivers at different times. This correlation can be related to the distance moved by the ship.&lt;ref name="CVL"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; CVL's are used primarily by ships that need very precise measurement of low speeds, which a pitometer has difficulty measuring accurately.

"'''Profession'''" is a [[novella]] by [[Isaac Asimov]]. The story first appeared in the July 1957 issue of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' and was the lead story in the 1959 collection ''[[Nine Tomorrows]]''.

==Plot ==
The author presents a centralized Earth society of the [[7th millennium|sixty-sixth century]], in which children are educated by almost instantaneous direct computer/brain interface, a process known as ''taping''. This system is similar to the [[Brain-computer interface|BrainCap]], a concept later explored by [[Arthur C. Clarke]]. Besides educating its own people this way, Earth also supplies educated professionals to other planets, the Outworlds.

People in this future society are taught to read at the age of eight and then Educated at the age of eighteen. Each person's professional speciality is dictated by an analysis of his or her brain, with no choices allowed to the subject.  The best of the Educated people compete in professional "Olympics" in the hope of being "bought" by an advanced Outworld. To stay on Earth is almost an admission of failure. 

George Platen is determined to be a Computer Programmer, a profession in demand, and he hopes to qualify for "export" to a top-flight Outworld. On Reading Day, however, concerns are raised about George's ability to be Educated.  On George's Education Day, he is told that his brain is unfit for any form of Education. He is drugged and sent to a House for the Feeble Minded. 

Although not under physical guard, George stays in the House for a year, where the staff tolerates and even encourages his philosophical and intellectual ruminations as a way to pass the time. He is befriended by Omani, who seems to take a personal interest in George's plight.  George then determines to escape, to leave and seek out Dr. Antonelli who told him he was feeble-minded, and confront him. 

George visits the Olympics, which are happening in San Francisco at that time. He meets his friend Armand Trevelyan, who has been Taped as a 'Metallurgist, Nonferrous'.  Trev is excited about his opportunities but performs poorly on the Beeman spectrograph — his Taping was inadequate regarding the new device—and he is forced to take employment on a fourth-rate Outworld.  George, watching Trev bitterly depart, wishes him well. Trev turns and sarcastically asks, "Well, what have you done?" He then shakes George. A passing policeman breaks up the scuffle and asks George for his identity card. His ruse is up, he will be exposed as an Uneducated escapee. 

Suddenly a stranger appears. He gives the policeman his business card and takes possession of George. The stranger introduces himself as Ladislas Ingenescu, Registered Historian. George and Ingenescu enter into a long conversation about history, society, and progress. George impatiently demands, and Ingenescu obtains for him, an interview with a Novian, an Outworlder on Earth to purchase talent. The Outworlder knows Ingenescu personally. He expresses anger at the Registered Historian (why to a Registered Historian, George wonders?) over Earth continually introducing very minor changes to the Tapes — such as the recent addition of the Beeman spectrograph for Metallurgists — necessitating the Outworlds to keep spending money to stay up to date. The Registered Historian introduces George as someone who thinks he may have a better solution. George contends that people can learn in ways other than being Taped, such as by reading books and in discussion with those who already hold the desired knowledge. This baffles the Outworlder, who sees it only as a source of additional expense. He breaks off their conversation. George is dismayed; the Registered Historian offers condolences.

George is returned to the House and discovers the reality: the House is an Institute of Higher Studies. Those people who have the urge and persistence to create, even though they have been told otherwise about their abilities, are sent there to support the advancement of science and civilization. George has always been under constant observation, and it was subtly but deliberately suggested that he escape and seek out the doctor who sent him there. Reflecting on his experiences "outside," George realizes that a man named Beeman would have to have been the inventor of the Beeman spectrograph. Beeman could not have been Tape-educated and still have created the new device. Someone has to program the Tapes that program the Educated, "men and women with capacity for original thought." George's "keepers" in the Institute are revealed as sociologists, psychologists, historians, scientists, and other professionals who also demonstrated an innate capacity for original thought but not the stamina to keep fighting to express it. Their job is to help other determined, innovators like George{{ndash}}a small fraction{{ndash}}to avoid the same fate. The future of society is at stake.

George himself has one final question.  He asks, "Why do they call them Olympics?".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5174">'''Propagation delay''' is the length of time taken for the quantity of interest to reach its destination. It can relate to [[Computer network|networking]], [[electronics]] or [[physics]].

==Networking==
In [[computer network]]s, propagation delay is the amount of time it takes for the head of the signal to travel from the sender to the receiver. It can be computed as the ratio between the link length and the propagation speed over the specific medium.

Propagation delay is equal to ''d / s'' where ''d'' is the distance and ''s'' is the [[wave propagation speed]]. In wireless communication, ''s''=''c'', i.e. the [[speed of light]]. In [[copper wire]], the speed ''s'' generally ranges from .59c to .77c.&lt;ref name="Ethernet propagation delay"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://stason.org/TULARC/networking/lans-ethernet/3-11-What-is-propagation-delay-Ethernet-Physical-Layer.html | title=What is propagation delay?

==Electronics==
[[File:Full-Adder Propagation Delay.svg|thumb|400px|A [[full adder]] has an overall gate delay of 3 [[logic gate]]s from the inputs ''A'' and ''B'' to the carry output ''C''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; shown in red]]

In [[electronics]], [[digital circuit]]s and [[digital electronics]], the propagation delay, or '''gate delay''', is the length of time which starts when the input to a [[logic gate]] becomes stable and valid to change, to the time that the output of that logic gate is stable and valid to change. Often on manufacturers' datasheets this refers to the time required for the output to reach 50% of its final output level when the input changes to 50% of its final input level. Reducing gate delays in [[digital circuit]]s allows them to process data at a faster rate and improve overall performance. The determination of the propagation delay of a combined circuit requires identifying the longest path of propagation delays from input to output and by adding each tpd time along this path.

The difference in propagation delays of logic elements is the major contributor to [[glitch]]es in [[asynchronous circuit]]s as a result of [[race condition]]s.

The [[principle of logical effort]] utilizes propagation delays to compare designs implementing the same logical statement.

Propagation delay increases with [[operating temperature]], as resistance of conductive materials tends to increase with temperature.  Marginal increases in supply voltage can increase propagation delay since the upper switching threshold voltage, V&lt;sub&gt;IH&lt;/sub&gt; (often expressed as a percentage of the high-voltage supply rail), naturally increases proportionately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Logic Signal Voltage Levels|url=http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/digital/chpt-3/logic-signal-voltage-levels/|website=All About Circuits|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increases in output load capacitance, often from placing increased fan-out loads on a wire, will also increase propagation delay. All of these factors influence each other through an [[RC time constant]]: any increase in load capacitance increases C, heat-induced resistance the R factor, and supply threshold voltage increases will affect whether more than one time constants are required to reach the threshold.  If the output of a logic gate is connected to a long trace or used to drive many other gates (high [[fanout]]) the propagation delay increases substantially.

Wires have an approximate propagation delay of 1 ns for every {{convert|6|in|cm}} of length.&lt;ref name='Complete digital design'&gt;{{Cite book | last = Balch | first = Mark | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Mcgraw Hill - Complete Digital Design A Comprehensive Guide To Digital Electronics And Computer System Architecture | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | year = 2003 | location = | pages = 430 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uFSRT-OIxyoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-07-140927-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Logic gates can have propagation delays ranging from more than 10 ns down to the picosecond range, depending on the technology being used.&lt;ref name='Complete digital design'/&gt;

==Physics==
In [[physics]], particularly in the [[electromagnetic]] field, the propagation delay is the length of time it takes for a signal to travel to its destination. For example, in the case of an electric signal, it is the time taken for the signal to travel through a wire. See also, [[velocity factor]].

"'''Rapid construction''' is a systematic approach to deliver of one kind project with complexity in [[construction]] due to limited time schedule, contract agreement, approved construction method and meets client satisfaction.” (Yahya, 2009).

'''Rapid construction''' can be achieved through the basic principle of focusing on eliminating waste. The criteria of stabilizing the work flow can be achieved by injecting [[lean manufacturing]] principles into the construction process flow. [[Lean construction]] is a new way to manage construction. The objective, principles and techniques of lean construction taken together form the basis for a rapid project delivery process. Unlike current approaches to managing construction (including [[Design-Build|design-build]]) and programmatic improvement efforts (partnering), lean construction provides the foundation for an operations based rapid construction project delivery system. While the transformation-flow-value theory broadens the understanding of [[project management]], the perception of construction as a complex phenomenon opens up for the introduction of completely new approaches to project management. The ordered approach which gave rise to what can be called management-as-planning and management-as organizing should be reinterpreted and supplemented in future project management. Management as co-operation and as learning comes into focus. The consultant and contractor’s familiarity with the system led to significant reductions in construction time and improvements in overall economy. The use of material and workflow in this technology is to provide rapid construction, decrease [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental impacts]], increase durability, and reduce on-site labour, resulting in better work zone safety.

'''Tapari''' (Nepali: टपरी) is a leaf plate used in [[Nepal]]. Tapari is used as a plate in traditional feasts during different religious ceremonies like marriage. Nowadays tapari are used to serve food not only during traditional wedding parties and religious ceremonies, but even by urban fast food stalls.&lt;ref name=tapari&gt;{{cite web|title=Tapari|url=http://medep.org.np/index.php?page=sub_page&amp;page_id=63&amp;id=49|publisher=[[Micro-Enterprise Development Programme]] (MEDEP)|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients==
Tapari is made from mature green leaves of [[Shorea robusta]] (sal tree). Leaves are gathered and stitched together with bamboo fine sticks called ''sinkaa''.

'''The Art and Olfaction Awards''' are a non-profit award mechanism designed to celebrate excellence in international artisan, experimental and independent [[perfume]]ry and [[olfactory art]] through a yearly blind-judged competition.

== Mission ==

The organization states the following as its mission:

"''Awarded to just four perfumes and one experimental project a year, The Art and Olfaction Award is designed to raise interest and awareness for independent and artisan perfumers - and experimental practitioners with scent - from all countries. By shining a spotlight on perfumery’s most outstanding creators, we hope to help generate support for independent practices in perfumery as a whole. The Art and Olfaction Awards are a program of [[The Institute for Art and Olfaction,]] a 501(c)3 non-profit organization based in Los Angeles, USA.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artandolfactionawards.org/about-2/|title=About|date=2013-10-26|newspaper=The Art and Olfaction Awards|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Art and Olfaction Awards were founded in 2013 as a program of [[The Institute for Art and Olfaction]] in Los Angeles. The first awards ceremony took place in April, 2014, at [[Goethe-Institut|Goethe Institut]] Los Angeles. At this first event, awards were given in two categories: Independent and Artisan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perfumerflavorist.com/networking/news/company/Niche-Perfumers-Nab-Prizes-at-Art-and-Olfaction-Awards-257943561.html|title=Niche Perfumers Nab Prizes at Art and Olfaction Awards|newspaper=Skin Inc.|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the awards expanded upon their existing categories by adding The Sadakichi Award for Experimental Work with Scent - named after the critic and writer [[Sadakichi Hartmann]] in honor of his failed scent concert from the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/art-and-olfaction-awards-what-did-qaddafi-death-smell-like|title=What Did Qaddafi’s Death Smell Like?|date=2015-04-23|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sadakichi Award was added as "a new category aimed at recognizing innovative uses of scent beyond the bounds of commercial perfumery"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.basenotes.net/features//3133-report-from-the-second-annual-art-and-olfaction-awards|title=Report from the second annual Art &amp; Olfaction Awards ~ by Deadidol — Basenotes.net|website=www.basenotes.net|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; - joining the artisan and independent awards to create what was intended as a broad snapshot of the diversity and creative potential in the field of perfume.

The third annual Art and Olfaction Awards were held on May 6, 2016 at [[Hammer Museum]] as part of their [https://hammer.ucla.edu/programs-events/2016/05/third-annual-art-and-olfaction-awards-with-emcee-zackary-drucker/ public programming]. The expanded event was hosted by artist and producer [[Zackary Drucker]], and was free, open to the public, and live streamed on the internet. In an effort to better cement the award's international commitment, the fourth annual Art and Olfaction Awards take place in May 2017 at [https://www.silent-green.net/ Silent Green kulturquartier] in [[Berlin]]. The finalists are announced yearly at [http://www.esxence.com/ Esxence] in Milan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fragrantica.com/news/2016-Art-and-Olfaction-Awards-Finalists-Announced-at-Esxence-7780.html|title=2016 Art and Olfaction Awards Finalists Announced at Esxence ~ Art Books Events ~ Fragrantica|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art and Olfaction Awards were created as mechanism to impartially judge and promote work being done by artisan perfumers, independent perfume houses, and creative practitioners working with scent in the context of arts or experimental practices. Limited to artists, [[artisan]] perfumers and independent perfume houses (which they define as brands that are independently owned, or owned by another independently-owned company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artandolfactionawards.org/submission/independent-award/|title=Independent Award|date=2014-09-17|newspaper=The Art and Olfaction Awards|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;), they are closed to larger-scale perfume releases - a space already served by [[The Fragrance Foundation]]'s [http://www.fragrance.org/fragrance-awards/ Awards].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fragrantica.com/news/The-ART-and-OLFACTION-AWARDS-5020.html|title=The Art and Olfaction Awards ~ Art Books Events ~ Fragrantica|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that capacity they have been compared&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-orlin/art-and-olfaction-awards_b_6248560.html|title=Art and Olfaction Awards Celebrates Artisan Perfumers {{!}} Huffington Post|last=WineFashionista|first=Mary Orlin The|date=2014-12-01|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the film industry's [[Independent Spirit Awards]]. Indeed, the awards were created based on founder Saskia Wilson-Brown's experience with film festivals:

"''The awards represented a chance to apply what I learned in the film festival world to the perfume world. In fact, we adapted many of the structures that go into running a film festival for the Art and Olfaction Awards, namely: Low entry fees, [...] unbiased judging (in many film festivals you are excluded from judging a film that you have a personal tie to), a diversity of judges, and a non-profit art for arts-sake motivation.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cafleurebon.com/inside-the-institute-for-art-and-olfaction-awards-an-interview-with-saskia-wilson-brown-perfume-without-politics/|title=Saskia-Wilson Brown {{!}} Cafleurebon - Perfume and Beauty Blog|website=www.cafleurebon.com|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several further systems were put into place to ensure fairness, including blind, multiple-phase judging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://colognoisseur.com/tag/2016-art-and-olfaction-awards/|title=2016 art and olfaction awards {{!}} Colognoisseur|website=colognoisseur.com|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was what Luca Turin called '[...]the only fluff-free fragrance contest in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://arabia.style.com/beauty/beauty-guide/best-spring-summer-2015-perfumes-moschino-toy-tom-ford-noir-extreme-skive-canoe-goods-luca-turin-review/2/|title=Luca Turin Reviews Moschino Toy and Tom Ford Noir Extreme {{!}} Style.com/Arabia|date=2015-04-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;'.

'''Very low frequency''' or '''VLF''' is the [[International Telecommunications Union|ITU]] designation&lt;ref name="ITU Nomenclature"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rec. ITU-R V.431-7, Nomenclature of the frequency and wavelength bands used in telecommunications |url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/v/R-REC-V.431-7-200005-I!!PDF-E.pdf |publisher=ITU |accessdate=20 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031020427/http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/v/R-REC-V.431-7-200005-I%21%21PDF-E.pdf |archive-date=31 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Radio frequency|radio frequencies]] (RF) in the range of 3 to 30&amp;nbsp;[[kilohertz]] (kHz), corresponding to [[wavelength]]s from 100 to 10 kilometers, respectively.  The band is also known as the '''myriameter band''' or '''myriameter wave''' as the wavelengths range from one to ten [[myriameter]]s (an obsolete metric unit equal to 10 kilometers).  Due to its limited [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[Audio signal|audio]] (voice) transmission is highly impractical in this band, and therefore only low [[Data signaling rate|data rate]] coded signals are used.  The VLF band is used for a few [[radio navigation]] services, government [[Time signal|time radio stations]] (broadcasting time signals to set [[radio clock]]s) and for secure military communication.  Since VLF waves can penetrate at least 40 meters (120&amp;nbsp;ft) into saltwater, they are used for [[military communication]] with [[submarine]]s.

==Propagation characteristics==
Because of their large wavelengths, VLF radio waves can [[Diffraction|diffract]] around large obstacles and so are not blocked by mountain ranges or the horizon, and can propagate as [[ground wave]]s following the curvature of the Earth.  The main mode of long distance propagation is an [[Earth-ionosphere waveguide]] mechanism.&lt;ref name="Hunsucker"&gt;{{cite book

The conductive ionosphere and the conductive Earth form a horizontal "duct" a few VLF wavelengths high, which acts as a [[waveguide]] confining the waves so they don't escape into space.  The waves travel in a zigzag path around the Earth, reflected alternately by the Earth and the ionosphere, in TM ([[transverse magnetic]]) mode.

VLF waves have very low path attenuation, 2-3&amp;nbsp;dB per 1000&amp;nbsp;km,&lt;ref name="Hunsucker" /&gt; with little of the "[[fading]]" experienced at higher frequencies,&lt;ref name="Ghosh" /&gt;  This is because  VLF waves are reflected from the bottom of the ionosphere, while higher frequency shortwave signals are returned to Earth from higher layers in the ionosphere, the [[F1 layer|F1]] and [[F2 layer|F2]] layers, by a refraction process, and spend most of their journey in the ionosphere, so they are much more affected by ionization gradients and turbulence.   Therefore, VLF transmissions are very stable and reliable, and are used for long distance communication.  Propagation distances of 5000 to 20000&amp;nbsp;km have been realized.&lt;ref name="Hunsucker" /&gt;  However, atmospheric noise ([[sferics]]) is high in the band,&lt;ref name="Ghosh" /&gt; including such phenomena as "[[whistler (radio)|whistler]]s", caused by [[lightning]].

VLF waves can penetrate [[seawater]] to a depth of at least 10 to 40 meters (30 to 130 feet), depending on the frequency employed and the salinity of the water, so they are used to communicate with submarines.

VLF waves at certain frequencies have been found to cause [[electron precipitation]].

VLF waves used to communicate with submarines have created an artificial bubble around the Earth that can protect it from [[solar flare]]s and [[coronal mass ejection]]s; this occurred through interaction with high-energy radiation particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/05/wow-guys/527193/ |title=  Humans Accidentally Created a Protective Bubble Around Earth |author= Marina Koren |date= May 18, 2017 |work= [[The Atlantic]] |accessdate= May 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antennas==
[[File:Cutler VLF antenna array.png|thumb|upright=1.5|"Trideco" antenna tower array at the US Navy's [[VLF Transmitter Cutler|Naval Radio Station Cutler]] in Cutler, Maine, USA. The central mast is the radiating element, while the star-shaped horizontal wire array is the capacitive top load.  About 1.2 miles in diameter, it communicates with submerged submarines at 24&amp;nbsp;kHz at a power of 1.8&amp;nbsp;megawatts, the most powerful radio station in the world.]]
[[File:Jim Creek VLF antenna.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Another type of large VLF antenna: the "valley-span" antenna, consisting of multiple horizontal topload cables spanning a valley, fed in the center by vertical radiators.  This example is at the US Navy [[Jim Creek Naval Radio Station|Jim Creek station]] near [[Seattle]], which transmits on 24.8&amp;nbsp;kHz at a power of 1.2&amp;nbsp;MW. ]]

A major practical drawback to this band is that because of the length of the waves, full size resonant antennas ([[half wave dipole]] or [[monopole antenna|quarter wave monopole]] antennas) cannot be built because of their physical height.  Vertical antennas must be used because VLF waves propagate in vertical polarization, but a quarter-wave vertical antenna at 30&amp;nbsp;kHz would be {{convert|2.5|km|ft|abbr=off}} high. So practical transmitting antennas are [[electrical length|electrically short]], a small fraction of a wavelength long.&lt;ref name="Seybold"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to their low [[radiation resistance]] (often less than one ohm) they are inefficient, radiating only 10% to 50% of the transmitter power at most,&lt;ref name="Hunsucker" /&gt;  with the rest of the power dissipated in the antenna/ground system resistances.  Very high power transmitters (~1 megawatt) are required for long distance communication, so the efficiency of the antenna is an important factor.

High power transmitting antennas for VLF frequencies are very large wire antennas, up to a mile across.  They consist of a series of steel [[radio mast]]s, linked at the top with a network of cables, often shaped like an umbrella or clotheslines.  Either the towers themselves or vertical wires serve as [[monopole antenna|monopole]] radiators, and the horizontal cables form a capacitive top-load to increase the efficiency of the antenna.   High power stations use variations on the [[umbrella antenna]] such as the "delta" and "trideco" antennas, or multiwire [[T-aerial|flattop]] (triatic) antennas.  For low power transmitters, inverted-L and [[T-aerial|T antennas]] are used.  A large [[loading coil]] is required at the antenna feed point to cancel the [[capacitive reactance]] of the antenna to make it [[resonant]].

To minimize power dissipated in the ground, these antennas require extremely low resistance [[ground (electricity)|ground]] systems.  Because of soil resistance and dielectric losses in the ground, buried ground systems tend to have unacceptably high losses, and [[Counterpoise (ground system)|counterpoise]] systems are usually used, consisting of radial networks of copper cables supported several feet above the ground under the antenna, extending out radially from the mast or vertical element.

The high capacitance and inductance and low resistance of the antenna-loading coil combination makes it act electrically like a [[Q factor|high Q]] [[tuned circuit]].  VLF antennas have very narrow [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and to change the transmitting frequency requires a variable inductor ([[Transformer types#Variometer and variocoupler|variometer]]) to tune the antenna.  The large VLF antennas used for high power transmitters usually have bandwidths of only a few tens of hertz, and when transmitting [[frequency shift keying]] (FSK), the usual mode, the resonant frequency of the antenna must sometimes be dynamically shifted with the modulation, between the two FSK frequencies.  The high Q of the antenna results in very high voltages at the ends of the horizontal topload wires where the nodes of the standing wave pattern occur, and very good insulation is required.  The practical limit to the power of large VLF transmitters is usually determined by onset of air breakdown and arcing from the antenna.  

The requirements for receiving antennas are less stringent, because of the high level of natural [[atmospheric noise]] in the band.  Atmospheric [[radio noise]] is far above the [[Noise figure|receiver noise]] introduced by the receiver circuit and determines the receiver [[signal to noise ratio]].  So small inefficient receiving antennas can be used, and the low voltage signal from the antenna can simply be amplified by the receiver without introducing significant noise.  [[Loop antenna]]s are usually used for reception.

==Applications==
[[Image:Grimetonmasterna.jpg|thumb|right|[[T antenna|Flattop antenna]] towers of the [[Grimeton Radio Station|Grimeton VLF transmitter]], Varberg, Sweden ]]

The frequency range below 9&amp;nbsp;kHz is not allocated by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] and may be used in some nations license-free.

VLF is used to [[Communication with submarines|communicate with submarines]] near the [[Sea surface|surface]] (for example using the transmitter [[VLF transmitter DHO38|DHO38]]), while [[Extremely low frequency|ELF]] is used for deeply submerged vessels. VLF is also used for radio navigation beacons (alpha) and time signals (beta).

In the USA, the [[time signal]] station [[WWVL]] began transmitting a 500&amp;nbsp;W signal on 20&amp;nbsp;kHz in August 1963.  It used Frequency Shift Keying ([[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]]) to send data, shifting between 20&amp;nbsp;kHz and 26&amp;nbsp;kHz. The WWVL service was discontinued in July 1972.

Historically, this band was used for transcontinental radio communication during the [[wireless telegraphy]] era between about 1900 and 1925.  Nations built networks of high power LF and VLF radio stations that transmitted text information by [[Morse code]],  to communicate with their colonies and naval fleets.    Early attempts were made to use radiotelephone using [[amplitude modulation]] and [[single-sideband modulation]] within the band starting from 20&amp;nbsp;kHz, but the result was unsatisfactory because the available bandwidth was insufficient to contain the [[sideband]]s.  The [[Grimeton VLF transmitter]] at Grimeton near Varberg in [[Sweden]], one of the few remaining transmitters from that era that has been preserved as a historical monument, can be visited by the public at certain times, such as on [[Alexanderson Day]].

Naturally occurring signals in the VLF band are used for long range lightning location and for research into phenomena such as [[Upper-atmospheric lightning|transient luminous events]].  Measurements of [[Whistler (radio)|whistlers]] are employed to infer the physical properties of the [[magnetosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plasmon.elte.hu/awdanet.htm|title=AWDANet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geophysicists]] use VLF-[[electromagnetic]] receivers to measure conductivity in the near surface of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geonics.com/html/vlfsystems.html|title=Geonics Limited - VLF Receivers|accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==VLF submarine and aircraft communication methods==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
High power land-based and aircraft transmitters in countries that operate submarines send signals that can be received thousands of miles away. Transmitter sites typically cover great areas (many [[acres]] or square kilometers), with transmitted power anywhere from 20&amp;nbsp;kW to 2 MW. Submarines receive signals from land based and aircraft transmitters using some form of towed antenna that floats just under the surface of the water – for example a BCAA ([[Buoyant Cable Array Antenna]]). Modern receivers use sophisticated [[digital signal processing]] techniques to remove the effects of atmospheric noise (largely caused by lightning strikes around the world) and adjacent channel signals, extending the useful reception range. Strategic nuclear bombers of the United States Air Force receive VLF signals as part of hardened nuclear resilient operations.

Because of the low bandwidth available it is not possible to transmit [[audio signal]]s, therefore all messaging is done with text data at very low bit rates. Three types of [[modulation]] are used:{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* OOK / CWK: On-Off Keying / Continuous Wave Keying. Simple [[Morse code]] transmission mode where the carrier is turned on and off, with carrier on representing the Morse code "dots" and "dashes" and carrier off representing spaces.  This is the simplest possible form of radio transmission, but it is difficult for transmitters to transmit high power levels, and the signal can easily be swamped by atmospheric noise, so this is used really only for emergencies or basic testing.
* FSK: [[Frequency-shift keying]]. The oldest and simplest form of digital radio data modulation, with the carrier shifted between two frequencies, one representing the binary digit "1" and the other representing binary "0".  For example, the frequency may be increased by 25&amp;nbsp;Hz from the carrier frequency to indicate a "1" and reduced by 25&amp;nbsp;Hz to indicate "0". FSK is used at rates of 50 bit/s and 75 bit/s.
* MSK: [[Minimum-shift keying]]. A more sophisticated modulation method that uses less bandwidth for a given data rate than FSK. This is the normal mode for submarine communications today, and can be used at data rates up to 300 bit/s- or about 35 8-bit [[ASCII]] characters per second (or the equivalence of a sentence every two seconds) – a total of 450 words per minute.

Two alternative character sets may be used: 5-bit [[ITA2]] or 8-bit [[ASCII]]. Because these are military transmissions they are almost always [[encrypted]] for security reasons. Although it is relatively easy to receive the transmissions and convert them into a string of characters, enemies cannot decode the encrypted messages; military communications usually use unbreakable [[one-time pad]] [[cipher]]s since the amount of text is so small.

==PC-based VLF reception==

[[File:VLF 18.1 kHz spectrogram.svg|thumb|[[Spectrogram]] of a 18.1 kHz VLF signal, picked up using a small [[loop antenna]] and a sound card. The vertical stripes are distant lightnings.]]
VLF signals are often monitored by [[radio amateur]]s using simple homemade VLF [[radio receiver]]s based on personal computers (PCs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aerial in the form of a coil of insulated wire is connected to the input of the soundcard of the PC (via a jack plug) and placed a few meters away from it. [[Fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) software in combination with a sound card allows reception of all frequencies below the [[Nyquist frequency]] simultaneously in the form of [[spectrogram]]mes. Because CRT monitors are strong sources of noise in the VLF range, it is recommended to record the spectrograms with any PC CRT monitors turned off. These spectrograms show many signals, which may include VLF transmitters and the horizontal electron beam deflection of TV sets. The strength of the signal received can vary with a [[Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance|sudden ionospheric disturbance]]. These cause the ionization level to increase in the ionosphere producing a rapid change to the amplitude and phase of the received VLF signal.

==Amateur radio==
Radio amateurs in some countries have been granted permission (or have assumed permission) to operate at frequencies below 8.3&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cept.org/Documents/wg-fm/24788/fm-15-119_sub-9-khz-spectrum-in-the-amateur-service|title=Sub 9kHz spectrum in the Amateur Service|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radiated power from amateur stations is very small, ranging from 1&amp;nbsp;μW to 100&amp;nbsp;μW for fixed base station antennas, and up to 10&amp;nbsp;mW from kite or balloon antennas. Despite the low power, stable propagation with low attenuation in the [[Earth-ionosphere waveguide|earth-ionosphere cavity]] enable very narrow bandwidths to be used to reach distances up to several thousand km.  The modes used are [[QRP operation#QRSS|QRSS]], [[Multiple frequency-shift keying|MFSK]], and coherent [[Phase-shift keying|BPSK]].

Operations tend to congregate around the frequencies 8.27&amp;nbsp;kHz, 6.47&amp;nbsp;kHz, 5.17&amp;nbsp;kHz and 2.97&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abelian.org/vlf/amateur-radio|title=Some recent milestones with amateur radio experiments at VLF|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bandwidths of a few tens of uHz are typical and both receiver and transmitter must have their frequency locked to a stable reference such as a [[GPS disciplined oscillator]] or a [[rubidium standard]].

The transmitter generally consists of an audio amplifier of a few hundred watts, an impedance matching transformer, a [[loading coil]] and a large wire antenna.  Receivers employ an electric field probe or magnetic loop antenna, a sensitive audio preamplifier, isolating transformers, and a PC [[sound card]] to digitise the signal. Extensive [[digital signal processing]] is required to retrieve the weak signals from beneath [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]] from [[Harmonics (electrical power)|power line harmonics]] and [[Radio atmospheric|VLF radio atmospherics]]. Useful received signal strengths are as low as {{val|3|e=-8}}&amp;nbsp;volts/meter (electric field) and {{val|1|e=-16}}&amp;nbsp;tesla (magnetic field), with [[signaling rate]]s typically between 1 and 100 bits per hour.

The '''Wheeler No. 1 Oil Well''' was the first well drilled in the [[Drumright-Cushing Oil Field]] of northeast [[Oklahoma]], near [[Drumright, Oklahoma|Drumright]]. The success of the well, drilled in 1912 by [[Thomas Baker Slick, Sr.]], led to the development of the Cushing field and gave impetus to the early development of Oklahoma oilfields.&lt;ref name=nrhpinv1&gt;{{cite web|last=Carney|first=George O.|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination Form: Wheeler Oil Well No. 1|url={{NRHP url|id=83002083}}|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=7 May 2013|date=July 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Drumright-Cushing field would go on to produce 310,000 barrels of oil a day at its peak in May 1917.&lt;ref name=aoghs1&gt;{{cite web|title=Oklahoma’s King of the Wildcatters|url = http://aoghs.org/oil-and-gas-history/oklahomas-king-of-the-wildcatters/ |publisher=American Oil &amp; Gas Historical Society |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eohc2&gt;Weaver, Bobby D.

The well was financed by Charles B. Shaffer of Chicago, who hired Slick to drill wells at the Frank Wheeler farm using [[Drilling rig#Cable tool drilling|cable tool drilling techniques]], which could not prevent gushers or [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowouts]]. Three unsuccessful wells preceded the strike, which initially produced 400 barrels of high-grade oil a day from a depth of between {{convert|2319|ft|m}} and {{convert|2347|ft|m}}.  Because no mechanism existed to control the flow, the oil was diverted into pits for collection and storage. The source of the oil was a sand zone in the Drumright Dome, a [[syncline]].&lt;ref name= nrhpinv1 /&gt; Slick attempted to keep the strike secret, hiring armed guards,&lt;ref name=newson6-1&gt;{{cite web|last= Day|first= Craig|title= Drumright Oil Well Nears Its Centennial | url = http://www.newson6.com/story/16996085/drumright-oil-well-nears-its-centennial | publisher = News on 6 | date =February 22, 2012|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but eventually revealed the well's success in April 1912.&lt;ref name =eohc1/&gt; A dugout built for the guards remains on the site, together with a commemorative plaque.&lt;ref name = newson6-1 /&gt;

In time, the well's pressure subsided, requiring that the oil be pumped out of the well. The first pump was a two-cylinder gasoline-powered pump, later replaced by an electric drive.  With the reduction in pressure the well was modified for [[Extraction of petroleum#Secondary recovery|secondary recovery]], using an early form of [[hydraulic fracturing]] called "sand fracturing."&lt;ref name=nrhpinv1/&gt; As of 1980 it produced about a barrel a day, pumping four hours a day. Oil came from three layers: the Layton layer at {{convert|170|ft|m}}, the Wheeler layer at {{convert |2300|ft|m}}, and the Bartlesville layer at {{convert|2700|ft|m}}. A {{convert|2|in|cm|adj=on}} pipeline connects the well to an oil-water separating unit about {{convert|2500|ft|m}} away, then to storage tanks. The well is located in a small clearing about {{convert|1000|ft|m}} west of Drumright.&lt;ref name=nrhpinv1/&gt; The well was still producing in 2012.&lt;ref name=newson6-1 /&gt;

The Wheeler No. 1 well was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on March 14, 1983.&lt;ref name = "nris" /&gt;

'''Wirephoto''', '''telephotography''' or '''radiophoto''' is the sending of [[pictures]] by [[telegraph]], [[telephone]] or [[radio]].

[[Western Union]] transmitted its first [[halftone]] [[photograph]] in 1921. [[AT&amp;T]] followed in 1924,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and RCA sent a ''Radiophoto'' in 1926. The [[Associated Press]] began its Wirephoto service in 1935 and held a [[trademark]] on the term ''AP Wirephoto'' between 1963 and 2004. The first AP photo sent by wire depicted the crash of a small plane in New York's [[Adirondack Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;

Technologically and commercially, the wirephoto was the successor to [[Ernest A. Hummel]]'s '''Telediagraph''' of 1895, which had transmitted electrically scanned [[shellac]]-on-foil originals over a dedicated circuit connecting the ''[[New York Herald]]'' and the ''[[Chicago Times Herald]]'', the ''[[St. Louis Republic]]'', the ''[[Boston Herald]]'', and the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Édouard Belin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Édouard Belin]] and his Belinograph]]
[[Édouard Belin]]'s '''Belinograph''' of 1913, which scanned using a [[photocell]] and transmitted over ordinary phone lines, formed the basis for the AT&amp;T Wirephoto service. In Europe, services similar to a wirephoto were called a Belino.

The first wirephoto systems were slow and did not reproduce well. In 1929, Dr. [[Vladimir Zworykin]], an electronics engineer working for Western Electric, came up with a system that produced a better reproduction and could transmit a full page in approximately one minute.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1930s, wirephoto machines of any reasonable speed were very large and expensive and required a dedicated phone line. News media firms like [[Associated Press]] used expensive leased telephone lines to transmit wirephotos. In the mid-1930s a technology battle began for less expensive portable wirephoto equipment that could transmit photos over standard phone lines. A prototype device in the experimental stage was available in [[San Francisco]] in 1935 when the large Navy airship USS ''[[USS Macon (ZRS-5)|Macon]]'' crashed into the [[Pacific Ocean]] off the coast of [[California]].  A photo was taken and transmitted to [[New York City]] over regular phone lines. Later, a wirephoto copier and transmitter that could be carried anywhere and needed only a standard long-distance phone line was put into use by [[International News Service|International News Photos]].&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2529">The '''Working Group on Women in Physics''' of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP) was formed by resolution of the Atlanta IUPAP General Assembly in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Women in Physics|journal=Chemistry International|date=March–April 2003|volume=25|issue=2|url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2003/2502/bw5_hartline.html|publisher=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mandate of the group is:
*to survey the present situation and report to the Council and the liaison committees and 
*to suggest means to improve the situation for women in physics.

To carry out this charge the Working Group has, among other things, organized six International Conferences ([[Paris]], France in 2002, [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil in 2005, [[Seoul]], South Korea in 2008, [[Stellenbosch]], South Africa in 2011, [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], Canada in 2014 and [[Birmingham]], UK in 2017) gathering teams from more than 60 countries that collected data on their local situation of women in [[physics]].  It also promoted and collaborated with the elaboration of a global survey of physicists that was carried on by the  Statistical Research Center of the [[American Institute of Physics|American Institute of Physics (AIP)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aip.org/statistics/reports/global-survey-physicists|title=Global Survey of Physicists|date=2013-09-19|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aip.org/statistics/reports/there-land-equality-physicists|title=Is There a Land of Equality for Physicists?|date=2015-09-08|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; . The IUPAP Working Group is currently involved in the elaboration of a new survey that will include other natural sciences and mathematics within the framework of  the Gender Gap in Science Project &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icsugendergapinscience.org/|title=Gender Gap in Science|website=Gender Gap in Science|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the International Council for Science, ICSU&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icsu.org/|title=ICSU|work=International Council for Science — ICSU|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''Zetatron''' is a high-voltage [[vacuum tube]] device that generates a stream of [[neutrons]]. The stream can be continuous, or rapidly pulsed on and off. It was invented by [[Sandia National Laboratories]], and is manufactured and marketed by the [[Thermo Electron Corporation]]. Applications include research, explosives detection, well logging and body fat analysis.
