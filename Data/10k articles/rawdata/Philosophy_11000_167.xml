'''Altan Khan''' of the Tümed (1507–1582; {{lang-mn|Алтан хан}}; [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 阿爾坦汗), whose given name was '''[[Anda (Mongol)|Anda]]''' ({{MongolUnicode|ᠠᠨᠳᠠ}} in [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]; 俺答 in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]), was the leader of the [[Tümed]] Mongols&lt;ref name="Dardess2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=John W.

A. (1972). ''Tibetan Civilization'', pp. 81-82. Stanford University Press, Stanford California. {{ISBN|978-0-8047-0806-7}} (cloth); {{ISBN|978-0-8047-0901-9}} (paper).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richardson, Hugh E]]. (1984). ''Tibet &amp; its History. Second Edition, Revised and Updated'', p. 41. Shambhala, Boston &amp; London. {{ISBN|978-0-87773-376-8}} (pbk).&lt;/ref&gt;, Shunyi Wang (Prince of Shunyi, [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 顺义王) of [[Ming dynasty]] China,&lt;ref name="Dardess2012" /&gt; and de facto ruler of the Right Wing, or western tribes, of the [[Mongols]]. He was the grandson of [[Dayan Khan]] (1464–1543), a descendant of [[Kublai Khan]] (1215–1294), who had managed to unite a tribal league between the [[Khalkha Mongols]] in the north and the [[Chahars]] (Tsakhars) to the south. His name means "Golden [[Khan (title)|Khan]]" in the Mongolian language.

== Consolidation of power ==
Borjigin Barsboladiin Altan was the second son of [[Bars Bolud Jinong]], and a grandson of [[Batumongke Dayan Khan]] who had re-unified the Mongolian nobility in an attempt to regain the glory of the [[Yuan dynasty]]. Altan Khan ruled the [[Tümed]] and belonged to the Right Wing of the Mongols along with his elder brother [[Gün Bilig]], who ruled the [[Ordos Desert|Ordos]]. After Gün Bilig's death in 1542, Altan became the de facto leader of the whole of the Right Wing and was given the title, "Tösheetü Sechen Khan".

When [[Bodi Alagh Khan]], the [[Khagan]] of the Mongols from the [[Chahar (Mongols)|Chahar]], died in 1547, Altan forced Bodi Alagh's successor [[Darayisung Küdeng Khan]] to flee eastward. In 1551 Darayisung made a compromise with Altan in exchange for giving the title "Gegeen Khan" to him.  Altan Khan, who controlled the [[Ordos Mongols|Ordos tumen]] of the Huang He or [[Yellow River]] was well placed to keep pressure on the Chinese and the [[Oirats|Oirat]] Mongols in Tibet while developing both agriculture and trade.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', 15th Edition (1977), Vol. 12, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1571, Altan Khan was granted the title Prince of Shunyi ("Obedient and Righteous prince") from the [[Longqing Emperor]], the 12th emperor of Ming dynasty.&lt;ref name="ChuluunBulag2013"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sampildondov Chuluun |author2=Uradyn E.

Altan Khan also founded the city of Köke Khota ([[Hohhot]], meaning "The Blue City"), now the capital of the [[Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]] of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="The New Encyclopædia Britannica 1977 p. 275"&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', 15th Edition (1977), Vol. I, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an impressive statue of him in one of the city's main squares.

== Alliance with the Gelug ==
[[File:Altankhan.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Altan Khan as icon of Buddhism.]]

Altan Khan is particularly remembered for establishing ties between Mongolia and the religious leaders of the Tibetan [[Gelug]] order. Altan Khan first invited [[3rd Dalai Lama]] to Tümed in 1569, but apparently he refused to go and sent a disciple instead, who reported back to him about the great opportunity to spread Buddhist teachings throughout [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;Norbu, Thubten Jigme and Turnbull, Colin M. (1968). ''Tibet: An account of the history, religion and the people of Tibet'', p. 218. Touchstone Books, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-671-20099-2}} (hbk); {{ISBN|978-0-671-20559-1}} (pbk).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1571, Altan Khan got the title Prince of Shunyi ("Obedient and Righteous Prince") from Longqing Emperor (March 4, 1537- July 5, 1572), the 12th emperor of China (Ming dynasty). In 1573, Altan Khan took some Tibetan Buddhist monks prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, R. A. (1972). ''Tibetan Civilization'', p. 81. Stanford University Press, Stanford California. {{ISBN|978-0-8047-0806-7}} (cloth); {{ISBN|978-0-8047-0901-9}} (paper).&lt;/ref&gt; Prince of Shunyi's capital was given new name Guihua meaning "return to civilization. He became very interested in Gelukpa, and Beijing was happy to provide him with Tibetan lamas, Tibetan scriptures, and translations.&lt;ref name="Dardess2012" /&gt;

Sonam Gyatso accepted Altan Khan's invitation to Tümed in 1577.&lt;ref name="mckay3"&gt;McKay 2003, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Altan Khan later had [[Thegchen Chonkhor]], Mongolia's first monastery, built at the place of the meeting.&lt;ref name="Laird, Thomas 2006 p. 144"&gt;Laird, Thomas (2006). ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', p. 144. Grove Press, N.Y. {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1827-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the ruler of the [[Khalkha Mongols]], [[Abtai Sain Khan]], rushed to Tümed to meet the Dalai Lama. The [[Erdene Zuu Monastery]] ({{lang-mn|Эрдэнэ Зуу}}) was built by him in 1586, at the site of the former Mongol capital of [[Karakorum]] following his adoption of Buddhism as the state religion.&lt;ref&gt;"Erdene Zuu Monastery" {{cite web |url=http://www.mandal.ca/mongolia/e/Erdene_Zuu_Monastery.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215070918/http://www.mandal.ca/mongolia/e/Erdene_Zuu_Monastery.html |archivedate=15 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }} accessed 7 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This monastery is also often (wrongly) referred to as the first monastery in Mongolia and it grew into a massive establishment. In 1792, it contained 62 temples and some 10,000 lamas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discover.mn/mongolia/visit.html Discover Mongolia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213011855/http://www.discover.mn/mongolia/visit.html |date=13 December 2007 }} Accessed 7 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonam Gyatso publicly announced that he was a reincarnation of the Tibetan [[Sakya]] monk [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa]] (1235–1280) who converted [[Kublai Khan]], while Altan Khan was a reincarnation of Kublai Khan (1215–1294), the famous ruler of the [[Mongol Empire]] and Emperor of China, and that they had come together again to cooperate in propagating the Buddhist religion.&lt;ref name="Laird, Thomas 2006 p. 146"&gt;Laird, Thomas (2006). ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', p. 146. Grove Press, N.Y. {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1827-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Altan Khan designated Sonam Gyatso as "Dalai" (a translation into Mongolian of the name Gyatso, meaning "ocean").&lt;ref name="mckay3" /&gt; As a result, Sonam Gyatso became known as the [[Dalai Lama]] which, since then, has been used as a title – frequently translated into English as "Ocean of Wisdom". The title was also posthumously given to [[Gendun Drup]] and [[Gendun Gyatso]], who were considered Sonam Gyatso's previous incarnations.&lt;ref name="mckay2"&gt;McKay 2003, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Sonam Gyatso was recognized as being already the 3rd Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="mckay2" /&gt;

Sonam Gyatso never returned to Tibet but remained proselytizing among the Mongols.&lt;ref name="mckay2"&gt;McKay 2003, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The Tümed Mongols and their allies were brought into the [[Gelug]] tradition, which was to become the main spiritual orientation of the Mongols in the ensuing centuries.&lt;ref name="mckay2" /&gt;

Sonam Gyatso's message was that the time had come for Mongolia to embrace Buddhism, that from that time on there should be no more animal sacrifices, there must be no taking of life, animal or human, military action must be pursued only with purpose and the immolation of women on the funeral pyres of their husbands must be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Norbu, Thubten Jigme and Turnbull, Colin M. (1968). ''Tibet: An account of the history, religion and the people of Tibet'', p. 219. Touchstone Books, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-671-20099-2}} (hbk); {{ISBN|978-0-671-20559-1}} (pbk).&lt;/ref&gt; He also secured an edict abolishing the Mongol custom of blood-sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, R. A. (1972). Tibetan Civilization, p. 82. Stanford University Press, Stanford California. {{ISBN|978-0-8047-0806-7}} (cloth); {{ISBN|978-0-8047-0901-9}} (paper).&lt;/ref&gt; "These and many other such laws were set forth by Gyalwa Sonam Gyatso and were instituted by Altan Khan."&lt;ref&gt;Mullin, Glenn H. (2001). ''The Fourteen Dalai Lamas: A Sacred Legacy of Reincarnation,'' p. 146. Clear Light Publishers, Santa Fe, New Mexico. {{ISBN|978-1-57416-092-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A massive program of translating Tibetan (and Sanskrit)&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', 15th Edition (1977), Vol. 12, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; texts into Mongolian was commenced, with letters written in silver and gold and paid for by the Dalai Lama's Mongolian devotees. Within 50 years virtually all Mongols had become Buddhist, with tens of thousands of monks, who were members of the [[Gelug]] order, loyal to the Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="Laird, Thomas 2006 p. 144" /&gt;

When Sonam Gyatso died in 1588, his incarnation – and thus, the new Dalai Lama – was Altan Khan's great-grandson.&lt;ref name="mckay2" /&gt;

==Military exploits==

Altan Khan used his military strength to threaten the [[Ming dynasty]] of China. He led raids into inland China in 1529, 1530 and 1542 returning with plunder and livestock. In 1550 he crossed the Great Wall and besieged [[Beijing]], setting the suburbs on fire.&lt;ref&gt;Laird, Thomas (2006). ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', p. 141. Grove Press, N.Y. {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1827-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1552 Altan Khan gained control of the remains of Karakorum, the old Mongol capital.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', 15th Edition (1977), Vol. 9, p. 601.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese emperor was forced to grant special trading rights to the [[khanate]], after signing a peace treaty with him in 1571, allowing it to trade horses for silks, which further strengthened it economically. The Chinese also granted him the title of Prince of Shunyi ("Obedient and Righteous prince").&lt;ref name="The New Encyclopædia Britannica 1977 p. 275" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laird, Thomas 2006 p. 143"&gt;Laird, Thomas (2006). ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', p. 143. Grove Press, N.Y. {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1827-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign he made several successful military campaigns to the west against rebellious Oirats, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz, bringing them back under his rule.

==Death==
Altan Khan died in 1582, only four years after meeting with the Third Dalai Lama. He was 74 or 75 years old at the time.&lt;ref name="Laird, Thomas 2006 p. 146" /&gt;

==Succession==

Altan Khan's title Prince of Shunyi was succeeded by his son [[Sengge Düüreng]] who was supported by the [[Ming]] court.&lt;ref name="Wallace2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vesna A. Wallace|title=Buddhism in Mongolian History, Culture, and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K2OzBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-995866-5|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altan Khan's great-grandson, Yonten Gyatso, was selected as the [[4th Dalai Lama]].

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Moorjani was born to [[Indian people|Indian]] parents Hargobind (father) and Neelu (mother) Shamdasani in [[Singapore]]. Shortly after her birth, her family moved to [[Sri Lanka]], and then at age two, moved to [[Hong Kong]], where she and her older brother Anoop grew up. Anita and her brother both studied in British schools. As an ethnic minority in a majority British school, Moorjani says she was often the victim of bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaye|first1=Randi|title=Stories of life, death and faith: 'To Heaven and Back'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/29/us/to-heaven-and-back/|accessdate=3 September 2014 |publisher=CNN|date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moorjani's parents are Indian, and because of her diverse cultural background, grew up multilingual, speaking [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] (an Indian language), [[Cantonese]] (a Chinese dialect) and [[English language|English]] simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proud to Be Me Growing up in a cultural mélange|url=http://www.healyourlife.com/proud-to-be-me|publisher=Hay House|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near Death Experience (NDE)===
In February 2002, while living and working in [[Hong Kong]], Moorjani was diagnosed with [[lymphoma]] after finding a lump on her neck. Initially, Moorjani rejected conventional medicine. She had watched several people close to her die of cancer, including her brother-in-law and her best friend, despite extensive conventional treatments. Over the months that ensued, Moorjani experimented with various alternative healing practices, but to no avail. She subsequently underwent several conventional cancer treatments.  However, by that point, despite these treatments, her doctors informed her and her family that it was "too late" to save her life. The lymphoma had spread throughout her body and had metastasized. Moorjani had large lemon sized tumors all over her upper body from her neck to her abdomen. Her body would no longer absorb nourishment, her lungs were perpetually filled with fluid that needed to be drained regularly, and she was connected to piped oxygen. On 2 February 2006, she fell into a deep coma. The doctors told her family that her body had gone into organ failure and she was in her final hours of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moorjani|first1=Anita|title=My Journey from Cancer, to Near Death, to True Healing|date=1 March 2012|publisher=Hay House; Unabridged Version edition (1 March 2012)|location=USA|isbn=978-1401937515|page=98|edition=1st|url=http://www.hayhouse.com/dying-to-be-me-paperback|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moorjani came out of the coma thirty hours later and told her family that during her NDE, she had been greeted by her deceased father and deceased best friend, who had told her that it was not her time to die. During those 30 hours, Moorjani experienced many characteristic details of a [[Near-death experience|near death experience]] as well as details unique to her. Her account includes an [[out-of-body experience]] with observations and awareness of physical surroundings. Moorjani said she had a strong reluctance to return to her suffering and dying physical body, but was encouraged to return by her father and best friend who told her that she needed to return and to "live her life fearlessly".{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Subsequent to coming out of her coma, Moorjani experienced a [[spontaneous healing]]. Her tumors shrunk by about 70% within four days, and within five weeks, she was cancer-free and released from hospital, although she had to spend a few months in physiotherapy to regain her strength and the use of all her muscles and limbs.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Professional life===
Shortly after her full recovery, Moorjani started sharing her story and the insights she gained from her NDE on the internet. She submitted the description of her NDE and subsequent healing to the Near Death Experience Research Foundation (NDERF) website, a site owned and run by oncologist Dr. Jeffrey Long and his wife, Jody Long, a family law attorney . [http://www.nderf.org/ NDERF] is a site dedicated to NDE research and within hours of submitting her story, Moorjani was contacted by Dr. Long, who questioned Moorjani further to verify her case, and subsequently posted her story on the home page of his website as he felt hers was an "exceptional NDE". Although NDERF has thousands of NDE stories, Moorjani's story went viral, and created enormous interest on an international scale.&lt;ref name="Dr. Jeffrey Long, NDERF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anita M's NDE|url=http://www.nderf.org/NDERF/NDE_Experiences/anita_m's_nde.htm|publisher=Near Death Experience Research Foundation (NDERF)|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after her recovery, The [[University of Hong Kong]] learned of Anita's spontaneous remission from her oncologist, who introduced Moorjani to the head of the Department of Behavioral Sciences. She was then invited to address the faculty and students on a regular basis, to speak about topics such as facing death, facing a prognosis of terminal illness, dealing with cancer, how to support someone with a terminal illness, fear and stress from illness, and so on.

As her story was further promulgated via the internet, people from all over the globe began contacting her through the NDERF website to ask questions about her NDE and to seek advice or counsel. She subsequently set up her own website, and soon received hundreds of emails a week from people wanting to know more about her experience or how to deal with illness and other topics germane to her experience.

Her story came to the attention of American self-help author, [[Wayne Dyer|Dr. Wayne Dyer]], who contacted his publishers, [[Hay House]], asking them to locate Moorjani and suggest that she write a book, which they would publish.&lt;ref name="PBS: Wayne Dyer Special"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dyer|first1=Wayne|title=Dr. Wayne Dyer: Wishes Fulfilled|url=https://www.pbs.org/program/dr-wayne-dyer-wishes-fulfilled/|publisher=PBS|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dying to be Me'' was published in March 2012, and hit ''The New York Times'' bestsellers list two weeks after its release. Moorjani was then invited to be on [https://www.pbs.org/program/dr-wayne-dyer-wishes-fulfilled/ Wayne Dyer's PBS special titled "Wishes Fulfilled"], and since then, has been interviewed on [http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-and-friends/as-seen-on/dying-be-me-anita-moorjani "Fox And Friends"]; CNN's [http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/27/anderson-cooper-special-report-to-heaven-and-back/?iref=allsearch "Anderson Cooper 360"]; National Geographic International, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1VG7895XnU Karen Davila's Headstart on ANC Philippines],  among many others. ''Dying to be Me'' has subsequently sold over a million copies worldwide, and has been published in more than 40 languages.

As a featured Hay House author, Anita travels the globe on behalf of her publisher speaking at conferences such as [http://www.hayhouse.com/lectures-events/?event_type=1 I Can Do It] and gives seminars to large audiences at Conferences such as [http://fora.tv/2013/12/12/anita_moorjani_dying_to_be_me UPLIFT], and [http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Dying-to-be-me-Anita-Moorjani-a;search%3Aanita%20moorjani TEDx].

On 15 April 2015, Deadline reported that the New York Times best selling book ''Dying To Be Me'' has been optioned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/04/ridley-scott-dying-to-be-me-giannina-facio-anita-moorjani-1201410817/|title=Ridley Scott, Giannina Facio Tap Miracle Tale 'Dying To Be Me'|first=Mike Fleming|last=Jr|date=15 April 2015|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to internationally acclaimed producer [[Ridley Scott]]'s company Ridley Scott Films.

In January 2016, Moorjani's case attracted the attention of [http://www.doctoroz.com/ Dr. Oz], who scrutinized her medical records, and subsequently invited her to be on his show, which [http://www.doctoroz.com/episode/back-dead-what-these-people-saw-when-they-crossed-over?video_id=4795900782001 aired on 10 March 2016].

==Ideas==

===Teachings===
Moorjani asserts that her cancer was caused by her emotional state, and preaches the message that a person's physical health is affected by their emotional well being.

===Controversies===
Skeptics criticize the message that Anita speaks. Vicky Allen, journalist at The Herald Scotland, states "These people are at the centre of a disturbing approach to illness, and cancer in particular, that sees it as a disease to be tackled with the mind and positive thinking. It is a movement which many within the medical establishment believe is dangerous." Dr Peter Allmark of Sheffield Hallam University, co-author of a 2011 paper, A Critique Of Positive Thinking In Cancer Care, denounces the approach as "quackery".&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Vicky|title=Is there a negative side to positive thinking?|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/health/is-there-a-negative-side-to-positive-thinking.18891504|accessdate=3 September 2014 |newspaper=The Herald Scotland|date=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Moorjani herself says that her experience cannot be reduced to positive thinking or mind control.

==Medical explanation of recovery from cancer==
Oncologist haematologist T.K. Chan, who treated Moorjani at the critical stage of her illness, ascribed her recovery to the draining of her lungs carried out by medical specialists after she was admitted to hospital, followed by chemotherapy which she had refused for three and a half years. Chan stated "with lymphoma, it's never too late" and "Hodgkin's disease is quite curable .. it can have a dramatic response to chemotherapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parry|first1=Hazel|title=A remarkable recovery, but was it mind over matter or modern science?|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/580612/remarkable-recovery-was-it-mind-over-matter-or-modern-science|accessdate=21 March 2018|work=South China Morning Post: International Edition|date=3 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Peter Ko, MD, an assistant clinical professor at the University of California, heard about Moorjani's recovery and decided to investigate. He gained access, with her permission, to her medical records. He concluded: "Her recovery was certainly remarkable. Based on my own experience and opinions of several colleagues, I am unable to attribute her dramatic recovery to her chemotherapy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theepochtimes.com/woman-has-spiritual-near-death-experience-cancer-cured-as-result_2043141.html|title=Woman Has Spiritual Near-Death Experience, Cancer Cured as Result?|date=28 April 2016|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Moorjani met her husband, Danny Moorjani in [[Hong Kong]], and they married in December 1995.  She also has an elder brother, Anoop Shamdasani.  When she is not traveling and speaking at conferences all over the globe, Anita spends part of her time in Hong Kong and part of her time in California.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[Image:Anna Camaiti.jpg|thumb|upright|Anna Camaiti Hostert]]
'''Anna Camaiti Hostert''' (born July 19, 1949, in [[Florence]], Italy) is an [[Italian American]] philosopher and a scholar of [[Visual Studies]]. She lives and works between Italy and the United States.

==Biography==
She obtained her degree in Philosophy at the [[University of Pisa]] (Italy) defending a dissertation with the philosopher Nicola Badaloni. Then she received a Ph.D in Literature and Film from the [[University of Chicago]]. She has taught at [[Loyola University of Chicago]], at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Illinois, Chicago]], and at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] (Italy). She was ''Visiting Professor'' at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) in Los Angeles and at the Florence campus of the [[New York University]] (NYU) Tisch School of Cinema. She was also ''Distinguished Visiting Professor'' at [[Florida Atlantic University]] (FAU) in Boca Raton. She was Acting Associate Dean at the [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]]’s campus in Rome.

In 1999 she founded along the philosopher [[Mario Perniola]] the magazine ''[[Agalma (journal)|Agalma: Magazine of Aesthetic and Cultural Studies]]'' of whose editorial committee she is still a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.agalmaweb.org/redazione.php# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013182427/http://www.agalmaweb.org/redazione.php# |archive-date=2012-10-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1986 she has been part of the Italian Bar Association of Journalists and for several years the press attaché to the Governor of Tuscany Region. Later, she had a TV program about cinema on RaiSat channel titled ''Metix'' from the title of one of her books. She has been a guest at numerous Film Festivals in Italy and of several TV and radio cultural programs. She has collaborated with the director [[Fiorella Infascelli]] in the movie ''Italiani'' presented at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1998.

She has written for the newspaper ''[[Il Manifesto]]'' .

==Thought==

===History of philosophy and politics===
The initial period of Camaiti Hostert’s research focused on the history of political philosophy following the methodological analysis of Nicola Badaloni, under whose tutelage she studied at the University of Pisa. In her first work, ''Giuseppe Toniolo. Alle origini del partito cattolico'' (1984; ''Giuseppe Toniolo. The origins of the Catholic Party'') – that resulted from her dissertation in Philosophy – she traced the intellectual biography of the thinker [[Giuseppe Toniolo]], by retrieving his prominent figure in the Catholic Movement, and casting light on his role in the subsequent foundation of the first Catholic Party in its relationship with the Marxist concept of the main political subject.

The same historical-philosophical perspective defines also the second work by Camaiti Hostert titled ''Politica e diritto di resistenza. Kant ed Erhard: democrazia e libertà del soggetto'' (1987, ''The Politics and the Right of Resistance. Kant and Erhard: Democracy and Human Freedom''). In this work Camaiti Hostert has traced the relationship between the German Jacobinism, of which Johann Benjamin Erhard is one of the most representative authors, and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]’s theory of Public Right, Political Will and Civil Liberty. Through the concepts of «resistance» and «insurrection», she interprets Erhard’s theses as an attempt to build a theory of the antagonistic subject.

===Cultural studies and identity theory===
Because of her intellectual, academic and existential relation with the United States and with the socio-cultural dynamics of this country, Camaiti Hostert first developed themes related to [[comparative literature]] (see for instance her afterword to the American edition of the [[Dacia Maraini]]’s novel, ''The Silent Duchess'', Feminist Press 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/13/books/the-silence.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Anna+Camaiti+Hostert&amp;st=nyt|title=The Silence|first=Kathryn|last=Harrison|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amatangelo, S. 2002. «Coming to Her Senses: The Journey of the Mother in La Lunga Vita Di Marianna Ucria». ''Italica : Bulletin of the American Association of Teachers of Italian''. 79&lt;/ref&gt;) and then has moved towards the [[Cultural studies]] with the analysis of the [[Post-colonial theory|post-colonial theories]], especially by focusing on the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern subject]] and on identity construction.

Through this research, Camaiti Hostert engages a sometimes critical confrontation with many important cultural theorists like [[Edward Said]], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and [[Homi K. Bhabha]] and with political thinkers, like [[Antonio Gramsci]]. Her major work in this field of investigation is ''Passing. Dissolvere le identità, superare le differenze'' (''Passing. A Strategy to Dissolve Identities and Remap Differences''). Dealing with the complex theme of [[Alterity]] as it relates to the Italian women’s movement, especially to the works of Carla Lonzi&lt;ref&gt;E. Chiti Lucchesi, «Luoghi del non ritorno: sogni, parole e immagini», in Borghi, Liana, and Uta Treder (eds). ''Il globale e l'intimo: luoghi del non ritorno''. Perugia: Morlacchi, 2007: 59&lt;/ref&gt; and the theories of sexual difference, the analysis of ''Passing'' tackles the [[feminist studies]], particularly the point of convergence between [[Post-colonial studies|post-colonial]] and [[gender studies]] ([[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|Gayatri C. Spivak]], [[bell hooks]], [[Teresa de Lauretis]], [[Rosi Braidotti]]) and from that point it expands its reflection to the process of formation of any ethnic and sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;Hardt, Michael, and Antonio Negri. ''Empire''. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 2000: 448&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lingel, Jessa. 2009. «Adjusting the Borders: Bisexual Passing and Queer Theory». ''Journal of Bisexuality''. 9, no. 3-4:381-405&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual studies and film theory===
Visual Studies - that were born as a field of interdisciplinary research on the wake of the Anglo-American [[Cultural Studies]] – have become since the late ‘90s the focus of Camaiti Hostert’s research. In ''Metix. Cinema globale e cultura visuale'' (Meltemi 2004, ''Metix. Global Cinema and Visual Culture'') - work that collects Camaiti Hostert’s findings during those years - she has analyzed the structure of the vision, the dynamics of the gaze and the processes of images production in contemporary cinema (mainly American cinema, but not only [[Hollywood]]).

Visual Studies in general and Camaiti Hostert’s work in particular, interpret images not as isolated objects, but as clusters of several practices which change use and meaning of the images themselves: if cinema represents the medium from which Camaiti Hostert’s analysis has begun, her analysis expands to all visual languages, including TV, advertisings, Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Michaud, Marie-Christine. 2012. «Culture populaire et séries télévisées». ''Amerika''. no. 6. http://amerika.revues.org/2969&lt;/ref&gt; The pivotal passage of the text is the transition from the idea that an image is able to mean something, to the understanding that this ability is tied with the formation of the subject identity.

According to Camaiti Hostert’s theory [[Visual Studies]] show the similarities between the analysis of the [[visual culture]] and the analysis of the construction of cultural, gender and ethnic identities and differences, with particular attention to the unmasking of visual stereotypes that have represented the various forms of marginality.&lt;ref&gt;De Ruggieri, Francesca. ''Matrix and the city: il corpo ibrido nel cinema e nella cultura visuale''. Pisa: ETS, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

This work is linked to Camaiti Hostert’s parallel research into the field of [[Film Studies]]. Regarding  this domain of studies, the two particularly relevant essays collection (both edited in 2002) are ''Sentire il cinema'' (2002; ''Feeling Cinema'') - entirely composed of Camaiti Hostert’s essays and interviews (with directors such [[Bernardo Bertolucci]], [[Fiorella Infascelli]], Wilma Labate and [[Mario Martone]]) – and ''Scene italoamericane. Rappresentazioni cinematografiche degli italiani d’America'' edited with the Italian American scholar [[Anthony Julian Tamburri]] (Luca Sossella editore 2002, American edition ''Screening Ethnicity. Cinematographic Representations of Italian Americans in the United States'', [[Bordighera Press]], 2002 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1432/is_2_80/ai_n29018668/?tag=content;col1 |title=CBSi |publisher=FindArticles.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;), including essays by [[Ben Lawton]], Fred Gardaphé, Alberto Abruzzese among others as well as by Camaiti Hostert and Tamburri.

'''Anthroposophic pharmacy''' is the discipline related to conceiving, developing and producing medicinal products according to the [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophic]] understanding of man, nature, substance and pharmaceutical processing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaap.org.uk/downloads/Anthroposophic-medicinal-products-characteristics-and-pharmacological-rationale.pdf, Accessed 2013-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the most characteristic features of [[anthroposophic medicine]] is the attempt to describe health and natural medicine in scientific as well as in spiritual terms. Anthroposophic pharmacy utilises vegetable, mineral and animal materials, manufactured according to particular principles and is sometimes potentised.&lt;ref&gt;Kienle GS, Kiene H, Albonico HU. Anthroposophic Medicine (HTA report). Schattauer; 2006. Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthroposophic medicines should be considered as complementary to conventional medicines and are often used in combination with them.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin-Box D, Williamson EM. Complementary Medicine. A Guide for Pharmacists. Churchill Livingstone; 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a health technology assessment (HTA) produced the first systematic review of the efficacy, utility, costs and safety of anthroposophic medicine as part of the Swiss Government's evaluation of complementary medicine (PEK). The report concluded that there are many studies that show positive outcomes for anthroposophic medicine, although the methodological quality of the studies is very variable. In terms of safety almost all studies emphasise the good tolerability of anthroposophic medicinal therapies.&lt;ref&gt;Kienle GS, Kiene H, Albonico HU. Anthroposophic Medicine (HTA report). Schattauer; 2006. Chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conclusion of the PEK process was that there was insufficient evidence to support reimbursement of any of the five therapies investigated, including both anthroposophic medicine and [[homeopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smw.ch/content/smw-2012-13723/ The report “Homeopathy in healthcare: effectiveness, appropriateness, safety, costs” is not a “Swiss report”], Swiss Medical Weekly, 2012;142:w13594&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and development==
The manufacture and use of anthroposophic medicines dates back to [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861–1925), who together with [[Ita Wegman|Dr Ita Wegman]] (1876–1943) invented anthroposophic medicine at the beginning of the 20th century. Steiner and Wegman's ideas were extended by the chemist Dr Oskar Schmiedel (1887–1959), who manufactured anthroposophic medicines from 1920 onwards and introduced the newly conceived formulations and manufacturing processes into pharmaceutical practice. A second important pioneer of anthroposophic pharmacy was Dr Rudolf Hauschka (1891–1969).

Anthroposophic medicine is now practised in over 60 countries, and for example in Germany is recognised as a special therapy system in the Medicinal Product Act (Arzneimittelgesetz)&lt;ref&gt;Medicinal Products Act (The Drug Law). Section 4, Paragraph 33: Definitions of additional terms. Available from: http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_amg/englisch_amg.html#p0040, German: Gesetz über den Verkehr mit Arzneimitteln. Paragraph 4, Absatz 33: Sonstige Begriffsbestimmungen. Available from:
http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/amg_1976/__4.html&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Code of Social Law (Sozialgesetzbuch) V&lt;ref&gt;Code of Social Law, 5th book (V) / German: Sozialgesetzbuch (SGB) Fünftes Buch (V). Available from: http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/sgb_5/__34.html&lt;/ref&gt; (Paragraph 34, section 3). There are approximately 15,000 doctors in 22 European countries who prescribe anthroposophic medicinal products, e.g. in Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Facts and Figures on Anthroposophic Medicines Worldwide. IVAA (International Federation of Anthroposophic Medical Associations); July 2012. Available from:
http://www.ivaa.info/fileadmin/editor/file/Facts_and_Figures_AM_WorldwideJuly2012_Final_Public_Light.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that in Germany some 6 million patients use anthroposophic medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Background. ECHAMP (European Coalition on Homeopathic and Anthroposophic Medicinal Products). Available from: {{cite web|url=http://www.echamp.eu/background/anthroposophic-medicine.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525185725/http://www.echamp.eu/background/anthroposophic-medicine.html |archivedate=2010-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the German Pharmaceutical Industry Association (BPI), for example, anthroposophicals reached a turnover in 2011 of 52.8 million Euro (Data March 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Pharma-Data 2012 (Page 61). German Pharmaceutical Industry Association (BPI). Available from: http://www.bpi.de/fileadmin/media/bpi/Downloads/Internet/Publikationen/Pharma-Daten/Pharmadaten_2012_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There are about 1,700 different anthroposophic medicinal products on the market in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;Anthroposophic Pharmacy (page 21) in The System of Anthroposophic Medicine. IVAA (International Federation of Anthroposophic Medical Associations); 2011. Available from: http://www.ivaa.info/fileadmin/editor/file/System_AnthroposophicMedicine2011_online.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Within the EU there are differing rules as to whether or not an anthroposophic medicine must be prescribed by a doctor. In Germany, for example, most preparations are not prescription-only, and since 2004 must be paid for by the patient himself.

==Theory and background==
Anthroposophic medicinal products rely on anthroposophical ideas of the relationship between man and nature: "The starting materials of these products come from minerals, plants and animal substances. They are developed and manufactured in accordance with the anthroposophic perception of human beings and nature".&lt;ref&gt;Anthroposophic Pharmacy (page 21) in The System of Anthroposophic Medicine. IVAA (International Federation of Anthroposophic Medical Associations); 2011. Available from: http://www.ivaa.info/fileadmin/editor/file/System_AnthroposophicMedicine2011_online.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy posits four levels of the human being and three systems by which they interact.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin-Box D, Williamson EM. Complementary Medicine. A Guide for Pharmacists. Churchill Livingstone; 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The following table explains the correlation between the four different levels of the human being and the realms of nature as it is understood in anthroposophic pharmacy:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Human being !! Realm of Nature
|-
| Physical constitution is related to ... || mineral world
|-
| Life or etheric body (maintenance of biological identity, regeneration and physiological functions) is related to ... || plant world
|-
| Psychological level or astral body (passion, feeling, movement) is related to ... || animal world
|-
| "Ego" as individual level and self-consciousness is unique to humanity || no correlations
|-
|}

==Pharmaceutical processing==
''Anthroposophic pharmaceutical processing'' involves specific anthroposophic and some typical [[Homeopathy|homoeopathic]] pharmaceutical procedures. The ingredients of anthroposophic medicines are all of natural origin: used are mineral/metallic, vegetable or mineral raw materials e.g. quartz, sulphur, gold, copper, silver, arnica, chamomile or marigold. Animal testing is not used in the development of anthroposophic medicinal products.

Anthroposophic medicines are manufactured principally using rhythmical processes and/or heat. Examples of typical anthroposophic pharmaceutical processes using raw materials of botanical origin are:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Pharmaceutical process'''
| '''Temperature'''
| '''Raw material'''
|-
| Cold maceration
| 2-8&amp;nbsp;°C
| fresh or dried plants, all parts
|-
| Maceration
| ca. 15-20&amp;nbsp;°C
| fresh plants, all parts
|-
| Rhythmic processing
| 4 / 37&amp;nbsp;°C
| fresh plants, all parts
|-
| Digestion
| 37&amp;nbsp;°C
| fresh plants, leaves, flowers
|-
| Infusion
| 60-90&amp;nbsp;°C
| dried leaves, flowers
|-
| Decoction
| ca 100&amp;nbsp;°C
| dried roots, barks, seeds
|-
| Distillation
| steam, ca 100&amp;nbsp;°C
| fresh or dried plants, all parts
|}
These pharmaceutical processes are specified in the European Pharmacopoeia, the Pharmacopoeia Helvetica (Ph.Helv.), the German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia (GHP/HAB), the Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex (APC), and the British Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia (B.Hom.P.).

Another pharmaceutical process often used in anthroposophic pharmacy is ''potentisation'', which is also widely used in homoeopathy. Potentised preparations are gradually diluted substances, whereby at each diluting step a rhythmic shaking and striking against a resilient surface ("succussion") are involved. The principle of potentisation is not supported by any significant body of scientific evidence (see ''[[homeopathic dilutions]]'').

==Production and quality control==
"Anthroposophic medicinal products are produced in accordance with the modern standards of Good Manufacturing Practice [http://ec.europa.eu/health/documents/eudralex/vol-4/index_en.htm GMP]. Their quality is controlled by the criteria and parameters of official pharmacopoeia (e.g. European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur.), German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia (GHP/HAB), French Pharmacopoeia (Ph.fr.), Pharmacopoeia Helvetica (Ph.Helv.), and the Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex (APC)".&lt;ref&gt;The System of Anthroposophic Medicine. IVAA (International Federation of Anthroposophic Medical Associations); 2011. Available from: http://www.ivaa.info/fileadmin/editor/file/System_AnthroposophicMedicine2011_online.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed pharmaceutical information for quality control and regulatory needs is provided in the Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex that is issued by the [https://archive.is/20130505151558/http://www.iaap.org.uk/pharmacy/ International Association of Anthroposophic Pharmacists] (IAAP), the umbrella organisation for the national professional anthroposophic pharmacists’ associations in Europe.

'''Arthur W. Galston''' (April 21, 1920 – June 15, 2008) was an American [[botany|botanist]] and [[bioethics|bioethicist]]. As a plant biologist, Galston studied the effects of light on plant development. He identified [[riboflavin]] and other flavins as photoreceptors involved in [[phototropism]], the bending of plants toward light, challenging the prevailing view that [[carotene]] was responsible.&lt;ref name="Whippo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whippo|first1=C. W.|title=Phototropism: Bending towards Enlightenment|journal=The Plant Cell Online|date=1 May 2006|volume=18|issue=5|pages=1110–1119|doi=10.1105/tpc.105.039669|pmid=16670442|accessdate=|pmc=1456868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[graduate student]] in 1943, Galston studied the use of 2,3,5-[[triiodobenzoic acid]] (TIBA) to encourage the flowering of soybeans, and noted that high levels had a defoliant effect. The [[British military|British]] and [[U.S. military]] later developed TIBA into [[Agent Orange]] which was employed extensively in [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. Galston became a bioethicist, and spoke out against such uses of science. As chairman of [[Yale University|Yale]]'s [[botany]] [[Academic department|department]], Galston's ethical objections led President Nixon to end the use of Agent Orange.

==Early life and education==
Galston was the youngest child of Hyman and Freda Galston.&lt;ref name="Debus"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Debus|editor-first1=Allen G.|title=World Who's Who in Science: A Biographical Dictionary of Notable Scientists from Antiquity to the Present|date=1968|publisher=Marquis-Who's Who, Inc.|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0837910017|page=628|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He grew up in a [[Jewish]] family in Brooklyn, impoverished during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; Inspired by doctors like  microbiologist [[Paul de Kruif]]&lt;ref name="Accidental"/&gt; but unable to afford [[medical school]], Galston enrolled at [[Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|Cornell's Agricultural College]] which was free for citizens of [[New York State]].&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; He played  [[saxophone]] in [[jazz]] and [[Swing music|swing]] bands to earn living expenses.&lt;ref name="ASPB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist"/&gt;

Galston's original intention was to attend [[Cornell Veterinary School]] after his freshman year.&lt;ref name="Accidental"/&gt; 
However, under the influence of botany professor Loren C. Petry he came to love botany,&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Galston |first=Arthur W.  |subjectlink =Arthur Galston |interviewer=Shirley K. Cohen |format=PDF |title=Oral History Project |publisher=California Institute of Technology Archives |type=interview |location=Pasadena, California |date=October 8, 2002 |accessdate=2014-02-10 |url=http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/150/1/Galston_OHO.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; turned down an acceptance to Cornell Veterinary School, and earned a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in botany from Cornell instead in 1940.&lt;ref name="Accidental"/&gt;

The [[University of Illinois]] offered Galston a [[teaching assistant]]ship for graduate work, so he went to [[Champaign-Urbana]] to study botany and [[biochemistry]]. He worked with plant physiologist [[Harry J. Fuller]] and botanist [[Oswald Tippo]]. Fuller, although nominally his advisor, was sent to South America on war-related research and was unavailable much of the time.&lt;ref name="Accidental"/&gt; Galston completed his M.Sc. in 1942 and his Ph.D. in 1943.&lt;ref name="Debus"/&gt; It was a wartime requirement that the doctorate be completed in three years.&lt;ref name="Accidental"/&gt;

Galston's  Ph.D. [[dissertation]] was titled ''Physiology of flowering, with especial reference to floral initiation in soybeans'' (1943).&lt;ref name="Galston"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Galston|first1=Arthur William|title=The physiology of flowering, with especial reference to floral initiation in soybeans Thesis (Ph.D.)|date=1943|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research focused on finding a chemical means to make [[soybean]]s [[flower]] and [[fruit]] earlier, so that they could mature before the end of the growing season.&lt;ref name="Schneider2003"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered both that 2,3,5-[[triiodobenzoic acid]] (TIBA) would speed up the flowering of soybeans. He also noted that in higher concentrations it would defoliate the soybeans&lt;ref name="Schneider2003" /&gt; by causing them to release [[ethylene]].&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news|title=Arthur Galston, botanist, died on June 15th, aged 88|url=http://www.economist.com/node/11613789|accessdate=19 April 2017|work=The Economist|date=June 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime service==
During [[World War II]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] captured most of the world's rubber plantations in [[British Malaya]], causing a natural rubber shortage for the Allied armies.
Natural rubber came from the rubber tree, [[Hevea brasiliensis]], a native of South America that was commercially grown in Southeast Asia.  The United States government established a research program to develop synthetic rubber, and also encouraged research into botanical alternatives. [[Parthenium argentatum|Guayule]], whose sap could be used to produce [[latex]], was considered a possible substitute for rubber.&lt;ref name="Finlay"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finlay|first1=Mark R.|title=Behind the Barbed Wire of Manzanar: Guayule and the Search for Natural Rubber|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|date=2011|volume=Fall 2011/Winter 2012|issue= |pages= |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/behind-the-barbed-wire-of-manzanar-guayule-and-the-search-for-natural-rubber|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Galston was recommended to [[James F. Bonner]] by [[H. E. Carter]], and spent a year working with Bonner at [[Caltech]] in [[Pasadena, California]] to develop rubber tires from [[Parthenium argentatum|guayule]].&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; By the end of 1944, the U.S. had achieved success with synthetic, petroleum-based rubber, and interest in guayule research lessened.&lt;ref name="Finlay"/&gt;

In July 1944, Galston was [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] as an [[enlisted man]]. He ultimately served as Natural Resources officer in [[United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands|Naval Military Government on Okinawa]] until his discharge in 1946.&lt;ref name="Accidental"&gt;{{cite journal

==Plant biology==
After a year as an instructor at [[Yale University]] in 1946-1947, Galston returned to the [[California Institute of Technology]] to work with James Bonner as a senior research fellow. While at Caltech, Galston made an important discovery.  He identified [[riboflavin]] as a photoreceptor involved in the bending of plants toward light. This overturned a commonly held belief that [[carotene]] was the photoreceptor involved in [[phototropism]].&lt;ref name="Whippo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Memoriam"/&gt;

In 1950 Galston accepted a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] to spend a year working with [[Hugo Theorell]] at the [[Karolinska Institute]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. Upon his return to Caltech in 1951, Galston became tenured as an associate professor. His supporters included Bonner and [[Frits Warmolt Went]], both of whom were senior plant biology researchers at Caltech. He co-taught classes in biology with [[George Beadle]], who was then chairman of the biology department.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

In 1955, Galston was offered a full professorship at [[Yale University]] by Oswald Tippo, chair of the botany department. In addition to a significant increase in salary and position, it was an opportunity for leadership in an expanding department.  Yale, in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], was also closer to family members in New York City and work opportunities for Galston's wife, Dale Judith Kuntz.  Galston accepted the offer, and taught at Yale from 1955 onwards.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

At Yale, Galston continued to do research in the areas of [[auxin]] physiology,&lt;ref name="Britz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Britz|first1=Steven J.|last2=Galston|first2=Arthur W.|title=Physiology of Movements in the Stems of Seedling Pisum sativum L. cv Alaska 1 III.

At Yale, increasing amounts of Galston's time were spent in administrative roles. He served as chair of the Departments of Botany and Biology, the university-wide Course of Study Committee, and the Committee on Teaching and Learning.  He was also director of the Biological Sciences Division. Following mandatory retirement from the biology department in 1990, he became the Eaton Professor Emeritus in the Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology as well as professor emeritus in the School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies. He continued to lecture and write after his retirement, in his second career as a bioethicist.&lt;ref name="Memoriam"&gt;{{cite news|title=In Memoriam: Arthur Galston, Plant Biologist, Fought Use of Agent Orange|url=http://news.yale.edu/2008/07/18/memoriam-arthur-galston-plant-biologist-fought-use-agent-orange|accessdate=19 April 2017|work=Yale News|date=July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He was president of the [[Botanical Society of America]] and of the [[American Society of Plant Physiologists]] (1962-1963).&lt;ref name="ASPB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Memoriam"/&gt;

Galston supervised 24 Ph.D. and 67 postdoctoral students from around the world.&lt;ref name="Memoriam"/&gt; He authored more than 320 papers and several books on plant physiology, as well as co-editing two books on bioethics.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Memoriam"/&gt;

==Bioethics==
[[File:2,3,5-Triiodobenzoic acid.svg|150px|thumbnail|2,3,5-Triiodobenzoic acid]]
In 1951, [[biological warfare]] scientists at [[Fort Detrick]], [[Maryland]] began investigating defoliants based upon Galston's Ph.D. discoveries with TIBA. They eventually produced the toxic defoliant Agent Orange used by the [[British Air Force]] during the [[Malayan Emergency]] and the [[U.S. Air Force]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="Schneider2003" /&gt;

Galston was deeply affected by this development of his research. In 1972, he described his viewpoint:&lt;ref name="Responsibility"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galston|first1=Arthur W.|title=Science and Social Responsibility: A Case History|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=1972|volume=196|issue=4 The social Re|page=223|url=http://beck2.med.harvard.edu/week13/Galston.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2017|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1972.tb21231.x|bibcode=1972NYASA.196..223G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I used to think that one could avoid involvement in the antisocial consequences of science simply by not working on any project that might be turned to evil or destructive ends.

In my view, the only recourse for a scientist concerned about the social consequences of his work is to remain involved with it to the end. His responsibility to society does not cease with publication of a definitive scientific paper. Rather, if his discovery is translated into some impact on the world outside the laboratory, he will, in most instances, want to follow through to see that it is used for constructive rather than anti-human purposes.... Science is now too potent in transforming our world to permit random fallout of the social consequences of scientific discoveries. Some  scrutiny and regulation are required, and I believe that scientists must play an important role in any bodies devised to carry out such tasks.&lt;ref name="Responsibility"/&gt;}}

While the United States government argued that [[herbicides]] like Agent Orange did not qualify as [[chemical weapon]]s, Galston asserted that their use was a violation of the United Nations Resolution of December 5, 1966 against the wartime use of “asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases” and “analogous liquids, materials or devices”.&lt;ref name="Responsibility"/&gt;  He was clear about the devastating impact of their use on the environment, and warned of the likelihood that they were harmful to animals and humans as well as plants. Galston visited [[Vietnam]] and China, viewing the environmental damage in Vietnam first-hand.&lt;ref name="Responsibility"/&gt;

{{quote|The  complex mangrove community lining the estuaries is virtually completely killed by a single spray with agent Orange and regeneration takes several decades, at least...

Beginning in 1965, Galston lobbied both his scientific colleagues and the government to stop using Agent Orange.&lt;ref name="Economist"/&gt;  
Galston and U.S. [[genetics|geneticist]] [[Matthew Meselson|Matthew S. Meselson]] appealed to the [[United States Department of Defense|U. S.

Nixon]] banning the use of the substance.&lt;ref name="Pearce2008" /&gt; Later research showed that Agent Orange contained high levels of [[teratogenic]] [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]].&lt;ref name="Responsibility"/&gt;

With [[Ethan Signer]] of MIT, Galston was one of the first two American scientists invited to visit the [[People's Republic of China]]. In 1971, he met [[Chou En-lai]], then Prime Minister, as well as [[King Norodom Sihanouk]] of [[Cambodia]], who then resided in [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name="Accidental"/&gt; The visit was reported in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Walter|title=2 U.S. Scientists Will Visit China|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/11/archives/2-u-s-scientists-will-visit-china-biologists-critical-of-war-said.html|accessdate=20 April 2017|work=The New York Times|date=May 11, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Return"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Walter|title=Two Returning Americans Cite Big Change in Chinese Science|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/1971/05/26/archives/two-returning-americans-cite-big-change-in-chinese-science.html|accessdate=20 April 2017|work=The New York Times|date=May 26, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmalzer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmalzer|first1=Sigrid|title=Speaking about China, Learning from China: Amateur China Experts in 1970s America|journal=The Journal of American-East Asian Relations|date=2009|volume=16|issue=4|pages=313–352|jstor=23613165|accessdate=|doi=10.1163/187656109792655526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galston's experiences on visits to China led him to write ''Daily life in people's China'' (1973).

Galston also co-founded the National Senior Conservation Corps (Grey is Green), a non-profit organization dedicated to helping older Americans to create positive environmental change and lead more sustainable lives.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of NSCC|url=http://www.kahsa.org/files/public/Spring09_Gray_Is_GreenNewsletterFinal.pdf|website=Gray Is  Green|publisher=4|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Galston successfully nominated [[Duke Ellington]] to receive an honorary doctorate from Yale. The Duke received the honor in 1967, but Galston was unable to attend, and did not meet him until 1972.&lt;ref name="Duke"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galston|first1=Arthur W.|title=The Duke &amp; I: A professor explains how jazz legend Duke Ellington became a doctor in 1967|url=http://archive.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/02_10/outoftheblue.html|accessdate=19 April 2017|work=Yale Alumni Magazine|date=October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied philosophy and sociology at the University of Sarajevo where he graduated in 1991. He earned his post-graduate degree from the same institution in 1998 with a thesis on the neopragmatism of Richard Rorty. In 2002 he earned his PhD with a thesis on the antiessentialist character of the philosophy of pragmatism. He was named Centennial Professor and head of the departament of philosophy at the [[Faculty of Political Science in Sarajevo]], lecturing on the subjects of introductory philosophy, ethics and political ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fpn.unsa.ba/bs/wp-content/uploads/syll/LJS-2015-16/K/BA-UVOD-U-FILOZOFIJU.pdf|title=Odsjek za filozofiju, sociologiju i politologiju|publisher=University of Sarajevo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the chairman of the Association of Bosnian political scientists, as well as the deputy editor-in-chief of the [[Odjek]] journal for the arts and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odjek.ba/index.php?broj=14&amp;id=15|title=UČO I EIRONIK|publisher=Odjek.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the founders of the [[Open University of Sarajevo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radiosarajevo.ba/metromahala/teme/uskoro-pocinje-sesti-otvoreni-univerzitet-sarajevo-pod-nazviom-sta-da-se-radi/280285|title=Uskoro počinje šesti Otvoreni univerzitet Sarajevo pod nazviom "Šta da se radi?"|publisher=Radio Sarajevo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cartesian Meditations: An Introduction to Phenomenology''''' ({{lang-fr|Méditations cartésiennes: Introduction à la phénoménologie}}) is a book by the philosopher [[Edmund Husserl]], based on four lectures he gave at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], in the Amphithéatre Descartes on February 23 and 25, 1929. Over the next two years, he and his assistant [[Eugen Fink]] expanded and elaborated on the text of these lectures. These expanded lectures were first published in a 1931 French translation by Gabrielle Peiffer&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; and [[Emmanuel Levinas]] with advice from [[Alexandre Koyré]].  They were published in German, along with the original ''Pariser Vortrage'', in 1950, and again in an English translation by Dorion Cairns in 1960, based on a typescript of the text (Typescript C) which Husserl had designated for Cairns in 1933.

The ''Cartesian Meditations'' were never published in German during Husserl's lifetime, a fact which has led some commentators to conclude that Husserl had become dissatisfied with the work in relation to its aim, namely an introduction to transcendental [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. The text introduces the main features of Husserl's mature transcendental phenomenology, including (not exhaustively) the transcendental reduction, the [[epoché]], static and genetic phenomenology, [[eidetic reduction]], and eidetic phenomenology.  In the Fourth Meditation, Husserl argues that transcendental phenomenology is nothing other than [[transcendental idealism]].
 
The name ''Cartesian Meditations'' refers to [[René Descartes|René Descartes']] ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]].'' Thus Husserl wrote:
{{quote
|France's greatest thinker, René Descartes, gave transcendental phenomenology new Impulses through his Meditations; their study acted quite directly on the transformation of an already developing phenomenology into a new kind of transcendental philosophy. Accordingly one might almost call transcendental phenomenology a neo-Cartesianism, even though It Is obliged — and precisely by its radical development of Cartesian motifs — to reject nearly all the well-known doctrinal content of the Cartesian philosophy.|[https://archive.org/stream/CartesiamMeditations/12813080-husserl-cartesian-meditations_djvu.txt]}}

==Contents==
The work is divided into five "meditations" of varying length, whose contents are as follows:
#First Meditation: The Way to the Transcendental Ego
#Second Meditation: The Field of Transcendental Experience
#Third Meditation: Constitutional Problems
#Fourth Meditation: Constitutional Problems Pertaining to the Transcendental Ego Itself
#Fifth Meditation: Transcendental Being as Monadological Intersubjectivity

{{Evolutionary biology}}
&lt;!-- NOTE: This article uses British English. Standard U.S. English drops the hyphen, resulting in "cooperation" or "cooperative." --&gt;
In [[evolution]], '''co-operation''' is the process where groups of organisms work or act together for common or mutual benefits. It is commonly defined as any [[adaptation]] that has evolved, at least in part, to increase the [[reproductive success]] of the actor's social partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Andy|last2=Griffin|first2=Ashleigh|last3=West|first3=Stuart|title=Theory of Cooperation|journal=eLS|date=December 2009 |doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0021910}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, territorial choruses by male [[lion]]s discourage intruders and are likely to benefit all contributors.&lt;ref name="Clutton-Brock 2009 51–57"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clutton-Brock|first=T|title=Cooperation between non-kin in animal societies|journal=Nature|date=5 November 2009|volume=462|issue=7269|pages=51–57|doi=10.1038/nature08366|bibcode=2009Natur.462...51C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process contrasts with intragroup competition where individuals work against each other for selfish reasons. Cooperation exists not only in humans but in other animals as well. The diversity of taxa that exhibits cooperation is quite large, ranging from [[zebra]] herds to pied [[Old World babbler|babblers]] to [[African elephants]]. Many animal and plant species cooperate with both members of their own species and with members of other species.

==In animals==

Cooperation in animals appears to occur mostly for direct benefit or between relatives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319508733|title=For whose benefit?

Since relatives share part of the helper's genetic make-up, enhancing each individual's chance of survival may actually increase the likelihood that the helper's genetic traits will be passed on to future generations.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W. D. | year = 1964 | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour.

However, some researchers, such as ecology professor Tim Clutton-Brock, assert that cooperation is a more complex process. They state that helpers may receive more direct, and less indirect, gains from assisting others than is commonly reported. These gains include protection from predation and increased reproductive fitness. Furthermore, they insist that cooperation may not solely be an interaction between two individuals but may be part of the broader goal of unifying populations.&lt;ref name="Clutton"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clutton-Brock | first1 = T. | year = 2002 | title = Breeding together: Kin selection and mutualism in cooperative vertebrates | url = | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5565| pages = 69–72 | doi = 10.1126/science.296.5565.69 | pmid=11935014| bibcode = 2002Sci...296...69C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent biologists, such as [[Charles Darwin]], [[E. O. Wilson]], and [[W. D. Hamilton]], have found the [[evolution of cooperation]] fascinating because [[natural selection]] favors those who achieve the greatest reproductive success while [[cooperative]] behavior often decreases the reproductive success of the actor (the individual performing the cooperative behavior). Hence, cooperation seemed to pose a challenging problem to the theory of natural selection, which rests on the assumption that individuals compete to survive and maximize their reproductive successes.&lt;ref name="Clutton-Brock 2009 51–57"/&gt; Additionally, some species have been found to perform cooperative behaviors that may at first sight seem detrimental to their own evolutionary fitness. For example, when a [[ground squirrel]] sounds an alarm call to warn other group members of a nearby coyote, it draws attention to itself and increases its own odds of being eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherman|first=P|title=Nepotism and the evolution of alarm calls|journal=Science|date=23 September 1977|volume=197|issue=4310|pages=1246–1253|doi=10.1126/science.197.4310.1246|pmid=17781971|bibcode=1977Sci...197.1246S}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been multiple hypotheses for the evolution of cooperation, all of which are rooted in Hamilton's models based on [[inclusive fitness]]. These models hypothesize that cooperation is favored by natural selection due to either direct fitness benefits (mutually beneficial cooperation) or indirect fitness benefits ([[Altruism (biology)#Implications in evolutionary theory|altruistic cooperation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=W|title=The genetical evolution of social behaviour. II |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |date=1 July 1964|volume=7|issue=1|pages=17–52|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90039-6|pmid=5875340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As explained below, direct benefits encompass by-product benefits and enforced reciprocity, while indirect benefits (kin selection) encompass limited dispersal, kin discrimination and the greenbeard effect.

=== Kin selection===
One specific form of cooperation in animals is kin selection, which involves animals promoting the reproductive success of their kin, thereby promoting their own fitness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clutton" /&gt;{{refn|1=An individual's gene complement (or genome) can be represented by the letters of the alphabet. Each letter is represented twice: A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This individual's genome therefore consists of 52 genes. The subscript indicates from which parent that copy of A has come. Mostly the two copies are identical, but occasionally they differ slightly.

When this individual reproduces sexually, one or other copy of A (chosen randomly) is passed on to offspring-1, who gets its other copy of A from the sexual partner. The same happens with genes B, C, D, ..., Z. If we denote the two sexual partners by means of subscripts "m" and "f", then the genome of the offspring they produce might consist of A&lt;sub&gt;m2&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;f1&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;m2&lt;/sub&gt;/B&lt;sub&gt;f2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;m1&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;f1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;m1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;f1&lt;/sub&gt; ... Z&lt;sub&gt;m1&lt;/sub&gt;/Z&lt;sub&gt;f2&lt;/sub&gt;. Each parent has contributed exactly half of the offspring's genome. So individual "m" shares only half of its genome with its offspring.
Suppose individuals "m" and "f" produce a second offspring (offspring-2), whose genome is determined in exactly the same manner. There is a coin-flip 50% probability that offspring-2 will inherit the same copy of A from "m" as offspring-1 did (i.e. A&lt;sub&gt;m2&lt;/sub&gt;). This also applies to gene B and so on through the alphabet. If a coin-flip "heads" means that gene X is the same in offspring-1 as it is in offspring-2, then in 26 flips of the coin approximately half are going to be "heads" and the rest "tails", i.e. half the genes inherited from parent "m" will be the same in the two offspring. The same will happen to the genes inherited from parent "f". Thus of the 52 genes inherited from the two parents, on average, 13&amp;nbsp;+ &amp;nbsp;13&amp;nbsp;= &amp;nbsp;26 (or half) will be identical in the two sibs.
Thus sibs are genetically as similar to one another as a parent is to an offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Grafen, A. (1984) Natural selection, kin selection and group selection. In Krebs, J. R. &amp; Davies, N. B. (Eds.) ''Behavioural Ecology. An Evolutionary Approach.'' (p. 70-71).

Different theories explaining kin selection have been proposed, including the "pay-to-stay" and "territory inheritance" hypotheses. The "pay-to-stay" theory suggests that individuals help others rear offspring in order to return the favor of the breeders allowing them to live on their land. The "territory inheritance" theory contends that individuals help in order to have improved access to breeding areas once the breeders depart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balshine-Earn | first1 = S. | last2 = Neat | first2 = F.C. | last3 = Reid | first3 = H. | last4 = Taborsky | first4 = M. | year = 1998 | title = Paying to stay or paying to breed?

Studies conducted on red wolves support previous researchers' contention that helpers obtain both immediate and long-term gains from cooperative breeding.&lt;ref name="Clutton" /&gt; Researchers evaluated the consequences of red wolves' decisions to stay with their packs for extended periods of time after birth. While delayed dispersal helped other wolves' offspring, studies also found that it extended male helper wolves' life spans. This suggests that kin selection may not only benefit an individual in the long-term through increased fitness but also in the short-term through increased survival chances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sparkman | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Adams | first2 = J. R. | last3 = Steury | first3 = T. D. | last4 = Waits | first4 = L. P. | last5 = Murray | first5 = D.

Some research suggests that individuals provide more help to closer relatives. This phenomenon is known as kin discrimination.&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Griffin | first1 = A. S. | last2 = West | first2 = S. A. | year = 2003 | title = Kin Discrimination and the Benefit of Helping in Cooperatively Breeding Vertebrates | url = | journal = Science | volume = 302 | issue = 5645| pages = 634–636 | doi = 10.1126/science.1089402 | pmid=14576431| bibcode = 2003Sci...302..634G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their meta-analysis, researchers compiled data on kin selection as mediated by genetic relatedness in 18 species, including the [[western bluebird]], [[pied kingfisher]], [[Australian magpie]], and [[dwarf mongoose]]. They found that different species exhibited varying degrees of kin discrimination, with the largest frequencies occurring among those who have the most to gain from cooperative interactions.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

== In plants ==

Cooperation exists not only in animals but also in plants. In a greenhouse experiment with ''Ipomoea hederacea'', a climbing plant, results show that kin groups have higher efficiency rates in growth than non-kin groups do. This is expected to rise out of reduced competition within the kin groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biernaskie|first=J. M.|title=Evidence for competition and cooperation among climbing plants|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|year=2011|volume=278|issue=1714|pages=1989–96|doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.1771|pmid=21147795|pmc=3107641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==
The inclusive fitness theory provides a good overview of possible solutions to the fundamental problem of cooperation. The theory is based on the hypothesis that cooperation helps in transmitting underlying genes to future generations either through increasing the reproductive successes of the individual (direct fitness) or of other individuals who carry the same genes (indirect fitness).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Direct benefits can result from simple by-product of cooperation or enforcement mechanisms, while indirect benefits can result from cooperation with genetically similar individuals.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt;

=== Direct fitness benefits ===

This is also called mutually beneficial cooperation as both actor and recipient depend on direct fitness benefits, which are broken down into two different types: [[Byproduct|by-product benefit]] and [[enforcement]].

By-product benefit arises as a consequence of social partners having a shared interest in cooperation. For example, in meerkats, larger group size provides a benefit to all the members of that group by increasing survival rates, foraging success and conflict wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clutton-Brock|first=T |author2=Brotherton, P. N. |author3=Russell, A. F. |author4=O'Riain, M. J. |author5=Gaynor, D. |author6=Kansky, R. |author7=Griffin, A. |author8=Manser, M. |author9=Sharpe, L. |author10=McIlrath, G. M. |author11=Small, T. |author12=Moss, A. |author13=Monfort, S. |title=Cooperation, control, and concession in meerkat groups|journal=Science|year=2001|volume=291|issue=5503|pages=478–481|doi=10.1126/science.291.5503.478 |pmid=11161200|bibcode=2001Sci...291..478C}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because living in groups is better than living alone, and cooperation arises passively as a result of many animals doing the same thing. By-product benefit can also arise as a consequence of subordinate animals staying and helping a nest that is dominated by leaders who often suffer high mortality rates. It has been shown that cooperation would be most advantageous for the sex that is more likely to remain and breed in the natal group. This is because the subordinate will have a higher chance to become dominant in the group as time passes. Cooperation in this scenario is often seen between non-related members of the same species, such as the wasp ''[[Polistes dominula]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strassmann|first=J |author2=Seppa, P. |author3=Queller, D. C. |title=Absence of within-colony kin discrimination: foundresses of the social wasp, ''Polistes carolina'', do not prefer their own larvae|journal=Naturwissenschaften|date=10 August 2000|volume=87|issue=6|pages=266–269|doi=10.1007/s001140050718|pmid=10929290|bibcode=2000NW.....87..266S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prisoner's Delight''', another term to describe '''by-product benefit''', is a term coined by [[Kenneth Binmore]] in 2007 after he found that benefits can result as an automatic consequence of an otherwise "self-interested" act in [[cooperative hunting]]. He illustrated this with a scenario having two hunters, each hunter having the choice of hunting (cooperate) or not hunting (free-riding). Assuming that cooperative hunting results in greater rewards than just a one-player hunt, when hunting is not rare, both hunters and non-hunters benefit because either player is likely to be with other hunters, and thus likely to reap the rewards of a successful hunt. This situation demonstrates "Prisoner's Delight" because the food of a successful hunt is shared between the two players regardless of whether or not they participated.&lt;ref name="Behavioral Ecology 2012"&gt;''An Introduction to Behavioral Ecology''. Davies, Nicholas B., John R. Krebs, and Stuart A. West. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that [[free riding]], or reaping the benefits without any effort, is often a problem in collective action. Examples of free riding would be if an employee in a labor union pays no dues, but still benefits from union representation. In a study published in 1995, scientists found that [[Panthera leo|female lions]] showed individual differences in the extent to which they participated in group-territorial conflict. Some lions consistently 'cooperated' by approaching intruders, while others 'lagged' behind to avoid the risk of fighting. Although the lead female recognized the laggards, she failed to punish them, suggesting that cooperation is not maintained by reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heinsohn|first=R|author2=Packer, C.|title=Complex cooperative strategies in group-territorial African lions|journal=Science|date=1 September 1995|volume=269|issue=5228|pages=1260–1262|doi=10.1126/science.7652573|pmid=7652573|bibcode=1995Sci...269.1260H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooperation is maintained in situations where [[Free rider problem|free-riding]] is a problem through enforcement, which is the mechanism where the actor is rewarded for cooperating or punished for not cooperating. This happens when cooperation is favored in aiding those who have helped the actors in the past. Punishment for noncooperation has been documented in [[meerkats]], where dominant females will attack and evict subordinate females who become pregnant. The pregnancy is seen as a failure to cooperate because only the dominant females are allowed to bear offspring. Dominant females will attack and kill the offspring of subordinate females if they evade [[eviction]] and eviction often leads to increased stress and decreased survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norris|first=Scott|title=Murderous Meerkat Moms Contradict Caring Image, Study Finds|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/03/0315_060315_meerkats.html|publisher=National Geographic News|accessdate=20 November 2013|date=15 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcement can also be mutually beneficial, and is often called [[Reciprocal altruism|reciprocal cooperation]] because the act of cooperation is preferentially directed at individuals who have helped the actor in the past (directly), or helped those who have helped the actor in the past (indirectly).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Andy|author2=Ashleigh S Griffin |author3=Stuart A West |title=Theory of Cooperation|journal=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences|year=2009|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indirect fitness benefits ===
The second class of explanations for cooperation is indirect fitness benefits, or [[Altruism (biology)|altruistic]] cooperation. There are three major mechanisms that generate this type of fitness benefit: [[Biological dispersal|limited dispersal]], [[kin discrimination]] and the [[green-beard effect]].

Hamilton originally suggested that high relatedness could arise in two ways: direct kin recognition between individuals or limited dispersal, or population viscosity, which can keep relatives together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kummerli|first=Rolf|author2=Andy Gardner |author3=Stuart A. West |author4=Ashleigh S. Griffin |title=Limited Dispersal, Budding Dispersal, and Cooperation: An Experimental Study|journal=Evolution|date=April 2009|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00548.x |volume=63 |pages=939–949 |pmid=19154373}}&lt;/ref&gt; The easiest way to generate relatedness between social partners is limited dispersal, a mechanism in which genetic similarity correlates with spatial proximity. If individuals do not move far, then kin usually surrounds them. Hence, any act of altruism would be directed primarily towards kin. This mechanism has been shown in ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' bacteria, where cooperation is disfavored when populations are well mixed, but favored when there is high local relatedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffin|first=A |author2=West, S. A. |author3=Buckling, A. |title=Cooperation and competition in pathogenic bacteria|journal=Nature|date=28 August 2004|volume=430|issue=7003|pages=1024–1027|doi=10.1038/nature02744 |pmid=15329720|bibcode=2004Natur.430.1024G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kin discrimination also influences cooperation because the actor can give aid preferentially towards related partners. Since kin usually share common genes, it is thought that this nepotism can lead to genetic relatedness between the actor and the partner's offspring, which affects the cooperation an actor might give.

This mechanism is similar to what happens with the [[green-beard effect]], but with the green-beard effect, the actor has to instead identify which of its social partners share the gene for cooperation. A green-beard system must always co-occur within individuals and alleles to produce a perceptible trait, recognition of this trait in others, and preferential treatment to those recognized. Examples of green-beard behavior have been found in [[hydrozoans]], [[slime molds]], [[yeast]], and [[ants]]. An example is in [[Uta stansburiana|side-blotch lizards]], where blue-throated males preferentially establish territories next to each other. Results show that neighboring blue-throats are more successful at mate guarding. However, blue males next to larger, more aggressive orange males suffer a cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinervo|first=Barry |author2=Alexis Chaine |author3=Jean Clobert |author4=Ryan Calsbeek |author5=Lisa Hazard |author6=Lesley Lancaster |author7=Andrew G. McAdam |author8=Suzanne Alonzo |author9=Gwynne Corrigan |author10=Michael E. Hochberg |title=Self-recognition, color signals, and cycles of greenbeard mutualism and altruism|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=1 May 2006|volume=103|issue=19|pages=7372–7377|doi=10.1073/pnas.0510260103|pmid=16651531|pmc=1564281|bibcode=2006PNAS..103.7372S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multi-level selection ==
{{main|Multi-level selection}}
Multi-level selection theory suggests that selection operates on more than one level: for example, it may operate at an atomic and molecular level in cells, at the level of cells in the body, and then again at the whole organism level, and the community level, and the species level. Any level which is not competitive with others of the same level will be eliminated, even if the level below is highly competitive. A classic example is that of genes which prevent [[cancer]]. Cancer cells divide uncontrollably, and at the cellular level, they are very successful, because they are (in the short term) reproducing very well and out competing other cells in the body. However, at the whole organism level, cancer is often fatal, and so may prevent reproduction. Therefore, changes to the genome which prevent cancer (for example, by causing damaged cells to act co-operatively by destroying themselves) are favoured. Multi-level selection theory contends that similar effects can occur, for example, to cause individuals to co-operate to avoid behaviours which favour themselves short-term, but destroy the community (and their descendants) long term.

== Market effect ==
One theory suggesting a mechanism that could lead to the evolution of co-operation is the "market effect" as suggested by Noe and Hammerstein.&lt;ref name= "Noe &amp; Hammerstein, 1994"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00167053 | last1 = Noe | first1 = R. | last2 = Hammerstein | first2 = P. | year = 1994 | title = Biological markets: supply and demand determine the effect of partner choice in cooperation, mutualism and mating | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism relies on the fact that in many situations there exists a [[trade-off]] between efficiency obtaining a desired resource and the amount of resources one can actively obtain. In that case, each partner in a system could benefit from specializing in producing one specific resource and obtaining the other resource by [[trade]]. When only two partners exist, each can specialize in one [[Resource (economics)|resource]], and trade for the other. Trading for the resource requires co-operation with the other partner and includes a process of bidding and bargaining.

This mechanism can be relied to both within a species or social group and within species systems. It can also be applied to a multi-partner system, in which the owner of a resource has the power to choose its co-operation partner. This model can be applied in natural systems (examples exist in the world of apes, cleaner fish, and more). Easy for exemplifying, though, are systems from international trading. Arabic countries control vast amounts of oil, but seek technologies from western countries. These in turn are in need of Arab oil. The solution is co-operation by trade.

== Symbiosis ==
[[Symbiosis]] refers to two or more biological species that interact closely, often over a long period of time. Symbiosis includes three types of interactions—[[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[commensalism]], and [[parasitism]]—of which only mutualism can sometimes qualify as cooperation. Mutualism involves a close, mutually beneficial interaction between two different biological species, whereas "cooperation" is a more general term that can involve looser interactions and can be interspecific (between species) or intraspecific (within a species). In commensalism, one of the two participating species benefits, while the other is neither harmed nor benefitted. In parasitism, one of the two participating species benefits at the expense of the other.

Symbiosis may be obligate or facultative. In obligate symbiosis, one or both species depends on the other for survival. In facultative symbiosis, the symbiotic interaction is not necessary for the survival of either species.

Two special types of symbiosis include [[endosymbiont|endosymbiosis]], in which one species lives inside of another, and ectosymbiosis, in which one species lives on another.

=== Mutualism ===
[[File:Rhizobia nodules on Vigna unguiculata.jpg|thumb|[[Rhizobia]] nodules on ''[[Vigna unguiculata]]'']]

[[Mutualism (biology)|Mutualism]] is a form of symbiosis in which both participating species benefit.

A classic example of mutualism is the interaction between [[rhizobia]] soil bacteria and legumes ([[Fabaceae]]). In this interaction, rhizobia bacteria induce root nodule formation in legume plants via an exchange of molecular signals.&lt;ref name="Advances in Agronomy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=F|last2=Smith|first2=D. L |year=2002 |title=Interorganismal signaling in suboptimum environments: The legume-rhizobia symbiosis |journal=Advances in Agronomy |volume=76 |pages=125–161 |doi=10.1016/S0065-2113(02)76004-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the root nodules, rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia using the [[nitrogenase]] enzyme. The legume benefits from a new supply of usable nitrogen from the rhizobia, and the rhizobia benefits from organic acid energy sources from the plant as well as the protection provided by the root nodule. Since the rhizobia live within the legume, this is an example of endosymbiosis, and since both the bacteria and the plant can survive independently, it is also an example of facultative symbiosis.

[[Lichen]]s are another example of mutualism. Lichens consist of a [[fungus]] (the mycobiont) and a photosynthetic partner (the photobiont), which is usually a [[green alga]] or a [[cyanobacteria]]. The mycobiont benefits from the sugar products of [[photosynthesis]] generated by the photobiont, and the photobiont benefits from the increased water retention and increased surface area to capture water and mineral nutrients conferred by the mycobiont. Many lichens are examples of obligate symbiosis. In fact, one-fifth of all known extant fungal species form obligate symbiotic associations with green algae, cyanobacteria or both.&lt;ref name="Lichens"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lutzoni|first1=François|last2=Pagel|first2=Mark|last3=Reeb|first3=Valérie |year=2001 |title=Major fungal lineages are derived from lichen symbiotic ancestors |journal=Nature |volume=411 |issue=6840 |pages=937–940 |doi=10.1038/35082053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all examples of mutualism are also examples of cooperation. Specifically, in by-product mutualism, both participants benefit, but cooperation is not involved. For example, when an elephant defecates, this is beneficial to the elephant as a way to empty waste, and it is also beneficial to a dung beetle that uses the elephant's dung. However, neither participant's behavior yields a benefit from the other, and thus cooperation is not taking place.&lt;ref name="Elephant Dung"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Connor |first1=R. C. |title=Cooperation beyond the dyad: on simple models and a complex society |year=2010 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=365 |issue=1553 |pages=2687–2697 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0150 |pmid=20679112 |pmc=2936175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hidden benefits ==

'''Hidden benefits''' are benefits from cooperation that are not obvious because they are obscure or delayed. (For example, a hidden benefit would not involve an increase in the number of offspring or offspring viability.)

One example of a hidden benefit involves ''Malarus cyaneus'', the [[superb fairy-wren]]. In ''M. cyaneus'', the presence of helpers at the nest does not lead to an increase in chick mass. However, the presence of helpers does confer a hidden benefit: it increases the chance that a mother will survive to breed in the next year.&lt;ref name="Behavioral Ecology 2012"/&gt;

Another example of a hidden benefit is indirect reciprocity, in which a donor individual helps a beneficiary to increase the probability that observers will invest in the donor in the future, even when the donor will have no further interaction with the beneficiary.

In a study of 79 students, participants played a game in which they could repeatedly give money to others and receive from others. They were told that they would never interact with the same person in the reciprocal role. A player's history of donating was displayed at each anonymous interaction, and donations were significantly more frequent to receivers who had been generous to others in earlier interactions.&lt;ref name="Cooperation Through Image Scoring"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wedekind|first1=C. |year=2000 |title=Cooperation Through Image Scoring in Humans |journal=Science|volume=288 |issue=5467 |pages=850–852 |doi=10.1126/science.288.5467.850 |pmid=10797005|bibcode=2000Sci...288..850W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect reciprocity has only been shown to occur in humans.&lt;ref name="Behavioural Processes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bergmüller|first1=Ralph|last2=Johnstone|first2=Rufus A.|last3=Russell|first3=Andrew F.|last4=Bshary|first4=Redouan |year=2007 |title=Integrating cooperative breeding into theoretical concepts of cooperation |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=61–72 |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2007.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prisoner's dilemma==
{{main|Prisoner's dilemma}}

[[Image:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|Cooperative hunting by wolves allows them to tackle much larger and more nutritious prey than any individual wolf could handle. However, such cooperation could, potentially, be exploited by selfish individuals who do not expose themselves to the dangers of the hunt, but nevertheless share in the spoils.]]
Even if all members of a group benefit from cooperation, individual self-interest may not favor cooperation. The [[prisoner's dilemma]] codifies this problem and has been the subject of much research, both theoretical and experimental. In its original form the prisoner's dilemma game (PDG) described two awaiting trial prisoners, A and B, each faced with the choice of betraying the other or remaining silent. The "[[Game theory|game]]" has four possible outcomes: (a) they both betray each other, and are both sentenced to two years in prison; (b) A betrays B, which sets A free and B is sentenced to four years in prison; (c) B betrays A, with the same result as (b) except that it is B who is set free and the other spends four years in jail; (d) both remain silent, resulting in a six-month sentence each. Clearly (d) ("cooperation") is the best mutual strategy, but from the point of view of the individual betrayal is unbeatable (resulting in being set free, or getting only a two-year sentence). Remaining silent results in a four-year or six-month sentence. This is exemplified by a further example of the PDG: two strangers attend a restaurant together and decide to split the bill. The mutually best ploy would be for both parties to order the cheapest items on the menu (mutual cooperation). But if one member of the party exploits the situation by ordering the most expensive items, then it is best for the other member to do likewise. In fact, if the fellow diner's personality is completely unknown, and the two diners are unlikely ever to meet again, it is always in one's own best interests to eat as expensively as possible. Situations in nature that are subject to the same dynamics (rewards and penalties) as the PDG define cooperative behavior: it is never in the individual's fitness interests to cooperate, even though mutual cooperation rewards the two contestants (together) more highly than any other strategy.&lt;ref name=sigmund&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sigmund|first1 =K.|title=Games of Life.|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=|pages=180–206|url= |chapter= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nash equilibrium#Prisoner's dilemma|Cooperation cannot evolve under these circumstances]].

However, in 1981 [[Robert Axelrod|Axelrod]] and [[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton]]&lt;ref name=axelrod&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.7466396|last1=Axelrod |first1=R.|last2=Hamilton|first2=W.D.|year = 1981 | title = The evolution of cooperation|url = | journal = Science |volume = 211 | issue =|pages = 1390–1396 |pmid = 7466396| bibcode=1981Sci...211.1390A}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that if the same contestants in the PDG meet repeatedly (in the so-called iterated prisoner's dilemma game, IPD) then tit-for-tat (foreshadowed by [[Robert Trivers]]' 1971 reciprocal altruism theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1086/406755|last=Trivers|first= R.L.|year=1971|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology| volume= 46|pages= 35–57|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a robust strategy which promotes altruism.&lt;ref name=sigmund /&gt;&lt;ref name=axelrod /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard Smith|first1 =J.|title=Evolutionary Genetics|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198542151|pages=168–169, 181–183|url= |chapter=Evolution in structured populations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "tit-for-tat" both players' opening moves are cooperation. Thereafter each contestant repeats the other player's last move, resulting in a seemingly endless sequence of mutually cooperative moves. However, mistakes severely undermine tit-for-tat's effectiveness, giving rise to prolonged sequences of betrayal, which can only be rectified by another mistake. Since these initial discoveries, all the other possible IPD game strategies have been identified (16 possibilities in all, including, for instance, "generous tit-for-tat", which behaves like "tit-for-tat", except that it cooperates with a small probability when the opponent's last move was "betray".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Godfray, H.

Results from [[experimental economics]] show, however, that humans often act more cooperatively than strict self-interest would dictate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=van den Assem | author2=van Dolder | author3=Thaler | title=''Split or Steal''?

==Evolutionary mechanisms suggesting that reciprocity is the result, not the cause, of the evolution of cooperation ==
In the light of the iterated prisoner's dilemma game and the reciprocal altruism theory failing to provide full answers to the evolutionary stability of cooperation, several alternative explanations have been proposed.
[[File:Paonroue.JPG|thumb|left|300px|A male peacock with its beautiful but clumsy, aerodynamically unsound erectile tail, which [[Amotz Zahavi]] believes is a handicap, comparable to a race horse's handicap. The larger the handicap the more intrinsically fit the individual (see text).]]
[[File:Curlin in the Final Turn in the 2008 Stephen Foster Handicap (2972085393).jpg|thumb|right|300px|The best horses in a [[Handicap (horse racing)|handicap race]] carry the largest weights, so the size of the handicap is a measure of the animal's quality.]]

There are striking parallels between cooperative behavior and exaggerated [[Sexual selection|sexual ornaments]] displayed by some animals, particularly certain birds, such as, amongst others, the [[Peafowl|peacock]]. Both are costly in fitness terms, and both are generally conspicuous to other members of the population or species. This led [[Amotz Zahavi]] to suggest that both might be [[Signalling theory|fitness signals]] rendered evolutionarily stable by his [[handicap principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1975 |title=Mate selection—a selection for a handicap |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=205–214 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3 |pmid=1195756}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zahavi&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1977 |title=The cost of honesty (Further remarks on the handicap principle) |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=603–605 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(77)90061-3 |pmid=904334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1997 |title=The handicap principle: a missing piece of Darwin's puzzle |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-510035-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a signal is to remain reliable, and generally resistant to falsification, [[Signalling theory#The sports handicapping metaphor|the signal]] has to be evolutionarily costly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grafen |first=A. |year=1990 |title=Biological signals as handicaps |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=144 |issue=4 |pages=517–546 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80088-8 |pmid=2402153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if a (low fitness) liar were to use the highly costly signal, which seriously eroded its real fitness, it would find it difficult to maintain a semblance or normality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnstone |first=RA |first2=A |last2=Grafen |year=1993 |title=Dishonesty and the handicap principle |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=759–764 |doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zahavi borrowed the term "handicap principle" from sports handicapping systems. These systems are aimed at reducing disparities in performance, thereby making the outcome of contests less predictable. In a horse [[Handicap (horse racing)|handicap race]], provenly faster horses are given heavier weights to carry under their saddles than inherently slower horses. Similarly, in [[Golf handicap|amateur golf]], better golfers have fewer strokes subtracted from their raw scores than the less talented players. The handicap therefore correlates with unhandicapped performance, making it possible, if one knows nothing about the horses, to predict which unhandicapped horse would win an open race. It would be the one handicapped with the greatest weight in the saddle. The handicaps in nature are highly visible, and therefore a peahen, for instance, would be able to deduce the health of a potential mate by comparing its handicap (the size of the peacock's tail) with those of the other males. The loss of the male's fitness caused by the handicap is offset by his increased access to females, which is as much of a fitness concern as is his health. A cooperative act is, by definition, similarly costly (e.g. helping raise the young at the nest of an unrelated pair of birds versus producing and raising one's own offspring). It would therefore also signal fitness, and is probably as attractive to females as a physical handicap. If this is the case, cooperation is evolutionarily stabilized by [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name=zahavi /&gt;

There is an alternate strategy for identifying fit mates which does not rely on one gender having exaggerated sexual ornaments or other handicaps, but is probably generally applicable to most, if not all sexual creatures. It derives from the concept that the change in appearance and functionality caused by a [[Silent mutation|non-silent]] [[mutation]] will generally stand out in a population. This is because that altered appearance and functionality will be unusual, peculiar, and different from the norm within that population. The norm against which these unusual features are judged is made up of fit attributes that have attained their plurality through [[natural selection]], while less well adapted attributes will be in the minority or frankly rare.&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;Fisher R. (1930) ''The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the overwhelming majority of mutant features are maladaptive, and it is impossible to predict evolution's future direction, sexual creatures would be expected to [[Koinophilia|prefer mates with the least number of unusual or minority features]].&lt;ref name=fisher /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Symons, D.

They will all very quickly begin to look remarkably similar to one another in every detail, as illustrated in the accompanying photograph of the [[African pygmy kingfisher]], ''Ispidina picta''. Once a population has become as homogeneous in appearance as is typical of most species, its entire repertoire of behaviors will also be rendered [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily stable]], including any cooperative, altruistic and social interactions. Thus, in the example [[Co-operation (evolution)#The Prisoner's Dilemma|above]] of the selfish individual who hangs back from the rest of the hunting pack, but who nevertheless joins in the spoils, that individual will be recognized as being different from the norm, and will therefore find it difficult to attract a mate ([[koinophilia]]).&lt;ref name= "Koeslag, 1990" /&gt; Its genes will therefore have only a very small probability of being passed on to the next generation, thus evolutionarily stabilizing cooperation and social interactions at whatever level of complexity is the norm in that population.&lt;ref name=koeslag1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0022-5193(03)00188-7|last1 = Koeslag|first1 = J.H.| year = 2003 |title = Evolution of cooperation: cooperation defeats defection in the cornfield model |url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology| volume = 224 |issue = | pages = 399–410 |pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of cooperation research ==

One of the first references to animal cooperation was made by [[Charles Darwin]], who noted it as a potential problem for his theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. ''The Origin of Species'' Ch VIII (The Modern Library, 1859/1958)&lt;/ref&gt; In most of the 19th century, intellectuals like [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]] debated fervently on whether animals cooperate with one another and whether animals displayed altruistic behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dugatkin | first1 = L. A. | year = 2002 | title = Animal cooperation among unrelated individuals | doi = 10.1007/s00114-002-0379-y | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 89 | issue = 12| pages = 533–41 | bibcode = 2002NW.....89..533D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1900s, some early research in animal cooperation focused on the benefits of group-living. While living in a group produces costs in the form of increased frequency of predator attacks and greater mating competition, some animals find that the benefits outweigh the costs. Animals that practice group-living often benefit from assistance in parasite removal, access to more mates, and conservation of energy in foraging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alexander | first1 = R. | year = 1974 | title = The evolution of social behavior | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 325–83 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.05.110174.001545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the most obvious form of animal cooperation was [[Cooperation#Kin selection|kin selection]], but more recent studies focus on non-kin cooperation, where benefits may seem less obvious. Non-kin cooperation often involves many strategies that include manipulation and coercion, making these interactions more complicated to study.&lt;ref name="Clutton-Brock 2009 51–57" /&gt; An example of manipulation is presented by the cuckoo, a [[brood parasite]], which lays its eggs in the nest of a bird of another species.&lt;ref name="Behavioral Ecology 2012"/&gt; That bird then is tricked into feeding and caring for the cuckoo offspring. Although this phenomenon may look like cooperation at first glance, it only presents benefits to one recipient.

In the past, simple [[game theory]] models, such as the classic cooperative hunting and [[Prisoner's dilemma]] models, were used to determine decisions made by animals in cooperative relationships. However, complicated interactions between animals have required the use of more complex economic models such as the [[Nash equilibrium]]. The [[Nash equilibrium]] is a type of non-cooperative game theory that assumes an individual's decision is influenced by its knowledge of the strategies of other individuals. This theory was novel because it took into consideration the higher cognitive capabilities of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Noë, R., van Hooff, J., and Hammerstein, P. ''Economics in Nature: Social Dilemmas, Mate Choice and Biological Markets'' Cambridge University Press (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mesterton-Gibbons | first1 = M. | last2 = Adams | first2 = E.S. | year = 2002 | title = The Economics of Animal Cooperation | url = | journal = Science | volume = 298 | issue = 5601| pages = 2146–7 | doi=10.1126/science.1080051}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] is a refined version of the [[Nash equilibrium]] in that it assumes strategies are heritable and are subject to natural selection. Economic models are useful for analyzing cooperative relationships because they provide predictions on how individuals act when cooperation is an option. Economic models are not perfect, but they provide a general idea of how cooperative relationships work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1762">The '''container theory of space''' is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory according to which [[space]] is a background against which objects rest and move, with the implication that it can continue to exist in the absence of matter. Its opposite is the [[relational space|relational]] theory. [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] favoured [[absolute time and space]] and the container theory, against [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] who was a relationist. The subject was famously debated in the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]].&lt;ref&gt;''Space and Subtle Matter in Descartes's Metaphysics'' by Bennett, Jonathan, ''New Essays on the Rationalists,'' February 2003 , pp. 3-26(24) Oxford Scholarship Online Monographs [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oso/427006/2003/00000001/00000001/art00002]&lt;/ref&gt;

At first glance, the [[Physics|physical]] [[theory of relativity]] weighs in favour of relational space, but the [[general theory of relativity]] re-introduces some container-like features such as the possibility of completely empty universes.&lt;ref&gt;"The Metaphysics of Space-Time Substantivalism" by Carl Hoefer, ''The Journal of Philosophy,'' Vol. 93, No. 1 (Jan., 1996), pp. 5-27, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2941016 available at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

An absolute approach can also be applied to [[time]], with, for instance, the implication that there might have been vast epochs of time before the first [[event (philosophy)|event]].&lt;ref&gt; ''Physics and Metaphysics: Theories of Space and Time'' by Jennifer Trusted, Routledge, 1991 {{ISBN|0-415-05948-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evil''', in a general sense, is the opposite or absence of [[good]]. It can be an extremely broad concept, though in everyday usage is often used more narrowly to denote profound [[wickedness]]. It is generally seen as taking multiple possible forms, such as the form of personal [[moral evil]] commonly associated with the word, or impersonal [[natural evil]] (as in the case of natural disasters or illnesses), and in religious thought, the form of the demonic or supernatural/eternal.&lt;ref&gt;David Ray Griffin, ''God, Power, and Evil: a Process Theodicy'' (Westminster, 1976/2004), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evil can denote profound [[immorality]]&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary Definition"&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |title=Evil |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/evil}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but typically not without some basis in the understanding of the [[human condition]], where [[wikt:strife|strife]] and [[suffering]] (cf. [[Hinduism]]) are the true roots of evil.  In certain religious contexts, evil has been described as a [[supernatural]] force.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary Definition"/&gt; As defined in [[philosophy]]{{fact|date=July 2018}} it can be the name for the [[psychology]] and [[instinct]] of individuals which [[selfish]]ly but often necessarily [[Defence mechanism|defends]] the personal boundary against deadly attacks and serious threats. Definitions of evil vary, as does the analysis of its motives.&lt;ref&gt;Ervin Staub. ''Overcoming evil: genocide, violent conflict, and terrorism''. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Elements that are commonly associated with personal forms of evil involve [[Balance (metaphysics)|unbalanced]] behavior involving [[anger]], [[revenge]], [[fear]], [[hatred]], [[psychological trauma]], expediency, [[selfishness]], [[ignorance]], or [[neglect]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Matthews, John Matthews. ''Walkers Between the Worlds: The Western Mysteries from Shaman to Magus''. Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co, Jan 14, 2004. p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evil is sometimes perceived as the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] antagonistic [[Binary opposition|binary opposite]] to [[good]],&lt;ref name="PA131 pp.136-7"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kf9err5bmr4C&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=history+yehud+2008&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LGmPdldLsV&amp;sig=QIbpDXAPWb0nu2lOKXq5o636nuU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qAMBTNrHBYmlceLa6NUB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwATge#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20yehud%202008&amp;f=false Izaak J. de Hulster, "Iconographic Exegesis and Third Isaiah", pp.136-7]&lt;/ref&gt; in which good should prevail and evil should be defeated.&lt;ref name="Paul O.

University of Hawaii Press, 1986. pp. 148–49.&lt;/ref&gt; In cultures with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] spiritual influence, both good and evil are perceived as part of an antagonistic duality that itself must be overcome through achieving ''[[Nirvana]]''.&lt;ref name="Paul O. Ingram 1986. P. 148-149" /&gt; The [[ethics|philosophical]] questions regarding good and evil are subsumed into three major areas of study&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt;: [[Meta-ethics]] concerning the nature of good and evil, [[Normative ethics]] concerning how we ought to behave, and [[Applied ethics]] concerning particular moral issues. While the term is applied to events and conditions without agency, the forms of evil addressed in this article presume an evildoer or doers.

Some religions and philosophies deny evil's existence and usefulness in describing people.

==Etymology==
The [[modern English]] word ''evil'' ([[Old English]] {{lang|ang|yfel}}) and its [[cognate]]s such as the [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Übel}} and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{lang|nl|euvel}} are widely considered to come from a [[Proto-Germanic]] reconstructed form of ''*ubilaz'', comparable to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''huwapp-'' ultimately from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] form {{PIE|''*wap-''}} and suffixed zero-grade form {{PIE|''*up-elo-''}}. Other later Germanic forms include [[Middle English]] {{lang|enm|evel}}, {{lang|enm|ifel}}, {{lang|enm|ufel}}, [[Old Frisian]] {{lang|ofs|evel}} (adjective and noun), [[Old Saxon]] {{lang|osx|ubil}}, [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|ubil}}, and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] {{lang|got-Latn|ubils}}.

The root meaning of the word is of obscure origin though shown&lt;ref&gt;See 'Evil' entry in [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; to be akin to modern [[German language|German]] ''[[:de:Das Übel|Das Übel]]'' (although ''evil'' is normally translated as ''Das Böse'') with the basic idea of [[transgression (disambiguation)|transgressing]].&lt;ref name="Harper2001"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Harper, Douglas |year=2001 |title=Etymology for evil |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=evil|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese moral philosophy==
:''Main: [[Confucius#Ethics|Confucian Ethics]], [[Confucianism]] and ''[[Taoism#Ethics|Taoist Ethics]]''
As with Buddhism, in [[Confucianism]] or [[Taoism]] there is no direct analogue to the way ''good and evil'' are opposed although reference to ''demonic influence'' is common in [[Chinese folk religion]]. Confucianism's primary concern is with correct social relationships and the behavior appropriate to the learned or superior man. Thus ''evil'' would correspond to wrong behavior. Still less does it map into Taoism, in spite of the centrality of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] in that system, but the opposite of the cardinal virtues of Taoism, compassion, moderation, and humility can be inferred to be the analogue of evil in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/good&amp;evil.htm ''Good and Evil in Chinese Philosophy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529010501/http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/good%26evil.htm |date=2006-05-29 }} C.W. Chan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''History of Chinese Philosophy'' Feng Youlan, Volume II The Period of Classical Learning (from the Second Century B.C. to the Twentieth Century A.D). Trans. Derk Bodde. Ch. XIV Liu Chiu-Yuan, Wang Shou-Jen, and Ming Idealism. part 6 § 6 ''Origin of Evil''. Uses strikingly similar language to that in the etymology section of this article, in the context of Chinese Idealism.&lt;/ref&gt;

==European philosophy==
===Spinoza===
[[Baruch Spinoza|Benedict de Spinoza]] states
{{quote|1. By good, I understand that which we certainly know is useful to us. &lt;br /&gt; 2. By evil, on the contrary, I understand that which we certainly know hinders us from possessing anything that is good.&lt;ref name="ebgb"&gt;Benedict de Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Part IV ''Of Human Bondage or of the Strength of the Affects'' Definitions translated by W. H. White, Revised by A. H. Stirling, Great Books vol 31, Encyclopædia Britannica 1952 p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Spinoza assumes a [[formal system|quasi-mathematical]] style and states these further propositions which he purports to prove or demonstrate from the above definitions in part IV of his ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' :&lt;ref name="ebgb"/&gt;
* Proposition 8 "''Knowledge of good or evil is nothing but affect of joy or sorrow in so far as we are conscious of it.''"
* Proposition 30 "''Nothing can be evil through that which it possesses in common with our nature, but in so far as a thing is evil to us it is contrary to us.''"
* Proposition 64 "''The knowledge of evil is inadequate knowledge.''"
** Corollary "''Hence it follows that if the human mind had none but adequate ideas, it would form no notion of evil.''"
* Proposition 65 "''According to the guidance of reason, of two things which are good, we shall follow the greater good, and of two evils, follow the less.''"
* Proposition 68 "''If men were born free, they would form no conception of good and evil so long as they were free.''"

===Nietzsche===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in a rejection of the Judeo-Christian morality, addresses this in two works ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' and ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'' where he essentially says that the natural, functional non-good has been socially transformed into the religious concept of evil by the slave mentality of the weak and oppressed masses who resent their masters (the strong).

== Psychology ==
===Carl Jung===
[[Carl Jung]], in his book ''[[Answer to Job]]'' and elsewhere, depicted evil as the ''dark side of God''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgjungpage.org/learn/articles/book-reviews/727-answer-to-job-revisited-jung-on-the-problem-of-evil&lt;/ref&gt; People tend to believe evil is something external to them, because they project their [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] onto others. Jung interpreted the story of [[Jesus]] as an account of God facing his own shadow.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/dow/ Dreams of Wholeness]: A course of introductory lectures on religion, psychology and personal growth (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 1997/2008), see especially Chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the book may have had a sudden birth, its gestation period in Jung's unconscious was long. The subject of God, and what Jung saw as the dark side of God, was a lifelong preoccupation. An emotional and theoretical struggle with the core nature of deity is evident in Jung's earliest fantasies and dreams, as well as in his complex relationships with his father (a traditional minister), his mother (who had a strong spiritual-mystical dimension), and the Christian church itself. Jung's account of his childhood in his quasi-autobiography, Memories, Dreams, Reflections (New York: Vintage, 1963; henceforth MDR), provides deep, personal background about his early religious roots and conflicts.

=== Philip Zimbardo ===
In 2007, [[Philip Zimbardo]] suggested that people may act in evil ways as a result of a [[collective identity]]. This hypothesis, based on his previous experience from the [[Stanford prison experiment]], was published in the book ''The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lucifereffect.com/ Book website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==

===Problem of evil and source===

Most monotheistic religions posit that the singular God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and completely good.  The [[problem of evil]] asks how the apparent contradiction of these properties and the observed existence of evil in the world might be resolved.  Scholars have examined the question of suffering caused by and in both humans and animals, suffering caused by nature (like storms and disease). These religions tend to attribute the '''source of evil''' to something other than God, such as demonic beings or human disobedience.

Polytheistic and non-theistic religions do not have such an apparent contradiction, but many seek to explain or identify the source of evil or suffering. These include concepts of evil as a necessary balancing or enabling force, a consequence of past deeds ([[karma]]), or as an illusion, possibly produced by ignorance or failure to achieve enlightenment.

Non-religious atheism generally accepts evil acts as a feature of human actions arising from intelligent brains shaped by [[evolution]], and suffering from nature as a result of complex natural systems simply [[Naturalism (philosophy)|following physical laws]].

===Bahá'í Faith===
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] asserts that evil is non-existent and that it is a concept reflecting lack of good, just as cold is the state of no heat, darkness is the state of no light, forgetfulness the lacking of memory, ignorance the lacking of knowledge. All of these are states of lacking and have no real existence.&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coll |first='Abdu'l-Bahá |title=Some answered questions|year=1982|publisher=Bahá'í Publ. Trust|location=Wilmette, Illinois |isbn=978-0-87743-162-6 |edition=Repr. |translator=Barney, Laura Clifford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, evil does not exist and is relative to man. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], son of the founder of the religion, in [[Some Answered Questions]] states:

"Nevertheless a doubt occurs to the mind—that is, scorpions and serpents are poisonous. Are they good or evil, for they are existing beings? Yes, a scorpion is evil in relation to man; a serpent is evil in relation to man; but in relation to themselves they are not evil, for their poison is their weapon, and by their sting they defend themselves."&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"/&gt;

Thus, evil is more of an intellectual concept than a true reality. Since God is good, and upon creating creation he confirmed it by saying it is Good (Genesis 1:31) evil cannot have a true reality.&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"/&gt;

===Ancient Egyptian Religion===
Evil in the religion of [[Ancient Egypt]] is known as [[Isfet (Egyptian mythology)|Isfet]], "disorder/violence". It is the opposite of [[Maat]], "order", and embodied by the serpent god [[Apep]], who routinely attempts to kill the [[sun god]] [[Ra]] and is stopped by nearly every other deity. Isfet is not a primordial force, but the consequence of free will and an individual's struggle against the non-existence embodied by Apep, as evidenced by the fact that it was born from Ra's umbilical cord instead of being recorded in the religion's creation myths.&lt;ref&gt;Kemboly, Mpay. 2010. The Question of Evil in Ancient Egypt. London: Golden House Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[File:Extermination of Evil Tenkeisei crop.jpg|thumb|230px|''[[Extermination of Evil]]'', The God of Heavenly Punishment, from the Chinese tradition of [[yin and yang]]. Late [[Heian period]] (12th-century Japan)]]
:''Main: [[Buddhism#Buddhist ethics|Buddhist Ethics]]''

The primal duality in Buddhism is between suffering and enlightenment, so the good vs. evil splitting has no direct analogue in it. One may infer from the general teachings of the Buddha that the [[Dukkha|catalogued causes]] of suffering are what correspond in this belief system to 'evil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HyPnrDiBM7cC&amp;pg=PA424 ''Philosophy of Religion''] Charles Taliaferro, Paul J. Griffiths, eds. Ch. 35, ''Buddhism and Evil'' Martin Southwold p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/LayOutreachAndMeaningOfEvilPerson-Unno.html ''Lay Outreach and the Meaning of 'Evil Person''' Taitetsu Unno] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018093156/http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/LayOutreachAndMeaningOfEvilPerson-Unno.html |date=2012-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practically this can refer to 1) the three selfish emotions—desire, hate and delusion; and 2) to their expression in physical and verbal actions. See ''ten unvirtuous actions in Buddhism''. Specifically, ''evil'' means whatever harms or obstructs the causes for happiness in this life, a better rebirth, liberation from samsara, and the true and complete enlightenment of a buddha (samyaksambodhi).

"What is evil? Killing is evil, lying is evil, slandering is evil, abuse is evil, gossip is evil: envy is evil, hatred is evil, to cling to false doctrine is evil; all these things are evil. And what is the root of evil? Desire is the root of evil, illusion is the root of evil." Gautama Siddhartha, the founder of Buddhism, 563–483 BC.

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism, the concept of [[Dharma]] or righteousness clearly divides the world into good and evil, and clearly explains that wars have to be waged sometimes to establish and protect Dharma, this war is called [[Dharmayuddha]]. This division of good and evil is of major importance in both the Hindu epics of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. The main emphasis in Hinduism is on bad action, rather than bad people. The Hindu holy text, the [[Bhagavad Gita]], speaks of the balance of good and evil. When this balance goes off, divine incarnations come to help to restore this balance.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Sikhism===
In adherence to the core principle of spiritual evolution, the Sikh idea of evil changes depending on one's position on the path to liberation. At the beginning stages of spiritual growth, good and evil may seem neatly separated. Once one's spirit evolves to the point where it sees most clearly, the idea of evil vanishes and the truth is revealed. In his writings [[Guru Arjan]] explains that, because God is the source of all things, what we believe to be evil must too come from God. And because God is ultimately a source of absolute good, nothing truly evil can originate from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Gopal|title=Sri guru-granth sahib [english version]|date=1967|publisher=Taplinger Publishing Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Sikhism, like many other religions, does incorporate a list of "vices" from which suffering, corruption, and abject negativity arise. These are known as the [[Five Thieves]], called such due to their propensity to cloud the mind and lead one astray from the prosecution of righteous action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Charan|title=Ethics and Business: Evidence from Sikh Religion|ssrn=2366249|website=Social Science Research Network|publisher=Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandhu|first1=Jaswinder|title=The Sikh Model of the Person, Suffering, and Healing: Implications for Counselors|journal=International Journal for the Advancement of Counselling|date=February 2004|volume=26|issue=1|pages=33–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Moh]], or Attachment
* [[Lobh]], or Greed
* [[Krodh|Karodh]], or Wrath
* [[Kaam]], or Lust
* [[Hankaar|Ahankar]], or Egotism
One who gives in to the temptations of the [[Five Thieves]] is known as "[[Manmukh]]", or someone who lives selfishly and without virtue. Inversely, the "[[Gurmukh]], who thrive in their reverence toward divine knowledge, rise above vice via the practice of the high virtues of Sikhism. These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Arjan|title=The universal ideal of sikhism|journal=Global Dialogue|date=January 2000|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Selfless Service|Sewa]], or selfless service to others.
* [[Simran|Nam Simran]], or meditation upon the divine name.

===Islam===
{{see also|Islamic views on sin}}
There is no concept of absolute evil in [[Islam]], as a fundamental universal principle that is independent from and equal with good in a dualistic sense.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān'' Brill 2001 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Quran mentions the [[biblical]] forbidden tree, it never refers to it as the '[[tree of knowledge of good and evil]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān'' Brill 2001 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; Within Islam, it is considered essential to believe that all comes from [[God in Islam|God]], whether it is perceived as good or bad by individuals; and things that are perceived as ''evil'' or ''bad'' are either natural events (natural disasters or illnesses) or caused by humanity's free will. Much more the behavior of beings with free will, then they disobey God's orders, harming others or putting themselves over God or others, is considered to be evil.&lt;ref&gt;B. Silverstein ''Islam and Modernity in Turkey'' Springer 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-230-11703-7}} p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Evil doesn't necessarily refer to evil as an ontological or moral category, but often to harm or as the intention and consequence of an action, but also to unlawfull actions.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān'' Brill 2001 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;
Unproductive actions or those who do not produce benefits are also thought of as evil.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān'' Brill 2001 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; 

A typical understanding of evil is reflected by [[Al-Ash`ari]] founder of [[Ashʿari|Asharism]]. Accordingly, qualifying something as evil depends on the circumstances of the observer. An event or an action itself is neutral, but it receives its qualification by God. Since God is omnipotent and nothing can exist outside of God's power, God's will determine, whether or not something is evil.&lt;ref&gt;P. Koslowski ''The Origin and the Overcoming of Evil and Suffering in the World Religions'' Springer Science &amp; Business Media 2013 {{ISBN|978-9-401-59789-0}} page 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{see also|Satan#Judaism|label 1=Satan in Judaism}}
In [[Judaism]], evil is not real, it is [[Per se (terminology)|per se]] not part of God's creation, but comes into existence through man's bad actions. Human beings are responsible for their choices, and so have the [[Free will in theology#Judaism|free will]] to choose good (life in [[Jewish eschatology#"The world to come"|olam haba]]) or bad (death in heaven). ([[Deuteronomy]] 28:20) Judaism stresses obedience to God's [[mitzvah|613 commandments]] of the [[Written Torah]] (see also [[Tanakh]]) and the [[Halakha|collective body of Jewish religious laws]] expounded in the [[Oral Torah]] and [[Shulchan Aruch]] (see also [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]]). In Judaism, there is no prejudice in one's becoming good or evil at the time of birth, since full responsibility comes with [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]], when Jewish boys become 13, and girls become 12 years old.

===Christianity===
{{see also|Devil#Christianity|label 1=Devil in Christianity}}
Evil according to a Christian worldview is any action, thought, or attitude that is contrary to the character or will of God. This is shown through the law given in both the Old and New Testament. There is no moral action given in the Bible that is contrary to God's character or God's will.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Therefore, evil in a Christian worldview is contrasted by and in conflict with God's character or God's will. This evil shows itself through deviation from the character or will of God.

[[File:Ary Scheffer - The Temptation of Christ (1854).jpg|thumb|left|The [[devil]], in opposition to the will of God, represents evil and tempts Christ, the personification of the character and will of God. [[Ary Scheffer]], 1854.]]

[[Christian theology]] draws its concept of evil from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s. The [[Christian Bible]] exercises "the dominant influence upon ideas about God and evil in the Western world."&lt;ref&gt;David Ray Griffin, ''God, Power, and Evil: a Process Theodicy'' (Westminster, 1976/2004), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Old Testament, evil is understood to be an opposition to God as well as something unsuitable or inferior such as the leader of the [[fallen angel]]s [[Satan#Christianity|Satan]] &lt;ref&gt;Hans Schwarz, ''Evil: A Historical and Theological Perspective'' (Lima, Ohio: Academic Renewal Press, 2001): 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''poneros'' is used to indicate unsuitability, while ''kakos'' is used to refer to opposition to God in the human realm.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, ''Evil'', 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, the Catholic Church extracts its understanding of evil from its canonical antiquity and the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[theologian]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], who in ''Summa Theologica'' defines evil as the absence or privation of good.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologica'', translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province (New York: Benziger Brothers, 1947) Volume 3, q. 72, a. 1, p. 902.&lt;/ref&gt; [[French-American]] theologian [[Henri Blocher]] describes evil, when viewed as a theological concept, as an "unjustifiable reality. In common parlance, evil is 'something' that occurs in the experience that ''ought not to be''."&lt;ref&gt;Henri Blocher, ''Evil and the Cross'' (Downers Grove: [[InterVarsity Press]], 1994): 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mormonism]], mortal life is viewed as a test of faith, where one's choices are central to the Plan of Salvation. See [[Agency (LDS Church)]]. Evil is that which keeps one from discovering the nature of God. It is believed that one must choose not to be evil to return to God.

[[Christian Science]] believes that evil arises from a misunderstanding of the goodness of nature, which is understood as being inherently perfect if viewed from the correct (spiritual) perspective. Misunderstanding God's reality leads to incorrect choices, which are termed evil. This has led to the rejection of any separate power being the source of evil, or of God as being the source of evil; instead, the appearance of evil is the result of a mistaken concept of good. Christian Scientists argue that even the most ''evil'' person does not pursue evil for its own sake, but from the mistaken viewpoint that he or she will achieve some kind of good thereby.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Zoroastrianism===
In the originally [[Iranian religions|Persian]] religion of [[Zoroastrianism]], the world is a battleground between the god [[Ahura Mazda]] (also called [[Ormazd]]) and the malignant spirit [[Angra Mainyu]] (also called [[Ahriman]]). The final resolution of the struggle between good and evil was supposed to occur on a [[Last Judgment|day of Judgement]], in which all beings that have lived will be led across a bridge of fire, and those who are evil will be cast down forever. In Afghan belief, [[angels]] and [[saints]] are beings sent to help us achieve the path towards goodness.

==Question of a universal definition==
A fundamental question is whether there is a universal, transcendent definition of evil, or whether evil is determined by one's social or cultural background. [[C. S. Lewis]], in ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'', maintained that there are certain acts that are universally considered evil, such as [[rape]] and [[murder]]. The numerous instances in which rape or murder is morally affected by social context call this into question.  Up until the mid-19th century, the United States—along with many other countries—practiced forms of [[slavery]]. As is often the case, those transgressing moral boundaries stood to profit from that exercise. Arguably, slavery has always been the same and objectively evil, but men with a motivation to transgress will justify that action.

Universalists consider evil independent of culture, and wholly related to acts or intents. Thus, while the ideological leaders of Nazism and the Hutu Interhamwe accepted (and considered it moral) to commit genocide, the belief in genocide as ''fundamentally'' or ''universally'' evil holds that those who instigated this genocide are actually evil. Hitler considered it a moral duty to destroy Jews because he saw them as the root of all of Germany's ills and the violence associated with communism.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007822&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osama bin Laden]] found it moral to kill all Christians and Jews because he saw Islam as under attack by Western and US influence, accusing the US and Israel of forming a Crusader-Zionist alliance to destroy Islam, and considering US troops in Saudi Arabia infidels in the land of Islam's two holiest sites. He therefore considered non-Muslims and Shiite Muslims evil people intent on destroying Islamic purity and therefore heretic.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/08/afghanistan.terrorism15&lt;/ref&gt;

Given his mixed record of efforts to give the Cuban people free-of-charge healthcare and education as well as opposing US hegemony in Latin America, while crushing all opposition and wrecking the Cuban economy, [[Fidel Castro]] saw himself as a Caribbean Robin Hood who considered the US and capitalism evil, while [[Cuban Americans]], Cuban dissidents, and other communism-bashing people saw Castro as the personification of evil in late 20th-century Cuban and Latin American history, viewing his Castroist ideology as just as evil as any other form of communism and bashing him for locking up dissidents and killing innocents by firing squads, while creating mayhem in the developing world by working to foment violent communist revolutions in the Americas and many African countries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/the-fidel-castro-myth-debunked-the-death-of-a-tyrant-not-a-hero/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/fidel-castro-dead-latest-cuba-hero-tyrant-aged-90-a7440686.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://calvinchimes.org/2016/12/02/yes-fidel-castro-was-an-evil-man/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical questions==
===Approaches===
{{main article| Ethics}}
Views on the nature of evil belong to the branch of philosophy known as [[ethics]] - which in modern philosophy is subsumed into three major areas of study:
&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Meta-ethics]], that seeks to understand the nature of ethical [[property (philosophy)|properties]], statements, attitudes, and judgments. 
# [[Normative ethics]], investigates the set of questions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking. 
# [[Applied ethics]], concerned with the analysis of particular moral issues in private and public life.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

===Usefulness as a term===
One school of thought that holds that no ''person'' is evil and that only ''acts'' may be properly considered evil. Psychologist and mediator [[Marshall Rosenberg]] claims that the root of violence is the very concept of ''evil'' or ''badness''. When we label someone as bad or evil, Rosenberg claims, it invokes the desire to punish or inflict pain. It also makes it easy for us to turn off our feelings towards the person we are harming. He cites the use of language in Nazi Germany as being a key to how the German people were able to do things to other human beings that they normally would not do. He links the concept of evil to our judicial system, which seeks to create justice via punishment—''punitive justice''—punishing acts that are seen as bad or wrong.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}He contrasts this approach with what he found in cultures{{which|date=August 2013}} where the idea of evil was non-existent. In such cultures{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} when someone harms another person, they are believed to be out of harmony with themselves and their community, are seen as sick or ill and measures are taken to restore them to a sense of harmonious relations with themselves and others.

Psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] agrees, in his school of psychology called [[Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy]], or REBT. He says the root of anger, and the desire to harm someone, is almost always related to variations of implicit or explicit philosophical beliefs about other human beings. He further claims that without holding variants of those covert or overt belief and assumptions, the tendency to resort to violence in most cases is less likely.

American psychiatrist [[M. Scott Peck]] on the other hand, describes evil as ''militant ignorance''.&lt;ref name="Liemult"&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1983, 1988). ''People of the Lie: The hope for healing human evil''. Century Hutchinson.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Judeo-Christian concept of ''[[sin]]'' is as a process that leads one to ''miss the mark'' and not achieve perfection. Peck argues that while most people are conscious of this at least on some level, those that are evil actively and militantly refuse this consciousness. Peck describes evil as a malignant type of self-righteousness which results in a projection of evil onto selected specific innocent victims (often children or other people in relatively powerless positions). Peck considers those he calls evil to be attempting to escape and hide from their own conscience (through self-deception) and views this as being quite distinct from the apparent absence of conscience evident in [[Psychopathy|sociopaths]].

[[File:Genghis Khan.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Genghis Khan]] is considered by many people to be 'evil'.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanholiday/2012/05/07/9-lessons-on-leadership-from-genghis-khan-yes-genghis-khan/ 9 Lessons on Power and Leadership from Genghis Khan]". ''Forbes.'' 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He is responsible for over 40 million deaths.]]
According to Peck, an evil person:&lt;ref name="Liemult"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1978, 1992), ''The Road Less Travelled''. Arrow.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Is consistently self-deceiving, with the intent of avoiding [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and maintaining a [[self-image]] of [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfection]]
* Deceives others as a consequence of their own self-deception
* [[Psychological projection|Psychologically projects]] his or her evils and sins onto very specific targets, [[scapegoating]] those targets while treating everyone else normally ("their insensitivity toward him was selective") &lt;ref&gt;Peck, 1983/1988, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;
* Commonly hates with the pretense of love, for the purposes of self-deception as much as the deception of others
* Abuses political or emotional power ("the imposition of one's will upon others by overt or covert coercion") &lt;ref&gt;Peck, 1978/1992, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maintains a high level of respectability and lies incessantly in order to do so
* Is consistent with his or her sins. Evil people are defined not so much by the magnitude of their sins, but by their consistency (of destructiveness)
* Is unable to think from the viewpoint of their victim
* Has a covert intolerance to [[criticism]] and other forms of [[narcissistic injury]]

He also considers certain institutions may be evil, as his discussion of the [[My Lai Massacre]] and its attempted coverup illustrate. By this definition, acts of [[terrorism|criminal]] and [[state terrorism]] would also be considered evil.

===Necessity===
{{Main|Necessary evil}}
[[File:Martin_Luther_by_Cranach-restoration.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther]] believed that occasional minor evil could have a positive effect]]
[[Martin Luther]] argued that there are cases where a little evil is a positive good. He wrote, "Seek out the society of your boon companions, drink, play, talk bawdy, and amuse yourself. One must sometimes commit a sin out of hate and contempt for [[the Devil]], so as not to give him the chance to make one scrupulous over mere nothings&amp;nbsp;... "&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, ''Werke'', XX, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

According to certain{{which|date=August 2013}} schools of political philosophy, leaders should be indifferent to good or evil, taking actions based only upon practicality; this approach to politics was put forth by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], a 16th-century [[Florence, Italy|Florentine]] writer who advised politicians "...&amp;nbsp;it is far safer to be feared than loved."&lt;ref name = "erragh"&gt;Niccolo Machiavelli, ''The Prince'', Dante University of America Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-937832-38-3}} {{ISBN|978-0-937832-38-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[international relations]] theories of [[Realism in international relations|realism]] and [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]], sometimes called ''[[realpolitik]]'' advise politicians to explicitly ban absolute moral and [[Ethics|ethical]] considerations from international politics, and to focus on self-interest, political survival, and power politics, which they hold to be more accurate in explaining a world they view as explicitly [[amorality|amoral]] and dangerous. Political realists usually justify their perspectives by laying claim to a ''higher moral duty'' specific to political leaders, under which the greatest evil is seen to be the failure of the state to protect itself and its citizens. Machiavelli wrote: "...&amp;nbsp;there will be traits considered good that, if followed, will lead to ruin, while other traits, considered vices which if practiced achieve security and well being for the Prince."&lt;ref name = "erragh"/&gt;

[[Anton LaVey]], founder of the [[Church of Satan]], was a materialist and claimed that evil is actually good. He was responding to the common practice of describing sexuality or disbelief as evil, and his claim was that when the word ''evil'' is used to describe the natural pleasures and instincts of men and women or the skepticism of an inquiring mind, the things called evil are really good.&lt;ref&gt;Anton LaVey, ''The Satanic Bible'', Avon, 1969, {{ISBN|0-380-01539-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Cameron Jackson''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO|FASSA|FAHA}} {{small|FBA}} (born 1943) is an Australian [[analytic philosopher]], currently Emeritus Professor and former Director of the Research School of Social Sciences at [[Australian National University]].  He was also a regular visiting professor of philosophy at [[Princeton University]] from 2007 through 2014.  His research focuses primarily on [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], and [[meta-ethics]].

==Biography==
Frank Cameron Jackson was born in 1943. His father, Allan Cameron Jackson, was also a philosopher and student of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Information about Jackson's father being a student of Wittgenstein's taken from "Alan Donagan: A Memoir" by Barbara Donagan, ''Ethics'' (104) 1993, p.150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson studied mathematics and philosophy at the [[University of Melbourne]], going into residence at [[Trinity College (University of Melbourne)|Trinity College]] in 1961. In his later years in College, he was Clarke Scholar, and a member of the 2nd XVIII football team.&lt;ref&gt;"Minor Scholars", ''[http://www.trinity.unimelb.edu.au/Media/docs/fleur-de-lys-1963-8ded19b5-a1a3-4457-bc8f-84a2905cdb29-0.pdf The Fleur-de-Lys]'', Nov. 1963, p. 43. See also pp. 21–22, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He then received his PhD in philosophy from [[La Trobe University]]. He taught at the [[University of Adelaide]] for a year in 1967.  In 1978, he became chair of the philosophy department at [[Monash University]]. In 1986, he joined [[Australian National University]] (ANU) as Professor of Philosophy and Head of the Philosophy Program, Research School of Social Sciences. At ANU, he served as Director of the Institute of Advanced Studies from 1998 to 2001 and Deputy Vice-Chancellor in 2001. He was appointed as Distinguished Professor at ANU in 2003.  He now has a half-time appointment at Princeton University as well as a half-time appointment at ANU.&lt;ref&gt;Biographical information from Jackson's academic profile at ANU: http://philrsss.anu.edu.au/profile/frank-jackson&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson was awarded the [[Order of Australia]] in 2006 for service to philosophy and social sciences as an academic, administrator, and researcher. Jackson delivered the [[John Locke lectures]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1995.  His father had delivered the 1957-8 lectures, making them the first father-son pair to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''Supervenience, Metaphysics, and Analysis'' ([[John Locke Lectures]]), Oxford University, 1994–95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Jackson's philosophical research is broad, but focuses primarily on the areas of [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], and [[meta-ethics]].

In philosophy of mind, Jackson is known, among other things, for the ''knowledge argument'' against [[physicalism]]—the view that the universe is entirely physical (i.e., the kinds of entities postulated in physics). Jackson motivates the knowledge [[argument]] by a [[thought experiment]] known as [[Mary's room]]. Jackson phrases the thought experiment as follows:

{{cquote|Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor. She specializes in the neurophysiology of vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or the sky, and use terms like 'red', 'blue', and so on. She discovers, for example, just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina, and exactly how this produces via the central nervous system the contraction of the vocal cords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence 'The sky is blue'. (…) What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a color television monitor? Will she learn anything or not? It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the world and our visual experience of it. But then is it inescapable that her previous knowledge was incomplete. But she had all the physical information. Ergo there is more to have than that, and Physicalism is false.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 1982, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Jackson speaks about this theory to [[Nigel Warburton]] on [[Philosophy Bites]], an online podcast service [http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/4/4/6/446346944c84176f/Frank_Jackson_on_What_Mary_Knew.mp3?c_id=3656392&amp;expiration=1461656819&amp;hwt=3fce692405d512d06ff827ae63fb37ec here].

(As a side note, this thought-experiment was dramatised in the three-part [[Channel 4]] documentary "Brainspotting."  It also forms the central motif of author [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]]'s novel ''Thinks...'' (2001). Jackson makes an appearance in Lodge's novel as, of course, himself.)

Jackson used the knowledge argument, as well as other arguments, to establish a sort of [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], according to which certain mental states, especially qualitative ones, are non-physical. The view that Jackson urged was a modest version of [[epiphenomenalism]]—the view that certain mental states are non-physical and, although caused to come into existence by physical events, do not then cause any changes in the physical world.

However, Jackson later rejected the knowledge argument&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.udel.edu/apa/publications/proceedings/v76n3/public/abstracts.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516091824/http://www.apa.udel.edu/apa/publications/proceedings/v76n3/public/abstracts.asp|archivedate=2008-05-16|deadurl=yes|title=Jackson's Retraction|author=Torin Alter |publisher=APA }}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as other arguments against [[physicalism]]:

{{cquote|Most contemporary philosophers given a choice between going with science and going with intuitions, go with science. Although I once dissented from the majority, I have capitulated and now see the interesting issue as being where the arguments from the intuitions against physicalism—the arguments that seem so compelling—go wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 2003, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jackson argues that the intuition-driven arguments against physicalism (such as [[Mary's room|the knowledge argument]] and the [[Philosophical zombie|zombie argument]]) are ultimately misleading.

Jackson is also known for his defence of the centrality of conceptual analysis to philosophy; his approach, set out in his Locke Lectures and published as his 1998 book, is often referred to as the [[Canberra Plan]] for doing philosophy.

==Honours==
Jackson was elected Fellow of the [[Australian Academy of the Humanities]] (FAHA) in 1981&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanities.org.au/fellows/fellows/?find_contact_id=3085|title=Frank Jackson|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Academy of the Humanities|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia]] (FASSA) in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.assa.edu.au/fellows/159/|title=Emeritus Professor Frank Jackson AO|last=|first=|date=|website=Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded the [[Centenary Medal]] in 2001&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1126743&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true It's an Honour: Centenary Medal].

Retrieved 22 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 he was appointed as Distinguished Professor at the Australian National University and Emeritus Professor in 2014. In November 2018 Jackson received the Peter Baume Award, which recognises substantial and significant achievement and merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/peter-baume-award-emeritus-professor-frank-jackson-ao|title=Peter Baume Award: Emeritus Professor Frank Jackson AO|date=2018-11-15|work=ANU|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6605">'''François Poullain de la Barre''' ({{IPA-fr|də la baʁ|lang}}; born in July 1647 in [[Paris]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], died May 4, 1723 in [[Geneva]], [[Republic and Canton of Geneva|Republic of Geneva]]) was a writer and a [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] philosopher.

==Life==
Initially studying [[theology]], Poullain de la Barre adopted the philosophy of [[René Descartes|Descartes]]. He became a [[catholic Priest|priest]] in the [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] area before converting to [[Protestantism]]. After the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] revoked the [[Edict of Nantes]], he was exiled in the [[Republic of Geneva#Republic of Geneva (1541-1798 and 1813-1815)|Republic of Geneva]], where he obtained the citizenship (bourgeoisie) in 1716.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F15874.php Poullain de la Barre, François], in the [[Historical Dictionary of Switzerland]].&lt;/ref&gt;

He applied Cartesian principles to the question of women and wrote many texts of [[social philosophy]] which denounced injustice against [[woman]] and by the inequality of the female condition. Opposing the [[discrimination]] they experienced and as one of the champions of [[social equality]] between women and men, he is a precursor of the [[Feminism|feminists]].

In 1673, he published "On the equality of the two sexes: a physical and moral discourse in which is seen the importance of undoing prejudice in oneself," the first of three feminist works. He argues that the inequality in the treatment that women experience does not have a natural basis, but proceeds from cultural prejudice. He recommends that women receive a true education and also says all careers should be open to them, including scientific careers.

In a second work, "On the education of women, to guide the mind in sciences and manners", Barre continues reflection on the education of women.  Although the title of his third work may seem to suggest an opposing point of view, "Of the excellence of the men against the equality of the sexes," it is a reply to some of the standard arguments against gender equality, not a reversal of his own positions. [[Pierre Bayle]] has advanced the theory that Poullain may have refuted his own thesis because he felt threatened, but the arguments [[antifeminist]]s advanced are doubtful of this refutation. Opinions about Poullain de la Barre's place in the history of feminism vary considerably from one author to another.

[[Simone de Beauvoir]] includes a quotation from Poullain de la Barre in an epigraph to ''[[The Second Sex]] '' in 1949: "All that has been written about women by men should be
suspect, for the men are at once judge and party."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3707">'''Friedrich Waismann''' ({{IPA-de|ˈvaɪsman|lang}}; 21 March 1896 – 4 November 1959) was an [[Austria]]n [[mathematician]], [[physicist]], and philosopher.  He is best known for being a member of the [[Vienna Circle]] and one of the key theorists in [[logical positivism]].

==Biography==

Born to a Jewish family in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]], Waismann was educated in mathematics and physics at the [[University of Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=McGuiness|editor1-first=Brian|title=Friedrich Waismann: Philosophical Papers|url=https://books.google.co.il/books/about/Philosophical_Papers.html?id=EOXY6J7ZCpUC|location= |publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company|page=ix|date=1977|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, he began to study philosophy under the tutelage of [[Moritz Schlick]], the founder of the Vienna Circle. He emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1938.

He was a reader in [[philosophy of science]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 1937 to 1939, and lecturer in [[philosophy of mathematics]] at the [[University of Oxford]] from 1939 until his death. He died in [[Oxford]].

==Relationship with Wittgenstein==
Intermittently, from 1927 until 1936, Waismann had extensive conversations with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] about topics in philosophy of mathematics and [[philosophy of language]]. These conversations, recorded by Waismann, were published in ''Ludwig Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle'' (1979, ed. B.F. McGuinness). Other members of the Circle (including Schlick, [[Rudolf Carnap]], and [[Herbert Feigl]]) also spoke with Wittgenstein, but not to Waismann's extent.

At one point in 1934, Wittgenstein and Waismann considered collaborating on a book, but these plans fell through after their philosophical differences became apparent.

Waismann later accused Wittgenstein of [[obscurantism]] because of what he considered to be his betrayal of the project of logical positivism and empirically-based explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Shanker, S., &amp; Shanker, V. A. (1986), ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: critical assessments''. London: Croom Helm,50-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately the texts for the project, written or just transcribed by Waismann, have been published by [[Gordon Baker]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;''The Voices of Wittgenstein, the Vienna Circle'', by Ludwig Wittgenstein and Friedrich Waismann, Transcribed, edited and with an introduction by Gordon Baker, London:Routledge, 2003. On page xvii the editor asserts that "''Like Ludwig Wittgenstein und der Wiener Kreis'', this book is the publication of an important part of Waismann’s [[Nachlass]], and authorship is therefore appropriately ascribed to Waismann."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic philosophy and logical positivism==
In ''Introduction to Mathematical Thinking: The Formation of Concepts in Modern Mathematics'' (1936), Waismann argued that mathematical truths are true by convention rather than being necessarily (or verifiably) true. His collected lectures, ''The Principles of Linguistic Philosophy'' (1965), and ''How I See Philosophy'' (1968, ed. [[R. Harré]]), a collection of papers, were published posthumously.

==Porosity and verifiability==
Waismann's concept of open texture, or porosity, has been found in legal philosophy through the writings of [[H. L. A. Hart]] (see Hart's "The Concept of Law about Rule Skepticism" and Waismann's article "Verifiability").

She wrote on the [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of action]], [[philosophical logic]], [[philosophy of language]], and [[ethics]]. She was a prominent figure of [[analytical Thomism]].

Anscombe was a student of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and became an authority on his work and edited and translated many books drawn from his writings, above all his ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]''. Anscombe's 1958 article "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" introduced the term ''[[consequentialism]]'' into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary [[virtue ethics]]. Her monograph ''[[Intention (book)|Intention]]'' is generally recognised as her greatest and most influential work, and the continuing philosophical interest in the concepts of [[Intention (philosophy)|intention]], [[Action (philosophy)|action]], and [[practical reasoning]] can be said to have taken its main impetus from this work.

==Life==
G.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;M. Anscombe was born to Gertrude Elizabeth Anscombe and Allen Wells Anscombe, on 18 March 1919, in North Strand, [[Limerick]], Ireland, where her British father had been posted as an officer in the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. Both her mother and father were involved with education. Her mother was a headmistress and her father went on to head a department at [[Dulwich College]].{{sfn|Teichman|2017}}

She graduated from [[Sydenham High School]] in 1937 and went on to read "Mods &amp; Greats" (classics, ancient history, and philosophy) at [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]], graduating with a second class in Honour Moderations in 1939 and a first class in her degree Finals in 1941.{{sfn|Teichman|2017}} While still at Sydenham High School, she was converted to the Roman Catholic religion, and during her first undergraduate year she was received into the church. She remained a lifelong devout Catholic.{{sfn|Teichman|2017}} She garnered controversy when she publicly opposed Britain's entry into the Second World War, although her father had been a soldier and one of her brothers was to serve during the war.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1941 she married [[Peter Geach]], like her a Roman Catholic convert. He became, like her, a student of Wittgenstein and a distinguished British academic philosopher. Together they had three sons and four daughters.{{sfn|Teichman|2017}}

After graduating from Oxford, Anscombe was awarded a research fellowship for postgraduate study at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]], from 1942 to 1945.{{sfn|Teichman|2017}} Her purpose was to attend [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s lectures. Her interest in Wittgenstein's philosophy arose from reading the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' as an undergraduate. She claimed to have conceived the idea of studying with Wittgenstein as soon as she opened the book in [[Blackwell's]] and read section 5.53, "Identity of object I express by identity of sign, and not by using a sign for identity. Difference of objects I express by difference of signs." She became an enthusiastic student, feeling that Wittgenstein's therapeutic method helped to free her from philosophical difficulties in ways that her training in traditional systematic philosophy could not. As she wrote

{{quote|For years, I would spend time, in cafés, for example, staring at objects saying to myself: 'I see a packet. But what do I really see? How can I say that I see here anything more than a yellow expanse?'&lt;!-- Single quotation marks are used here, whereas they are not later on in the quotation. --&gt; ... I always hated [[phenomenalism]] and felt trapped by it. I couldn't see my way out of it but I didn't believe it. It was no good pointing to difficulties about it, things which [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] found wrong with it, for example. The strength, the central nerve of it remained alive and raged achingly. It was only in Wittgenstein's classes in 1944 that I saw the nerve being extracted, the central thought "I have got this, and I define 'yellow' (say) as this" being effectively attacked.{{sfn|Anscombe|1981|p=viii}}}}

After her fellowship at Cambridge ended, she was awarded a research fellowship at [[Somerville College, Oxford]],{{sfn|Teichman|2017}} but during the academic year of 1946/47, she continued to travel to Cambridge once a week to attend tutorials with Wittgenstein on the [[philosophy of religion]]. She became one of Wittgenstein's favourite students and one of his closest friends.{{sfn|Monk|1990|pp=497–498}} Wittgenstein affectionately referred to her by the pet name "old man" – an exception to his general dislike of academic women. His confidence in Anscombe's understanding of his perspective is shown by his choice of her as translator of his ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' before she had learned German, for which purpose he arranged a stay in Vienna.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Anscombe visited Wittgenstein many times after he left Cambridge in 1947, and travelled to Cambridge in April 1951 to visit him on his death bed. Wittgenstein named her, along with [[Rush Rhees]] and [[Georg Henrik von Wright]], as his [[literary executor]], and after his death in 1951 she was responsible for editing, translating, and publishing many of Wittgenstein's manuscripts and notebooks.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

She scandalised liberal colleagues with articles defending the Roman Catholic Church's opposition to [[contraception]] in the 1960s and early 1970s. Later in life, she was arrested twice while protesting outside an abortion clinic in Britain, after abortion had been legalised (albeit with restrictions).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Anscombe remained at Somerville College from 1946 to 1970. She was also known for her willingness to face fierce public controversy in the name of her Catholic faith. In 1956, while a research fellow at the [[University of Oxford]], she protested Oxford's decision to grant an honorary degree to [[Harry S. Truman]], whom she denounced as a mass murderer for his use of [[atomic bombs]] at [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. She and three others voted against awarding the honour to Truman. She would later defend her decision in a 1957 &lt;!-- or 1956?? --&gt; pamphlet.{{sfn|Teichman|2017}}{{verification needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Anscombe |first=G.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;M. |year=2008 |orig-year=1956 |title=Mr. Truman's Degree |url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/anscombetrumansdegree.htm |website=AnthonyFlood.com |access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anscombe was elected Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge in 1970, where she served until her retirement in 1986. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her later years, Anscombe suffered from heart disease, and was nearly killed in a car crash in 1996. She never fully recovered and she spent her last years in the care of her family in Cambridge.{{sfn|Teichman|2017}} She died on 5 January 2001, aged 81, with her husband and four of their seven children at her bedside.

She had not said where she was to be buried and the family chose what is now the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Ascension Parish]] burial ground, as it was the nearest one to their home. There was some difficulty in getting a full-size plot, where she could be buried without being cremated first. This was not possible in the new part of the cemetery, so the site finally obtained – after negotiation with Ely diocesan authorities – was that of an old grave, corner-to-corner with the plot where Wittgenstein had been buried half a century before.{{sfn|Teichmann|2008}}

===Debate with C.&amp;nbsp;S. Lewis===
As a young philosophy don, Anscombe acquired a reputation as a formidable debater. In 1948, she presented a paper at a meeting of Oxford's [[Socratic Club]] in which she disputed [[C. S. Lewis|C.&amp;nbsp;S. Lewis]]'s argument that [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] was self-refuting (found in the third chapter of the original publication of his book ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]''). Some associates of Lewis, primarily [[George Sayer]] and [[Derek Brewer]], have remarked that Lewis lost the subsequent debate on her paper and that this loss was so humiliating that he abandoned theological argument and turned entirely to devotional writing and children's literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=1999 |title=Frequently Asked Questions about C.S. Lewis |url=http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/lewis/cs-lewis.htm |publisher=Biblical Discernment Ministries |access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anscombe's impression of the effect upon Lewis is somewhat different:

{{quote|The fact that Lewis rewrote that chapter, and rewrote it so that it now has those qualities [to address Anscombe's objections], shows his honesty and seriousness. The meeting of the Socratic Club at which I read my paper has been described by several of his friends as a horrible and shocking experience which upset him very much. Neither Dr Havard (who had Lewis and me to dinner a few weeks later) nor Professor Jack Bennet remembered any such feelings on Lewis's part ... My own recollection is that it was an occasion of sober discussion of certain quite definite criticisms, which Lewis' rethinking and rewriting showed he thought was accurate. I am inclined to construe the odd accounts of the matter by some of his friends – who seem not to have been interested in the actual arguments or the subject-matter – as an interesting example of the phenomenon called "[[Psychological projection|projection]]".{{sfn|Anscombe|1981|p=x}}}}

As a result of the debate, Lewis substantially rewrote chapter 3 of ''Miracles'' for the 1960 paperback edition.{{sfn|Smilde|2011}}

==Work==

===On Wittgenstein===
Some of Anscombe's most frequently cited works are translations, editions, and expositions of the work of her teacher Ludwig Wittgenstein. She wrote an introduction (1959) to Wittgenstein's 1921 book, the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', which brought to the fore the importance of [[Gottlob Frege]] for Wittgenstein's thought and, partly on that basis, attacked [[Logical Positivism|"positivist"]] interpretations of the work. She co-edited his posthumous second book, ''[[Philosophical Investigations|Philosophische Untersuchungen/Philosophical Investigations]]'' (1953) with [[Rush Rhees]]. Her English translation of the book appeared simultaneously and remains standard. She also edited or co-edited several volumes of selections from his notebooks, translating some of them, for example the ''Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics'' (1956).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1978, Anscombe was awarded the [[Austrian Decoration for Science and Art|Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class]] for her work on Wittgenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/AB/AB_10542/imfname_251156.pdf |title=Reply to a Parliamentary Question |language=German |page=521 |trans-title=|format=pdf |location=Vienna |access-date=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Intention''===
Her most important work is the monograph ''[[Intention (book)|Intention]]'' (1957). Three volumes of collected papers were published in 1981: ''From Parmenides to Wittgenstein''; ''Metaphysics and the Philosophy of Mind''; and ''Ethics, Religion and Politics''. Another collection, ''Human Life, Action and Ethics'' appeared posthumously in 2005.

The aim of ''Intention'' (1957) was to make plain the character of human action and will. Anscombe approaches the matter through the concept of ''[[intention]]'', which, as she notes, has three modes of appearance in our language:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ''She is X'ing intentionally''
| intentional action
|-
| ''She is X'ing with the intention of doing'' Y &lt;br /&gt;or ... ''She is X'ing to Y''
| intention with which&lt;br /&gt; or further intention in acting
|-
|''She intends to Y'' &lt;br /&gt;or ... ''She has expressed the intention to do Y''
| expression of intention for the future;&lt;br /&gt; (what [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]] later called a pure intending)
|}

She suggests that a true account must somehow connect these three uses of the concept, though later students of intention have sometimes denied this, and disputed some of the things she presupposes under the first and third headings. It is clear though that it is the second that is crucial to her main purpose, which is to comprehend the way in which human thought and understanding and conceptualisation relate to the "events in a man's history", or the goings on to which he is subject.

Rather than attempt to define intentions in abstraction from [[action (philosophy)|actions]], thus taking the third heading first, Anscombe begins with the concept of an intentional action. This soon connected with the second heading. She says that what is up with a human being is an intentional action if the question "Why", taken in a certain sense (and evidently conceived as addressed to him), has application.{{sfn|Anscombe|1957|loc=sec. 5–8}} An agent can answer the "why" question by giving a reason or purpose for her action. "To do Y" or "because I want to do Y" would be typical answers to this sort of "why?"; though they are not the only ones, they are crucial to the constitution of the phenomenon as a typical phenomenon of human life.{{sfn|Anscombe|1957|loc=sec. 18–21}} The agent's answer helps supply the [[description]]s under which the action is intentional. Anscombe was the first to clearly spell out that actions are intentional under some descriptions and not others. In her famous example, a man's action (which we might observe as consisting in moving an arm up and down while holding a handle) may be intentional under the description "pumping water" but not under other descriptions such as "contracting these muscles", "tapping out this rhythm", and so on. This approach to action influenced Donald Davidson's theory, despite the fact that Davidson went on to argue for a causal theory of action that Anscombe never accepted&lt;ref&gt;See Anscombe 1981{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}} as well as {{harvnb|Anscombe|1957}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Intention'' (1957) is also the classic source for the idea that there is a difference in "[[direction of fit]]" between cognitive states like [[belief]]s and [[conation|conative]] states like [[Desire (philosophy)|desire]].{{efn|This theme is later taken up and discussed by {{harvnb|Searle|1983}}.}} Cognitive states describe the world and are causally derived from the facts or objects they depict. Conative states do not describe the world, but aim to bring something about in the world. Anscombe used the example of a shopping list to illustrate the difference.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Anscombe|1957|loc=sec. 32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The list can be a straightforward observational report of what is actually bought (thereby acting like a cognitive state), or it can function as a conative state such as a command or desire, dictating what the agent should buy. If the agent fails to buy what is listed, we do not say that the list is untrue or incorrect; we say that the mistake is in the action, not the desire. According to Anscombe, this difference in direction of fit is a major difference between speculative knowledge (theoretical, empirical knowledge) and practical knowledge (knowledge of actions and morals). Whereas "speculative knowledge" is "derived from the objects known", practical knowledge is – in a phrase Anscombe lifts from Aquinas – "the cause of what it understands".&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Anscombe|1957|loc=sec. 48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
Anscombe made great contributions to ethics as well as metaphysics. She is credited with having coined the term "[[consequentialism]]". In her 1958 essay "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]", Anscombe wrote:

{{quote|The denial of any distinction between foreseen and intended consequences, as far as responsibility is concerned, was not made by [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwick]] in developing any one 'method of ethics'; he made this important move on behalf of everybody and just on its own account; and I think it plausible to suggest that ''this'' move on the part of Sidgwick explains the difference between old-fashioned [[Utilitarianism]] and the ''consequentialism'', as I name it, which marks him and every English academic moral philosopher since him.}}

"Modern Moral Philosophy" is credited with reviving interest in and study of [[virtue ethics]] in Western academic philosophy.{{sfnm |1a1=Crisp |1a2=Slote |1y=1997 |1p=3 |2a1=Haldane |2y=2000}}

===Brute and institutional facts===
Anscombe also introduced the idea of a set of facts being 'brute relative to' some fact. When a set of facts xyz stands in this relation to a fact A, they are a subset out of a range some subset among which holds if A holds. Thus if A is the fact that I have paid for something, the brute facts might be that I have handed him a cheque for a sum which he has named as the price for the goods, saying that this is the payment, or that I gave him some cash at the time that he gave me the goods. There tends, according to Anscombe, to be an institutional context which gives its point to the description 'A', but of which 'A' is not itself a description: that I have given someone a shilling is not a description of the institution of money or of the currency of the country. According to her, no brute facts ''xyz'' can generally be said to entail the fact ''A'' relative to which they are 'brute' except with the proviso "under normal circumstances", for "one cannot mention all the things that were not the case, which would have made a difference if they had been."{{sfn|Anscombe|1958}} A set facts xyz ... may be brute relative to a fact A which itself is one of a set of facts ABC ... which is brute relative to some further fact W. Thus brute facts are not a distinct class of facts, to be distinguished from another class, 'institutional facts': the essential concept to grasp here is that of a set of facts being 'brute relative to' some fact. The term 'brute facts' had a major role to play in [[John Searle]]'s philosophy of [[speech act]]s and [[institution|institutional reality]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===First person===
Her paper "The First Person" follows up remarks by Wittgenstein, coming to the now-notorious conclusion that the first-person pronoun, "I", does not refer to anything (not, e.g., to the speaker). Few people accept the conclusion – though the position was later adopted in a more radical form by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] – but the paper was an important contribution to work on [[indexicals]] and self-consciousness that has been carried on by philosophers as varied as [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]], [[Peter Strawson]], [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]], [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]], [[John McDowell]], and Sebastian Rödl.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Views of her work==
The philosopher [[Candace Vogler]] says that Anscombe's "strength" is that "'when she is writing for [a] Catholic audience, she presumes they share certain fundamental beliefs,' but she is equally willing to write for people who do not share her assumptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Oppenheimer |first=Mark |date=8 January 2011 |title=Renaissance for Outspoken Catholic Philosopher |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/08/us/08beliefs.html |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A14 |access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] wrote that Anscombe was "perhaps the last great philosopher writing in English."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Scruton |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Scruton |year=2010 |title=Wine and Philosophy |url=http://www.decanter.com/features/wine-and-philosophy-246476/ |magazine=Decanter |volume=35 |pages=57–59 |access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Warnock]] described her in 2006 as "the undoubted giant among women philosophers" while [[John Haldane (philosopher)|John Haldane]] said she "certainly has a good claim to be the greatest woman philosopher of whom we know."{{sfn|Haldane|2000}}

glbinding is a generated, cross-platform C++ binding for OpenGL which is solely based on the new xml-based OpenGL API specification ({{URL|https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/ogl/trunk/doc/registry/public/api/gl.xml|gl.xml}}). It is a fully fledged OpenGL API binding, compatible with current code based on other C bindings, e.g., [[OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library|GLEW]]. The binding is generated using Python scripts and templates, that can be easily adapted to fit custom needs. It leverages modern C++11 features like enum classes, lambdas, and variadic templates, instead of relying on macros (all OpenGL symbols are real functions and variables). It provides type-safe parameters, per feature API header, lazy function resolution, multi-context and multi-thread support, global function callbacks, meta information about the generated OpenGL binding and the OpenGL runtime, as well as multiple examples for quick-starting your projects.

The complete glbinding source code including the generated files are published under the [[MIT License]].

'''Gordon Alexander Craig''' (November 13, 1913 &amp;ndash; October 30, 2005) was a [[Scottish-American]] historian of [[history of Germany|German history]] and of [[diplomatic history]].

==Early life==
Craig was born in [[Glasgow]]. In 1925 he emigrated with his family to [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, and then to [[Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]]. Initially interested in studying the law, he switched to [[history]] after hearing the historian Walter "Buzzer" Hall lecture at [[Princeton University]]. In 1935, Craig visited and lived for several months in [[Germany]], to research a thesis he was writing on the downfall of the [[Weimar Republic]]. This trip marked the beginning of lifelong interest with all things German. Craig did not enjoy the atmosphere of [[Nazi Germany]], and throughout his life, he sought to find the answer to the question of how a people who, in his opinion, had made a disproportionately large contribution to [[western culture|Western civilization]], allowed themselves to become entangled in what Craig saw as the corrupting embrace of [[National Socialism|Nazism]].

Of [[Adolf Hitler]], Craig once wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adolf Hitler was ''[[sui generis]]'', a force without a real historical past ... dedicated to the acquisition of power for his own gratification and to the destruction of a people whose existence was an offense to him and whose annihilation would be his crowning triumph. Both the grandiose barbarism of his political vision and the moral emptiness of his character make it impossible to compare him in any meaningful way with any other German leader. He stands alone.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Gordon ''Germany, 1866-1945'', Oxford: Claredon Press, 1978 page 543&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Education and career==
Craig graduated in history from [[Princeton University]], was a [[Rhodes Scholar]] at Balliol College, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], from 1936 to 1938, and served in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] as a captain and in the [[Office of Strategic Services]] during [[World War II]]. In 1941, he co-edited with [[Edward Mead Earle]] and [[Felix Gilbert]], on behalf of the American War Department, the book ''Makers of Modern Strategy: Military Thought From Machiavelli to Hitler'', which was intended to serve as a guide to strategic thinking for military leaders during the war.

After 1945, Craig worked as a consultant to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the State Department, the U.S. Air Force Academy and the Historical Division of the U.S. Marine Corps. He was a professor at Princeton University from 1950–61 and at [[Stanford University]] from 1961-79. In 1956-1957, he taught at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]]. In addition, he often held visiting professorships at the [[Free University of Berlin]]; in 1967, Craig was the only professor there to sign a petition asking for an investigation into charges of police brutality towards protesting students. Craig was chair of the history department at Stanford in 1972-1975 and 1978-1979. Between 1975-1985, he served as the vice-president of the [[Comité International des Sciences Historiques]]. In 1979, he became an [[emeritus professor]] and was awarded the title J. E. Wallace Sterling Professor of Humanities.

During his time at Stanford, Craig was considered to be a popular and innovative teacher who improved both undergraduate and graduate teaching, while remaining well liked by the students. After his retirement, he worked as a book reviewer for the ''[[New York Review of Books]]''. Some of his reviews attracted controversy, most notably in April 1996, when he praised [[Daniel Goldhagen]]'s book ''[[Hitler's Willing Executioners]]'' and later in September of the same year when he argued that [[David Irving]]'s work was valuable because of what Craig saw as Irving's [[devil's advocate]] role. Craig argued that Irving was usually wrong, but that by promoting what Craig saw as a twisted and wrongheaded view of history with a great deal of élan, Irving forced other historians to fruitfully examine their beliefs about what is known about the [[Third Reich]].

Craig was formerly President of the [[American Historical Association]]. In 1953, together with his friend [[Felix Gilbert]], he edited a [[prosopography]] of inter-war diplomats entitled ''The Diplomats'', an important source for diplomatic history in the [[interwar period]]. He followed this book with studies on the [[Prussian Army]], the [[Battle of Königgrätz]] and many aspects of European and German history. Craig was particularly noted for his contribution to the ''Oxford History of Modern Europe'' series entitled ''Germany, 1866-1945'' and its companion volume, ''The Germans''. The latter was a wide-ranging [[cultural history]] that explored aspects of being German, such as attitudes towards German-Jewish relations, money, students, women, and democracy, amongst others. The book was a best-seller in both the [[United States]] and [[Germany]] and Craig was awarded the [[Pour le Mérite]] medal for this book. Increasingly interested in cultural history in his later years, Craig subsequently wrote studies of several German writers, most notably [[Theodor Fontane]]. During this time, he also emerged as a celebrity in the [[German language|German-speaking]] world, frequently appearing as a guest on German [[television]] talk shows. By his later years, Craig was widely regarded as the doyen of American historians of Germany, and his opinions carried much weight.

Craig died in 2005, and was survived by his widow Phyllis, four children and eight grandchildren.

==Personal views==
Craig saw modern German history as a struggle between the positive, as exemplified by the values of humanist intellectuals, and negative forces in German life, as exemplified by Nazism. In a broader sense, he viewed this conflict as between enlightened spirit and authoritarian power. He was highly critical of those who saw [[Nazism]] as the culmination of German national character, while at the same time criticizing those who argued that Nazi Germany was just a ''Betriebsunfall'' (industrial accident) of history. Craig felt that the particular way [[Otto von Bismarck]] created the [[German Empire]] in 1871 was a tragedy, as it entrenched the forces of [[authoritarianism]] in German life. Similarly, Craig viewed the autonomous role of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] as a "State-within-the-State" as highly adverse to the development of [[democracy]].

Craig considered history not to be a [[social science]], but rather a "human discipline". He censured those historians who saw their work as social science and frequently called for historians to return to the methods of former times by seeking to "interconnect" [[history]] and [[literature]]. Craig was noted for his sparse, highly elegant literary style, together with a tendency to keep an ironic distance from his subjects. He was very fond of [[German literature]], and praised the novels of [[Theodor Fontane]] as the best portrayal of 19th century [[Germany]], which he considered superior to many works produced by historians. Craig's last project, incomplete at the time of his death, was a survey of novels set in [[Berlin]] &amp;ndash; Craig's favorite city &amp;ndash; in the 20th century.

The '''Han Kitab''' ({{zh||s=汉克塔布|t=漢克塔布|p=Hàn kètǎbù}}; {{lang-ar|هان کتاب|d=}}) was a collection of [[Islam in China|Chinese Islamic]] texts, written by [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]]s, which synthesized [[Islam]] and [[Confucianism]]. It was written in the early 18th century during the [[Qing dynasty]]. Its name is similarly synthesised: 'Han' is the Chinese word for Chinese, and 'kitab' means book in Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=ma+anliang&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nMIWTOy1JoT6lweJyPGHDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=han%20kitab&amp;f=false|title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=131|isbn=0-7007-1026-4|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liu Zhi (scholar)|Liu Zhi]] wrote his Han Kitab in [[Nanjing]] in the early 18th century.

The Han Kitab was widely read and approved of by later Chinese Muslims such as [[Ma Qixi]], [[Ma Fuxiang]], and [[Hu Songshan]]. They believed that Islam could be understood through Confucianism.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17613">'''Hans Blumenberg''' (born 13 July 1920 in [[Lübeck]]; died 28 March 1996 in [[Altenberge]]) was a German philosopher and intellectual historian.

He studied [[philosophy]], [[German studies]] and the classics (1939–47, interrupted by [[World War II]]) and is considered to be one of the most important German [[philosophers]] of the century. He died on 28 March 1996 in [[Altenberge]] (near [[Münster]]), Germany.

Blumenberg created what has come to be called 'metaphorology',  which states that what lies under metaphors and language modisms, is the nearest to the truth (and the farthest from ideologies).  His last works, especially "Care Crosses the River" (''Die Sorge geht über den Fluss''), are attempts to apprehend human reality through its metaphors and involuntary expressions. Digging under apparently meaningless anecdotes of the history of occidental thought and literature, Blumenberg drew a map of  the expressions, examples, gestures, that flourished in the discussions of what are thought to be more important matters.  Blumenberg's interpretations are extremely unpredictable and personal, all full of signs, indications and suggestions, sometimes ironic. Above all, it is a warning against the force of revealed truth, and for the beauty of a world in confusion.

== Life ==
Hans Blumenberg finished his university entrance exam in 1939 at the [[Katharineum|Katharineum zu Lübeck]], as the only student receiving the grade 'Auszeichnung' ('Distinguished'). But, being labelled a "Half-Jew", considering that his mother was [[Jewish]],&lt;ref&gt;Angus Nicholls, ''Myth and the Human Sciences: Hans Blumenberg's Theory of Myth'', Routledge (2014), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; the Catholic Blumenberg was barred from continuing his studies at any regular institution of learning in Germany.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Instead, between 1939 and 1941 he was to pursue his studies of philosophy at the theological Universities in [[University of Paderborn|Paderborn]] and [[University of Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], where he was forced to leave towards the end of this period. Back in Lübeck he was enrolled in the workforce at the [[Drägerwerk|Drägerwerk AG]]. In 1944 Blumenberg was detained in a concentration camp, but was released after the intercession of Heinrich Dräger. At the end of the war he was kept hidden by the family of his future wife Ursula. Blumenberg greatly despised the years which he claimed had been stolen from him by the Nazis. His friend Odo Marquard reports that after the war, Blumenberg slept only six times a week in order to make up for lost time.&lt;ref&gt;Brient, Elizabeth. (2001) ''The Immanence of the Infinite'', p. 6. The Catholic University of America Press, Washington, D.C. {{ISBN|0-8132-1089-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the theme of finite life and limited time as a hurdle for scholasticism recurs frequently in Part 2 of ''[[The Legitimacy of the Modern Age]]'' ({{lang-de|Die Legitimität der Neuzeit}}). After 1945 Blumenberg continued his studies of philosophy, Germanistics and classical philology at the [[University of Hamburg]], and graduated in 1947 with a dissertation on the origin of the ontology of the Middle Ages, at the [[University of Kiel]]. He received the postdoctoral habilitation in 1950, with a dissertation on 'Ontological Distance, an Inquiry into the Crisis of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] ('Die ontologische Distanz: Eine Untersuchung über die Krisis der Phänomenologie Husserls'). His mentor during these years was [[Ludwig Landgrebe]]. During Blumenberg's lifetime he was a member of the Senate of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]], a professor at several universities in Germany and a joint founder of the research group "Poetics and Hermeneutics".

== Work ==

Blumenberg's work was of a predominantly historical nature, characterized by his great philosophical and theological learning, and by the precision and pointedness of his writing style. The early text "Paradigms for a Metaphorology" explicates the idea of 'absolute metaphors', by way of examples from the [[history of ideas]] and philosophy. According to Blumenberg, metaphors of this kind, such as "the naked truth", are to be considered a fundamental aspect of philosophical discourse that cannot be replaced by concepts and reappropriated into the logicity of the 'actual'. The distinctness and meaning of these metaphors constitute the perception of reality as a whole, a necessary prerequisite for human orientation, thought and action. The founding idea of this first text was further developed in works on the metaphors of light in theories of knowledge, of being in navigation (''Shipwreck with Spectators'', 1979) and the metaphors of books and reading. (''The Legibility of the World'', 1979)

In Blumenberg's many inquiries into the history of philosophy the threshold of the late [[Middle Ages]] and the early [[Renaissance]] provides a focal point (''Legitimacy of the Modern Age'' and ''The Genesis of the Copernican World''). Inspired by (amongst others) [[Ernst Cassirer]]'s functional perspective on the history of ideas and philosophy, and the concomitant view of a rearrangement within the spiritual relationships specific to an epoch, Blumenberg rejects the substantialism of historical continuity — fundamental to the so-called 'theorem of secularization'; the Modern age in his view represents an independent epoch opposed to Antiquity and the Middle Ages by a rehabilitation of human curiosity in reaction to theological absolutism. "Hans Blumenberg targets [[Karl Löwith]]'s argument that progress is the secularization of Hebrew and Christian beliefs and argues to the contrary that the modern age, including its belief in progress, grew out of a new secular self-affirmation of culture against the Christian tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Cornelius A.|last= Buller|title=The Unity of Nature and History in Pannenberg's Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBwpiVj5skoC&amp;printsec=frontcover|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EBwpiVj5skoC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=%22Hans+Blumenberg+targets+Lowith+'s+argument+that+progress+is+the+secularization+of+Hebrew+and+Christian+beliefs+and+argues+to+the+contrary+that+the+modern+age,+including+its+belief+in+progress,+grew+out+of+a+new+secular+self-affirmation+of+culture+against+the+Christian+tradition%22 95]|year=1996|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|location=[[Lanham, Maryland]]|id={{ISBN|0-822-63055-9}}; {{ISBN|978-08-2263-055-5}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolfhart Pannenberg]], a student of Löwith, has continued the debate against Blumenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Wolfhart|last=Pannenberg|chapter=Christianity as the Legitimacy of the Modern Age (1968)|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=dS4mAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Pannenberg+%22Christianity+as+the+Legitimacy+of+the+Modern+Age%22+%22The+Idea+of+God+and+Human+Freedom%22|title=The Idea of God and Human Freedom, Volume 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dS4mAQAAMAAJ|pages=178–191|year=1973|publisher=Westminster Press|location=London|id={{ISBN|0-664-20971-8}}; {{ISBN|978-06-6420-971-1}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later works (''Work on Myth, Out of the Cave'') Blumenberg, guided by [[Arnold Gehlen]]'s  view of man as a frail and finite being in need of certain auxiliary ideas in order to face the "Absolutism of Reality" and its overwhelming power, increasingly underlined the anthropological background of his ideas: he treated myth and metaphor as a functional equivalent to the distancing, orientational and relieving value of institutions as understood by Gehlen. This context is of decisive importance for Blumenberg's idea of absolute metaphors. Whereas metaphors originally were a means of illustrating the reality of an issue, giving form to understanding, they were later to tend towards a separate existence, in the sciences as elsewhere. This phenomenon may range from the attempt to fully explicate the metaphor while losing sight of its illustrative function, to the experience of becoming immersed in metaphors influencing the seeming logicality of conclusions. The idea of 'absolute metaphors' turns out to be of decisive importance for the ideas of a culture, such as the metaphor of light as truth in Neo-Platonism, to be found in the hermeneutics of [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]. The critical history of concepts may thus serve the depotentiation of metaphorical power. Blumenberg did, however, also warn his readers not to confound the critical deconstruction of myth with the programmatical belief in the overcoming of any mythology. Reflecting his studies of Husserl, Blumenberg's work concludes that in the last resort our potential scientific enlightenment finds its own subjective and anthropological limit in the fact that we are constantly falling back upon the imagery of our contemplations.

{{Augustine}}
The '''''Harmony of the Gospels''''' ({{lang-la|De consensu evangeliorum}}) is a book by the 5th-century saint, [[Augustine of Hippo]].&lt;ref name=Lancel &gt;''Augustine through the ages: an encyclopedia'' by John C. Cavadini, 1999, {{ISBN|0-8028-3843-X}}, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book (which has four separate parts) Augustine assumes that [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] was the first Gospel, followed by Mark and Luke and that John was the last. He then analyzes and relates the specific passages between the Gospels, to build a [[Gospel harmony]].

In the book Augustine views the variations in the gospel accounts in terms of the different focuses of the authors on Jesus: Matthew on royalty, Mark on humanity, Luke on priesthood and John on divinity.&lt;ref name=Tuckett38 &gt;''Christology, Controversy and Community'' by David G. Horell and Christopher M. Tuckett, 2000, {{ISBN|9004116796}}, pp. 37–40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hsuan Hua Hong Kong 1.jpeg|thumb|right|Venerable Hsuan Hua meditating in the [[lotus position]]. [[Hong Kong]], 1953.]]
'''Hsuan Hua''' ({{zh|t= 宣化|p=Xuānhuà|l=proclaim and transform}}; April 16, 1918 &amp;ndash; June 7, 1995), also known as '''An Tzu''' and '''Tu Lun''', was a [[bhikkhu|monk]] of [[Chan Buddhism]] and a contributing figure in bringing [[Chinese Buddhism]] to the [[United States]] in the 20th century.

Hsuan Hua founded several institutions in the US. The [[Dharma Realm Buddhist Association]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drba.org/dharma/hsuanhuabio.asp DRBA Founder's Bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113192745/http://www.drba.org/dharma/hsuanhuabio.asp |date=2008-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (DRBA) is a Buddhist organization with chapters in North America, Australia and [[Asia]]. The [[City of Ten Thousand Buddhas]] (CTTB) in [[Ukiah, California]], is one of the first Chan Buddhist monasteries in America. Venerable Master Hsuan Hua founded [[Dharma Realm Buddhist University]] at CTTB. The Buddhist Text Translation Society works on the phonetics and translation of Buddhist scriptures from Chinese into English, Vietnamese, Spanish, and many other languages.

==Early life==
Hsuan Hua, a native of Shuangcheng County of [[Jilin]] (now [[Wuchang District]], [[Harbin]], [[Heilongjiang]]), was born '''Bai Yushu''' (白玉書) on  April 16, 1918. His parents were devout Buddhists. At an early age, Hua became a vegetarian like his mother, and decided to become a Buddhist monk.

At the age of 15, he took [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] in the [[Three Jewels]] under the Venerable Chang Zhi. That same year he began to attend school and studied texts of various [[Hundred Schools of Thought|Chinese schools of thought]], and the fields of medicine, divination, astrology, and physiology. At 19 years of age, Hua became a monastic, under the Dharma name An Tzu. (安慈)

==Vows==
He made the following eighteen vows to all sentient beings:

1. I vow that as long as there is a single Bodhisattva in the three periods of time throughout the ten directions of the Dharma Realm, to the very end of empty space, who has not accomplished Buddhahood, I too will not attain the right enlightenment.

2. I vow that as long as there is a single Pratyekabuddha in the three periods of time throughout the ten directions of the Dharma Realm, to the very end of empty space, who has not accomplished Buddhahood, I too will not attain the right enlightenment.

3. I vow that as long as there is a single Shravaka in the three periods of time throughout the ten directions of the Dharma Realm, to the very end of empty space, who has not accomplished Buddhahood, I too will not attain the right enlightenment.

4. I vow that as long as there is a single god in the Triple Realm who has not accomplished Buddhahood, I too will not attain the right enlightenment.

5. I vow that as long as there is a single human being in the worlds of the ten directions who has not accomplished Buddhahood, I too will not attain the right enlightenment.

6. I vow that as long as there is a single asura who has not accomplished Buddhahood, I too will not attain the right enlightenment.

7. I vow that as long as there is a single animal who has not accomplished Buddhahood, I too will not attain the right enlightenment.

8. I vow that as long as there is a single hungry ghost who has not accomplished Buddhahood, I too will not attain the right enlightenment.

9. I vow that as long as there is a single hell-dweller who has not accomplished Buddhahood, I too will not attain the right enlightenment.

10. I vow that as long as there is a single god, immortal, human, asura, air-bound or water-bound creature, animate or inanimate object, or a single dragon, beast, ghost, spirit, or the like of the spiritual realm that has taken refuge with me and has not accomplished Buddhahood, I too will not attain the right enlightenment.

11. I vow to fully dedicate all blessings and bliss which I myself ought to receive and enjoy to all living beings of the Dharma Realm.

12. I vow to fully take upon myself all sufferings and hardships of all living beings in the Dharma Realm.

13. I vow to manifest innumerable bodies as a means to gain access into the minds of living beings throughout the universe who do not believe in the Buddha-dharma, causing them to correct their faults and tend toward wholesomeness, repent of their errors and start anew, take refuge in the Triple Jewel, and ultimately accomplish Buddhahood.

14. I vow that all living beings who see my face or even hear my name will fix their thoughts on Bodhi and quickly accomplish the Buddha Way.

15. I vow to respectfully observe the Buddha's instructions and cultivate the practice of eating only one meal per day.

16. I vow to enlighten all sentient beings, universally responding to the multitude of differing potentials.

17. I vow to obtain the five eyes, six spiritual powers, and the freedom of being able to fly in this very life.

18. I vow that all of my vows will certainly be fulfilled.
 		
Also:
 	
I vow to save the innumerable living beings.
 	
I vow to eradicate the inexhaustible afflictions.

I vow to study the illimitable Dharma-doors.

I vow to accomplish the unsurpassed Buddha Way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cttbusa.org/founder/18vows.asp The Eighteen Great Vows of theVenerable Master Hsuan Hua]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bringing Chinese Buddhism to the United States==
In 1959, Hsuan Hua sought to bring Chinese Buddhism to the West.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Ronald (1995). "The Venerable Master Hsuan Hua Brings the Dharma to the West." In Memory of the Venerable Master Hsuan Hua, Volume One. Burlingame, CA:Buddhist Text Translation Society, pp. 59-68. Reprinted in The Flower Adornment Sutra, Chapter One, Part One “The Wondrous Adornment of the Rulers of the Worlds; A Commentary by Venerable Master Hsuan Hua. Burlingame, CA: Buddhist Text Translation Society, 2004, pp. 274-286.&lt;/ref&gt; He instructed his disciples in America to establish a Buddhist association, initially known as The Buddhist Lecture Hall, which was renamed the Sino-American Buddhist Association before taking its present name: the [[Dharma Realm Buddhist Association]].

Hsuan Hua traveled to [[Australia]] in 1961 and taught there for one year, returning to Hong Kong in 1962. That same year, at the invitation of American Buddhists, he traveled to the United States; his intent was to "come to America to create Patriarchs, to create Buddhas, to create Bodhisattvas".&lt;ref&gt;Prebish, Charles (1995). "Ethics and Integration in American Buddhism". ''Journal of Buddhist Ethics'', Vol. 2, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Francisco===
Hsuan Hua resided in [[San Francisco]], where he built a lecture hall. Hsuan Hua began to attract young Americans who were interested in [[meditation]]. He conducted daily meditation sessions and frequent Sutra lectures.

At that time, the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] occurred between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], and Hsuan Hua embarked on a fasting period for thirty-five days to pray for an end to the hostilities and for world peace. In 1967, Hsuan Hua moved the Buddhist Lecture Hall back to Chinatown, locating it in the [[Mazu (goddess)|Tianhou]] Temple.

===First American Sangha===
In 1968, Hsuan Hua held a [[Śūraṅgama Sūtra|Shurangama]] Study and Practice Summer Session. Over thirty students from the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]] came to study the Buddha’s teachings. After the session was concluded, five young Americans (Bhikṣu Heng Chyan, Heng Jing, and Heng Shou, and Bhikṣuṇīs Heng Yin and Heng Ch'ih) requested permission to take full ordination.

Venerable Hsuan Hua lectured on the entire ''{{IAST|Śūraṅgama Sūtra}}'' in 1968 while he was in the United States. These lectures were recorded in an eight-part series of books containing the sutra and a traditionally rigorous form of commentary that addresses each passage. It was again lectured by the original translator monks and nuns of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas at [[Dharma Realm Buddhist University]] in the summer of 2003.

==Vision of American Buddhism==
With the founding of his American Sangha, Hsuan Hua embarked on his personal vision for [[Buddhism in the United States]]:
* Bringing the true and proper teachings of the Buddha to the West and establishing a proper monastic community of the fully ordained Sangha here
* Organizing and supporting the translation of the entire Buddhist canon into English and other Western languages&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Ronald  (1969). “The Heart Sūtra and the Commentary of Tripiṭaka Master Hsüan Hua.” Master’ Thesis, University of Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Ronald (1975). “The Śūraṅgama-sūtra with Tripiṭaka Master Hsüan-hua’s Commentary An Elementary Explanation of Its General Meaning: A Preliminary Study and Partial Translation.” Ph.D. Dissertation. University of California at Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promoting wholesome education through the establishment of schools and universities

===Hosting ordination ceremonies===
Because of the increasing numbers of people who wished to become monks and nuns under Hsuan Hua's guidance, in 1972 he decided to hold ordination ceremonies at Gold Mountain [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|Dhyana]] Monastery. Two monks and one nun received ordination. Subsequent ordination platforms have been held at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas in 1976, 1979, 1982, 1989, 1991, and 1992, and progressively larger numbers of people have received full ordination. Over two hundred people from countries all over the world were ordained under him.

===Theravada and Mahayana traditions===
Having traveled to Thailand and Burma in his youth to investigate the Southern Tradition of Buddhism, Hsuan Hua wanted to bridge what he perceived as a rift between the Northern ([[Mahayana]]) and Southern ([[Theravada]]) traditions. In an address to [[Ajahn Sumedho]] and the monastic community at [[Amaravati Buddhist Monastery]] on October 6, 1990, Hsuan Hua stated:&lt;ref&gt;Hsuan Hua. ''The Shurangama Sutra with Commentary, Volume 7.'' 2003. p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In Buddhism, we should unite the Southern and Northern traditions. From now on, we won't refer to Mahayana or Theravada. Mahayana is the "Northern Tradition" and Theravada is the "Southern Tradition." [...] Both the Southern and the Northern Traditions' members are disciples of the Buddha, we are the Buddha's descendants. As such, we should do what Buddhists ought to do. [...] No matter the Southern or the Northern Tradition, both share the common purpose of helping living beings bring forth the Bodhi-mind, to put an end to birth and death, and to leave suffering and attain bliss.}}

On the occasion of the opening ceremony for the Dharma Realm Buddhist University, Hsuan Hua presented Venerable [[K. Sri Dhammananda]] of the Theravada tradition with an honorary [[Ph.D.]] He also donated a major piece of the land that would become [[Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery]], a Theravada Buddhist monastery in the Thai Forest tradition of [[Ajahn Chah]], located in [[Redwood Valley, California]].

Hsuan Hua would also invite [[Bhikkhu]]s from both traditions to jointly conduct the High Ordination.

===Chinese and American Buddhism===
From July 18 to the 24th of 1987, Hsuan Hua hosted the ''Water, Land, and Air Repentance Dharma Assembly'', a centuries-old ritual often seen as the "king of dharma services" in Chinese Buddhism, at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas and invited over seventy Buddhists from [[mainland China]] to attend. This was the first time the service was known to have been held in North America.

On November 6, 1990, Hsuan Hua sent his disciples to [[Beijing]] to bring the Dragon Treasury ({{zh|t= 龍藏|p=lóngzáng}}) edition of the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] back to CTTB, furthering his goal of bringing Buddhism to the US.

==Death==

On June 7, 1995, Hsuan Hua died in [[Los Angeles]] at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]]. His sudden passing came as a shock to most of his disciples.

===Funeral===
Hsuan Hua's funeral lasted from June 8 to July 29. On June 17, Hsuan Hua's body was taken from Southern to Northern California, returning to the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas.  All major services during the funeral were presided over by Venerable Ming Yang, abbot of Longhua Temple in Shanghai and a longtime friend of Hsuan Hua's.

On July 28, monks from both Theravada and Mahayana traditions hosted a memorial ceremony and cremation.  The two thousand and some followers from the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and various Asian and European countries, including many of Hsuan Hua’s American disciples, came to CTTB to take part in the funeral service. Letters of condolences from Buddhist monks and dignitaries, including from President [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]], were read during the memorial service.

A day after the cremation, July 29, Hsuan Hua's remains were scattered in the air above the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas by two disciples, [[Heng Sure]] and Heng Chau, one of Master Hua's first disciples, from a hot air balloon.

After the funeral, memorial services commemorating Hsuan Hua's life were held in various parts of the world, including [[Taiwan]], [[China]], and [[Canada]]. His [[śarīra]] (relics) were distributed to many of his temples, disciples and followers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20814">The '''Jerusalem School of Synoptic Research''' is a consortium of Jewish and Christian scholars that study the [[Synoptic Gospels]] in light of the historic, linguistic and cultural milieu of [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name="JSSR"&gt;[http://www.jerusalemschool.org/ Jerusalem School of Synoptic Research. Retrieved 05 Nov. 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  The beginnings of the collegial relationships that formed the Jerusalem School of Synoptic Research can be traced back to a [[Jewish]] [[scholar]] and a [[Christian]] [[scholar]], respectively [[David Flusser]] and [[Robert L. Lindsey]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Haydid"&gt;"A Tribute to Robert L. Lindsey, Ph. D. (1917-1995) and his work...:Excerpt from November 1996 Tree of Life Quarterly Membership Magazine", HaY'Did. Retrieved 05 Nov. 2006. [http://www.haydid.org/lindsey.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; For the past 50 years, ‘Christian scholars fluent in [[Hebrew]] and living in the land of Israel have collaborated with Jewish scholars to examine Jesus’ sayings from a Judaic and Hebraic perspective’.

==Viewpoints==
The consortium's own website states three assumptions, shared by its members, namely, "1) the importance of Hebrew language, 2) the relevance of Jewish culture", and 3) the significance of Semitisms underneath sections of the Synoptic Gospels that in turn often yield results to the interconnection (of dependence) between the Synoptic Gospels.&lt;ref name="JSSRPillars"&gt;"Methodology." Jerusalem School of Synoptic Research. Retrieved 26 Sep. 2009. [http://www.jerusalemschool.org/Methodology/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  (These three assumptions, and not one synoptic theory, are the shared presuppositions of Jerusalem School members.)

The first two assumptions are perhaps not shared by the majority of [[New Testament]] scholars, but are neither considered to be fringe positions. Today, the common view is that Jesus and His milieu spoke [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]], however that Hebrew was spoken and even important is not unique to the Jerusalem School of Synoptic Research.&lt;ref name="HebrewSpoken"&gt;As early as the beginning of the 20th century, we already have: Moses Hirsch Segal ''Mishnaic Hebrew and Its Relation to Biblical Hebrew and to Aramaic. A Grammatical Study ... Reprinted from the Jewish Quarterly Review for July'' Horace Hart: Oxford, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; Many more New Testament Scholars worldwide have increasingly affirmed the importance of Jewish culture for the understanding of Jesus. John P. Meier is exemplary of this significant trend when he poignantly criticizes scholarship in the twentieth century that has paid lip service to the 'Jewish Jesus' but has not really fleshed this out, stating that if we do not have a [[Halakha|halachic]] Jesus, we don't have an historical Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Meier "rejects a major academic failure of Jesus research: mouthing respect for Jesus' Jewishness while avoiding like the plague the beating heart of that Jewishness: the Torah in all its complexity. However bewildering the positions Jesus sometimes takes, he emerges from this volume as a Palestinian Jew engaged in the legal discussions and debates proper to his time and place. It is Torah and Torah alone that puts flesh and bones on the spectral figure of "Jesus the Jew." No halakic Jesus, no historical Jesus. This is the reason why many American books on the historical Jesus may be dismissed out of hand: their presentation of lst-century Judaism and especially of Jewish Law is either missing in action or so hopelessly skewed that it renders any portrait of Jesus the Jew distorted from the start. It is odd that it has taken American scholarship so long to absorb this basic insight: either one takes Jewish Law seriously and "gets it right" or one should abandon the quest for the historical Jesus entirely.....The patient reader of Volume Four of A Marginal Jew may at this juncture be sick unto death of the mantra, 'the historical Jesus is the halakic Jesus.' But at least such readers have been inoculated for life against the virus that induces legal amnesia in most Americans writing on Jesus. The halakic dimension of the historical Jesus is never exciting but always essential." John P. Meier, "Conclusion to Volume Four" in A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus, Volume IV: Law and Love, (The Anchor Yale Bible Reference Library: Yale University Press, 2009), 648 and 649.&lt;/ref&gt;  

&lt;br /&gt;
The third assumption of the Jerusalem School basically seems to be concerned with not holding to an assumed-default position of Markan priority.  It is especially the third assumption in more individually pronounced forms that has invited a response of the academic community.  Some scholars have perceived the Jerusalem School as a group that holds to [[:Jerusalem_school_hypothesis#Lukan_Priority_Theory|Lukan Priority]].&lt;ref name="Lukan Priority"&gt;Among others: Delbert Royce Burkett, ''Rethinking the Gospel sources: from proto-Mark to Mark'', T&amp;T Clark: NY, 4. Beate Ego,Armin Lange,Peter Pilhofer, ''Gemeinde ohne Tempel /Community without Temple'', Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zum Neuen Testament, Mohr Siebeck: Tubingen, 462n2&lt;/ref&gt;  But this perception is incomplete since it is only Robert Lindsey and David Bivin who have argued strongly for Lukan priority.  The third methodological assumption of the Jerusalem School is much broader and open, without any one theory being affirmed:

{{quote|text=Tracing the linguistic and cultural data within the Synoptic Gospels leads to insights into their literary relationships 
The Synoptic Gospels provide linguistic, literary, social, geographical and cultural clues to their internal structure and development. The evangelists composed their works in Greek, yet Semitic idioms are readily evident in all three. The gospels' Greek and Semitic linguistic elements and Jewish cultural items must be identified, carefully traced through the three gospels, and then incorporated into a theory of synoptic relationships."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jerusalemschool.org/Methodology/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  }}

Many scholars affirm Semitic quality of the Synoptic Gospel material as indicative of earlier material, but how to determine Semitic quality has been hotly debated.  Recently this subject of a Hebrew Gospel and Semitic material has been discussed by James R. Edwards (although with somewhat differing results than Jerusalem School members).&lt;ref&gt;James R. Edwards, The Hebrew Gospel and the Development of the Synoptic Tradition. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most extensive Jerusalem School publication on Semitic material and types of Semitic interference can be found in an extended essay and appendix (critical notes) in Jesus' Last Week (Leiden: Brill, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Randall Buth and Brian Kvasnica. "Temple Authorities and Tithe-Evasion: The Linguistic Background and Impact of the Parable of the Vineyard Tenants and the Son." Pages 53-80 (essay), 259-317 (Critical Notes) in Jesus' Last Week: Jerusalem Studies on the Synoptic Gospels, Volume 1. Edited by R. S. Notley, B. Becker, and M. Turnage. Jewish and Christian Perspectives 11. Leiden: Brill, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

(Jewish and Christian perspectives series, 26)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The articles in this collection demonstrate that a change is taking place in New Testament studies. Throughout the twentieth century, New Testament scholarship primarily worked under the assumption that only two languages, Aramaic and Greek, were in common use in the land of Israel in the first century. The current contributors investigate various areas where increasing linguistic data and changing perspectives have moved Hebrew out of a restricted, marginal status within first-century language use and the impact on New Testament studies. Five articles relate to the general sociolinguistic situation in the land of Israel during the first century, while three articles present literary studies that interact with the language background. The final three contributions demonstrate the impact this new understanding has on the reading of Gospel texts.

== Reactions and criticism ==
Both affirmation and strong criticism has come because of a lay-oriented &lt;ref name="Lay Audience"&gt;This book is evidently catered toward the lay audience, because of its style, incidental footnotes and type of publisher. It probably received nevertheless a review from Brown, because of its unique character and impact in its time of publication.&lt;/ref&gt; co-authored book ''Understanding the Difficult Words of Jesus''&lt;ref name="Understanding the Difficult Words of Jesus"&gt;David Bivin and Roy B. Blizzard Jr. ''Understanding the Difficult Words of Jesus'', Shippensburg, PA: Destiny Image Publishers, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[David Bivin]] and Roy B. Blizzard Jr. which was reviewed by [[Michael L. Brown]]. The book itself is not published by the Jerusalem School, and only one of the co-authors is of the Jerusalem School. Yet, Brown not only questioned the work of individual school member David Bivin and co-author Roy Blizzard Jr., but by association also the Jerusalem School of Synoptic Research as a whole.  Yet, even in his criticism of reconstructing a Hebrew Gospel (of which many Jerusalem School members are skeptical of as well), he affirms three significant points, which dovetail with the methodology—the three assumptions—of the Jerusalem School:
{{quote|text=In the event that JSSR devotes its primary efforts to: 1) the sober elucidation of texts which New Testament scholarship recognizes as difficult and obscure; 2) providing Jewish background to the Scriptures; 3) and shedding light on Semitic nuances of biblical words and phrases, then all of us can glean from their work. Should the Jerusalem School continue to devote itself primarily to the hypothetical work of retranslation and reconstruction, then their potential contribution to the ongoing ministry of the Word would be relegated to relative unimportance.&lt;ref name="Mishkan 4"&gt;Michael L. Brown "The Issue of the Inspired Text: A Rejoinder to David Bivin" in ''Mishkan'', Isso No. 20, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Since the Jerusalem School has not devoted itself primarily to the hypothetical work of REtranslation and reconstruction, the latter criticism is muted.  (The Jerusalem School has never attempted to translate the Greek texts into proto-Mishnaic Hebrew in order to thereby declare it to be the reconstructed original Hebrew Gospel.  See Lindsey's 'A Hebrew Translation of the Gospel of Mark for a translation of Mark' - which is a ''translation'' of Mark, not a reconstruction of a supposed original Gospel.)
A further academic description of the Jerusalem School and its methodology and dissemination in the lay and academic field is found in ''Hebräisches Evangelium und synoptische Überlieferung: Untersuchungen zum hebräischen Hintergrund der Evangelien''.&lt;ref name="Hebräisches Evangelium und synoptische Überlieferung"&gt;Baltes, Guido. Hebräisches Evangelium und synoptische Überlieferung: Untersuchungen zum hebräischen Hintergrund der Evangelien. Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2011, 65-67.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Jesus' Last Week'''''

The recent combined effort of Jerusalem School members in ''Jesus' Last Week: Jerusalem Studies in the Synoptic Gospels - Volume One'', a work clearly catered toward the academic community&lt;ref name="Academic Audience"&gt;This book is evidently catered toward the academic community, because of its style, abundance of footnotes and type of publisher. The review by Collins published in ''Nova Testamentum'' supports the academic nature.&lt;/ref&gt; has received positive reviews, for example by Nina L. Collins&lt;ref name="Nina Collins"&gt;Nina Collins is a British widely published scholar in the fields of Judaism and Christianity.&lt;/ref&gt; in the journal ''Novum Testamentum''. She closed her review by stating that:
{{quote|text=This book is a product of the Jerusalem School of Synoptic Research, details of which can be found at http://www.jerusalemschool.org/index.htm. There is little doubt that, like the bird cage in Alexandria, this devoted ''beit knesset'' of properly equipped scholars has produced a perceptive set of essays, and it will be interesting to see the further insights that future volumes in this series will almost certainly produce.&lt;ref name="NovT 49/4 (2007) 407-409"&gt;Collins, Nina L. "Review: R. Steven Notley, Marc Turnage, and Brian Becker, eds., Jesus' Last Week: Jerusalem Studies in the Synoptic Gospels - Volume One." ''NovT'' 49/4 (2007) 407-409.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Other reactions have also been positive, as exemplified by Robert L. Webb's review in the [http://www.brill.nl/jshj Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus]: 

{{quote|text=This fascinating collection of essays demonstrates the fruitfulness of ‘collaboration between Jewish and Christian members’ of the School as they continue to study the Synoptic Gospels together. &lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Webb, McMaster University, in Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus, Jan2007, Vol. 5 Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A mixed review found the overall discussion in the volume to be "stimulating, even provocative from the perspective of current critical Synoptic studies." However, the review contained also some concerns:

{{quote|text=While there may be something to Semitic influences, contributors routinely fail to draw the reader’s attention to the speculation necessarily involved with it as a working methodological assumption. Furthermore, the contributors do not seem to engage with much critical reflection on the scholarly discussion on Semitic influences, background, or interfaces with the Synoptic texts as we have them in Greek, even finding wordplays and strings of linguistic connections based on alleged Semitic originals, which we do not have. There seems to be a prevailing assumption that “taking seriously” the trilingual context of Jesus’ setting and that of the Synoptics itself mandates a Semitic Vorlage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/7424_8096.pdf Daniel M. Gurtner, "Review: R. Steven Notley, Marc Turnage, and Brian Becker, eds., Jesus' Last Week: Jerusalem Studies in the Synoptic Gospels - Volume One."

'''Joseph Stephen O’Leary''' is an Irish Roman Catholic theologian. Born in Cork, 1949, he studied literature and theology at [[Maynooth College]] (BA 1969; DD 1976). He also studied at the [[Gregorian University]], Rome (1972-3) and in Paris (1977–79). Ordained for the [[Diocese of Cork and Ross]] in 1973, he was a chaplain at [[University College Cork]] (1980–81). He taught theology at the [[University of Notre Dame]] (1981–82) and [[Duquesne University]] (1982–83) before moving to Japan in August, 1983. He worked as a researcher at the Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture, [[Nanzan University]], Nagoya (1985–86), where he later held the Roche Chair for Interreligious Research (2015–16).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/en/activities/the-roche-chair/ |title=The Roche Chair for Interreligious Research at the Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He taught in the Faculty of Letters at [[Sophia University]], Tokyo, from 1988 to 2015.

Other assignments include teaching philosophy and theology in the Philippines in 1986–87, the Lady Donnellan Lecturership at [[Trinity College Dublin]], in the spring of 1991, the Chaire [[Étienne Gilson]] at the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]], March, 2011, and visiting fellowships at [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] in 1997 and the [[Humboldt Universität]], Berlin (with the [[Romano Guardini]] Stiftung) in 2012.

Joseph O’Leary is editorial assistant to The Japan Mission Journal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oriens.or.jp/jmj/jmj.html |title= The Japan Mission Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; which often publishes articles of interreligious interest, and is a regular participant in the Tokyo Buddhist Discussion Group. He frequently attends academic conferences, including the quadrennial Origenianum and Gregory of Nyssa conferences, the Oxford Patristic Conference, the biennial Enrico Castelli conference in philosophy of religion ([[University of Rome La Sapienza]]), the International James Joyce Symposium, the International Association for the Study of Irish Literatures, the International Association for Buddhist Studies, and many conferences held at [[Cerisy-la-Salle]] in [[Normandy]].

With [[Richard Kearney]] and [[William Desmond (philosopher)|William Desmond]], O'Leary was named one of "three Irish Philosophers plying their trade abroad" in [[Irish Times]] (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/into-the-heart-of-darkness-1.366753 |title=Three Cork Philosophers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study of Literature==

Studying English and French literature under Professors Peter Connolly and [[Brendan Devlin]] at Maynooth, O’Leary was particularly influenced by the Geneva School critics such as [[Georges Poulet]] and [[Jean Starobinski]].

Returning to academic involvement with literature in 1988 he focused in his teaching on [[Henry James]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Yeats]]. [[James Joyce|Joyce]], and [[Beckett]]. [[Derrida]], [[Lacan]], and [[Blanchot]] became key theoretical references. In addition to English Literature he taught courses on European culture and on the Bible as literature. He remains concerned with the theological significance of modernist literature and is currently working on a book on Joyce from this perspective.

==Study of Theology==

In his graduate studies in theology at Maynooth, O’Leary specialized in patristics, working on Augustine's [[De Trinitate]] (with much reference to Augustine's dialogue with Plotinus) for his doctoral thesis. In Paris he attended courses on patristics by [[Pierre Nautin]] and [[Charles Kannengiesser]]. Discussing [[Heidegger]] and theology with [[Jean Beaufret]], [[François Fédier]], [[François Vezin]], [[Emmanuel Martineau]], [[Jean-François Courtine]], [[Jean-Luc Marion]], [[Stanislas Breton]], [[Jean Greisch]], and [[Maria Villela-Petit]], he developed a critical approach to patristic tradition drawing on the Heideggerian project of overcoming metaphysics. With [[Richard Kearney]] he organized a seminar at the Irish College, Paris, on 24 June 1979,  in which [[Beaufret]], [[Ricoeur]], and [[Emmanuel Levinas]] participated, and which led to the publication of ''Heidegger te la question de Dieu'' (Grasset, 1980; 2nd ed., PUF 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.puf.com/Quadrige:Heidegger_et_la_question_de_Dieu | title= Heidegger et la question de Dieu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heideggerian approach was spelled out programmatically in his first book, ''Questioning Back: The Overcoming of Metaphysics in Christian Tradition'' (Minneapolis: Winston-Seabury 1985),  which also showed the influence of Derrida and of his first encounters with [[Buddhist philosophy]]. This book sketches a strategy for rereading Christian texts in a counter-metaphysical key. Though convinced of the truth and validity of classical Christian metaphysical theology, O’Leary is also convinced of the need to ‘step back’ behind it to the ‘matter itself,’ that is, to the phenomenality of the biblical events in the horizons of contemporary understanding. Drawing on Heidegger to renew the old questions of [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and [[Harnack]] about the patristic synthesis of the Bible and Greek thought, he advocates a deconstructive method of reading patristic texts that brings out the tensions and flaws in the Athens-Jerusalem syntheses as they show up in the texture of the writing of [[Origen]], [[Gregory of Nyssa]], and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. He has since published a number of essays on these patristic authors, in particular a book-length study, Christianisme et philosophie chez Origène (Paris: Éditions du Cerf, ‘Philosophie &amp; Théologie,’ 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.editionsducerf.fr/librairie/livre/7726/christianisme-et-philosophie-chez-origene | title= Christianisme et philosophie chez Origène}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of religious pluralism comes to the fore in his second book, ''La vérité chrétienne à l'âge du pluralisme religieux'' (Éditions du Cerf, ‘Cogitatio Fidei,’ 1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.editionsducerf.fr/librairie/livre/1923/verite-chretienne-a-l-age-du-pluralisme-religieux-la | title=La Vérité chrétienne à l'âge du pluralisme religious}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its rewritten English version, ''Religious Pluralism and Christian Truth'' (Edinburgh University Press, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/book/9780748607273?template=reviews&amp; | title=Religious Pluralism and Christian Truth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He attempts to tackle this theme with philosophical finesse in a critical dialogue with Derrida.

Conceiving theology as a play of reflective judgment in a mobile and pluralistic context, O’Leary explored the possibilities of a Buddhist-inspired theological conventionalism in ''L’art du jugement en théologie'' (Éditions du Cerf, ‘Cogitatio Fidei,’ 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.editionsducerf.fr/librairie/livre/2019/l-art-du-jugement-en-theologie| title= L’art du jugement en théologie}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in ''Conventional and Ultimate Truth: A Key for Fundamental Theology'' (University of Notre Dame Press, ‘Thresholds in Philosophy and Theology,’ ed. Jeffrey Bloechl and Kevin Hart, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://undpress.nd.edu/books/P03162?keywords=odozor| title= Conventional and Ultimate Truth: A Key for Fundamental Theology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter book expounds a basic method under the rubrics of reflective judgment and conventional truth. Then it visits seven loci that challenge theological thinking today: modernist literature, metaphysics and its overcoming, Scripture, religious experience, negative theology, religious pluralism, and dogma. In each case classical paradigms are unsettled and a more modest and flexible path of reflection and articulation is limned.

These volumes on fundamental theology advance a view of doctrinal language that is increasingly influenced by the Buddhist dyad of conventional and ultimate truth. The basic thesis is that religious traditions can function as vehicles of ultimacy, but that to do so authentically and effectively they need to fully recognize their conventional status as linguistic constructions embedded in history. Warding off nominalism and relativism, O’Leary argues against Derrida and Western interpreters of [[Nagarjuna]] on the notion of truth, in order to uphold the objective reference of doctrinal statements despite their conventional fabric.

Further fruits of O’Leary's engagement with Buddhist philosophy are his Étienne Gilson lectures at the Institut Catholique de Paris, 2011 (published as Philosophie occidentale et concepts bouddhistes, PUF, 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puf.com/Autres_Collections:Philosophie_occidentale_et_concepts_bouddhistes | title=Philosophie occidentale et concepts bouddhistes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his forthcoming commentary on the Vimalakirti Sutra for the collection ‘Christian Commentaries on Non-Christian Sacred Texts’ (ed. Catherine Cornille).

'''Józef Gołuchowski''' (1797–1858) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]].&lt;ref name=Goluchowski/&gt;

Gołuchowski, a professor at [[Vilnius University]], was co-creator of the [[Romanticism in Poland|Polish Romanticist]] "national philosophy."  He preached the concept of the [[nation]] as a creation of [[God]], with a peculiar "national spirit," that realized the ideal of a hierarchical society in which each individual is a necessary fragment of the whole.  He opposed 18th-century materialist philosophy from an irrationalist position. In the [[theory of knowledge]], he preached the primacy of feeling and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] over [[reason]].&lt;ref name=Goluchowski/&gt;

Krishna |title=Muktika Upanishad |publisher=The Theosophical Publishing House |location=Chennai |url=http://www.vedarahasya.net/muktika.htm |accessdate=27 June 2018 |ref=Sloka 18-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
 
== Patanjali ==

The 34 [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] of the fourth chapter deal with impressions left by our endless cycles of birth and the rationale behind the necessity of erasing such impressions. It portrays the [[yogi]], who has attained ''kaivalya'', as an entity who has gained independence from all bondages and achieved the absolute true consciousness or ''ritambhara prajna'' described in the Samadhi Pada.

"…Or, to look from another angle, the power of pure [[consciousness]] settles in its own pure nature."
''—Kaivalya Pada: Sutra 34.''

"Only the minds born of meditation are free from [[karmic]] impressions."
—''Kaivalya Pada: Sutra 6.''

"Since the desire to live is [[eternity|eternal]], impressions are also beginningless.
The impressions being held together by [[cause]], [[Causality|effect]], [[wikt:basis|basis]] and [[wikt:support|support]], they disappear with the disappearance of these four."
—''Kaivalya Pada: Sutra 10-11.''

== Upanishads ==

The terms kevala, kaivalya, or kaivalya-mukti are encountered in the [[Upanishad]]s, including the ''[[Śvetāśvatara]]'' (I and VI) ''[[Kaivalya Upanishad|Kaivalya]]'' (25), the ''[[Amṛtabindu]]'' (29) and the ''[[Muktikā]]'' (1.18, 26, 31) Upanishads .&lt;ref&gt;P. 130 ''Astavakragita: The Song of the Self Supreme'' edited by Radhakamal Mukherjee&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Muktika]]'' Upanishad (sloka 1.18-29) as explained by [[Rama]] to [[Hanuman]], as the most superior form of [[Moksha]] being the essence of all Upanishads, and higher than the four types of Mukti namely: Salokya, Saameepya, Sarupya, &amp; Sayujya &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Warrier |first1=Dr. A. G. Krishna |title=Muktika Upanishad |publisher=The Theosophical Publishing House |location=Chennai |url=http://www.vedarahasya.net/muktika.htm |accessdate=27 June 2018 |ref=Sloka 18-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In section 2 of the same Upanishad, Rama mentioned that Kaivalya-Mukti is the ultimate liberation (both [[jivanmukti]] and [[videha-mukti]]) from prarabdha karma and it can be attained by everyone through studying the 108  authentic Upanishads thoroughly from a realized guru, which will destroy the three forms of bodies (gross, subtle and causal) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Warrier |first1=Dr. A. G. Krishna |title=Muktika Upanishad |publisher=The Theosophical Publishing House |location=Chennai |url=http://www.vedarahasya.net/muktika.htm |accessdate=27 June 2018 |ref=Sloka 18-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The ''[[Yogatattva]]'' Upanishad (16-18) reads, "Kaivalya is the very nature of the self, the supreme state (paramam padam). It is without parts and is stainless. It is the direct intuition of the Real-existence, intelligence and bliss. it is devoid of birth, existence, destruction, recognition, and experience. This is called knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;P. 130 ''Astavakragita: The Song of the Self Supreme'' edited by Radhakamal Mukherjee&lt;/ref&gt;

== In later Hinduism ==

Following the rise of Hinduism with the powerful [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in the 14th century, [[Veerashaivism]] experienced growth in southern India.
Some Veerashaiva scholars of the time such as [[Nijaguna Shivayogi]] (c. 1500) attempted to unify Veerashaivism with Shankara's [[Advaitism]].
His best known work is the ''Kaivalya Paddhati'', a collection of [[swara cavhanas]] set to classical [[ragas]].&lt;ref&gt;P. 190 Medieval Indian Literature&lt;/ref&gt;

Other popular writers of this tradition are Nijaguna Shivayogi, [[Shadaksharadeva]](Muppina Shadakshari), Mahalingaranga and Chidanandavadhuta.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
The Kaivalya literature was entirely in the [[Kannada language]].{{dubious|date=June 2013}}

[[Vijnanabhiksu|Vijñānabhiksu]] was a sixteenth-century Vedāntic philosopher. He writes about kaivalya explicitly in the fourth and final chapter of his ''Yogasārasamgraha''.&lt;ref&gt;P. 120 ''[[Unifying Hinduism|Unifying Hinduism: philosophy and identity in Indian intellectual history]]'' By Andrew J. Nicholson&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Assam]], some Hindus call their sect Kaval Dharma.
In this sect, "kevali" is the highest stage at which the bhagat becomes unconscious of everything else except the one all pervading Entity.&lt;ref&gt;P. 43-44 ''Tai-Ahom Religion and Customs'' by Dr. Padmeswar Gogoi&lt;/ref&gt;
Moamara and Kardoiguria Satras as the principal Satras of the Keval sect.

==In Jainism==

Kaivalya also known as [[Kevala Jnana]] means omniscience in Jainism and is roughly translated as absolute knowledge[1] or supreme knowledge.[2]

Kevala jnana is believed to be an intrinsic quality of all souls. This quality is masked by karmic particles that surround the soul. Every soul has the potential to obtain omniscience by shedding off these karmic particles. Jain scriptures speak of twelve stages through which the soul achieves this goal. A soul who has attained kevala jnana is called a kevalin (केवलिन्).[3] According to the Jains, only kevalins can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge.[4]

'''Leonidas Donskis ''' (13 August 1962 – 21 September 2016) was a [[Lithuanian Jews|Jewish-Lithuanian]] philosopher, political theorist, historian of ideas, social analyst, and political commentator, professor of politics and head of "VDU Academia Cum Laude" at [[Vytautas Magnus University]], Honorary Consul of Finland in Kaunas and deputy chairman of the Lithuanian Jewish Community.&lt;ref name="LZB" /&gt; He was also the member of the [[European Parliament]] (MEP) from 2009 to 2014.

As a public figure in [[Lithuania]], he acted as a defender of human rights and civil liberties. In 2004, Donskis has been awarded by the [[European Commission]]  the title of the Ambassador for Tolerance and Diversity in Lithuania. A center-right politician, he has always been opposed to all extreme or exclusionary attitudes and forms of violent politics, and, instead, has been leaning to [[liberalism]] with its advocacy of individual reason and conscience, ability to coexist with democratic programs of other non-exclusive ideologies, and moderation.

He died on 21 September 2016, in [[Vilnius Airport]] of an apparent [[heart attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Su Leonidu Donskiu atsisveikinti bus galima Kaune|url=http://vz.lt/laisvalaikis/akiraciai/2016/09/21/mire-filososofas-leonidas-donskis|website=VZ.lt|accessdate=22 September 2016|language=lt-LT|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LZB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonidas Donskis Dead at Age 54|url=http://www.lzb.lt/en/2016/09/21/leonidas-donskis-dead-at-age-54/|website=www.lzb.lt|accessdate=22 September 2016|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7175">Of the many and varied [[argument form]]s that can possibly be constructed, only very few are '''valid argument forms'''. In order to evaluate these forms, [[Statement (logic)|statements]] are put into [[logical form]]. Logical form replaces any sentences or ideas with letters to remove any bias from content and allow one to evaluate the argument without any bias due to its subject matter.&lt;ref name="MIT Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=May|first=Robert|title=Logical form: its structure and derivation|year=1993|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a [[valid argument]] does not necessarily mean the conclusion will be true. It is valid because if the premises are true, then the conclusion has to be true. This can be proven for any valid argument form using a [[truth table]] which shows that there is no situation in which there are all true premises and a false conclusion.&lt;ref name="context and logical form"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanley|first=Jason|title=Context and Logical Form|journal=Linguistics and Philosophy|date=30 August 2000|volume=23|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Valid syllogistic forms ==
In [[Term logic|syllogistic logic]], there are 256 possible ways to construct [[categorical syllogism]]s using the '''A''', '''E''', '''I''', and '''O''' statement forms in the [[square of opposition]]. Of the 256, only 24 are valid forms. Of the 24 valid forms, 15 are unconditionally valid, and 9 are conditionally valid.

== Valid propositional forms ==

===Modus ponens===
One valid argument form is known as [[modus ponens]], not to be mistaken with [[modus tollens]] which is another valid argument form that has a like-sounding name and structure. Modus ponens (sometimes abbreviated as MP) says that if one thing is true, then another will be. It then states that the first is true. The conclusion is that the second thing is true.&lt;ref name="Johnson Textbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Robert|title=A Logic Book: Fundamentals of Reasoning|year=2006|publisher=Cengage Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is shown below in logical form.
 
:If A, then B
:A
:Therefore B

Before being put into logical form the above statement could have been something like below.

:If Kelly does not finish his homework, he will not go to class
:Kelly did not finish his homework
:Therefore, Kelly will not go to class

The first two statements are the premises while the third is the conclusion derived from them.

===Modus tollens===
Another form of argument is known as [[modus tollens]] (commonly abbreviated MT). In this form, you start with the same first premise as with modus ponens. However, the second part of the premise is denied, leading to the conclusion that the first part of the premise should be denied as well. It is shown below in logical form.

:If A, then B
:Not B
:Therefore not A.&lt;ref name="Johnson Textbook" /&gt;

When modus tollens is used with actual content, it looks like below.

:If the Saints win the Super Bowl, there will be a party in New Orleans that night
:There was no party in New Orleans that night
:Therefore, the Saints did not win the Super Bowl

===Hypothetical syllogism===
Much like modus ponens and modus tollens, [[hypothetical syllogism]] (sometimes abbreviated as HS) contains two premises and a conclusion. It is however, slightly more complicated than the first two. In short, it states that if one thing happens, another will as well. If that second thing happens, a third will follow it. Therefore, if the first thing happens, it is inevitable that the third will too.&lt;ref name="Johnson Textbook" /&gt; It is shown below in logical form.

:If A, then B
:If B, then C
:Therefore if A, then C

When put into words it looks like below.

:If it rains today, I will wear my rain jacket
:If I wear my rain jacket, I will keep dry
:Therefore if it rains today, I will keep dry

===Disjunctive syllogism===
[[Disjunctive syllogism]] (sometimes abbreviated DS) has one of the same characteristics as modus tollens in that it contains a premise, then in a second premise it denies a statement, leading to the conclusion. In Disjunctive Syllogism, the first premise establishes two options. The second takes one away, so the conclusion states that the remaining one must be true.&lt;ref name="Johnson Textbook" /&gt; It is shown below in logical form.

:Either A or B
:Not A
:Therefore B

When used A and B are replaced with real life examples it looks like below.

:Either you will see Joe in class today or he will oversleep
:You did not see Joe in class today
:Therefore Joe overslept

Disjunctive syllogism takes two options and narrows it down to one.

===Constructive dilemma===
Another valid form of argument is known as [[constructive dilemma]] or sometimes just 'dilemma'. It does not leave the user with one statement alone at the end of the argument, instead, it gives an option of two different statements. The first premise gives an option of two different statements. Then it states that if the first one happens, there will be a particular outcome and if the second happens, there will be a separate outcome. The conclusion is that either the first outcome or the second outcome will happen. The criticism with this form is that it does not give a definitive conclusion; just a statement of possibilities.&lt;ref name=" Johnson Textbook" /&gt; When it is written in argument form it looks like below.

:Either A or B
:If A then C
:If B then D
:Either C or D

When content is inserted in place of the letters, it looks like below.

:Bill will either take the stairs or the elevator to his room
:If he takes the stairs, he will be tired when he gets to his room
:If he takes the elevator, he will miss the start of the football game on TV
:Therefore Bill will either be tired when he gets to his room or he will miss the start of the football game

There is a slightly different version of dilemma that uses negation rather than affirming something known as [[destructive dilemma]]. When put in argumentative form it looks like below.

:If A then C
:If B then D
:Not C or not D
:Therefore not A or not B &lt;ref name="mind and language"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elugardo|first=Reinaldo|title=Logical Form and the Vernacular|journal=Mind and Language|date=1 September 2001|volume=16|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, '''misconduct''' is wrongful, improper, or unlawful conduct motivated by premeditated or intentional purpose or by obstinate indifference to the consequences of one's acts. Misconduct can be considered an unacceptable or improper behavior, especially for a professional person. Two categories of misconduct are [[sexual misconduct]] and [[official misconduct]]. In connection with school discipline, "misconduct" is generally understood to be student behavior that is unacceptable to school officials but does not violate criminal statutes, including [[absenteeism]], tardiness, [[bullying]], and inappropriate language. (Special Education Dictionary, 2003, LRP Publications) Misconduct in the  workplace generally falls under two categories. Minor misconduct is seen as unacceptable but is not a criminal offense (e.g. being late, faking qualifications).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |format=PDF |title=Dishonesty in Medical Research |publisher=Medico-legalsociety.org.uk |accessdate=1 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521050439/http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gross misconduct can lead to dismissal (e.g. stealing or sexual harassment).

* "Misconduct" includes something seen as unacceptable as well as criminal offenses e.g. deceptive manipulation.
* "Gross misconduct"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gross Misconduct|work=Access Solicitor|url=http://www.accesssolicitor.com/glossary/employment-law/disciplinary-and-procedures/gross-misconduct/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218073045/http://www.accesssolicitor.com/glossary/employment-law/disciplinary-and-procedures/gross-misconduct/|archivedate=February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; can lead to immediate dismissal because it is serious enough and possibly criminal, e.g. [[stealing]] or [[sexual harassment]].

Misconduct refers to an action, rather than neglecting to take action, or inaction which could be referred to as poor performance.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Examples of gross misconduct==
* Being drunk or under the influence of any drug while on duty
* Illegal drug use or alcohol at work
* Fighting
* Sexual harassment at workplace
* Stealing
* Subjecting people to discrimination
* Falsifying time records
* Falsification of accounts
* Negligence
* Bribery
* Gross insubordination/ disobedience / misappropriation
* Conviction of a felony (in some states)
* Illicit use
* Financial Misconduct

==Financial==
The failure to understand and manage [[ethical]] risks played a significant role in the financial crisis. The difference between bad business decisions and [[business]] misconduct can be hard to determine, and there is a thin line between the ethics of using only financial incentives to gauge performance and the use of holistic measures that include ethics, transparency and responsibility of [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s. From CEO's to traders and brokers, all-too-tempting lucrative financial incentives existed for performance in the financial industry.&lt;br /&gt;
The past widespread financial misconduct led to a call for financial reform. The [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]  was passed in 2010 to increase accountability and transparency in the financial industry and protect consumers from deceptive financial practices.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrell, Fraedrich: ''Business Ethics'', ''eleventh edition'' Ethical Decision Making and Case, Sexual Harassment in Workplace. February 17, 2017. p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; [[Domestic inquiry]]  A domestic inquiry typically follows a ‘show cause’ letter, which is sent to the employee requesting an explanation for the alleged misconduct. If the response is not satisfactory, the employer will move to the more formal domestic inquiry. Domestic inquiry should be carried out as soon as possible following accusations of misconduct and all activities should be formalized and recorded in full. Legally it is important than the investigation be carried out objectively – the investigating officers, for example, should be unconnected to the incident, and the employee should be given full opportunity to state their own case and present evidence in their favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pesaraonline.net/domestic-inquiry.htm|title=Domestic Inquiry|website=pesaraonline.net|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Union representatives or colleagues should be allowed to sit in during the process if the employer requests their presence, although the employee can’t insist on legal representation. An employer may, on the grounds of misconduct inconsistent with the fulfillment of the express or implied conditions of his services, after due inquiry:
# dismiss without notice the employee
# downgrade the employee
# impose any other lesser punishment as he deems just and fit, and where a punishment of suspension without wages is imposed, it shall not exceed a period of two weeks.

[[File:Muenchhausen Herrfurth 7 500x789.jpg|thumb|[[Baron Munchausen]] pulls himself out of a mire by his own hair]]
In [[epistemology]], the '''Münchhausen trilemma''' is a [[thought experiment]] used to demonstrate the impossibility of [[Proof (truth)|proving]] any truth, even in the fields of logic and mathematics. If it is asked how any knowledge is known to be true, proof may be provided. Yet that same question can be asked of the proof, and any subsequent proof. The Münchhausen trilemma is that there are only three options when providing proof in this situation:

* The [[Circular reasoning|circular argument]], in which theory and proof support each other 
* The [[Infinite regress|regressive argument]], in which each proof requires a further proof, ''[[ad infinitum]]'' 
* The [[axiom]]atic argument, which rests on accepted precepts 

The trilemma, then, is the decision among the three equally unsatisfying options.

The name ''Münchhausen-Trilemma'' was coined by the German philosopher [[Hans Albert]] in 1968 in reference to a ''trilemma'' of "[[dogmatism]] versus [[infinite regress]] versus [[psychologism]]" used by [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dogmatismus – unendlicher Regreß – Psychologismus'' Albert, ''Traktat über kritische Vernunft'', 1968, p. 11, cited after
Westermann, ''Argumentationen und Begründungen in der Ethik und Rechtslehre'', 1977, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a  reference to the problem of "[[bootstrapping]]", based on the story of [[Baron Munchausen]] (in German, "Münchhausen") pulling himself and the horse on which he was sitting out of a mire by his own hair.

It is also known as '''Agrippa's trilemma''' after a similar argument by [[Sextus Empiricus]], which was attributed to [[Agrippa the Skeptic]] by [[Diogenes Laërtius]]. Sextus' argument, however, consists of five (not three) "modes". Popper in his original 1935 publication mentions neither Sextus nor Agrippa, but attributes his trilemma to [[Jakob Fries]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Nola, "Conceptual and Non-Conceptual Content", in : ''Karl Popper: A Centenary Assessment'' vol 2, 2006, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary [[epistemology]], advocates of [[coherentism]] are supposed to accept the "circular" horn of the trilemma; [[foundationalism|foundationalists]] rely on the axiomatic argument. The view that accepts infinite regress is called [[infinitism]].

== Agrippa and the Greek skeptics ==
The following [[Trope (philosophy)|tropes]] for Greek skepticism are given by [[Sextus Empiricus]], in his ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism''.  According to Sextus, they are attributed only "to the more recent skeptics" and by [[Diogenes Laërtius]]  attributed to Agrippa.&lt;ref name="diog1"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The tropes are:

* '''Dissent'''&amp;nbsp;– undecidable dissension, resulting in an inability to choose or exclude anything
* '''Progress ''ad infinitum'''''&amp;nbsp;– all proof requires some further proof, and so on to infinity
* '''Relation'''&amp;nbsp;– the object is considered only in terms of how it appears to the subject and in its relations to other things
* '''Assumption'''&amp;nbsp;– a premise is simply assumed without proof
* '''[[Circular definition|Circularity]]'''&amp;nbsp;– the truth asserted involves a vicious circle (see [[regress argument]], known in [[scholasticism]] as "diallelus")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|dia/llhlos|διάλληλος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[165] According to the mode deriving from dispute, we find that undecidable dissension about the matter proposed has come about both in ordinary life and among philosophers.  Because of this we are not able to choose or to rule out anything, and we end up with suspension of judgment. [166] In the mode deriving from infinite regress, we say that what is brought forward as a source of conviction for the matter proposed itself needs another such source, which itself needs another, and so ''ad infinitum'', so that we have no point from which to begin to establish anything, and suspension of judgment follows. [167] In the mode deriving from relativity, as we said above, the existing object appears to be such-and-such relative to the subject judging and to the things observed together with it, but we suspend judgment on what it is like in its nature. [168] We have the mode from hypothesis when the Dogmatists, being thrown back ''ad infinitum'', begin from something which they do not establish but claim to assume simply and without proof in virtue of a concession. [169] The reciprocal mode occurs when what ought to be confirmatory of the object under investigation needs to be made convincing by the object under investigation; then, being unable to take either in order to establish the other, we suspend judgment about both.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Pyrrhōneioi hypotypōseis'' i., from Annas, J., ''Outlines of Scepticism'' [[Cambridge University Press]]. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With reference to these five tropes, the first and third are a short summary of the ten original grounds of doubt which were the basis of the earlier skepticism.&lt;ref name="diog1"/&gt; The three additional ones show a progress in the sceptical system, and a transition from the common objections derived from the fallibility of sense and opinion, to more abstract and metaphysical grounds of doubt.

According to [[Victor Brochard]], "the five tropes can be regarded as the most radical and most precise formulation of skepticism that has ever been given.  In a sense, they are still irresistible today."&lt;ref&gt;Brochard, V., ''The Greek Skeptics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fries' trilemma ==
[[Jakob Friedrich Fries]] formulated a similar trilemma in which statements can be accepted either:&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Fries, Neue oder anthropologische Kritik der Vernunft (1828 to 1831).&lt;/ref&gt;
* dogmatically
* supported by infinite regress
* based on perceptual experience ([[psychologism]])

The first two possibilities are rejected by Fries as unsatisfactory, requiring his adoption the third option. [[Karl Popper]] argued that a way to avoid the trilemma was to use an intermediate approach incorporating some dogmatism, some infinite regress, and some perceptual experience.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, "The Logic of Scientific Discovery", p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

== Albert's formulation ==
The argument proposed by [[Hans Albert]] runs as follows: All of the only three  possible attempts to get a certain justification must fail:
* All justifications in pursuit of "certain" knowledge have also to justify the means of their justification and doing so they have to justify anew the means of their justification. Therefore, there can be no end, only the hopeless situation of infinite regression
* A circular argument can be used to justify, but this sacrifices its validity
* One can stop at self-evidence or common sense or fundamental principles or speaking ''[[ex cathedra]]'' or at any other evidence, but in doing so, the intention to install 'certain' justification is abandoned.

An English translation of a quote from the original German text by Albert is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Albert, H., ''Traktat über kritische Vernunft'', p. 15 (Tübingen: J.C.B. Mohr, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, one has a mere choice between:
# An infinite regression, which appears because of the necessity to go ever further back, but is not practically feasible and does not, therefore, provide a certain foundation.
# A logical circle in the deduction, which is caused by the fact that one, in the need to found, falls back on statements which had already appeared before as requiring a foundation, and which circle does not lead to any certain foundation either.
# A break of searching at a certain point, which indeed appears principally feasible, but would mean a random suspension of the [[principle of sufficient reason]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Albert stressed repeatedly that there is no limitation of the Münchhausen trilemma to deductive conclusions. The verdict concerns also inductive, causal, transcendental, and all otherwise structured justifications. They all will be in vain.

Therefore, certain justification is impossible to attain. Once having given up the classical idea of certain knowledge, one can stop the process of justification where one wants to stop, presupposed one is ready to start critical thinking at this point always anew if necessary.

This trilemma rounds off the classical problem of [[justification (epistemology)|justification in the theory of knowledge]].

The failure of proving exactly any truth as expressed by the Münchhausen trilemma does not have to lead to dismissal of objectivity, as with [[relativism]]. One example of an alternative is the [[fallibilism]] of Karl Popper and Hans Albert, accepting that [[certainty]] is impossible, but that it is best to get as close as possible to truth, while remembering our uncertainty.

In Albert's view, the impossibility to prove any certain truth is not in itself a certain truth. After all, one needs to assume some basic rules of logical inference to derive his result, and in doing so must either abandon the pursuit of "certain" justification, as above, or attempt to justify these rules, etc. He suggests that it has to be taken as true as long as nobody has come forward with a truth which is scrupulously justified as a certain truth. Several philosophers defied Albert's challenge; his responses to such criticisms can be found in his long addendum to his ''Treatise on Critical Reason'' and later articles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2219">'''No Kidding! International''' is an international non-profit social club created for singles and couples who have never had children regardless of the reason. Such people are generally described as "childless" by society at large, but some of their members who are childless by choice prefer the term "[[childfree]]" in order to highlight the voluntary nature of their circumstance. The first chapter of this organization was begun by [[Jerry Steinberg]] (the "Founding Non-Father" of No Kidding!) in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Fusaro, David (April 25, 2007). [http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070425/NEWS/704250422/1326 "Playdates, Podcasts Ready for Child-Free Couples"]. ''The Lakeland Ledger''.&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous chapters in Canada, the United States and several other countries.

The stated purpose of No Kidding! is to give childless and childfree adults a place to share common interests not involving children, as well as to provide the opportunity to make new like-minded friends.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, Naomi (June 21, 2007). [http://www.csindy.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A20918 "No kidding"]. ''Colorado Springs Independent''.&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone who has never been a parent, regardless of the reason, is permitted to join. The club organizes a wide range of activities, including biking, hiking, wine and cheese parties, dinners, Sunday brunches, community theater, and concerts.

The organization has annual conventions where people from all over the U.S. and Canada gather. Conventions were held annually between 2002 and 2006. So far, conventions have been held in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[New Orleans]], [[Seattle]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Toronto]]. In 2010, the convention was in [[Houston]].

The group's founder, as well as representatives of various No Kidding! chapters, have made numerous appearances in international media, as well as in local newspapers, radio shows and TV programs.

[[File:Cover of 1799 edition of Über die Religion.jpg|thumb|Title page of the first edition of ''On Religion'']]

{{distinguish|text=the British magazine [[On Religion (magazine)]]}}
'''''On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despisers''''' (German: ''Über die Religion: Reden an die Gebildeten unter ihren Verächtern'') is a book written by the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768-1834).  Originally published in 1799, two further editions were released in Schleiermacher's lifetime in 1806 and 1831.

== Composition ==
Since the early age of 15, Schleiermacher had been personally grappling with the most significant issues of [[Christology]], particularly his own doubt in regard to the [[Atonement in Christianity|problem of atonement]]. He entered a [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] seminary in [[Barby, Germany|Barby]], Germany in 1785, only to lead to his eventual expulsion for engaging in heretical philosophic discourse. He left for the [[University of Halle]] and completed his first theological examination some five years later. Following his graduation, Schleiermacher took up a teaching post in Berlin in 1793 and joined the Charity Hospital in 1796 as a regular preacher.&lt;ref&gt;Mackintosh, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intellectual climate of Berlin ===
Schleiermacher was writing around the time the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] was in full swing and arguably when the first major transition into [[modernity]] was simultaneously occurring. With the fall of the late Middle Ages and a vigorous discourse taking hold of Western European intellectuals, the fields of art and natural philosophy were flourishing. However, the discourse of theologians, arguably the primary and only discourse of intellectuals for centuries, had taken to its own now minor corner in the universities. This backdrop is evident in the first line of Schleiermacher's text, "It may be an unexpected and even a  marvelous undertaking, that any one should still venture to demand from the very class that have raised themselves above the vulgar, and are saturated with the wisdom of the centuries, attention for a subject so entirely neglected by them. ... Now especially the life of cultivated people is far from anything that might have even a resemblance to religion."&lt;ref&gt;Schleiermacher p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SchleiermacherIntro"&gt;Schleiermacher, pp. vii–xx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
''On Religion'' is divided into five major sections: the Defense (''Apologie''), the Nature of Religion (''Über das Wesen der Religion''), the Cultivation of Religion (''Über die Bildung zur Religion''), Association in Religion (''Über das Gesellige in der Religion, oder über Kirche und Priesterthum''), and the Religions (''Über die Religionen'').

=== Defense (''Apologie'') ===
The Defense (''Apologie'') characterizes the four following speeches by Schleiermacher laying out of his anthropology of religion. He states, "[T]here are two points of view from which everything taking place in man or proceeding from him may be regarded. Considered from the centre outwards, that is according to its inner quality, it is an expression of human nature, based in one of its necessary modes of acting or impulses ... [R]egarded from the outside, according to the definite attitude and form it assumes in particular cases, it is a product of time and history."&lt;ref&gt;Schleiermacher, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Schleiermacher is perhaps best known outside of Germany for being the "father of modern Protestant theology", focusing his attention not on the institutional values of Christianity but on the nature of religious experience from the perspective of the individual and human nature itself, a product most of the prevalence of [[German Romanticism]]. The phrase "cultured despisers" has also seen reuse in scholarship since the authorship of ''On Religion'' in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="SchleiermacherIntro"/&gt;

The '''Platonic Academy''' (also known as the '''Neoplatonic Florentine Academy''')&lt;ref&gt;Peter Burke, ''The Renaissance'', Longmans, 1964, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; was a 15th-century discussion group in [[Florence]], Italy.

==History==
The Neoplatonic Florentine Academy was founded after [[Gemistus Pletho]] reintroduced Plato's thoughts to Western Europe during the 1438–39 [[Council of Florence]]. It was sponsored by [[Cosimo de' Medici]], led by [[Marsilio Ficino]] and supported by Medici until death of [[Lorenzo Medici]]. It was never a formal group but the members considered themselves a modern form of [[Plato]]'s [[Academy]]. Important members were [[Poliziano]], [[Cristoforo Landino]], [[Pico della Mirandola]], and [[Gentile de' Becchi]]. The academy would proceed to translate into Latin all of Plato's works, the [[Enneads]] of [[Plotinus]], and various other [[Neoplatonic]] works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Pico della Mirandola]] became the first Christian scholar to master the Jewish mystical theology of Kabbalah. He attempted to develop a form of syncretism whereby different systems of thought could be harmonized based on shared elements of truth. Pico asserted that even though Platonism and Christianity had different views, they held some truths in common.
An important aspect of Pico’s philosophical thought was his defense of the dignity and liberty of the human being, set forth in [[Oration on the Dignity of Man|On the Dignity of Man]] (1486). Both Ficino and Pico resurrected the humanistic views of ancient Greece. However, the humanism of the Renaissance was more individualistic than the humanism of ancient times.

The biographer [[John Addington Symonds]] speculates that [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] spent time among the members of the Platonic Academy during Buonarroti's early years in Florence, fully absorbing its doctrines and later authoring poems and other works demonstrating agreement with their doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;The Life of Michelangelo, Symonds, J. A., Capricorn Books, 1962, pp. 405-408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Platonic Academy was in fact dissolved soon after death of Lorenzo Medici in 1492. Poliziano and Mirandola died under very mysterious circumstances in 1494. In 2007, the bodies of [[Poliziano]] and Pico della Mirandola were exhumed from St. Mark's Basilica in Florence. Scientists under the supervision of Giorgio Gruppioni, a professor of [[anthropology]] from [[Bologna]], will use current{{when|date=October 2017}} testing techniques to study the men's lives and establish the causes of their deaths. A TV documentary is being made of this research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6920443.stm Medici writers exhumed in Italy]. BBC News, 28 February 2007. Accessed June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
and it was recently announced that these forensic tests showed that both Poliziano and Pico likely died of arsenic poisoning, probably at the order of Lorenzo's successor, Piero de' Medici.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Moore (7 February 2008).

== History ==
A five-year-old Jeanne Kéfer was a daughter of the artist's friend, pianist Gustave Kéfer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/saltedlolly/2845060497/ Portrait of Jeanne Kefer (1885) by Fernand Khnopff (Belgian 1858 - 1923)].

Retrieved 2014-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting had been scheduled to be showcased at [[Les XX]], 1885, in [[Brussels]], but Khnopff had not managed to finish it, and the exhibition took place in 1886.

== Description ==
Jeanne Kéfer is depicted standing on a porch before a closed door with her thumb catching the edge of her bow as she reaches into her coat. The portrait symbolizes the child's vulnerability and uncertainty in facing the outside world. The message is emphasized by the composition itself as the Jeanne's body is framed against the adult-sized door.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=112007 Jeanne Kéfer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001222041/http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=112007 |date=2013-10-01 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1390">'''Publius Egnatius Celer''', (lived c. AD 60), was a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher, who as a result of being a ''[[delator]]'', or informer, in the reign of [[Nero]], was sentenced to death in the reign of [[Vespasian]].

When treason charges were brought against [[Barea Soranus]] in 66, because he had incurred the hatred of Nero, Egnatius Celer, who had formerly been a client and the teacher of Barea Soranus, stood as chief witness against him.  Barea Soranus was condemned to death together with his daughter [[Servilia (1st century)|Servilia]].

Egnatius received great rewards from Nero, but was afterwards accused by [[Musonius Rufus]], another Stoic philosopher, under Vespasian, and fell out from favor.

'''Racial equality''' occurs when [[institution]]s give [[equal opportunity]] to people of all [[race (human categorization)|races]]. In other words, institutions ignore persons' racial [[phenotypic trait|physical traits]] or [[skin color]], and give everyone legally, morally, and politically equal opportunity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/racial-equality |title=Racial Equality - Dictionary definition of Racial Equality |publisher=[[Encyclopedia.com]] |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Western world|Western society]] today, there is more [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] and more [[racial integration|integration]] among races. Initially, attaining equality has been difficult for [[black people|African]], [[Asian people|Asian]], and [[Latino]] people, especially in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Landauro |first=Victor |title=Racial Equality |work=Junior Scholastic |page=10-1 |publisher=[[ProQuest]] |date=26 April 2004 |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[United States]], racial equality, has become a law that regardless of what race an individual is, they will receive equal treatment, opportunity, education, employment, and politics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Background==

===Civil War===
Slavery was the key to the start of the bloodiest and most traumatic war in America's history. The American Civil War was fought from 1861 to 1865. By 1860 one in three persons in the Southern States belonged to another, in a population of twelve million, four million were slaves. In September 1862 Lincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation, which avowed the aim of freeing the slaves in the Confederacy, and made abolition one of the North's central war aims.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Civil War|last=Davies|first=Phil|publisher=Pocket Essentials|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North took the victory. Did the end of the war represent a gain or a loss for the country? The war represents a defeat for freedom simply to be let alone, for the beneficiaries of inherited wealth or those who prefer to live on the margins of society, but a victory for those, like the immigrants from Europe and the newly emancipated blacks, who needed government to provide the necessary conditions for the pursuit of happiness.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Struggle of African American society==

===Post War equality===
Four million slaves were freed by the result of the American Civil War. In a few years later the South's elite white was in control again. Economic power was the main reason. Deprived of control over the means of earning a living, the blacks were forced into dependence on white landowners.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The blacks worked as farm laborers, or as tenants under the sharecropping system. The biggest problem was the blacks were at the mercy of their white bosses, who would tell them how to vote. Segregations of schools, healthcare and housing became entrenched in the South and the black was relegated to the status of second-class citizen.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Health===
The health of many residents differed depended on areas of living. The poor inner-cities did not or lack the necessary health care that was available in outside areas. Many of the inner-city's location was the main cause for this problem. They were isolated from other parts of society which was a large contributor to the poor health of these residents. Also, the overcrowded living conditions added to the poor health of the residents by the spread of infectious diseases.

==Martin Luther King Jr.==
[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] is better known as a civil rights leader in the United States concerning racial equality. Martin Luther King Jr. became one of the greatest leaders due to his stance concerning various mistreated African-American men and women in the South.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=African American Almanac : 400 Years of Triumph, Courage and Excellence|last=Carney|first=Jessie|publisher=Visible Ink Press|year=2011|isbn=9781578593231|location=|pages=45–50|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he played many roles in society and won an award for the movement he conducted. Martin Luther King Jr. not only took part in the [[Montgomery bus boycott]], became a key speaker at the March on Washington, and was one of the youngest individuals to win the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], but he also handled his opinion in a peaceful manner.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; King kept his anger toward the idea of [[Racial segregation|segregation of race]] to himself; however, he did show his passion of equality in his speeches and [[peaceful protest]].

King displayed his very first [[civil rights movement]] by voluntarily taking a stance in the Montgomery bus boycott. The bus boycott had started by [[Rosa Parks]] refusing to give up her seat for a white male after a long and tiring day at work. Thus, after Park's arrest, King gathered the black community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; in hopes for boycotting against the bus, by cutting the use of transportation. This boycott continued on for 382 days. Although, King had to overcome many attacks towards him such as arrest, and violent harassment, the result was their (African-Americans) first victory: black men and women were allowed to ride the buses in Montgomery equally as the whites.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Rosa Parks==
Rosa Parks was born on February 4, 1913 in Montgomery, Alabama. She attended the all-black [[Alabama State College]], and soon worked at [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) as a secretary.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rosa Parks had become an activists by an event that triggered other events to occur. On December 1, 1955&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Parks had taken the bus home from work, when all of a sudden she was being forced to give up her seat for a white male. Rosa Parks had been frustrated of the way black individuals were treated; thus, she refused and was arrested and fined $14.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Parks' refusal and arrest had caused a dilemma for white individuals, especially for the ones that owned the bus business. The Montgomery bus boycott had started to desegregate public transportation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Moreover, Martin Luther King Jr. had gotten involved to not only motivate the mistreated African-American population, but to share his passion of equality. This boycott lasted 382 days and ended on December 21, 1956.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At the end of the bus boycott, both Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. had become national heroes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, the Supreme Court passed a law which declared it unconstitutional to segregate on Montgomery buses.

==Groups and organizations==

===Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)===
Martin Luther King Jr. was the founder of [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]], by having summoned various numbers of black leaders in 1957.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He became the President of this activist group and decided to improve communities by managing peaceful protests and boycotts regarding the social ethics of discrimination and segregation between races.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===National Association of the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)===
First created on February 12, 1909 in Springfield, Illinois.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.naacp.org/oldest-and-boldest/|title=NAACP {{!}} Oldest and Boldest|newspaper=NAACP|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group was against violence that was directed towards African Americans. There objective was to eliminate racial inequality, and guarantee the political, educational, social and economic equality for citizens. Their office was located in New York.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Moorfield Storey was named president, while, Du Bois, was the only African American Director of Publications.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Congress of Racial Equality===
There was a [[civil rights]] group called [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) that came together to fight corruption and segregation in a nonviolent manner. CORE grew profoundly after the 1950s, beginning with [[James Farmer]] who later became the leader of the group and a civil rights activist in 1941. He went back to his "Native South" and visited to a local movie theater, where he came upon the "crow's nest", an area that was reserved for blacks. He opposed the [[Jim Crow laws]]. He realized that his friends and himself supported those laws by what they did in their daily actions. He soon wrote a memo and summoned for the formation of a group of individuals that were powerful from mind and body to be able to take personal nonviolent actions to end [[discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|jstor=1035898|title=The Congress of Racial Equality and Its Strategy on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CORE was established in 1942 in Chicago. It was a branch of a "Peace-Lover" organization, which was called the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] (FOR). CORE used nonviolent actions procedures that involved sit-ins, which were done in lunch counters in Chicago. By 1947, CORE contributed with an interracial bus ride across the upper part of the South. They were testing state buses that the [[U.S Supreme Court]] ordered to be desegregated, which was the ''[[Morgan v. Virginia]]'' decision in 1946. This led to some success for the facilities that were testing out the orders they were given, but it didn't grab much attention especially in the national level, which was their main goal. By 1960, there was a new wave of nonviolent [[direct action]] protests that initiated through the student [[sit-in movement]]. CORE's national director James Farmer repeated the [[Journey of Reconciliation]]. Another Supreme Court ruling, ''[[Boynton v. Virginia]]'' (1960), ordered a stop to segregation in the interstate bus terminals. That came to be the Freedom Rides. The [[Freedom Riders]] traveled deep into the south and were attacked by segregationists along Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;KIRK, JOHN A. "Please Help Us": The Fort Smith Congress Of Racial Equality Chapter, 1962-1965." Arkansas Historical Quarterly 73.3 (2014): 293-317. Academic Search Complete. Web. 5 Apr. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

CORE began in the North and was mainly concentrated in public areas. About two decades ago, the North had segregated spots where blacks were not allowed. Those places, for example, were restaurants, bowling alleys, skating rinks, and barber shops. More successful efforts were the work settings where there were some experiments with interracial workers and in housing co-operatives. CORE's main focus was to increase public recognition in the north. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, CORE moved to the border states of Missouri, Maryland, and Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Rich, Marvin. "The Congress of Racial Equality and Its Strategy". ''The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' 357 (1965): 113–118. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accomplishments of CORE and NAACP=== 
In the first few weeks of April the two groups CORE and NAACP combined forces to make a change in racial equality. Both the groups protesters constructed a plan to shut down construction of the city's Municipal Services Building, by marching in front of Mayor James Tate's North Philadelphia row house.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas|year=2004|title=Affirmative Action from Below: Civil Rights, the Building Trades, and the Politics of Racial Equality in the Urban North, 1945-1969|url=http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2068/central/docview/224893942/fulltext/D9AE847082174E94PQ/1?accountid=40611|journal=The Journal of American History|volume=|pages=145-173|via=ProQuest Central}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many protesters had engaged in various fights involving police and white unionists.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Moreover, the two groups had caused many debates to open up regarding racial politics, discrimination, and employment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Technique ====
CORE's technique was always nonviolence as the method of fighting [[racial injustice]]. CORE was the first organization to use nonviolent actions in order to stop many issues that affected the black community. The student sit-ins started in February 1960. Within the year, 130 eating locations opened up in the southern communities. They were interested in how CORE approached the issue of segregation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ucf.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/ucf%253A4978|title=This is CORE. {{!}} ucf.digital.flvc.org|website=ucf.digital.flvc.org|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Expansion ====
CORE grew in the early 1940s, but continued to be composed of small groups. They persisted in being small because of the students who were part of the organization. The students would graduate and move away. Also, others were fighting for a specific cause and once the issue has been dealt with, they disappeared. CORE was only a voluntary organization; there was no paid staff.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Main goals ====
In the South:
*[[Desegregation]]
*[[Voter registration]]

In the North:
*Better jobs
*Better housing
*[[School integration in the United States|School integration]]

Many outsiders started to notice the efforts of the group. They supported them and started the Freedom Rides.  CORE was more involved in the [[Black Power]] movement around the mid-1960s. Then things shifted to integration and nonviolent actions toward the organization of communities, the separation of the people, and Black Power. Also, as whites and blacks started to work together to fight over the dilemmas of segregation, white liberals weren't fond of the idea that they were working together. CORE's issues changed over time, so they worked on different actions that would come up.

==Protests==

===Sit-ins===
[[Sit-in]]s, the oldest technique, have been used by CORE the most. CORE divided people into three different groups: one with all black individuals, one with all whites, and one that was interracial. These three different groups would go to a segregated eating area before the busiest hour and wait to be attended quietly. This was used to open up restaurants, and was later used for other locations.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

===Standing in line===
This was used at cafeterias, ticket booths, and other places where one stands in a line in order to be served. If someone is refused, the CORE members who might be in line before him/her will also refuse to step out of line and interrupt service. CORE did this at movie theaters in Kentucky, and at a swimming pool at Palisades Amusement Park in New Jersey. This technique was also important for stopping segregation.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==In the twenty-first century==

===Attitudes===
Since 1942, two particular issues have evolved in racial equality.  One is the handling of blacks to ensure equality, which was favored by the white community, and the other is the differences between southerners and non-southerners. These two issues were observed by the [[National Opinion Research Center]] (NORC). They made questions that plotted five main topics that targeted blacks at the time. The five points that affected racial equality and tracked during the years 1965–1980 were ''year, region, cohort, and education''.&lt;ref name=Case&gt;Case, Charles E., and Andrew M. Greeley. "Attitudes Toward Racial Equality." Humboldt Journal of Social Relations 16.1 (1990): 67-94. ProQuest. Web. 1 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Many educational systems in the south and non-southern areas were in favor of segregated educational institutions among blacks. They also didn't want blacks near their neighborhood or [[interracial marriage]]s to happen.&lt;ref name=Case/&gt;

==Laws==

===Thirteenth Amendment===
The abolishment of slavery in all states.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Edward|year=2014|title=THE ORIGINS OF CIVIL RIGHTS IN AMERICA.|url=http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2240/ehost/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=146eced3-29c2-4279-8bd6-dfaf5495365f%40sessionmgr4006&amp;hid=4207&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=100183276&amp;db=fth|journal=Case Western Reserve Law Review|volume=64|pages=755-816|via=EBSCO host}}{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Fourteenth Amendment=== 
Allowed citizenship to individuals that were born in the United States such as Native Americans and African Americans. It also stops any other state to pass their own law which will violate this amendment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It prohibits states from opposing any person's "life, liberty or property, without law coming forward on the individual" or to "deny to any person within its authority the equal protection of the laws."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Fifteenth Amendment=== 
Allowed African Americans to vote.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Civil Rights Act 1866===
Granted citizenship to individuals without discriminating or viewing race, color, or the previous act of being a slave.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  

===Jim Crow laws=== 
In Southern States, a law that enforced a separation of blacks and whites from public facilities such as employment, housing, education, politics, military service, sports, and business.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2068/central/docview/1691151968/EDA27E55285B4979PQ/1?accountid=40611|title=SAVING THE DREAM FOR ALL|last=Higginbotham|first=Michael|date=2014|work=|access-date=9 December 2016|via=ProQuest Central}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a separate but equal rank was given to the African Americans; also, it was not violating any laws that the government had made of the United States.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

{{For|other uses of the word "charm"|Charm (disambiguation)}}

'''Superficial charm''' (or '''insincere charm''' or '''glib charm''') is the tendency to be smooth, engaging, charming, slick and verbally facile.&lt;ref&gt;Hare's checklist, as cited in {{cite book |title=Psychopathy: antisocial, criminal, and violent behavior |authorlink=Theodore Millon |first=Theodore |last=Millon |first2=Erik |last2=Simonsen |first3=Morten |last3=Birket-Smith |first4=Roger D. |last4=Davis |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |year=2002 |page=173 |isbn=1-57230-344-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase often appears in lists of attributes of [[psychopath]]ic personalities, such as in [[Hervey M. Cleckley]]'s ''[[The Mask of Sanity]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| last=Cleckley | first=Hervey | accessdate= 14 November 2009 | url= http://www.cassiopaea.org/cass/sanity_1.PdF
| title = The Mask of Sanity | publisher = Emily S. Cleckley
| edition= 5th | year=1988 | isbn= 0-9621519-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert D. Hare]]'s [[Hare Psychopathy Checklist]].&lt;ref&gt;Hare, Robert D. (1991). "The Hare Psychopathy Checklist" (Revised). (North Tonawanda, NY: Multi-Health Systems)&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated expressions are "[[#Charm offensive|charm offensive]]", "turning on the charm" and "[[Superficiality|superficial]] [[smile]]".

== Early history ==
[[Classical rhetoric]] had early singled out the critical category of the superficial charmer, whose merit was purely verbal, without underlying substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M. L. |last=Clarke |first2=D. H. |last2=Berry |title=Rhetoric at Rome: A Historical Survey |year=1996 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |page=146 |isbn=0-415-14155-9 |edition=Rev. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychopathic charm ==
Contemporary interest in superficial charm goes back to [[Hervey M. Cleckley]]'s classic study (1941) of the sociopath: since his work it has become widely accepted that the sociopath/psychopath was characterised by superficial charm and a disregard for other people's feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bella |last=DePaulo |first2=Leah |last2=Wilson |title=The Psychology of Dexter |location=Dallas |publisher=Smart Pop |year=2010 |page=7 |isbn=978-1-935251-97-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hare, "Psychopathic charm is not in the least shy, self-conscious, or afraid to say anything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/zine2/narcissism/psychopathy_checklist.html |title=Antisocial Personality, Sociopathy, and Psychopathy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818085421/http://www.angelfire.com/zine2/narcissism/psychopathy_checklist.html |archivedate=2010-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Subsequent studies have refined, but not perhaps fundamentally altered, Cleckley's initial assessment. In the latest diagnostic review, Cleckley's mix of intelligence and superficial charm has been redefined to reflect a more deviant demeanour, talkative, slick, and insincere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. F. |last=Salekin |first2=D. R. |last2=Lynam |title=Handbook of Child and Adolescent Psychopathology |year=2010 |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |page=22 |isbn=978-1-60623-682-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction can also be drawn between a subtle, self-effacing kind of sociopathic charm,&lt;ref&gt;Jon Ronson, ''[[The Psychopath Test]]'' (2011) p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; and a more expansive, exhilarating spontaneity which serves to give the sociopath a sort of animal magnetism.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Stout, ''The Sociopath Next Door'' (2005) pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workplace ===
{{Main|Psychopathy in the workplace}}

The authors of the book [[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]] describe a five phase model of how a typical workplace [[psychopath]] climbs to and maintains [[Power (social and political)|power]]. In phase one (entry), the psychopath will use highly developed [[social skills]] and charm to obtain employment by an organisation.&lt;ref name=Snakes&gt;Baibak, P; [[Robert D. Hare|Hare, R. D]] [[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate psychopaths within organizations may be singled out for rapid promotion because of their polish, charm, and cool decisiveness.&lt;ref name=Financial&gt;Boddy, C. R The Corporate Psychopaths Theory of the Global Financial Crisis Journal of Business Ethics August 2011, Volume 102, Issue 2, pp 255-259&lt;/ref&gt; Their superficial charm may be misinterpreted as charisma.&lt;ref name=Snakes/&gt;&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;https://leb.fbi.gov/2012/november/the-corporate-psychopath
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narcissism ==
{{Main|Narcissism}}

The term also occurs in Hotchkiss' discussion of narcissists: "Their superficial charm can be enchanting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hotchkiss |first=Sandy |authorlink2=James F. Masterson |last2=Masterson |first2=James F. |title=Why Is It Always About You? : The Seven Deadly Sins of Narcissism |year=2003 |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |isbn=0-7432-1428-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For such figures, however, there is no substance behind the romantic gestures, which only serve to feed the narcissist's own ego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Crompton |title=All about Me: Loving a Narcissist |location=London |publisher=Collins |year=2007 |pages=68–69 |isbn=978-0-00-724795-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Narcissists are known as [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] in a charming way, entrapping their victims through a [[façade]] of understanding into suspending their self-protective behaviour and lowering their [[personal boundaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alexander |last=Abdennur |title=Camouflaged Aggression: The Hidden Threat to Individuals and Organizations |year=2000 |pages=87 and 156 |location=Calgary |publisher=Detselig |isbn=1-55059-198-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related is the way [[impostor]]s are able to make people fall in love with them to satisfy their narcissistic needs, without reciprocating in any real sense or returning their feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Otto Fenichel |first=Otto |last=Fenichel |title=The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis |location=London |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |year=1946 |page=374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social chameleons ==

Social [[chameleons]] have been described as adept in [[social intelligence]], able to make a charming good impression, yet at the price of their own true motivations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Goleman]], ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) pp. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; Their ability to manage impressions well often leads to success in areas like the theatre, salesmanship, or politics and diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; But when lacking a sense of their own inner needs, such superficial [[extravert]]s may end up (despite their charm) as rootless chameleons, endlessly taking their social cues from other people.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, for the [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic personality]], the [[attention seeking]] through superficial charm may only reinforce the [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] of the [[True self and false self|real self]] from the public presentation in a vicious circle.&lt;ref&gt;Len Sperry, ''Handbook of diagnosis and treatment of DSM-IV-TR personality disorder'' (2003) p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positive outcomes ==

Superficial charmers, in their more benign manifestations, can produce a variety of positive results, their conversational skills providing light-hearted entertainment in social settings through their ability to please.&lt;ref&gt;Salekin, p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charm offensive ==
{{See also|Public relations|Spin (public relations)}}

A "charm offensive" is a related concept meaning a publicity campaign, usually by politicians, that attempts to attract supporters by emphasizing their charisma or [[trustworthiness]]. The first recorded use of the expression is in the California newspaper ''[[The Fresno Bee Republican]]'' in October 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin, Gary |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/89950.html |title=Charm offensive |work=The Phrase Finder|date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary analogues ==
[[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] explored the destructive consequences of excess charm in stories like "Magnetism", maintaining that charm, for those who had it, had a life of its own, demanding constant use to keep it in peak condition.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], ''Bernice Bobs Her Hair and other stories'' (Penguin 1968) p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics object that there are few objective criteria whereby to distinguish superficial from genuine charm; and that as part of the conventional niceties of politeness, we all regularly employ superficial charm in everyday life:&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Pfohl, ''Images of Deviance and Social Control'' (1985) p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; conveying superficial solidarity and fictitious benevolence to all social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, ''The Stuff of Thought'' (2007) pp. 480–481.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society''''' ({{lang-de|Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit. Untersuchungen zu einer Kategorie der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft}}) is a 1962 book by the philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]]. It was translated into English in 1989 by Thomas Burger and Frederick Lawrence. An important contribution to modern understanding of [[democracy]], it is notable for "transforming media studies into a hard-headed discipline."&lt;ref name=tws11oct01&gt;{{cite news

==The public sphere==
The notion of the "[[public sphere]]" began evolving during the [[Renaissance]] in Western Europe. Brought on partially by merchants' need for accurate information about distant markets as well as by the growth of democracy and individual liberty and popular sovereignty, the ''public sphere'' was a place between private individuals and government authorities in which people could meet and have critical debates about public matters. Such discussions served as a counterweight to political authority and happened physically in face-to-face meetings in coffee houses and cafes and [[Town square|public squares]] as well as in the [[Mass media|media]] in letters, books, drama, and art.&lt;ref name=twsOCT1212&gt;{{cite news | title = Ethos, Poetics, and the Literary Public Sphere | author = David Randall | url = http://mlq.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/69/2/221 | newspaper = Modern Language Quarterly | publisher = Duke University Press | doi = 10.1215/00267929-2007-033 | id = 69(2) | year = 2008 | pages = 221–243 | accessdate = 2009-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas saw a vibrant public sphere as a positive force keeping authorities within bounds lest their rulings be ridiculed. According to [[David Randall]], "In Habermasian theory, the bourgeois public sphere was preceded by a literary public sphere whose favored genres revealed the interiority of the self and emphasized an audience-oriented subjectivity."&lt;ref name=twsOCT1212/&gt;

==Jürgen Habermas==
{{Frankfurt School}}

''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'' was Habermas's first major work. It also satisfied the rigorous requirements for a professorship in Germany; in this system, independent scholarly research, usually resulting in a published book, must be submitted, and defended before an academic committee; this process is known as ''[[Habilitation]]sschrift'' or ''habilitation''. The work was overseen by the [[political scientist]] [[Wolfgang Abendroth]], to whom Habermas dedicated it.

===Habermas' thesis===
[[File:Johann Peter Hasenclever - Das Lesekabinett - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''The Reading Room'' by [[Johann Peter Hasenclever]]]]
Habermas describes the development of a [[bourgeois]] [[public sphere]] in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries as well as its subsequent decline.

The first transition occurred in England, France, the United States, and Germany over the course of 150 years or so from the late seventeenth century. England led the way in the early eighteenth century, with Germany following in the late eighteenth century. Habermas tries to explain the growth and decline of the public sphere by relating political, social, cultural and philosophical developments to each other in a multi-disciplinary approach. Initially, there were monarchical and feudal societies which made no distinction between state and society or between public and private, and which had organized themselves politically around symbolic representation and status. These feudal societies were transformed into a [[bourgeois]] liberal constitutional order which distinguished between the public and private realms; further, within the private realm, there was a bourgeois public sphere for rational-critical political debate which formed a new phenomenon called [[public opinion]]. Spearheading this shift was the growth of a literary public sphere in which the bourgeoisie learned to critically reflect upon itself and its role in society. This first major shift occurred alongside the rise of early non-industrial [[capitalism]] and the philosophical articulation of political liberalism by such thinkers as [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] (See: ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]''), [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], and then [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. The bourgeois public sphere flourished within the early [[laissez-faire]], free-market, largely pre-industrial capitalist order of liberalism from the late eighteenth century to the mid-nineteenth century.

The second part of Habermas' account traces the transition from the liberal bourgeois public sphere to the modern [[mass society]] of the [[Welfare state|social welfare state]]. Starting in the 1830s, extending from the late nineteenth century to the early twentieth century, a new constellation of social, cultural, political, and philosophical developments took shape. [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s critique of Kant's liberal philosophy anticipated the shift, according to Habermas, and this shift came to a philosophical head in [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s astute diagnosis of the contradictions inherent in the liberal constitutional social order. Habermas saw the modified liberalism of [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocqueville]] with their ambivalence toward the public sphere as emblematic manifestations of these contradictions.

Paralleling this philosophical progression against classical liberalism were major socio-economic transformations based on industrialization, and the result was the rise of mass societies characterized by [[consumer capitalism]] in the twentieth century. Clear demarcations between public and private and between state and society became blurred. The bourgeois public sphere was transformed by the increasing re-integration and entwining of state and society that resulted in the modern social [[welfare state]]. This shift, according to Habermas, can be seen as part of a larger [[dialectic]] in which political changes were made in an attempt to save the liberal constitutional order, but had the ultimate effect of destroying the bourgeois public sphere. He highlights the pernicious effects of commercialization and consumerization on the public sphere through the rise of [[mass media]], [[public relations]], and [[Consumerism|consumer culture]]. He delineates how these developments thwarted rational-critical political debate, including political parties functioning in a way that bypassed the public sphere, undermining parliamentary politics.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas (1991). ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a category of Bourgeois Society''. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1991. p. 175-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas drew on the cultural critiques of [[critical theory]] from the [[Frankfurt School]],&lt;ref name=tws11oct03&gt;{{cite news

==Reception==
[[File:Salon de Madame Geoffrin.jpg|thumb|300px|''Reading of the Tragedy 'L'Orphelin de la Chine' in the Salon of Madame Geoffrin'', or ''An Evening at Madame Geoffrin's'' by Lemonnier 1812]] The book was reprinted many times in German and other languages, and has been enormously influential, especially since its translation into English, for scholars of [[political science]], [[media studies]], and [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref name=tws11oct01/&gt; It is also an important work for historians of philosophy and scholars of [[intellectual history]]. After publication, Habermas was identified as an important philosopher of the twentieth century.

Since publication, the ''Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'' has been critiqued for Habermas’s formulation of the concept of a public sphere which he claimed "stood or fell with the principle of universal access ... A public sphere from which specific groups would be ''eo ipso'' excluded was less than merely incomplete; it was not a public sphere at all." (Habermas 1962:85) However, the bourgeois public sphere required as preconditions of entry an excellent education and property ownership – which correlated to membership of the upper classes. Critics have argued that the bourgeois public sphere cannot be considered an ideal form of politics, since the [[public sphere]] was limited to upper-class strata of society and did not represent most of the citizens in these emerging nation-states.

Some critics claim the public sphere, as such, never existed, or existed only in the sense of excluding many important groups, such as the poor, women, slaves, migrants, and criminals. They maintain that the public sphere remains an idealized conception, little changed since Kant, since the ideal is still to a great extent what Habermas might call an unfinished project of modernity. (Cubitt 2005:93)

Similar critiques regarding the exclusivity of the bourgeois public sphere have been made by feminist and post-colonial authors.{{citation needed|reason=who?|date=June 2015}}

{{nihongo|'''Tomonobu Imamichi'''|今道 友信|Imamichi Tomonobu}} (November 19, 1922 – October 13, 2012) was a [[Japanese philosopher]] who studied [[Chinese philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Mainichi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mainichi.jp/select/news/20121017k0000m060019000c.html|script-title=ja:訃報:今道友信さん８９歳＝東大名誉教授エコエティカ提唱|date=16 October 2012|publisher=''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]''|language=Japanese|accessdate=17 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130112022432/http://mainichi.jp/select/news/20121017k0000m060019000c.html|archivedate=12 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Life==
Imamichi taught in Europe (Paris and Germany) as well as in Japan (he was also emeritus professor of the [[University of Palermo]]). Beginning in 1979 he was the president of the ''[[Centre International pour l'Étude Comparée de Philosophie et d'Esthétique]]'' and after 1997 of the [[International Institute of Philosophy]]. In 1976 he founded the journal ''Aesthetics''.

He translated [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' into Japanese (in 1972) and has written numerous books in Japanese. Imamichi was a supporter of [[transculturation|communication between cultures]]. He characterizes [[Western philosophy]] as an attempt to achieve a God's eye view (''das in-dem-Gott-sein''; to be in the being of God) and [[Eastern philosophy]] as an attempt to be in the world (''das in-der-Welt-sein''). Imamichi sees in both stances two incomplete and complementary [[humanism]]s, and observes that since the publication of ''[[The Book of Tea]]'', some Western philosophers have adopted a more Eastern stance while other Eastern philosophers have attempted to reach the Absolute or the Eternal.

Tomonobu Imamichi was the father of guitarist and songwriter [[Tomotaka Imamichi]], pianist Nobuko Kawaguchi, biologist Yukiko Imamichi and psychologist Tomoaki Imamichi.

'''Walter Johannes Stein''' (6 February 1891, in [[Vienna]] – 7 July 1957, in [[London]]) was an [[Austria]]n philosopher, [[Waldorf school]] teacher, [[Grail]] researcher, and one of the pioneers of [[anthroposophy]].

==Biography==
Of [[Jewish]] descent,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], ''Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity'', [[NYU Press]] (2003), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Stein studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy at Vienna University, before completing a doctorate in philosophy at the end of the [[First World War]], having continued work on it throughout his service in an artillery unit in the war. He became a personal student of [[Rudolf Steiner]] from about the age of 21, and enjoyed the unofficial supervision of Steiner while writing his dissertation. Broadly speaking, the dissertation was an attempt to write a [[epistemology|theory of cognition]] for spiritual knowledge.

After the [[First World War]], Stein assisted Steiner in promoting [[Social Threefolding]]. When it became apparent in 1919 that these efforts were not going to succeed, Steiner asked Stein to teach history and German literature at the first [[Waldorf School]] in [[Stuttgart]]. It was as part of this work that Stein began his research on the [[Grail]], which culminated in 1928 with his book ''The Ninth Century and the Holy Grail''.&lt;ref&gt;First published in German as ''Weltgeschichte im Lichte des heiligen Gral. Das neunte Jahrhundert''; the latest English edition is ''The Ninth Century and the Holy Grail'', Temple Lodge Publishing 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, he attempted to identify historical people and events represented in the Grail epic and to interpret ''Parzival'' as an esoteric document representing the human path of inner development. Stein also wrote various articles on these themes.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Johannes Stein, ''Der Tod Merlins''. Published in English as ''The Death of Merlin, Arthurian Myth and Alchemy'', Floris Books 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein lectured extensively on anthroposophy and related themes from the early 1920s onward, giving up to 300 lectures a year. He also contributed many articles to ''The Present Age'' and similar periodicals, and wrote a number of short books including ''The Principle of Reincarnation'', ''Gold: in History and in Modern Times'', ''West-East: A Study in National Relationships'', ''Labour: in History and in Modern Times'', and ''The British: Their Psychology and Destiny''. Stein claimed to have had a spiritual breakthrough in 1924 using the meditative methods of Steiner and to have attained some insight into his own karmic background.&lt;ref name=Tautz&gt;[[Johannes Tautz]], ''Walter Johannes Stein: A Biography''. Temple Lodge Press 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein moved to London in 1933, at the invitation of the theosophist-turned-anthroposophist [[Daniel Nicol Dunlop]]. Dunlop was director of the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers' Association (BEAMA), and chairman of the executive council of the World Power Conference. Dunlop had called Stein to London to take up a post in research for the World Power Conference; he had apparently founded the World Power Conference as a precursor to a World Economic Conference, and he had called Stein to London to assist him especially with this latter, more ambitious, project. Dunlop died in 1935 before this plan could be brought to fruition, but Stein did bring about Dunlop's wish for an independent cultural journal in the form of ''The Present Age''. Stein, having taken up various studies in economics, geography, and geology for his collaborative work with Dunlop, was able to bring together the results of this work in a special issue of the journal under the title ''The Earth as a Basis of World Economy''. The publication of the journal ceased with the start of the Second World War.

During and after the Second World War Stein made many connections in government circles in Britain, as well as with the Dutch and Belgian royal families. 

==Fictionalization==

Stein is one of the chief characters in Trevor Ravenscroft's books ''The Spear of Destiny'' and ''The Cup of Destiny''. Though Ravenscroft claimed that he had been a pupil of Stein's, investigative reporter Eric Wynants discovered the Stein/Ravenscroft connection was a complete fabrication while interviewing Ravenscroft for an article in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;According to Wynants, Ravenscroft admitted during their interview that he had never actually met W.J. Stein, but "talked to him only via a medium". Alec Macellan, ''The Secret of the Spear – The Mystery of The Spear of Longinus'' p.116&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Werner Karl Heisenberg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|z|ən|b|ɜr|ɡ}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/heisenberg "Heisenberg"]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|ˈhaɪzn̩ˌbɛɐ̯k|lang}}; 5 December 1901 – 1 February 1976) was a [[Germans|German]] [[theoretical physicist]] and one of the key pioneers of [[quantum mechanics]]. He published his work in 1925 in a breakthrough [[Über quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen|paper]]. In the subsequent series of papers with [[Max Born]] and [[Pascual Jordan]], during the same year,  this  [[matrix mechanics|matrix formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] was substantially elaborated.  He is known for the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], which he published in 1927. Heisenberg was awarded the 1932 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for the creation of [[quantum mechanics]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1932 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-07}} This source explains that Heisenberg actually received his Nobel Prize for 1932 one year later, in 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also made important contributions to the theories of the hydrodynamics of [[turbulent flow]]s, the atomic nucleus, [[ferromagnetism]], [[cosmic rays]], and [[subatomic particles]], and he was instrumental in planning the first West German [[nuclear reactor]] at [[Karlsruhe]], together with a [[research reactor]] in [[Munich]], in 1957. He was a principal scientist in the [[German nuclear weapon project|Nazi German nuclear weapon project]] during [[World War II]]. He travelled to occupied Copenhagen where he met and discussed the German project with [[Niels Bohr]].

Following World War II, he was appointed director of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics]], which soon thereafter was renamed the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]]. He was director of the institute until it was moved to Munich in 1958, when it was expanded and renamed the [[Max Planck Society|Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics]].

Heisenberg was also president of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Council]], chairman of the Commission for Atomic Physics, chairman of the Nuclear Physics Working Group, and president of the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]].&lt;ref name=formemrs/&gt;

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Werner Karl Heisenberg was born in [[Würzburg]], Germany, to {{ill|Kaspar Ernst August Heisenberg|de|August Heisenberg}},&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|2009|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; a secondary school teacher of [[classical language]]s who became Germany's only ''ordentlicher Professor'' (ordinarius professor) of medieval and [[modern Greek]] studies in the university system, and his wife, Annie Wecklein.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|1992|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heisenberg,Werner 1924 Göttingen - adjusted.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|Heisenberg, Habilitation 1924]]
He studied physics and mathematics from 1920 to 1923 at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]  and the [[University of Göttingen|Georg-August University of Göttingen]]. At Munich, he studied under [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] and [[Wilhelm Wien]]. At Göttingen, he studied physics with [[Max Born]] and [[James Franck]] and mathematics with [[David Hilbert]]. He received his doctorate in 1923, at Munich under Sommerfeld. He completed his [[Habilitation]] in 1924, at Göttingen under Born.&lt;ref name="Werner Heisenberg Biography"&gt;''[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/heisenberg-bio.html Werner Heisenberg Biography]'', ''Nobel Prize in Physics 1932'' Nobelprize.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hentschel 1996"&gt;{{harvnb|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=Appendix F}}; see the entry for Heisenberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Sommerfeld had a sincere interest in his students and knew of Heisenberg's interest in [[Niels Bohr]]'s theories on atomic physics, Sommerfeld took Heisenberg to Göttingen to the [[Bohr Festival]] of June 1922. At the event, Bohr was a guest lecturer and gave a series of comprehensive lectures on quantum atomic physics. There, Heisenberg met Bohr for the first time, and it had a significant and continuing effect on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|1992|pp=127, Appendix A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Powers|1993|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van der Waerden|1968|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heisenberg's [[Thesis|doctoral thesis]], the topic of which was suggested by Sommerfeld, was on [[turbulence]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=W. Heisenberg |title=Über Stabilität und Turbulenz von Flüssigkeitsströmmen |doi=10.1002/andp.19243791502|year=1924|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=379|issue=15|page=577|bibcode = 1924AnP...379..577H }} as cited in {{harvnb|Mott|Peierls|1977|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; the thesis discussed both the stability of [[laminar flow]] and the nature of turbulent flow. The problem of stability was investigated by the use of the [[Orr–Sommerfeld equation]], a fourth order [[linear differential equation]] for small disturbances from laminar flow. He briefly returned to this topic after World War II.&lt;ref name=MottPeierls77_217&gt;{{harvnb|Mott|Peierls|1977|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heisenberg's paper on the anomalous [[Zeeman effect]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heisenberg |first=W. |title=Über eine Abänderung der formalen Regeln der Quantentheorie beim Problem der anomalen Zeeman-Effekte |journal=Z. Phys. |volume=26 |pages=291–307 |year=1924 |doi=10.1007/BF01327336 |bibcode=1924ZPhy...26..291H }} as cited in {{harvnb|Mott|Peierls|1977|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; was accepted as his ''Habilitationsschrift'' ([[Habilitation|Habilitation thesis]]) under [[Max Born]] at Göttingen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mott|Peierls|1977|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his youth he was a member and Scoutleader of the ''Neupfadfinder'', a [[Scouting in Germany|German Scout association]] and part of the [[German Youth Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Heisenberg arrived at Munich in 1919 as a member of Freikorps to fight the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] established a year earlier. Five decades later he recalled those days as youthful fun, like "playing cops and robbers and so on; it was nothing serious at all."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Miller. "137: Jung , Pauli and the pursuit of a scientific obsession." New York: Norton &amp; Company, 2009. p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===

====Göttingen, Copenhagen, and Leipzig====
From 1924 to 1927, Heisenberg was a [[Privatdozent]] at [[Göttingen]]. From 17 September 1924 to 1 May 1925, under an International Education Board [[Rockefeller Foundation]] fellowship, Heisenberg went to do research with [[Niels Bohr]], director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. His seminal paper, ''[[Über quantentheoretischer Umdeutung]]'' was published in September 1925.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kragh, '[[Dirac, Paul Adrien Maurice]] (1902–1984)', [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to Göttingen and with [[Max Born]] and [[Pascual Jordan]], over a period of about six months, developed the [[matrix mechanics]] formulation of [[quantum mechanics]]. On 1 May 1926, Heisenberg began his appointment as a [[Lecturer|university lecturer]] and assistant to Bohr in Copenhagen. It was in Copenhagen, in 1927, that Heisenberg developed his [[uncertainty principle]], while working on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. On 23 February, Heisenberg wrote a letter to fellow physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]], in which he first described his new principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200802/physicshistory.cfm | title=February 1927: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle | publisher=American Physics Society | journal=APS News | date=February 2008 | volume=17 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his paper&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heisenberg|1927}}, cited in {{harvnb|Mott|Peierls|1977|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the uncertainty principle, Heisenberg used the word "''Ungenauigkeit''" (imprecision).&lt;ref name="Werner Heisenberg Biography" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992"&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|1992|p=Appendix A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mott|Peierls|1977|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Heisenberg was appointed ''ordentlicher Professor'' (professor ordinarius) of theoretical physics and head of the department of physics at the [[Leipzig University|University of Leipzig]]; he gave his inaugural lecture there on 1 February 1928. In his first paper published from Leipzig,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heisenberg|1928}}, as cited in {{harvnb|Mott|Peierls|1977|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heisenberg used the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] to solve the mystery of [[ferromagnetism]].&lt;ref name="Werner Heisenberg Biography" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hentschel 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mott|Peierls|1977|pp=226–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Heisenberg's tenure at Leipzig, the high quality of the doctoral students and [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] and research associates who studied and worked with him there is clear from the acclaim many later earned. At various times they included [[Erich Bagge]], [[Felix Bloch]], [[Ugo Fano]], [[Siegfried Flügge]], [[William Vermillion Houston]], [[Friedrich Hund]], [[Robert S. Mulliken]], [[Rudolf Peierls]], [[George Placzek]], [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]], [[Fritz Sauter]], [[John C. Slater]], [[Edward Teller]], [[John Hasbrouck van Vleck]], [[Victor Frederick Weisskopf]], [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], [[Gregor Wentzel]], and [[Clarence Zener]].&lt;ref name=MottPeierls77_227&gt;{{harvnb|Mott|Peierls|1977|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1929, Heisenberg and Pauli submitted the first of two papers laying the foundation for relativistic [[quantum field theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heisenberg|Pauli|1929}}, {{harvnb|Heisenberg|Pauli|1930}}, as cited in {{harvnb|Mott|Peierls|1977|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1929, Heisenberg went on a lecture tour of China, Japan, India, and the United States.&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name=MottPeierls77_227 /&gt; In the spring of 1929, he was a visiting lecturer at the [[University of Chicago]], where he lectured on quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kursunoglu|first1=Behram N.|last2=Wigner|first2=Eugene P.|title=Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac: Reminiscences about a Great Physicist|date=April 26, 1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521386888|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, the British [[Mathematical Physics|mathematical physicist]] [[Paul Dirac|P. A. M. Dirac]] had derived the [[Dirac equation|relativistic wave equation]] of quantum mechanics, which implied the existence of positive electrons, later to be named [[positron]]s. In 1932, from a [[cloud chamber]] photograph of [[cosmic ray]]s, the American physicist [[Carl David Anderson]] identified a track as having been made by a [[positron]]. In mid-1933, Heisenberg presented his theory of the positron. His thinking on Dirac's theory and further development of the theory were set forth in two papers. The first, ''Bemerkungen zur Diracschen Theorie des Positrons (Remarks on Dirac's theory of the positron)'' was published in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heisenberg|1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second, ''Folgerungen aus der Diracschen Theorie des Positrons (Consequences of Dirac's Theory of the Positron)'', was published in 1936.&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heisenberg|Euler|1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Emilio G. |last=Segrè |authorlink=Emilio G. Segrè |title=From X-rays to Quarks: Modern Physicists and Their Discoveries |publisher=W.H. Freeman |year=1980 |isbn=071671146X }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these papers Heisenberg was the first to reinterpret the  [[Dirac equation]] as a "classical" field equation for any point particle of spin ħ/2, itself subject to quantization conditions involving anti-commutators. Thus reinterpreting it as a (quantum) field equation accurately describing  electrons, Heisenberg put matter on the same footing as electromagnetism: as being described by relativistic quantum field equations which allowed the possibility of particle creation and destruction. (Hermann Weyl had already described this in a 1929 letter to Einstein.)

====Matrix mechanics and the Nobel Prize====

[[File:Bohr heisen pauli.jpg|thumb|[[Niels Bohr]], Werner Heisenberg, and [[Wolfgang Pauli]], c. 1935]]

Heisenberg's paper establishing quantum mechanics&lt;ref&gt;W. Heisenberg, ''Über quantentheoretishe Umdeutung kinematisher und mechanischer Beziehungen'', ''Zeitschrift für Physik'', '''33''', 879–893, 1925 (received 29 July 1925). [English translation in: B. L. van der Waerden, editor, ''Sources of Quantum Mechanics'' (Dover Publications, 1968) {{ISBN|0-486-61881-1}} (English title: "Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Kinematic and Mechanical Relations").]&lt;/ref&gt; has puzzled physicists and historians. His methods assume that the reader is familiar with [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]]-Heisenberg transition probability calculations. The main new idea, [[Matrix multiplication#Properties of matrix multiplication|noncommuting matrices]], is justified only by a rejection of unobservable quantities. It introduces the non-[[Commutativity|commutative]] multiplication of [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] by physical reasoning, based on the [[correspondence principle]], despite the fact that Heisenberg was not then familiar with the mathematical theory of matrices. The path leading to these results has been reconstructed in MacKinnon, 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacKinnon |first=Edward |title=Heisenberg, Models, and the Rise of Quantum Mechanics |journal=Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences |volume=8 |pages=137–188 |year=1977 |jstor=27757370 |doi=10.2307/27757370}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the detailed calculations are worked out in Aitchison et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aitchison |first1=Ian J.

In Copenhagen, Heisenberg and [[Hans Kramers]] collaborated on a paper on dispersion, or the scattering from atoms of radiation whose wavelength is larger than the atoms. They showed that the successful formula Kramers had developed earlier could not be based on Bohr orbits, because the transition frequencies are based on level spacings which are not constant. The frequencies which occur in the [[Fourier transform]] of sharp classical orbits, by contrast, are equally spaced. But these results could be explained by a semi-classical [[virtual state]] model: the incoming radiation excites the valence, or outer, electron to a virtual state from which it decays. In a subsequent paper Heisenberg showed that this virtual oscillator model could also explain the polarization of fluorescent radiation.

These two successes, and the continuing failure of the [[Bohr model|Bohr-Sommerfeld model]] to explain the outstanding problem of the anomalous Zeeman effect, led Heisenberg to use the virtual oscillator model to try to calculate spectral frequencies. The method proved too difficult to immediately apply to realistic problems, so Heisenberg turned to a simpler example, the [[anharmonic oscillator]].

The dipole oscillator consists of a [[simple harmonic oscillator]], which is thought of as a [[charged particle]] on a spring, perturbed by an external force, like an external charge. The motion of the oscillating charge can be expressed as a [[Fourier series]] in the frequency of the oscillator. Heisenberg solved for the quantum behavior by two different methods. First, he treated the system with the virtual oscillator method, calculating the transitions between the levels that would be produced by the external source.

He then solved the same problem by treating the anharmonic potential term as a perturbation to the harmonic oscillator and using the [[Perturbation theory|perturbation methods]] that he and Born had developed. Both methods led to the same results for the first and the very complicated second order correction terms. This suggested that behind the very complicated calculations lay a consistent scheme.

So Heisenberg set out to formulate these results without any explicit dependence on the virtual oscillator model. To do this, he replaced the Fourier expansions for the spatial coordinates by matrices, matrices which corresponded to the transition coefficients in the virtual oscillator method. He justified this replacement by an appeal to Bohr's [[correspondence principle]] and the Pauli doctrine that quantum mechanics must be limited to observables.

On 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born this paper to review and submit for publication. When Born read the paper, he recognized the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Abraham Pais |first=Abraham |last=Pais |title=Niels Bohr's Times in Physics, Philosophy, and Polity |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-19-852049-2 |pages=275–279 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he had learned from his study under [[Jakob Rosanes]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1954/born-lecture.pdf Max Born] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019194414/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1954/born-lecture.pdf |date=19 October 2012 }} ''The Statistical Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics'', Nobel Lecture (1954)&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Breslau University]].

Up until this time, matrices were seldom used by physicists; they were considered to belong to the realm of [[pure mathematics]]. [[Gustav Mie]] had used them in a paper on electrodynamics in 1912 and Born had used them in his work on the lattice theory of crystals in 1921. While matrices were used in these cases, the algebra of matrices with their multiplication did not enter the picture as they did in the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Jammer, 1966, pp. 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, [[Albert Einstein]] nominated Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan for the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]],&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, 2004, p. 1004.&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement of the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 was delayed until November 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, 2005, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; It was at that time that it was announced Heisenberg had won the Prize for 1932 "for the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has, [[List of Latin phrases: I#inter alia|inter alia]], led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen".&lt;ref name="nobelprize.org"&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/ The Nobel Prize in Physics 1932].

====SS investigation====
Shortly after the discovery of the [[neutron]] by [[James Chadwick]] in 1932, Heisenberg submitted the first of three papers&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heisenberg|1932 I}}, {{harvnb|Heisenberg|1932 II}}, {{harvnb|Heisenberg|1933 III}}, as cited by {{harvnb|Mott|Peierls|1977|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; on his [[Neutron#Proton – neutron model of the nucleus|neutron-proton model of the nucleus]].&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mott|Peierls|1977|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, Heisenberg was attacked in the press as a "White Jew".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Heisenberg&amp;nbsp;– The Difficult Years: Professor in Leipzig, 1927–1942 |publisher=American Institute of Physics |url=http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p10.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of ''Deutsche Physik'' launched vicious attacks against leading theoretical physicists, including [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] and Heisenberg.&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt; From the early 1930s onward, the [[anti-Semitic]] and anti-theoretical physics movement ''Deutsche Physik'' had concerned itself with [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[theory of relativity]]. As applied in the university environment, political factors took priority over the historically applied concept of scholarly ability,&lt;ref&gt;Beyerchen, 1997, 141–167.&lt;/ref&gt; even though its two most prominent [[supporter]]s were the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Laureates in Physics]] [[Philipp Lenard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beyerchen|1977|pp=79–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johannes Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beyerchen|1977|pp=103–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Werner Heisenberg and Albert Einstein|url = http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/53/7/10.1063/1.1292474|journal = Physics Today|date = 2007-01-12|issn = 0031-9228|pages = 38–42|volume = 53|issue = 7|doi = 10.1063/1.1292474|first = Gerald|last = Holton|bibcode = 2000PhT....53g..38H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There had been many failed attempts to have Heisenberg appointed as professor at a variety of German universities. His attempt to be appointed as the successor to [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] failed because of opposition by the ''Deutsche Physik'' movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Surviving the Swastika: Scientific Research in Nazi Germany|last = Macrakis|first = Kristie|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1993|isbn = 9780195070101|pages = 172}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 1935, the eminent theoretical physicist Sommerfeld, Heisenberg's doctoral advisor at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München]], achieved [[emeritus]] status. However, Sommerfeld stayed in his chair during the selection process for his successor, which took until 1 December 1939. The process was lengthy due to academic and political differences between the Munich Faculty's selection and that of the [[Reichserziehungsministerium]] (REM, Reich Education Ministry) and the supporters of ''[[Deutsche Physik]]'', which was [[anti-Semitic]] and had a bias against [[theoretical physics]], especially [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[theory of relativity]].

In 1935, the Munich Faculty drew up a list of candidates to replace Sommerfeld as ordinarius professor of theoretical physics and head of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Munich. The three candidates had all been former students of Sommerfeld: Heisenberg, who had received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]; [[Peter Debye]], who had received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1936; and [[Richard Becker (physicist)|Richard Becker]]. The Munich Faculty was firmly behind these candidates, with Heisenberg as their first choice. However, supporters of ''Deutsche Physik'' and elements in the REM had their own list of candidates, and the battle dragged on for over four years. During this time, Heisenberg came under vicious attack by the ''Deutsche Physik'' supporters. One attack was published in ''Das Schwarze Korps'', the newspaper of the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS), headed by [[Heinrich Himmler]]. In this, Heisenberg was called a "White Jew" (i.e. an [[Aryan]] who acts like a Jew) who should be made to "disappear".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|pp=152–7 Document #55 ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sl69XGiohsoC&amp;pg=PA152 ’White Jews’ in Science &amp;#x5B;15 July 1937&amp;#x5D]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attacks were taken seriously, as Jews were violently attacked and incarcerated. Heisenberg fought back with an editorial and a letter to Himmler, in an attempt to resolve this matter and regain his honour.

At one point, Heisenberg's mother visited Himmler's mother. The two women knew each other, as Heisenberg's maternal grandfather and Himmler's father were rectors and members of a Bavarian hiking club. Eventually, Himmler settled the Heisenberg affair by sending two letters, one to SS [[Gruppenführer]] [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and one to Heisenberg, both on 21 July 1938. In the letter to Heydrich, Himmler said Germany could not afford to lose or silence Heisenberg, as he would be useful for teaching a generation of scientists. To Heisenberg, Himmler said the letter came on recommendation of his family and he cautioned Heisenberg to make a distinction between professional physics research results and the personal and political attitudes of the involved scientists.&lt;ref name="Goudsmit, Samuel A. 1986 pp 117 -119"&gt;Goudsmit, Samuel A. ''ALSOS '' (Tomash Publishers, 1986) pp 117 -119.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Wilhelm Müller (physicist)|Wilhelm Müller]] replaced Sommerfeld  at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Müller was not a theoretical physicist, had not published in a physics journal, and was not a member of the [[Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft]]; his appointment was considered a travesty and detrimental to educating theoretical physicists.&lt;ref name="Goudsmit, Samuel A. 1986 pp 117 -119"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beyerchen|1977|pp=153–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|1992|pp=383–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Powers|1993|pp=40–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|pp=152–7}} Document #55 ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sl69XGiohsoC&amp;pg=PA152 ’White Jews’ in Science &amp;#x5B;15 July 1937&amp;#x5D;]''&lt;br/&gt;pp. 175–6 Document #63 ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sl69XGiohsoC&amp;pg=PA175 Heinrich Himmler: Letter to Reinhard Heydrich &amp;#91;21 July 1938&amp;#93;]''&lt;br/&gt;pp. 176–7 Document #64 ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sl69XGiohsoC&amp;pg=PA176 Heinrich Himmler: Letter to Werner Heisenberg &amp;#91;21 July 1938&amp;#93;]''&lt;br/&gt;pp. 261–6 Document #85 ''Ludwig Prandtl: Attachment to the letter to Reich Marschal (sic) Hermann Göring [28 April 1941]'' &lt;br/&gt;pp. 290–2 Document #93 ''[[Carl Ramsauer]]: The Munich Conciliation and Pacification Attempt [20 January 1942]''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the SS investigation of Heisenberg, the three investigators had training in physics. Heisenberg had participated in the doctoral examination of one of them at the [[University of Leipzig|Universität Leipzig]]. The most influential of the three was [[Johannes Juilfs]]. During their investigation, they had become supporters of Heisenberg as well as his position against the ideological policies of the ''Deutsche Physik'' movement in theoretical physics and academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|1992|pp=390–1}} Please note that Cassidy uses the alias Mathias Jules for Johannes Juilfs.&lt;/ref&gt;

====German nuclear weapons program====
On 29 June 1936, a [[Nazi Party]] newspaper published a column attacking Heisenberg. On 15 July 1937, he was attacked in a journal of the SS.&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt; In mid-1936, Heisenberg presented his theory of [[cosmic ray|cosmic-ray]] showers in two papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heisenberg|1936 Forsch.

In June 1939, Heisenberg bought a summer home for his family in [[Urfeld am Walchensee]], in southern Germany. He also traveled to the United States in June and July, visiting [[Samuel Abraham Goudsmit]], at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]. However, Heisenberg refused an invitation to emigrate to the United States. He did not see Goudsmit again until six years later, when Goudsmit was the chief scientific advisor to the American [[Operation Alsos]] at the close of World War II.&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|pp=387, 387n20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goudsmit, ''Alsos'', 1986, picture facing p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[German nuclear weapons program]], known as ''Uranverein'', was formed on 1 September 1939, the day [[World War II]] began. The ''Heereswaffenamt'' (HWA, Army Ordnance Office) had squeezed the ''[[Reichsforschungsrat]]'' (RFR, Reich Research Council) out of the ''[[Reichserziehungsministerium]]'' (REM, Reich Ministry of Education) and started the formal German nuclear energy project under military auspices. The project had its first meeting on 16 September 1939. The meeting was organized by [[Kurt Diebner]], advisor to the HWA, and held in Berlin. The invitees included [[Walther Bothe]], [[Siegfried Flügge]], [[Hans Geiger]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Paul Harteck]], [[Gerhard Hoffmann]], [[Josef Mattauch]] and [[Georg Stetter]]. A second meeting was held soon thereafter and included Heisenberg, [[Klaus Clusius]], [[Robert Döpel]] and [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]. The ''Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik'' (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics) in [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Berlin-Dahlem]], was placed under HWA authority, with Diebner as the administrative director, and the military control of the nuclear research commenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Surviving the Swastika: Scientific Research in Nazi Germany|last = Macrakis|first = Kristie|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1993|isbn = 9780195070101|pages = 164-169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rechenberg, Volume 6 2001"&gt;Mehra and Rechenberg, Volume 6, Part 2, 2001, 1010–1011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|pp=363–4, Appendix F;}} see the entries for Diebner and Döpel.

At a scientific conference on 26-28 February 1942 at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, called by the Army Weapons Office, Heisenberg presented a lecture to Reichs officials on energy acquisition from nuclear fission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p14.htm American Institute for Physics, Center for History of Physics].&lt;/ref&gt; The lecture, entitled "Die theoretischen Grundlagen für die Energiegewinning aus der Uranspaltung" was, as Heisenberg confessed after the [[Second World War]] in a letter to [[Samuel Goudsmit]], "adapted to the intellectual level of a Reichs Minister".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Surviving the Swastika: Scientific Research in Nazi Germany|last = Macrakis|first = Kristie|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1993|isbn = 9780195070101|pages = 244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heisenberg lectured on the enormous energy potential of nuclear fission, stating that 250 million electron volts could be released through the fission of an atomic nucleus. Heisenberg stressed that pure U-235 had to be obtained to achieve a chain reaction. He explored various ways of obtaining isotope 235 U/92 in its pure from, including uranium enrichment and an alternative layered method of normal uranium and a moderator in a machine. This machine, he noted, could be used in practical ways to fuel vehicles, ships and submarines. Heisenberg stressed the importance of the Army Weapons Office's financial and material support for this scientific endevour. A second scientific conference followed. Lectures were heard on problems of modern physics with decisive importance for the national defense and economy. The conference was attended by [[Bernhard Rust]], the Reichs Minister of Science, Education and National Culture. At the conference Reichs Minister Rust decided to take the nuclear project away from the Kaiser Wilhelm Society. The Reichs Research Council was to take on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Surviving the Swastika: Scientific Research in Nazi Germany|last = Macrakis|first = Kristie|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1993|isbn = 9780195070101|pages = 171}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1942 the army returned the Physics Institute to the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, naming Heisenberg as Director at the Institute. With this appointment at the KWIP, Heisenberg obtained his first professorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Surviving the Swastika: Scientific Research in Nazi Germany|last = Macrakis|first = Kristie|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1993|isbn = 9780195070101|pages = 172}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Debye]] was still director of the institute, but had gone on leave to the United States after he had refused to become a German citizen when the HWA took administrative control of the KWIP. Heisenberg still also had his department of physics at the University of Leipzig where work had been done for the ''Uranverein'' by [[Robert Döpel]] and his wife [[Klara Döpel]].&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1993|pp=19, 94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 June 1942, Heisenberg was summoned to report to [[Albert Speer]], Germany's Minister of Armaments, on the prospects for converting the Uranverein's research toward developing [[nuclear weapon]]s. During the meeting, Heisenberg told Speer that a bomb could not be built before 1945, because it would require significant monetary resources and number of personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Speer, [[Inside the Third Reich]], Macmillan, 1970, pp. 225ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/~njenkins/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I662&amp;ged=auden-bicknell.ged Prof. Werner Carl Heisenberg  (I662)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615112426/http://www.stanford.edu/~njenkins/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I662&amp;ged=auden-bicknell.ged |date=15 June 2008 }}.

After the Uranverein project was placed under the leadership of the Reichs Research Council, it focused on [[nuclear power]] production and thus maintained its ''kriegswichtig'' (important for the war), funding therefore continued from the military. The [[nuclear power]] project was broken down into the following main areas: [[uranium]] and [[heavy water]] production, uranium [[isotope separation]] and the ''Uranmaschine'' (uranium machine, i.e., [[nuclear reactor]]). The project was then essentially split up between a number of institutes, where the directors dominated the research and set their own research agendas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Surviving the Swastika: Scientific Research in Nazi Germany|last = Macrakis|first = Kristie|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1993|isbn = 9780195070101|pages = 164-169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996}}; see the entry for the KWIP in Appendix A and the entries for the HWA and the RFR in Appendix B.

About 70 scientists worked for the program, with about 40 devoting more than half their time to nuclear fission research. After 1942, the number of scientists working on applied nuclear fission diminished dramatically. Many of the scientists not working with the main institutes stopped working on nuclear fission and devoted their efforts to more pressing war related work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1993|pp=52, Reference #40 on p. 262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1942, Heisenberg submitted his first paper of a three-part series on the scattering matrix, or [[S-matrix]], in elementary [[particle physics]]. The first two papers were published in 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heisenberg |first=W. |title=Die beobachtbaren Grössen in der Theorie der Elementarteilchen. I |journal=[[Z.

This was the same precedent as he followed in 1925 in what turned out to be the foundation of the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics through only the use of observables.&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name=MottPeierls77_231 /&gt;

In February 1943, Heisenberg was appointed to the Chair for Theoretical Physics at the ''Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität'' (today, the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin]]). In April, his election to the ''Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften'' ([[Prussian Academy of Sciences]]) was approved. That same month, he moved his family to their retreat in [[:de:Urfeld am Walchensee|Urfeld]] as Allied bombing increased in Berlin. In the summer, he dispatched the first of his staff at the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik'' to [[Hechingen]] and its neighboring town of [[Haigerloch]], on the edge of the [[Black Forest]], for the same reasons. From 18–26 October, he travelled to [[German-occupied Netherlands]]. In December 1943, Heisenberg visited [[History of Poland (1939–1945)|German-occupied Poland]].&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|2004|pp=300–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 24 January to 4 February 1944, Heisenberg travelled to occupied Copenhagen, after the German army confiscated [[Bohr's Institute of Theoretical Physics]]. He made a short return trip in April. In December, Heisenberg lectured in [[Switzerland during the World Wars#World War II|neutral Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt;  The United States [[Office of Strategic Services]] sent agent [[Moe Berg]] to attend the lecture carrying a pistol, with orders to shoot Heisenberg if his lecture indicated that Germany was close to completing an atomic bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/68/1/61.full|journal=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]|title=Nuclear scientists as assassination targets|author=William Tobey|doi=10.1177/0096340211433019|date=January–February 2012|volume=68|issue=1|pages=63–64}}, citing [[Thomas Powers]] 1993 book "Heisenberg's War".&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1945, Heisenberg, with most of the rest of his staff, moved from the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik'' to the facilities in the Black Forest.&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt;

====1945: Alsos Mission====
[[File:Haigerloch-nuclear-reactor ArM.JPG|thumb|right|Replica of the German experimental nuclear reactor captured and dismantled at Haigerloch.]]
{{main|Alsos Mission}}
The [[Alsos Mission]] was an Allied effort to determine if the Germans had an atomic bomb program and to exploit German atomic related facilities, research, materiel resources, and scientific personnel for the benefit of the US. Personnel on this operation generally swept into areas which had just come under control of the Allied military forces, but sometimes they operated in areas still under control by German forces.&lt;ref&gt;Goudsmit, Samuel with an introduction by [[Reginald Victor Jones|R. V. Jones]] ''Alsos'' (Toamsh, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Boris Pash|Pash, Boris T.]] ''The Alsos Mission'' (Award, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cassidy1992_491_5000&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|1992|pp=491–500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin had been a location of many German scientific research facilities. To limit casualties and loss of equipment, many of these facilities were dispersed to other locations in the latter years of the war. The ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik'' (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics) had been bombed so it had mostly been moved in 1943 and 1944 to [[Hechingen]] and its neighboring town of [[Haigerloch]], on the edge of the [[Black Forest]], which eventually became the French occupation zone. This allowed the American task force of the Alsos Mission to take into custody a large number of German scientists associated with nuclear research.&lt;ref&gt;Naimark, 1995, 208–209.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|2001|pp=49–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March, the Alsos Mission reached [[Heidelberg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Mahoney |first=Leo J. |title=A History of the War Department Scientific Intelligence Mission (ALSOS), 1943–1945 |degree=Ph.D. |publisher=Kent State University |year=1981 |oclc=223804966 |page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; where important scientists were captured including [[Walther Bothe]], [[Richard Kuhn]], [[Philipp Lenard]], and [[Wolfgang Gertner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goudsmit |first=Samuel A.|authorlink=Samuel Goudsmit  |title=Alsos |publisher=Henry Schuman |year=1947 |location=New York |isbn=0-938228-09-9 |oclc=8805725 |pages=77–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their interrogation revealed that [[Otto Hahn]] was at his laboratory in Tailfingen, while Heisenberg and [[Max von Laue]] were at Heisenberg's laboratory in Hechingen, and that the experimental natural uranium reactor that Heisenberg's team had built in Berlin had been moved to Haigerloch. Henceforth, the main focus of the Alsos Mission was on these nuclear facilities in the [[Württemberg]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Groves|first=Leslie |authorlink=Leslie Groves |title=Now it Can be Told: The Story of the Manhattan Project |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1962 |isbn=0-306-70738-1 |oclc=537684 |pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heisenberg was captured and arrested in Urfeld, on 3 May 1945, in an alpine operation in territory still under control by German forces. He was taken to Heidelberg, where, on 5 May, he met Goudsmit for the first time since the Ann Arbor visit in 1939. Germany surrendered just two days later. Heisenberg would not see his family again for eight months, as he was moved across France and Belgium and flown to England on 3 July 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassidy|1992|pp=491–510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|2001|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Boris Pash|Pash, Boris T.]] ''The Alsos Mission'' (Award, 1969) pp. 219–241.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1945: Reaction to Hiroshima====
Nine of the prominent German scientists who published reports in ''[[Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte]]'' as members of the ''Uranverein''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1993|pp=268–274, Reference #40 on p. 262}}&lt;/ref&gt; were captured by Operation Alsos and incarcerated in England under [[Operation Epsilon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|2001|pp=50, 363–365}}&lt;/ref&gt; 10 German scientists, including Heisenberg, were held at [[Farm Hall]] in England. The facility had been a [[safe house]] of the British foreign intelligence [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]. During their detention, their conversations were recorded. Conversations thought to be of intelligence value were transcribed and translated into English. The transcripts were released in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Franck ''Operation Epsilon: The Farm Hall Transcripts'' (University of California Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|2001|pp=xvii–xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 6th of August 1945 the scientists at Farm Hall learned from media reports that the USA had dropped an [[atomic bomb]] in [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]]. At first there was disbelief that a bomb had been built and dropped. In the weeks that followed, the German scientists discussed how the USA may have built the bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Surviving the Swastika: Scientific Research in Nazi Germany|last = Macrakis|first = Kristie|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1993|isbn = 9780195070101|pages = 143}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Farm Hall transcripts reveal that Heisenberg, along with other physicists interned at Farm Hall including [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], were glad the Allies had won World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernstein|first1=Jeremy|title=Hitler's Uranium Club|date=1996|publisher=AIP Press|location=Woodbury NY|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heisenberg told scientists that he had never contemplated a bomb, only an atomic pile to produce energy. The morality of creating a bomb for the Nazis was also discussed. Only a few of the scientists expressed genuine horror at the prospect of nuclear weapons, and Heisenberg himself was cautious in discussing the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transcript of Surreptitiously Taped Conversations among German Nuclear Physicists at Farm Hall (August 6–7, 1945)|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/pdf/eng/English101.pdf|publisher=German History in Documents and Images|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sartori|first1=Leo|title=Reviews|url=https://www.aps.org/units/fps/newsletters/2000/october/roct00.html|publisher=American Physical Society|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the failure of the German nuclear weapons program to build an atomic bomb, Heisenberg remarked: "We wouldn't have had the moral courage to recommend to the Government in the spring of 1942 that they should employ 120,000 men just for building the thing up."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Surviving the Swastika: Scientific Research in Nazi Germany|last = Macrakis|first = Kristie|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1993|isbn = 9780195070101|pages = 144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post 1945: Executive positions at research institutions====
[[File:Werner_Heisenberg_bust.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Heisenberg in his old age, on display at the [[Max Planck Society]] campus in [[Garching bei München]].]]
On 3 January 1946, the 10 [[Operation Epsilon]] detainees were transported to [[Alswede]] in Germany, which was in the British occupation zone. Heisenberg settled in Göttingen, also in the British zone. In July, he was named director of the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik'' (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics), then located in Göttingen. Shortly thereafter, it was renamed the [[Max Planck Institut für Physik]], in honor of [[Max Planck]] and to assuage political objections to the continuation of the institute.&lt;ref name="Hentschel 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt; 

In 1949, the ''Deutsche Forschungsrat'' (German Research Council) was established by the ''Max-Planck Gesellschaft'' (MPG, [[Max Planck Society]], successor organization to the ''[[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute|Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft]]''). Heisenberg was appointed president of the ''Deutsche Forschungsrat''. In 1951, the organization was fused with the [[Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft]] (NG, Emergency Association of German Science) and that same year renamed the ''Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft'' (DFG, German Research Foundation). With the merger, Heisenberg was appointed to the presidium.&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=Appendix A}}; see the entries for DFG and NG.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John L. Heilbron]] ''The Dilemmas of an Upright Man: Max Planck and the Fortunes of German Science'' (Harvard, 2000) pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Heisenberg served as the chairman of the Commission for Atomic Physics of the DFG. Also that year, he headed the German delegation to the European Council for Nuclear Research ([[CERN]]).&lt;ref name="Werner Heisenberg Biography" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt;
In 1953, Heisenberg was appointed president of the ''[[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation|Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung]]'' by [[Konrad Adenauer]]. Heisenberg served until 1975. Also, from 1953, Heisenberg's theoretical work concentrated on the [[unified field theory]] of [[elementary particles]].&lt;ref name="Werner Heisenberg Biography" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hentschel 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt;

In 1958 the Max-Planck-Institut für Physik was moved to Munich, expanded, and renamed Max-Planck-Institut für Physik und Astrophysik (MPIFA).  In the interim, Heisenberg and the astrophysicist [[Ludwig Biermann]] were co-directors of MPIFA. Heisenberg also became an ''ordentlicher Professor'' (ordinarius professor) at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München]]. Heisenberg was the sole director of MPIFA from 1960 to 1970. Heisenberg resigned his directorship of the MPIFA on 31 December 1970.&lt;ref name="Hentschel 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassidy, 1992" /&gt;

====Post 1945: Research interests====
In 1946 the German scientist [[Heinz Pose]], head of Laboratory V in [[Obninsk]], wrote a letter to Heisenberg inviting him to work in the USSR. The letter lauded the working conditions in the USSR and the available resources, as well as the favorable attitude of the Soviets towards German scientists. A courier hand delivered the recruitment letter, dated 18 July 1946, to Heisenberg; Heisenberg politely declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1993|pp=184–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oleynikov|2000|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Heisenberg presented lectures in [[Cambridge]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Bristol]]. Heisenberg contributed to the understanding of the phenomenon of [[superconductivity]] with a paper in 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heisenberg |first=W. |title=Zur Theorie der Supraleitung |journal=Forsch.

In the period shortly after World War II, Heisenberg briefly returned to the subject of his doctoral thesis, turbulence. Three papers were published in 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heisenberg |first=W. |title=Zur statistischen Theorie der Tubulenz |journal=Z.

In late 1955 to early 1956, Heisenberg gave the [[Gifford Lectures]] at [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews University]], in Scotland, on the [[intellectual history]] of physics. The lectures were later published as ''Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science''.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, ''Uncertainty'', 1992, 262.&lt;/ref&gt; During 1956 and 1957, Heisenberg was the chairman of the ''Arbeitskreis Kernphysik'' (Nuclear Physics Working Group) of the ''Fachkommission II "Forschung und Nachwuchs"'' (Commission II "Research and Growth") of the ''Deutschen Atomkommission'' (DAtK, German Atomic Energy Commission). Other members of the Nuclear Physics Working Group in both 1956 and 1957 were: [[Walther Bothe]], [[Hans Kopfermann]] (vice-chairman), [[Fritz Bopp]], [[Wolfgang Gentner]], [[Otto Haxel]], [[Willibald Jentschke]], [[Heinz Maier-Leibnitz]], [[Josef Mattauch]], Wolfgang Riezler, [[Wilhelm Walcher]] and [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]. [[Wolfgang Paul]] was also a member of the group during 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Horst Kant ''Werner Heisenberg and the German Uranium Project / Otto Hahn and the Declarations of Mainau and Göttingen'', Preprint 203 (Max-Planck Institut für Wissenschaftsgeschichte, [http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Preprints/P203.PDF 2002]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Heisenberg was a signatory of the ''Declaration of the German Nuclear Physicists'' of the ''[[Göttinger Manifest|Göttinger Achtzehn]]'' (Göttingen Eighteen).&lt;ref&gt;''Declaration of the German Nuclear Physicists'' [http://www.armscontrol.de/dokumente/goettingen-eng.pdf ArmsControl.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318084241/http://www.armscontrol.de/dokumente/goettingen-eng.pdf |date=18 March 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1957, Heisenberg was interested in [[plasma physics]] and the process of [[nuclear fusion]]. He also collaborated with the International Institute of Atomic Physics in [[Geneva]]. He was a member of the Institute's Scientific Policy Committee, and for several years was the Committee's chairman.&lt;ref name="Werner Heisenberg Biography" /&gt; He was one of the eight signatories of the [[Memorandum of Tübingen]] which called for the recognition of the [[Oder-Neiße line]] as the official border between [[Germany]] and [[Poland]] and spoke against a possible nuclear armament of [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name="Donhoff" &gt;{{cite news |first=Marion |last=Dönhoff |author-link=Marion Dönhoff |date=2 March 1962|title=Lobbyisten der Vernunft|trans-title=Lobbyists of reason|url=https://www.zeit.de/1962/09/lobbyisten-der-vernunft/komplettansicht|language=German |work=[[Die Zeit]]|location= |access-date=17 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Memorandum" &gt;{{cite news |date=2 March 1962|title=Das Memorandum der Acht|trans-title=The Memorandum of the eight|url=https://www.zeit.de/1962/09/das-memorandum-der-acht/komplettansicht|language=German |work=[[Die Zeit]]|location= |access-date=17 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1973, Heisenberg gave a lecture at [[Harvard University]] on the historical development of the concepts of quantum theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heisenberg |first=Werner |title=Development of concepts in the history of quantum theory |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=389–394 |year=1975 |bibcode=1975AmJPh..43..389H |doi=10.1119/1.9833 }} The substance of this article was presented by Heisenberg in a lecture at Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March 1973, Heisenberg gave a speech before the Catholic Academy of Bavaria, accepting the [[Romano Guardini]] Prize. An English translation of its title is "Scientific and Religious Truth". Its stated goal was "In what follows, then, we shall first of all deal with the unassailability and value of scientific truth, and then with the much wider field of religion, of which – so far as the Christian religion is concerned – Guardini himself has so persuasively written; finally – and this will be the hardest part to formulate – we shall speak of the relationship of the two truths."&lt;ref name=atf74&gt;Chapter 16 "Scientific and Religious Truth" in ''Across the Frontiers'', 1974, [[Harper &amp; Row]], pp. 213–229&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
In January 1937 Heisenberg met Elisabeth Schumacher (1914–1998) at a private music recital. Elisabeth was the daughter of a well-known Berlin economics professor, and her brother was the economist [[E. F. Schumacher]], author of ''[[Small Is Beautiful]]''. Heisenberg married her on 29 April. Fraternal twins Maria and Wolfgang were born in January 1938, whereupon [[Wolfgang Pauli]] congratulated Heisenberg on his "pair creation"&amp;nbsp;– a word play on a process from elementary particle physics, [[pair production]]. They had five more children over the next 12 years: Barbara, Christine, [[Jochen Heisenberg|Jochen]], [[Martin Heisenberg|Martin]] and Verena. Martin became a [[neurobiologist]] at the [[University of Würzburg]] and Jochen a physics professor at the [[University of New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, ''Uncertainty'', 1992, 372 and Appendix A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Cassidy and the American Institute of Physics, ''[http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p10.htm The Difficult Years]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Heisenberg enjoyed [[classical music]] and was an accomplished pianist.&lt;ref name="Werner Heisenberg Biography" /&gt;

Heisenberg was raised and lived as a [[Lutheran]] Christian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/people/ph/Werner_Heisenberg.html The religion of Werner Heisenberg, physicist]. Adherents.com. Retrieved on 1 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; His autobiography starts with the young Heisenberg in his late teenage years, reading Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' while hiking in the Bavarian Alps. Heisenberg recounted the philosophical conversations with his fellow students and teachers on understanding the [[atom]] while receiving his scientific training in Munich, Göttingen and Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Heisenberg in the Atomic Age: Science and the Public Sphere|last = Carson|first = Cathryn|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1910|isbn = 9780521821704|pages = 149}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his speech Scientific and Religious Truth (1974) while accepting the [[Romano Guardini]] Prize, Heisenberg affirmed:

{{quote|In the history of science, ever since the famous [[Galileo affair|trial of Galileo]], it has repeatedly been claimed that scientific truth cannot be reconciled with the religious interpretation of the world. Although I am now convinced that scientific truth is unassailable in its own field, I have never found it possible to dismiss the content of religious thinking as simply part of an outmoded phase in the consciousness of mankind, a part we shall have to give up from now on. Thus in the course of my life I have repeatedly been compelled to ponder on the relationship of these two regions of thought, for I have never been able to doubt the reality of that to which they point.|Heisenberg 1974, 213&lt;ref&gt;- Heisenberg, Werner. 1970.

Texte für den Religionsunterricht 4.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Where no guiding ideals are left to point the way, the scale of values disappears and with it the meaning of our deeds and sufferings, and at the end can lie only negation and despair. Religion is therefore the foundation of ethics, and ethics the presupposition of life.|Heisenberg 1974, 219&lt;ref&gt;Heisenberg, Werner. 1973. "Naturwissenschaftliche und religiöse Wahrheit". ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 24 March, pp. 7–8. (Speech before the Catholic Academy of Bavaria, on acceptance of the Guardini Prize, 23 March 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his late-sixties Heisenberg penned his autobiography for the mass market. In 1969 the book was published in Germany, in early 1971 it was published in English and in the years thereafter in a string of other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Heisenberg in the Atomic Age: Science and the Public Sphere|last = Carson|first = Cathryn|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1910|isbn = 9780521821704|pages = 145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heisenberg had initiated the project in 1966, when his public lectures increasingly turned to the subjects of philosophy and religion. Heisenberg had sent the publishers Hirzel and [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] the manuscript for a textbook on the [[unified field theory]]. This manuscript, he wrote to one of his publishers, was the preparatory work for his autobiography. He structured his autobiography in themes, covering: 1) The goal of exact science, 2) The problematic of language in atomic physics, 3) Abstraction in mathematics and science, 4) The divisibility of matter or Kant's antimony, 5) The basic symmetry and its substantiation, and 6) Science and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Heisenberg in the Atomic Age: Science and the Public Sphere|last = Carson|first = Cathryn|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1910|isbn = 9780521821704|pages = 147}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Heisenberg wrote his memoirs as a chain of conversations, covering the course of his life. The book became a popular success, but was regarded as troublesome by historians of science. In the preface Heisenberg wrote that he had abridged historical events, to make them more concise. At the time of publication it was reviewed by [[Paul Forman]] in the journal ''Science'' with the comment "Now here is a memoir in the form of rationally reconstructed dialogue. And the dialogue as Galileo well knew, is itself a most insidious literary device: lively, entertaining, and especially suited for insinuating opinions while yet evading responsibility for them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Heisenberg in the Atomic Age: Science and the Public Sphere|last = Carson|first = Cathryn|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1910|isbn = 9780521821704|pages = 145-146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few scientific memoirs had been published, but [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Adolf Portmann]] had penned popular books that conveyed scholarship to a wide audience. Heisenberg worked on his autobiography with the publisher [[Piper Verlag|Piper]] in Munich and initially proposed the title ''Gespräche im Umkreis der Atomphysik'' (''Conversations around atomic physics''). He settled with his publisher on ''Der Teil und das Ganze'' (''The part and the whole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Heisenberg in the Atomic Age: Science and the Public Sphere|last = Carson|first = Cathryn|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1910|isbn = 9780521821704|pages = 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heisenberg died of cancer of the kidneys and gall bladder at his home, on 1 February 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, ''Uncertainty'', 1992, 262, 545.&lt;/ref&gt; The next evening, his colleagues and friends walked in remembrance from the Institute of Physics to his home and each put a candle near the front door.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, ''Uncertainty'', 1992, 545.&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried at [[Munich Waldfriedhof]].

==''Research Reports in Nuclear Physics''==
The following reports were published in ''[[Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte]]'' (''Research Reports in Nuclear Physics''), an internal publication of the German ''[[German nuclear energy project|Uranverein]]''. The reports were classified [[Top Secret]], they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied [[Operation Alsos]] and sent to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] for evaluation. In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the [[Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center]] and the [[American Institute of Physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=Appendix E}}; see the entry for ''Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1993|pp=268–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wissenschaft''''' is the [[German language]] term for any study that involves systematic research.  The term is sometimes roughly translated as ''science'', although Wissenschaft is much broader and includes every systematic [[Discipline (academia)|academic study]] of any area, for example, [[humanities]] like [[art]] or [[religion]].&lt;ref name="Hansson"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/pseudo-science/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Hansson|first=Sven Ove|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Wissenschaft'' incorporates scientific and non-scientific inquiry, learning, knowledge, scholarship and implies that knowledge is a dynamic process discoverable for oneself, rather than something that is handed down. It did not necessarily imply [[empirical research]].

''Wissenschaft'' was the official ideology of German universities during the 19th century, and it led to the development of the modern [[research university]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/models-and-stereotypes/germanophilia-and-germanophobia/bas-van-bommel-between-bildung-and-wissenschaft-the-19th-century-german-ideal-of-scientific-education|title=Between 'Bildung' and 'Wissenschaft': The 19th-Century German Ideal of Scientific Education German Education and Science|last=Bommel|first=Bas van|date=2015-12-14|work=Europäische Geschichte Online|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasized the [[Humboldtian model of higher education|unity of teaching and individual research or discovery]] by the student, the &lt;span dir="ltr" lang="de"&gt;''Einheit von Lehre und Forschung''&lt;/span&gt;. It suggests that education is a process of growing and becoming.

Some 19th-century Americans visiting German universities interpreted Wissenschaft as meaning "pure science," untainted by social purposes and opposed to the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Veysay, Laurence R. The Emergency of the American University. Chicago: U Chicago P, 1965. Print. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary scientists and philosophers interpret ''Wissenschaft'' as meaning any true knowledge or successful method, including philosophical, mathematical, and logical knowledge and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/our-narrow-definition-of-science|title = Our Narrow Definition of "Science"|website = www.samharris.org|access-date = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Before [[Immanuel Kant]] published his ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, the "''&lt;span dir="ltr" lang="de"&gt;schöne Wissenshaft&lt;/span&gt;''" (roughly, "fine sciences") were highly regarded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The  "''&lt;span dir="ltr" lang="de"&gt;schöne Wissenshaft&lt;/span&gt;''" included [[poetry]], [[rhetoric]], and other subjects that were meant to promote an understanding of [[truth]], [[beauty]], and [[Good|goodness]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kant argued persuasively that [[Aesthetic taste|aesthetic judgments]] were not an area of systematic knowledge, and therefore were outside the realm of Wissenschaft.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Compared to science ==
Although ''Wissenschaft'' and ''science'' were roughly comparable words in previously centuries, the word ''science'' in English "has narrowed its meaning incomparably, whereas Wissenschaft...has retained its broad meaning".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Sundholm|first=Göran|title=The Vocabulary of Epistemology, with Observations on Some Surprising Shortcomings of the English Language|date=2014|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-05146-8_13|work=Mind, Values, and Metaphysics|pages=203–208|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-05146-8_13|isbn=9783319051451|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In modern English, the word ''science'' refers to systematically acquired, objective knowledge that is about a particular subject (the [[Natural science|workings of the natural world]], including [[Social science|the people in it]]) and produced through a particular methodology (the [[scientific method]]), in a progressive, iterative process that builds on previous knowledge.  Wissenschaft, by contrast, encompasses knowledge of objects as well as truths, such as what it means to be good.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The difficulties of being precise about knowledge are one reason why English is not considered well-suited for discussions about [[epistemology]], and terms from other languages, notably Latin and German, are commonly used.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== See also ==
Phrases employing this term include the following:
*''[[Wissenschaft des Judentums]]'', the "science of Judaism," a 19th-century scholarly movement.
*''[[The Gay Science|Die fröhliche Wissenschaft]]'', the title of a book written by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and first published in 1882.
