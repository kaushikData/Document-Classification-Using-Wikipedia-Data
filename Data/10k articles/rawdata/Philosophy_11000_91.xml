&lt;!-- note this article is focused on usage of the phrase, not on its mathematical incorrectness --&gt;
The phrase "'''two plus two equals five'''" ("'''2 + 2 = 5'''") is a slogan used in many different forms of [[Mass media|media]], most notably in Part One, Chapter Seven of the book ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'' by [[George Orwell]]. In the novel, it is used as an example of an obviously false [[dogma]] that one may be required to believe, similar to other obviously false slogans promoted by [[The Party (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|the Party]] in the novel.

Orwell's [[protagonist]], [[Winston Smith]], uses the phrase to wonder if [[Inner Party|the State]] might declare "two plus two equals five" as a fact; he ponders whether, if everybody believes it, that [[Consensus reality|makes it true]]. The [[Inner Party]] interrogator of [[thoughtcrime|thought-criminals]], [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]], says of the mathematically false statement that control over physical reality is unimportant; so long as one controls one's own perceptions to what the Party wills, then any corporeal act is possible, in accordance with the principles of [[doublethink]] ("Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once").&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', Part Three, Chapter Two&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-evident truth and self-evident falsehood==
The equation 2 + 2 = 4 has been proverbial as the type of an obvious truth since the 16th century, and it appears as such in [[Johann Wigand]]'s 1562 ''De Neutralibus et Mediis Libellus'': "That twice two are four, a man may not lawfully make a doubt of it, because that manner of knowledge is grauen [graven] into mannes [man's] nature."&lt;ref name="Clarendon Press"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=F. P. |year=1970 |title=The Oxford Dictionary of English Proverbs |edition=3rd |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |page=849 |isbn=0198691181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[René Descartes]]' realm of pure ideas considers that self-evident idea such as two plus two equals four may, in fact, have no reality outside the mind. According to the [[Meditations on First Philosophy|First Meditation]] (1641), the standard of truth is self-evidence of clear and distinct ideas. However, Descartes questions the correspondence of these ideas to reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wright.edu/cola/descartes/meditation1.html |title=Descartes' Meditations Home Page |publisher=Wright.edu |date=27 July 2005 |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his play ''[[Dom Juan]]'' (1682), [[Molière]]'s title character is asked what he believes. He answers that he believes that two plus two equals four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moliere-in-english.com/donjuan.html |title=Moliere Don Juan Adapted by Timothy Mooney |publisher=Moliere-in-english.com |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mirror-image of this—that 2 + 2 = 5 is the archetypical untruth—is attested at least as early as 1728.  [[Ephraim Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'', published in that year, follows its definition of the word ''absurd'' with this illustrative example: "Thus, a proposition would be absurd, that should affirm, that two and two make five; or that should deny 'em to make four."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chambers |first1=Ephraim |year=1728 |title=Cyclopaedia; or, an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences...Volume the First |url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Cyclopaedia%2C_Chambers_-_Volume_1.djvu/page56-2096px-Cyclopaedia%2C_Chambers_-_Volume_1.djvu.jpg |location=London |publisher=James and John Knapton ''et al.'' |page=11 |access-date=25 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly [[Samuel Johnson]] said in 1779 that "You may have a reason why two and two should make five, but they will still make but four."&lt;ref name="Clarendon Press"/&gt;

The first known sympathetic reference to the equation 2 + 2 = 5 appears in an 1813 letter by [[Lord Byron]] to his soon-to-be wife [[Anne Isabella Byron, Baroness Byron|Anabella Milbanke]] in which he writes, "I know that two and two make four—&amp; should be glad to prove it too if I could—though I must say if by any sort of process I could convert 2 &amp; 2 into'' five ''it would give me much greater pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alas! the Love of Women: 1813–1814|authorlink=Lord Byron|last=Byron|first=George Gordon|year=1974|editor=Leslie A.

==French and Russian literature==
[[File:Allais - Deux et deux font cinq (2+2=5).djvu|page=7|thumb|An 1895 collection of short stories by French writer [[Alphonse Allais]] was published under the title ''2 + 2 = 5'']]
Although the phrase "2 + 2 = 5" had earlier been used to indicate an absurdity in general, its use within a political setting is first attested at the dawning of the [[French Revolution]].  [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Abbé Sieyès]], in his ''[[What Is the Third Estate?]]'' (1789), mocked the fact that the [[Estates General (France)|Estates-General]] gave disproportionate voting power to the aristocracy and the clergy in with the following analogy: "Consequently if it be claimed that under the French constitution, 200,000 individuals out of 26 million citizens constitute two-thirds of the common will, only one comment is possible: it is a claim that two and two make five."&lt;ref name="BakerBoyer1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Keith M. Baker|author2=John W. Boyer|author3=Julius Kirshner|title=University of Chicago Readings in Western Civilization, Volume 7: The Old Regime and the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z5MelCA-zzIC&amp;pg=PA154|date=15 May 1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-06950-0|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Honoré de Balzac]]'s novel ''[[Séraphîta]]'' (1834) contains the following passage:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1432?msg=welcome_stranger|title=Seraphita by Honoré de Balzac}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Thus, you will never find in all nature two identical objects; in the natural order, therefore, two and two can never make four, for, to attain that result, we must combine units that are exactly alike, and you know that it is impossible to find two leaves alike on the same tree, or two identical individuals in the same species of tree.

That axiom of your numeration, false in visible nature, is false likewise in the invisible universe of your abstractions, where the same variety is found in your ideas, which are the objects of the visible world extended by their interrelations; indeed, the differences are more striking there than elsewhere.}}

[[Victor Hugo]] used this phrase in 1852. He objected to the way in which the vast majority of French voters had backed [[Napoleon III]], endorsing the way liberal values had been ignored in Napoleon III's coup.&lt;ref name="Roderick T. Long"&gt;{{cite web|last=Long|first=Roderick T.|title=Victor Hugo on the Limits of Democracy|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/long/long12.html|accessdate=5 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115115619/http://www.lewrockwell.com/long/long12.html|archivedate=15 January 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1852 pamphlet, ''[[Napoléon le Petit]]'', he writes: "Now, get seven million five hundred thousand votes to declare that two and two make five, that the straight line is the longest road, that the whole is less than its part; get it declared by eight millions, by ten millions, by a hundred millions of votes, you will not have advanced a step."

Russian writer [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] is known to be influenced by Hugo and his ''Napoléon le Petit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6famAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA470|title=Классическая традиция. Собрание трудов по истории русской литературы|last=Пумпянский|first=Лев|date=2017-09-05|publisher=Litres|year=|isbn=9785457489134|location=|pages=|language=ru|quote=Влияние... «Наполеона малого» на стиль и тембр памфлетов Достоевского весьма существенно}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Dostoyevsky's ''[[Notes from Underground]]'' (published in 1864), the protagonist implicitly supports the idea of two times two making five, spending several paragraphs considering the implications of rejecting the statement "two times two makes four".  His purpose is not ideological, however. Instead, he proposes that it is the free will to choose or reject the logical as well as the illogical that makes mankind human. He adds: "I admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing, but if we are to give everything its due, twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicreader.com/book/414/10/|title=Notes from the Underground: Part I: Chapter IX by Fyodor Dostoevsky|website=Classic Reader|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea seems to have been significant to [[Russian literature]] and culture. [[Ivan Turgenev]] wrote in ''Prayer'' (1881), one of his ''Poems in Prose'' "Whatever a man prays for, he prays for a miracle. Every prayer reduces itself to this: Great God, grant that twice two be not four." Also similar sentiments are said to be among [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s last words when urged to convert back to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]: "Even in the valley of the shadow of death, two and two do not make six." Even turn-of-the-century Russian newspaper columnists used the phrase to suggest the moral confusion of the age.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Novoe vremia'' newspaper ("New Times"), 31 October 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] in ''[[God and the State]]'' (1882), classifies [[Deism]] as: "Imagine a philosophical vinegar sauce of the most opposed systems, a mixture of [[Church Fathers|Fathers of the Church]], scholastic philosophers, [[Descartes]] and [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and Scottish psychologists, all this a superstructure on the divine and innate ideas of [[Plato]], and covered up with a layer of [[Hegelian]] immanence accompanied, of course, by an ignorance, as contemptuous as it is complete, of natural science, and proving just as two times two make five; the existence of a [[personal God]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Communist Manifesto and Other Revolutionary Writings |publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|year=2003|isbn=0486424650|page=199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bT1gfI3jjkC&amp;pg=PA199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Reaction In Germany'' (1842) Bakunin compares the behavior of Compromising Positivists to the one of [[Juste-milieu]] at the beginning of the [[July Revolution]] quoting a French journal: "The Left says, 2 times 2 are 4; the Right, 2 times 2 are 6; and the Juste-milieu says, 2 times 2 are 5".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakunin|first1=Mikhail Aleksandrovich|title=Selected writings|publisher=Grove Press : distributed by Random House|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jXpuAAAAIAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/al_Michail_Bakunin_The_Reaction_in_Germany_From_the_Notebooks_of_a_Frenchman_a4|title=The Reaction in Germany From the Notebooks of a Frenchman|publisher=The Anarchist Library|year=1842|first=Michail|last=Bakunin|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyers|first1=Jeffrey|title=Orwell: Life and Art|date=2010|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252090226|page=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eUQ1Z12trIEC&amp;pg=PA149|accessdate=13 June 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Deux et deux font cinq (2 + 2 = 5'') was the title of a short story collection by French [[Absurdist fiction|absurdist]] writer [[Alphonse Allais]] published in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Deux et deux font cinq (2 + 2 = 5)|last=Allais|first=Alphonse|date=1895|publisher=Ollendorff|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 1920 [[art manifesto]] by Russian [[Imaginism|imaginist]] poet [[Vadim Shershenevich]] was titled ''2 × 2 = 5''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=2 × 2 = 5: листы имажиниста|last=Шершеневич|first=Вадим|date=1920|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet planning==
[[File:Yakov Guminer - Arithmetic of a counter-plan poster (1931).jpg|thumb|"Arithmetic of an alternative plan: 2+2 plus the enthusiasm of the workers=5". Soviet propaganda poster by Iakov Guminer, 1931]]
The Soviet Union began its [[First five-year plan|first five-year economic plan]] in 1928. Its goals were ambitious from the start, seeking the immediate transformation of the USSR into an industrial nation. The consequences for underperformance during the plan were severe; managers who admitted missing their targets, even as those targets were revised upward, could be charged with the crime of '[[Wrecking (Soviet Union)|wrecking]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Krenz (2006) ''A History of the Soviet Union from the Beginning to the End''&lt;/ref&gt; After statistics from the first two years indicated that the plan was ahead of schedule, [[Joseph Stalin]] announced that the plan would be completed in four years.&lt;ref name='Stalin"1930"'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stalin|first1=Joseph|title=Political Report of the Central Committee to the Sixteenth Congress of the C.P.S.U.(B.)|date=June 1930|publisher=Pravda, No. 177|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1930/aug/27.htm|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Propagandist Iakov Guminer supported this campaign with a 1931 poster reading "Arithmetic of an alternative plan: 2+2 plus the enthusiasm of the workers=5". Stalin declared the plan a success at the beginning of 1933, noting the creation of several heavy industries.&lt;ref name='Stalin"1933"'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stalin|first1=Joseph|title=Joint Plenum of the C.C. and C.C.C., C.P.S.U.(B.)

==George Orwell==
George Orwell had used this concept before publishing ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' in 1949. During his career at the [[BBC]], he became familiar with the methods of [[Nazi propaganda]]. In his essay "Looking Back on the [[Spanish Civil War|Spanish War]]",&lt;ref name=lookingback&gt;{{cite web|title=Looking back on the Spanish War|authorlink=George Orwell|last=Orwell|first=George|publisher=orwell.ru|url=http://orwell.ru/library/essays/Spanish_War/english/esw_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1943 (six years before the publication of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''), Orwell wrote:

{{quote|Nazi theory indeed specifically denies that such a thing as "the truth" exists.&amp;nbsp;... The implied objective of this line of thought is a nightmare world in which the Leader, or some ruling clique, controls not only the future but ''the past''. If the Leader says of such and such an event, "It never happened"&amp;nbsp;– well, it never happened. If he says that two and two are five&amp;nbsp;– well, two and two are five. This prospect frightens me much more than bombs.&lt;ref name=lookingback/&gt;}}

In the view of most of Orwell's biographers,{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} the main source for this was ''Assignment in Utopia'' by [[Eugene Lyons]], an account of his time in the Soviet Union. This contains a chapter "Two Plus Two Equals Five",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXLhwVJvfXMC&amp;pg=PA240|title=Assignment in Utopia|last=Lyons|first=Eugene|date=1938|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=|isbn=9781412817608|location=|pages=240|language=en|chapter=XV. Two Plus Two Equals Five}}&lt;/ref&gt; that referred to Guminer's slogan.

However, Orwell spoke of the [[Nazism|Nazis]], so he may have been making reference to the [[Reichsmarschall]] [[Hermann Göring]], who once, in a debatably hyperbolic display of loyalty to [[Adolf Hitler]], declared, "If the Führer wants it, two and two makes five!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hermann Göring|work=Museum of Tolerance Multimedia Learning Center|url=http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/text/x18/xr1883.html|accessdate=18 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041227105306/http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/text/x18/xr1883.html|archivedate=27 December 2004|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', Orwell writes:

{{quote|In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the very existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right. For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four?  Or that the force of gravity works?  Or that the past is unchangeable?  If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable&amp;nbsp;– what then?&lt;ref&gt;[[George Orwell]].  ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.  [[Secker and Warburg]] (1949). {{ISBN|0-452-28423-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==After Orwell==

===In politics and religion===
In presidential debates prior to the [[2009 Iranian presidential elections]], reformist candidate [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]] accused his interlocutor, president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], of being illogical and said: "If you ask (the president) what two by two makes he would answer five." In the following days, one of the slogans chanted by Mousavi's supporters was "two by two makes five!"

Media critic [[Andrew Keen]] uses the phrase in his 2007 critique of Wikipedia's policy to let anyone edit. He believes, along with [[Marshall Poe]], that this leads to an encyclopedia of [[common knowledge]], not [[expert|expert knowledge]]. He believes the "[[wisdom of the crowd]]" will distort truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keen|first1=Andrew|title=[[The Cult of the Amateur]]|year=2007|publisher=Doubleday|pages=39–40, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Italian Catholic priest [[Antonio Spadaro]], a close associate of [[Pope Francis]], tweeted "Theology is not #Mathematics. 2 + 2 in #Theology can make 5. Because it has to do with #God and real #life of #people..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/antoniospadaro/status/817144723093733377?lang=en|title=Theology is not #Mathematics. 2 + 2 in #Theology can make 5.

Others have defended him, claiming that he was merely referring to the Catholic view that God will never be able to be perfectly comprehended by human reason alone. Others compared him humorously to Rex Mottram, a character in [[Evelyn Waugh|Evelyn Waugh's]] 1945 novel ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]''. In the novel, Mottram, during his [[catechesis]] as he disinterestedly prepares to enter the Catholic church to marry another main character, makes no effort to rationally ascertain any aspect of the faith, attributing all contradictions to his sinfulness.

In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Chain of Command (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Chain of Command, Part II]]" (1992), [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Picard]] is tortured by a [[Cardassian]] in a manner similar to the torture of [[Winston Smith]] by O'Brien from ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''. During the episode, the Cardassian officer tries to coerce Picard to admit seeing five lights when in fact there were only four. Picard valiantly sticks to reality. Near the end when Picard is about to be brought back to his crew, he defiantly declares, once again, "There!... Are!... ''Four!''... ''Lights!''" However, later in a counseling session with [[Deanna Troi|Troi]], Picard admits that he believed he ''did'' see five lights at the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|o_eSwq1ewsU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2009/05/there_are_four_lights.html|title=There Are Four Lights!|last=Lapidos|first=Juliet|date=2009-05-07|work=Slate|accessdate=2 October 2017|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Iranian short film [[Two &amp; Two (2011 film)|''Two &amp; Two'']] (2011), a teacher in an authoritarian school uses "2 + 2 = 5" as tool to instill conformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manhattanshort.com/finalists/two_and_two.html|title=Two &amp; Two. The Manhattan Short|website=www.manhattanshort.com|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the video game ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'', the character [[Ocelot (Metal Gear)|Ocelot]] will repeat "2 + 2 = 5", as one of a few phrases he says after telling the player he has received drug resistance training. This is a reference to Ocelot's own doublethink during the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=JARVIS|title=MGS5: Revolver Ocelot Tranquilizer Easter Egg|date=2015-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcQERtOvr5s|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the video game ''[[Orwell (video game)|Orwell]]'', the achievement '2+2=5' is unlocked for ensuring the public acceptance of the Orwell surveillance system and the eradication of Thought, a prominent anti-government movement, therefore ensuring the continued and total control of The Nation's totalitarian government.

Brazilian songwriter [[Caetano Veloso]] wrote a song called "Como 2+2" ("like 2+2", in Portuguese), in which one of the verses translates as "everything allright like 2 + 2 are 5", a reference to the dictatorship that ruled Brazil then.

Dostoevsky's dialogue about two times two equaling five is recited in the 2018 HBO movie ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (2018 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]''.

In business texts about [[synergy]], "2 + 2 = 5" is used without irony to indicate that the outcome of a collective effort is greater sum of individual efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/management/Str-Ti/Synergy.html|title=Synergy - organization, system, company, business, system, History of synergy, Individuals and synergy|website=www.referenceforbusiness.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A Scientific Support for Darwinism''' (''And For Public Schools Not To Teach "Intelligent Design" As Science'') was a four-day, [[word-of-mouth]] petition of scientists in support of [[evolution]]. Inspired by [[Project Steve]], it was initiated in 2005 by [[archaeologist]] [[R. Joe Brandon]] to produce a public response to the [[Discovery Institute]]'s 2001 petition ''[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism]]''.

The Discovery Institute's petition was publicized in 2005 by media coverage of the Discovery Institute's efforts to introduce "[[intelligent design]]" in science classrooms and the opposition to those efforts in the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] case. Brandon noticed that only about 80 of those appearing on the ''Dissent'' petition had expertise in an area relevant to evolution. Therefore, Brandon decided to create a petition of his own of scientists supporting evolution. The petition was hosted at ShovelBums.org, but has since been removed from the site.&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/science/22askscience.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5070&amp;en=fb91b414ead13f63&amp;ex=1188273600 |title=Ask Science |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 7,733 scientists signed a statement affirming their support for [[evolution]] over a 4-day period.

==Statement==
The statement was entitled ''A Scientific Support for Darwinism And For Public Schools Not To Teach "Intelligent Design" As Science'',&lt;ref&gt;The term [[Darwinism]] is not in common scientific use, and was employed to mirror the title of the [[Discovery Institute]]'s petition, "[[A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism]]". See [http://shovelbums.org/content/view/150/520/  The problem with using Darwinism in the title of this petition:  Scientific Support For Darwinism And For Public Schools Not To Teach Intelligent Design As Science and why I had to use it.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015707/http://shovelbums.org/content/view/150/520/ |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and read:

{{quotation|
This petition is in response to the Discovery Institute's petition "A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism" signed, since 2001, by 400 scientists, as of July 2005. That petition is presented to the public as a scientific endorsement of the religion-based concept of Intelligent Design over Darwinism (read more). Unfortunately, the majority, 83%, of these 'scientists' are not schooled in the fields that utilize evolutionary theory in detail, nor even in science, and they are not 
qualified to present their ideas in a way other than personal opinion. We feel this petition is misleading the public, and we use this petition to show that:

''Our Petition:''

"''We, as scientists trained in fields that utilize evolutionary theory, do not consider Intelligent Design to be a fact-based science appropriate for teaching in public schools because it is theistic in nature, not empirical, and therefore does not pass the rigors of scientific hypothesis testing and theory development. As such, we petition that Intelligent Design not be presented in public schools as a viable science within the scientific curriculum.''"

"This petition does not represent an atheistic or exclusionary scientific school of thought, and we do not endorse Intelligent Design, or other religious subjects, being prohibited from discussion in the appropriate classroom setting. Indeed many of us belong to religious denominations, and we respect and support individuals' rights to put evolution, the origins of the universe, and life, into a context that they understand as defined by their religion. Science, however, is not designed to explain or debunk religious concepts that are based in faith, and, as such, religion-based concepts should not be taught as science."}}

==Results==
[[File:Petitiontime.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A graph showing the number of signatures over four days (courtesy Mark Sidall)]]

In four days in the fall of 2005, starting on September 28, 2005 and ending at 4:09 pm [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Time]], October 1, 2005, the petition supporting "[[Darwinism]]" gathered 7,733 verified signatures from concerned scientists. Of these, 6,965 were [[United States|US]] residents and 4,066 had [[doctorate|PhDs]]. The "Four Day Petition" was carried out with no outside funding or assistance of any professional society. The effort was carried out by [[e-mail]] and [[word-of-mouth]].

Among the signatories were 21 U.S. [[National Academy of Science]] members, nine [[MacArthur Fellowship]] awardees, and a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate. According to Brandon's analysis, of those who signed his petition, there were

#3,385 with biology in their title
#850 with anthropology/archaeology
#680 with evolutionary &amp; ecology
#394 from the field of genetics
#270 from geology and related fields
#234 from the fields of physics, astronomy, or space sciences
#111 chemists
#110 psychologists
#75 computer scientists
#50 engineers

Therefore, about 68 percent of those signing the Brandon petition work in biology-related fields (using the first four categories from the list above).&lt;ref name=Chang/&gt;

This "Scientific Support" petition collected signatures at a rapid pace. The responses to the Brandon petition arrived at a rate 697,000% faster than the signatures collected on the Discovery Institute [[A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism|Darwin Dissent]] petition.&lt;ref name=press/&gt;

==History==
Brandon's original goal was to get 400 petition signatures in four hours. However, Brandon found he was 75 signatures short after four hours, and so he decided to extend his collection period to four days. The emails became more frequent, and at one point, petition responses were arriving every 3.5 seconds.&lt;ref name=Chang/&gt; However, the 325 signatures collected in the first four hours can be compared to the Discovery Institute's gathering of 400 signatures of self-identified scientists, most in irrelevant fields, in four years. In the week after the close of the four-day period, another several thousand signatures arrived, but were not included in the official tally.

One signatory, Dr. Steve Brill of [[Rutgers University]], stated,
{{quote|To be called a scientific theory, Intelligent Design must be at the very least, disprovable. Since there is no way for Intelligent Design to be disproved, it fails the simplest test of scientific theory.}}

In a press release on October 20, 2005 announcing the results of the "Four Day Petition", Brandon drew attention to the remarks of Discovery Institute Senior Fellow [[Michael Behe]]'s faculty colleagues in the biological sciences at [[Lehigh University]]. Twenty of Behe's peers remarked collectively that

{{quote|As Michael J. Behe's faculty colleagues... we lend our voices to the chorus of nearly all scientists who conclude that 'Intelligent Design' is not a scientific theory, but rather a loosely veiled attempt to explain natural phenomena by invoking the concept of a supernatural entity. Intelligent Design is not a scientific alternative to Darwinian evolution and has no place in the biology classroom.&lt;ref name=press&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/10-20-2005/0004173856&amp;EDATE= PRNewsWire ''Thousands of Scientists Sign Petition Opposing the Teaching of Intelligent Design as Science: No Debate Among Scientists - Regardless of Faith, Intelligent Design Is Not Science], official text of press release, [[PR Newswire]], [[Columbus, Ohio]], October 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another signatory, [[biology|biologist]] Mark Siddall of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] stated,
{{quote|This is not a fight about what the nature of science is. Scientists have already determined that. It's a fight about what our daughters and sons will be taught is the nature of science.}}

Siddall added "R. Joe's efforts elicited an overwhelming response from the scientific community—one that cut across lines of faith as deeply as it did across fields of scientific study." Siddall also assisted Brandon in checking that the IP addresses of the respondents corresponded to the institutions they claimed to be affiliated with.&lt;ref name=Chang/&gt;

Brandon's original plan was to compile the signatures that he obtained and pass them on to Judge [[John E. Jones III]] who was handling the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] case, as well as announce the results in a press release. The petition was not completed sufficiently early to submit it as part of an ''[[amicus curae]]'' brief for the [[Dover, Pennsylvania|Dover]] case. However, if the case was to go to the [[US Supreme Court]], the petition could have been submitted as an ''amicus'' brief at that time.

R. Joe Brandon emphasized that this "Four Day Petition" did not mean that scientific issues are settled by majority vote. What Brandon maintains is that this is an indication of the level of scientific consensus that accepts evolution as a viable established scientific theory that has passed a large number of hurdles and is [[evidence of evolution|supported by an immense amount of evidence]].

'''Al-Ḥakīm al-Tirmidhī''' ({{lang-ar|الحكيم الترمذي}}), full name Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī al-Ḥakīm al-Tirmidhī al-Ḥanafī (d. c. 869) was a Sunni jurist (''faqih'') and traditionist (''muhaddith'') of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], but is mostly remembered as one of the great early authors of [[Sufism]]. His full name is: Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Ali bin Hasan bin Bashir (in some sources it is 'Bishr') Al Hakim At-Termizi. He is locally known as At-[[Termiz]]i or [[Termiz]] Ota ("Father of Termiz city").

Information about his life and scientific and creative activities can be found in the works by Taj ad-Din Subki (Tabakat Ash-Shafii'yya Al-kubra), Khatiba Baghdad (Tarikh Baghdad), Ibn Hajara AshkAlani (Lisan Al-Miyzan), Sulami (Tabaqat As-Sufiyya) and in a number of other treatises.

Al Hakim At-Termizi speaks about his life in his book ''Bad'u Shaani Abu Abdullah'' ("The Beginning of Abu Abdullah's Pursuit"), published in [[Beirut]] in 1965 by Yakh'ya Ismail Usman, together with the work of the scientist in ''Khatm Al-Avliya'' ("Seal of the Saints").
{{Sufism|Notable early}}

==Life==
Tirmidhi was apparently born between 820 and 830 AD in [[Termez]], Khorasan, nowadays Uzbekistan. His father was a scholar of [[hadith]] and a jurist; his early education appears to have been very orthodox. He was reared as a scholar of ''hadith'' and ''fiqh'' (law), more specifically, the [[Hanafi]] school of law that was dominant in eastern territories of Iran. The range of Tirmidhi's education did include the sciences, such as Greek natural science and philosophy. His subsequent reference to learning the use of the astrolabe, implying a knowledge of astronomy and mathematics, has been given different interpretations. "There is no trace of influence from 'natural science' in his writings." But being a Sufi Master is enough to accept that he did. However, his general pursuit of knowledge gained him the name of "''al-hakim''" (the title which means he had mastered the five sciences-Mathematics-Logic-Music-Medicine and Astronomy).

== Early years ==
Different dates are used in written sources and present literature to indicate Al Hakim At-Termizi's date of birth and death. Some authors, Khwaja Khalif in particular, in his ''Kashf as-Zunun'', give the year 255 in Hijra / 869 AD as Al Hakim At-Termizi's date of death. The same date was written on Al Hakim At-Termizi's tomb. If we proceed from the fact that Al Hakim At-Termizi lived more than one hundred years, some sources say 112, 116 or 120 years, he was born approximately between 750–760 AD. At the same time, Abdulfattah Abdullah Baraka who wrote his great "Al Hakim At-Termizi and Nazariyyatukhu fil" ("Al Hakim At-Termizi and his theory") thirty years ago, said that Al Hakim At-Termizi, was born in 205 in Hijri / 820 and died in 320 in Hijri / 932 and lived 112 years.

Detailed information about Al Hakim At-Termizi's childhood and youth is not available in the sources. According to his "autobiography", he started learning religious sciences when he was eight, and he made a [[Hajj]] to [[Mecca]] when he was twenty-eight.

== Later life ==
Returning from Mecca, Al Hakim At-Termizi became a [[Sufi]] follower; he withdrew from people and learned treaties.
His father Ali bin Hassan was a leading scholar, a [[Hadith]] specialist, who, looking for knowledge, went to [[Baghdad]] and took an active part in scientific discussions with prominent scholars of the time on various problems of Hadith. His mother and uncle were considered to be experts of [[Hadith]]. Consequently, Al Hakim At-Termizi grew up in the circle of educated and scientific people, which influenced greatly on his ideology.

Some written sources contain reliable information about Al Hakim At-Termizi's teachers. His teacher was his father Ali bin Al-Hassan at Termizi "History of Baghdad" by Khatib Al-Bagdhadi contains some information. Among his other teachers were Kutaiba bin Sayid as-Sakafi Al- Balkhi (798–888 AD), Salih bin Abdullah At-Termizi of much interesting facts had been written in the book "Books about Famous People" by Ibn Khibbana; Salih bin Muhammad At-Termizi who was former qazi of Termiz for some time, Sufyan bin Vaki (died in 860), Hassan bin Umar bin Shafiq Al- Balkhi (died in 840 AD), Ahmad bin Khadravayh (died in 854 AD), Abu Turab An-Nakhshabi (link), and Yahya bin Maaz Ar-Razi (died in 875 AD).

Based on data given in the written sources Al Hakim At-Termizi's life can be divided into the following periods:

*The first period includes Al Hakim At-Termizi's childhood up to seven. Unfortunately we do not have exact information about this part of his life. But nevertheless, one can say that unlike the children of his age he displayed ability at this age to various games, as if he prepared himself to the future scientific life, he worked hard with his teachers, obtained knowledge on various sciences (particularly on theology) and got ready to mystic spiritual life.
*The second period embraces Al Hakim At-Termizi's life from eight to twenty eight, when he received knowledge from different teachers ([[sheikhs]]). For knowledge he visited other oriental cities, was in Mecca and made a pilgrimage. Some sources pointed to the fact that he paid much attention to learning [[Hadith]] and problems of [[fiqh]] in this period of his life.
*The third period of his life is related to learning the [[Qur'an]] thoroughly. He assimilated by deep God's words, their essence, fasting, praying and pious deeds and so on. The philosophic [[Mysticism|mystic]] work by Al-Antahi "Healing of Hearts" had a great influence on him.

Al Hakim At-Termizi had many of students, including: Abu Muhammad Yahya bin Mansur Al-Kadi (died in 960 AD), Abu Ali Mansur bin Abdullah bin Khalid Al-Zuhli Al Hiravi; Abu Ali Al-Hassan bin Ali Al-Jurjani. He also taught Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Isa, Abu Bakr Muhammad Ibn Umar Al-Al Hakim Al-Varrak, Muhammad bin Jaafar bin Muhammad bin Al-Haisam bin Umran bin Buraida, and others.

Al Hakim At-Termizi's scientific and creative activity is closely connected with his travels to other countries and cities. He visited [[Balkh]], [[Nishapur]], and [[Baghdad]], where science and culture reached its zenith, and he met famous scholars and took part in discussions. Nevertheless, [[Termiz]], his native city played an important role in his scientific and creative activity, and there he created his basic works. His sermons and as well as some works, first of all, ''Hatam Al-Avliya'' (Seal of Saints), ''Hal Ash-Shari'a'' (Arguments of the Islamic Law) in which are discussed [[Muslim]] rituals, about "love for God" and about various categories of mystics, about "the Seals of Saints", along with existing "Seals of Prophets", had dissatisfied some parts of the [[falikh]] and rich. Escaping from his enemies' chase, Al Hakim At-Termizi had to move to [[Balkh]] and then to [[Nishapur]], where he was very well accepted and where he obtained a large number of followers later.

==Works==
According to Radtke and O'Kane, "he is the first and, up until the time of Ibn al-Arabi, the only mystic author whose writings present a broad synthesis of mystic experience, anthropology, cosmology and Islamic theology... Tirmidhi's system of thought is representative of an old Islamic theosophy which had not yet consciously assimilated elements from the Aristotelian-Neoplatonic philosophic tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Radtke and O'Kane, ''The Concept of Sainthood in Early Islamic Mysticism'' (Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Bayan al-farq bayn al-ṣadr wa-al-qalb wa-al-fu'ād wa-al-lubb'' [http://rissc.jo/docs/04-bayan/120102-bayanalFarqweb.pdf Recent online Arabic edition]

Different figures on the number of Al Hakim At-Termizi's works are mentioned in the written sources. Some authors say that the number of his work reaches four hundred. But the majority of authors tend to think that about eighty works belong to him. The famous Egyptian scholar Abdelfattah Abdulla Baraka writes that out of four hundred works by Al Hakim At-Termizi only about sixty have reached us. Though many works were lost, the most important ones that contain the great scholar's basic teachings, which comprise his scientific and spiritual legacy have been preserved (2).

The first work that must be mentioned is ''Navodir Al-Usul fi Ma'rifat Akhbor Ar-Rasul'' ("Unique Principles of Learning about RasulAllah – the Messenger of God"). It consists of 291 [[Hadith]], and that to some extent it reflects the author's points of view, his outlook, his understanding the world. One copy of ''Navadir Al-Usul'' is kept in Tashkent, in the library of Muslim Board of Uzbekistan.

Other works of the scholar are: ''Khaqiyqat Al-Odamiyya'' ("Book about the Nature of a Man"), ''Adab an-Nafs'' ("Bringing up the Soul"). The majority of the works of Al Hakim At-Termizi reached us in the form of manuscripts and they are kept in different manuscript funds of the world. Conditionally they may be divided into five groups: manuscripts that are kept in Paris, Cairo, Damascus, Alexandria, Istanbul and London. The following works by Al Hakim At-Termizi are kept in the National Library of Paris (in the Arab department):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb124598267 |title=Tirmiḏī, Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī al-Ḥakīm al- (0820?–0932?) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=BnF catalogue général |publisher=Bibliothèque nationale de France |access-date= 11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.bnf.fr/12459826/muh_ammad_ibn__ali_al-h_akim_al-_tirmid_i/ |title=Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī al-Ḥakīm al- Tirmiḏī (0820?–0932?) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=data.bnf.fr |publisher=Bibliothèque nationale de France |access-date= 11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfonso Reyes Ochoa''' (17 May 1889 in [[Monterrey|Monterrey, Nuevo León]] – 27 December 1959 in [[Mexico City]]) was a Mexican writer, philosopher and diplomat. He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] five times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=7682 |title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Alfonso Reyes' parents were [[Bernardo Reyes]] and Aurelia Ochoa.  His father was in important government positions during the government of [[Porfirio Díaz]], such as the governorship of Nuevo León and the Secretary of War and Navy. Alfonso Reyes was educated primarily in [[Mexico City]].

In 1909, he and other like-minded young intellectuals such as [[Martín Luis Guzmán]] and [[José Vasconcelos]], founded the [[Ateneo de la Juventud]] to promote new cultural and aesthetic ideals and educational reform in Mexico. Other writers as [[Julio Torri]] and [[Pedro Henríquez Ureña|Pedro Enríquez Ureña]] also were part from the Ateneo and literary mates of Reyes. At the age of 21, Reyes published his first book, ''Cuestiones estéticas''. The following year, 1912, he wrote a short story, ''La Cena'' ("The Supper"), considered a forerunner of [[surrealism]] and of Latin American [[Magic realism|magical realism]]. In that year he was also named Secretary of the Escuela Nacional de Altos Estudios at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].

Reyes obtained his law degree in 1913, the same year that his father would die participating in an attempted coup d'état against the then president Francisco Madero.

Alfonso Reyes was posted to Mexico's diplomatic service in France in 1913. After Germany invaded France in 1914, he moved to [[Madrid]], Spain, and pursued a literary career as journalist, investigator, translator, critic, and writer. In 1915, he wrote what is probably his best-known essay, "Visión de Anáhuac (1915)," with its famous epigraph, "''Viajero: has llegado a la región más transparente del aire''", the source of the title of [[Carlos Fuentes]]'s novel ''La región más transparente''.

Reyes was reinstated in the diplomatic service in 1920. He was the second secretary in Spain in 1920,&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.sre.gob.mx/argentina/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=93&amp;op=page&amp;SubMenu= Biblioteca "Alfonso Reyes"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717190940/http://portal.sre.gob.mx/argentina/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=93&amp;op=page&amp;SubMenu= |date=17 July 2011 }}, Mexican Embassy in Argentina {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; was in Paris from 1924 to 1927, then served as the ambassador to [[Argentina]] (1927–30 and 1936–37). He was the Mexican ambassador to [[Brazil]] from 1930 to 1935 and again in 1938. In 1939, he retired from the diplomatic corps and returned to Mexico, where he organized what is today [[El Colegio de México]] and dedicated himself to writing and teaching.

==Stay in Spain==
During his time in Spain, where he resided from 1914 till 1924, it was considered his best creative period and when he became a great writer and master of literature.

In Spain, where he passed through hard financial times, he dedicated himself to literature and combined it with journalism; he worked in the [[Centro de Estudios Históricos]] ([[Historical Study Center]]) of Madrid under the direction of Sir [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]]. In 1919 he was named the Mexican commission secretary "[[Francisco del Paso y Troncoso]]", the same year that [[Cantar de mio Cid]] was put to prose.

Many of his friends insisted that he was a natural in Spanish and should pursue a career in politics, but he didn't follow their advice. One time he was presented with an offer to teach, but he rejected it too. He was more interested in the [[aesthetics]] of [[Benedetto Croce]]. He published numerous essays about poetry of the [[Spanish Golden Age]], standing out among them: [[Baroque]] y [[Góngora]]; on top of that he was one of the first writers to study poetry of the Nun [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]]. From 1917 he produced [[Cartones de Madrid]], his small masterpiece, [[Visión de Anáhuac]], [[El suicida]], and in 1921, [[El cazador]]. He was a collaborator of the magazines of "Revista de Filología Española", [[Revista de Occidente]] and "Revue Hisanique". His works about [[Spanish literature]], older [[classical literature]] and [[aesthetics]] are notable, and among the more notable of that time, "Cuestiones estéticas" (1911). In Spain he organized a ceremony on 11 September 1923 in the [[Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid]] ([[Real Botanical Garden of Madrid]]) to honor the memory of the symbolic poet [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].

After 1924 he developed a diplomatic and social life in Paris, Buenos Aires and Río de Janeiro. He translated a Mallarmé and edited his own literary mail, "Monterrey", publishing it in 1930. He wrote friends abroad in every part of the world and gave discourses, spoke at conferences and contributed to homages and cultural reunions.

He published among others, "Cuestiones gongorinas" (1927), "Capítulos de literatura española" (1939–195), "Discurso por Virgilio" (1931). His poetic works reveal a profound knowledge of the formal means, notably "Ifigenia cruel" (1924), "Pausa" (1926), "5 casi sonetos" (1931), "Otra voz" (1936) and "Cantata en la tumba de [[Federico García Lorca]]" (1937).

He left a left a legacy of work as a translator ([[Laurence Sterne]], [[G.K. Chesterton]], [[Anton Chekhov]]) and as an editor ([[Ruiz de Alarcón]], [[Cantar del mio Cid]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Baltasar Gracián]], [[Juan Ruiz]], [[Francisco de Quevedo]]).

== Legacy ==
The Argentinian writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] referred to Reyes as "the greatest prose writer in the Spanish language of any age".&lt;ref&gt;Borges, J. L., 1980, [http://bibliotecaignoria.blogspot.com/2007/04/jorge-luis-borges-de-siete-noches-noche_2744.html "La Ceguera"] ("Blindness") in ''Siete Noches''. Mexico City: Fondo de Cultura Económica: 156.&lt;/ref&gt; At least five avenues in [[Monterrey]]'s metropolitan area, three in the municipality and one in Mexico City are named after Reyes.

Several '''alternatives to the Ten Commandments''' have been promulgated by different persons and groups, which intended to improve on the lists of laws known as the [[Ten Commandments]] that appear in the [[Bible]]. Lists of these kinds exist in many different cultures and times. They are sometimes given names, example: [[Yamas]], but not always.

== Examples ==

===George Carlin===
[[George Carlin]] was an American [[stand-up]] comedian, social critic, actor, and author.

In 2001, in a bit in his twelfth HBO [[stand-up]] comedy special ''[[Complaints and Grievances]]'', George Carlin after making fun of the Ten Commandments initially suggested two commandments, and then added a third additional commandment.&lt;ref&gt;http://apatheticagnostic.com/articles/reflections/ref01/ref014d06.html&lt;/ref&gt;

# Thou shalt always be honest and faithful, especially to the provider of thy nookie.
# Thou shalt try real hard not to kill anyone, unless of course, they pray to a different invisible man from the one you pray to.
# Thou shalt keep thy religion to thy self.

=== Christopher Hitchens ===
[[Christopher Hitchens]] was an English American author, columnist, essayist, orator, religious and literary critic, social critic and journalist. 

His new Ten Commandments are:&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, Christopher, "[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/04/hitchens-201004 The New Commandments]", ''Vanity Fair'', April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=7514|title=Christopher Hitchens reading the Vanity Fair piece in video format|publisher=Commonsenseatheism.com|date=2010-03-08|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Do not condemn people on the basis of their ethnicity or their color.
# Do not ever even think of using people as private property, or as owned, or as slaves.
# Despise those who use violence or the threat of it in sexual relations.
# Hide your face and weep if you dare to harm a child.
# Do not condemn people for their inborn nature — why would God create so many homosexuals only in order to torture and destroy them?
# Be aware that you, too, are an animal, and dependent on the web of nature. Try and think and act accordingly.
# Do not imagine that you can escape judgment if you rob people with a false prospectus rather than with a knife.
# Turn off that fucking cell phone — you can have no idea how unimportant your call is to us.
# Denounce all jihadists and crusaders for what they are: psychopathic criminals with ugly delusions. And terrible sexual repressions.
# Be willing to renounce any god or any faith if any holy commandments should contradict any of the above.
::* In short: Don't swallow your moral code in tablet form.

=== Richard Dawkins ===
[[Richard Dawkins]] is an English ethologist, evolutionary biologist and author. 

These are the alternative to the Ten Commandments, cited by Dawkins in his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dawkins, Richard |title=The God Delusion |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2006 |page=406 |isbn=0-618-68000-4 |oclc= |doi=| authorlink = Richard Dawkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/new10c.html| title=The New Ten Commandments| accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Golden Rule|Do not do to others what you would not want them to do to you]].
# In all things, strive to cause no harm.
# Treat your fellow human beings, your fellow living things, and the world in general with love, honesty, faithfulness and respect.
# Do not overlook evil or shrink from administering justice, but always be ready to forgive wrongdoing freely admitted and honestly regretted.
# Live life with a sense of joy and wonder.
# Always seek to be learning something new.
# Test all things; always check your ideas against the facts, and be ready to discard even a cherished belief if it does not conform to them.
# Never seek to censor or cut yourself off from dissent; always respect the right of others to disagree with you.
# Form independent opinions on the basis of your own reason and experience; do not allow yourself to be led blindly by others.
# Question everything.

Dawkins uses these proposed commandments to make a larger point that "it is the sort of list that any ordinary, decent person today would come up with". He then adds four more of his own devising:
* Enjoy your own sex life (so long as it damages nobody else) and leave others to enjoy theirs in private whatever their inclinations, which are none of your business.
* Do not discriminate or oppress on the basis of sex, race or (as far as possible) species.
* Do not indoctrinate your children. Teach them how to think for themselves, how to evaluate evidence, and how to disagree with you.
* Value the future on a timescale longer than your own.

=== Bertrand Russell ===
[[Bertrand Russell]] was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, social critic, political activist and [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]].

He formulated these ten commandments:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panarchy.org/russell/decalogue.1951.html |author=Bertrand Russell |title=A Liberal Decalogue |date=1951 |publisher= Panarchy – A Gateway to Selected Documents and Web Sites |accessdate=2014-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Do not feel absolutely certain of anything.
# Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light.
# Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed.
# When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavour to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory.
# Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found.
# Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.
# Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.
# Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent than in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter.
# Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it.
# Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool's paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness.

=== Bayer and Figdor's Ten Non-Commandments ===
As detailed in the book ''[[Atheist Mind Humanist Heart|Atheist Mind, Humanist Heart]]: Re-writing the Ten Commandments for the Twenty-first Century'' by Lex Bayer and the Stanford Humanist Chaplain [[John Figdor]], it is devoted to the subject of creating a secular alternative to the Ten Commandments and encouraging readers to formulate and discover their own list of beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/10-commandments-for-atheists-a-guide-for-nonbelievers-who-want-to-explore-their-values/2014/11/20/766f8330-70e7-11e4-a2c2-478179fd0489_story.html |title=10 Commandments for atheists: a guide for nonbelievers who want to explore their values |accessdate=February 15, 2015 |publisher=The Washington Post |author=Kimberly Winston |date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atheistmindhumanistheart.com/ |title=Atheist Mind, Humanist Heart|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;     
# The world is real, and our desire to understand the world is the basis for belief.
# We can perceive the world only through our human senses.
# We use rational thought and language as tools for understanding the world.
# All truth is proportional to the evidence.
# There is no God.
# We all strive to live a happy life. We pursue things that make us happy and avoid things that do not.
# There is no universal moral truth. Our experiences and preferences shape our sense of how to behave.
# We act morally when the happiness of others makes us happy.
# We benefit from living in, and supporting, an ethical society.
# All our beliefs are subject to change in the face of new evidence, including these.

=== The Atheists' New Ten Commandments ===
These are the ten winning beliefs of the Rethink Prize, a crowdsourcing competition to rethink the Ten Commandments. The contest drew more than 2,800 submissions from 18 countries and 27 U.S. states. Winners were selected by a panel of judges.  
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/19/living/atheist-10-commandments/index.html?hpt=li_c2l |title=Behold, atheists' new Ten Commandments |accessdate=February 15, 2015 |publisher=CNN |author=Daniel Burke |date=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atheistmindhumanistheart.com/the-rethink-prize/ |title=The Rethink Prize|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;     
# Be open-minded and be willing to alter your beliefs with new evidence.
# Strive to understand what is most likely to be true, not to believe what you wish to be true.
# The scientific method is the most reliable way of understanding the natural world.
# Every person has the right to control of their body.
# God is not necessary to be a good person or to live a full and meaningful life.
# Be mindful of the consequences of all your actions and recognize that you must take responsibility for them.
# Treat others as you would want them to treat you, and can reasonably expect them to want to be treated. Think about their perspective.
# We have the responsibility to consider others, including future generations.
# There is no one right way to live.
# Leave the world a better place than you found it.

=== Ten Indian Commandments ===
The Bird Clan of East Central Alabama has the Ten Indian Commandments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdclan.org/tenc.htm|title=The Ten Indian Commandments|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Remain close to the Great Spirit.
# Show great respect for your fellow beings.
# Give assistance and kindness wherever needed.
# Be truthful and honest at all times.
# Do what you know to be right.
# Look after the well being of mind and body.
# Treat the earth and all that dwell there on with respect.
# Take full responsibility for your actions.
# Dedicate a share of your efforts to the greater good.
# Work together for the benefit of all man kind.

=== Summum ===
[[Summum]] is an informal gathering of people registered as a tax exempt organization in the state of [[Utah]], U.S., in 1975.

Summum contradicts the historical Biblical account of the Ten Commandments by claiming that prior to returning with the Commandments, Moses descended from [[Mount Sinai]] with a first set of tablets inscribed with seven principles they call aphorisms.

According to the group, the seven principles are:&lt;ref name="summum1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.summum.us/philosophy/tencommandments.shtml|title=The Aphorisms of Summum and the Ten Commandments|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="summum2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.summum.us/philosophy/principles.shtml|title=Principles of Creation|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# SUMMUM is MIND, thought; the universe is a mental creation.
# As above, so below; as below, so above.
# Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.
# Everything is dual; everything has an opposing point; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes bond; all truths are but partial truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.
# Everything flows out and in; everything has its season; all things rise and fall; the pendulum swing expresses itself in everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates.
# Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause; everything happens according to Law; Chance is just a name for Law not recognized; there are many fields of causation, but nothing escapes the Law of Destiny.
# Gender is in everything; everything has its masculine and feminine principles; Gender manifests on all levels.

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Antonio Francesco Davide Ambrogio Rosmini-Serbati''' ({{IPA-it|anˈtɔːnjo rozˈmiːni serˈbaːti}}; [[Rovereto]], 25 March 1797{{snd}}[[Stresa]], 1 July 1855) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] and [[philosopher]]. He founded the [[Rosminians]], officially the Institute of Charity or ''{{lang|it|Societas a charitate nuncupata}}'', pioneered the concept of social justice, and was a key figure in Italian [[Liberal Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kraynak |first1=Robert P. |title=The Origins of “Social Justice” in the Natural Law Philosophy of Antonio Rosmini |journal=The Review of Politics |date=2018 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=3-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alessandro Manzoni]] considered Rosmini the only contemporary Italian author worth reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mingardi |first1=Alberto |title=Intro to The Constitution Under Social Justice |date=2007 |publisher=Lexington Books |page=xl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Antonio Rosmini Serbati was born 24 March 1797, at Rovereto, in the Austrian Tyrol. He studied at the University of Padua, and was ordained priest at Chioggia, 21 April 1821. In 1822 he received a Doctorate in Theology and Canon Law.&lt;ref name=Cormack&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13194b.htm Cormack, George, and Daniel Hickey. "Rosmini and Rosminianism." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 15 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time Rosmini formulated his "Principle of Passivity". Rosmini felt compelled to ask himself: Do my plans spring more from my own subjective desire to do good than from a desire to do the will of God?”. Reflecting in this way, Rosmini articulated the principle in two parts: be ready to undertake any work of charity but only so long as it is God’s Providence that presents it; in the meantime, immerse oneself in the commitment to continual conversion, seeking the amendment of one’s own life.&lt;ref name=rosier&gt;[http://www.rosminians.ie/portfolio/new-page-builder/ "Antonio Rosmini", Rosminians, Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Institute of Charity===
In 1828 he founded at Monte Calvario near Domodossola, a new religious community, the Institute of Charity, known generally since as the [[Rosminians]]. In the autumn of 1830 he inaugurated the observance of the rule at Calvario, and from 1834 to 1835 had charge of a parish at Rovereto. Later foundations followed at Stresa and Domodossola. The Constitutions of the institute were approved by presented to [[Pope Gregory XVI]] on 20 December 1838. The institute spread rapidly in England and Italy, and requests for foundations came from various countries.&lt;ref name=Cormack/&gt;

The members might be priests or laymen, who devoted themselves to preaching, the education of youth, and works of universal charity—material, spiritual and intellectual. They work in [[Italy]], [[England]], [[Ireland]], [[France]], Wales, New Zealand, Kenya, Tanzania, India, Venezuela, and the [[United States]]. In London they were attached to the historical [[St Etheldreda's Church|Church of St Etheldreda]], Ely Place, Holborn.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Rosmini-Serbati, Antonio|volume=23|pages=738–739}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, [[Rosmini College]] School for Boys was founded in Auckland, New Zealand by Father Catcheside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosmini College|website=rosmini.school.nz|location=Auckland, NZ|publisher=|url=http://www.rosmini.school.nz/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosmini was retained as a political advisor to the then government of Piedmont. In August 1848, he was sent to Rome by King Charles Albert of Piedmont to enlist the pope on the side of Italy as against Austria.&lt;ref name=Cormack/&gt; Rosmini was invited to serve in the Roman Curia of [[Pope Pius IX]] as prime minister of the [[Papal States under Pope Pius IX|Papal States]]. He participated in the intellectual struggle which had for its object emancipation from [[Austria]], but as a trusted ecclesiastical advisor and diplomat he was not an initiator of the movement which ended in the freedom and unity of Italy. In fact, while eager for the deliverance of Italy from Austria, his aim was to bring about a confederation of the states of the country, which was to be under the control of the pope.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Upon establishment of the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]], the Pontiff was forced to flee and became estranged from his former advisor in political matters. The tenuous political circumstances made it very difficult to reconcile the two men's differing projects: innovative social and juridical reforms, however modest, fell victim to the more pressing existential needs of defending the supremacy of the Church's temporal powers.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Writings==
Rosmini's works, ''[[Of the five wounds of the Holy Church]]'' and ''The Constitution of Social Justice'' (see [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati#Works|Works]] below), aroused great opposition, especially among the [[Jesuits]], and in 1849 they were placed upon the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index]].&lt;ref name=Rosminians&gt;[http://www.rosmini.org/cause/beatit/Ros1.html Muratore, Umberto. "Antonio Rosmini", Centro Internazionale di studi Rosminiani]&lt;/ref&gt; Rosmini at once declared his submission and retired to [[Stresa]] on [[Lago Maggiore]], where he died. Before his death he had the satisfaction of learning that the works in question were dismissed, that is, proclaimed free from censure by the Congregation of the Index. Twenty years later, the word dismissed (''dimittantur'') became the subject of controversy, some maintaining that it amounted to a direct approval, others that it was purely negative and did not imply that the books were free from error.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; 
Vincenzo Maria Gatti, the Dominican professor of theology at the College of Saint Thomas, the forerunner of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Master of the Sacred Palace]], was instrumental in partially rehabilitating the works of Rosmini. In an article published in ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' on 16 June 1876, Gatti made clear that Pius IX did not intend the "dimittantur" as amounting to wholesale condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Cattaneo |first=Massimo |title=Gatti, Vincenzo Maria |encyclopedia=[[Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani]] |language=Italian |volume=52 |year=1999 |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/vincenzo-maria-gatti_(Dizionario_Biografico)/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522013137/http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/vincenzo-maria-gatti_%28Dizionario_Biografico%29/ |archivedate=22 May 2013 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy continued until 1887, however, when [[Pope Leo XIII]] condemned forty of Rosmini's propositions.

In 1998 he was named by [[Pope John Paul II]] in the encyclical ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' as one of the greater Christian thinkers.

==Thought==
The most comprehensive view of Rosmini's philosophical standpoint is to be found in his ''{{lang|it|Sistema filosofico}}'', in which he set forth the conception of a complete encyclopaedia of the human knowable, synthetically conjoined, according to the order of ideas, in a perfectly harmonious whole. Contemplating the position of recent philosophy from [[John Locke]] to [[Georg Hegel]], and having his eye directed to the ancient and fundamental problem of the origin, truth and certainty of our ideas, he wrote: "If philosophy is to be restored to love and respect, I think it will be necessary, in part, to return to the teachings of the ancients, and in part to give those teachings the benefit of modern methods" (''Theodicy'', a. 148). He examined and analysed the fact of human knowledge, and obtained the following results:
#that the notion or idea of being or existence in general enters into, and is presupposed by, all our acquired cognitions, so that, without it, they would be impossible
#that this idea is essentially objective, inasmuch as what is seen in it is as distinct from and opposed to the mind that sees it as the light is from the eye that looks at it
#that it is essentially true, because being and truth are convertible terms, and because in the vision of it the mind cannot err, since error could only be committed by a judgment, and here there is no judgment, but a pure intuition affirming nothing and denying nothing
#that by the application of this essentially objective and true idea the human being intellectually perceives, first, the animal body individually conjoined with him, and then, on occasion of the sensations produced in him not by himself, the causes of those sensations, that is, from the action felt he perceives and affirms an agent, a being, and therefore a true thing, that acts on him, and he thus gets at the external world, these are the true primitive judgments, containing
##the subsistence of the particular being (subject), and
##its essence or species as determined by the quality of the action felt from it ([[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]])
#that reflection, by separating the essence or species from the subsistence, obtains the full specific idea (universalization), and then from this, by leaving aside some of its elements, the abstract specific idea (abstraction)
#that the mind, having reached this stage of development, can proceed to further and further abstracts, including the first principles of reasoning, the principles of the several sciences, complex ideas, groups of ideas, and so on without end
#finally, that the same most universal idea of being, this generator and formal element of all acquired cognitions, cannot itself be acquired, but must be innate in us, implanted by God in our nature. Being, as naturally shining to our mind, must therefore be what men call the light of reason. Hence the name Rosmini gives it of ideal being; and this he laid down as the fundamental principle of all philosophy and the supreme criterion of truth and certainty. This he believed to be the teaching of St Augustine, as well as of St Thomas, of whom he was an ardent admirer and defender.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==The Cause for Canonization==
On 26 June 2006, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] signed a Decree of the [[heroic virtue]]s, and hence declared Rosmini to be [[Venerable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosmini.org/cause/chron.htm|title=A Chronological Summary of the Cause of Antonio Rosmini|website=rosmini.org|location=|publisher=Institute of Charity|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128132422/http://www.rosmini.org/cause/chron.htm |archive-date=28 January 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 June 2007, Pope Benedict XVI authorized the promulgation of a decree approving Rosmini's beatification. On 18 November 2007 he was beatified in [[Novara]], Italy.

==Works==

'''Autogenic training''' is a desensitization-[[relaxation technique]] developed by the [[Germany|German]] psychiatrist [[Johannes Heinrich Schultz]]&lt;ref name=Spencer&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/980240164|title=FLOTATION : a guide for sensory deprivation, relaxation, &amp; isolation tanks.|last=LACI.|first=SPENCER,|date=2015|publisher=LULU COM|isbn=9781329173750|location=[S.l.]|oclc=980240164}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which a psychophysiologically determined [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]] response is obtained.&lt;ref name=Stetter&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stetter|first=Friedhelm|last2=Kupper|first2=Sirko|date=2002-03-01|title=Autogenic Training: A Meta-Analysis of Clinical Outcome Studies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1014576505223|journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=45–98|doi=10.1023/a:1014576505223|issn=1090-0586}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was first published in 1932. Studying the self-reports of people immersed in a hypnotic state, J.H. Schultz noted that physiological changes are accompanied by certain feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Moral aspect of Autogenic Training|url= http://www.infotaste.com/moral-aspect-of-autogenic-training/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abbé Faria]] and [[Émile Coué]] are the forerunners of Schultz. The technique involves repetitions of a set of visualisations that induce a state of [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]] and is based on passive concentration of bodily perceptions (e.g., heaviness and warmth of arms, legs), which are facilitated by self-suggestions.&lt;ref name=Stetter /&gt;&lt;ref name=Barlow&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/144770991|title=Principles and practice of stress management|date=2007|publisher=Guilford Press|others=Lehrer, Paul M., Woolfolk, Robert L., Sime, Wesley E.|isbn=9781606230008|edition=3rd|location=New York|oclc=144770991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique is used to alleviate many [[stress (medicine)|stress]]-induced [[psychosomatic]] disorders.&lt;ref name=Barlow /&gt;

[[Biofeedback]] practitioners integrate basic elements of autogenic imagery and have simplified versions of parallel techniques that are used in combination with biofeedback. This was done at the [[Menninger Foundation]] by Elmer Green, Steve Fahrio, Patricia Norris, Joe Sargent, Dale Walters and others. They incorporated the hand warming imagery of autogenic training and used it as an aid to develop thermal biofeedback.&lt;ref name=Spencer/&gt;

==History==
The roots of this technique lie in the research carried out by [[Oskar Vogt|Oscar Vogt]] in the field of [[sleep]] and [[hypnosis]]. Vogt investigated individuals who had experience in hypnotic sessions. Under his guidance, they were able to go into a state (similar to a hypnotic state) for a self-determined period of time. These short-term mental exercises appeared to reduce stress or effects such as fatigue and tension. In the meantime, other disturbing effects (e.g. headaches) could be avoided. Inspired by this research and Vogt's work, [[Johannes Heinrich Schultz|Johannes Heinrich]] Schultz became interested in the phenomenon of [[autosuggestion]]. He wanted to explore an approach, which would avoid undesirable implications of hypnotherapy (e.g., the passivity of the individual and dependency on the therapist). When he was investigating hallucinations in healthy persons, he found that a majority of the subjects reported having two types of experienced sensation: heaviness in the extremities and feeling of warmth. Schultz wanted to understand whether simply imagining a state of heaviness and warmth in one's limbs could induce a state similar to hypnosis. Based on this idea he developed six basic exercises.&lt;ref name=Kanji,1997&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kanji|first=N.|date=1997-09-01|title=Autogenic training|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096522999780060X|journal=Complementary Therapies in Medicine|volume=5|issue=3|pages=162–167|doi=10.1016/s0965-2299(97)80060-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autogenic training was popularized in North America and the English-speaking world by [[Wolfgang Luthe]], who co-authored, with Schultz, a multi-volume tome on autogenic training. In 1963 Luthe discovered the significance of "autogenic discharges", paroxysmic phenomena of motor, sensorial, visual and emotional nature related to the traumatic history of the patient, and developed the method of "autogenic abreaction". His disciple [[Luis de Rivera]], a [[McGill University]]-trained psychiatrist, introduced [[psychodynamic]] concepts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rivera |first=José Luis González de |chapter=Autogenic psychotherapy and psychoanalysis |title=The body in psychotherapy: international congress, Geneva, February 1–3, 1996 |pages=176–181 |editor-last=Guimón |editor-first=J |location=Basel; New York |publisher=Karger |date=1997 |isbn=9783805562850 |oclc=36511904 |chapterurl=http://www.psicoter.es/_arts/pdf/97_C047_02.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; into Luthe's approach, developing "autogenic analysis"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rivera |first=José Luis González de |title=Autogenic analysis: the tool Freud was looking for |journal=International Journal of Psychotherapy |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=67–76 |year=2001 |doi=10.1080/13569080120042216 |url=http://psicoter.es/_arts/01_A166_01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a new method for uncovering the unconscious.

==Practice and effects==
The main purpose of autogenic training is the achievement of autonomic self-regulation by removing environmental distraction, training imagery that accompanies autonomic self-regulation, and by providing a facilitative set of exercises that are easy to learn and remember.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Linden|first=Wolfgang|date=1994-09-01|title=Autogenic Training: A narrative and quantitative review of clinical outcome|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01721069|journal=Biofeedback and Self-regulation|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=227–264|doi=10.1007/bf01721069|issn=0363-3586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autogenic training is based on 3 main principles:&lt;ref name=Kanji,1997 /&gt;
* Reduction of afferent stimulation (both exteroceptive and proprioceptive)
* Mental repetition of verbal formulae
* Passive concentration
In the context of autogenic training passive concentration means that the trainee is instructed to concentrate on inner sensations rather than environmental stimuli. Passiveness refers to allowing sensations to happen and being an observer rather than a manipulator.&lt;ref name=Barlow /&gt;

The training can be performed in different postures:&lt;ref name=Kanji,1997 /&gt;
* Simple sitting
* Reclined armchair
* Horizontal posture

The technique consists of six standard exercises according to Schultz:&lt;ref name=Kanji,1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47990|title=Autogenic therapy.|publisher=Grune &amp; Stratton|others=Luthe, Wolfgang,, Schultz, J. H. (Johannes Heinrich), 1884-1970.|isbn=9780808906643|location=New York,|oclc=47990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Muscular relaxation by repetition of a verbal formula, "My right arm is heavy", emphasizing heaviness.During the initial stages of the training, the feeling of heaviness in the trained arm is more expressed and occurs more rapidly. The same feeling can be experienced in the other extremities at the same time in the other arm. Within a week, a short concentration can trigger the sensation of heaviness in a trainee's arms and legs.&lt;ref name=Barlow /&gt;
# Passive concentration focuses on feeling warm, initiated by the instruction "My right arm is warm".
# Initiation of cardiac activity using the formula "My heartbeat is calm and regular".
# Passive concentration on the respiratory mechanism with the formula "It breathes me".
# Concentration on the warmth in the abdominal region with "My solar plexus is warm" formula.
# Passive concentration on coolness in the cranial region with the formula "My forehead is cool".

When a new exercise step is added in autogenic training, the trainee should always concentrate initially on the already learned exercises and then add a new exercise. In the beginning, a new exercise is added for only brief periods.&lt;ref name=Barlow /&gt;

According to the specific clinical needs, different modifications of formulas are used. These modifications can be classified into 3 main types:&lt;ref name=Barlow /&gt;
* Only a few formulas are used (e.g., the formulas of heaviness and warmth)
* The standard set of formulas is taught, but one specific formula is modified
* The standard set is used and a complementary, problem-specific formula is added.

A study by Spencer&lt;ref name=Spencer/&gt; suggests that autogenic training restores the balance between the activity of the [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] (flight or fight) and the [[parasympathetic]] (rest and digest) branches of the [[autonomic nervous system]]. The author hypothesizes that this can have important health benefits, as the parasympathetic activity promotes [[digestion]] and bowel movements, lowers the [[blood pressure]], slows the [[heart rate]], and promotes the functions of the [[immune system]].

== Neurophysiological aspects ==
There is a lack of neurophysiological investigations addressing this topic; however, one [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] study from 1963 suggests that the decrease in afferent stimulation induces:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luthe|first=W.|last2=Jus|first2=A.|last3=Geissmann|first3=P.|date=1963|title=Autogenic State and Autogenic Shift: Psychophysiologic and Neurophysiologic Aspects|url=http://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/285660|journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics|language=english|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1159/000285660|issn=0033-3190}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduction in reticulo-cortical activity
* Decrease in thalamo-cortical activity
* Functional changes in the structures connected to reticular system ([[hypothalamus]], [[limbic system]], [[red nucleus]], [[globus pallidus]])
The same study suggests that EEG patterns obtained from subjects with different level of practice are not similar.

Another study from 1958  hypothesizes that autogenic state is between the normal waking state and sleep. It suggests that EEG patterns occurring during autogenic training are similar to electrophysiological changes occurring during initial stages of [[sleep]].&lt;ref&gt;Israel,  L.,  &amp;  Rohmer,  F.  (1958).  Variations électroencéphalographiques  au  cours  de  la  relaxationautogène  et  hypnotique.In P. Aboulker, L. Chertok,&amp; M. Sapir(Eds.), pp 88-98, La relaxation: Aspects théoriques et pratiques Paris: Expansion Scientifique Française.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contraindications==
Autogenic training has been said to be contraindicated for people with heart conditions (e.g., individuals who have recently experienced [[myocardial infarction]]) or [[psychotic disorder]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosa |first=Karl Robert |year=1976 |title=Autogenic training |location=London |publisher=Victor Gollancz |isbn=0575021004 |oclc=2615822}}&lt;/ref&gt; for children below the age of 5 and the individuals whose symptoms cannot be controlled.&lt;ref name=Kanji,1997 /&gt;

==Clinical application and evidence==
Autogenic training has different applications and is used in a variety of pathophysiological conditions, such as [[Asthma|bronchial asthma]] or [[hypertension]], as well as psychological disorders e.g. [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name=Kanji,1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schultz/&gt; 
Autogenic training has been subject to clinical evaluation from its early days in Germany, and from the early 1980s worldwide.  In 2002, a [[meta-analysis]] of 60 studies was published in ''Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stetter |first1=Friedhelm |last2=Kupper |first2=Sirko |title=Autogenic training: a meta-analysis of clinical outcome studies |journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=45–98 |date=March 2002 |pmid=12001885 |doi=10.1023/A:1014576505223}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding significant positive effects of treatment when compared to normals over a number of diagnoses; finding these effects to be similar to best recommended rival therapies; and finding positive additional effects by patients, such as their perceived quality of life.

In Japan, researchers from the Tokyo Psychology and Counseling Service Center have formulated a measure for reporting clinical effectiveness of autogenic training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ikezuki |first1=M |last2=Miyauchi |first2=Y |last3=Yamaguchi |first3=H |last4=Koshikawa |first4=F |title=自律訓練法の臨床効果測定用尺度 (ATCES) の開発 [Development of Autogenic Training Clinical Effectiveness Scale (ATCES)] |language=Japanese |journal=心理学研究 (Shinrigaku Kenkyu) |volume=72 |issue=6 |pages=475–481 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11977841 |doi=10.4992/jjpsy.72.475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versus other relaxation techniques ==
The principle of passive concentration in autogenic training makes this technique different from other relaxation techniques such as [[progressive muscle relaxation]] and [[biofeedback]], in which trainees try to control physiological functions. As in biofeedback, bidirectional change in physiological activity is possible. Autogenic training is classified as a [[Self-hypnosis|self-hypnotic]] technique. It is different from hetero-hypnosis, where trance is induced by another individual. Autogenic training emphasizes a trainee's independence and gives control from therapist to the trainee. By this, the need for physiological feedback devices or a hypnotherapist is eliminated.&lt;ref name=Barlow /&gt;

{{wikisource|Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Biblical Accommodation}}

'''Biblical accommodation''' is the adaptation of words or sentences from the [[Bible]] to signify ideas different from those expressed therein. Thus, if a sinner excuses his fault by saying, "The serpent deceived me", he applies the scriptural words of Eve (Gen., iii, 13) to express an idea which the sentence does not convey in the Bible. Similarly, a blind person might use the words of Tob., v, 12, "What manner of joy shall be to me, who sit in darkness, and see not the light of heaven". Here, again, the words would have a meaning which they do not bear in Sacred Scripture. This accommodation is sometimes incorrectly styled the accommodated, or accommodative, sense of Scripture. From the definition it is clear that it is not a sense of Scripture at all. The possibility of such accommodation may arise, first, from some similarity between the ideas in the sacred text and the subject to which the passage is accommodated; secondly, from the fact that the words of Scripture may be understood in two different senses. The first is called extensive accommodation. Examples of it are found in the Church's offices, both in the [[Breviary]] and the [[Missal]], when the praises bestowed by the [[Holy Ghost]] on [[Noah|Noe]], [[Isaac]], and [[Moses]] are applied to other saints. Thus the words of Ecclus., xxxii, 1, 5: "Have they made thee ruler? . . . hinder not music" are sometimes applied to College presidents assuming the burden of their office; we need not say that the words of Sacred Scripture have quite a different meaning. The second species of accommodation, called allusive, is often a mere play on words and at times seems due to a misunderstanding of the original meaning. The [[Vulgate]] text, ''Mirabilis Deus in sanctis suis'' (Ps., lxvii, 36) means, in the mouth of the [[Psalmist]], that [[God]] is wonderful in His sanctuary (sancta, -orum). The Latin words may also be translated "God is wonderful in his saints" (sancti, -orum), and they are employed in this sense in the Missal. As this second signification was not intended by the inspired writer, the English rendering of the text in the [[Douay-Rheims]] version is a mistranslation.

==The use of accommodation in the Bible==

It is generally held by [[Catholic]] authors that certain passages from the [[Old Testament]] have been used over again in the [[New Testament]] with a change of meaning. In the Epistle to the Hebrews (xiii, 5) the words spoken to Josue, "I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee" (Jos., i, 5), are applied to all [[Christian]]s. Other examples of accommodation are the use of Exod., xvi, 18 in II Cor., viii, 15; Zach., iv, 14 in Apoc., xi, 4; Ps., vi, 9 in Matt., vii, 2, 3; Mich., vii, 6 in Matt, x, 36. Evidently, the new meaning attached to the words is also inspired. [[Rationalist]]ic writers have maintained that similar accommodations are to be found in every case where the [[Four Evangelists]] quote the prophecies of the Old Testament. Some few Catholic writers have been willing to grant this explanation for a few passages, but the words in which the Evangelists assert that events in Our Lord's life took place "in order that" the prophecies might be fulfilled are incompatible with the theory that they wished to indicate only a resemblance between the event and the prophet's words. It is probable that no prophecy is used in the Gospels merely by accommodation.

New Testament quotations of Old Testament predictions often seem to modern readers to be accommodations, striking or forced as the case may be, while the New Testament writer, "following the exegetical methods current among the Jews of his time, Matthew ii. 15, 18, xxvi. 31, xxvii. 9",&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Rolles Driver]] in ''Zechariah'' in ''Century Bible'', pp. 259, 271&lt;/ref&gt; puts them forward as arguments. To say that he is merely "describing a New Testament fact in Old Testament phraseology" may be true of the result rather than of his design.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Accommodation|volume=1|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catholic rules for accommodation==

Accommodation is used in the Liturgy and by the [[Fathers of the Church]]; texts have been accommodated by preachers and ascetical authors. Many of the sermons of [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]] are mosaics of Scripture phrases. The [[Council of Trent]]  forbade the wresting of Scripture to profane uses (Sess. IV, Decret. "De editione et usu Sacrorum Librorum "). Typical rules for guidance in the accommodation of Scripture are:

* Accommodated texts should never be used as arguments drawn from revelation.
* Accommodation should not be farfetched.
* Accommodations should be reverent.

==Apologetics==
German 18th-century [[rationalism]] held that the Biblical writers made great use of conscious accommodation, intending moral commonplaces when they seemed to be enunciating Christian dogmas. Another expression for this, used, for example, by [[Johann Salomo Semler]], is "economy," which also occurs in the kindred sense of "reserve" (or of ''Disciplina Arcani'', a modern term for the supposed early Catholic habit of reserving [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] truths). [[Isaac Williams]] on ''Reserve in Religious Teaching'', No. 80 of ''[[Tracts for the Times]]'', made a great sensation, and was commented on by [[Richard William Church]] in ''[[Oxford Movement|The Oxford Movement]]''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The '''boulevard rule''' is a principle in [[United States]] [[traffic law]] which states that the driver of a vehicle entering a highway from a smaller road or entrance (called the ''unfavored driver'') must stop and yield the [[Right-of-way (traffic)|right of way]] to all oncoming highway traffic (the ''favored drivers'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 7th ed. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  The rule often comes into play in [[road accident]] cases, when a court must determine if a driver is [[Negligence|negligent]] in causing a collision, due to his breach of the [[duty of care]] imposed by the rule on the unfavored driver.

[[Maryland]]&lt;ref&gt;Md. Transportation Code § 21-403&lt;/ref&gt; is among the [[U.S. state]]s which follow this rule, but not all states have similar provisions in [[statute]]s or [[case law]]. [[New York (state)|New York]]&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Vehicle &amp; Traffic Code § 1143&lt;/ref&gt; applies the rule to traffic entering public roads from private driveways or alleys, but not where public roads intersect.

'''Carl Cohen''' (born April 30, 1931) is Professor of [[Philosophy]] at the [[Residential College, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor|Residential College]] of the [[University of Michigan]], in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], USA. He is co-author of "The Animal Rights Debate" (Rowman and Littlefield, 2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Animal rights: a reference handbook |last=Sherry |first=Clifford J. |pages=145–146 |year=2009 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=978-1-59884-191-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a point-counterpoint volume with Prof. [[Tom Regan]]; he is also the author of "Democracy" (Macmillan, 1972); the author of "Four Systems" (Random House, 1982); the editor of "Communism, Fascism, and Democracy" (McGraw Hill, 1997); the co-author (with J. Sterba) of "Affirmative Action and Racial Preference" (Oxford, 2003), co-author (with [[Irving Copi|I. M. Copi]]) of "Introduction to Logic, 13th edition" (Prentice-Hall, 2008), and author of "A Conflict of Principles: The Battle over Affirmative Action at the University of Michigan" (University Press of Kansas, 2014).

He has published many essays in moral and political philosophy in philosophical, medical, and legal journals. He has served as a member of the Medical School faculty of the University of Michigan, and as Chairman of the University of Michigan faculty, where he has been an active member of the philosophy faculty since 1955.  In 2006 the University held a celebration honoring his 50 years on the faculty.

== Historical influence and political influence==

===University of Michigan Residential College===
During the years 1964-67 Cohen, then an Associate Prof. of Philosophy, was an active member of the small planning committee for the Residential College of the University of Michigan. He became the principal author of the "Blue Book" which laid the intellectual foundations for the Residential College. When the Residential College opened in 1967 Cohen became a full-time member of its faculty, and his appointment was shifted from the Department of Philosophy to the Residential College, where he remains the only one of that founding group serving as an active member of the Michigan faculty.

In 1998 anonymous donations totaling some $13,000 were made to the university to name a reading room in the Residential College in Cohen's honor. This was done; a plaque honoring him was placed. It was removed shortly afterwards, however, the reason given being "procedural violations." Many in the University believed that Cohen was being discriminated against because of his outspoken and unpopular opposition to the race-conscious admissions system of the University. Senior members of the Law School faculty, and other faculties, who did not agree with Cohen's views on the admissions matter, nevertheless wrote angrily to the President, Lee Bollinger, in the conviction that technical violations of procedure were being arbitrarily invoked against him, and that the reputation of the University had been besmirched. The President agreed to replace the plaque and to reaffirm the name of the Reading Room; Cohen agreed that his own donation of $10,000 to the University for the room be made public.

===Racial preference issues===
In 1996, Cohen made public information he had gathered using the State of Michigan's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) about the substantial weight of racial factors in the University of Michigan undergraduate admissions office use of a "grid system". Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher sued the University based on this data. Barbara Grutter, in a separate proceeding, sued the Law School of the University of Michigan relying on additional data also revealed by Cohen's FOIA inquiry.  While the U-M changed its "grid system" to a "point system" the following year, it argued that both mechanical systems were identical in outcome and that the point system, which became more famous, was designed merely to be easier to understand. The system that Cohen made public was ruled unconstitutional by the U. S. Supreme Court [in Gratz v. Bollinger, 2003] as a "mechanical system," although in a separate ruling concerning the U-M Law School [Grutter v. Bollinger, 2003], the limited use of non-mechanical preferences was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Leveling the playing field: justice, politics, and college admissions |last=Fullinwider |first=Robert K. |author2=Judith Lichtenberg |pages=180–181 |year=2004 |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |isbn=978-0-7425-1411-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings on June 23, 2003, Cohen, Gratz, Grutter, and others were among those who invited [[Ward Connerly]] to Michigan, where he appeared in a July 8, 2003, speech on the Michigan campus announcing the formation of the [[Michigan Civil Rights Initiative]] (MCRI), to forbid preference by race or nationality in the state. This became Proposition 2 (06-2) in Michigan, appearing on the November 8, 2006, ballot. Cohen was a leading spokesperson for Proposition 2 in a heated electoral campaign. Proposition 2 passed by a 58%–42% margin. As a result of Cohen's involvement in the issue, he has appeared on numerous panels and in media reports on racial preferences since the mid-1990s.

===Civil liberties activism===
Cohen has been a lifetime activist for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), serving as Chair of the Michigan affiliate of the ACLU, and for years as a  member of the National Board of Directors of the ACLU.

When the [[American Nazi Party]] threatened, in 1978, to march in [[Skokie, Illinois]], Cohen published (in ''The Nation'' to which he was a regular contributor) several widely reprinted essays defending the right to present publicly even the most abhorrent political views. [See: "The Extreme Test of Free Speech," ''The Nation'', 15 April 1978] When (as a part of the protest against the [[Vietnam War]]) efforts were made to forbid research of certain kinds on the U-M campus, Cohen strongly supported the freedom of faculty members to engage in the inquiries that they thought appropriate. During that war Cohen, in active protest, defended selective conscientious objection [See: "The Case for Selective Pacifism," ''The Nation'', 8 July 1968], and defended some, but not all, civil disobedience. [See: "Civil Disobedience and the Law," Rutgers Law Review, Fall, 1966.] When University administrators sought to censor the showing of sexually explicit films on campus, Cohen, then serving as Chair of the University faculty, strongly defended student freedoms before the Regents of the University, with ultimate success. In the mid-1970s, when the fear of misuse led some to oppose the continuation of research in [[Molecular cloning|recombinant DNA technology]], Cohen defended such research vigorously, both on the Michigan campus and also in ''The New England Journal of Medicine'' ["When May Research Be Stopped?" ''NEJM'' 26 May 1977.]

Cohen maintains his membership in the ACLU despite his disagreement with the organization's support of race preferences in university admissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chetlyzarko.com/cohen-moss.html Open letter from Cohen to Michigan ACLU President Kary Moss] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001516/http://www.chetlyzarko.com/cohen-moss.html |date=September 27, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research ethics===
From 1985 to 1995 a fraction of Cohen's appointment was in the Medical School of the University of Michigan, where he served as Professor of Philosophy and as Director of the Program in Human Values in Medicine. There he served also as a founding member of the Michigan Medical Center's Ethics Committee, as a member of its [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee]], and for more than 30 years, as a member of its [[Institutional Review Board|Institutional Review Board (IRB)]]. Cohen's involvement with research on humans led to reflections on the uses of animals in science, which he defends [See: "The Case for the Use of Animals in Biomedical Research," ''New England Journal of Medicine'', 2 October 1986]; and on the limited uses of [[Experimentation on prisoners|prisoners as research subjects]], which he also defends [see: "Medical Experimentation on Prisoners," ''[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]]'', Spring, 1978]; on ethical issues in transplant medicine (See: "Alcoholics and Liver Transplantation," ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', 13 March 1991); and on abortion (See: "How Not to Argue about Abortion," ''The Michigan Quarterly Review'', Fall, 1990).

===Labor arbitration activities===
Having written much about the concept of justice, Cohen became involved, during the 1970s, in the process of Labor/Management arbitration. With the support of the late Prof. William Haber (Economics, U-M), a well-known arbitrator, Cohen became a member of the Labor Panel of the American Arbitration Association, and over the years has issued many arbitration awards in many industries. Cohen remains an active arbitrator for the AAA, and also an Act 312 Arbitrator, and Grievance Arbitrator, for the State of Michigan.

'''The Code of the U.S. Fighting Force''' is a code of conduct that is an ethics guide and a United States Department of Defense directive consisting of six articles to members of the United States Armed Forces, addressing how they should act in combat when they must evade capture, resist while a prisoner or escape from the enemy. It is considered an important part of U.S. military doctrine and tradition, but is not formal military law in the manner of the Uniform Code of Military Justice or public international law, such as the Geneva Conventions.

==History==
{{Cleanup|section|reason=Written in an inappropriate ''narrative'' and ''editorializing'' style, rather than Wikipedia's encyclopaedic style.|date=April 2018}}
During the [[Korean War]] in the early 1950s, Chinese and North Korean forces captured American [[military personnel]] as [[prisoners of war]]. Unlike America's previous wars, these American prisoners then faced a deadly new enemy, the ''Eastern World's'' POW environment. It was the first American war that U.S. prisoners of war were viewed by an enemy as more than soldiers from the other side temporarily restrained from conducting war and whose desire to control the minds of U.S. prisoners extended the war into the [[POW camps]]. North Korean and Chinese communists were not hesitant to use brutal and bloody [[torture]] as gruesome tools in their efforts to exploit U.S. prisoners of war into making public statements that appeared favorable to the communist war effort.  For the American prisoners brutal torture, lack of food, absence of medical aid, and subhuman treatment became a daily way of life and many of them found that their training had not prepared them for this new battlefield.&lt;ref name="COC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunsan.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123241828|title=The military Code of Conduct: a brief history|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316204551/http://www.kunsan.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123241828|archivedate=16 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TOT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmcpress.com/heritage/code_conduct.htm|title=Code of Conduct|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although collaborating with the enemy is nothing new (and there were a number of examples of it during [[World War II]]), its ramifications caused considerable damage to the morale and survival of U.S. POWs during the Korean War and later the [[Vietnam War]]. Before the Korean War, American prisoners in previous wars were subjected to inhumane and brutal treatment but the enemy did not take it upon itself to tear down the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] within the prisoner ranks. When the communists succeeded, a condition of distrust among the prisoners became the norm rather than the exception. Morale dropped and mutual assistance among the prisoners lessened. Chaos followed and the failure of the POWs to care for their fellow prisoners resulted in a higher death rate and made the captives more amenable to accept the doctrine of their captors.&lt;ref name="COC" /&gt;&lt;ref name=TOT /&gt;

One of the most elaborate propaganda efforts was the 1952 POW Olympics held in Pyuktong, North Korea. For 12 days in November, approximately 500 prison athletes from Britain, South Korea, Australia, Turkey, and the U.S. competed against other camps in events mirroring the World Olympics such as baseball, boxing, and track and field. This effort was publicized to show the world just how well the UN prisoners were treated. Of course, this was not the reality. Very few American servicemen were mentally prepared to protect themselves from such barbaric treatment and intense indoctrination attempts. Through inhumane treatment and manipulation, many prisoners were forced to collaborate with the communists.&lt;ref name="COC" /&gt;&lt;ref name=TOT /&gt;

After the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|termination of the hostilities in Korea]] and the subsequent release of American prisoners of war, [[List of American and British defectors in the Korean War|twenty-one Americans chose to remain in China]], refusing [[repatriation]]. Many former U.S. prisoners coming back to their homeland were criminally charged and tried for offenses that "amounted to [[treason]], [[desertion]] to the enemy, mistreatment of fellow prisoners of war, and similar crimes." The emotions and compassion of the public were aroused, as graphic details of the inhumane treatment of U.S. POWs in communist prison camps surfaced during the trials. Public discussion caused intense arguments over what should have been done about Americans who were "brainwashed" in Korea and what to do about those in future wars who may be the recipients of similar bloody treatment.&lt;ref name="COC" /&gt;&lt;ref name=TOT /&gt;

On August 7, 1954, the United States Secretary of Defense directed that a committee be formed to recommend a suitable approach for conducting a comprehensive study of the problems related to the entire Korean War POW experience. The work of that committee resulted in the May 17, 1955 appointment of the Defense Advisory Committee on Prisoners of War, headed by Carter L. Burgess, [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy|assistant secretary of defense for Manpower and Personnel]]. The committee took heed of the ongoing divisive debate, noting that while all services had regulations governing the conduct of prisoners of war, "the United States armed forces have never had a clearly defined code of conduct applicable to American prisoners after capture."&lt;ref name="COC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TOT" /&gt;

Colonel Franklin Brooke Nihart, [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]], worked at Marine Corps headquarters throughout the summer of 1955, outlined his ideas in longhand and the Code of Conduct was established with the issuance of [[s:Executive Order 10631|Executive Order 10631]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] on 17 August 1955 which stated, "Every member of the Armed Forces of the United States are expected to measure up to the standards embodied in the Code of Conduct while in combat or in captivity." It has been modified twice&amp;mdash;once in 1977 by President [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[s:Executive Order 12017|Executive Order 12017]], and most recently in President [[Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan's]] [[s:Executive Order 12633|Executive Order 12633]] of March 1988, which amended the code to make it [[Gender-neutral pronoun|gender-neutral]].

Notably, the code prohibits [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] except when "all reasonable means of resistance [are] exhausted and...certain death the only alternative," enjoins captured Americans to "resist by all means available" and "make every effort to escape and aid others," and bars the acceptance of [[parole]] or special favors from enemy forces. The code also outlines proper conduct for American prisoners of war, reaffirms that under the Geneva Conventions prisoners of war should give "name, [[Military rank|rank]], [[service number]], and [[Birthday|date of birth]]" and requires that under [[interrogation]] captured military personnel should "evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability."

==Executive Order 10631: Code of Conduct for members of the Armed Forces of the United States==
The authority for establishing the Code of Conduct, communication of intent, and assignment of responsibilities are outlined in the first three paragraphs of Executive Order 10631.

{{quote|By virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, and as Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the United States, I hereby prescribe the Code of Conduct for Members of the Armed Forces of the United States which is attached to this order and hereby made a part thereof.

All members of the Armed Forces of the United States are expected to measure up to the standards embodied in this Code of Conduct while in combat or in captivity. To ensure achievement of these standards, members of the armed forces liable to capture shall be provided with specific training and instruction designed to better equip them to counter and withstand all enemy efforts against them, and shall be fully instructed as to the behavior and obligations expected of them during combat or captivity.

The Secretary of Defense (and the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard except when it is serving as part of the Navy) shall take such action as is deemed necessary to implement this order and to disseminate and make the said Code known to all members of the armed forces of the United States.&lt;ref name="EO10631"&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/10631.html "Executive Order 10631"] National Archives. Retrieved 19 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Articles of Code of Conduct==
The Code of Conduct provides guidance for the behavior and actions of members of the Armed Forces of the United States. This guidance applies not only on the battlefield, but also in the event that the service member is captured and becomes a prisoner of war (POW). The Code is delineated in six articles.

{{quote|
'''Article I:'''

I am an American, fighting in the forces which guard my country and our way of life. I am prepared to give my life in their defense.&lt;ref name="EO10631"&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/10631.html "Executive Order 10631"] National Archives. Retrieved 19 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Article II:'''

I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command, I will never surrender the members of my command while they still have the means to resist.&lt;ref name="EO10631"/&gt;

'''Article III:'''

If I am captured I will continue to resist by all means available. I will make every effort to escape and aid others to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy.&lt;ref name="EO10631"/&gt;

'''Article IV:'''

If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will give no information or take part in any action which might be harmful to my comrades. If I am senior, I will take command. If not, I will obey the lawful orders of those appointed over me and will back them up in every way.&lt;ref name="EO10631"/&gt;

'''Article V:'''

When questioned, should I become a prisoner of war, I am required to give name, rank, service number and date of birth. I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability. I will make no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and its allies or harmful to their cause.&lt;ref name="EO10631"/&gt;

'''Article VI:'''

I will never forget that I am an American, fighting for freedom, responsible for my actions, and dedicated to the principles which made my country free. I will trust in my God and in the United States of America.&lt;ref name="EO10631"/&gt;}}

'''Daniel O. Nathan''' is an American philosopher and Professor of [[Philosophy]] at [[Texas Tech University]]. 
He is known for his expertise on [[aesthetics]], [[ethical theory]], and [[philosophy of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Clercq|first1=Rafael|title=The aesthetic creation theory of art|journal=[[Sztuka i Filozofia]]|date=2009|volume=35|url=https://philarchive.org/archive/DECTAC-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Experimentalism''' is the philosophical belief that the way to truth is through [[experiment]]s and [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/experimentalism |title=Experimentalism |work=Your Dictionary |publisher=LoveToKnow Corporation |accessdate=29 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also associated with [[instrumentalism]], the belief that truth should be evaluated based upon its demonstrated usefulness. Deborah Mayo suggests that we should focus on how experimental knowledge is actually arrived at and how it functions in science&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worrall|first=John|last2=Mayo|first2=Deborah G.|last3=Smart|first3=J. J. C.|last4=Barnes|first4=Barry|date=2000-07-01|title=What is this thing called philosophy of science?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02913603|journal=Metascience|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=172–198|doi=10.1007/BF02913603|issn=0815-0796}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Mayo also suggests that the reason New Experimentalists have come up short, is that the part of experiments that have the most to offer in building an account of inference and evidence that are left untapped: designing, generating, modelling and analysing experiments and data.

Less formally, artists often pursue their visions through trial and error; [[experimental arts|this form]] of experimentalism has been practiced in every field, from [[Experimental music|music]] to [[Experimental film|film]] and from [[Experimental literature|literature]] to [[Experimental theatre|theatre]].

'''Sardar Fazlul Karim''' ({{lang-bn|সরদার ফজলুল করিম}}; 1 May 1925 – 15 June 2014) was a scholar, academic, philosopher and essayist in [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name="Daily Star 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=  |first= |title=Sardar Fazlul Karim's 86th birthday today|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=183927|accessdate=12 December 2011|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Junaidul Haque"&gt;{{cite news|last=Haque|first=Junaidul|title=The life of a man of commitment|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/story.php?nid=6724|accessdate=12 December 2011|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in a lower-middle-class family of [[Barisal]] in 1925, Sardar stood second at IA examination (Intermediate in Arts) but topped the first class in both his BA Honours and MA examinations in Philosophy from [[Dhaka University]]; he became a lecturer in 1946 at the age of 21. Involved in progressive politics as a student, he was an "enemy" of the then [[East Pakistan|Pakistan government]] and in four phases spent almost the full twenty-four years of Pakistani rule in jail. [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] and [[Abdul Monem Khan|Monem Khan]] ensured that he could never return to his teaching job during the Pakistan period. He participated in the 58-day hunger strike of political prisoners demanding humane treatment. He was elected a member of [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan]] while in prison. ''Bangabandhu'' [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] and [[Abdur Razzaq (Professor)|National Professor Abdur Razzak]] brought him back to the [[Dhaka University]] immediately after the independence of Bangladesh in 1972.&lt;ref name="Daily Star 2011"/&gt;

Sardar Fazlul Karim has written scholarly books on philosophy, among them being his দর্শনকোষ (Bengali Encyclopedia of Philosophy). He has translated [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Rousseau]] and [[Engels]].

When Sardar was a high school student, [[Saratchandra Chatterjee]]'s novel ''Pather Dabi'' (Demand for a Pathway) inspired him to dream of a revolution for the first time; his friend Mozammel Haq had given him the book. Young Mozammel, a political activist and journalist, died in 1965 Cairo plane crash. The book greatly influenced the teenaged Sardar. Years later he learnt that the same book had inspired Jyoti Basu to be a revolutionary. Sardar Fazlul Karim was always an obedient child and even helped his father in agricultural work.

Sardar Fazlul Karim came to Dhaka to study Intermediate in Arts (IA). He got admitted to the Government Intermediate College. Progressive students looked him up. Sardar was more a nationalist than a communist then. He brought out wallpapers and had a good personal library. Friends used to borrow books from him. [[Pearl Buck]]'s [[The Good Earth]] also influenced him. Sardar Fazlul Karim became a student of [[Dhaka University]] in 1942; he studied English for a few days but shifted to Philosophy because [[Haridas Bhattacharya]]'s class lectures had attracted him.&lt;ref name="Junaidul Haque"/&gt; He passed his BA Honours in 1945 when the Second World War ended. The [[Bengal famine of 1943|1943's Bengal famine]] influenced him a lot. The communists were very active during the Bengal famine. Sardar left Socrates, Plato and Hegel in his room and travelled to remote villages with relief for the hungry!

'''Foolishness''' is the unawareness or lack of [[Norm (social)| social norms]] which causes offence, annoyance, trouble and/or injury. The things such as [[impulsivity]] and/or [[Social influence| influences]] may affect a person's ability to make otherwise [[Reason| reasonable]] [[Decision-making| decisions]]. In this sense, it differs from [[stupidity]], which is the lack of [[intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Why Smart People Can Be So Stupid |author=Robert J. Sternberg |chapter=Smart People Are Not Stupid, But They Sure Can Be Foolish |pages=232 et seq. |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=9780300101706}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An act of foolishness is called '''folly'''.

Andreas Maercker in 1995 defined foolishness as rigid, dogmatic, and inflexible thinking which makes feelings of bitterness and probable annoyance. It is considered the foundation of illusions of grandiosity like omniscience, omnipotence and inviolability.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

The [[Book of Proverbs]] characterizes traits of foolishness.&lt;ref&gt;Eldon Woodcock, [Proverbs: A Topical Study https://books.google.com/books?id=tbVKAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20] {{ISBN|9781579108182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foolishness and wisdom are contrasted in Paul's [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|letter to the Corinthians]].  He condemns intellectual arrogance and advocates a humble attitude instead of foolishness, in which it is then possible to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eLqvm8PqyCMC&amp;pg=PA40 |title=The Letters to the Corinthians |author=William Barclay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frithjof Schuon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|uː|ɒ|n}}; {{IPA-de|ˈfʀiːtˌjoːf ˈʃuː.ɔn|lang}}) (June 18, 1907 &amp;ndash; May 5, 1998), also known as '''Īsā Nūr al-Dīn''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincent Cornell]], ''Voices of Islam: Voices of the spirit'', Greenwood Publishing Group (2007), p. xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; was an author of German ancestry born in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]. He was a philosopher and metaphysician inspired by the [[Hindu]] philosophy of [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Sufism]] and the author of numerous books on religion and spirituality. He was also a poet and a painter.

In his prose and poetic writings, Schuon focuses on metaphysical doctrine and spiritual method. He is considered one of the main representatives and an exponent of the ''[[Perennial philosophy|religio perennis]]'' (perennial religion) and one of the chief representatives of the [[Traditionalist School]]. In his writings, Schuon expresses his faith in an absolute principle, God, who governs the universe and to whom our souls would return after death. For Schuon the great revelations are the link between this absolute principle—God—and mankind. He wrote the main bulk of his work in French. In the later years of his life Schuon composed some volumes of poetry in his mother tongue, German. His articles in French were collected in about 20 titles in French which were later translated into English as well as many other languages. The main subjects of his prose and poetic compositions are spirituality and various essential realms of the human life coming from God  and returning to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Life and work==

Schuon was born in Basel, Switzerland, on June 18, 1907. His father was a native of southern [[Germany]], while his mother came from an Alsatian family. Schuon's father was a concert violinist and the household was one in which not only music but literary and spiritual culture were present. Schuon lived in Basel and attended school there until the untimely death of his father, after which his mother returned with her two young sons to her family in nearby [[Mulhouse]], [[France]], where Schuon was obliged to become a French citizen. Having received his earliest training in German, he received his later education in French and thus mastered both languages early in life.&lt;ref name="Frithjof Schuon: Life and Work"/&gt;

From his youth, Schuon's search for metaphysical truth led him to read the [[Hindu]] scriptures such as ''[[Upanishads]]'' and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''. While still living in Mulhouse, he discovered the works of [[René Guénon]], the French philosopher and [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]], which served to confirm his intellectual intuitions and which provided support for the metaphysical principles he had begun to discover.&lt;ref name="Frithjof Schuon: Life and Work"/&gt;

Schuon journeyed to [[Paris]] after serving for a year and a half in the French army. There he worked as a textile designer and began to study [[Arabic]] in the local mosque school. Living in Paris also brought the opportunity to be exposed to various forms of traditional art to a much greater degree than before, especially the arts of [[Asia]] with which he had had a deep affinity since his youth. This period of growing intellectual and artistic familiarity with the traditional worlds was followed by Schuon's first visit to [[Algeria]] in 1932. It was then that he met the celebrated [[Shaykh]] [[Ahmad al-Alawi]] and was initiated into his order.&lt;ref&gt;Frithjof Schuon, ''Songs Without Names, Volumes VII-XII'', (World Wisdom, 2007) p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Schuon has written about his deep affinity with the esoteric core of various traditions and hence appreciation for the Sufism in the Islamic tradition. His main reason for seeking the blessings of Shaykh Al-Alawi being exactly the attachment to an orthodox master and Saint.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Aymard and Patrick Laude. Frithjof Schuon, life and teachings. SUNY press 2002&lt;/ref&gt; On a second trip to North Africa, in 1935, he visited Algeria and [[Morocco]]; and during 1938 and 1939 he traveled to [[Egypt]] where he met Guénon, with whom he had been in correspondence for 27 years. In 1939, shortly after his arrival in Pie, India, [[World War II]] broke out, forcing him to return to Europe. After having served in the French army, and having been made a prisoner by the Germans, he sought asylum in Switzerland, which gave him Swiss nationality and was to be his home for forty years. In 1949 he married, his wife being a German Swiss with a French education who, besides having interests in religion and metaphysics, was also a gifted painter.&lt;ref name="Frithjof Schuon: Life and Work"&gt;[http://www.worldwisdom.com/public/authors/Frithjof-Schuon.aspx Frithjof Schuon's life and work.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following World War II, Schuon accepted an invitation to travel to the [[American West]], where he lived for several months among the [[Plains Indians]], in whom he always had a deep interest. Having received his education in France, Schuon has written all his major works in French, which began to appear in English translation in 1953. Of his first book, ''The Transcendent Unity of Religions'' (London, Faber &amp; Faber) [[T. S. Eliot]] wrote: "I have met with no more impressive work in the comparative study of Oriental and Occidental religion."&lt;ref name="Frithjof Schuon: Life and Work"/&gt;

While always continuing to write, Schuon and his wife traveled widely. In 1959 and again in 1963, they journeyed to the American West at the invitation of friends among the [[Sioux]] and [[Crow Nation|Crow]] [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]]. In the company of their Native American friends, they visited various Plains tribes and had the opportunity to witness many aspects of their sacred traditions. In 1959, Schuon and his wife were solemnly adopted into the Sioux family of James Red Cloud, descendant of [[Red Cloud]]. Years later they were similarly adopted by the Crow [[medicine man]] and [[Sun Dance]] chief, [[Thomas Yellowtail]]. Schuon's writings on the central rites of Native American religion and his paintings of their ways of life attest to his particular affinity with the spiritual universe of the Plains Indians. Other travels have included journeys to [[Andalusia]], Morocco, and a visit in 1968 to the reputed home of the Virgin Mary in [[Ephesus]].

Through his many books and articles, Schuon became known as a spiritual teacher and leader of the [[Traditionalist School]]. During his years in Switzerland he regularly received visits from well-known religious scholars and thinkers of the East.&lt;ref name="Frithjof Schuon: Life and Work"/&gt;

Schuon throughout his entire life  had great respect for and devotion to the Virgin Mary which was expressed in his writings. As a result, his teachings and paintings show a particular Marian presence. His reverence for the Virgin Mary has been studied in detail by American professor [[James Cutsinger]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.cutsinger.net/pdf/colorless_light_and_pure_air.pdf "Colorless Light and Pure Air: The Virgin in the Thought of Frithjof Schuon"] for some reflections, and J.-B. Aymard’s "Approche biographique" for chronological details.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the name, ''Maryamiya'' (in Arabic, "Marian"), of the Sufi order he founded as a branch of the Shadhiliya-[[Darqawa|Darqawiya]]-[[Ahmad al-Alawi|Alawiya]]. When asked by one of his disciples about the reason for this choice of name, Schuon replied: "It is not we who have chosen her; it is she who has chosen us."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lings, ''A Return to the Spirit'', Fons Vitae, Kentucky, 2005, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Schuon and his wife emigrated to the United States, settling in [[Bloomington, Indiana]], where a community of disciples from all over the world would gather around him for spiritual direction. The first years in Bloomington saw the publication of some of his most important late works: ''From the Divine to the Human'', ''To Have a Center'', ''Survey of Metaphysics and Esoterism'' and others.

Apart from regular strictly Islamic Sufi gatherings of invocation (''majalis al-dhikr''), Schuon would occasionally lead in Bloomington gatherings involving the wearing of American Indian attire, and also some degree of ritual nudity.&lt;ref&gt; ''American Gurus: From Transcendentalism to New Age Religion'', Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 170. by Arthur Versluis.&lt;/ref&gt; These gatherings were understood by disciples as a sharing in Schuon's personal insights and realization, not as part of the initiatic method he transmitted, centered on the [[Japa|invocation of a Divine Name]].&lt;ref&gt;Aymard and Laude, ''Frithjof Schuon: Life and Teachings'', SUNY Press, NY, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 1991, one of Schuon's followers accused him of "fondling" three young girls during “primordial gatherings”. A preliminary investigation was begun, but the chief prosecutor eventually concluded that there was no proof, noting that the plaintiff was of extremely dubious character. The prosecutor declared that there were no grounds for prosecution, and the local press made amends.

==Views based on his written works==

===Transcendent unity of religions===
The traditionalist or ''perennialist'' perspective began to be enunciated in the 1920s by the French philosopher [[René Guénon]] and, in the 1930s, by Schuon himself. Orientalist [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] and Swiss art historian [[Titus Burckhardt]] also became prominent advocates of this point of view. Fundamentally, this doctrine is the [[Sanatana Dharma]] – the "eternal religion" – of [[Hindu]] [[Neo-Vedanta]].  It was supposedly formulated in ancient Greece, in particular, by [[Plato]] and later [[Neoplatonists]], and in Christendom by [[Meister Eckhart]] (in the West) and [[Gregory Palamas]] (in the East). Every religion has, besides its literal meaning, an [[esoteric]] dimension, which is essential, primordial and universal. This intellectual universality is one of the hallmarks of Schuon's works, and it gives rise to insights into not only the various spiritual traditions, but also history, science and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The dominant theme or principle of Schuon's writings was foreshadowed in his early encounter with a Black [[marabout]] who had accompanied some members of his [[Senegal]]ese village to [[Switzerland]] in order to demonstrate their culture. When the young Schuon talked with him, the venerable old man drew a circle with radii on the ground and explained: God is in the center; all paths lead to Him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Metaphysics===
For Schuon, the quintessence of pure metaphysics can be summarized by the following [[vedantic]] statement, although the [[Advaita Vedanta]]'s perspective finds its equivalent in the teachings of [[Ibn Arabi]], [[Meister Eckhart]] or [[Plotinus]]: ''Brahma satyam jagan mithya jivo brahmaiva na'parah'' (Brahman is real, the world is illusory, the self is not different from Brahman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-941532-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metaphysics exposited by Schuon is based on the doctrine of the non-dual Absolute (Beyond-Being) and the degrees of reality. The distinction between the Absolute and the relative corresponds for Schuon to the couple [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atma]]/[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. Maya is not only the cosmic illusion: from a higher standpoint, Maya is also the Infinite, the Divine Relativity or else the feminine aspect (''[[Adi Parashakti|mahashakti]]'') of the Supreme Principle.

Said differently, being the Absolute, Beyond-Being is also the Sovereign Good (''Agathon''), that by its nature ''desires'' to communicate itself through the projection of Maya. The whole manifestation from the first Being ([[Ishvara]]) to matter ([[Prakriti]]), the lower degree of reality, is indeed the projection of the Supreme Principle ([[Brahman]]). The personal God, considered as the creative cause of the world, is only ''relatively Absolute,'' a first determination of Beyond-Being, at the summit of Maya. The Supreme Principle is not only Beyond-Being. It is also the Supreme Self ([[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]) and in its innermost essence, the Intellect ([[buddhi]]) that is the ray of Consciousness shining down, the axial refraction of Atma within Maya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Spiritual path===
According to Schuon the spiritual path is essentially based on the discernment between the "Real" and the "unreal" ([[Atman (Hinduism)|Atma]] / [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]); concentration on the Real; and the practice of virtues.  Human beings must know the "Truth".  Knowing the Truth, they must then will the "Good" and concentrate on it.  These two aspects correspond to the metaphysical doctrine and the spiritual method.  Knowing the Truth and willing the Good, human beings must finally love "Beauty" in their own soul through virtue, but also in "Nature". In this respect Schuon has insisted on the importance for the authentic spiritual seeker to be aware of what he called the "metaphysical transparency of phenomena".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Schuon wrote about different aspects of  spiritual life both on the doctrinal and on the practical levels. He explained the forms of the spiritual practices as they have been manifested in various traditional universes. In particular, he wrote on the Invocation of the Divine Name ([[dhikr]], [[Japa]]-[[Yoga]], the Prayer of the Heart), considered by Hindus as the best and most providential means of realization at the end of the [[Kali Yuga]].  As has been noted by the Hindu saint [[Ramakrishna]], the secret of the invocatory path is that God and his Name are one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-941532-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schuon's views are in harmony with traditional Islamic teachings of the primacy of "Remembrance of God" as emphasized by Shaykh Al-Alawi in the following passage:
{{Quote
|text=Remembrance (dhikr) is the most important rule of the religion. The law was not imposed upon us nor the rites of worship ordained except for the sake of establishing the remembrance of God (dhikru ʾLlāh). The Prophet said: ‘The circumambulation (ṭawāf) around the Holy House, the passage to and fro between (the hills of) Safa and Marwa, and the throwing of the pebbles (on three pillars symbolizing the devil) were ordained only for the sake of the Remembrance of God.’ And God Himself has said (in the Koran): ‘Remember God at the Holy Monument.’ Thus we know that the rite that consists in stopping there was ordained for remembrance and not specifically for the sake of the monument itself, just as the halt at Muna was ordained for remembrance and not because of the valley. Furthermore He (God) has said on the subject of the ritual prayer: ‘Perform the prayer in remembrance of Me.’ In a word, our performance of the rites is considered ardent or lukewarm according to the degree of our remembrance of God while performing them. Thus when the Prophet was asked which spiritual strivers would receive the greatest reward, he replied: ‘Those who have remembered God most.’ And when asked which fasters would receive the greatest reward, he replied: ‘Those who have remembered God most.’ And when the prayer and the almsgiving and the pilgrimage and the charitable donations were mentioned, he said each time: ‘The richest in remembrance of God is the richest in reward.’&lt;ref&gt;(Shaykh Aḥmad al-ʿAlawī in his treatise Al-Qawl al-Maʿrūf)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Quintessential esoterism===
Guénon had pointed out at the beginning of the twentieth century that every religion comprises two main aspects, "[[esoterism]]" and "[[exoterism]]". Schuon explained that esoterism displays two aspects, one being an extension of exoterism and the other one independent of exoterism; for if it be true that the form "is" in a certain way the essence, the essence on the contrary is by no means totally expressed by a single form; the drop is water, but water is not the drop. This second aspect is called "quintessential esoterism" for it is not limited or expressed totally by one single form or theological school and, above all, by a particular religious form as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | id = 
  | isbn = 0-941532-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of modernity===
Guénon had based his ''Crisis of the Modern World'' on the Hindu doctrine of cyclic nature of time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CwUo8zcsinoC&amp;pg=PA8 ''The System of Antichrist: Truth and Falsehood in Postmodernism and the New Age'', Chapter: ''The Prophecy of René Guénon'', By Charles Upton, Sophia Perennis, 2005 - 88 pages, Pages 8 to 10]&lt;/ref&gt; Schuon expanded on this concept and its consequences for humanity in many of his articles.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, ''Critic of the modern World'', pages 46 à 50 , in ''The Essential Frithjof Schuon'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=_BdR766nkzoC&amp;pg=PA46]&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay "The Contradictions of Relativism", Schuon wrote that the uncompromising relativism that underlies many modern philosophies had fallen into an intrinsic absurdity in declaring that there is no absolute truth and then attempting to put this forward as an absolute truth. Schuon notes that the essence of relativism is found in the idea that we never escape from human subjectivity whilst its expounders seem to remain unaware of the fact that relativism is therefore also deprived of any objectivity. Schuon further notes that the Freudian assertion that rationality is merely a hypocritical guise for a repressed animal drive results in the very assertion itself being devoid of worth as it is itself a rational judgment.&lt;ref&gt;''Logic and transcendence'', Perennial Books, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibeipr.com.br/conteudo/academicos/misticaislamica.pdf ''A Mística Islâmica em Terræ Brasilis: o Sufismo e as Ordens Sufis em São Paulo''].

Rev Prof '''George Campbell''' [[Doctor of Divinity|DD]] [[FRSE]] (25 December 1719 – 6 April 1796) was a figure of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], known as a philosopher, [[minister of religion|minister]], and professor of [[divinity]]. Campbell was primarily interested in [[rhetoric]], since he believed that its study would enable his students to become better preachers. He became a philosopher of rhetoric because he took it that the philosophical changes of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] would have implications for rhetoric.

==Life, times, and influences==

Campbell was born on 25 December 1719 in [[Aberdeen]] (it is unlikely that there was much significance given to his birth date, since Scottish [[Calvinist]]s, such as Campbell's father, Rev. Colin Campbell, despised both [[popish]] rituals and holidays). At the age of fifteen, Campbell attended [[Marischal College]] where he studied [[logic]], metaphysics, pneumatology (philosophy of mind and/or spirit), ethics, and [[natural philosophy]]. After graduating with his M.A. in 1738, Campbell decided to study law and served as an apprentice to a [[writer to the Signet]] in Edinburgh. He began gravitating towards theology after attending lectures at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. After serving out his term as an apprentice, he returned to Aberdeen and enrolled at both [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's]] and [[Marischal College]]s, [[University of Aberdeen]] as a student of divinity. Because of the tumultuous political landscape in [[Scotland]] (see [[Jacobite rising of 1745]]), Campbell's divinity examinations were delayed until 1746 when he received his licence to preach. Within two years, he received ordination at the parish of [[Banchory]] Ternan.

The origin of Campbell's scholarly career can be traced back to his years at the parish. He established himself as a [[scripture]] critic, and lecturer of [[holy writ]]. Campbell began his lifelong ambition of translating the [[gospels]], and around 1750, he composed the first two chapters of ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric''. Campbell's growing reputation impressed the [[magistrate]]s of the city of Aberdeen and he was offered a ministerial position in 1757. His return brought him to the core of the growing intellectual community in northeast [[Scotland]]. In 1759, Campbell was offered the position of [[Principal (university)|principal]] at Marischal College and he fully immersed himself in university affairs.

During his time at Marischal, Campbell was a founding member of the [[Aberdeen Philosophical Society]] along with philosopher [[Thomas Reid]], [[John Gregory (moralist)|John Gregory]] (mediciner), [[David Skene]], [[Walking Stewart|John Stewart]] and [[Robert Trail]]. Many members of the Society, including Reid, Campbell, and Gregory, were great admirers of [[Francis Bacon]], so the group's aim directed toward the exploration of the sciences of the mind. The Aberdeen Philosophical Society is most often remembered for its philosophical publications, notably: Reid's ''Inquiry into the Human mind, on the Principles of Common Sense'' (1764), [[James Beattie (writer)|James Beattie]]'s ''Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth'' (1770), and [[Alexander Gerard]]' ''Essay on Genius''. Campbell's work was very much influenced by the group's members. ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric'' was originally read in discourses before this Society. Campbell's emphasis on the trustworthiness of the senses and his exploration of tendencies basic to human nature have been attributed to the influence of his colleague in the society, the [[common sense]] philosopher, Thomas Reid.

Campbell's first major publication, ''A Dissertation in Miracles'' (1762), was directed against [[David Hume]]'s attack on miracles in ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]''. Campbell was influenced by Hume, but took particular issue with his philosophical strictures. Even though both were in complete opposition over almost every point of philosophy, Campbell and Hume shared a mutual respect. Thanks in part to the success of ''Miracles'', Campbell became a professor of divinity at Marischal in 1770. He lectured to students to prepare them for the demands of the ministry, both practical and spiritual. Campbell gave lectures on [[Church history]], later published as ''Lectures on Ecclesiastical History'', and on pastoral character and preaching, later published as ''Lectures on Pulpit Eloquence''. After completing ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric'' (1776), Campbell published several sermons and finished his lifelong ambition, ''The Four Gospels, Translated from the Greek'' (1789).

In December 1793 he was a founder member of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell continued lecturing until ill health forced him into retirement in 1795 and he died on 6 April 1796. He is buried in St Nicholas Churchyard in Aberdeen.

==Legacy==

===Campbell as an enlightened thinker===

While Campbell's literary life was dominated by [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] and [[minister of religion|pastoral]] concerns, it is apparent that his mind was tempered by the values of the Enlightenment. Campbell believed that the Enlightenment was the ally to a [[Moderate Party (Scotland)|moderate]], rational, and practical Christianity, rather than a threat. His faith required that his religious evidences to be complete while his enlightened thinking required faith to give it purpose.

Throughout Campbell's literary career, he focused on enlightened concerns such as rhetoric, taste, and genius—perhaps a result of his time in the Aberdeen Philosophical Society. His attempt to align rhetoric within the sphere of psychology resulted from [[Francis Bacon]]'s survey of the structure and purpose of knowledge. The Philosophy of Rhetoric illustrates the Baconian influence of [[Inductive reasoning|inductive methodology]] but also scientific investigation—two major concerns of the Enlightenment.

As well, Campbell's appeal to natural evidences was a similarity in process shared by most of the great minds of the Enlightenment. This is seen throughout his writing, with particular emphasis on placing methodology before doctrine, critical inquiry before judgment, and his application of tolerance, moderation, and improvement.

===Campbell and faculty psychology===

Campbell embraced the philosophical empiricism which [[John Locke]] established in [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]. Following the example of Locke's humanistic sciences, Campbell set forth an analysis of rhetoric through the scope of mental faculties. He believed that a rhetoric grounded in [[empirical knowledge|empiricism]] would become efficient because of the incorporation of the [[cognition|cognitive processes]]. The human senses are the basis for the validity of belief; thus a [[rhetoric|rhetorical theory]] based in [[faculty psychology]] would establish that [[rhetoric]] is capable of making a reader experience a concept with the same "vivacity" and automaticity as that of the senses.

Campbell, like most theorists of the Enlightenment, believed in a [[natural philosophy|universal human nature]]: the "general principles [of taste] are the same in every people".&lt;ref&gt;Philosophy of Rhetoric, Harper, 1849 (1776), p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; He gives the example of [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]] and [[figures of speech|figuration]] which "are so far from being the inventions of art, that, on the contrary, they result from the original and essential principles of the human mind".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This facet of human nature has remained constant throughout history so it must be universal trait. Based on premises similar to this, Campbell claimed that human beings act according to clear and obvious motives and rhetoric should be, in turn, directed towards similar operations of the mind.

To persuade effectively, Campbell believed that the orator should adapt his or her discourse to the needs of the audience, for as he states: "whatever be the ultimate intention of the orator, to inform, to convince, to please, to move, or to persuade, still he must speak so as to be understood, or he speaks to no purpose".{{The Philosophy of Rhetoric, 216, Book II, Chapter IV}}  He classifies the needs of the audience into four different categories:

:*Understanding: Elucidating a subject by explanation and proof
:*Imagination: Exciting admiration by style, resemblance, detail, and sublimity
:*Passions: Involving, motivating, associating images
:*Will: Persuading to action by combining argumentation with vivacity

The purpose of discourse is derived from the powers of the mind to which they appeal (understanding, imagination, passions, will), rather than the classical three, which are based on the public purpose of oration. The classical categories (see [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]]) are the demonstrative, to praise or blame; the deliberative, to advise or dissuade; and the forensic, to accuse or defend. In considering each of these, Campbell believes that not only understanding and memory of the audience must be taken into account, but the orator must as well provide particular attention at stimulating their passions. To incorporate this was as an obvious concern for Campbell, who believed that effective [[sermon|preaching]] must be measured by its effects on the audience.

===Campbell and evidence===
To move an audience, Campbell believed that a rhetorician must appreciate the relationship between evidence and human nature. Campbell divided evidence into two major types: intuitive and deductive.

Intuitive evidence is convincing by its mere appearance. Its effect on the power of judgment is "natural, original, and unaccountable",{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} which suggests that no other additional evidences can make it more compelling or effective.  Campbell subdivides intuitive evidence into three sources: [[abstraction]], [[consciousness]], and [[common sense]]. These are responsible for our understanding of [[truth|metaphysical, physical, and moral truths]].

Deductive evidence, unlike intuitive, is not immediately perceived. It must be demonstrated either logically or factually since it is not derived by premises but with comparing ideas. Deductive evidence originates from one of two sources: demonstrative or moral. Demonstrative concerns itself with abstract and invariable relations of ideas; moral, on the other hand, is concerned only with matters of fact.

Campbell had the idea of both moral and scientific reasoning. In his book, ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric'', the philosopher states four types of evidence that goes into reasoning. The first one is that reasoning comes from experience and how past experiences shape our sense of reason for present, and future reasoning. The second type of evidence is analogy, to analyze a situation we are able to get more of an understanding and view what needs to be done in the future to better an outcome. The third type of evidence is testimony. Testimony has to deal with written or oral communication. The very last is calculations of chances. Knowing that chance is not predictable a person can assume and use reason when it comes to other certain types of happenings.

===Campbell's critique of Aristotle===

Campbell believed that [[Aristotle]]'s [[syllogism|syllogistic method]] is faulty for four reasons:

:# It is offered as a method of discovery when at best it is a way to present ideas;
:# Even in mathematics or as a method of presentation, it is not efficient or effective since its formal rules do not guarantee validity;
:# Even if it is only used as a method of reasoning, a syllogism is not very useful because it leads one to discover what is obvious from the first premise, because the syllogism will most likely assume the point in question;
:# Even if they will sometimes guard the mind against an oversight, syllogisms often also mislead and are hardly the most effective check against carelessness.

===Campbell and Hume===
In [[David Hume]]'s essay, ''[[Of Miracles]]'', he assesses the credibility of [[testimony]] for miracles, and claims that our acceptance of it is based on experience; thus when testimony goes against the evidence of experience, it is a likely reason to reject the testimony.

In response, Campbell published ''A Dissertation on Miracles'' to refute Hume's essay. He believed that Hume misrepresented the importance of testimony in attaining knowledge. Our faith in the representation of others is an original component in [[human nature]]. As proof, Campbell provides the example of children who readily accept the testimony of others. It is not until they get older and become sceptical that testimony is rejected; proof that our trust in witnesses precedes that of experience. For Campbell, the belief of testimony is part of [[human nature]], since it is an unlearned and automatic response. Testimony is thus closer to evidence from [[consciousness]] than that from experience.

Campbell argues that the most important factor in determining the authenticity of testimony is the number of witnesses. Numerous witnesses and no evidence of collusion will supersede all other factors, since the likelihood of testimony outweighs that of Hume's formula for determining the balance of probabilities. According to Campbell, Hume is wrong to claim that testimony is a weakened type of evidence; it is capable of providing absolute certainty even with the most miraculous event.

==Works==

===Writing===
* ''A Dissertation on Miracles'' (1762)
:A somewhat belated response to [[David Hume]]'s essay, ''[[Of Miracles]]'' (1748). Within the widely debated discussion on [[miracle]]s, Campbell establishes a relationship between [[reason]] and [[faith]]. He explains that a miracle is necessary to conversion, that miracles are important and should not be readily dismissed, and that the sceptical cannot reason their way to [[faith]].

* ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric''
**Book I: "The Nature and Foundations of Eloquence".  Campbell attempts to clarify the theoretical understanding of classical [[rhetoric]]. He draws upon [[empiricism|empiricist]] philosophy for deriving belief in the audience and on [[faculty psychology]] to establish the motives of the audience.
**Book II: "The Foundations and Essential Properties of Elocution".  A [[philosophy of language]] and prescriptions for its usage. Campbell argues for a standard usage of language; favouring national over local, present over past, and reputable sources over common.
**Book III: "The Discriminating Properties of Elocution".  Campbell's views on style and an analysis of vivacity.
* ''The Four Gospels'' (1789)
:Campbell regarded this as the greatest work of his life: a 1,500 page translation of the [[Four Gospels]]. Along with the translation, it includes critical dissertations on the problems of translating and interpreting the ancient texts, as well as his observations on the translations themselves.

===Sermons and lectures===
Campbell's [[sermon]]s and lectures provide important insights into the structure of his thought and range of his scholarly activities.

* "The Spirit of the Gospel: A Spirit neither of Superstition nor of Enthusiasm" (1771)
:Campbell attempts to defend the character of Christ against attacks from the outside the church and against the dangers of misguided Christians within. He argues, against the critics of religion, that true Christianity is not characterised by fearful [[superstition]] or by merciless indoctrination.

* "The Nature, Extent, and Importance of Duty of Allegiance" (1777)
:Argues that [[rebellion]] is unreasonable and without [[scripture|scriptural warrant]]. True [[liberty]] can only be found within the rule of law.

* "The Success of the First Publishers of the Gospel: A Proof of its Truth" (1777)
:Campbell argues that the situation of the world, during the early years of Christianity, was so utterly inhospitable that Christianity's success can only be explained by supernatural means.

* "The Happy Influence of Religion on Civil Society" (1779)
:Campbell argues that religion is necessary for civil order and happiness because it provides moral sanctions that political laws cannot.

* "An Address to the People of Scotland upon the Alarms that Have Been Raised in Regard to Popery" (1779)
:Campbell demonstrates, from both scripture and reason, that persecution in all its forms is both wrong and ineffective. He refuted claims that [[Catholicism|Catholics]] threatened national security and sought to overrun Britain.

* ''Lectures on Ecclesiastical History'' (Posthumous, 1800)
:The first part of Campbell's divinity course at Marischal College; they are topical arguments designed to illustrate certain historical tendencies in the development of the church. The lectures focus on the growth and domination of the hierarchical form of ecclesiastical government. There was nothing particularly new in Campbell's analysis, except his use of [[psychology|psychological]] explanations.

* ''Lectures on Systematic Theology and Pulpit Eloquence'' (posthumous, 1807)
:Campbell underlines a systematic [[methodology]] for studying scripture, the evidences of religion, and for forming a system of Christian morality. Their purpose was to prevent divinity students from accepting a fixed view of Christianity.

* ''Lectures on the Pastoral Character'' (Posthumous, 1811)
:Practical lectures which give advice to prospective ministers on particular [[virtue]]s to cultivate and [[vice]]s to avoid.

{{Campaignbox Black Power movement}}
The '''Glenville shootout''' was a gun battle which occurred on the night of July 23–24, 1968, in the [[Glenville, Cleveland|Glenville]] section of [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], in the United States. Gunfire was exchanged for roughly four hours between the [[Cleveland Division of Police|Cleveland Police Department]] and the Black Nationalists of New Libya, a [[Black Power]] group. The battle led to the death of three policemen, three suspects, and a bystander. At least 15 others (police, gunmen, and bystanders) were wounded.

The gun battle sparked the '''Glenville Riots''', which began on the evening of July 23 as the gun battle was winding down, and continued through the evening of July 26–27. During the first day of the riots, the [[African American]] [[List of mayors of Cleveland|mayor of Cleveland]], [[Carl Stokes]], refused to allow white police officers to patrol the area. When African American leaders in the neighborhood were unable to quell the violence, Stokes sent the [[Ohio Army National Guard]] and the rest of the Cleveland Police into the area to stop the violence. The riots ended early in the morning on July 27. Losses due to the riots were about $2.6 million, and proved to be the political death knell of Mayor Stokes' [[Cleveland: Now!]] redevelopment effort. The instigator of the gunfight, Ahmed Evans, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. His sentence was later commuted to life in prison.

The city of Cleveland suffered a significant loss of heavy industry beginning about 1950, which led to markedly higher unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industry|website=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History|date=July 17, 1997|accessdate=March 24, 2016|url=https://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=I4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, large numbers of [[African American]]s left the [[Deep South]] during the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]].{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=33}} Cleveland saw a significant influx of blacks (who mistakenly believed the city was still a source of good jobs), but racial segregation and racially discriminatory housing practices left most African Americans able to find housing only in the city's eastern neighborhoods.{{sfn|Zieger|2007|page=148}} The number of residents living there jumped from 150,000 in 1950 to 250,000 in 1960.{{sfn|Tittle|1992|page=119}} Among the changing areas was the [[Glenville, Cleveland|Glenville neighborhood]]. In 1950, Glenville was overwhelmingly white, middle-class, and [[Jew]]ish.{{sfn|Keating|1994|page=80}} As these residents began migrating into Cleveland's far eastern suburbs in the 1950s,{{Efn|[[Blockbusting]] greatly exacerbated this outmigration.{{sfn|Wiese|2005|page=251}} This is a tactic of unscrupulous real estate agents, who convince racist white property owners that minorities will soon be moving into the neighborhood. These realtors then purchase white-owned homes at low prices from whites desperate to sell, and resell the homes at much higher prices to minority families.{{sfn|Squires|2008|pages=179–180}}}} single-family homes were turned into rentals, and thousands of African Americans moved in. By 1960, Glenville was overwhelmingly black and poor.{{sfn|Keating|1994|page=80}} Most people in Glenville also lived in crowded, substandard housing. Quite often, single-family homes in Glenville were subdivided into four or more apartments, each of which accommodated a large, extended family.{{sfn|Miller|Wheeler|1997|pages=166–167}}

Racial tensions in Cleveland were exacerbated as the city began busing African American children to all-white schools in order to racially desegregate its schools and to reduce overcrowding in minority-majority elementary schools. Black parents were outraged when they discovered that their children were not eligible to participate in arts, sports, and after-hours activities at these schools.{{sfn|Tittle|1992|pages=119–120}} In January 1964, the [[United Freedom Movement]], a coalition of black civil rights groups, decided to march on the Murray Hill School in the city's [[University Circle#Little Italy|Little Italy]] neighborhood. When city leaders learned that local white residents intended to stop the march, they feared a riot would break out. The black civil rights groups were persuaded to cancel their protest. But the white mob still formed, and throughout the day on January 30, 1964, white citizens threw rocks and bottles and assaulted any African American person they found on the streets. The [[Cleveland Division of Police|Cleveland Police]] made no arrests.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=33}}

Cleveland's [[Black Power]] movement grew substantially in 1964 and 1965, as African American residents of the city viewed the Murray Hill riot as a symbol of their powerlessness. Despair bred extremism and violence. White and black [[gang]]s formed in the adjacent [[St. Clair-Superior|Superior-Sowinski]] area just east of Glenville, and physical assaults and gang wars occurred in broad daylight in the spring and summer of 1966.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=35–36}} In June 1966, the week-long [[Hough Riots]] occurred throughout much of northeast Cleveland.{{sfn|Williams|2007|pages=127–130}} Racial tension in the city worsened in the aftermath of these riots. A number of [[arson]]ists burned buildings and several stores were looted in the [[Hough, Cleveland|Hough]] neighborhood (the center of the riot) during the spring of 1967.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=38}} Although many in the local and national media believed Cleveland was headed for another summer of violence in 1967, local African American anger appeared to be channeled politically instead. African American state legislator [[Carl Stokes]] unseated incumbent (and white) mayor [[Ralph S. Locher]] in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] primary, and went on to win the mayoralty against white [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] attorney [[Seth Taft]] in November 1967.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=38–39}}

==Radicalization of Ahmed Evans==
Fred Evans was born in [[Greenville, South Carolina]] in 1931. His family moved to Cleveland in 1943. Evans dropped out of high school and enlisted in the [[United States Army]] in 1948. He served in the [[Korean War]], where he won several medals for meritorious service. After suffering a severe injury when a bridge he was helping to build collapsed, he was discharged in 1952. He drove a city bus for two years, then reenlisted in 1954. He struck an officer, was [[court-martial]]ed, and was sentenced to two years' hard labor and a [[Military discharge#Dishonorable|dishonorable discharge]]. His sentence was later reduced to [[Military discharge#Other Than Honorable (OTH)|undesirable discharge]], and he left the Army after just seven months.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=40}} Army physicians had concluded that his 1952 injuries had left him with [[migraine]]s, partial disability, [[epilepsy]], and a personality disorder. He now suffered from severe rage issues which (under stress) he was unable to control, and that this, in part, had led to his confrontation with the senior officer. Evans returned to Cleveland and worked as a menial laborer for the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=41}}

After seeing what he believed to be a [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] in the early 1960s, Evans turned to [[astrology]] for spiritual guidance. After his astrological mentor was hospitalized for insanity in 1966, Evans adopted the first name Ahmed, began wearing garments of an African design, and began preaching an increasingly militant form of [[black nationalism]].{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=41}} About 1964 or 1965, he joined a group calling itself the Black Nationalists of New Libya.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=44}}{{sfn|Tittle|1992|page=172}}{{Efn|Some sources call the group the "Republic of New Libya",{{sfn|Moore|2002|page=79}}{{sfn|Williams|2015|page=174}} but Evans himself used the term "Black Nationalists of New Libya".{{sfn|Colburn|Adler|2001|page=96}}}}{{Efn|Evans and other sources make it clear that the New Libya group formed before Evans joined it and became its leader.{{sfn|Williams|2015|page=174}}{{sfn|Colburn|Adler|2001|page=96}}}} He opened the Afro Culture Shop and Bookstore on Superior Avenue, which drew the attention of local police because it often served as a gathering place for young black militants. The police closed his store three times in 1967 for "sanitary violations" (actions which Evans felt were a ruse to harass him), and Evans assaulted African American Patrolman James Payne in April 1967.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=40}} In March 1967, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Evans had predicted that the United States would be consumed with violence on May 9, 1967. Although the media ridiculed Evans after his prediction failed to come to pass, Evans' status among local African Americans soared.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=41}}

On May 1, 1968, Mayor Stokes announced that he was forming a $10.5 billion fund, named [[Cleveland: Now!]], to completely redevelop the city of Cleveland within a decade. Money for the effort would be contributed by business, private foundations, the city, the state, and the federal government. Cleveland: Now! focused on job training, neighborhood and housing rehabilitation, education, youth development, health, welfare reform, and downtown revitalization.{{sfn|Tittle|1992|pages=168–169}} A significant number of grants were made immediately available to a wide range of neighborhood groups to help build civic pride, reduce racial tension, help end poverty, and for other aims. Ahmed Evans applied for and received a $10,300 grant from the city to help local youth learn African arts and crafts.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=41}}

==Rumors of an uprising, and police surveillance==
[[File:Glenville shootout aerial map.jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph of the area where the Glenville shootout occurred, showing the location of surveillance vehicles and the tow truck.]]
At 2:30 PM on July 22, 1968, [[Cleveland City Council]] member [[George L. Forbes]] and Mayor's Council on Youth Opportunities director [[Walter Beach]] met with Cleveland Police Inspector Lewis Coffey at [[Cleveland City Hall]]. Coffey said that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) had given the Cleveland police information that Ahmed Evans and his New Libya group were stockpiling weapons at Evans' home at 12312 Auburndale Avenue{{Efn|The house had been subdivided into apartments, and Evans was staying in one of these apartments.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=57, fn. 3}}}} in Glenville in preparation for assassinating several prominent African Americans (including Mayor Stokes) and instigating a general "uprising" on July 24.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=44}} The police expressed doubt about these reports, as the sole source of information was a paid FBI informer who was not a member of Evans' group and who seemed under the influence of illegal narcotics. However, police subsequently discovered that black nationalists had been seen at a local department store the morning of July 22 inquiring about high-powered rifles and purchasing [[bandolier]]s of ammunition and [[first aid]] kits at an [[Military surplus|army surplus]] store. But it was unclear if these men belonged to Evans' group.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=45}}{{Efn|At trial, the prosecution was able to establish that Evans and his group had purchased a number of weapons on July 22.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=57, fn. 2}}}} Furthermore, Evans was angry.  He had just been told by his white landlord that he could no longer rent space for his Afro Culture Shop and Bookstore,{{Efn|The structure had no toilets and a nonfunctional furnace, and Evans had already made repairs to the structure. The elderly woman who owned the building estimated it would take $1,000 to make the necessary repairs to pass a building inspection, and she did not want to invest that money because she was attempting to sell the structure. When notified of his eviction, Evans continued to make repairs despite the woman's pleas.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=57, fn. 3}}}} and he had been served with an eviction notice to vacate his apartment on the morning of July 22.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=46}}{{Efn|The apartment was not legally his to occupy.  It had been rented by a 16-year-old boy named Leslie Jackson (also known as Osu Bey).{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=46, 53}} Jackson was six weeks behind on his rent when his landlord began eviction proceedings against him on June 15. Jackson had also permitted as many as 16 to 20 people to sleep in the apartment each night, a violation of city housing regulations.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=57, fn. 3}}}}

At the meeting with Forbes and Beach, the police decided that a "roving surveillance" of Evans' home should be implemented.{{Efn|"Stationary surveillance" is when uniformed or plainclothes police sit in a stationary vehicle and watch a home or business.  Because the streets near Evan's home were narrow, any parked car would draw attention. Furthermore, there were few African Americans on the Cleveland Police force, which meant that white officers would have to be part of the surveillance team. White men in a parked car would draw too much attention. It was also known that Evans sometimes sent out patrols of one to three men around his neighborhood, looking for police surveillance.  A "roving surveillance", in which plainclothes police in automobiles moved in and out of the area without stopping, would draw much less attention but be just as effective.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=45}}}} Forbes and Beach also agreed to speak with Evans in an attempt to calm him down and attempt to address his grievances.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=47}}

At 6:00 PM on July 23, Forbes and Beach drove to the Afro Culture Shop and Bookstore{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=47}} at 11105 Superior Avenue{{sfn|Keegan|1971|page=324}} to see Evans. Not finding him there, they drove to the Evans' apartment at 12312 Auburndale Avenue and were surprised to discover that the Cleveland Police had, in fact, established a stationary surveillance around Evans' home. One unmarked car with white officers sat on Lakeview Avenue between Moulton and Auburndale,{{Efn|It is unclear where this vehicle was stationed. At one point, the official report says the vehicle was at Moulton and Lakeview,{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=47}} while at another point it says it was closer to the house at Lakeview and Auburndale.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=46}} The two locations are less than {{convert|75|ft|m}} apart.}} and another with white officers sat at the intersection of Auburndale and E. 124th Street.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=46}} At 7:50 PM, Forbes and Beach arrived at Evans' home. They talked with him for 15 minutes,{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=44}} during which time Evans expressed his anxiety about the police and his concern that he was going to be harassed again.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=46}} Forbes attempted to have the stationary surveillance removed, but was advised by the city's Safety Director,{{Efn|The Director of Public Safety, also known as the Safety Director, is a cabinet-level officer who oversees the Cleveland Department of Public Safety.  The Department of Public Safety includes divisions of animal control, emergency medical services, firefighting, emergency management, the city jail, and the city police.}} James McManamon, to speak with Mayor Stokes. Forbes reached Stokes, but Stokes was interrupted by another call and asked Forbes to call back in 15 minutes. During this time, Forbes drove to the home of Harllel Jones, an Evans associate. While speaking with Jones, they learned that the shootout had begun.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=46–47}}

==The shootout==
It is not clear whether the police or the Black Nationalists of New Libya opened fire first.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;{{sfn|Tittle|1992|page=173}} However, most press outlets stated that the Black Nationalists of New Libya initiated the gun battle.{{sfn|Parker|1974|page=49}}

===Shots at the Evans house===
According to police, shortly after Forbes and Beach left at 8:05 PM, an African American man with a carbine emerged from the Evans house and stood guard. A few minutes later, Evans and about 16 others, all of them heavily armed and wearing crossed bandoliers of ammunition, emerged from the house. The guard crossed the street and aimed his gun at the unmarked police vehicle sitting at Auburndale and E. 124th Street. The surveillants radioed for instructions, and at 8:20 PM were told to flee the area. The police vehicle turned right onto E. 124th Street, followed by a [[station wagon]]. The police claimed they heard a shot. The other police vehicle also fled the scene, turning right (south) onto Lakeview Avenue. The police in this car also said they heard several shots.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=47}}

Cleveland Police Car No. 604 (a marked vehicle then at E. 123rd Street and Beulah Avenue) broadcast a report of shots fired at 8:24 PM.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=49}}

A radio broadcast over the police radio alerted the second surveillance vehicle to the shots fired at the tow truck. It turned back, traveling east on Beulah. When it came within view of the tow truck, police say, they saw the tow truck driver running from an armed man. Then two snipers behind the tow truck fired on the unmarked police car (hitting its hood, grill, and windshield). The police returned fire, emptying their weapon ammunition magazines. The police vehicle then fled north on E. 123rd Street, all four of its tires shot out.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=47–48}}

===Attack on the tow truck===
[[File:Look W down Beulah St to Lakeview Road - Glenville Cleveland Ohio.jpg|thumb|View of Beulah Avenue. The photographer was standing about where the abandoned vehicle was. The intersection in the distance is Beulah and Lakeview, where the four gunmen stood and suspect Leroy Harrison died. A power substation stands where 1391 and 1395 Lakeview once stood. The "alley" down which the gunmen fled is still visible.]]
Around noon on July 23, 1968, a call was made to the Cleveland Police reporting an abandoned vehicle on Beulah Avenue between E. 123rd Street and Lakeview Road.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=43}}{{Efn|The car belonged to Henry R. Leftwich, who had loaned it to a friend several weeks earlier while Leftwich underwent long-term treatment for a back injury. The car broke down on Beulah Avenue on July 6, and Leftwich had done nothing to remove it.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=48}}}} The location was just a block north of Evans' home (at the intersection of Auburndale Avenue and Lakeview).{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=44}} The vehicle was ticketed at 1:25 PM, but a [[tow truck]] did not arrive until dusk.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=43}} It parked on the north side of Beulah Avenue near the intersection with Lakeview Road.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=50}} According to tow truck worker William McMillan,{{Efn|Tow truck workers are civilians, not police.  But they wore Army-like jackets which local Cleveland residents often mistook for police uniforms.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=43}}}} the truck backed up to the abandoned car, and then McMillan got out. He was checking the license plate of the automobile a few moments later when a man with a [[shotgun]] standing at the corner of Beulah and Lakeview shot him in the back.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=49}} An official chronology later placed the attack on McMillan at 8:25 PM.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=56}} Another man hiding in the bushes near the front of the truck fired, and shot McMillan in the side. McMillan's coworker, still in the truck, radioed for help{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=43}} at 8:28 PM.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=49}} According to McMillan, Ahmed Evans—armed with a carbine—walked on the sidewalk across the street and demanded to know if he was stealing cars. McMillan stood and said he had no weapons. He ran toward and then north up E. 123rd Street, and (he said) Evans shot him in the right side. An African American woman on E. 123rd Street gave refuge to McMillan.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=44}}

Eyewitness testimony conflicted with some of these events. Residents on the street and others said that the two tow truck operators examined the abandoned vehicle for several minutes before shots were fired, contradicting McMillan's testimony that he was fired upon almost immediately after exiting the cab of his truck. Some residents also said that an African American man approached the tow truck operators and argued with them briefly before departing.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=48}}

The federal government's official report on the Glenville shootout suggested that the tow truck was not a target of the New Libyans. Rather, it was "inadvertently trapped in the crossfire between police and snipers."{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=49}}

Evans later asserted that the tow truck was a ruse. He claimed police [[sniper]]s were already in the area and targeting him and his followers for assassination. These snipers fired on Evans and his followers first, he said.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=44}} He claimed he was nowhere near the tow truck when shots were fired.  Instead, he said, he had left his home and was walking on west on Auburndale Avenue toward the Lakeview Tavern (a few feet around the corner to the south) when he heard shots "coming from the end of the street". A man ran past him. Evans said he ran north to Beulah in time to see the tow truck operator running toward E. 123rd Street. He said he heard [[submachine gun]] fire, and said he assumed this was the blast which killed Leroy Mansfield Williams.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=49}}{{Efn|One eyewitness, who observed Evans walking up the west side of Lakeview Road toward Beulah Street, claimed that Evans was calm and collected as he did so.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=49}}}}{{Efn|Mansfield was later retrieved by friends and taken to Huron Road Hospital. He arrived at 9:25 PM, and was pronounced dead.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=57–58, fn. 5}}}} Evans admitted that he fired several shots from his carbine, but the weapon then jammed.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=49}} He fled into the home at 1384 Lakeview Road.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=56, 59 fn. 10}}

===The shootout===
Several clearly-marked Cleveland Police cars arrived at the scene of the tow truck shooting about the same time that the second unmarked surveillance vehicle arrived. Police witnesses said that three men now stood on the two corners of Lakeview Road and Beulah Avenue, firing at the police cars. A fourth man—probably{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=49}} Leroy Mansfield Williams (also known as Amir Iber Katir){{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=49, 56}}—lay dying on the sidewalk.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=48}} Later estimates placed the time of his death at about 9:26 PM.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=56}}

Most of the Glenville shootout occurred between 8:30 and 9:30 PM. It was contained in a small area, barely {{convert|300|yd|m}} long, on Lakeview Road between Beulah Avenue and Auburndale Avenue. Lakeview Avenue is lined with residential homes, with narrow passages between them. When the police broadcast for assistance was made at 8:30 PM, it was an "all units" broadcast—which allowed any available police vehicle to respond. Within minutes, the side streets were clogged with police cars, abandoned there as officers arrived at the scene and ran on foot to the firefight. The police response was chaotic: Officers grabbed whatever weapon they could, and raced to the scene. Nearly all abandoned their radios in their vehicles. There was no law enforcement leadership present to control the police response.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=50}} Gunfire centered around four locations:  The tow truck, adjoining houses at 1391 and 1395 Lakeview Road, the Lakeview Tavern, and Ahmed Evans' apartment house at 12312 Auburndale Avenue.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=56}}

Three marked Cleveland Police vehicles were the first to arrive on the scene at 8:30 PM, one on Beulah Avenue and two at the intersection of Auburndale Avenue and Lakeview Road. Patrolmen Kenneth Gibbons and Willard Wolff were the first to arrive at the intersection of Lakeview and Auburndale,{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=51}} at 8:30 PM.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=56}} They claim to have observed a plainclothes police officer grappling with a young African American male in or near the front yard of the Evans home. As they exited their vehicle to assist, a rifle bullet struck the engine of their marked police vehicle.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=51}} It exploded, killing Wolff{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=51}}&lt;ref name=ripleycharged /&gt; and severely injuring Gibbons. Police Sergeants Sam Levy and Bill Moran arrived moments behind Gibbons and Wolff.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=51}} They ran behind the duplexes at 1435 and 1439 Lakeview Road, and used the alley to get behind the Lakeview Tavern. They then moved down the driveway between the tavern and the Evans home to reach Auburndale Avenue. At this point, Moran was shot and dived behind a car parked on the street, where he was shot again. Levy found safety under the car.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=52}}

Patrolmen Joseph McMannamon and Chester Szukalski were among the first uniformed officers to arrive at Beulah Avenue, approaching from the south on E. 123rd Street.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=50}} The time of their arrival has been estimated as 8:30 PM.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=56}} As they pulled in front of the tow truck, gunfire struck their vehicle from the south.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=50}} As the men tried to escape out the driver's side door, Szukalski was hit. Severely injured, he crawled about {{convert|30|to|40|ft|m}} toward a home and waited for help. McMannamon was lightly injured by bullet fragments. As more marked police cars arrived, the gunmen{{Efn|According to the testimony of police and tow truck driver McMillan, there were two groups of suspects: One or more gunmen on the south side of Beulah Avenue (who had shot at McMannamon and Szukalski) formed the first group, and four gunmen at the intersection of Lakeview and Beulah formed the second group.}} ran east—moving across Lakeview Road into a narrow alley that is something of an extension of Beulah Avenue. As the gunmen fled, they exchanged gunfire with other police who had just arrived, then turned south down the alley to get behind 1395 Lakeview Road.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=51}} Sources differ as to what happened next. Cleveland police claim the gunmen burst into the house, and occupied the second floor. Mrs. Beatrice Flagg and her children, living in the apartment on the first floor, fell to the ground to avoid being hit when police fired into the building. As the police pumped [[tear gas]] canisters into the home, the family fled. The police also claimed that the gunmen surprised Rev. Henry L. Perryman's wife, who fled with their nine-month-old son as the armed men seized her second-floor apartment. The police then occupied the first floor of 1391 Lakeview Road to use it as a base from which they could fire at the gunmen at 1395 Lakeview.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=51}} But Mrs. Perryman denied that any gunmen burst in on her. She and Mrs. Flagg claimed they received no warning before police began firing guns at their homes and launching tear gas through the windows.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=58, fn. 7}} A later press report gave a third version of events, saying the police ordered the apartments evacuated. After the Flaggs and Perrymans fled, the gunmen burst into the building and occupied the second floor.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=58, fn. 7}}

At 8:35 PM,{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=56}} Patrolman Louis E. Golonka, attempting to navigate the narrow passage between 1391 and 1395 Lakeview, was shot and killed.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=51}}&lt;ref name=ripleycharged /&gt; Five minutes later,{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=56}} police, firing into the alley from the rear windows of 1391 Lakeview, killed Sidney Curtis Taylor (also known as Malik Ali Bey).{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=51}} At 8:45 PM,{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=56}} Bernard Donald (also known as Nondu Bey) stood up out of some bushes behind 1395 Lakeview and fired at police in the passage between 1391 and 1395 Lakeview.

Lt. Leroy C. Jones and his partner arrived at the scene at about 8:40 PM, driving south on E. 124th Street. They parked and Jones ran around the corner onto Auburndale Avenue.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=52}} Heavy gunfire rang out, and Jones fell dead in the middle of the block{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=52}}&lt;ref name=ripleycharged /&gt; at 8:45 PM,{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=57}} lying on the sidewalk on the north side of the street. Patrolmen Angelo Santa Maria and Steve Sopko approached the scene from Auburndale Avenue about the time Jones died, but the number of abandoned police vehicles force them to park two blocks away.  Santa Maria ran behind the houses on the south side of Auburndale Avenue and spotted Jones lying on the sidewalk. Shouting to police hiding behind various types of cover on the north side of the street, he learned that it was Lt. Jones. Santa Maria asked for a volunteer among the many African American bystanders to drive a car along Auburndale, providing him with cover so he could retrieve Jones.  Twenty-two year old clerk James E. Chapman agreed to help. According to a federal government report, Chapman's car could not get close enough to Jones due the large number of abandoned police and civilian vehicles on Auburndale.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=52}}{{Efn|In a 2010 interview, Santa Maria said that the reason why he asked for a civilian's help was that he believed the gunmen would not shoot at a vehicle driven by an African American.

Lt. Elmer Joseph drove north on Lakeview Road and reached the intersection of Lakeview and Auburndale at 8:45 PM,{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=57}} about the time Moran and Levy came under fire. He was shot as he exited his vehicle, but managed to get to cover.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=52}} Fifty-year-old resident Henry Orange was wounded by gunfire at about the same location and same time, as was Patrolman Richard Hart.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=52, 57}} Hart fell in the street on Auburndale, and was shot several more times by a sniper standing in a dark doorway.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=52}}

Patrolman Leonard Szalkiewicz was shot and wounded at 8:55 PM{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=57}} while attempting to push an abandoned police vehicle off the street on Lakeview Road.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=53}}

Sometime around 9:15 PM, police officers burst into the Lakeview Tavern and ordered the 10 staff and customers to lie on the floor. More police burst into the bar, and forced the seven men and three women into the basement. The officers fired repeatedly into the ceiling, and shot tear gas into the basement before locking the staff and customers in. Eyewitnesses said John Pegues, a tavern patron, was shot in the leg by police at this time,{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=58, fn. 8 and fn. 9}} which an official chronology later said occurred at 9:30 PM.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=53, 57}} Patrolman Anthony Sherbinski, who rushed to the second floor to fire at snipers from the second floor window, was shot and wounded by return fire at the same time.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=53, 57}} The bar staff and patrons were not released from the basement until 10:15 PM. All the individuals were roughly handled by police, with most of the men being [[Pistol-whipping|pistol-whipped]]. All ten were taken to the Fifth District Police station and locked up. Pegues was not given medical attention until 5:00 AM.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=58, fn. 8 and fn. 9}}

At about 9:30 PM,{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=57}} Patrolmen Thomas Smith and Ernest Rowell attempted to help Sgt. Sam Levy, who was pinned down by sniper fire near the car where he'd first been shot. Both men were shot and wounded trying to pick him up. About an hour later, another police officer accidentally set off a tear gas grenade nearby.  Under cover of the cloud, Patrolmen William Traine and James Herron rushed with wheeled stretchers to retrieve Levy and Smith.  Other police also helped, and the two were wheeled to a nearby ambulance.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=53}}

By 9:45 PM, the shooting on Auburndale Avenue had ended.  News media reported that 17 men and women were arrested at 12312 and 12314 Auburndale Avenue, but Evans was not among them. No dead or wounded were found in either house, and only four rifles.  A fifth rifle was retrieved from a nearby automobile.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=53}} Police initially charged only three people: John Hardrick, age 17; Leslie Jackson (also known as Osu Bey), age 16; and Alfred Thomas, age 18, all of whom were found at 12314 Auburndale (the home next to the Evans house).{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=53–54}} All three admitted to having fired their rifles.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=54}}

The gun battle raging around 1395 Lakeview Road continued, however. Gunmen fired wildly in all directions from the upper floor windows. According to police, at one point a gunman stepped out of the house into the narrow passageway between 1395 and 1391 Lakeview, fired a few random shots, and went back inside. When he appeared at a kitchen window a few minutes later, police shot and apparently killed him (ending gunfire from the first floor of the structure).{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=54}}

At 11:11 PM, a police dispatcher advised all police in the area that a man at 1384 Lakeview Road wished to surrender to African American police. No one responded.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=56}}

About midnight, the police stormed 1395 Lakeview Road. They were able to get inside, but a locked and barricaded door prevented them from reaching the second floor. Police also say they saw a body lying on the kitchen floor. Shortly afterward, the house caught fire. The cause of the fire was never determined, and the [[Cleveland Division of Fire|Cleveland Fire Department]] did not fight the blaze since it was believed firefighters would come under attack. Police observers later said they heard the names "Omar" and "Ali" shouted from within the home. 1391 Lakeview Road also caught fire, and both homes burned to the ground.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=54}}

As the fires raged, Councilman Forbes, youth director Beach, Harllel Jones, and others had gathered to try to talk to the gunmen and bring calm to the neighborhood. Jones, wanting to ensure no one was caught inside the burning buildings, went behind the structures and retrieved the bodies of Sidney Curtis Taylor and Bernard Donald, as well as Donald's wounded brother, Lathan Donald (also known as Nondu-El).{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=55}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mellow|first=Theodore J.|title=Blacktown Is Heard|work=The Plain Dealer|date=September 5, 1971|page=E12|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Whelan|first=Edward P.|title='Reticent...Polite,' Teacher Remembers Lathan Donald|work=The Plain Dealer|date=August 19, 1969|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|Evans considered Lathan Donald his primary assistant in the New Libya group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whelan|first=Edward P.|title=Evans Testifies He Rejects U.S. Laws|work=The Plain Dealer|date=July 29, 1969|pages=A1, A7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to Jones and his two companions, two uniformed white policemen (their badges removed) beat them in the passageway, telling them "Leave that nigger to die".{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=55}}

At 12:24 AM on July 24, a police dispatcher again issued a broadcast that a man at 1384 Lakeview Road wished to surrender to black officers. Three white policemen went to the home. The man identified himself as Ahmed Evans, and peacefully surrendered. The 11:11 PM and 12:24 AM police broadcasts were the only time 1384 Lakeview had been mentioned by any police officer over the radio during the evening. Evans was unarmed when apprehended. His jammed carbine was found in the bushes in front of the building where he was found.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=56}}

No bodies were ever found inside either 1391 or 1395 Lakeview Road.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=56}}

In addition to the seven deaths, 15 people (police, New Libyans, and bystanders) were injured in the shootout.{{sfn|Tittle|1992|pages=171–173}} It is possible that many more injured people (including gunmen) never sought treatment for their injuries and thus never were recorded on the official casualty lists.

==The Glenville Riots==
===Night of July 23–24===
[[File:Looted and burned in 1968 Glenville riots.jpg|thumb|center|700px|Businesses looted (in black) and looted as well as burned (in red with slash) along Superior Avenue between E. 100th and E. 25th Streets during the first night of the Glenville riots.]]
Crowds began to gather on Superior Avenue almost as soon as the shooting started. Superior Avenue is a major city thoroughfare which also carries [[U.S. Route 6 in Ohio|U.S. Route 6]]. As police vehicles began racing down Superior Avenue to reach E. 120th Street, E. 123rd Street, Lakeview Road, and E. 124th Street, the crowd began throwing rocks at police and jeering them.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=61}} At 9:15 PM, Mayor Stokes called Ohio Governor [[Jim Rhodes]] to inform him that a riot in Cleveland was likely.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=65}} The governor called Major General Sylvester Del Corso, Adjutant General of the Ohio Army National Guard, and had the National Guard placed on alert.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=65–66}} By 9:30 PM, the crowd numbered close to a thousand, mostly young adult, teenage, and pre-adolescent African American males. About this time, the Glenville riots broke out. A [[Molotov cocktail]] hit a marked police vehicle, causing it to burst into flames. A commercial [[panel truck]], driving down Superior Avenue, was stopped by the crowd, the white driver brutally beaten, and the truck overturned and set afire. A black Cleveland Police officer, Herbert Reed, was pulled from his vehicle and savagely beaten. Two television news vehicles were also set aflame.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=61}}

Mayor Stokes went on television to inform the public about the shootout and potential riot. He taped a brief message at [[WKYC]]-TV, telling people about the gunfight, and asking them to stay out of the area and remain at home. The mayor's message was broadcast shortly before 11:00 PM on all local television stations. Most Clevelanders learned of the incident after the mayor's message interrupted a baseball game between the [[Cleveland Indians]] and the [[Baltimore Orioles]].{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=66}}

As they had done during the Hough riots, Cleveland Police withdrew from the area and formed a perimeter cordon. The mob moved west almost {{convert|1|mi|km}} along Superior Avenue, looting stores. An entire block of buildings at E. 105th and Superior burned to the ground. The rioters also moved {{convert|1|mi|km}} north, reaching St. Clair Avenue.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=61}} Small bands of rioters and arsonists even moved into Hough as far west as E. 55th Street.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=62}}

About midnight, Mayor Stokes formally requested National Guard assistance in quelling the riot.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=66}} More than 4,000 Guardsmen were mobilized, and 1,500 were sent to Cleveland that night.&lt;ref name=ripleyarea&gt;{{cite news|last=Ripley|first=Anthony|title=Area Where 10 Died Is Calm After Guardsmen Withdraw|work=The New York Times|date=July 25, 1968|pages=1, 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the early morning of July 24, area firefighters attempted to respond to blazes, but were pelted with rocks and bottles. They then stopped responding unless given a police escort. During the night, fire departments responded to 15 fires set by vandals, as well as several false alarms and a handful of non-riot related fires.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=68, fn. 1}}{{Efn|The Cleveland Fire Department contested this official count of the fires.  It claimed the local fire departments had responded to 50 to 60 fires, most of them on Superior Avenue. Twenty of these were considered "major" fires, involving one or more buildings.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=62}}}} At 3:00 AM,{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=66}} about 200 Ohio Army National Guardsmen,&lt;ref name=ripleyarea /&gt; assisted by 24 Cleveland Police officers, began patrolling Glenville.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=66–67}}{{Efn|There were three Guardsmen and one Cleveland Police officer to a [[Jeep]]. All reports of looting or gunfire were reported directly to the National Guard, and the Guard and police were instructed to arrest rioters without using deadly force.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=67}}}}

During the night, 28 African Americans were arrested, three-quarters of them for looting.  According to eyewitnesses, about midnight, two white men in an automobile shot at three young black men waiting for a bus at E. 79th Street and St. Clair Avenue.  Twenty-two-year-old Clifford Miller was hit in the head, and died.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=62}} Thirty-year-old African American security guard James C. Haynes was found dead from multiple shotgun wounds behind a building at 8203 Superior Avenue shortly after midnight. He may have been killed by police.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=63}}{{Efn|Haynes guarded an apartment building at 1270 E. 83rd Street. He'd confronted a group of African American youth who tried to gain entry to his building, firing a warning shot in the air with his pistol. The youth dispersed. Police radios broadcast two reports: One at 11:45 PM of two officers trapped in a burning building at E. 82nd and Superior, another at 11:50 PM of two officers pinned down by snipers at a building at E. 82nd and Superior. The source of these reports was never identified. Several marked police vehicles raced to the Afro Set headquarters at 8127 Superior Avenue (between E. 82nd and E. 83rd Streets). Cleveland Law Director Clarence L. "Buddy" James, Jr. (the top legal officer for the city) had been on the scene of the Glenville shootout since about 9:00 PM. He had stationed an African American patrolman at the Afro Set office to help calm militants meeting there.  According to eyewitnesses, police in Car 351 arrived at a gas station at the corner of Superior and E. 83rd Street and began shooting without provocation at Haynes' apartment building {{convert|100|ft|m}} or so to the north.  Another police car drove down the alley behind 1270 E. 83rd (the alley where Haynes was found dead). James, arriving at the scene moments later, claimed that the police in Car 351 refused to obey his orders to remain on site and attempted to flee the scene. James says he followed in another police vehicle, alternately and repeatedly using a bullhorn and the police radio in an attempt to make Car 351 come to a halt. James later said that when he finally was able to stop Car 351, it was running without its headlights on.  The officers in Car 351 denied that they had done any shooting, even though shells from their weapons littered the ground and the apartment building at 1270 E. 83rd Street was riddled with holes from police gunfire. Eyewitnesses and James have implied that the police shot Haynes. Despite a promise from the Cleveland Police Department, no investigation appears to have been made of this incident.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=63–65}}}}

===July 24===
At 8:30 AM on July 24, Stokes met with 100 African American civic leaders at City Hall to discuss ways to prevent the violence from flaring up again. Although no consensus for action emerged, most of the attendees felt that continued police presence would merely inflame tensions, and a few felt that a curfew would do little except build resentment while not preventing outsiders from coming into the area to make trouble.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=67}} Early in the afternoon, a group of about 20 African American civic leaders (most, but not all, militants) suggested to Stokes that the black community be allowed to try to quell the violence on their own. A similar strategy had been proposed by a handful of black leaders during the night and at the 8:30 AM morning. At a meeting with Councilman Forbes and others held about 3:00 PM, Stokes discussed this plan. There was general agreement to try it, although General Del Corso was skeptical that it would succeed.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=68}}

During the day, there were scattered reports of looting and the hawking of stolen goods, to which Cleveland police responded. Although a temporary ban on the sale of liquor had been imposed throughout Cuyahoga County some time during the night, a few bars in the cordoned area were fined and closed for violating the ban.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=71}}

At 4:15 PM, Stokes announced his plan for handling the riots. The area encompassed by Euclid Avenue, E. 55th Street, Superior Avenue, Rockefeller Park, St. Clair Avenue, and the Cleveland-[[East Cleveland, Ohio|East Cleveland]] border would be cordoned off at 7:00 PM.  The National Guard and a unit of police officers would patrol the perimeter.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=68}}&lt;ref name=ripleyarea /&gt; A normal police patrol,{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=68}} consisting of 125 African American patrolmen,&lt;ref name=ripleyarea /&gt;{{Efn|Another source says 100 African American police, assisted by an unspecified number of African American Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department deputies.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=72}}}} would roam the interior of the area. Another 109 representatives of local African American civic and neighborhood groups, assisted by 500 African American volunteers, would assist the police in keeping the area calm.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=68}} This group of volunteers was called the "Mayor's Committee".{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=71}} Nonresident whites would be refused entry to the area,&lt;ref name=ripleyarea /&gt; as would white news media.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=68}}

Overnight, roving bands of youth set 10 fires and engaged in sporadic looting.&lt;ref name=ripleyarea /&gt;{{Efn|A press release by the city on July 25, 1968, listed just three fires.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=74}}}} Civilian patrols were unable to control the looting, much of which was done by young adults and teenagers (some as young as 10 years of age).{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=72–73}} Against Mayor Stokes' direct orders, several white police officers and National Guardsmen violated the cordon during the night and responded to reports of looting. This created such a tense situation at a furniture store at E. 123rd Street and St. Clair Avenue that Law Director Buddy James had to race to the scene and intervene.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=73}} White Cleveland Police were deeply embittered by Stokes' decision to keep them out of the affected area.&lt;ref name=ripleybitter&gt;{{cite news|last=Ripley|first=Anthony|title=Cleveland Police Bitter Over Replacement by Negro Patrols|work=The New York Times|date=July 30, 1968|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a plea for an ambulance for a heart attack victim came in, an anonymous policeman said over the police radio, "White or nigger? Send the Mayor's Committee." When a child in the cordoned-off area fell from a second-floor balcony, an anonymous policeman radioed, "Tell the Mayor's Committee to handle it." When a police dispatcher asked for police to respond to a fire, an anonymous policeman radioed, "Tell the Mayor to go piss on it." Repeatedly, when asked to do their duty, anonymous policemen would radio back "Fuck that nigger Mayor!" When police at the Fifth District Headquarters (which encompassed the affected area){{Efn|The Fifth District headquarters was located at Chester Avenue and E. 107th Street.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=77}}}} were told they could not carry rifles while patrolling the perimeter, those police present "responded in a flurry of curses and epithets" directed at Stokes.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=73}} The anger at Stokes lasted throughout the evening, creating great tension at the Fifth District.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=74}}

At a press conference on the morning of July 25, Mayor Stokes announced that 36 stores had been looted and 13 looters arrested (nearly all of them teenagers) during the night, and no persons had been shot or seriously injured.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=74}}

===July 25===
Regular public transit service and trash pickup through the cordoned area resumed the morning of July 25, and city demolition crews began tearing down the most severely affected and unsafe burned buildings.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=74}}

Early on the morning of July 25, Stokes met with African American civic leaders who had participated in the Mayor's Committee effort. For the most part, only militant groups had participated in the peace patrols. Moderate neighborhood leaders, like pastors, had largely stayed home, and the militants and some other African American civic leaders deeply resented the lack of participation by moderates. There was general agreement that the Mayor's Committee had been only partially effective, and a curfew was discussed. While the group debated, Stokes left the room and held a press conference at which he announced the National Guard would once more patrol Glenville's streets. The mayor's announcement left many African American leaders feeling betrayed.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=74}} Other black officials and white business owners criticized Stokes for using the Mayor's Committee patrols in the first place, which they viewed as a complete failure.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=75}}{{Efn|General Del Corso initially said on July 25 that the citizen patrols were "beginning to be productive. It is proving successful." But on August 9, 1968, he told the Ohio Crime Commission that Stokes had "surrendered to black revolutionaries".{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=75}}}}

After the mayor's announcement, 400 National Guardsmen moved into the cordoned-off area and began patrolling again.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=75}}&lt;ref name=ripleysendsback /&gt; (More than 3,100 National Guardsmen were now in the Cleveland area.)&lt;ref name=ripleysendsback /&gt; The National Guard responded to (sporadic) reports of looting during the day, while police enforced the liquor ban.

Thirty people were arrested (one for arson, two for looting, the rest for curfew violations). After a band of 100 youths formed in the [[Lee-Miles]] neighborhood far from Glenville, the National Guard was sent there to disperse them.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=76}}

===July 26===
Cuyahoga County lifted the ban on alcohol sales outside of Cleveland on the morning of July 26, and Mayor Stokes announced that the curfew that night would begin at midnight (to allow the public to attend a Cleveland Indians home baseball game).{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=76}} In the afternoon, 35 Cleveland Police and 100 National Guardsmen surrounded the Esquire Hotel at 10602 Superior Avenue after police received a tip that several gunmen from the July 23–24 shootout were hiding there.

Mayor Stokes arrived as Jones was being arrested. Police later changed their report, and said brass knuckles were found in Jones' vehicle. A court threw out the case because the search was an unconstitutional violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Warrant|Fourth Amendment]]. After Jones was taken to a local police precinct for booking and Stokes had left, eyewitnesses said police vandalized the group's offices. Few other incidents occurred during the night of July 26 – 27.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=77}}

===July 27: End of the riots===
The ban on alcohol sales in Cleveland was lifted on the morning of July 27.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=76}} The National Guard were withdrawn, Cleveland police were returned to their normal shifts and patrol patterns, and the curfew was lifted.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=77}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ripley|first=Anthony|title=Cleveland Returns to Normal|work=The New York Times|date=July 28, 1968|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The riots cost local business $2.6 million (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|2600000|1968}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Glenville Shootout|website=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History|date=March 27, 1998|accessdate=February 19, 2013|url=http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=GS1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damage was far more widespread than the much better-known Hough riots.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=81}}

On the morning of July 27, the media reported that Evans had received a $6,000 grant from the mayor's [[Cleveland: Now!]] redevelopment fund, and that he had used a portion of this money to buy weapons.&lt;ref name=ripleycharged /&gt;{{sfn|Tittle|1992|page=173}} The revelation during the riots that Evans had used Cleveland: Now! funds to purchase weapons ended political and business support for Mayor Stokes' redevelopment campaign.{{sfn|Tittle|1992|page=173}}

One more serious incident of violence occurred at 2:30 AM on July 28. An African American youth got into an altercation with a security guard at the Haddam Hotel at E. 107th Street and Euclid Avenue. A crowd gathered, with black youth urging the crowd to riot. Cleveland Police responded in force, and a [[police riot]] broke out.  [[NBC News]] photographers Julius Boros and Charles Ray were brutally beaten by a large number of police when they attempted to film and photograph the incident. Law Director Buddy James and Councilman George Forbes rushed to the Fifth District police headquarters, where James witnessed disturbing signs that the police intended harm toward the two men (who had been fingerprinted and jailed).{{Efn|At first, police refused to allow James to enter the Fifth District headquarters, even though he was the city's top legal officer. James witnessed an unusually high number of lieutenants and captains on site, who all claimed to be doing paperwork. All African American patrolmen had been ejected from the station. Most police had removed their badges, and the few badges visible were unnumbered.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=79}}}} An African American policeman accompanying James and Forbes quietly told them that African Americans were being brutally beaten in the station's parking garage. James demanded treatment for Boros.  After examination at [[University Hospitals of Cleveland|Lakeside Hospital]], Boros was given pain medication. Dissatisifed, James ordered Boros transferred to [[MetroHealth|Metropolitan General Hospital]]. This transfer was aborted by NBC attorneys while it was in process, and Boros was returned to Lakeside Hospital where he received no medical care for the several hours. James demanded that Boros be released, but the Cleveland Police delayed doing so repeatedly. When Boros was finally remanded into James' custody and examined near dawn at [[Cleveland Clinic|Lutheran Hospital]], he was found to have broken ribs, a ruptured spleen, a fractured back, a broken tooth, and extensive cuts and abrasions. Boros was charged with assaulting an officer; he was swiftly acquitted in January 1970. The Cleveland Police declined to investigate the police riot at the Haddam Hotel, the attacks on Boros and Ray, the lack of medical treatment given to Boros, or the insubordination shown to James.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=77–81}}

==Legal and other outcomes==
===Ahmed Evans conviction===
Evans was indicted in August 1968 for the murders of Leroy C. Jones, Louis E. Golonka, Willard J. Wolff, and James E. Chapman. The charges were later altered to "kill by shooting" (an easier charge to prove).{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=97}} The prosecution's case rested on state laws which said that a conspirator is guilty of the crimes which his co-conspirators commit.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=97–98}} The prosecution's case was largely circumstantial, but after deliberating for two days the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts on May 12, 1969.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|pages=98–100}} Evans was sentenced to death in the electric chair.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=100}} Evans was incarcerated at [[Southern Ohio Correctional Facility|Lucasville Correctional Facility]],&lt;ref name=convictdies&gt;{{cite news|title=Ohio Activist, Convict, Dies|work=Baltimore Afro-American|date=March 7, 1978|page=11|accessdate=March 25, 2016|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BpslAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VPUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2720%2C1161649}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appealed his conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Black Nationalist Asks For Retrial|work=The Charleston Daily Mail|date=May 13, 1969|page=3|accessdate=March 25, 2016|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/36753354/|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Ahmed Evans — Martyr or Monster?|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=June 3, 1969|page=A12|accessdate=March 25, 2016|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XcpaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0XsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7180%2C2010856}}&lt;/ref&gt; His execution was stayed while he appealed.&lt;ref name=staywon&gt;{{cite news|title=Execution Stay Won By Evans|work=Toledo Blade|date=September 15, 1969|page=10|accessdate=March 25, 2016|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sMkwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sAEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7285%2C1646786}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his appeal was pending, the [[United States Supreme Court]] placed a moratorium on all [[capital punishment in the United States]] in its ruling in ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'', 408 U.S. 238 (1972). Evans' conviction was commuted to life in prison, and he spent the remainder of his life at Lucasville. Evans was diagnosed with [[cancer]] in 1977, and he died on  February 25, 1978, at [[Riverside Methodist Hospital]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=convictdies /&gt;

===Other convictions and civil suit===
Lathan L. Donald (age 19), Alfred Thomas (age 18), John Hardrick (age 17), and Leslie Jackson (age 16) were each indicted on August 25, 1968, on seven counts of [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees|first-degree murder]], 11 counts of [[shooting to wound]]; and possession of a machine gun. Donald and Hardrick were also charged with possession of illegal narcotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five Indicted In Sniper Deaths|work=Toledo Blade|date=August 26, 1968|page=10|accessdate=March 25, 2016|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=S_FOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nQEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3934%2C6206097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardrick and Thomas were detained in the Cleveland City Jail after their arrest.&lt;ref name=2sentenced&gt;{{cite news|title=2 Sentenced in Glenville Shootings|work=The Dover Daily Reporter|date=May 26, 1970|page=24|accessdate=March 25, 2016|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/36007408/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a psychiatric hearing, Alfred Thomas was judged insane and unable to stand trial. He was committed to Lima State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.&lt;ref name=staywon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trial Over, Evans Still Is 'Star'|work=The Pittsburgh Courier|date=August 9, 1969|page=1|accessdate=March 25, 2016|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/38485591/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three and a half days of deliberation, a jury convicted Lathan Donald on August 18, 1969, of three counts of first-degree murder (by conspiracy), and four counts of second-degree murder (by conspiracy). After considering a plea for mercy, the jury granted the plea. Donald was sentenced to seven consecutive terms in prison, without the possibility of parole. His sentence meant that he would spend a minimum of 110 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Convict Negro in Riot Deaths|work=Chicago Tribune|date=August 19, 1969|page=A8|accessdate=March 25, 2016|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/08/19/page/24/article/convict-negro-in-riot-deaths}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Jackson appealed his indictment. His attorneys argued that, under Ohio law, a Juvenile Court was required to find a juvenile delinquent, as well as determine that the juvenile could not be rehabilitated under the juvenile justice system, before that juvenile could be turned over to the Court of Common Pleas for indictment as an adult. His case went to the [[Supreme Court of Ohio]], which in 1970 nullified the indictments against him in ''In re Jackson'', 21 Ohio St.2d 215 (Ohio 1970). The ruling had the effect of nullifying Hardrick's indictments as well. Hardrick and Jackson were then charged with delinquency for wounding Lt. Elmer Joseph during the shootout. Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Charles R. Laurie declined to have the pair re-indicted by the Court of Common Pleas, as the two "were not ring leaders and besides, many key witnesses are no longer available." After hearing evidence that a rifle used by the two was employed to wound Lt. Joseph, Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court Judge Walter G. Whitlatch sentenced Hardrick and Jackson to the Mansfield Youth Center in [[Mansfield, Ohio]]. Both individuals were to be released on their 21st birthday.&lt;ref name=2sentenced /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ohio Teen-Agers Given Reprieve In Murder Case|work=Washington Observer-Reporter|date=May 26, 1970|page=B3|accessdate=March 26, 2016|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Wv1dAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FF8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1555%2C3687694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convictions of Hardrick and Jackson were the last legal actions taken against any individual charged in the Glenville shootout.&lt;ref name=2sentenced /&gt;

In 1971, eight Cleveland police officers and tow truck worker William McMillan sued the city of Cleveland for $8.8 million, arguing that the Stokes administration had negligently paid money to black militants which led directly to their injuries. After more than six years, during which several judges oversaw the case, Common Pleas Judge John C. Bacon ordered the case to trial. After the plaintiffs had finished presenting their case for three weeks, Judge Bacon dismissed the suit, finding that the plaintiffs had offered no evidence showing that Stokes or the Cleveland: Now! trustees knew that payments were going to Evans or other black nationalists.&lt;ref name=abbottcasedism&gt;{{cite news|last=Abbott|first=David T.|title=NOW! Case Dismissed|work=The Plain Dealer|date=May 19, 1977|page=A15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|Mayor Stokes had approved all Cleveland: Now! expenditures, while Cuyahoga County Commissioner [[Seth Taft]] and Cleveland businessman George J. Grabner were trustees of the Cleveland: Now! foundation.  Cleveland: Now! gave money to the [[Greater Cleveland Associated Foundation]], which in turn gave a grant to the Council on Youth Opportunity.  Council chairman Dean G. Ostrom in turn gave a grant to the Hough Area Development Corporation (HADC), a community foundation working to improve business and living conditions in the Hough neighborhood. HADC director DeForest Brown and trustee Julian C. Madison (a local architect) oversaw distribution of funds to Evans. Judge Bacon held that only Brown and Madison knew that funds would go to Evans, and dismissed the case against the other defendants. Testimony from Evans, Donald, and others showed that no HADC funds were misused or diverted to purchase weapons. Rather, the militants used their paychecks to obtain guns, which could not have been foreseen by Brown or Madison. Judge Bacon strongly criticized attorney Milt Schulman, who represented the nine plaintiffs, all but accusing him of [[legal malpractice]] as well as threatening him with [[contempt of court]] for his misbehavior during the trial.&lt;ref name=abbottcasedism /&gt;}}

===Police reforms===
White police on the Cleveland force reacted bitterly toward Stokes after the Glenville shootout, blaming him for supporting radicals like Evans and for providing him with the funds to arm himself. Police began anonymously taunting Stokes and hurling racial epithets at him over police radios.&lt;ref name=ripleybitter /&gt; At a police union meeting on August 1, 600 police voted overwhelmingly to demand the resignation of Public Safety Director James McManamon. In an attempt to turn the police department around, Stokes agreed in September 1968 to establish Cleveland's first [[SWAT]] unit, so that the police could deal with situations like the Glenville shootout in which there was heavy gunfire and entrenched gunmen. He also agreed to hire 500 new police officers, purchase 164 new patrol cars, and establish a police training academy. The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] began urging African Americans to apply for the new positions, and Police Chief Blackwell agreed to racially integrate all police patrols in the Glenville neighborhood.{{sfn|Masotti|Corsi|1969|page=85}}

On October 9, Stokes dismissed Police Chief Michael J. Blackwell for being unable to improve morale in the force and rein in the racial tension, and announced a $17 million overhaul of the police department. Patrick L. Gerity, a 48-year-old police deputy inspector, was named Chief of Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ripley|first=Anthony|title=Stokes Realigns Cleveland police|work=The New York Times|date=October 10, 1968|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The grave of H B Acton, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|The grave of H B Acton, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh]]
'''Harry Burrows Acton''' (2 June 1908 – 16 June 1974), usually cited as '''H. B. Acton''', was an English academic in the field of [[political philosophy]], known for books defending the [[morality]] of [[capitalism]], and attacking [[Marxism-Leninism]].&lt;ref name="BioDict20CPhil"&gt;{{cite book | title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers | year=1996 | publisher=Routledge | location=London | pages=4 | isbn=0-415-06043-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He in particular produced arguments on the incoherence of [[Marxism]], which he described as a 'farrago' (in philosophical terms). His book ''The Illusion of the Epoch'', in which this appears, is a standard point of reference. Other interests were the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], [[Hegel]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[F. H. Bradley]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]] and [[Sidney Webb]].

He had teaching positions at the [[London School of Economics]], [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]], the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he occupied the Chair of Moral Philosophy, and the [[University of Chicago]]. He was editor of ''Philosophy'', the journal of the [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]], of which he was for a time Director. He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1952 to 1953.

He is buried in [[Grange Cemetery]] in [[Edinburgh]] close to the main entrance.

'''Sir Isaiah Berlin''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OM|CBE|FBA}} (1909–1997) was a Russian-British social and political theorist, [[philosopher]] and [[historian of ideas]].&lt;ref name = bbcobit/&gt; Although averse to writing, his improvised lectures and talks were recorded and transcribed, with his spoken word being converted by his secretaries into his published essays and books.

Born in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]], in 1909, he moved to [[Petrograd]], Russia, at the age of six, where he witnessed the revolutions of 1917. In 1921 his family moved to the UK, and he was educated at [[St Paul's School, London]], and [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name = conccat/&gt; In 1932, at the age of 23, Berlin was elected to a prize fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford]]. He translated works by [[Ivan Turgenev]] from Russian into English and, during the war, worked for the [[British Diplomatic Service]]. From 1957 to 1967 he was [[Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory]] at the University of Oxford. He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1963 to 1964. In 1966, he played a role in founding [[Wolfson College, Oxford]], and became its first President. Berlin was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1946, [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1957, and appointed to the [[Order of Merit]] in 1971. He was President of the [[British Academy]] from 1974 to 1978. He also received the 1979 [[Jerusalem Prize]] for his writings on individual freedom.

An annual Isaiah Berlin Lecture is held at the Hampstead Synagogue, at [[Wolfson College, Oxford]], at the British Academy, and in Riga. Berlin's work on [[Contributions to liberal theory#Isaiah Berlin|liberal theory]] and on [[value pluralism]], as well as his opposition to [[Marxism]] and communism, has had a lasting influence. In its obituary of the scholar, ''[[The Independent]]'' stated that:

{{quote|Isaiah Berlin was often described, especially in his old age, by means of superlatives: the world's greatest talker, the century's most inspired reader, one of the finest minds of our time&amp;nbsp;... there is no doubt that he showed in more than one direction the unexpectedly large possibilities open to us at the top end of the range of human potential&lt;ref name = independentobit /&gt;&lt;ref name = bbcobit /&gt;}}

== Early life ==
[[File:Isaiah Berlin plaque Riga.JPG|thumb|Plaque marking what was once Berlin's childhood home (designed by [[Mikhail Eisenstein]]) in Riga, engraved in Latvian, English, and Hebrew with the tribute "The British philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin lived in this house 1909–1915"]]
[[File:Spb_06-2012_English_Embankment_01.jpg|thumb|The [[English Embankment|Angliyskaya Embankment]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], where Berlin lived as a child during the Russian Revolutions]] 
Born 6 June 1909,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Berlin was the only surviving child of a wealthy&lt;ref&gt;''Isaiah Berlin: IN CONVERSATION WITH STEVEN LUKES'', ISAIAH BERLIN and Steven Lukes, Salmagundi,No. 120 (FALL 1998), pp. 52–134&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish family, the son of Mendel Berlin, a timber trader and philanthropist (and a direct descendant of [[Shneur Zalman]], founder of [[Chabad Hasidism]]), and his wife Marie, ''née'' Volshonok. His family owned a timber company, one of the largest in the Baltics,&lt;ref name="ISAIAH BERLIN:CONNECTION WITH RIGA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaiahberlin.org/system/articles/en_pdfs/000/000/003/original/Isaiah_Berlin.Connection_with_Riga.pdf?1400230885|title=ISAIAH BERLIN:CONNECTION WITH RIGA|date=|accessdate=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as forests in Russia,&lt;ref&gt;''Isaiah Berlin: IN CONVERSATION WITH STEVEN LUKES'', ISAIAH BERLIN and Steven Lukes, Salmagundi,No. 120 (FALL 1998), pp. 52-134&lt;/ref&gt; from where the timber was floated down the [[Daugava river]] to its sawmills in Riga. As his father, who was the head of the Riga Association of Timber Merchants,&lt;ref name="ISAIAH BERLIN:CONNECTION WITH RIGA"/&gt; worked for the company in its dealings with Western companies, he was fluent not only in Russian and German, but also French and English. His Russian-speaking mother, Marie Volshonok, was also fluent in [[Latvian language|Latvian]].&lt;ref name=ignatieff30&gt;{{harvnb|Ignatieff|1998|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isaiah Berlin spent his first six years in [[Riga]], and later lived in [[Andreapol]] (a small timber town near [[Pskov]], effectively owned by the family business)&lt;ref name=ignatieff21&gt;{{harvnb|Ignatieff|1998|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Petrograd]] (now Saint Petersburg).  In Petrograd, the family lived first on [[Vasilyevsky Island]] and then on [[English Embankment|Angliyskaya Embankment]] on the [[River Neva]]. On [[English Embankment|Angliyskaya Embankment]], they shared their building with the other tenants being Rimsky-Korsakov's daughter, as well as an assistant Minister of Finnish affairs, and Princess Emeretinsky - and, with the onset of the October Revolution of 1917, the fortunes of the building's tenants were rapidly reversed, with both the Princess Emeretinsky and Rimsky-Korsakov's daughter soon being made to stoke the building's stoves and sweep the yards.&lt;ref name=ignatieff26&gt;{{harvnb|Ignatieff|1998|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin witnessed the [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution]]s both from his apartment windows, and from walks in the city with his governess where he recalled the crowds of protesters marching on the [[Palace Square|Winter Palace Square]].&lt;ref name=ignatieff24&gt;{{harvnb|Ignatieff|1998|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One particular childhood memory of the February Revolution, marked his life-long opposition to violence, with Berlin saying:

{{quote|Well I was seven and a half and something, and then I was&amp;nbsp;– did I tell you the terrible sight of the policeman being dragged&amp;nbsp;– not policeman, a sharp shooter from the rooftop&amp;nbsp;– being dragged away by a lynching bee ... In the early parts of the revolution, the only people who remained loyal to the Tsar was the police, the Pharaon, I've never seen [the term] Pharaon in the histories of the Russian Revolution. They existed, and they did sniping from the rooftops or attics. I saw a man like that, a Pharaon.... That's not in the books, but it is true. And they sniped at the revolutionaries from roofs or attics and things. And this man was dragged down, obviously, by a crowd, and was being obviously taken to a not very agreeable fate, and I saw this man struggling in the middle of a crowd of about twenty ... [T]hat gave me a permanent horror of violence which has remained with me for the rest of my life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lesleychamberlain.wordpress.com/2014/03/29/isaiah-berlin-and-the-policeman Isaiah Berlin and the Policeman] Posted on March 29, 2014, [[Lesley Chamberlain]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Feeling increasingly oppressed by life under [[Bolshevik]] rule where the family was identified as bourgeoisie, the family left Petrograd, on 5 October 1920, for Riga, but encounters with anti-Semitism and difficulties with the Latvian authorities convinced them to leave, and they moved to Britain in early 1921 (Mendel in January, Isaiah and Marie at the beginning of February), when Berlin was eleven.&lt;ref name=ignatieff31&gt;{{harvnb|Ignatieff|1998|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London, the family first stayed in [[Surbiton]] where he was sent to Arundel House for preparatory school, then within the year they bought a house in [[Kensington]], and six years later in [[Hampstead]].

Berlin's [[native language]] was Russian, and his English was virtually nonexistent at first, but he reached proficiency in English within a year at around the age of 12.&lt;ref name=ignatieff33&gt;{{harvnb|Ignatieff|1998|pp=33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Russian and English, Berlin was fluent in French, German and Italian, and knew Hebrew, Latin, and Ancient Greek. Despite his fluency in English, however, in later life Berlin's Oxford English accent would sound increasingly Russian in its vowel sounds.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Isaiah: Personal Impressions of Isaiah Berlin'', edited by Henry Hardy, (Boydell &amp; Brewer 2013), page 180&lt;/ref&gt;  Whenever he was described as an English philosopher, Berlin always insisted that he was not an English philosopher, but would forever be a Russian Jew: "I am a Russian Jew from Riga, and all my years in England cannot change this. I love England, I have been well treated here, and I cherish many things about English life, but I am a Russian Jew; that is how I was born and that is who I will be to the end of my life."&lt;ref&gt;''Cultural Diversity, Liberal Pluralism and Schools: Isaiah Berlin and Education'' (Routledge, 2006), Neil Burtonwood, page 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dubnov A.M. (2012) Becoming a Russian-Jew. In: Isaiah Berlin. Palgrave Studies in Cultural and Intellectual History. Palgrave Macmillan, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
After being educated at [[St Paul's School (London)]], Berlin applied to [[Balliol College, Oxford]], but was denied admission after a chaotic interview. Berlin decided to apply again, only to a different College: [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]]. Berlin was admitted and commenced his [[Classics]] (Greats) degree. He graduated in 1928, taking a First in his final examinations and winning ''The John Locke Prize'' for his performance in the philosophy papers, in which he outscored [[A. J. Ayer]].&lt;ref name=ignatieff57&gt;{{harvnb|Ignatieff|1998|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently took another degree at Oxford in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics|PPE]] ([[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]]), winning another First after less than a year on the course. He was appointed a tutor in philosophy at [[New College, Oxford]], and soon afterwards was elected to a prize fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], the first unconverted Jew to achieve this fellowship at All Souls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/sir-isaiah-s-modest-zionism-1.277389 Sir Isaiah's Modest Zionism]&lt;/ref&gt;

While still a student, he befriended Ayer (with whom he was to share a lifelong amicable rivalry), [[Stuart Hampshire]], [[Richard Wollheim]], [[Maurice Bowra]], [[Stephen Spender]], [[J. L. Austin]] and [[Nicolas Nabokov]]. In 1940, he presented a philosophical paper on other minds to a meeting attended by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] at Cambridge University. Wittgenstein rejected the argument of his paper in discussion but praised Berlin for his intellectual honesty and integrity. Berlin was to remain at Oxford for the rest of his life, apart from a period working for British Information Services in New York from 1940 to 1942, and for the British embassies in Washington, DC, and Moscow from then until 1946. Prior to this service, however, Berlin was barred from participation in the British war effort as a result of his being born in Latvia,&lt;ref&gt;http://contemporarythinkers.org/isaiah-berlin/biography/&lt;/ref&gt; and because his left arm had been damaged at birth. In April 1943 he wrote a confidential analysis of members of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] for the [[Foreign Office]]; he described Senator [[Arthur Capper]] from Kansas as ''a solid, stolid, 78-year-old reactionary from the corn belt, who is the very voice of Mid-Western "grass root" isolationism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/singles/bib139a/bib139a.pdf |title=American Profiles on Capitol Hill: A Confidential Study for the British Foreign Office in 1943 |author=Hachey, Thomas E. |journal=Wisconsin Magazine of History |date=Winter 1973–1974 |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=141–153 |jstor=4634869 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021185357/http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/singles/bib139a/bib139a.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
For his services, he was appointed a CBE in the [[1946 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/37407/pages/53 | title = London Gazette | date = 1 January 1946}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Meetings with [[Anna Akhmatova]] in [[Leningrad]] in November 1945 and January 1946 had a powerful effect on both of them, and serious repercussions for Akhmatova (who immortalised the meetings in her poetry).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/opinion/brooks-love-story.html | first = David | last = Brooks | title = Love Story | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 2 May 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1956 Berlin married Aline Halban, ''née'' de Gunzbourg (1915–2014), who was not only the former wife of an Oxford colleague and a former winner of the ladies' golf championship of France, but from an exiled half Russian-aristocratic and half ennobled-Jewish banking and petroleum family (her mother was Yvonne Deutsch de la Meurthe, granddaughter of [[Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe]]) based in Paris.
[[File:Wolfson College Oxford Berlin Quad.jpg|thumb|300px|The Berlin Quadrangle, [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College]].]]

He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1959.&lt;ref name=aaas/&gt; He was instrumental in the founding, in 1966, of a new graduate college at Oxford University: [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College]]. The college was founded to be a center of academic excellence which, unlike many other colleges at Oxford, would also be based on a strong egalitarian and democratic ethos.&lt;ref name=ignatieff268&gt;{{harvnb|Ignatieff|1998|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin was a member of the Founding Council of the [[Rothermere American Institute]] at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founding Council |url=http://www.rai.ox.ac.uk/about/history/foundingcouncil |publisher=The Rothermere American Institute |accessdate=2012-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117021312/http://www.rai.ox.ac.uk/about/history/foundingcouncil |archivedate=17 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As later revealed, when he was asked to evaluate the academic credentials of [[Isaac Deutscher]], Isaiah Berlin argued against a promotion, because of the profoundly pro-communist militancy of the candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, ''Building: Letters 1960–1975'', ed. Henry Hardy and Mark Pottle (London: Chatto and Windus, 2013), 377–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin died in Oxford on 5 November 1997, aged 88.&lt;ref name = bbcobit /&gt; He is buried there in [[Wolvercote Cemetery]]. On his death, the obituarist of ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote: "he was a man of formidable intellectual power with a rare gift for understanding a wide range of human motives, hopes and fears, and a prodigiously energetic capacity for enjoyment – of life, of people in all their variety, of their ideas and idiosyncrasies, of literature, of music, of art".&lt;ref name = independentobit /&gt; The front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' concluded: "His was an exuberant life crowded with joys – the joy of thought, the joy of music, the joy of good friends. ... The theme that runs throughout his work is his concern with liberty and the dignity of human beings .... Sir Isaiah radiated well-being."&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt;

==Thought==
{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|quote = Though like Our Lord and Socrates he does not publish much, he thinks and says a great deal and has had an enormous influence on our times|source= —[[Maurice Bowra]] on Isaiah Berlin's publishing record.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to [[Noel Annan]] quoted in Lloyd-Jones, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Lecturing and composition ===
Berlin did not enjoy writing, and his published work (including both his essays and books) was produced by means of conversational dictation to a tape-recorder, or through the transcription of his improvised lectures and talks from recorded tapes. The work of transcribing his spoken word often placed a strain on his secretaries.&lt;ref name=ignatieff113&gt;{{harvnb|Ignatieff|1998|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of dictation even extended to his letters, which were produced by speaking to a [[Grundig]] tape recorder, often while simultaneously in conversation with his friends, and then transcribed with difficulty by his secretary, who at times would inadvertently include his jokes and laughter into the transcribed text itself.&lt;ref name=ignatieff113/&gt; The results are a darting and leaping style of thought, which literally reflected his own conversation, and the ornate grammar and punctuation which was contained in his everyday speech.&lt;ref name=ignatieff113/&gt;

==="Two Concepts of Liberty"===
{{main|Two Concepts of Liberty}}
Berlin is popularly known for his essay "Two Concepts of Liberty", delivered in 1958 as his inaugural lecture as Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory at Oxford. The essay, with its analytical approach to the definition of political concepts, reintroduced the methods of [[analytic philosophy]] to the study of political philosophy. Spurred by his background in philosophy of language, Berlin argued for a nuanced and subtle understanding of our political terminology, where what was superficially understood as a single concept could mask a plurality of different uses and therefore meanings. Berlin argued that these multiple and differing concepts, otherwise masked by rhetorical conflations, showed the plurality and incompatibility of human values, and the need for us to distinguish and trade off analytically between, rather than conflate, them if we are to avoid disguising underlying value-conflicts. The two concepts are 'negative freedom', or freedom from interference, which Berlin derived from the British tradition, and 'positive freedom', or freedom as self-mastery, which asks not what we are free from, but what we are free to do. Berlin points out that these two different conceptions of liberty can clash with each other.

=== Counter-Enlightenment ===
{{main|Counter-Enlightenment}}
{{further|Three Critics of the Enlightenment}}
Berlin's lectures on [[the Enlightenment]] and its critics (especially [[Giambattista Vico]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Johann Georg Hamann]], to whose views Berlin referred as [[the Counter-Enlightenment]]) contributed to his advocacy of an irreducibly pluralist ethical [[ontology]].&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; In ''Three Critics of the Enlightenment'', Berlin argues that Hamann was one of the first thinkers to conceive of human [[cognition]] as [[language]] – the articulation and use of symbols. Berlin saw Hamann as having recognised as the rationalist's [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] fallacy the notion that there are "clear and distinct" ideas "which can be contemplated by a kind of inner eye", without the use of language – a recognition greatly sharpened in the 20th century by Wittgenstein's [[private language argument]].&lt;ref name=bleich/&gt;

=== Value pluralism ===
{{main|Value pluralism}}
For Berlin, values are creations of mankind, rather than products of nature waiting to be discovered. He argued, on the basis of the epistemic and empathetic access we have to other cultures across history, that the nature of mankind is such that certain values – the importance of individual liberty, for instance – will hold true across cultures, and this is what he meant by objective pluralism. Berlin's argument was partly grounded in [[Wittgenstein]]'s later theory of language, which argued that inter-translatability was [[supervenient]] on a similarity in forms of life, with the inverse implication that our epistemic access to other cultures entails an ontologically contiguous value-structure. With his account of value pluralism, he proposed the view that moral values may be equally, or rather incommensurably, valid and yet incompatible, and may, therefore, come into conflict with one another in a way that admits of no resolution without reference to particular contexts of a decision. When values clash, it may not be that one is more important than the other: keeping a promise may conflict with the pursuit of truth; liberty may clash with [[social justice]]. Moral conflicts are "an intrinsic, irremovable element in human life". "These collisions of values are of the essence of what they are and what we are."&lt;ref name=theproperstudyofmankind/&gt; For Berlin, this clashing of incommensurate values within, no less than between, individuals, constitutes the tragedy of human life. Alan Brown suggests, however, that Berlin ignores the fact that values are commensurable in the extent to which they contribute to the human good.&lt;ref name=modernpolitical/&gt;

==="The Hedgehog and the Fox"===
{{main|The Hedgehog and the Fox}}
"The Hedgehog and the Fox", a title referring to a fragment of the ancient Greek poet [[Archilochus]], was one of Berlin's most popular essays with the general public, reprinted in numerous editions. Of the classification that gives the essay its title, Berlin once said "I never meant it very seriously. I meant it as a kind of enjoyable intellectual game, but it was taken seriously."&lt;ref name=conversations/&gt;

Berlin expands upon this idea to divide writers and thinkers into two categories: hedgehogs, who view the world through the lens of a single defining idea (examples given include [[Plato]]), and foxes, who draw on a wide variety of experiences and for whom the world cannot be boiled down to a single idea (examples given include [[William Shakespeare]]).

===Other work===
Berlin's lecture "Historical Inevitability" (1954) focused on a controversy in the [[philosophy of history]]. Given the choice, whether one believes that "the lives of entire peoples and societies have been decisively influenced by exceptional individuals" or, conversely, that whatever happens occurs as a result of impersonal forces oblivious to human intentions, Berlin rejected both options and the choice itself as nonsensical. Berlin is also well known for his writings on Russian intellectual history, most of which are collected in ''Russian Thinkers'' (1978; 2nd ed. 2008) and edited, as most of Berlin's work, by [[Henry Hardy]] (in the case of this volume, jointly with Aileen Kelly). Berlin also contributed a number of essays on leading intellectuals and political figures of his time, including [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], and [[Chaim Weizmann]]. Eighteen of these character sketches were published together as "Personal Impressions" (1980; 2nd ed., with four additional essays, 1998; 3rd ed., with a further ten essays, 2014).&lt;ref name=pi3/&gt;

==Commemoration==
A number of commemorative events for Isaiah Berlin are held at Oxford University, as well as scholarships given out in his name, including the Wolfson Isaiah Berlin Clarendon Scholarship, The Isaiah Berlin Visiting Professorship, and the annual Isaiah Berlin Lectures. The Berlin Quadrangle of Wolfson College, Oxford, is named after him. The Isaiah Berlin Association of Latvia was founded in 2011 to promote the ideas and values of Sir Isaiah Berlin, in particular by organising an annual Isaiah Berlin day and lectures in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondsdots.lv/en/news/the-isaiah-berlin-day-in-riga-2015 The Isaiah Berlin Day in Riga 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[British Academy]], the Isaiah Berlin lecture series has been held since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britac.ac.uk/tag/isaiah-berlin-lectures Isaiah Berlin Lectures]&lt;/ref&gt; Many volumes from Berlin's personal library were donated to [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] in [[Beer Sheva]] and form part of the Aranne Library collection. The Isaiah Berlin Room, on the third floor of the library, is a replica of his study at the University of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.bgu.ac.il/en/Pages/news/gurion_berlin.aspx Rare correspondence between Sir Isaiah Berlin and David Ben-Gurion on “Who is a Jew?” donated to BGU]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the Isaiah Berlin Society which takes place at his alma mater of [[St Paul's School (London)]]. The society invites world famous academics to share their research into the answers to life's great concerns and to respond to students' questions. In the last few years they have hosted: A.C. Grayling, Brad Hooker, Jonathan Dancy, John Cottingham, Tim Crane, Arif Ahmed, Hugh Mellor and David Papineau.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk/st-pauls/daily-life/societies-and-activities/isaiah-berlin]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[religion]] of [[Islam]], two words are sometimes translated as [[philosophy]]—''falsafa'' (literally: "philosophy"), which refers to philosophy as well as [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|logic]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]], and [[physics]];&lt;ref name="Hassan-2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hassan|first1=Hassan|title=Don't Blame It on al-Ghazali|url=https://en.qantara.de/content/the-decline-of-islamic-scientific-thought-dont-blame-it-on-al-ghazali|website=qantara.de|accessdate=5 June 2017|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Kalam]]'' (literally "speech"), which refers to a [[Rationalism|rationalist]] form of Islamic philosophy and [[Schools of Islamic theology|theology]] based on the interpretations as developed by [[List of Muslim philosophers|medieval Muslim philosophers]]. 
Islamic philosophy has also been described as the systematic investigation of problems connected with [[Meaning of life#Western and Middle Eastern religions|life]], the [[Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|universe]], [[Islamic ethics|ethics]], [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|medicine]], [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|science]], [[Islamic culture|society]], and so on as conducted in the [[History of Islam|medieval]] [[Muslim world]] from [[Persian people|Persian]] ([[Avicenna]], [[al-Biruni]], [[al-Farabi]], [[al-Ghazali]], [[Omar Khayyam|Khayyam]], [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Khwarizmi]], [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|al-Razi]], [[Shahab al-Din Yahya ibn Habash Suhrawardi|Suhrawardi]]), 
[[Arabs|Arab]] ([[al-Kindi]], [[Al-Ash`ari|al-Ashari]], [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]]), and [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] ([[Averroes]], [[at-Turtushi]], [[Ibn Hazm]]) Islamic philosophers, scholars and polymaths during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].

[[Early Islamic philosophy]] began in the 2nd century AH of the [[Islamic calendar]] (early  [[9th century]] [[Common Era|CE]]) and lasted until the 6th century AH (late  [[12th century]] CE). The period is known as the [[Golden Age of Islam]], and the achievements of this period had a crucial influence on the development of [[modern philosophy]] and [[science]] in the [[Western world]]; for [[Renaissance|Renaissance Europe]], the influence represented from the Islamic Golden Age was “one of the largest [[technology]] transfers in world history”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe History of Europe – Middle Ages – Reform and renewal – Christianity, Judaism, and Islam], use TOC&lt;/ref&gt; This period began with [[al-Kindi]] in the 9th century and ended with [[Averroes]] (Ibn Rushd) at the end of 12th century. The death of Averroes effectively marked the end of a particular discipline of Islamic philosophy usually called the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic Arabic School]], and philosophical activity declined significantly in Western Islamic countries such as [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Iberia]] and [[North Africa]].

Islamic philosophy persisted for much longer in Muslim Eastern countries, in particular [[Safavid Persia]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mughal Empire]]s, where several schools of philosophy continued to flourish: [[Avicennism]], [[Averroism]], [[Illuminationist philosophy]], [[Sufi philosophy|Mystical philosophy]], [[Transcendent theosophy]], and [[School of Isfahan|Isfahan philosophy]]. [[Ibn Khaldun]], in his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', made important contributions to the [[philosophy of history]]. Interest in Islamic philosophy revived during the [[Al-Nahda|Nahda]] ("Awakening") movement in the late [[19th century|19th]] and [[20th century|early 20th]] centuries, and continues to the [[Contemporary Islamic philosophy|present day]].

== Introduction ==
{{Arab culture}}
By way of introduction Islamic philosophy refers to philosophy produced in an Islamic society.

Islamic philosophy is a generic term that can be defined and used in different ways. In its broadest sense it means the world view of Islam, as derived from the Islamic texts concerning the creation of the universe and the will of the Creator. In another sense it refers to any of the schools of thought that flourished under the Islamic empire or in the shadow of the Arab-Islamic culture and Islamic civilization. In its narrowest sense it is a translation of ''Falsafa'', meaning those particular schools of thought that most reflect the influence of Greek systems of philosophy such as [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Aristotelianism]].

It is not necessarily concerned with religious issues, nor exclusively produced by [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman, Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; Nor do all schools of thought within Islam admit the usefulness or legitimacy of philosophical inquiry. Some argue that there is no indication that the limited knowledge and experience of humans can lead to truth. It is also important to observe that, while "reason" ('''aql'') is sometimes recognised as a source of Islamic law, this may have a totally different meaning from "reason" in [[philosophy]].
 
The historiography of Islamic philosophy is marked by disputes as to how the subject should be properly interpreted.  Some of the key issues involve the comparative importance of eastern intellectuals such as Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and of western thinkers such as Ibn Rushd,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Henry Corbin]], ''History of Islamic Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; and also whether Islamic philosophy can be read at face value or should be interpreted in an [[esotericism|esoteric]] fashion.  Supporters of the latter thesis, like [[Leo Strauss]], maintain that Islamic philosophers wrote so as to conceal their true meaning in order to avoid [[religious persecution]], but scholars such as [[Oliver Leaman]] disagree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Classical Islamic Philosophy|pages=211–12|author=[[Oliver Leaman]]|edition=2|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521793432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formative influences ==
Islamic philosophy as the name implies refers to philosophical activity within the Islamic milieu. The main sources of classical or early Islamic philosophy are the religion of Islam itself (especially ideas derived and interpreted from the [[Quran]]) and [[Greek philosophy]] which the early Muslims inherited as a result of conquests, along with pre-Islamic [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Persian philosophy]]. Many of the early philosophical debates centered around reconciling religion and reason, the latter exemplified by Greek philosophy.

==Opposition to philosophy==
Some Muslims oppose the idea of philosophy as un-Islamic. The popular Salafist website [[IslamQA.info]] (supervised by Shaykh [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid|Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid]] of [[Islam in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]]) declares philosophy to be an "alien entity": 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The terminology of Islamic philosophy did not emerge as a branch of knowledge that is taught in the curriculum of Islamic studies until it was introduced by Shaykh  [[Mustafa Abdel-Razek|Mustafa Abd al-Raziq]] – the [[List of Grand Imams of al-Azhar|Shaykh of al-Azhar]] – as a reaction to western attacks on Islam based on the idea that Islam has no philosophy.

== Early Islamic philosophy ==
{{main|Early Islamic philosophy}}
[[File:Sughrat.jpg|200px|thumb|An Arabic manuscript from the 13th century depicting [[Socrates]] (Soqrāt) in discussion with his pupils]]

In early Islamic thought, which refers to philosophy during the "[[Islamic Golden Age]]", traditionally dated between the 8th and 12th centuries, two main currents may be distinguished. The first is [[Kalam]], which mainly dealt with [[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] questions, and the other is [[#Falsafa|Falsafa]], which was founded on interpretations of [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. There were attempts by later philosopher-theologians at harmonizing both trends, notably by [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina (Avicenna)]] who founded the school of [[Avicennism]], [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd (Averroës)]] who founded the school of [[Averroism]], and others such as [[Alhacen|Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen)]] and [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]].

===''Kalam''===
{{main|Kalam}}
''ʿIlm al-Kalām'' ({{lang-ar|{{big|علم الكلام}}}}) is the philosophy that seeks [[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] principles through [[dialectic]]. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word literally means "speech".&lt;ref&gt;Simon van den Bergh, in his commentary on [[Averroes]]' ''Incoherence of the Incoherence'', argues that Kalām was influenced by Greek [[Stoicism]] and that the term ''mutakallimun'' (those who speak to each other, i.e. dialecticians) is derived from the Stoics' description of themselves as ''dialektikoi''.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of first debates was that between partisans of the ''[[Predestination in Islam|Qadar]]'' ({{lang|ar|{{big|قدر}}}} meaning "Fate"), who affirmed [[free will]]; and the ''Jabarites'' ({{lang|ar|{{big|جبر}}}} meaning "force", "constraint"), who believed in [[fatalism]].

At the 2nd century of the [[Hijri year|Hijra]], a new movement arose in the theological school of [[Basra]], [[Iraq]]. A pupil of [[Hasan of Basra]], [[Wasil ibn Ata]], left the group when he disagreed with his teacher on whether a Muslim who has committed a major sin invalidates his faith. He systematized the radical opinions of preceding sects, particularly those of the Qadarites and Jabarites. This new school was called ''[[Mu'tazila|Mu'tazilite]]'' (from ''i'tazala'', to separate oneself).

The Mu'tazilites looked in towards a strict [[rationalism]] with which to interpret Islamic doctrine. Their attempt was one of the first to pursue a [[rational theology]] in Islam. They were however severely criticized by other Islamic philosophers, both [[Maturidi]]s and [[Asharites]]. The great Asharite scholar [[Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi]] wrote the work ''Al-Mutakallimin fi 'Ilm al-Kalam'' against the Mutazalites.

In later times, ''Kalam'' was used to mean simply "theology", i.e. the ''duties of the heart'' as opposed to (or in conjunction with) [[fiqh]]'' (jurisprudence), the ''duties of the body''.&lt;ref name="Wolfson1976"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolfson |first=Harry Austryn |title=The philosophy of the Kalam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fuv8J-g7EdAC&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=28 May 2011 |year=1976 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-66580-4 |pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Falsafa''===
''Falsafa'' is a [[Greek language|Greek]] [[loanword]] meaning "philosophy" (the Greek pronunciation ''philosophia'' became ''falsafa''). From the 9th century onward, due to [[Caliph]] [[al-Ma'mun]] and his successor, [[ancient Greek philosophy]] was introduced among the [[arab]]s and the [[Peripatetic School]] began to find able representatives. Among them were [[Al-Kindi]], [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]]. Another trend, represented by the [[Brethren of Purity]], used Aristotelian language to expound a fundamentally [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] and [[Neopythagoreanism|Neopythagorean]] world view.

During the [[Abbasid caliphate]], a number of thinkers and scientists, some of them [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] Muslims or non-Muslims, played a role in transmitting Greek, [[Hindu]] and other pre-Islamic knowledge to the [[Christian]] [[Western world|West]]. They contributed to making [[Aristotle]] known in Christian [[Europe]]. Three speculative thinkers, Al-Farabi, Avicenna and [[Al-Kindi]], combined [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] with other ideas introduced through Islam.

===End of the classical period===
By the 12th century, ''Kalam'', attacked by both the philosophers and the orthodox, perished for lack of champions. At the same time, however, ''Falsafa'' came under serious critical scrutiny.  The most devastating attack came from [[Al-Ghazali]], whose work ''Tahafut al-Falasifa'' (''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'') attacked the main arguments of the Peripatetic School.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, 25, 27.  "In this book [''Intentions of the philosophers''] he seeks to set out clearly the views of his opponents before demolishing them, in the subsequent ''Incoherence of the philosophers''."&lt;/ref&gt;

Averroes, [[Maimonides]]' contemporary, was one of the last of the Islamic Peripatetics and set out to defend the views of the ''Falsafa'' against al-Ghazali's criticism. The theories of Ibn Rushd do not differ fundamentally from those of [[Ibn Bajjah]] and [[Ibn Tufail]], who only follow the teachings of Avicenna and Al-Farabi. Like all Islamic Peripatetics, Averroes admits the hypothesis of the intelligence of the spheres and the hypothesis of universal emanation, through which motion is communicated from place to place to all parts of the universe as far as the supreme world—hypotheses which, in the mind of the Arabic philosophers, did away with the dualism involved in Aristotle's doctrine of pure energy and eternal matter.

But while Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and other Persian and Muslim philosophers hurried, so to speak, over subjects that trenched on traditional beliefs, Ibn Rushd delighted in dwelling upon them with full particularity and stress. Thus he says, "Not only is matter eternal, but form is potentially inherent in matter; otherwise, it were a creation ''ex nihilo''" (Munk, "Mélanges," p.&amp;nbsp;444). According to this theory, therefore, the existence of this world is not only a possibility, as Avicenna declared, but also a necessity.

== Logic ==
{{main|Logic in Islamic philosophy}}

In early Islamic philosophy, [[logic]] played an important role. [[Sharia]] (Islamic law) placed importance on formulating standards of argument, which gave rise to a novel approach to logic in [[Kalam]], but this approach was later displaced by ideas from [[Greek philosophy]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]] with the rise of the [[Mu'tazili]] philosophers, who highly valued [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Organon]]''. The works of Hellenistic-influenced Islamic philosophers were crucial in the reception of Aristotelian logic in medieval Europe, along with the commentaries on the ''Organon'' by [[Averroes]]. The works of [[al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], [[al-Ghazali]] and other Muslim logicians who often criticized and corrected Aristotelian logic and introduced their own forms of logic, also played a central role in the subsequent development of European logic during the [[Renaissance]].

According to the [[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]:

{{quote|"For the Islamic philosophers, logic included not only the study of formal patterns of [[inference]] and their validity but also elements of the philosophy of language and even of [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]]. Because of territorial disputes with the Arabic grammarians, Islamic philosophers were very interested in working out the relationship between logic and language, and they devoted much discussion to the question of the subject matter and aims of logic in relation to reasoning and speech. In the area of formal logical analysis, they elaborated upon the theory of [[terminology|terms]], [[Proposition (philosophy)|proposition]]s and [[syllogism]]s as formulated in Aristotle's Categories, De interpretatione and Prior Analytics. In the spirit of Aristotle, they considered the syllogism to be the form to which all rational argumentation could be reduced, and they regarded syllogistic theory as the focal point of logic. Even poetics was considered as a syllogistic art in some fashion by most of the major Islamic Aristotelians."}}

Important developments made by Muslim logicians included the development of "Avicennian logic" as a replacement of Aristotelian logic. [[Avicenna]]'s [[system of logic]] was responsible for the introduction of [[hypothetical syllogism]], [[Temporal logic|temporal]] [[modal logic]] and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive logic]]. Other important developments in early Islamic philosophy include the development of a strict [[scientific citation|science of citation]], the [[isnad]] or "backing", and the development of a method to disprove claims, the [[ijtihad]], which was generally applied to many types of questions.

===Logic in Islamic law and theology===
Early forms of [[Analogy|analogical reasoning]], [[inductive reasoning]] and categorical [[syllogism]] were introduced in [[Fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence), [[Sharia]] and [[Kalam]] (Islamic theology) from the 7th century with the process of ''[[Qiyas]]'', before the Arabic translations of Aristotle's works. Later, during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], there was debate among Islamic philosophers, logicians and theologians over whether the term ''Qiyas'' refers to analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that ''Qiyas'' refers to inductive reasoning. [[Ibn Hazm]] (994–1064) disagreed, arguing that ''Qiyas'' does not refer to inductive reasoning but to [[Syllogism|categorical syllogistic reasoning]] in a [[Reality|real]] sense and analogical reasoning in a [[metaphor]]ical sense. On the other hand, [[al-Ghazali]] (1058–1111; and, in modern times, [[Abu Muhammad Asem al-Maqdisi]]) argued that ''Qiyas'' refers to analogical reasoning in a real sense and categorical syllogism in a metaphorical sense. Other Islamic scholars at the time, however, argued that the term ''Qiyas'' refers to both analogical reasoning and categorical syllogism in a real sense.&lt;ref&gt;Wael B. Hallaq (1993), ''Ibn Taymiyya Against the Greek Logicians'', p. 48. Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-824043-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotelian logic===
The first original Arabic writings on logic were produced by [[al-Kindi]] (Alkindus) (805–873), who produced a summary on earlier logic up to his time. The first writings on logic with non-Aristotelian elements was produced by [[al-Farabi]] (Alfarabi) (873–950), who discussed the topics of future [[contingent]]s, the [[number]] and relation of the [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]], the relation between [[logic]] and [[grammar]], and non-Aristotelian forms of [[inference]].&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also credited for categorizing logic into two separate groups, the first being "idea" and the second being "[[logical argument|proof]]".

[[Averroes]] (1126–1198), author of the most elaborate commentaries on Aristotelian logic, was the last major logician from [[al-Andalus]].

===Avicennian logic===
[[Avicenna]] (980–1037) developed his own system of logic known as "Avicennian logic" as an alternative to Aristotelian logic. By the 12th century, Avicennian logic had replaced Aristotelian logic as the dominant system of logic in the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;I. M. Bochenski (1961), "On the history of the history of logic", ''A history of formal logic'', pp. 4–10. Translated by I. Thomas, Notre Dame, [[Indiana University Press]]. ([[cf.]] [http://www.formalontology.it/islamic-philosophy.htm Ancient Islamic (Arabic and Persian) Logic and Ontology])&lt;/ref&gt;

The first criticisms of Aristotelian logic were written by [[Avicenna]] (980–1037), who produced independent treatises on logic rather than commentaries. He criticized the logical school of Baghdad for their devotion to Aristotle at the time. He investigated the theory of [[definition]] and [[Classification theorems|classification]] and the [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]] of the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]s of categorical [[Proposition (philosophy)|proposition]]s, and developed an original theory on "[[Temporal logic|temporal]] [[Modal logic|modal]]" syllogism. Its premises included [[Grammatical modifier|modifier]]s such as "at all times", "at most times", and "at some time".

While [[Avicenna]] (980–1037) often relied on [[deductive reasoning]] in philosophy, he used a different approach in medicine. Ibn Sina contributed inventively to the development of [[inductive reasoning|inductive logic]], which he used to pioneer the idea of a [[syndrome]]. In his medical writings, Avicenna was the first to describe the [[Mill's Methods|methods of agreement, difference and concomitant variation]] which are critical to inductive logic and the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', p. 155, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-513580-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Hazm]] (994–1064) wrote the ''Scope of Logic'', in which he stressed on the importance of [[sense]] [[perception]] as a source of knowledge.&lt;ref name=Herald&gt;[http://www.islamherald.com/asp/explore/science/science_muslim_scientists.asp Science and Muslim Scientists], Islam Herald.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel) (1058–1111) had an important influence on the use of logic in theology, making use of Avicennian logic in [[Kalam]].&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Despite the logical sophistication of [[al-Ghazali]], the rise of the [[Ash'ari]] school in the 12th century slowly suffocated original work on logic in much of the Islamic world, though logic continued to be studied in some Islamic regions such as [[History of Iran|Persia]] and the [[Levant]].

[[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] (b. 1149) criticised Aristotle's "[[Syllogism|first figure]]" and developed a form of [[Inductive reasoning|inductive logic]], foreshadowing the system of inductive logic developed by [[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873). Systematic refutations of Greek logic were written by the [[Illuminationist philosophy|Illuminationist school]], founded by [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] (1155–1191), who developed the idea of "decisive necessity", an important innovation in the history of logical philosophical speculation.&lt;ref&gt;Another systematic refutation of Greek logic was written by [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] (1263–1328), the ''Ar-Radd 'ala al-Mantiqiyyin'' (''Refutation of Greek Logicians''), where he argued against the usefulness, though not the validity, of the [[syllogism]] See pp.&amp;nbsp;253–54 of {{citation |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-52069-0 |pages=247–65 |editors=Peter Adamson and Richard C. Taylor |last=Street |first=Tony |title=The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy |chapter=Logic |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in favour of [[inductive reasoning]].

== Metaphysics ==

===Cosmological and ontological arguments===
{{see|Proof of the Truthful|Kalam cosmological argument}}
[[Avicenna]]'s proof for the [[existence of God]] was the first [[ontological argument]], which he proposed in the ''Metaphysics'' section of ''[[The Book of Healing]]''.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;Steve A. Johnson (1984), "Ibn Sina's Fourth Ontological Argument for God's Existence", ''The Muslim World'' '''74''' (3–4), 161–71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morewedge&gt;{{citation |last=Morewedge |first=P. |title=Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Malcolm and the Ontological Argument |journal=Monist |volume=54 |pages=234–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first attempt at using the method of [[A priori (philosophy)|a priori proof]], which utilizes intuition and reason alone. Avicenna's proof of God's existence is unique in that it can be classified as both a [[cosmological argument]] and an ontological argument. "It is ontological insofar as ‘necessary existence’ in intellect is the first basis for arguing for a Necessary Existent". The proof is also "cosmological insofar as most of it is taken up with arguing that contingent existents cannot stand alone and must end up in a Necessary Existent."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Toby |last=Mayer |title=Ibn Sina's ‘Burhan Al-Siddiqin’ |year=2001 |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |publisher=[[Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies]], Oxford Journals, Oxford University Press |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=18–39 |doi=10.1093/jis/12.1.18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinction between essence and existence===
Islamic philosophy, imbued as it is with [[Kalam|Islamic theology]], distinguishes more clearly than [[Aristotelianism]] the difference between [[essence]] and [[existence]]. Whereas existence is the domain of the [[contingent]] and the accidental, essence endures within a [[being]] beyond the accidental. This was first described by [[Avicenna]]'s works on [[metaphysics]], who was himself influenced by [[al-Farabi]].

Some orientalists (or those particularly influenced by [[Thomism|Thomist]] scholarship) argued that Avicenna was the first to view existence (''wujud'') as an accident that happens to the essence (''mahiyya'').  However, this aspect of ontology is not the most central to the distinction that Avicenna established between essence and existence.  One cannot therefore make the claim that Avicenna was the proponent of the concept of [[essentialism]] ''per se'', given that existence (''al-wujud'') when thought of in terms of necessity would ontologically translate into a notion of the "Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself" (''wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi''), which is without description or definition and, in particular, without [[quiddity]] or essence (''la mahiyya lahu''). Consequently, Avicenna's [[ontology]] is '[[Existentialism|existentialist]]' when accounting for being–''[[wikt:qua|qua]]''–existence in terms of necessity (''wujub''), while it is [[Essentialism|essentialist]] in terms of thinking about being–''qua''–existence in terms of "contingency–''qua''–possibility" (''imkan'' or ''mumkin al-wujud'', meaning "contingent being").&lt;ref&gt;For recent discussions of this question, see Nader El-Bizri, "Avicenna and Essentialism", ''The Review of Metaphysics'', Vol. 54 (June 2001), pp. 753–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that Avicenna anticipated [[Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] in "holding that existence is an accident of accidents" and also anticipated [[Alexius Meinong]]'s "view about nonexistent objects."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Herrera Ibáñez |last=Alejandro |title=La distinción entre esencia y existencia en Avicena |journal=Revista Latinoamericana de Filosofía |volume=16 |pages=183–95 |year=1990 |url=http://www.formalontology.it/avicenna.htm |accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also provided early arguments for "a "[[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary]] being" as [[First cause|cause of all other existents]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Hourani George |last=Fadlo |title=Ibn Sina on necessary and possible existence |journal=Philosophical Forum |volume=4 |pages=74–86 |year=1972 |url=http://www.formalontology.it/avicenna-biblio-one.htm |accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of "essence preced[ing] existence" is a concept which dates back to [[Avicenna]]&lt;ref name=Irwin/&gt; and [[Avicennism|his school]] as well as [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]]&lt;ref name="Razavi 1997 129"&gt;{{Harvp|Razavi|1997|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[Illuminationist philosophy]]. "[[Existence precedes essence|Existence preced[ing] essence]]", the opposite (existentialist) notion, was developed in the works of [[Averroes]]&lt;ref name=Irwin/&gt; and [[Mulla Sadra]]'s [[transcendent theosophy]].
&lt;!----Following sounds more like opinion than encyclopedic content..?:
More careful approaches are needed in terms of thinking about philosophers (and theologians) in Islam in terms of phenomenological methods of investigation in [[ontology]] (or onto-theology), or by way of comparisons that are made with [[Heidegger]]'s thought and his critique of the history of metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;For recent studies that engage in this line of research with care and thoughtful deliberation, see: Nader El-Bizri, ''The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;
 -----&gt;

===Resurrection===
Ibn al-Nafis wrote the ''Theologus Autodidactus'' as a defense of "the system of Islam and the Muslims' doctrines on the missions of Prophets, the religious laws, the resurrection of the body, and the transitoriness of the world." The book presents rational arguments for bodily [[resurrection]] and the [[immortality]] of the human soul, using both demonstrative [[reasoning]] and material from the hadith corpus as forms of [[evidence]]. Later Islamic scholars viewed this work as a response to [[Avicenna]]'s [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] argument on [[spirit]]ual resurrection (as opposed to bodily resurrection), which was earlier criticized by [[al-Ghazali]].&lt;ref&gt;Fancy, pp. 42, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soul and spirit===
The [[Islamic medicine|Muslim physician]]-philosophers, [[Avicenna]] and [[Ibn al-Nafis]], developed their own theories on the soul. They both made a distinction between the soul and the [[spirit]], and in particular, the [[Avicennism#Avicennian epistemology and psychology|Avicennian]] doctrine on the nature of the soul was influential among the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]. Some of Avicenna's views on the soul included the idea that the [[immortality]] of the soul is a consequence of its nature, and not a purpose for it to fulfill. In his theory of "The Ten Intellects", he viewed the human soul as the tenth and final [[intellect]].

Avicenna generally supported [[Aristotle]]'s idea of the soul originating from the [[heart]], whereas Ibn al-Nafis on the other hand rejected this idea and instead argued that the soul "is related to the entirety and not to one or a few [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s." He further criticized Aristotle's idea that every unique soul requires the existence of a unique source, in this case the heart. Ibn al-Nafis concluded that "the soul is related primarily neither to the spirit nor to any organ, but rather to the entire matter whose temperament is prepared to receive that soul" and he defined the soul as nothing other than "what a human indicates by saying ‘[[I (pronoun)|I]]’."&lt;ref&gt;Nahyan A. G. Fancy (2006), [http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615 "Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafīs (d. 1288)"], pp. 209–10 (''Electronic Theses and Dissertations'', [[University of Notre Dame]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thought experiments===
{{further|Avicennism#Thought experiments on self-consciousness}}
While he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near [[Hamadhan]], [[Avicenna]] wrote his "Floating Man" [[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality of the soul. He referred to the living human [[intelligence]], particularly the [[active intellect]], which he believed to be the [[Hypostatic abstraction|hypostasis]] by which God communicates truth to the human [[mind]] and imparts order and [[intelligibility (philosophy)|intelligibility]] to [[nature]]. His "Floating Man" thought experiment tells its readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air, isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]], which includes no [[Sense|sensory]] contact with even their own bodies. He argues that, in this scenario, one would still have [[self-consciousness]]. He thus concludes that the idea of the [[Self (philosophy)|self]] is not logically dependent on any physical [[Object (philosophy)|thing]], and that the soul should not be seen in [[relative term]]s, but as a primary given, a [[Substance theory|substance]].&lt;ref name=Leaman&gt;Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 315, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-13159-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument was later refined and simplified by [[René Descartes]] in [[epistemic]] terms when he stated: "I can abstract from the supposition of all external things, but not from the supposition of my own consciousness."&lt;ref name=Leaman/&gt;

===Time===
While ancient Greek philosophers believed that the universe had an infinite past with no beginning, early [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] and theologians developed the concept of the universe having a [[Temporal finitism|finite past]] with a beginning. This view was inspired by the [[creationism]] shared by [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] [[John Philoponus]] presented a detailed argument against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past. Muslim and Arab Jewish philosophers like [[Al-Kindi]], [[Saadia Gaon]], and [[Al-Ghazali]] developed further arguments, with most falling into two broad categories: assertions of the "impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite" and of the "impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition".&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{citation |title=Whitrow and Popper on the Impossibility of an Infinite Past |first=William Lane |last=Craig |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume=30 |issue=2 |date=June 1979 |pages=165–70 [165–66] |doi=10.1093/bjps/30.2.165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Truth===
In [[metaphysics]], [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) defined truth as:

{{quote|"What corresponds in the mind to what is outside it."&lt;ref&gt;Osman Amin (2007), "Influence of Muslim Philosophy on the West", ''Monthly Renaissance'' '''17''' (11).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Avicenna elaborated on his definition of truth in his ''[[Metaphysics]]'':

{{quote|"The truth of a thing is the property of the being of each thing which has been established in it."&lt;ref name=Aertsen&gt;Jan A. Aertsen (1988), ''Nature and Creature: Thomas Aquinas's Way of Thought'', p. 152. BRILL, {{ISBN|90-04-08451-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his ''Quodlibeta'', [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote a commentary on Avicenna's definition of truth in his ''Metaphysics'' and explained it as follows:

{{quote|"The truth of each thing, as Avicenna says in his ''Metaphysica'', is nothing else than the property of its being which has been established in it. So that is called true gold which has properly the being of gold and attains to the established determinations of the nature of gold. Now, each thing has properly being in some nature because it stands under the complete form proper to that nature, whereby being and species in that nature is."&lt;ref name=Aertsen/&gt;}}

Early [[#Political philosophy|Islamic political philosophy]] emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion and emphsized the process of [[ijtihad]] to find truth.

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen) reasoned that to discover the truth about nature, it is necessary to eliminate human opinion and error, and allow the universe to speak for itself.&lt;ref name=Ezine/&gt; In his ''Aporias against Ptolemy'', Ibn al-Haytham further wrote the following comments on truth:

{{quote|"Truth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error..."&lt;ref name=Sabra/&gt;}}

{{quote|"Therefore, the seeker after the truth is not one who studies the writings of the ancients and, following his natural disposition, puts his trust in them, but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration, and not to the sayings of a human being whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. Thus the duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its content, attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency."&lt;ref name=Sabra/&gt;}}

{{quote|"I constantly sought knowledge and truth, and it became my belief that for gaining access to the [[Wiktionary:effulgence|effulgence]] and closeness to God, there is no better way than that of searching for truth and knowledge."&lt;ref name=Plott/&gt;}}

=== Freewill and Predestination ===

The Freewill versus predestination issue is one of the "most contentious topics in classical Islamic thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cillis|first1=Maria|title=Free Will and Predestination in Islamic Thought: Theoretical Compromises in the Works of Avicenna, al-Ghazali and Ibn 'Arabi|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=1YliAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=islam+free+will&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=predestination&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the Islamic belief in [[predestination]], or divine preordainment (''al-qadā wa'l-qadar''), God has full knowledge and control over all that occurs. This is explained in Qur'anic verses such as "Say: 'Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us: He is our protector'..."&lt;ref&gt;
* {{Cite quran|9|51|style=ref}}
* {{Harvtxt|Cohen-Mor|2001|p=4}}: "The idea of predestination is reinforced by the frequent mention of events 'being written' or 'being in a book' before they happen: 'Say: "Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us..."&amp;nbsp;'&amp;nbsp;"
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Fate | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an Online | author=Ahmet T. Karamustafa | ref=harv }}: The verb ''qadara'' literally means "to measure, to determine". Here it is used to mean that "God measures and orders his creation".
&lt;/ref&gt; For Muslims, everything in the world that occurs, good or bad, has been preordained and nothing can happen unless permitted by God. According to Muslim theologians, although events are pre-ordained, man possesses free will in that he or she has the faculty to choose between right and wrong, and is thus responsible for his actions. According to Islamic tradition, all that has been decreed by God is written in ''al-Lawh al-Mahfūz'', the "Preserved Tablet".&lt;ref&gt;

===Atomism===
{{see also|Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam}}
[[Atomism|Atomistic]] philosophies are found very early in Islamic philosophy, and represent a synthesis of the Greek and Indian ideas.  Like both the Greek and Indian versions, Islamic atomism was a charged topic that had the potential for conflict with the prevalent religious orthodoxy.  Yet it was such a fertile and flexible idea that, as in Greece and India, it flourished in some schools of Islamic thought.

The most successful form of Islamic atomism was in the [[Asharite]] school of philosophy, most notably in the work of the philosopher [[al-Ghazali]] (1058–1111).  In [[Asharite]] atomism, atoms are the only perpetual, material things in existence, and all else in the world is "accidental" meaning something that lasts for only an instant.  Nothing accidental can be the cause of anything else, except perception, as it exists for a moment.  Contingent events are not subject to natural physical causes, but are the direct result of God's constant intervention, without which nothing could happen.  Thus nature is completely dependent on God, which meshes with other Asharite Islamic ideas on [[Causality|causation]], or the lack thereof.&lt;ref name="Gardet"&gt;L. Gardet (2001), "djuz’", in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', CD-ROM Edition, v. 1.1, Leiden: Brill&lt;/ref&gt;

Other traditions in Islam rejected the atomism of the Asharites and expounded on many Greek texts, especially those of Aristotle.  An active school of philosophers in Spain, including the noted commentator [[Averroes]] (1126-1198 AD) explicitly rejected the thought of al-Ghazali and turned to an extensive evaluation of the thought of Aristotle.  Averroes commented in detail on most of the works of Aristotle and his commentaries did much to guide the interpretation of Aristotle in later Jewish and Christian scholastic thought.

===Cosmology===
{{main|Astronomy in medieval Islam}}
There are several [[cosmological]] verses in the [[Qur'an]] (610–632) which some modern writers have interpreted as foreshadowing the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]] and possibly even the [[Big Bang]] theory:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=A. Abd-Allah |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/scislam.html |title=The Qur'an, Knowledge, and Science |publisher=[[University of Southern California]] |accessdate=2008-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128054613/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/scislam.html |archivedate=2008-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Don't those who reject faith see that the heavens and the earth were a single entity then We ripped them apart?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|21|30|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;And the heavens We did create with Our Hands, and We do cause it to expand.{{cite quran|51|47|style=ref}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] who believed that the [[universe]] had an infinite past with no beginning, [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] and theologians developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning. This view was inspired by the [[creation myth]] shared by the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]], [[John Philoponus]], presented the first such argument against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past. His reasoning was adopted by many, most notably; Muslim philosopher, [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus); the [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]], [[Saadia Gaon]] (Saadia ben Joseph); and the [[Kalam|Muslim theologian]], [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel). They used two logical arguments against an infinite past, the first being the "argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite", which states:&lt;ref name=Craig/&gt;

:"An actual infinite cannot exist."
:"An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite."
:".•. An infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist."

The second argument, the "argument from the impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition", states:&lt;ref name=Craig/&gt;

:"An actual infinite cannot be completed by successive addition."
:"The temporal series of past events has been completed by successive addition."
:".•. The temporal series of past events cannot be an actual infinite."

Both arguments were adopted by later Christian philosophers and theologians, and the second argument in particular became famous after it was adopted by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his thesis of the first antimony concerning time.&lt;ref name=Craig/&gt;

In the 10th century, the [[Brethren of Purity]] published the ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]'', in which a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] view of the universe is expressed in a section on cosmology:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Nasr|1993|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"God has placed the Sun at the center of the Universe just as the capital of a country is placed in its middle and the ruler's palace at the center of the city."}}

===Evolution===

====Struggle for existence====
The [[Mu'tazili]] scientist and philosopher [[al-Jahiz]] (c. 776–869) was the first of the Muslim biologists and philosophers to develop an early theory of [[evolution]]. He speculated on the influence of the environment on animals, considered the effects of the environment on the likelihood of an animal to survive, and first described the [[The Origin of Species#Struggle for existence, natural selection, and divergence|struggle for existence]], a precursor to [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Conway Zirkle (1941). Natural Selection before the "Origin of Species", ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' '''84''' (1), pp. 71–123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mehmet Bayrakdar (Third Quarter, 1983). "Al-Jahiz And the Rise of Biological Evolutionism", ''The Islamic Quarterly''. London.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Jahiz's ideas on the struggle for existence in the ''Book of Animals'' have been summarized as follows:

{{quote|"Animals engage in a struggle for existence; for [[Natural resource|resources]], to avoid being eaten and to [[breed]]. Environmental factors influence [[organism]]s to develop new characteristics to ensure survival, thus transforming into new species. Animals that survive to breed can pass on their successful characteristics to offspring."&lt;ref&gt;Ehsan Masood, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/feb/27/islam-religion-evolution-science], Islam's evolutionary legacy, ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Chapter 47 of ''India'', entitled "On Vasudeva and the Wars of the Bharata," [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] attempted to give a [[Natural history|naturalistic explanation]] as to why the struggles described in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' "had to take place." He explains it using [[Nature|natural]] processes that include [[Biology|biological]] ideas related to evolution, which has led several scholars to compare his ideas to [[Darwinism]] and [[natural selection]]. This is due to Biruni describing the idea of [[artificial selection]] and then applying it to nature:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=On the Presumed Darwinism of Alberuni Eight Hundred Years before Darwin|author=Jan Z. Wilczynski|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|volume=50|issue=4|date=December 1959|pages=459–66 [459–61]|doi=10.1086/348801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The agriculturist selects his corn, letting grow as much as he requires, and tearing out the remainder. The forester leaves those branches which he perceives to be excellent, whilst he cuts away all others. The bees kill those of their kind who only eat, but do not work in their beehive. Nature proceeds in a similar way; however, it does not distinguish for its action is under all circumstances one and the same. It allows the leaves and fruit of the trees to perish, thus preventing them from realising that result which they are intended to produce in the economy of nature. It removes them so as to make room for others."}}

In the 13th century, [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] explains how the [[Classical element|element]]s evolved into [[mineral]]s, then [[plant]]s, then [[animal]]s, and then [[human]]s. Tusi then goes on to explain how [[Heredity|hereditary]] variability was an important factor for biological evolution of [[living thing]]s:&lt;ref name=Alakbarov&gt;Farid Alakbarov (Summer 2001). [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/92_folder/92_articles/92_tusi.html A 13th-Century Darwin? Tusi's Views on Evolution], ''[[Azerbaijan International]]'' '''9''' (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The [[organism]]s that can gain the new features faster are more variable. As a result, they gain advantages over other creatures. [...] The bodies are changing as a result of the internal and external interactions."}}

Tusi discusses how organisms are able to [[Adaptation|adapt]] to their environments:&lt;ref name=Alakbarov/&gt;

{{quote|"Look at the world of animals and birds. They have all that is necessary for defense, protection and daily life, including strengths, courage and appropriate tools [organs] [...] Some of these organs are real weapons, [...] For example, horns-spear, teeth and claws-knife and needle, feet and hoofs-cudgel. The thorns and needles of some animals are similar to arrows. [...] Animals that have no other means of defense (as the gazelle and fox) protect themselves with the help of flight and cunning. [...] Some of them, for example, bees, ants and some bird species, have united in communities in order to protect themselves and help each other."}}

Tusi then explains how humans evolved from advanced animals:&lt;ref name=Alakbarov/&gt;

{{quote|"Such humans [probably [[anthropoid ape]]s] live in the Western [[Sudan]] and other distant corners of the world. They are close to animals by their habits, deeds and behavior. [...] The human has features that distinguish him from other creatures, but he has other features that unite him with the animal world, vegetable kingdom or even with the inanimate bodies."}}

====Transmutation of species====
[[Al-Dinawari]] (828–896), considered the founder of [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution|Arabic botany]] for his ''Book of Plants'', discussed [[plant evolution]] from its birth to its death, describing the phases of [[plant growth]] and the production of flowers and fruit.&lt;ref name=Fahd-815&gt;{{citation |last=Fahd |first=Toufic |title=Botany and agriculture |pages=815 |postscript=.}}, in {{Harvp|Morelon|Rashed|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Miskawayh]]'s ''al-Fawz al-Asghar'' and the [[Brethren of Purity]]'s ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]'' (''The Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa'') developed theories on evolution that possibly had an influence on [[Charles Darwin]] and his inception of [[Darwinism]], but has at one time been criticized as overenthusiastic.&lt;ref name=Muqaddimah-Footnotes&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/Chapter6/Ch_6_05Footnote.htm Footnote 27a] to Chapter 6, Part 5 in {{citation |last=Khaldūn |first=Ibn |others=Franz Rosenthal (trans.) |title=The Muqaddimah |url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"[These books] state that God first created [[matter]] and invested it with [[energy]] for development. Matter, therefore, adopted the form of [[vapour]] which assumed the shape of water in due time. The next stage of development was [[mineral]] life. Different kinds of [[Rock (geology)|stone]]s developed in course of time. Their highest form being mirjan ([[coral]]). It is a stone which has in it branches like those of a tree. After mineral life evolves [[vegetation]]. The evolution of vegetation culminates with a tree which bears the qualities of an animal. This is the [[Date Palm|date-palm]]. It has male and female genders. It does not wither if all its branches are chopped but it dies when the head is cut off. The date-palm is therefore considered the highest among the trees and resembles the lowest among animals. Then is born the lowest of animals. It evolves into an [[ape]]. This is not the statement of Darwin. This is what Ibn Maskawayh states and this is precisely what is written in the ''Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa''. The Muslim thinkers state that ape then evolved into a lower kind of a [[barbarian]] man. He then became a superior human being. Man becomes a [[saint]], a [[prophet]]. He evolves into a higher stage and becomes an [[angel]]. The one higher to angels is indeed none but God. Everything begins from Him and everything returns to Him."&lt;ref name=Hamidullah&gt;[[Muhammad Hamidullah]] and Afzal Iqbal (1993), ''The Emergence of Islam: Lectures on the Development of Islamic World-view, Intellectual Tradition and Polity'', pp. 143–44. Islamic Research Institute, Islamabad.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

English translations of the ''Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity'' were available from 1812,&lt;ref&gt;"Ikhwan as-Safa and their Rasa'il: A Critical Review of a Century and a Half of Research", by A. L. Tibawi, as published in volume 2 of ''The Islamic Quarterly'' in 1955; pp. 28–46&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[manuscript]]s of the ''al-Fawz al-Asghar'' and ''The Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa'' were also available at the [[University of Cambridge]] by the 19th century. These works likely had an influence on 19th-century evolutionists, and possibly [[Charles Darwin]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In the 14th century, [[Ibn Khaldun]] further developed the evolutionary ideas found in the ''Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity''. The following statements from his 1377 work, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', express evolutionary ideas:

{{quote|We explained there that the whole of existence in (all) its simple and composite worlds is arranged in a natural order of ascent and descent, so that everything constitutes an uninterrupted continuum. The essences at the end of each particular stage of the worlds are by nature prepared to be transformed into the essence adjacent to them, either above or below them. This is the case with the simple material elements; it is the case with palms and vines, (which constitute) the last stage of plants, in their relation to snails and shellfish, (which constitute) the (lowest) stage of animals. It is also the case with monkeys, creatures combining in themselves cleverness and perception, in their relation to man, the being who has the ability to think and to reflect. The preparedness (for transformation) that exists on either side, at each stage of the worlds, is meant when (we speak about) their connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/Chapter6/Ch_6_05.htm ''Muqaddimah'', Chapter 6, Part 5]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Plants do not have the same fineness and power that animals have. Therefore, the sages rarely turned to them. Animals are the last and final stage of the three permutations. Minerals turn into plants, and plants into animals, but animals cannot turn into anything finer than themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/Chapter6/Ch_6_29.htm ''Muqaddimah'', Chapter 6, Part 29]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Numerous other Islamic scholars and scientists, including the polymaths [[Ibn al-Haytham]] and [[Al-Khazini]], discussed and developed these ideas. Translated into Latin, these works began to appear in the West after the [[Renaissance]] and may have influenced [[Western philosophy]] and science.

===Phenomenology of Vision===
{{see also|Book of Optics}}
The polymath [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen) is considered a pioneer of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. He articulated a relationship between the physical and observable [[World (philosophy)|world]] and that of [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[psychology]] and [[mental function]]s. His theories regarding knowledge and [[perception]], linking the domains of science and religion, led to a philosophy of existence based on the direct observation of [[reality]] from the observer's point of view. Much of his thought on phenomenology was not further developed until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], 'A Philosophical Perspective on Alhazen's Optics', Arabic Sciences and Philosophy 15 (2005), 189–218; [[Nader El-Bizri]],'La perception de la profondeur: Alhazen, Berkeley, et Merleau-Ponty', Oriens-Occidens: Cahiers du centre d'histoire des sciences et des philosophies arabes et médiévales, CNRS. 5 (2004), 171–184; and see a short essay by Valérie Gonzalez, "Universality and Modernity", ''The Ismaili United Kingdom'', December 2002, pp. 50–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of mind===
{{main|Psychology in medieval Islam}}
The [[philosophy of mind]] was studied in medieval [[Islamic psychological thought]], which refers to the study of the ''[[nafs]]'' (literally "[[Self (philosophy)|self]]" or "[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]" in [[Arabic]]) in the [[Islamic world]], particularly during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (8th–15th centuries) as well as modern times (20th–21st centuries), and is related to [[psychology]], [[psychiatry]] and the [[neuroscience]]s.

===Place and space===
The Arab polymath al-Hasan [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen; died c. 1041) presented a thorough mathematical critique and refutation of [[Aristotle]]'s conception of place (''topos'') in his ''Risala/Qawl fi’l-makan'' (''Treatise/Discourse on Place'').

Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' (Book IV – ''Delta'') stated that the place of something is the two-dimensional boundary of the containing body that is at rest and is in contact with what it contains. Ibn al-Haytham disagreed with this definition and demonstrated that place (''al-makan'') is the imagined (three-dimensional) void (''al-khala' al-mutakhayyal'') between the inner surfaces of the containing body. He showed that place was akin to [[space]], foreshadowing [[Descartes]]'s notion of place as space qua ''Extensio'' or even [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s ''analysis situs''.  Ibn al-Haytham's mathematization of place rested on several geometric demonstrations, including his study on the sphere and other solids, which showed that the [[sphere]] (''al-kura'') is the largest in magnitude (volumetric) with respect to other geometric solids that have equal surface areas.  For instance, a sphere that has an equal surface area to that of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], would be larger in (volumetric) magnitude than the cylinder; hence, the sphere occupies a larger place than that occupied by the cylinder; unlike what is entailed by [[Aristotle]]'s definition of place: that this sphere and that cylinder occupy places that are equal in magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;Nader El-Bizri, "In Defence of the Sovereignty of Philosophy: al-Baghdadi's Critique of Ibn al-Haytham's Geometrisation of Place", ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press), Vol. 17, Issue 1 (2007): 57–80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ibn al-Haytham rejected [[Aristotle]]'s philosophical concept of place on mathematical grounds.  Later, the philosopher [[Abd-el-latif|'Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi]] (13th century) tried to defend the Aristotelian conception of place in a treatise titled: ''Fi al-Radd ‘ala Ibn al-Haytham fi al-makan'' (''A refutation of Ibn al-Haytham's place''), although his effort was admirable from a philosophical standpoint, it was unconvincing from the scientific and mathematical viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;El-Bizri (2007) and handouts of El-Bizri's lectures at the Dept. of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge [http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn al-Haytham also discussed [[Depth perception|space perception]] and its [[Epistemology|epistemological]] implications in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021). His experimental proof of the intromission model of vision led to changes in the way the [[visual perception]] of space was understood, contrary to the previous [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory of vision]] supported by [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]]. In "tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhacen unequivocally rejected the
intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for
correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=A. Mark|last=Smith|title=The Alhacenian Account Of Spatial Perception And Its Epistemological Implications|journal=Arabic Sciences and Philosophy|volume=15|year=2005|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=219–40|doi=10.1017/S0957423905000184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy of education ==

In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], an elementary school was known as a ''[[maktab]]'', which dates back to at least the 10th century. Like [[madrasah]]s (which referred to [[higher education]]), a maktab was often attached to a mosque. In the 11th century, [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (known as ''Avicenna'' in the West), in one of his books, wrote a chapter dealing with the ''maktab'' entitled "The Role of the Teacher in the Training and Upbringing of Children", as a guide to teachers working at ''maktab'' schools. He wrote that children can learn better if taught in [[class (education)|class]]es instead of individual [[tuition]] from private [[tutor]]s, and he gave a number of reasons for why this is the case, citing the value of [[competition]] and emulation among pupils as well as the usefulness of group [[discussion]]s and debates. Ibn Sina described the [[curriculum]] of a ''maktab'' school in some detail, describing the curricula for two stages of education in a ''maktab'' school.&lt;ref name=Asimov&gt;{{citation|title=The Age of Achievement: Vol 4|last=M. S. Asimov|first=Clifford Edmund Bosworth|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|year=1999|isbn=81-208-1596-3|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary education===
Ibn Sina wrote that children should be sent to a ''maktab'' school from the age of 6 and be taught [[primary education]] until they reach the age of 14. During which time, he wrote that they should be taught the [[Qur'an]], [[Islamic metaphysics]], [[Arabic language|language]], [[Islamic literature|literature]], [[Islamic ethics]], and manual skills (which could refer to a variety of practical skills).&lt;ref name=Asimov/&gt;

===Secondary education===
Ibn Sina refers to the [[secondary education]] stage of ''maktab'' schooling as the period of specialization, when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status. He writes that children after the age of 14 should be given a choice to choose and specialize in subjects they have an interest in, whether it was reading, manual skills, literature, preaching, [[Islamic medicine|medicine]], [[Islamic mathematics|geometry]], [[Islamic economics in the world|trade and commerce]], [[Inventions in medieval Islam|craftsmanship]], or any other subject or profession they would be interested in pursuing for a future [[career]]. He wrote that this was a transitional stage and that there needs to be flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduate, as the student's emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Age of Achievement: Vol 4|last=M. S. Asimov|first=Clifford Edmund Bosworth|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|year=1999|isbn=81-208-1596-3|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy of science ==
{{see also|Islamic science}}

===Scientific method===
The pioneering development of the [[scientific method]] by the [[Arab]] [[Ash'ari]] polymath [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen) was an important contribution to the [[philosophy of science]]. In the ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (c. 1025 CE), his scientific method was very similar to the modern scientific method and consisted of the following procedures:&lt;ref name=Ezine&gt;Bradley Steffens (2006). ''Ibn al-Haytham: First Scientist'', Morgan Reynolds Publishing, {{ISBN|1-59935-024-6}}. ([[cf.]] Bradley Steffens, "Who Was the First Scientist?", ''Ezine Articles''.)&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Observation]]
#Statement of [[problem]]
#Formulation of [[hypothesis]]
#Testing of hypothesis using [[experiment]]ation
#Analysis of experimental [[result]]s
#Interpretation of [[data]] and formulation of [[logical consequence|conclusion]]
#[[Publication]] of findings

In ''The Model of the Motions'', Ibn al-Haytham also describes an early version of [[Occam's razor]], where he employs only minimal hypotheses regarding the properties that characterize astronomical motions, as he attempts to eliminate from his planetary model the [[cosmology|cosmological]] hypotheses that cannot be observed from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Roshdi Rashed (2007). "The Celestial Kinematics of Ibn al-Haytham", ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'' '''17''', pp. 7–55 [35–36]. [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Aporias against Ptolemy'', Ibn al-Haytham commented on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge:

{{quote|"Truth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error..."&lt;ref name=Sabra&gt;[[A. I. Sabra|Sabra]] (2003). [http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/090351.html Ibn al-Haytham: Brief life of an Arab mathematician] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224948/http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/090351.html |date=2007-09-27 }}, ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'', October–December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He held that the criticism of existing theories—which dominated this book—holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge:

{{quote|"Therefore, the seeker after the truth is not one who studies the writings of the ancients and, following his natural disposition, puts his trust in them, but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration, and not to the sayings of a human being whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. Thus the duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its content, attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency."&lt;ref name=Sabra/&gt;}}

Ibn al-Haytham attributed his experimental [[scientific method]] and [[scientific skepticism]] to his Islamic faith. He believed that human beings are inherently flawed and that only God is perfect. He reasoned that to discover the truth about nature, it is necessary to eliminate human opinion and error, and allow the universe to speak for itself.&lt;ref name=Ezine/&gt; In ''The Winding Motion'', Ibn al-Haytham further wrote that [[faith]] should only apply to [[prophets of Islam]] and not to any other authorities, in the following comparison between the Islamic prophetic tradition and the demonstrative sciences:

{{quote|"From the statements made by the noble [[Sheikh|Shaykh]], it is clear that he believes in [[Ptolemy]]'s words in everything he says, without relying on a demonstration or calling on a proof, but by pure imitation ([[taqlid]]); that is how [[Ulema|experts in the prophetic tradition]] have faith in Prophets, may the blessing of God be upon them. But it is not the way that mathematicians have faith in specialists in the demonstrative sciences."&lt;ref&gt;Rashed (2007), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ibn al-Haytham described his search for truth and knowledge as a way of leading him closer to God:

{{quote|"I constantly sought knowledge and truth, and it became my belief that for gaining access to the [[Wiktionary:effulgence|effulgence]] and closeness to God, there is no better way than that of searching for truth and knowledge."&lt;ref name=Plott&gt;C. Plott (2000), ''Global History of Philosophy: The Period of Scholasticism'', Pt. II, p. 465. {{ISBN|81-208-0551-8}}, [[Motilal Banarsidass]] Publ.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His contemporary [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]] also introduced an early scientific method in nearly every field of [[inquiry]] he studied. For example, in his treatise on [[mineralogy]], ''Kitab al-Jamahir'' (''Book of Precious Stones''), he is "the most [[Exact science|exact]] of experimental scientists", while in the introduction to his [[Indology|study of India]], he declares that "to execute our project, it has not been possible to follow the geometric method" and develops [[comparative sociology]] as a scientific method in the field.&lt;ref name=Sardar&gt;{{citation |first=Ziauddin |last=Sardar |author-link=Ziauddin Sardar |year=1998 |contribution=Science in Islamic philosophy |title=Islamic Philosophy |publisher=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H016.htm |accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also responsible for introducing the experimental method into [[mechanics]],&lt;ref name=Rozhanskaya-642&gt;Mariam Rozhanskaya and I.

Unlike his contemporary [[Avicenna]]'s scientific method where "general and universal questions came first and led to experimental work", al-Biruni developed scientific methods where "universals came out of practical, experimental work" and "theories are formulated after discoveries."&lt;ref name=Sardar/&gt; During his debate with Avicenna on [[natural philosophy]], al-Biruni made the first real distinction between a scientist and a [[philosopher]], referring to Avicenna as a philosopher and considering himself to be a mathematical scientist.&lt;ref name=Dallal&gt;{{citation |first=Ahmad |last=Dallal |year=2001–2002 |title=The Interplay of Science and Theology in the Fourteenth-century Kalam |publisher=From Medieval to Modern in the Islamic World, Sawyer Seminar at the [[University of Chicago]] |url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/institute/sawyer/archive/islam/dallal.html |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Biruni's scientific method was similar to the modern scientific method in many ways, particularly his emphasis on repeated experimentation. Biruni was concerned with how to conceptualize and prevent both [[systematic error]]s and [[random errors]], such as "errors caused by the use of small instruments and errors made by human observers." He argued that if instruments produce random errors because of their imperfections or idiosyncratic qualities, then multiple observations must be taken, [[Qualitative research|analyzed qualitatively]], and on this basis, arrive at a "common-sense single value for the [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] sought", whether an [[arithmetic mean]] or a "reliable [[Approximation|estimate]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Glick|Livesey|Wallis|2005|pp=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental medicine===
[[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) is considered the father of modern [[medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;Cas Lek Cesk (1980). "The father of medicine, Avicenna, in our science and culture: Abu Ali ibn Sina (980–1037)", ''Becka J.'' '''119''' (1), pp. 17–23.&lt;/ref&gt; for his introduction of [[experimental medicine]] and [[clinical trial]]s,&lt;ref name=Tschanz&gt;David W. Tschanz, MSPH, PhD (August 2003).

[[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-52994-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in his medical encyclopedia, ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (11th century), which was the first book dealing with experimental medicine. It laid out the following rules and principles for testing the effectiveness of new [[drug]]s or [[medication]]s, which still form the basis of modern clinical trials:&lt;ref name=Tschanz/&gt;

#"The drug must be free from any extraneous accidental quality."
#"It must be used on a simple, not a composite, disease."
#"The drug must be tested with two contrary types of diseases, because sometimes a drug cures one disease by Its essential qualities and another by its accidental ones."
#"The quality of the drug must correspond to the strength of the disease. For example, there are some drugs whose heat is less than the coldness of certain diseases, so that they would have no effect on them."
#"The time of action must be observed, so that essence and accident are not confused."
#"The effect of the drug must be seen to occur constantly or in many cases, for if this did not happen, it was an accidental effect."
#"The experimentation must be done with the human body, for testing a drug on a lion or a horse might not prove anything about its effect on man."

===Peer review===
The first documented description of a [[peer review]] process is found in the ''Ethics of the Physician'' written by [[Ishaq bin Ali al-Rahwi]] (854–931) of [[al-Raha]], [[Syria]], who describes the first [[medical peer review]] process. His work, as well as later [[Islamic medicine|Arabic medical]] manuals, state that a visiting physician must always make duplicate notes of a patient's condition on every visit. When the patient was cured or had died, the notes of the physician were examined by a local medical council of other physicians, who would [[review]] the practising physician's notes to decide whether his/her performance have met the required standards of medical care. If their reviews were negative, the practicing physician could face a [[lawsuit]] from a maltreated patient.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Spier (2002), "The history of the peer-review process", ''Trends in Biotechnology'' '''20''' (8), pp. 357–58 [357].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemology===
{{further|Avicennism#Avicennian epistemology and psychology}}

[[Avicenna]]'s most influential theory in [[epistemology]] is his theory of knowledge, in which he developed the concept of [[tabula rasa]]. He argued that the "human intellect at birth is rather like a tabula rasa, a pure potentiality that is actualized through education and comes to know" and that knowledge is attained through "[[empirical]] familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts" which is developed through a "[[Syllogism|syllogistic]] method of [[reasoning]]; observations lead to prepositional statements, which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts."&lt;ref&gt;Sajjad H. Rizvi (2006), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/avicenna.htm Avicenna/Ibn Sina (c. 980–1037)], ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, [[Ibn Tufail]] further developed the concept of tabula rasa in his [[Arabic literature|Arabic novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqzan]]'', in which he depicted the development of the mind of a [[feral child]] "from a tabula rasa to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society" on a [[desert island]]. The Latin translation of his work, entitled ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', published by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger in 1671, had an influence on [[John Locke]]'s formulation of tabula rasa in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{harvp|Russell|1994|pp=224–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eschatology===
{{main|Islamic eschatology}}
Islamic [[eschatology]] is concerned with the ''[[Qiyamah]]'' ([[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]]; [[Last Judgement]]) and the [[Last Judgment|final judgement of humanity]]. [[Eschatology]] relates to one of the six articles of faith (''[[aqidah]]'') of Islam. Like the other [[Abrahamic religion]]s, Islam teaches the bodily [[resurrection]] of the dead, the fulfillment of a divine plan for creation, and the immortality of the human soul (though Jews do not necessarily view the soul as eternal); the righteous are rewarded with the pleasures of ''[[Jannah]]'' ([[Heaven]]), while the unrighteous are punished in ''[[Jahannam]]'' ([[Hell#Islam|Hell]]). A significant fraction (one third, in fact) of the Quran deals with these beliefs, with many ''[[hadith]]'' elaborating on the themes and details. Islamic apocalyptic literature describing the Armageddon is often known as ''[[Fitna (word)|fitna]]'' (a test) and ''malahim'' (or ''ghayba'' in the [[Shi'a]] tradition).

[[Ibn al-Nafis]] dealt with Islamic eschatology in some depth in his ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'', where he [[Rationality|rationalized]] the Islamic view of eschatology using reason and [[Islamic science|science]] to explain the events that would occur according to Islamic eschatology. He presented his rational and scientific arguments in the form of [[Arabic literature|Arabic fiction]], hence his ''Theologus Autodidactus'' may be considered the earliest [[science fiction]] work.&lt;ref name="Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher"&gt;Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), "Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher", ''Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis'', Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait ([[cf.]] [http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206072116/http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html |date=2008-02-06 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Islamic World'').&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal philosophy===
{{main|Fiqh|Sharia}}
Sharia ({{lang|ar|{{big|شَرِيعَةٌ}}}}) refers to the body of Islamic [[law]]. The term means "way" or "path"; it is the legal framework within which public and some private aspects of life are regulated for those living in a legal system based on Islamic principles of jurisprudence. Fiqh is the term for Islamic jurisprudence, made up of the rulings of Islamic jurists. A component of Islamic studies, Fiqh expounds the methodology by which Islamic law is derived from primary and secondary sources.

Mainstream Islam distinguish ''fiqh'', which means understanding details and inferences drawn by scholars, from ''sharia'' that refers to principles that lie behind the fiqh. Scholars hope that ''fiqh'' and ''sharia'' are in harmony in any given case, but they cannot be sure.&lt;ref&gt;On the Sources of Islamic Law and Practices, The Journal of law and religion {{issn|0748-0814}} Souaiaia 2005 vol: 20 iss:1 p:123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical novels===
The Islamic philosophers, [[Ibn Tufail]] (Abubacer)&lt;ref name=Jon&gt;Jon Mcginnis, ''Classical Arabic Philosophy: An Anthology of Sources'', p. 284, [[Hackett Publishing Company]], {{ISBN|0-87220-871-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ibn al-Nafis]],&lt;ref name=Meyerhof&gt;Muhsin Mahdi (1974), "''The Theologus Autodidactus of Ibn at-Nafis'' by Max Meyerhof, Joseph Schacht", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''94''' (2), pp. 232–34.&lt;/ref&gt; were pioneers of the [[philosophical novel]]. Ibn Tufail wrote the first fictional [[Arabic literature|Arabic novel]] ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (''Philosophus Autodidactus'') as a response to [[al-Ghazali]]'s ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'', and then Ibn al-Nafis also wrote a fictional [[novel]] ''[[Ibn al-Nafis#Theologus Autodidactus|Theologus Autodidactus]]'' as a response to Ibn Tufail's ''Philosophus Autodidactus''. Both of these novels had [[protagonist]]s (Hayy in ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' and Kamil in ''Theologus Autodidactus'') who were [[Autodidacticism|autodidactic]] individuals [[Abiogenesis|spontaneously generated]] in a cave and living in seclusion on a [[desert island]], both being the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy lives alone on the desert island for most of the story in ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in ''Theologus Autodidactus'', developing into the first example of a [[science fiction]] novel.&lt;ref name="Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nahyan A. G. Fancy (2006), "Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafīs (died 1288)", p. 95–101, ''Electronic Theses and Dissertations'', [[University of Notre Dame]].[http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn al-Nafis described his book ''Theologus Autodidactus'' as a defense of "the system of Islam and the Muslims' doctrines on the missions of Prophets, the religious laws, the resurrection of the body, and the transitoriness of the world." He presents rational arguments for bodily [[resurrection]] and the [[immortality]] of the human soul, using both demonstrative [[reasoning]] and material from the hadith corpus to prove his case. Later Islamic scholars viewed this work as a response to the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] claim of Avicenna and Ibn Tufail that bodily resurrection cannot be proven through reason, a view that was earlier criticized by al-Ghazali.&lt;ref&gt;Nahyan A. G. Fancy (2006), "Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafīs (d. 1288)", pp. 42, 60, ''Electronic Theses and Dissertations'', [[University of Notre Dame]].[http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Latin translation of ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' was published in 1671, prepared by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Toomer|1996|pp=220–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first English translation by [[Simon Ockley]] was published in 1708, and [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translations were also published at the time. ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' went on to have a significant influence on [[European literature]],&lt;ref name=Wainwright&gt;Martin Wainwright, [http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,918454,00.html Desert island scripts], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 22 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and became an influential best-seller throughout Western Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name=Russell-228&gt;{{harvp|Russell|1994|p=228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These translations later inspired [[Daniel Defoe]] to write ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', which also featured a desert island narrative and was regarded as the [[first novel in English]].&lt;ref name=Wainwright/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nawal Muhammad Hassan (1980), ''Hayy bin Yaqzan and Robinson Crusoe: A study of an early Arabic impact on English literature'', Al-Rashid House for Publication.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Glasse (2001), ''New [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'', p. 202, Rowman Altamira, {{ISBN|0-7591-0190-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Amber&gt;Amber Haque (2004), "Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists", ''Journal of Religion and Health'' '''43''' (4): 357–77 [369].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Philosophus Autodidactus'' also had a "profound influence" on [[Modern philosophy|modern]] [[Western philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Toomer-218&gt;{{harvp|Toomer|1996|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became "one of the most important books that heralded the [[Scientific Revolution]]" and [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]], and the thoughts expressed in the novel can be found in "different variations and to different degrees in the books of [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Isaac Newton]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Samar Attar]], ''The Vital Roots of European Enlightenment: Ibn Tufayl's Influence on Modern Western Thought'', Lexington Books, {{ISBN|0-7391-1989-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel inspired the concept of "[[tabula rasa]]" developed in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) by Locke, who was a student of Pococke.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Russell|1994|pp=224–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Toomer|1996|pp=221–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' also developed the themes of [[empiricism]], [[tabula rasa]], [[nature versus nurture]],&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; [[condition of possibility]], [[materialism]],&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Urvoy, "The Rationality of Everyday Life: The Andalusian Tradition?

===Political philosophy===
Early Islamic [[political philosophy]] emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion, and the process of [[ijtihad]] to find truth—in effect ''all'' philosophy was "political" as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the [[Mutazilite]] philosophers, who held a more [[secularism|secular]] view and were supported by secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the [[Caliphate]]. The only [[Greek language|Greek]] political treatise known to medieval Muslims at the time was [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. By the end of the [[Islamic Golden Age]], however, the [[Asharite]] view of Islam had in general triumphed.

Islamic political philosophy, was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of Islam, i.e. the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]], the words and practices of Muhammad. However, in the Western thought, it is generally known that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: [[al-Kindi]] (Alkindus), [[al-Farabi]] (Alfarabi), [[Avicenna|İbn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace), [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes), and [[Ibn Khaldun]]. The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah, sultan, ummah, cemaa -and even the "core" terms of the Qur'an, i.e. ibada, din, rab and ilah- is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other [[Fiqh|jurists]] and [[Ulema|ulama]] posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the [[Kharijites|Khawarij]] in the very early years of [[Muslim history|Islamic history]] on [[Caliphate|Khilafa]] and [[Ummah]], or that of [[Shia Islam]] on the concept of [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imamah]] are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the [[Sunni Islam|Ehl-i Sunna]] and Shia in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character.

The 14th-century [[Arab]] scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] is considered one of the greatest political theorists. The British philosopher-anthropologist [[Ernest Gellner]] considered Ibn Khaldun's definition of [[government]], "an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself", the best in the history of political theory.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Gellner, ''Plough, Sword and Book'' (1988), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of history===
The first detailed studies on the subject of [[historiography]] and the first critiques on [[historical method]]s appeared in the works of the [[Arab]] [[Ash'ari]] polymath [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406), who is regarded as the father of [[historiography]], [[cultural history]],&lt;ref&gt;Mohamad Abdalla (Summer 2007). "Ibn Khaldun on the Fate of Islamic Science after the 11th Century", ''Islam &amp; Science'' '''5''' (1), pp. 61–70.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[philosophy of history]], especially for his historiographical writings in the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' ([[Latin]]ized as ''Prolegomena'') and ''Kitab al-Ibar'' (''Book of Advice'').&lt;ref&gt;S. Ahmed (1999). ''A Dictionary of Muslim Names''. C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers. {{ISBN|1-85065-356-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Muqaddimah'' also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[Sovereign state|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systematic bias]] in history,&lt;ref&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; and he discussed the rise and fall of [[civilization]]s.

[[Franz Rosenthal]] wrote in the ''History of Muslim Historiography'':

{{quote|"Muslim historiography has at all times been united by the closest ties with the general development of scholarship in Islam, and the position of historical knowledge in MusIim education has exercised a decisive influence upon the intellectual level of historicai writing... The Muslims achieved a definite advance beyond previous historical writing in the [[sociology|sociological]] understanding of [[history]] and the systematisation of [[historiography]]. The development of modern historical writing seems to have gained considerably in speed and substance through the utilization of a Muslim Literature which enabled western historians, from the 17th century on, to see a large section of the world through foreign eyes. The Muslim historiography helped indirectly and modestly to shape present day historical thinking."&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/~salems2/historiography.htm Historiography]. The Islamic Scholar.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Philosophy of religion===
There is an important question on the relation of religion and philosophy, reason and faith and so on. In one hand there is extraordinary importance attached to religion in Islamic civilization and in other hand they created certain doctrines in respect to reason and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Akbarian،Reza|p=109|2008|Alhekmah » Winter 2008  Number 1|The Relationship Between Religion And Philosophy In The History Of Islamic Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social philosophy===
The social [[philosopher]] and [[Ash'ari]] polymath [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406) was the last major Islamic philosopher from [[Tunis]], North Africa. In his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', he developed the earliest theories on social philosophy, in formulating theories of [[Structural cohesion|social cohesion]] and [[social conflict]]. His ''Muqaddimah'' was also the introduction to a seven volume analysis of [[universal history]].

Ibn Khaldun is considered the "father of [[sociology]]", "father of [[historiography]]", and "father of the [[philosophy of history]]" by some, for allegedly being the first to discuss the topics of sociology, historiography and the philosophy of history in detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ʻAlī|first1=Wardī,|title=A sociological analysis of Ibn Khaldun's theory : a study in the sociology of knowledge|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/15127|date=1 June 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judeo-Islamic philosophies===
{{main|Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)}}
Islamic philosophy found an audience with the Jews, to whom belongs the honor of having transmitted it to the Christian world. A series of eminent men—such as the [[Ibn Tibbon]]s, [[Narboni]], [[Gersonides]]—joined in translating the Arabic philosophical works into Hebrew and commenting upon them. The works of Ibn Rushd especially became the subject of their study, due in great measure to Maimonides, who, in a letter addressed to his pupil [[Joseph ben Judah]], spoke in the highest terms of Ibn Rushd's commentary.

The oldest Jewish religio-philosophical work preserved in Arabic is that of [[Saadia Gaon]] (892–942), ''[[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Emunot ve-Deot]]'', "The Book of Beliefs and Opinions". In this work Saadia treats the questions that interested the Mutakallamin, such as the creation of matter, the unity of God, the divine attributes, the soul, etc. Saadia criticizes other philosophers severely. For Saadia there was no problem as to creation: God created the world ''[[ex nihilo]]'', just as the [[Bible]] attests; and he contests the theory of the Mutakallamin in reference to atoms, which theory, he declares, is just as contrary to reason and religion as the theory of the philosophers professing the eternity of matter.

To prove the unity of God, Saadia uses the demonstrations of the Mutakallamin. Only the attributes of essence (''sifat al-dhatia'') can be ascribed to God, but not the attributes of action (''sifat-al-fi'aliya''). The soul is a substance more delicate even than that of the [[celestial spheres]]. Here Saadia controverts the Mutakallamin, who considered the soul an "accident" '''arad'' (compare [[Guide for the Perplexed]] i. 74), and employs the following one of their premises to justify his position: "Only a substance can be the substratum of an accident" (that is, of a non-essential property of things). Saadia argues: "If the soul be an accident only, it can itself have no such accidents as wisdom, joy, love," etc. Saadia was thus in every way a supporter of the Kalam; and if at times he deviated from its doctrines, it was owing to his religious views.

Since no idea and no literary or philosophical movement ever germinated on Persian or Arabian soil without leaving its impress on the Jews, [[Al Ghazali]] found an imitator in the person of Judah ha-Levi. This poet also took upon himself to free his religion from what he saw as the shackles of speculative philosophy, and to this end wrote the "Kuzari," in which he sought to discredit all schools of philosophy alike. He passes severe censure upon the Mutakallimun for seeking to support religion by philosophy. He says, "I consider him to have attained the highest degree of perfection who is convinced of religious truths without having scrutinized them and reasoned over them" ("Kuzari," v.). Then he reduced the chief propositions of the Mutakallamin, to prove the unity of God, to ten in number, describing them at length, and concluding in these terms: "Does the [[Kalam (islamic term)|Kalam]] give us more information concerning God and His attributes than the prophet did?" (Ib. iii. and iv.) Aristotelianism finds no favor in [[Judah ha-Levi]]'s eyes, for it is no less given to details and criticism; Neoplatonism alone suited him somewhat, owing to its appeal to his poetic temperament.

Similarly the reaction in favour of stricter Aristotelianism, as found in [[Averroes]], had its Jewish counterpart in the work of [[Maimonides]]. Later Jewish philosophers, such as [[Gersonides]] and [[Elijah Delmedigo]], followed the school of Averroes and played a part in transmitting Averroist thought to medieval Europe.

In Spain and Italy, Jewish translators such as [[Abraham de Balmes]] and [[Jacob Mantino]] translated Arabic philosophic literature into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Latin]], contributing to the development of modern European philosophy.

== Later Islamic philosophy ==

The death of [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd (Averroës)]] effectively marks the end of a particular discipline of Islamic philosophy usually called the ''[[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic Arabic School]]'', and philosophical activity declined significantly in western Islamic countries, namely in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and [[North Africa]], though it persisted for much longer in the Eastern countries, in particular [[Iran]] and [[India]]. Contrary to the traditional view, [[Dimitri Gutas]] and the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] consider the period between the 11th and 14th centuries to be the true "[[Golden Age]]" of Arabic and Islamic philosophy, initiated by [[Al-Ghazali]]'s successful integration of [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|logic]] into the [[Madrasah]] curriculum and the subsequent rise of [[Avicennism]].&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web |author=Tony Street |title=Arabic and Islamic Philosophy of Language and Logic |publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=July 23, 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-language |accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the political power shift in Western Europe ([[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) from Muslim to Christian control, the Muslims naturally did not practice philosophy in Western Europe. This also led to some loss of contact between the 'west' and the 'east' of the Islamic world. Muslims in the 'east' continued to do philosophy, as is evident from the works of [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] scholars and especially those living in Muslim kingdoms within the territories of present-day Iran and India, such as Shah Waliullah and [[Ahmad Sirhindi]]. This fact has escaped most pre-modern historians of Islamic (or Arabic) philosophy. In addition, logic has continued to be taught in religious seminaries up to modern times.

After Ibn Rushd, there arose many later schools of Islamic Philosophy. We can mention just a few, such as those founded by [[Ibn Arabi]] and Shiite[[Mulla Sadra]]. These new schools are of particular importance, as they are still active in the Islamic world. The most important among them are:
* [[Illuminationist philosophy|School of Illumination]] (''Hikmat al-Ishraq'')
* [[Transcendent Theosophy]] (''Hikmat Muta'aliah'')
* [[Sufi philosophy]]
* [[Traditionalist School]]
* Avicennism(Hikmat Sinavi)

===Illuminationist school===
{{main|Illuminationist philosophy}}
[[Illuminationist philosophy]] was a school of Islamic philosophy founded by [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] in the 12th century. This school is a combination of [[Avicenna]]'s philosophy and ancient [[Iranian philosophy]], with many new innovative ideas of Suhrawardi. It is often described as having been influenced by [[Neoplatonism]].

In [[logic in Islamic philosophy]], systematic refutations of [[Organon|Greek logic]] were written by the [[Illuminationist philosophy|Illuminationist school]], founded by [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] (1155–1191), who developed the idea of "decisive necessity", an important innovation in the history of [[logic]]al philosophical speculation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamherald.com/asp/explore/science/science_muslim_scientists.asp Science and Muslim Scientists], Islam Herald&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcendent school===
{{main|Transcendent theosophy}}
[[Transcendent theosophy]] is the school of Islamic philosophy founded by [[Mulla Sadra]] in the 17th century. His philosophy and [[ontology]] is considered to be just as important to Islamic philosophy as [[Martin Heidegger]]'s philosophy later was to [[Western philosophy]] in the 20th century. Mulla Sadra bought "a new philosophical insight in dealing with the nature of [[reality]]" and created "a major transition from [[essentialism]] to [[existentialism]]" in Islamic philosophy, several centuries before this occurred in Western philosophy.&lt;ref name="Kamal"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mulla Sadra's Transcendent Philosophy |first=Muhammad |last=Kamal |year=2006 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=0-7546-5271-8 |pages=9, 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of "essence precedes existence" is a concept which dates back to [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina (Avicenna)]]&lt;ref name="Irwin"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Jones|last=Irwin|title=Averroes' Reason: A Medieval Tale of Christianity and Islam|date=Autumn 2002|journal=The Philosopher|volume=LXXXX|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his school of [[Avicennism]] as well as [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]]&lt;ref name="Razavi 1997 129"/&gt; and his [[Illuminationist philosophy]]. The opposite idea of "[[Existence precedes essence]]" was thus developed in the works of [[Averroes]]&lt;ref name="Irwin"/&gt; and [[Mulla Sadra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Razavi|1997|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a reaction to this idea and is a key foundational concept of [[existentialism]].

For Mulla Sadra, "existence precedes the essence and is thus principle since something has to exist first and then have an essence." This is primarily the argument that lies at the heart of Mulla Sadra's [[Transcendent Theosophy]]. Sayyid Jalal Ashtiyani later summarized Mulla Sadra's concept as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Razavi|1997|pp=129–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The existent being that has an essence must then be caused and existence that is pure existence ... is therefore a Necessary Being."}}

More careful approaches are needed in terms of thinking about philosophers (and theologians) in Islam in terms of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] methods of investigation in [[ontology]] (or onto-theology), or by way of comparisons that are made with [[Heidegger]]'s thought and his critique of the history of metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;For recent studies that engage in this line of research with care and thoughtful deliberation, see: [[Nader El-Bizri]], ''The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000); and [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Avicenna and Essentialism', ''Review of Metaphysics'' 54 (2001), 753–78; and [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Avicenna's De Anima Between Aristotle and Husserl', in ''The Passions of the Soul in the Metamorphosis of Becoming'', ed. Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2003), 67–89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary Islamic philosophy===
{{main|Contemporary Islamic philosophy}}

The tradition of Islamic philosophy is still very much alive today [despite the belief in many Western circles that this tradition ceased after the golden ages]{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} of [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi|Suhrawardi]]'s ''Hikmat al-Ishraq'' (''Illumination Philosophy'') or [[Mulla Sadra]]'s ''Hikmat-e-Mota'aliye'' (''Transcendent'' [or ''Exalted''] ''Philosophy''). Another figure is [[Allama Muhammad Iqbal]], who reshaped and revitalized Islamic philosophy among the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allamaiqbal.com/&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam]]''&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allamaiqbal.com/works/prose/english/reconstruction/&lt;/ref&gt; is a milestone in the modern political philosophy of Islam.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

== Criticism ==

Philosophy &lt;!--as such--&gt; has not been without criticism amongst Muslims, both contemporary and past. The imam [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], for whom the [[Hanbali]] school of thought is named, rebuked philosophical discussion, once telling proponents of it that he was secure in his religion, but that they were "in doubt, so go to a doubter and argue with him (instead)."&lt;ref&gt;al-Hilyah (6/324)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Islamic philosophical thought has also been criticized by scholars of the modern [[Salafi]] movement.

There would be many Islamic thinkers who were not enthusiastic about its potential, but it would be incorrect to assume that they opposed philosophy simply because it was a "foreign science". [[Oliver Leaman]], an expert on Islamic philosophy, points out that the objections of notable theologians are rarely directed at philosophy itself, but rather at the conclusions the philosophers arrived at. Even the 11th century [[al-Ghazali]], known for his ''[[Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'' critique of philosophers, was himself an expert in philosophy and [[logic]]. His criticism was that they arrived at theologically erroneous conclusions. In his view the three most serious of these were believing in the co-eternity of the universe with God, denying the bodily resurrection, and asserting that God only has knowledge of abstract universals, not of particular things, though it should be noted that not all philosophers subscribed to these same views.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, O. (1999). ''A Brief Introduction to Islamic Philosophy'' Polity Press. p 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent studies by Muslim contemporary thinkers that aim at "renewing the impetus of philosophical thinking in Islam," the philosopher and theorist [[Nader El-Bizri]] offers a critical analysis of the conventions that dominate mainstream academic and epistemic approaches in studying Islamic philosophy. These approaches, of methodology and [[historiography]] are looked at from archival standpoints within Oriental and Mediaevalist Studies, fail to recognize the fact that philosophy in Islam can still be a living intellectual tradition. He maintains that its renewal requires a radical reform in [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]] within Islamic thought. El-Bizri's interpretations of [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) from the standpoint of [[Heidegger]]'s critique of the history of metaphysics, and specifically against the background of the unfolding of the essence of technology, aim at finding new pathways in ontology that are not simply Avicennian nor Heideggerian, even though El-Bizri's approach in rethinking ''falsafa'' amounts to a "Neo-Avicennism" that carries resonances with novel modern philosophical ways of reading Aristotelianism and Thomism. El-Bizri engages contemporary issues in philosophy through a fundamental critical analytic of the evolution of key concepts in the history of ontology and epistemology. [[Nader El-Bizri]] is a modernist in outlook since he aims at bringing newness to the tradition rather than simply reproduce it or  being in rupture with it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], "The Labyrinth of Philosophy in Islam", in ''Comparative Philosophy'' 1.2 (2010): 3–23. Refer also to his article: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Le renouvellement de la falsafa?', ''Les Cahiers de l’Islam'' I (2014): 17–38.  See also references above in this section of the footnotes to some of [[Nader El-Bizri]]'s other related earlier studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was a younger brother of [[Samuel Clarke]], and was born at [[Norwich]], his father being [[Edward Clarke (MP for Norwich)|Edward Clarke]], textile manufacturer and alderman (M.P. for Norwich 1701), who married Hannah, daughter of Samuel Parmeter. After grammar studies for six years under Mr. Nobbs at [[Norwich School (independent school)|Norwich School]], he was admitted a scholar of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], some time between Michaelmas 1699 and Michaelmas 1700. He graduated B.A. in 1703, M.A. in 1707, and had D.D. by royal command in 1717.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|CLRK699J|Clarke, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Clarke, John (1682-1757)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was known as a mathematician, and lived much of his life at Cambridge. He held a [[prebend]] at Norwich, was a royal chaplain, and canon of Canterbury (1721). On 16 March 1728 he was instituted to the deanery of Salisbury. He died at Salisbury on 10 February 1757, and was buried in the cathedral, where a monument was erected to his memory by his daughters.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Clarke had a son John, who was a Fellow of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], and then vicar of [[Sonning]], dying in 1741.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|CLRK728J|Clarke, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The younger John Clarke engaged in controversy with [[Joseph Clarke (clergyman)|Joseph Clarke]], an opponent of the views of his uncle Samuel Clarke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=5516|title=Clarke, John|first=John|last=Stephens}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Cole (antiquary)|William Cole]] described John Clarke the younger as a lecturer in [[natural philosophy]], and supplied details of his engagement to a French woman in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=5510|title=Clarke, John|first=Anita|last=McConnell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
His own works include:
* ''An Enquiry into the Cause and Origin of Evil''  1720, 2 vols. (the [[Boyle lecture]] for 1719; reproduced in vol. iii. of the abridgement of the Boyle lectures, 1739).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/219/1100.html|title=XI.

* ''A Demonstration of some of the principal sections of Sir Isaac Newton's Principles of Natural Philosophy'', 1730.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Clarke's first literary work was a translation of [[Hugo Grotius]], ''De Veritate'', as ‘The Truth of the Christian Religion,’ 1711, often reprinted. He edited Samuel Clarke's sermons and other works, especially his ‘Exposition of the Church Catechism,’ 1730. He also followed his brother's steps in natural science. Samuel Clarke had translated into Latin, with notes, the ‘Traité de Physique’ (1671) of [[Jacques Rohault]]; John Clarke published an English translation from his brother's Latin, with additional notes, under the title, ‘Rohault's System of Natural Philosophy’ &amp;c., 2 vols.  He edited also the second edition, revised and improved, of [[Humphrey Ditton]]'s ‘An Institution of Fluxions,’ 1726.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1750, he prepared a new edition of [[William Wollaston]]'s ''The Religion of Nature Delineated'', to which he added a life of the author,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fair-use.org/william-wollaston/the-religion-of-nature-delineated/preface|title=A Preface (1722).

'''Joseph Heath''' (born 1967) is a [[professor]] of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Toronto]], where he was formerly the director of the ''Centre for Ethics''. He also teaches at the [[University of Toronto School of Public Policy and Governance|School of Public Policy and Governance]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131224103844/http://www.publicpolicy.utoronto.ca/people/view/64 University of Toronto School of Public Policy and Governance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224103844/http://www.publicpolicy.utoronto.ca/people/view/64 |date=December 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[McGill University]] in 1990, where his teachers included [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], and his [[Master of Arts]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctor of philosophy]] (1995) degrees are from [[Northwestern University]], where he studied under Thomas A. McCarthy and [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref name=trudeau&gt;[http://www.trudeaufoundation.ca/en/community/joseph-heath Biography - Trudeau Fondation], ''www.trudeaufoundation.ca''&lt;/ref&gt; He has published both academic and popular writings, including the bestselling ''[[The Rebel Sell]]''.  His philosophical work includes papers and books in political philosophy, business ethics, rational choice theory, action theory, and critical theory.

Heath is the recipient of the [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation]] Fellowship (2012).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trudeaufoundation.ca/sites/default/files/u5/2012_trudeau_fellows_-_media_release.pdf Media release - Trudeau Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, Heath was named to the [[Royal Society of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rsc-src.ca/sites/default/files/pdf/2013%20New%20Fellows%20Citations.pdf RSC 2013 New Fellows]&lt;/ref&gt; His popular book ''Enlightenment 2.0'' won the 2014 [[Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writerstrust.com/awards/shaughnessy-cohen-prize-for-political-writing.aspx "Writers' Trust of Canada"]. March 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas==
The central claim of ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'' is that [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] movements have failed, and that they all share a common fatal error in the way they understand society; hence, counter-culture is not a threat to "the system".
For example, it is suggested of [[Adbusters]]' [[Adbusters#Blackspot Shoes campaign|Blackspot campaign]] that the shoe's existence proves that "no rational person could possibly believe that there is any tension between 'mainstream' and 'alternative' culture."

In the book ''[[Filthy Lucre (book)|Filthy Lucre]]'', Joseph Heath criticizes the idea that tax-paying is inherently different from consumption, and argues that the idea of a [[tax freedom day]] is flawed:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It would make just as much sense to declare an annual "mortgage freedom day", in order to let mortgage owners know what day they "stop working for the bank and start working for themselves". ...But who cares? Homeowners are not really "working for the bank"; they're merely financing their own consumption. After all, they're the ones living in the house, not the bank manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Heath|first=Joseph|title=Filthy Lucre: Economics for People who Hate Capitalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ns7rAAAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-1-55468-395-6|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Business ethics===
In [[business ethics]], Heath advances a new theory, what he calls a "[[market failure|market failures]]" or "[[Paretian]]" approach, which states that "the market is essentially a staged competition, designed to promote [[Pareto efficiency]], and in cases where the explicit rules governing the competition are insufficient to secure the class of favoured outcomes, economic actors should respect the spirit of these rules and refrain from pursuing strategies that run contrary to the point of the competition". The approach is neither akin to the [[Shareholder primacy|shareholder theory]], the [[stakeholder theory]] or to a personal ethics framework.

Heath’s [[market failure]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s approach follows from his work in [[political economy]]. According to Heath, the market is not a system of natural justice. Rather, it is an imperfect but efficient institutional arrangement designed to maximize [[social welfare]] by way of an unresolved [[collective action problem]].&lt;ref&gt;Heath, 2014, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, markets are "special-purpose institutions designed to promote efficiency", that need to be "embedded within the broader context of a [[welfare state]], which engages in both market-complementing and redistributive policies to claim to be just."&lt;ref name=heath2014&gt;Heath, 2014, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Since these structured competitions are implemented "for the narrow reason" that, in a reasonably competitive market, they generate social benefits through [[positive externalities]], "adversarial ethics" are acceptable in the circumscribed and limited role of markets. Indeed, economic actors engaged in market transaction "must be given a fairly broad exemption from the norms of equality or fairness".&lt;ref name=heath2014 /&gt;

However, they must be held accountable to the fundamental principles required to have a competitive and efficiency promoting market. Therefore, "the central role of [[business ethics]] is […] not to bring in 'outside' moral considerations to condemn the latest outrage, but to clarify and to correct the self-understanding of participants in the market economy […]. In order to do so, it has no need to appeal to normative standards beyond those that are already implicit in the institutions of a market economy." &lt;ref&gt; Heath, 2014, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, "the overall set of profit-maximizing strategies is partitioned into three categories, separating out the immoral and the illegal strategies from the normatively acceptable ones. The efficiency standard can be used to make both cuts. The 'acceptable/unacceptable' distinction is imposed by the efficiency properties of the market system as a whole. The set of unacceptable strategies can then be subdivided into 'immoral/illegal' using a transaction cost or regulatory cost analysis."&lt;ref&gt; Heath, 2014, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the "basic thrust of '[[business ethics]]' is […] to discourage firms from taking advantage of market imperfections, even in cases where legal regulation is not feasible." &lt;ref&gt; Heath, 2014, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, "the firm should behave as though market conditions were perfectly competitive, even though they may not in fact be. The following list of imperatives provides some examples of the restrictions that this would imply :  
# Minimize [[negative externalities]]
# Compete only through price and quality
# Reduce [[information asymmetries]] between firm and customers
# Do not exploit diffusion of ownership
# Avoid erecting [[barriers to entry]]
# Do not use [[cross subsidization|cross-subsidization]] to eliminate competitors
# Do not oppose regulation aimed at correcting market imperfections
# Do not seek [[tariffs]] or other [[Protectionism|protectionist measures]]
# Treat price levels as exogenously determined
# Do not engage in opportunistic behaviour toward customers or others firms"&lt;ref&gt; Heath, 2014, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Kwak Jun-hyeok''' is an Associate Professor of Political Science at [[Korea University]],&lt;ref&gt;http://kupolitics.or.kr&lt;/ref&gt; where he has taught political philosophy and theory since Fall 2007. He also serves as Director of [[EAI Center for Values &amp; Ethics]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eai.or.kr/type/p1.asp?catcode=1910000000&lt;/ref&gt; and Head of Center for Political Theory, [[Peace and Democracy Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peacekorea.or.kr/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; at Korea University. He received his Ph.D. from [[the University of Chicago]] in 2002. Before joining the faculty at Korea University, he taught political thought at [[Kyungpook National University]]. His research interests lie at the crossroads of political thought from [[Socrates]] to [[Machiavelli]] and contemporary political/social theory, with concentration on [[republicanism]], [[nationalism]], [[constitutionalism]], democratic leadership, and [[human rights]]. He teaches classes on constitutionalism and democracy, [[multiculturalism]], politics and [[rhetoric]], human rights, and classical and medieval political thought.

His research currently focuses on constructing reciprocal nondomination as a regulative principle that guides agonistic deliberation between peoples in conflict as well as cultures in tension, with special but not exclusive attention to classical republicans, such as [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], and Machiavelli. Besides, he inquires a way in which reciprocal nondomination can be applicable to various subjects, including [[patriotism]] without nationalism, [[deliberative democracy]], democratic authority, civic responsibility, transnationalism, and multicultural coexistence, etc.. He is now working on books entitled, Liberty as Nondomination: Reconsidering Classical Republicanism, Machiavelli’s Silence, and Patriotism before Nationalism, and running projects “Inherited Responsibility” and “Republican Leadership.”

==The Hellenistic Jewish world==
{{main|Hellenistic Judaism}}
The New Testament Gospels and Epistles were only part of a Hellenistic Jewish culture in the [[Roman Empire]], where [[Roman Alexandria|Alexandria]] had a larger Jewish population than [[Jerusalem during the Early Roman period|Jerusalem]], and Greek was spoken by more Jews than Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Mélèze-Modrzejewski]] ''The Jews of Egypt: from Rameses II to Emperor Hadrian''&lt;/ref&gt; Other Jewish Hellenistic writings include those of [[Jason of Cyrene]], [[Josephus]], [[Philo]], [[Demetrius the chronographer]], [[Eupolemus]], Pseudo-Eupolemus, [[Artapanus of Alexandria]], [[Cleodemus Malchus]], [[Aristeas]], [[Pseudo-Hecataeus]], [[Thallus (historian)|Thallus]], and [[Justus of Tiberias]], [[Pseudo-Philo]], many [[Old Testament Pseudepigrapha]] and the [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] itself.

==Background on Koine Greek==
{{Main|Koine Greek}}
Whereas the [[Ancient Greece|Classical Greek]] [[Polis|city states]] used different dialects of Greek, a common standard, called Koine ({{lang|grc|κοινή}} "common"), developed gradually in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC as a consequence of the formation of larger political structures (like the [[Greek colonies]], [[Athenian Empire]], and the [[Macedon|Macedonian Empire]]) and a more intense cultural exchange in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] area, or in other words the [[Hellenization]] of the empire of [[Alexander the Great]].

In the [[Greek Dark Ages]] and the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Period]], [[Greek colonies]] were founded all over the [[Mediterranean basin]]. However, even though Greek goods were popular in the East, the cultural influence tended to work the other way around. Yet, with the conquests of Alexander the Great (333-323 BC) and the subsequent establishment of [[Hellenistic]] kingdoms (above all, the [[Seleucid Empire]] and [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]), Koine Greek became the dominant language in politics, culture and commerce in the Near East.

During the following centuries, [[Roman Greece|Rome conquered Greece]] and the Macedonian Kingdoms piece for piece until, with the [[Roman Egypt|conquest of Egypt]] in 30 BC, she held all land around the Mediterranean. However, as [[Horace]] gently puts it: "Conquered Greece has conquered the brute victor and brought her arts into rustic Latium" (''Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit et artis intulit agresti Latio''.&lt;ref&gt;Hor., ''Epist.'' 2. 1. 156–7&lt;/ref&gt;) Roman art and literature were [[calque]]d upon Hellenistic models.

Koine Greek remained the dominant language in the eastern part of the [[Roman Empire]], extending into the [[Byzantine Empire]] as Byzantine Greek. In the city of Rome, Koine Greek was in widespread use among ordinary people, and the elite spoke and wrote Greek as fluently as Latin. [[Jewish Koine Greek]] did not exist as a separate dialect, but some Jewish texts in Koine Greek do show the influence of Aramaic in syntax and the influence of Biblical background in vocabulary.

==Languages used in ancient Judea==
{{See also|Aramaic|Hellenistic Judaism}}
After the [[Babylonian captivity]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] replaced [[Biblical Hebrew]] as the everyday language in [[Palestine_(region)|Palestine]]. The two languages were as similar as two [[Romance languages]] or two [[Germanic languages]] today. Thus [[Biblical Hebrew]], which was still used for religious purposes, was not totally unfamiliar, but still a somewhat strange norm that demanded a certain degree of training to be understood properly.

After Alexander, Palestine was ruled by the [[Ptolemaic kingdom|Ptolemies]] and the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] for almost two hundred years. Jewish culture was heavily influenced by Hellenistic culture, and Koine Greek was used not only for international communication, but also as the first language of many Jews. This development was furthered by the fact that the largest Jewish community of the world lived in Ptolemaic [[Alexandria]]. Many of these [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]] would have Greek as their first language, and first the [[Torah]] and then other Jewish scriptures (later the Christian "Old Testament") were therefore translated into standard Koine Greek, i.e. the [[Septuagint]].

Currently, 1,600 Jewish epitaphs (funerary inscriptions) are extant from ancient Palestine dating from 300 B.C. to 500 A.D. Approximately 70 percent are in Greek, about 12 percent are in Latin, and only 18 percent are in Hebrew or Aramaic. "In Jerusalem itself about 40 percent of the Jewish inscriptions from the [[Iudaea province|first century period]] (before 70 C.E.) are in Greek. We may assume that most Jewish Jerusalemites who saw the inscriptions [[in situ]] were able to read them".&lt;ref&gt;Pieter W. Van Der Horst, "Jewish Funerary Inscriptions - Most Are in Greek," ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', Sept.-Oct. 1992, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The language of the New Testament ==

Most biblical scholars adhere to the view that the Greek text of the New Testament is the original version.&lt;ref&gt;The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia p281 ed. Geoffrey W. Bromiley - 1959 "Almost all scholars agree that our Gospel of Matthew was originally written in Greek and is not a translated document. Matthew's Greek reveals none of the telltale marks of a translation."&lt;/ref&gt; However, there does exist an alternative view which maintains that it is a translation from an Aramaic original, a position known as [[Peshitta]] Primacy (also known in primarily non-scholarly circles as "[[Aramaic primacy]]"). Although this view has its adherents, the vast majority of scholars dispute this position citing linguistic, historical, and textual inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://aramaicnt.org/articles/problems-with-peshitta-primacy/; retrieved 3/9/16&lt;/ref&gt; At any rate, since most of the texts are written by [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]] such as [[Paul the Apostle]] and his possibly Gentile companion, [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]], and to a large extent addressed directly to Christian communities in Greek-speaking cities (often communities consisting largely of [[Pauline Christianity|Paul's converts]], which appear to have been non-Jewish in the majority), and since the style of their Greek is impeccable,&lt;ref&gt;F. F. Bruce ''The New Testament Documents''&lt;/ref&gt; a Greek original is more probable than a translation.

Even [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], whose Greek is heavily influenced by his Semitic substratum, seems to presuppose a non-Hebrew audience. Thus, he explains Jewish customs (e.g. {{bibleverse||Mark|7:3-4}}, see also [[Mark 7]]), and he translates Aramaic phrases into Greek ({{bibleverse||Mark|3:17}}: ''boanerges''; {{bibleverse||Mark|5:41}}: ''talitha kum''; {{bibleverse||Mark|7:34}}: ''ephphatha''; {{bibleverse||Mark|14:36}}: ''abba''; {{bibleverse||Mark|15:22}}: ''Golgotha''; {{bibleverse||Mark|15:34}}, see also [[Aramaic of Jesus]] and [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross]]). In the Aramaic [[Peshitta|Syriac version]] of the Bible, these translations are preserved, resulting in odd texts like Mark 15:34:

* '''Greek text'''&lt;br&gt; {{lang|grc|καὶ τῇ ἐνάτῃ ὥρᾳ ἐβόησεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς φωνῇ μεγάλῃ· ελωι ελωι λεμα σαβαχθανι; ὅ ἐστιν μεθερμηνευόμενον Ὁ θεός μου ὁ θεός μου, εἰς τί ἐγκατέλιπές με;}}
* '''Syriac text''' (with rough transliteration)&lt;br&gt; {{lang|syc|ܘܒ݂ܰܬ݂ܫܰܥ ܫܳܥܺܝܢ ܩܥܳܐ ܝܶܫܽܘܥ ܒ݁ܩܳܠܳܐ ܪܳܡܳܐ ܘܶܐܡܰܪ ܐܺܝܠ ܐܺܝܠ ܠܡܳܢܳܐ ܫܒ݂ܰܩܬ݁ܳܢܝ ܕ݁ܺܐܝܬ݂ܶܝܗ ܐܰܠܳܗܝ ܐܰܠܳܗܝ ܠܡܳܢܳܐ ܫܒ݂ܰܩܬ݁ܳܢܝ܂}}&lt;br&gt;{{transl|syc|w&lt;u&gt;b&lt;/u&gt;a&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;ša‘ šā‘yin: q‘ā’ yešua‘ bqālā’ rāmā’ we’mar, ’ēl ’ēl lmānā’ š&lt;u&gt;b&lt;/u&gt;aqtāni di’ai&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;eyh ’elāhi ’elāhi lmānā’ š&lt;u&gt;b&lt;/u&gt;aqtāni}}
* '''[[Authorized King James Version|King James]]'''&lt;br&gt; "And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"

In the [[Peshitta]]:
* Mark 7:34 does not contain the doubled-up meaning.
* Mark 15:34 has two versions of the same expression: the former in Jesus's spoken dialect, the latter in another dialect.

==Languages of Jesus==
{{main|Language of Jesus}}
The languages spoken in Galilee and [[Roman Judaea|Judea during the first century]] include the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Aramaic]] and [[Hebrew]] languages as well as [[Greek language|Greek]], with Aramaic being the predominant language.&lt;ref name=BarrLang &gt;[[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]], ''Which language did Jesus speak'', Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester, 1970; 53(1) pages 9-29 [https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:1m2973]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Porter110 &gt;''Handbook to exegesis of the New Testament'' by [[Stanley E. Porter]] 1997 {{ISBN|90-04-09921-2}} pages 110-112&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars agree that during the early part of first century Aramaic was the mother tongue of virtually all natives of Galilee and Judea.&lt;ref name=Hamp3 &gt;''Discovering the language of Jesus'' by Douglas Hamp 2005 {{ISBN|1-59751-017-3}} page 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars support the theory that [[Aramaic of Jesus|Jesus spoke Aramaic]] and that he may have also spoken Hebrew and Greek.&lt;ref name=BarrLang /&gt;&lt;ref name=Porter110 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus in history and myth'' by R.

Porter]] concluded: "The linguistic environment of Roman Palestine during the first century was much more complex, and allows for the possibility that Jesus himself may well have spoken Greek on occasion."&lt;ref name="Porter164"&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Stanley E. |authorlink=Stanley E.

==Other views==
{{main|Aramaic primacy|Hebrew Gospel hypothesis}}
Critics of the mainstream consensus in favour of Greek being the original language of the New Testament claim logical improbabilities in the Greek Text compared to the Syriac/Hebrew Texts and vocabulary containing wordplay in the Syriac/Hebrew New Testament texts that parallels Hebraic wordplay in the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Original Language of the Lukan Infancy Narrative | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | author=Jung, Chang-Wook | year=2004 | pages=13–15 | isbn=9780567082053 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Gpys3LlUvUAC&amp;pg=PA13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Word Fitly Spoken: Context, Transmission, and Adoption of the Parables of Jesus | publisher=SUNY Press | author=LeRoy Culbertson, Philip | year=1995 | page = 226 | isbn=9780791423110 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=brbKMvUERgoC&amp;pg=PA226}}&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments are rejected by the academic mainstream.

The debate over whether the ancient Chinese masters can be counted as '''philosophy''' has been discussed since the introduction of this academic discipline into China about a hundred years ago.&lt;ref&gt;p. 3, Defoort, Carine, and Ge Zhaoguang. "Editors' Introduction." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural immersion in the West by figures such as [[Hu Shi]] and [[Feng Youlan]] led to an increased interest in a [[Chinese philosophy]] and stimulated the creation of this field which had not yet been labeled nor discussed as such until this point.&lt;ref&gt;p. 4, Defoort, Carine, and Ge Zhaoguang. "Editors' Introduction." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Feng Youlan made sure to make the distinction between ''Zhongguo de zhexue'' [any philosophical activity pursued in China] and ''Zhongguo di zhexue'' [indigenous philosophy from Chinese soil].&lt;ref&gt;p. 4, Defoort, Carine, and Ge Zhaoguang. "Editors' Introduction." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The debates over the legitimacy of Chinese philosophy primarily concern the indigenous philosophy of China.  They range in their central focus: whether the discipline of “philosophy” existed in traditional Chinese thought; whether the subjects and issues involved in the discipline existed in Chinese thought; and whether the now established discipline of Chinese philosophy can be truly be considered Chinese.  These contentions have led to larger questions about the nature of philosophy and its discipline.

==Academic Discipline of Chinese Philosophy==
The discipline of philosophy did not enter China until the 19th century.  [[Nishi Amane]], a Japanese scholar, first translated the term “philosophy” into Chinese as ''zhexue'' (wisdom learning) in 1873. Though he originally coined this term solely to refer to the concept of [[Western Philosophy]], he argued that the nature of the discipline of philosophy was in a constant flux, thus creating an opening for the realm of Chinese philosophy.  After the Western infusion at the turn of the 20th century, an emulation of the Western educational system and its way of categorization spread through China.&lt;ref&gt;p.69, Gan, Chunsong. "Changing from Choice of Methods to Question Awareness: An Interpretation of the Question of the “Legitimacy of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  While ancient Chinese education had been based on ethical education, after the [[Opium War]] the educational system was considered an obstruction in the realization of Chinese potential.&lt;ref&gt;p.81, Gan, Chunsong. "Changing from Choice of Methods to Question Awareness: An Interpretation of the Question of the “Legitimacy of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Dao tong'' (Confucian orthodoxy) was refashioned into the “history of Chinese philosophy,” effectively objectivizing a concept meant to be lived.&lt;ref&gt;p.69, Qiao, Qingju. "Western Discourse and Shadows in the Legitimacy Crisis of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chinese philosophy of the past included classical learning (jinxue), the learning of the ancient masters (zhuzixue) speculative learning (xuanxue), Buddhist learning, and learning of principle (lixue).  While all these branches share common elements with Western philosophy, it was definitively decided that these were not philosophy in their original state.  Hence, there was the subsequent distillation by later scholars using Western notions to form a history of Chinese philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;p.35, Yu, Xuanmeng. "On the New Round of Comparative Studies of Chinese and Western Philosophical Types." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rules for Colleges and Universities in 1903 divided academic subjects into disciplines, with classics as one of these disciplines; by 1913, classical studies was dropped, diminishing its former significance.&lt;ref&gt;p.82, Gan, Chunsong. "Changing from Choice of Methods to Question Awareness: An Interpretation of the Question of the “Legitimacy of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  There were no divisions of scholarship based on the nature of knowledge in China prior to Western importation.&lt;ref&gt;p. 63, Hu, Jun. "The Legitimacy of the Discussions on the “Legitimacy” of “Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1914, [[Beijing University]] created a Division of Chinese Philosophy and in 1919, [[Cai Yuanpei]], the new president, changed the name to the Department of Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;p.13, Zheng, Jiadong. "The Issue of the “Legitimacy” of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  This marked the start of the new academic discipline of Chinese Philosophy.

Chinese philosophy developed under the paradigm of [[Western philosophy]], rather than the other way around, because of the prevalent view in the early twentieth century of the superiority of Western culture.  With advanced military, technology, and a wider dissemination of culture, Western systems of knowledge attained a “universal” quality that relegated Chinese paradigms as “local particularities.”&lt;ref&gt;p.82, Gan, Chunsong. "Changing from Choice of Methods to Question Awareness: An Interpretation of the Question of the “Legitimacy of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet because any global contact will most likely stimulate change, the transformation of traditional Chinese academics can be seen as both an imposition by the West, as well as a conscious choice by the Chinese to move towards a seemingly inevitable direction.

==Arguments Against the Legitimacy of Chinese Philosophy==

===Misinterpretation of Chinese Thought===
The lack of a formal system in traditional Chinese philosophy motivates the creation of a “systemic overcoat.”  There is no historical narrative in Chinese philosophy similar to the one that exists in Western philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;p.15, Zheng, Jiadong. "The Issue of the “Legitimacy” of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The material studied under the discipline of Chinese philosophy had been sifted in the early 20th century from the paradigms of classics, poetry, masters, and collected writings to create this field.&lt;ref&gt;p.19, Zheng, Jiadong. "The Issue of the “Legitimacy” of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The academic philosophical model that is applied now to this discipline appeared only after Hu Shi’s Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy and Feng Youlan’s History of Chinese Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;p.64, Jing, Haifeng. "From “Philosophy” to “Chinese Philosophy”: Preliminary Thoughts in a Postcolonial Linguistic Context." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Feng Youlan and Hu Shi comprehended the lack of narrative in Chinese thought and thus proceeded to create a categorization that mirrored that of the Western paradigm.  However, by preformatting the outline and selectively choosing material that fit, they presented a warped version of the original.&lt;ref&gt;p.66, Jing, Haifeng. "From “Philosophy” to “Chinese Philosophy”: Preliminary Thoughts in a Postcolonial Linguistic Context." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  An accurate understanding of these texts is impossible because the original context has become obscured.  The overcoat may express the concepts of Western philosophy that are present in Chinese thought, but in the process it causes an abstraction from the reality these concepts were couched in originally.&lt;ref&gt;p.49, Ge, Zhaoguang. "Why Is It the “History of Thought”?: Reflections on the “Chinese Philosophy” Issue." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that Chinese thought cannot be translated into Western jargon, when the philosophical method of the West is used to interpret the non-philosophical texts of China.  There are systematic differences in expression between Eastern thought and Western philosophy that prevent comparisons between the two.&lt;ref&gt;p.11, Zheng, Jiadong. "The Issue of the “Legitimacy” of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars would rather prefer the use of only terminology native to Chinese philosophy to research the history of Chinese philosophy, but others object on the basis of academic diversification.&lt;ref&gt;p.73, Qiao, Qingju. "Western Discourse and Shadows in the Legitimacy Crisis of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the explanation of Chinese philosophy with Chinese terms excludes those without a highly specialized and advanced education in this field.  The use of Western terminology allows for a facilitated and more widespread understanding of Chinese philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;p.74, Qiao, Qingju. "Western Discourse and Shadows in the Legitimacy Crisis of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, the danger remains that the continued use of Western discourse will suppress the voices of Chinese scholars and allow the West to retain its dominant position over the East.&lt;ref&gt;p.66, Peng, Yongjie. "On the Legitimacy Crisis of the Discipline Known as “Chinese Philosophy: An Epistemological-Sociological Examination." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.2 (2005-6). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zhang Dainian]] argues that the overcoat does not harm the inner content; that the cleavage does not destroy the content.&lt;ref&gt;p.21, Zheng, Jiadong. "The Issue of the “Legitimacy” of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there are concepts and principles in Chinese philosophy that do not come up in Western philosophy (and vice versa), until there can be a definitive interpretation of the text, a systematic overcoat cannot really be said to confuse the material.&lt;ref&gt;p.16, Zheng, Jiadong. "The Issue of the “Legitimacy” of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The different natures of ancient Chinese thought, modern Chinese thought, and Western philosophy===
The early pioneers of the field of Chinese philosophy ([[Fu Sinian]], [[Cai Yuanpei]], [[Zhang Taiyan]], [[Hu Shi]]) acknowledged the distinctive origin of Chinese thought as ''dao shu'' [Dao craft] and its implicit difference from Western philosophy.  Yet, they also conceded that at that point in time, the Western mode of thought was the only method to convey Chinese philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;p.46, Ge, Zhaoguang. "Why Is It the “History of Thought”?: Reflections on the “Chinese Philosophy” Issue." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Along the same vein, a few decades prior to [[Fu Sinian]] and [[Hu Shi]]'s studies there were similar ideas forming in Japan, particularly among the intellectual society known as the [[Meirokusha|Meiji Six Society]], as they attempted to introduce Western philosophy to Japan in order to bridge the intellectual gap between the East and the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Havens|first=Thomas|title=Nishi Amane and Modern Japanese Thought|year=1970|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0-691-03080-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, modern philosophical scholars when referencing these ancient texts in their own work, reconstruct these studies and create a logical system that do not retain the spirit of these works.  There is a dispute over whether the retention of the traditional Chinese spirit is necessary for the label of Chinese philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;p.5, Defoort, Carine, and Ge Zhaoguang. "Editors' Introduction." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even modern Western philosophers are in stark contrast with [[ancient Greek philosophers]], demonstrating the nonexistence of a universal philosophy.  The two forms of contemporary philosophy are analytical philosophy and phenomenology, both of which differ greatly from traditional Western philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;p.36, Yu, Xuanmeng. "On the New Round of Comparative Studies of Chinese and Western Philosophical Types." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The modern logical reasoning system of Western philosophy renders it closer to the sciences, while Chinese philosophy stems from history and can be considered a religion.

Scholars whose studies involve an examination of Western philosophy have concluded that the presence of [[ontology]] is what makes Western philosophy distinct.  However, ontology is not present in traditional Chinese philosophy, which again brings up the issue of whether to the term “philosophy” is appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;p.35, Yu, Xuanmeng. "On the New Round of Comparative Studies of Chinese and Western Philosophical Types." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political, psychological, and nationalistic motivations===

====Blind veneration of the West====
In attempts for inclusion into the field of philosophy, scholars such as Feng Youlan emphasized certain aspects of classical texts that aligned with Western concepts.  Though at least highlighting some shared ideas, these interpretations presented a skewed perspective of classical texts for they did not stay faithful in presenting the true significance of the works.&lt;ref&gt;p.18, Zheng, Jiadong. "The Issue of the “Legitimacy” of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than creating a philosophical model that reflects the Chinese spirit, what has been created is an exaltation of the Western model by imitation.&lt;ref&gt;p.67, Jing, Haifeng. "From “Philosophy” to “Chinese Philosophy”: Preliminary Thoughts in a Postcolonial Linguistic Context." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nationalism====
The creation of Chinese philosophy can also be seen as a response to the oppressive West.  By establishing an independent discipline with a history just as long as the Western version, Chinese scholars hoped to challenge the domination of the West in this field,&lt;ref&gt;p.46, Ge, Zhaoguang. "Why Is It the “History of Thought”?: Reflections on the “Chinese Philosophy” Issue." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as stimulate national pride.&lt;ref&gt;p.70, Qiao, Qingju. "Western Discourse and Shadows in the Legitimacy Crisis of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Postcolonial Theory====
A rejection of the term Chinese philosophy is a rejection of European [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;p.69, Jing, Haifeng. "From “Philosophy” to “Chinese Philosophy”: Preliminary Thoughts in a Postcolonial Linguistic Context." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The West has structured the subject, cultural identity, and history of the [[Third World]] in a way that forces the Third World to be submissive for they cannot express their subjective experience on their own terms.&lt;ref&gt;p.69, Jing, Haifeng. "From “Philosophy” to “Chinese Philosophy”: Preliminary Thoughts in a Postcolonial Linguistic Context." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of advocating a complete overthrow of Western philosophy and its corresponding models, the proposal is to incorporate the Western theories that have already infiltrated the culture and meld them with the national position.&lt;ref&gt;p.71, Jing, Haifeng. "From “Philosophy” to “Chinese Philosophy”: Preliminary Thoughts in a Postcolonial Linguistic Context." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  While “Western hegemony” per se may be deposed of, Western discourse cannot also go, for it allows the means for the expression and research of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;p.73, Qiao, Qingju. "Western Discourse and Shadows in the Legitimacy Crisis of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistic integrity of the term “philosophy”===
Philosophy itself does not mean just thought; the word is linked to a European history that makes it specific to the West.  This is not to say that Eastern thought does not have an equal value to Western thought, but that the label of philosophy can only be assigned beyond this Western European realm.&lt;ref&gt;p.61, Jing, Haifeng. "From “Philosophy” to “Chinese Philosophy”: Preliminary Thoughts in a Postcolonial Linguistic Context." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Jing Haifeng]] argues that this is a rather narrow view of philosophy.  Rather, he insists that the development of Western philosophy into China and its subsequent tumultuous transformation created a new discipline that, while unique from indigenous learning, still counts as philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;p.61, Jing, Haifeng. "From “Philosophy” to “Chinese Philosophy”: Preliminary Thoughts in a Postcolonial Linguistic Context." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments For the Legitimacy of Chinese Philosophy==

===Ambiguous definition of “philosophy”===
There has never been a complete consensus of the definition of “philosophy.”  If there is to be an argument for a solely Western connotation of philosophy, then the concept of philosophy should be widened to include Chinese thought.  However, this sacrifices a conscious definition of what is and what is not philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;p.13, Zheng, Jiadong. "The Issue of the “Legitimacy” of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those in favor of this prospect refer to the extension of the definition of [[religion]] by Western theologians to include Eastern religions.&lt;ref&gt;p.66, Peng, Yongjie. "On the Legitimacy Crisis of the Discipline Known as “Chinese Philosophy: An Epistemological-Sociological Examination." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.2 (2005-6). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophical models have varied from individuals and civilizations for all of history.&lt;ref&gt;p.65, Hu, Jun. "The Legitimacy of the Discussions on the “Legitimacy” of “Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Recognition of a pluralistic world culture by both Eastern and Western is necessary for a broader definition of philosophy.

Some argue that Chinese philosophy and Western philosophy have evolved independently and are equally as legitimate.  This view escapes the frame of the supreme Western philosophic model and proposes the question of what is philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;p.35, Yu, Xuanmeng. "On the New Round of Comparative Studies of Chinese and Western Philosophical Types." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Western philosophy has the essential component of ontology and developed in that direction.  Similarly, Chinese philosophy centers on self-cultivation and thus developed towards ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|ren]]'' [benevolence] in self-conduct.&lt;ref&gt;p.38, Yu, Xuanmeng. "On the New Round of Comparative Studies of Chinese and Western Philosophical Types." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Past recognition of Chinese philosophy===
Western missionaries in the 17th century called [[Confucius]] a philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;p.6, Defoort, Carine, and Ge Zhaoguang. "Editors' Introduction." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The works of the ancient masters resemble premodern/ancient Western philosophy more so than post-[[Kantian]] thought, which could be considered a link to philosophy.

===Universal topics discussed in Chinese philosophy===
The topics discussed in ancient Chinese thought are universal in philosophy, the term used generally.  The term “philosophy,” itself, may not have existed, but the same subject matters were discussed.  These include topics such as humanity, human nature, and principle.  Deep reflections of life manifest in a multitude of cultures.  [[Mou Zongsan]] used the concept of the particular and universal in explaining the compatibility of Chinese and Western philosophy: each views the world through their own narrow aperture, but through this aperture, each can attain the truth.&lt;ref&gt;p.18, Zheng, Jiadong. “The Issue of the “Legitimacy” of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Western disciplines come from universals extracted from studies of individual phenomena and then condensed into systems of knowledge.  Though the Chinese did not develop thought to this extent, it can be said that the subjects of these disciplines still existed in Chinese thought.&lt;ref&gt;p.64, Hu, Jun. "The Legitimacy of the Discussions on the “Legitimacy” of “Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the strict, regulated Western mode of thinking called [[logic]] was not to be found in China, there was still a form of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;p.65, Hu, Jun. "The Legitimacy of the Discussions on the “Legitimacy” of “Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The search for wisdom has been prevalent in both ancient Greek and ancient Chinese texts.  [[Socrates]] thought of philosophy as a lifestyle search for wisdom.  Rather than a form of academic thought, philosophy meant a path towards truth and wisdom.  Despite the differences in methodology, both the ancient Greeks and ancient Chinese discussed the same topics.&lt;ref&gt;p.66, Hu, Jun. "The Legitimacy of the Discussions on the “Legitimacy” of “Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject of philosophy has been a tradition for both.&lt;ref&gt;p.67, Hu, Jun. "The Legitimacy of the Discussions on the “Legitimacy” of “Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;   Hence, the West cannot be said to have an exclusive hold on the term.  Philosophy has existed for the Chinese in the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] sense.  These pre-Socratic philosophers bear a resemblance to the ancient Chinese philosophers known as [[Wise old man|sages]].&lt;ref&gt;p.38, Yu, Xuanmeng. "On the New Round of Comparative Studies of Chinese and Western Philosophical Types." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Chinese masters’ studies were inherently connected to a way of life.  Using Socrates and [[Plato]]'s definition of philosophy as universal knowledge, it follows that if all people must deal with the issue how to conduct themselves, this should be a philosophical issue.&lt;ref&gt;p.37, Yu, Xuanmeng. "On the New Round of Comparative Studies of Chinese and Western Philosophical Types." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in order to assert the legitimacy of Chinese philosophy, many Chinese scholars have argued that it is more than just an ethics-based philosophy.  They claim that it contains a metaphysical nature and is both transcendental and immanent.  However, the religious nature of this argument has caused sharp criticism from Western sinologists.&lt;ref&gt;p.39, Yu, Xuanmeng. "On the New Round of Comparative Studies of Chinese and Western Philosophical Types." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Crisis Over the Legitimacy of Chinese Philosophy==
The recent flare up of the debates over the legitimacy of Chinese philosophy has been brought upon by a variety of issues.  First, there is the lack of recognition from Western colleagues of the legitimacy of this field.  Moreover, there is disagreement over appropriate uses of methodology and terminology.  The main concern is how scholars can narrate the history of Chinese philosophy in a manner that allows for comprehensive understanding of the topics touched upon.  For at the moment, the Western systematic overcoat creates a Chinese history of philosophy that seems incomplete due to the lack of total overlap between China and the West.&lt;ref&gt;p.85, Gan, Chunsong. "Changing from Choice of Methods to Question Awareness: An Interpretation of the Question of the “Legitimacy of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there is disagreement over the quality of contemporary research on ancient Chinese thought.  Yu Wujin noted especially a lack of knowledge of both philosophy and classical Chinese texts, lack of perspective, weak abstract thinking, in addition to copying and plagiarizing.&lt;ref&gt;p.86, Gan, Chunsong. "Changing from Choice of Methods to Question Awareness: An Interpretation of the Question of the “Legitimacy of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that most do not see these debates over the value of Chinese philosophy, but rather its future.

==Legitimacy of the “Legitimacy” of “Chinese Philosophy”==
To interpret Chinese thought as philosophy requires a complete understanding of both fields of Eastern and Western thought.  Those who have undertaken this interpretation have been trained in a (Western) philosophical discourse that underlies any study of Chinese thought and directs these studies in a corresponding philosophical manner.  Their conclusion has been that philosophical models are not compatible with Chinese models of thought.  However, since these scholars themselves have been immersed in the philosophical model, objective evaluation between the two fields becomes impossible.&lt;ref&gt;p.63, Hu, Jun. "The Legitimacy of the Discussions on the “Legitimacy” of “Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  There can be no impartial evaluation because these discussions must stand outside the realm of both philosophy and Chinese thought.&lt;ref&gt;p.63, Hu, Jun. "The Legitimacy of the Discussions on the “Legitimacy” of “Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus on the methodologies of interpretation rather than the actual text blocks the more significant matter of whether the original material itself can be considered philosophy.  A rejection of the concept of “Chinese philosophy” does not answer this question.&lt;ref&gt;p.5, Defoort, Carine, and Ge Zhaoguang. "Editors' Introduction." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it does help shape the direction for the future of Chinese thought.  The acceptance of Chinese thought as a philosophy will only occur if this new field can deepen understanding of fundamental philosophical problems outside of its cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;p.20, Zheng, Jiadong. "The Issue of the “Legitimacy” of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final Analysis and Possible Solutions==
As a result of this debate, it has been suggested that the legitimacy of Western philosophy must also be considered anew.  It is only logical that if there is an examination of Chinese thought by the standards of Western philosophy, there must be a reciprocal examination as well.&lt;ref&gt;p.21, Zheng, Jiadong. "The Issue of the “Legitimacy” of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, just as the argument goes that Chinese thought cannot be made to fit to the standards of Western philosophy, the reverse is as true.&lt;ref&gt;p.71, Qiao, Qingju. "Western Discourse and Shadows in the Legitimacy Crisis of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another solution proposed is the introduction of more methodologies in order to have more philosophical interpretations to replace the uniform approaches of the 20th century.  Since Chinese and Western philosophies are different forms of philosophy, it follows that the two should have distinct forms of expression.&lt;ref&gt;p.86, Gan, Chunsong. "Changing from Choice of Methods to Question Awareness: An Interpretation of the Question of the “Legitimacy of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, China has not had one solitary mode of expression through its history of philosophy.  There has been a range in the subjects discussed and the means of discussion.  Therein lies a primary difference of Chinese philosophy: its value does not lie in the organization of its thinking, but rather whether it can answer significantly the issues of the times.&lt;ref&gt;p.87, Gan, Chunsong. "Changing from Choice of Methods to Question Awareness: An Interpretation of the Question of the “Legitimacy of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A history of Chinese philosophy may as well coexist alongside a history of Chinese thought.  While Chinese philosophy would remain the particular Chinese ideas that coincide with Western philosophies, Chinese thought would retain the wider spectrum of general knowledge, thoughts, and beliefs that are more applicable in a societal setting and which are included in classical Chinese texts.&lt;ref&gt;p.47, Ge, Zhaoguang. "Why Is It the “History of Thought”?: Reflections on the “Chinese Philosophy” Issue." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A return to the traditional form of Chinese learning seems implausible at this time, as Chinese universities have divided their disciplines in the same manner as the West; as a result, philosophic thinking will most likely follow in the Western direction.&lt;ref&gt;p.35, Yu, Xuanmeng. "On the New Round of Comparative Studies of Chinese and Western Philosophical Types." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, a complete rejection of the term “philosophy” concerning Chinese thought would isolate this field from Western contemporaries making it irrelevant.  Instead, much emphasis has been placed on the special nature of Chinese philosophy in an attempt to highlight the inherent differences.&lt;ref&gt;p.84, Gan, Chunsong. "Changing from Choice of Methods to Question Awareness: An Interpretation of the Question of the “Legitimacy of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another solution is to consider all research done thus far on the history of Chinese philosophy as [[comparative research]].  Such studies are beneficial in that they allow new perspectives and reveal the unique characteristics of each type of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;p.72, Qiao, Qingju. "Western Discourse and Shadows in the Legitimacy Crisis of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yu Xuanmeng advocates a new structure for comparative study between Western and Chinese philosophy that grants them both the presence of [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], though through different means.  The Western definition of transcendental means a property-transcending-experience.  He reasons that the extension of life in time – that is, the conscious choices made by man of how to involve himself with the world after he examines himself – is also a type of transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;p.39, Yu, Xuanmeng. "On the New Round of Comparative Studies of Chinese and Western Philosophical Types." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.3 (2006). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument over the legitimacy of Chinese philosophy and the use of the term should not be of higher priority than an extensive study of traditional Chinese thought for the knowledge and understanding of how to solve contemporary societal issues in a global community.&lt;ref&gt;p.21, Zheng, Jiadong. "The Issue of the “Legitimacy” of Chinese Philosophy." Contemporary Chinese Thought 37.1 (2005). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lotsawa''' ({{bo|t=ལོ་ཙཱ་བ|w=lo tsA ba}}) is a [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] word used as a title to refer to the native Tibetan translators, such as [[Vairotsana]], [[Rinchen Zangpo]], [[Marpa Lotsawa]], [[Tropu Lotsawa Jampa Pel]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Tropu-Lots%C4%81wa-Jampa-Pel/TBRC_P4007|title=Tropu Lotsawa Jampa Pel|work=The Treasury of Lives|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, who worked alongside Indian scholars or [[pandita (Buddhism)|pandita]]s to translate [[Buddhist texts]] into Tibetan from [[Sanskrit]], [[Classical Chinese]] and other Asian languages.

'''Moon magic''' is associated with the [[moon]]. There is a belief common to many cultures that working [[ritual]]s at the time of different [[Lunar phase|phases of the moon]] can bring about physical or psychological change or transformation. These rituals have historically occurred on or around the [[full moon]] and to a lesser extent the [[new moon]]. Such practices are common amongst adherents of [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] and [[witchcraft]] systems such as [[Wicca]]. Witches in Greek and Roman literature, particularly those from [[Thessaly]], were regularly accused of "drawing down the moon" by use of a magic spell. The trick serves to demonstrate their powers ([[Virgil]] ''Eclogues'' 8.69), to perform a love spell ([[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]] ''Tiberius'' 1.8.21) or to extract a magical juice from the moon ([[Apuleius]] ''Metamorphoses'' 1.3.1).  These beliefs would seem to be consistent with many other cultures traditions, for instance; casting of the i ching is often done during the full moon's apex.

It is common in both [[politics]] and [[public relations]].

Saying "I'm sorry you feel that way" to someone who has been offended by a statement is a non-apology apology. It does not admit there was anything wrong with the remarks made, and may imply the person took offense for hypersensitive or irrational reasons. Another form of non-apology does not apologize directly to the injured or insulted party, but generically "to anyone who might have been offended".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/elisadoucette/2014/11/30/the-art-of-apologies-and-why-elizabeth-lauten-failed-miserably-at-hers/|title=The Art Of Online Apologies And Why Elizabeth Lauten Failed Miserably At Hers|last=Doucette|first=Elisa|date=November 30, 2014|work=Forbes|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statements that use the word "sorry" but do not express responsibility for wrongdoing may be meaningful expressions of regret, but such statements can also be used to elicit forgiveness without acknowledging fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lazare|first=Aaron|title=On Apology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P9iADDrEI_AC|accessdate=3 October 2012|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518911-7|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In November 2008, the Alberta legislature passed an amendment to the existing Alberta Evidence Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. A-18, geared at protecting apologizing parties from risks of legal liability and loss of insurance coverage. Section 26.1 of the Act provides that an apology does not constitute an express or implied admission of fault or liability.&lt;ref name="Curial2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.millerthomson.com/assets/files/article_attachments/Please%20Don't%20Sue%20Me.pdf | publisher=Miller Thomson | date=3 June 2010 | accessdate=26 February 2014 | first1=Brian | last1=Curial | title=I'm Sorry (Please Don't Sue Me) | last2=Chau | first2=Maria | last3=Thomson | first3=Miller | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

=== "Mistakes were made" ===
The expression "[[mistakes were made]]" is commonly used as a [[rhetorical device]], whereby a speaker acknowledges a situation was handled poorly or inappropriately but seeks to evade any direct admission or accusation of responsibility by using the [[passive voice]]. The acknowledgement of "mistakes" is framed in an abstract sense with no direct reference to ''who'' made the mistakes. An [[active voice]] construction would be along the lines of "I made mistakes" or "John Doe made mistakes." The speaker neither accepts personal responsibility nor accuses anyone else. The word "mistakes" also does not imply [[intent (law)|intent]].

''[[The New York Times]]'' has called the phrase a "classic [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] [[Linguistics|linguistic]] construct". Political consultant [[Bill Schneider (journalist)|William Schneider]] suggested this usage be referred to as the "past exonerative" tense,&lt;ref name="broder"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/washington/14mistakes.html | title=Familiar Fallback for Officials: 'Mistakes Were Made' | work=The New York Times | date=13 March 2007 | accessdate=2007-03-20 | author=Broder, John M. | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commentator [[William Safire]] has defined the phrase as "[a] passive-evasive way of acknowledging error while distancing the speaker from responsibility for it".&lt;ref name="Safire"&gt;{{cite book | title=Safire's Political Dictionary | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Safire, William | authorlink=William Safire | year=2008 | isbn=9780195343342 | page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commentator at [[NPR]] declared this expression to be "the king of non-apologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/05/14/183924858/its-true-mistakes-were-made-is-the-king-of-non-apologies|title=It's True: 'Mistakes Were Made' Is The King Of Non-Apologies|last=Memmot|first=Mark|date=May 14, 2013|work=NPR|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While perhaps most famous in politics, the phrase has also been used in business, sports, and entertainment.

===Ifpology===
Attorney and business ethics expert Lauren Bloom, author of ''The Art of the Apology'', mentions the "if apology" as a favorite of politicians, with lines such as "I apologize if I offended anyone".  Comedian [[Harry Shearer]] has coined the term '''Ifpology''' for its frequent appearances on "The Apologies of the Week" segment of ''[[Le Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://techmagazine-821469-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/129608125739/2015-will-be-a-year-of-apologies-maybe-yours | title=2015 Will Be a Year of Apologies. Maybe Yours. | work=Yahoo Tech | date=January 1, 2015 | accessdate=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first references was in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' by Richard Mooney in his 1992 editorial notebook "If This Sounds Slippery ... How to Apologize And Admit Nothing". This was mainly in regard to Senator [[Bob Packwood]]: "Only in the event that someone should choose to take offense, why then he's sorry". Mooney goes on to cite [[Bill Clinton]], who said of [[Mario Cuomo]]: "If the remarks on the tape left anyone with the impression that I was disrespectful to either Governor Cuomo or Italian-Americans, then I deeply regret it." A famous example involved racially insensitive remarks made by golfer [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] about [[Tiger Woods]]; Zoeller's comments and his half-hearted ifpology were news for days and resulted in his being dropped from a commercial tie-in with [[K-Mart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Battistella|first=Edwin L.|title=Sorry about That: The Language of Public Apology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iYY3AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22if+I+offended%22+apology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZSTDU8CoJseAoQSC84DoBg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22if%20I%20offended%22%20apology&amp;f=false|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-930091-4|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Kador in ''Effective Apology'', "Adding the word ''if'' or any other conditional modifier to an apology makes it a non-apology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kador|first=John|title=Effective Apology: Mending Fences, Building Bridges, and Restoring Trust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJ4gQAyfzTUC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=%22if+I+offended%22+apology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZSTDU8CoJseAoQSC84DoBg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22if%20I%20offended%22%20apology&amp;f=false|year=2009|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57675-901-1|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 ifpology was made by ''CNN''{{'}}s [[Don Lemon]], who said, "If my question to her struck anyone as offensive, I am sorry, as that certainly was not my intention." This was in reference to his interview with [[Joan Tarshis]] where he suggested biting a penis as a way to avoid being orally sexually assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Catherine|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/don-lemon-joan-tarshis-bill-cosby-rape|title=CNN Host To Accuser: Why Didn't You Bite Cosby's Penis To End Rape?|publisher=Talking Points Memo|date=November 19, 2014|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2015, [[Matt Damon]] made what ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' termed a "non-apology" apology when he said, "I am sorry that they [his comments] offended some people, but, at the very least, I am happy that they started a conversation about diversity in Hollywood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Paula Young|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/09/17/matt_damon_is_sorry_if_youre_offended_how_the_righteous_non_apology_of_socrates_became_the_tool_of_weasely_pr/|title=Matt Damon is sorry if you're offended: How the righteous non-apology of Socrates became the tool of weasely PR|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=September 17, 2015|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in reference to the backlash against Damon after he made comments about diversity to African American film producer [[Effie Brown]] on the September 13, 2015 debut of the HBO show ''[[Project Greenlight]]'' that were criticized as condescending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosen|first1=Christopher|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/16/matt-damon-project-greenlight-apology|title=Matt Damon apologizes for Project Greenlight diversity comments|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other versions===
On July 24, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported Australian foreign minister Gareth Evans had offered the prime minister of Malaysia "what might best be described as a non-apology apology" for what the Malaysian government regarded as an insulting portrayal of Malaysia in an Australian television series, [[Embassy (TV series)|''Embassy'']].&lt;ref name="Shenon"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/24/world/cliffhanger-down-under-a-soap-opera-huff.html | title=Cliffhanger Down Under: A Soap Opera Huff | work=The New York Times | date=24 July 1991 | accessdate=26 February 2014 | author=Shenon, Philip | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to journalists, Mr Evans said he had "wanted to acknowledge fault where such acknowledgment is appropriate".

=== Sarcastic examples ===
Humorist Bruce McCall, in a 2001 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' piece entitled "The Perfect Non-apology Apology", defined the term as referring to "sufficiently artful [[doublespeak|double talk]]" designed to enable one to "get what you want by seeming to express regret while actually accepting no blame," and suggested some [[tongue-in-cheek]] apologies, such as:

{{quote|Nobody is sorrier than me that the police officer had to spend his valuable time writing out a parking ticket on my car. Though from my personal standpoint I know for a certainty that the meter had not yet expired, please accept my expression of deep regret at this unfortunate incident.&lt;ref name="McCall"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/22/weekinreview/the-perfect-non-apology-apology.html | title=The Perfect Non-Apology Apology | work=The New York Times | date=22 April 2002 | accessdate=26 February 2014 | author=McCall, Bruce | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==As a tactic==

Typologies of apology note they cover a range of situations and degrees of regret, remorse, and contrition, and that success is to be gauged by the result of the apology rather than the degree of contrition involved. Deborah Levi offers the following possibilities:&lt;ref name="Grigsby"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.aamc.org/download/164762/data/grigsby_fine_art_of_apology.pdf | title=The Fine Art of Apology: When, Why, and How to Say ‘I’m Sorry’ | author=Grigsby, R. Kevin | journal=International Journal of Healthcare &amp; Humanities |date=June 2007  | pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Tactical apology—when a person accused of wrongdoing offers an apology that is rhetorical and strategic—and not necessarily heartfelt
* Explanation apology—when a person accused of wrongdoing offers an apology that is merely a gesture that is meant to counter an accusation of wrongdoing. In fact, it may be used to defend the actions of the accused 
* Formalistic apology—when a person accused of wrongdoing offers an apology after being admonished to do so by an authority figure—who may also be the individual who suffered the wrongdoing
* Happy ending apology—when a person accused of wrongdoing fully acknowledges responsibility for the wrongdoing and is genuinely remorseful

While the non-apology apology is clearly unsuited to situations where an expression of remorse, contrition, and future change are obviously desirable (e.g. the "happy ending" apology), it may prove extremely useful in situations where little can be done to assuage the apparent offence or prevent its repetition, as when an airline apologises for a delay, in the full knowledge that a future repetition is inevitable. Such tactical apologies may have beneficial effects simply through the validation of the emotions of the offended party: they answer the basic human need for disagreeable emotions to be recognised and acknowledged as important, while protecting the apparently offending party from an expression of remorse.&lt;ref name="Winch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201106/the-antidote-anger-and-frustration | title=The Antidote to Anger and Frustration | work=Psychology Today | date=18 June 2011 | accessdate=2012-07-18 | author=Winch, Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiators often use this tactic to calm tense situations: "an apology can defuse emotions effectively, even when you do not acknowledge personal responsibility for the action or admit an intention to harm. An apology may be one of the least costly and most rewarding investments you can make."&lt;ref name="Fisher&amp;Ury"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Roger | last1=Fisher | title=[[Getting to YES|Getting to YES: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In]] | publisher=Penguin Book | last2=Ury | first2=William L. | location=New York | isbn=9780140157352 | oclc=24318769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Panayot Butchvarov''' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: Панайот Бъчваров; born April 2, 1933, in [[Sofia]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]) is  Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of Iowa.

==Career==
Butchvarov left Syracuse University in 1968 as a full professor to move to the [[University of Iowa]], where he was at the time of his retirement in 2005 the University of Iowa Foundation [[Distinguished Professor]] of Philosophy. He was President of the American Philosophical Association (Central Division) in 1992-93, and has served as editor of the ''Journal of Philosophical Research.''

Butchvarov has made major, systematic contributions to contemporary [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], and [[ethics]]. His books include ''Resemblance and Identity: An Examination of the Problem of Universals'' (Indiana University Press, 1966), ''The Concept of Knowledge'' (Northwestern University Press, 1970), ''Being Qua Being: A Theory of Identity, Existence and Predication'' (Indiana University Press, 1979), ''Skepticism in Ethics'' (Indiana University Press, 1989), ''Skepticism about the External World'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), and ''Anthropocentrism in Philosophy'' (de Gruyter, 2015). Some of his writings can be found on http://myweb.uiowa.edu/butchvar/ and, more reliably, http://butchvarov.yolasite.com/.

In metaphysics, Butchvarov is perhaps best known for his work on the identity theory of universals and on the nature of informative identity statements (that is, statements of the form ''a=b''—as opposed to instances of the law of identity, that is, statements of the form ''a=a'').  In epistemology, he argues for the view that knowledge is the absolute impossibility of mistake.  In ethics, his central [[Meta-ethics|metaethical]] thesis is that a realist account of [[Good and evil|goodness]] is defensible if goodness is seen as a generic property.

Butchvarov may be said to have been influenced by philosophers as varied as [[Plato]],  [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], Hegel, and [[Wittgenstein]].  The latter's influence can perhaps best be seen in Butchvarov's metaphilosophical Method of Analogy for which he argued in "The Limits of Ontological Analysis" (in M. S. Gram and E. D. Klemke (eds.), ''The Ontological Turn: Studies in the Philosophy of Gustav Bergmann'' (University of Iowa Press, 1974)).  He claims that understanding is most often a matter of coming to see what something is ''like'', seeing what it literally ''is'' being a limiting case, and that it is the noticing, discovery, and grasping of similarities and differences that is the core intellectual achievement in our understanding of the world.

In his most recent work, Butchvarov argues that anthropocentrism in philosophy, though common, is deeply paradoxical. Ethics investigates the human good (including happiness and pleasure), epistemology investigates human knowledge (including perception and conceptualization), and antirealist metaphysics holds that the world depends on our cognitive capacities. But humans' good and knowledge, including their language and concepts, are empirical matters, properly investigated by empirical sciences, not armchair philosophy. And humans are inhabitants, not "makers," of the world. Nevertheless, all three – ethics, epistemology, and antirealist metaphysics – can be reinterpreted as making no reference to humans. Ethics would be confined to the metaphysics of the generic property goodness, epistemology to the appraisal of basic nonformal inferences, and antirealism to the logical structure of the world.

Butchvarov's latest papers are "Commonsense Political Philosophy" and "Afterlife," both available at  http://butchvarov.yolasite.com.

'''Paul Howard Frampton''' (born 31 October 1943) is an English particle [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenologist]]. From 1996 until 2014, he was the Louis D. Rubin, Jr. [[Distinguished Professor]] of physics and astronomy, at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Kidderminster]], England, Frampton attended King Charles I School, 1954–62 and then [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], 1962–68. He received BA ([[Double First]]) in 1965, MA, DPhil in 1968, and DSc in 1984, degrees from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. 

==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2018}}
He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1990) and the American Physical Society (1981). In 1987 he was the project director for siting the [[Superconducting Supercollider]], in [[North Carolina]]. A [[Festschrift]] for his 60th birthday has been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cgc.physics.miami.edu/2003CGC.html|title=La Belle Epoque of High Energy Physics and Cosmology|last=Curtright|first=T.|author2=Mintz, S.|year=2004|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company.|author3=Perlmutter, A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[DPhil]] thesis analyzed the relationship between [[current algebra]] and [[superconvergence]] [[Sum rule in quantum mechanics|sum rules]], and contained a 1967 sum rule. In 1970, he analyzed the absence of [[Ghost (physics)|ghosts]] in the [[dual resonance model]].

Three examples of his model building are the [[chiral color]] model, in 1987, which predicts [[axigluon]]s; the [[331 model]], in 1992, which can explain the number of quark-lepton generations, and predicts [[bilepton]]s; his proposal, in 1995, of the [[binary tetrahedral group]] as a [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavor]] symmetry.  All three serve as targets of opportunity for the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC). In 2002, he built a model relating
matter–antimatter asymmetry in the early universe to measurements possible on Earth. In 2015, he showed that the 331-model predicts long-lived quarks accessible to Run 2 of the LHC.
	
In formal directions, three examples are that he calculated, in 1976, the rate of [[vacuum decay]] in [[quantum field theory]]; in 1982, he analyzed ten-dimensional [[gauge field theory]], and its hexagon anomaly, precursor to the [[first superstring revolution]]; in 1988, he constructed the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] which describes the dynamics of the [[p-adic]] string.
 	
For cosmology, two examples are, in 2007, he built a [[cyclic model]] which can solve a 75-year-old [[entropy]] problem; in 2010, he discussed how [[dark energy]] may be better understood by studying [[temperature]] and entropy. In 2015, he demonstrated how cyclic entropy can lead to
flat geometry without an inflationary era and estimated the time until contraction to be close to one hundred times the present age of the universe.  In 2015 he also proposed a novel theory of dark matter, where the dark matter constituents are primordial black holes with many solar masses.

==Drug smuggling conviction==
In November 2012, Frampton was convicted of [[drug smuggling]] in [[Argentina]] and was sentenced to four years and eight months in detention.&lt;ref name='PhysicsWorld'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2012/nov/22/paul-frampton-hit-by-56-month-drugs-sentence | title = Paul Frampton hit by 56-month drugs sentence | accessdate = 2013-04-02 | last = Banks | first = Michael | date = 22 Nov 2012 | work = [[Physics World]] | publisher = [[Institute of Physics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He denied the charges and said that he was a victim of a [[Romance scam|scam]] wherein an impostor of an internationally known model on a dating website tricked him into [[Mule (smuggling)|transporting]] two kilos of cocaine hidden in the liner fabric of a suitcase.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/magazine/the-professor-the-bikini-model-and-the-suitcase-full-of-trouble.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=The Professor, the Bikini Model and the Suitcase Full of Trouble|last=Swann|first=Maxine|authorlink=Maxine Swann|date=March 8, 2013|work=New York Times|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Nihongo|'''Philosopher's Walk'''|哲学の道|Tetsugaku-no-michi|lit. Path of Philosophy}} is a pedestrian path that follows a [[cherry tree|cherry-tree]]-lined canal in [[Kyoto]], between [[Ginkaku-ji]] and [[Nanzen-ji]]. The route is so-named because the influential 20th-century Japanese philosopher and [[Kyoto University]]  professor [[Nishida Kitaro]] is thought to have used it for daily meditation. It passes a number of temples and shrines such as [[Hōnen-in]], [[Ōtoyo Shrine]], and [[Eikan-dō Zenrin-ji]]. It takes about 30 minutes to complete the walk, although many people spend more time visiting the sights along the way. On the northern part of the walk, there are good views of the nearby [[Daimonji]]. The walk is a popular destination for tourists and locals, especially during [[hanami]].

'''Poetry''' (the term derives from a variant of the [[Greek language|Greek]] term, ''[[poiesis]]'', "making") is a form of [[literature]]  that uses [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] and rhythmic&lt;!-- Please discuss on talk page before removing or altering this word. Dictionary definitions of "poetry" tend to include, in addition to the aesthetic quality of poetry, a structural/rhythmical/metrical quality as well. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/poetry?q=poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|year=2013|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry|work=Dictionary.com|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC|year=2013|postscript=—Based on the Random House Dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/poetry?s=t}}&lt;/ref&gt; qualities of [[language]]—such as [[phonaesthetics]], [[sound symbolism]], and [[metre (poetry)|metre]]—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the [[Prose|prosaic]] ostensible [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].

Poetry has a long [[history of poetry|history]], dating back to prehistorical times with the creation of hunting poetry in Africa, and panegyric and elegiac court poetry were developed extensively throughout the history of the empires of the Nile, Niger and Volta river valleys &lt;ref&gt; Oral Literature in Africa, Ruth Finnegan, Open Book Publishers, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;. Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa can be found among the [[Pyramid Texts]] written during the 25th century BCE, while the [[Epic of Sundiata]] is one of the most well-known examples of [[griot]] court poetry. The earliest Western Asian epic poetry, the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', was written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]].  Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shijing]]'', or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit]] ''[[Vedas]]'', [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ''[[Gathas]]'', and the [[Homer]]ic epics, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry, such as [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', focused on the uses of [[Speech communication|speech]] in [[rhetoric]], [[drama]], [[song]] and [[comedy]]. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, [[line (poetry)|verse form]] and [[rhyme]], and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively informative, [[prose|prosaic]] forms of writing.

Poetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as [[assonance]], [[alliteration]], [[onomatopoeia]] and [[rhythm]] are sometimes used to achieve [[music]]al or [[incantation|incantatory]] effects. The use of [[ambiguity]], [[symbol]]ism, [[irony]] and other [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistic]] elements of [[poetic diction]] often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly figures of speech such as [[metaphor]], [[simile]] and [[metonymy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Strachan, John R|author2=Terry, Richard, G|isbn=978-0814797976|title=Poetry: an introduction|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2000|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual [[Verse (poetry)|verses]], in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.

Some poetry types are specific to particular [[culture]]s and [[genre]]s and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]] and [[Rumi]] may think of it as written in [[Line (poetry)|lines]] based on [[rhyme]] and regular [[meter (poetry)|meter]]; there are, however, traditions, such as [[Biblical poetry]], that use other means to create rhythm and [[euphony]]. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eliot, TS|chapter=The Function of Criticism|title=Selected Essays|isbn=978-0151803873|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|year=1999|pages=13–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Longenbach, James|title=Modern Poetry After Modernism|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195101782|year=1997|pages=9, 103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=xxvii–xxxiii|editor=Schmidt, Michael|title=The Harvill Book of Twentieth-Century Poetry in English|publisher=Harvill Press|year=1999|isbn=1860467350}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's increasingly [[globalization|globalized]] world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.

Some scholars believe that the art of poetry may predate [[literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoivik|first=S|author2=Luger, K|title=Folk Media for Biodiversity Conservation: A Pilot Project from the Himalaya-Hindu Kush|journal=International Communication Gazette|date=3 June 2009|volume=71|issue=4|pages=321–346|doi=10.1177/1748048509102184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, however, suggest that poetry did not necessarily predate writing.&lt;ref name="Goody, Jack 1987 98"&gt;{{cite book|author=Goody, Jack|title=The Interface Between the Written and the Oral|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|page=98|isbn=0521337941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest surviving [[epic poetry|epic poem]], the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', comes from the 3rd millennium{{nbsp}}BCE in [[Sumer]] (in [[Mesopotamia]], now [[Iraq]]), and was written in [[cuneiform script]] on clay tablets and, later, on [[papyrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sanders, NK (trans.)|title=The Epic of Gilgamesh|publisher=Penguin Books|edition=Revised|year=1972|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tablet dating to c.{{nbsp}}2000{{nbsp}}BCE describes an annual rite in which the king [[sacred marriage|symbolically married]] and mated with the goddess [[Inanna]] to ensure fertility and prosperity; it is considered the world's oldest love poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/article/750/|title=

[[File:Manuscript from Shanghai Museum 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|An early Chinese [[poetics]], the ''Kǒngzǐ Shīlùn'' (孔子詩論), discussing the ''[[Shijing]]'' (''Classic of Poetry'')]]
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aristotle]]]]
Other ancient [[epic poetry]] includes the [[Greek language|Greek]] epics, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''Odyssey''; the [[Avestan language|Avestan]] books, the ''[[Gathas|Gathic Avesta]]'' and the ''[[Yasna]]''; the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[national epic]], [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''; and the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]], the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.  Epic poetry, including the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the ''[[Gathas]]'', and the [[Vedic period|Indian]] ''[[Vedas]]'', appears to have been composed in poetic form as an aid to memorization and oral transmission, in prehistoric and ancient societies.&lt;ref name="Goody, Jack 1987 98"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ahl, Frederick |author2=Roisman, Hannah M |title=The Odyssey Re-Formed|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1996|pages=1–26|isbn=0801483352}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of poetry developed directly from folk songs. The earliest entries in the oldest extant collection of [[Chinese poetry]], the  ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shijing]]'', were initially lyrics.&lt;ref name="Ebrey"&gt;{{cite book|first=Patricia|last=Ebrey|year=1993|title=Chinese Civilisation: A Sourcebook|edition=2nd|publisher=The Free Press|isbn=978-0029087527|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts of ancient thinkers to determine what makes poetry distinctive as a form, and what distinguishes good poetry from bad, resulted in "[[poetics]]"—the study of the aesthetics of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abondolo|first=Daniel|title=A poetics handbook: verbal art in the European tradition|year=2001|publisher=Curzon|isbn=9780700712236|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient societies, such as China's through her ''[[Shijing]]'' (''Classic of Poetry''), developed canons of poetic works that had ritual as well as aesthetic importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gentz, Joachim|title=Text and Ritual in Early China|chapter=Ritual Meaning of Textual Form: Evidence from Early Commentaries of the Historiographic and Ritual Traditions|editor=Kern, Martin|pages=124–48|isbn=978-0295987873|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, thinkers have struggled to find a definition that could encompass formal differences as great as those between Chaucer's ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' and [[Matsuo Bashō]]'s ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'', as well as differences in content spanning [[Tanakh]] [[Biblical poetry|religious poetry]], love poetry, and [[rapping|rap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=607–09, 620|title=A history of literary criticism|author=Habib, Rafey|isbn=978-0631232001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western traditions ===

Classical thinkers employed classification as a way to define and assess the quality of poetry. Notably, the existing fragments of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' describe three genres of poetry—the epic, the comic, and the tragic—and develop rules to distinguish the highest-quality poetry in each genre, based on the underlying purposes of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Heath, Malcolm|title=Aristotle's ''Poetics''|publisher=Penguin Books |year=1997|isbn=0140446362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Aesthetics|aestheticians]] identified three major genres: epic poetry, [[lyric poetry]], and [[dramatic poetry]], treating [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]] as [[Genre|subgenres]] of dramatic poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frow|first=John|title=Genre|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415280631|pages=57–59|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's work was influential throughout the Middle East during the [[Islamic Golden Age]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bogges, WF |title='Hermannus Alemannus' Latin Anthology of Arabic Poetry |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |year=1968 |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=657–70 |doi=10.2307/598112 |jstor=598112}} {{cite book |author=Burnett, Charles |chapter= Learned Knowledge of Arabic Poetry, Rhymed Prose, and Didactic Verse from Petrus Alfonsi to Petrarch |title=Poetry and Philosophy in the Middle Ages: A Festschrift for Peter Dronke |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |year=2001 |isbn=9004119647 |pages=29–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in Europe during the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grendler, Paul F |title=The Universities of the Italian Renaissance |publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0801880556 |page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later poets and aestheticians often distinguished poetry from, and defined it in opposition to [[prose]], which was generally understood as writing with a proclivity to logical explication and a linear narrative structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kant, Immanuel; Bernard, JH (trans.)|title=Critique of Judgment |publisher=Macmillan|year=1914|page=131}} Kant argues that the nature of poetry as a self-consciously abstract and beautiful form raises it to the highest level among the verbal arts, with tone or music following it, and only after that the more logical and narrative prose.&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not imply that poetry is illogical or lacks narration, but rather that poetry is an attempt to render the beautiful or sublime without the burden of engaging the logical or narrative thought process. English [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poet [[John Keats]] termed this escape from logic "[[Negative Capability]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ou |first=Li |title=Keats and negative capability |year=2009 |publisher= Continuum |isbn=978-1441147240 |pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "romantic" approach views form as a key element of successful poetry because form is abstract and distinct from the underlying notional logic. This approach remained influential into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watten |first=Barrett |title= The constructivist moment: from material text to cultural poetics |year=2003 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |isbn=978-0819566102|pages=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, there was also substantially more interaction among the various poetic traditions, in part due to the spread of European [[colonialism]] and the attendant rise in global trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abu-Mahfouz, Ahmad |title=Translation as a Blending of Cultures |journal=Journal of Translation |volume=4 |issue=1 |year=2008 |url= http://pnglanguages.org/siljot/2008/1/51140/siljot2008-1-01.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120309034908/http://pnglanguages.org/siljot/2008/1/51140/siljot2008-1-01.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a boom in [[translation]], during the Romantic period numerous ancient works were rediscovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Highet |first=Gilbert |title=The classical tradition: Greek and Roman influences on western literature |year=1985 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195002065 |pages=355, 360, 479 |edition=Reissued}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th-century and 21st-century disputes ===
[[File:Archibaldmacleish.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Archibald MacLeish]]]]
Some 20th-century [[Literary theory|literary theorists]], relying less on the opposition of prose and poetry, focused on the poet as simply one who creates using language, and poetry as what the poet creates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wimsatt, William K, Jr |author2=Brooks, Cleanth |title=Literary Criticism: A Short History|publisher=Vintage Books|year=1957|page=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying concept of the poet as creator is not uncommon, and some [[modernist poetry|modernist poets]] essentially do not distinguish between the creation of a poem with words, and creative acts in other media. Yet other modernists challenge the very attempt to define poetry as misguided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Jeannine|title=Why write poetry?: modern poets defending their art|year=2007|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|isbn=978-0838641057|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rejection of traditional forms and structures for poetry that began in the first half of the 20th century coincided with a questioning of the purpose and meaning of traditional definitions of poetry and of distinctions between poetry and prose, particularly given examples of poetic prose and prosaic poetry. Numerous modernist poets have written in non-traditional forms or in what traditionally would have been considered prose, although their writing was generally infused with poetic diction and often with rhythm and tone established by non-[[Meter (poetry)|metrical]] means. While there was a substantial [[New Formalism|formalist]] reaction within the modernist schools to the breakdown of structure, this reaction focused as much on the development of new formal structures and syntheses as on the revival of older forms and structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Jenkins, Lee M; Davis, Alex|title=The Cambridge companion to modernist poetry|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521618151|pages=1–7, 38, 156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, [[postmodernism]] has come to convey more completely prose and poetry as distinct entities, and also among genres of poetry, as having meaning only as cultural artifacts. Postmodernism goes beyond modernism's emphasis on the creative role of the poet, to emphasize the role of the reader of a text ([[Hermeneutics]]), and to highlight the complex cultural web within which a poem is read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Roland Barthes|Barthes, Roland]]|chapter=[[Death of the author|Death of the Author]]|title=Image-Music-Text|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|year=1978|pages=142–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, throughout the world, poetry often incorporates poetic form and diction from other cultures and from the past, further confounding attempts at definition and classification that were once sensible within a tradition such as the [[Western canon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Connor|first=Steven|title=Postmodernist culture: an introduction to theories of the contemporary|year=1997|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-0631200529|pages=123–28|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 21st century poetic tradition appears to continue to strongly orient itself to earlier precursor poetic traditions such as those initiated by Whitman, Emerson, and Wordsworth. The literary critic [[Geoffrey Hartman]] has used the phrase "the anxiety of demand" to describe contemporary response to older poetic traditions as "being fearful that the fact no longer has a form", building on a trope introduced by Emerson. Emerson had maintained that in the debate concerning poetic structure where either "form" or "fact" could predominate, that one need simply "Ask the fact for the form." This has been challenged at various levels by other literary scholars such as [[Harold Bloom|Bloom]] who has stated in summary form concerning the early 21st century that: "The generation of poets who stand together now, mature and ready to write the major American verse of the twenty-first century, may yet be seen as what Stevens called 'a great shadow's last embellishment,' the shadow being Emerson's."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold (2006).

== Elements ==

=== Prosody ===
{{Main article|Meter (poetry)}}
Prosody is the study of the meter, [[rhythm]], and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] of a poem. Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pinsky|1998|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as [[iambic pentameter]]), while rhythm is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. Prosody also may be used more specifically to refer to the [[scansion|scanning]] of poetic lines to show meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rhythm ====
{{Main article|Timing (linguistics)|tone (linguistics)|Pitch accent}}
[[File:Robinsonjeffers.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Robinson Jeffers]]]]

The methods for creating poetic rhythm vary across languages and between poetic traditions. Languages are often described as having timing set primarily by [[stress-timed language|accents]], [[syllable-timed language|syllables]], or [[mora-timed language|moras]], depending on how rhythm is established, though a language can be influenced by multiple approaches. [[Japanese Language|Japanese]] is a [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]-timed language. [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[French language|French]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are called syllable-timed languages. Stress-timed languages include [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and, generally, [[German language|German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schülter, Julia|title=Rhythmic Grammar|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2005|pages=24, 304, 332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varying [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] also affects how rhythm is perceived. Languages can rely on either pitch or tone. Some languages with a pitch accent are Vedic Sanskrit or Ancient Greek. [[Tonal language]]s include Chinese, Vietnamese and most [[Niger–Congo languages|Subsaharan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yip, Moira|title=Tone|series=Cambridge textbooks in linguistics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521773148|pages=1–4, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called [[foot (prosody)|feet]] within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or [[elision|elided]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[classical languages]], on the other hand, while the [[Meter (music)|metrical]] units are similar, [[vowel length]] rather than stresses define the meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jorgens|first=Elise Bickford|title=The well-tun'd word : musical interpretations of English poetry, 1597–1651|year=1982|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0816610297|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old English]] poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Marianne Moore 1935.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Marianne Moore]]]]
The chief device of ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Biblical poetry]], including many of the [[psalms]], was ''[[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]'', a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to [[antiphon]]al or [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] performance, which could also be reinforced by [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker-Jones|first=Arthur|title=Hebrew for biblical interpretation|year=2003|publisher=Society of Biblical Literature|isbn=978-1589830868|pages=211–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some classical poetry forms, such as [[Venpa]] of the [[Tamil language]], had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a [[context-free grammar]]) which ensured a rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bala Sundara Raman|first=L|author2=Ishwar, S|author3= Kumar Ravindranath, Sanjeeth|title=Context Free Grammar for Natural Language Constructs: An implementation for Venpa Class of Tamil Poetry|journal=Tamil Internet|year=2003|pages=128–36|doi=|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.3.7738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shi (poetry)|Classical Chinese poetics]], based on the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|tone system of Middle Chinese]], recognized two kinds of tones: the level (平 ''píng'') tone and the oblique (仄 ''zè'') tones, a category consisting of the rising (上 ''sháng'') tone, the departing (去 ''qù'') tone and the entering (入 ''rù'') tone. Certain forms of poetry placed contraints on which syllables were required to be level and which oblique.

The formal patterns of meter used in Modern English verse to create rhythm no longer dominate contemporary English poetry. In the case of [[free verse]], rhythm is often organized based on looser units of [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]] rather than a regular meter. [[Robinson Jeffers]], [[Marianne Moore]], and [[William Carlos Williams]] are three notable poets who reject the idea that regular accentual meter is critical to English poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hartman|first=Charles O|title=Free Verse An Essay on Prosody|year=1980|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=978-0810113169|pages=24, 44, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffers experimented with [[sprung rhythm]] as an alternative to accentual rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hollander|1981|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Systems of scansion}}
In the Western poetic tradition, meters are customarily grouped according to a characteristic [[metrical foot]] and the number of feet per line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of metrical feet in a line are described using Greek terminology: [[tetrameter]] for four feet and [[hexameter]] for six feet, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=25, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "[[iambic pentameter]]" is a meter comprising five feet per line, in which the predominant kind of foot is the "[[Iamb (foot)|iamb]]". This metric system originated in ancient [[Greek poetry]], and was used by poets such as [[Pindar]] and [[Sappho]], and by the great [[Tragedy|tragedians]] of [[Athens]]. Similarly, "[[dactylic hexameter]]", comprises six feet per line, of which the dominant kind of foot is the "[[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]]". Dactylic hexameter was the traditional meter of Greek [[epic poetry]], the earliest extant examples of which are the works of [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref name=greek&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Aoidoi|title=Introduction to Greek Meter|date=January 2006|author=Annis, William S|pages=1–15|url=http://aoidoi.org/articles/meter/intro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iambic pentameter and dactylic hexameter were later used by a number of poets, including [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unibl.eu/pdf/examples_metrical_systems.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308211254/http://www.unibl.eu/pdf/examples_metrical_systems.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 March 2012 |accessdate=10 December 2011 |title=Examples of English metrical systems |publisher=Fondazione Universitaria in provincia di Belluno }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common metrical feet in English are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Iamb (foot)|iamb]] – one unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable (e.g. des-'''cribe''', in-'''clude''', re-'''tract''')
* [[trochee]] – one stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable (e.g. '''pic'''-ture, '''flow'''-er)
* [[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]] – one stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables (e.g. '''an'''-no-tate, '''sim'''-i-lar)
* [[anapest]] – two unstressed syllables followed by one stressed syllable (e.g. com-pre-'''hend''')
* [[spondee]] – two stressed syllables together (e.g. '''heart'''-'''beat''', '''four'''-'''teen''')
* [[pyrrhic]] – two unstressed syllables together (rare, usually used to end dactylic hexameter)

There are a wide range of names for other types of feet, right up to a [[choriamb]], a four syllable metric foot with a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables and closing with a stressed syllable. The choriamb is derived from some ancient [[Greek poetry|Greek]] and [[Latin poetry]].&lt;ref name=greek/&gt; Languages which utilize [[vowel length]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] rather than or in addition to syllabic accents in determining meter, such as [[Meter (poetry)#Ottoman Turkish|Ottoman Turkish]] or [[Vedic meter|Vedic]], often have concepts similar to the iamb and dactyl to describe common combinations of long and short sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kiparsky, Paul|journal=Language|pages=576–616|title=Stress, Syntax, and Meter|date=September 1975|volume=51|issue=3|doi=10.2307/412889|jstor=412889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these types of feet has a certain "feel," whether alone or in combination with other feet. The iamb, for example, is the most natural form of rhythm in the English language, and generally produces a subtle but stable verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thompson, John|title=The Founding of English Meter|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1961|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scanning meter can often show the basic or fundamental pattern underlying a verse, but does not show the varying degrees of [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], as well as the differing pitches and [[vowel length|lengths]] of syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pinsky|1998|pp=11–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate over how useful a multiplicity of different "feet" is in describing meter. For example, [[Robert Pinsky]] has argued that while dactyls are important in classical verse, English dactylic verse uses dactyls very irregularly and can be better described based on patterns of iambs and anapests, feet which he considers natural to the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pinsky|1998|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual rhythm is significantly more complex than the basic scanned meter described above, and many scholars have sought to develop systems that would scan such complexity. [[Vladimir Nabokov]] noted that overlaid on top of the regular pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of verse was a separate pattern of accents resulting from the natural pitch of the spoken words, and suggested that the term "scud" be used to distinguish an unaccented stress from an accented stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nabokov, Vladimir|title=Notes on Prosody|publisher=Bollingen Foundation|year=1964|isbn=978-0691017600|pages=9–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Meter (poetry)}}
Different traditions and genres of poetry tend to use different meters, ranging from the Shakespearean [[iambic pentameter]] and the Homeric [[dactylic hexameter]] to the [[anapestic tetrameter]] used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a [[caesura]] (or pause) may be added (sometimes in place of a foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a [[Meter (poetry)|feminine ending]] to soften it or be replaced by a [[spondee]] to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=36–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, [[iambic tetrameter]] in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nabokov, Vladimir|title=Notes on Prosody|publisher=Bollingen Foundation|year=1964|isbn=0691017603|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rhyme, alliteration, assonance ===
[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Old English]] [[epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' is in [[alliterative]] [[Verse (poetry)|verse]].]]
{{Main article|Rhyme|Alliterative verse|Assonance}}

Rhyme, alliteration, assonance and [[Literary consonance|consonance]] are ways of creating repetitive patterns of sound. They may be used as an independent structural element in a poem,  to reinforce rhythmic patterns, or as an ornamental element.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also carry a meaning separate from the repetitive sound patterns created. For example, [[Chaucer]] used heavy alliteration to mock Old English verse and to paint a character as archaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter='I kan nat geeste': Chaucer's Artful Alliteration|author=Osberg, Richard H|editor=Gaylord, Alan T|title=Essays on the art of Chaucer's verse|isbn=978-0815329510|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|pages=195–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhyme consists of identical ("hard-rhyme") or similar ("soft-rhyme") sounds placed at the ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines ("[[internal rhyme]]"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|author=Alighieri, Dante; Pinsky Robert (trans.)|title=The Inferno of Dante: A New Verse Translation|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|year=1994|isbn=0374176744}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.&lt;ref name=kiparsky&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Daedalus|title=The Role of Linguistics in a Theory of Poetry|author=Kiparsky, Paul|pages=231–44|date=Summer 1973|volume=102|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alliteration is the repetition of letters or letter-sounds at the beginning of two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance played a key role in structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.

Assonance, where the use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the beginning or end of a word, was widely used in [[skald]]ic poetry, but goes back to the Homeric epic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=64–86|title=Beowulf and old Germanic metre|author=Russom, Geoffrey|isbn=978-0521593403|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liu|first=James JY|title=Art of Chinese Poetry|year=1990|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226486871|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.&lt;ref name=kiparsky/&gt;

==== Rhyming schemes ====

{{Main article|Rhyme scheme}}

In many languages, including modern European languages and Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as [[ballad]]s, [[sonnet]]s and [[couplet|rhyming couplets]]. However, the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional [[rhyme scheme]]s. Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not use rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wesling|first=Donald|title=The chances of rhyme|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520038615|pages=x–xi, 38–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhyme entered European poetry in the [[High Middle Ages]], in part under the influence of the [[Arabic language]] in [[Al Andalus]] (modern Spain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=88|author=Menocal, Maria Rosa|title=The Arabic Role in Medieval Literary History|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=2003|isbn=0812213246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the [[6th century in poetry|sixth century]], as in their long, rhyming [[qasida]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= Sperl, Stefan|title=Qasida poetry in Islamic Asia and Africa|year=1996|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004103870|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the [[chant royal]] or the [[Ruba'i|rubaiyat]], while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=71–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most rhyme schemes are described using letters that correspond to sets of rhymes, so if the first, second and fourth lines of a quatrain rhyme with each other and the third line does not rhyme, the quatrain is said to have an "a-a-b-a" rhyme scheme. This rhyme scheme is the one used, for example, in the rubaiyat form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an "a-b-b-a" quatrain (what is known as "[[enclosed rhyme]]") is used in such forms as the [[Petrarchan sonnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=88–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of more complicated rhyming schemes have developed names of their own, separate from the "a-b-c" convention, such as the [[ottava rima]] and [[terza rima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=81–82, 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The types and use of differing rhyming schemes is discussed further in the [[rhyme scheme|main article]].

=== Form in poetry ===
Poetic form is more flexible in modernist and post-modernist poetry, and continues to be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognisable structures or forms, and write in [[free verse]]. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitworth|first=Michael H|title=Reading modernist poetry|year=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1405167314|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hollander|1981|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among major structural elements used in poetry are the line, the [[stanza]] or [[verse paragraph]], and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as [[canto]]s. Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations of words and [[calligraphy]]. These basic units of poetic form are often combined into larger structures, called ''poetic forms'' or poetic modes (see following section), as in the [[sonnet]] or [[haiku]].

==== Lines and stanzas ====
Poetry is often separated into lines on a page. These lines may be based on the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=7–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the article on [[line break (poetry)|line breaks]] for information about the division between lines.

Lines of poems are often organized into [[stanza]]s, which are denominated by the number of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a [[couplet]] (or [[distich]]), three lines a [[tercet|triplet]] (or [[tercet]]), four lines a [[quatrain]], and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexander Blok - Noch, ulica, fonar, apteka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Alexander Blok|Blok]]'s [[Russian language|Russian]] poem, "''Noch, ulitsa, fonar, apteka''" ("Night, street, lamp, drugstore"), on a wall in [[Leiden]]]]

Other poems may be organized into [[verse paragraph]]s, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used, but the poetic tone is instead established by a collection of rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs, even where regular rhymes and rhythms were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Dalrymple, Roger|title=Middle English Literature: a guide to criticism|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=978-0631232902|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many forms of poetry, stanzas are interlocking, so that the rhyming scheme or other structural elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. Examples of such interlocking stanzas include, for example, the [[ghazal]] and the [[villanelle]], where a refrain (or, in the case of the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related to the use of interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts of a poem. For example, the [[strophe]], [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]] of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, particularly lengthier formal poetry such as some forms of epic poetry, stanzas themselves are constructed according to strict rules and then combined. In [[skald]]ic poetry, the [[dróttkvætt]] stanza had eight lines, each having three "lifts" produced with alliteration or assonance. In addition to two or three alliterations, the odd numbered lines had partial rhyme of consonants with dissimilar vowels, not necessarily at the beginning of the word; the even lines contained internal rhyme in set syllables (not necessarily at the end of the word). Each half-line had exactly six syllables, and each line ended in a trochee. The arrangement of dróttkvætts followed far less rigid rules than the construction of the individual dróttkvætts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-1405137386|pages=269–80|editor=McTurk, Rory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Visual presentation ====
[[File:Visual poetry.jpg|thumb|upright=0.35|[[Visual poetry]]]]
{{Main article|Visual poetry}}
Even before the advent of printing, the visual appearance of poetry often added meaning or depth. [[Acrostic]] poems conveyed meanings in the initial letters of lines or in letters at other specific places in a poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Harvard Theological Review|title=Acrostics and Metrics in Hebrew Poetry|author=Freedman, David Noel|volume=65|issue=3|date=July 1972|pages=367–92|doi=10.1017/s0017816000001620}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Arabic poetry|Arabic]], [[Jewish literature#Poetry|Hebrew]] and [[Chinese poetry]], the visual presentation of finely [[calligraphy|calligraphed]] poems has played an important part in the overall effect of many poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kampf|first=Robert|title=Reading the Visual – 17th century poetry and visual culture|year=2010|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3640600113|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[printing]], poets gained greater control over the mass-produced visual presentations of their work. Visual elements have become an important part of the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some [[Modernism|Modernist]] poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this complements the poem's [[rhythm]] through visual [[caesura]]s of various lengths, or creates [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtapositions]] so as to accentuate meaning, [[ambiguity]] or [[irony]], or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form. In its most extreme form, this can lead to [[concrete poetry]] or [[asemic writing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohn|first=Willard|title=The aesthetics of visual poetry|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226063256|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Wired|author=Sterling, Bruce|title=Web Semantics: Asemic writing|date=13 July 2009|url=https://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2009/07/web-semantics-asemic-writing/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027152452/http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2009/07/web-semantics-asemic-writing/|archivedate=2009-10-27|accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diction ===
{{Main article|Poetic diction}}
Poetic diction treats the manner in which language is used, and refers not only to the sound but also to the underlying meaning and its interaction with sound and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barfield|first=Owen|title=Poetic diction: a study in meaning|year=1987|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=978-0819560261|edition=2nd|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many languages and poetic forms have very specific poetic dictions, to the point where distinct [[grammar]]s and [[dialect]]s are used specifically for poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=American Journal of Philology|author=Sheets, George A|title=The Dialect Gloss, Hellenistic Poetics and Livius Andronicus|pages=58–78|volume=102|issue=1|date=Spring 1981|doi=10.2307/294154|jstor=294154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blank|first=Paula|title=Broken English: dialects and the politics of language in Renaissance writings|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415137799|pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Register tone|Registers]] in poetry can range from strict employment of ordinary speech patterns, as favoured in much late-20th-century [[Prosody (poetry)|prosody]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perloff|first=Marjorie|title=21st-century modernism: the new poetics|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|isbn=978-0631219705|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; through to highly ornate uses of language, as in medieval and Renaissance poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval lyric: genres in historical context|year=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0252025365|editor=Paden, William D|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poetic diction can include [[rhetorical device]]s such as [[simile]] and [[metaphor]], as well as tones of voice, such as [[irony]]. [[Aristotle]] wrote in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' that "the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Gutenberg|name=The Poetics of Aristotle|1974}}, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the rise of [[Modernism]], some poets have opted for a poetic diction that de-emphasizes rhetorical devices, attempting instead the direct presentation of things and experiences and the exploration of [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge companion to modernist poetry|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521618151|pages=90–96|editors=Davis, Alex; Jenkins, Lee M}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[surrealism|Surrealists]] have pushed rhetorical devices to their limits, making frequent use of [[catachresis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=San Juan|first=E, Jr|title=Working through the contradictions from cultural theory to critical practice|year=2004|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=978-0838755709|pages=124–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allegory|Allegorical]] stories are central to the poetic diction of many cultures, and were prominent in the West during classical times, the [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'', repeatedly rendered in both verse and prose since first being recorded about 500 BCE, are perhaps the richest single source of allegorical poetry through the ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Treip|first=Mindele Anne|title=Allegorical poetics and the epic: the Renaissance tradition to Paradise Lost|year=1994|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0813118314|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notables examples include the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', a 13th-century French poem, [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Ploughman]]'' in the 14th century, and [[Jean de la Fontaine]]'s ''Fables'' (influenced by Aesop's) in the 17th century. Rather than being fully allegorical, however, a poem may contain [[symbols]] or [[allusion]]s that deepen the meaning or effect of its words without constructing a full allegory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crisp|first=P|title=Allegory and symbol – a fundamental opposition?|journal=Language and Literature|date=1 November 2005|volume=14|issue=4|pages=323–38|doi=10.1177/0963947005051287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another element of poetic diction can be the use of vivid [[imagery (literature)|imagery]] for effect. The juxtaposition of unexpected or impossible images is, for example, a particularly strong element in surrealist poetry and [[haiku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Modern Haiku|volume=35|issue=2|pages=21–44|year=2004|author=Gilbert, Richard|title=The Disjunctive Dragonfly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivid images are often endowed with symbolism or metaphor. Many poetic dictions use repetitive phrases for effect, either a short phrase (such as Homer's "rosy-fingered dawn" or "the wine-dark sea") or a longer [[refrain]]. Such repetition can add a sombre tone to a poem, or can be laced with irony as the context of the words changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hollander|1981|pp=37–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms ==
{{see also|Category:Poetic form}}
Specific poetic forms have been developed by many cultures. In more developed, closed or "received" poetic forms, the rhyming scheme, meter and other elements of a poem are based on sets of rules, ranging from the relatively loose rules that govern the construction of an [[elegy]] to the highly formalized structure of the [[ghazal]] or [[villanelle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=160–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described below are some common forms of poetry widely used across a number of languages. Additional forms of poetry may be found in the discussions of poetry of particular cultures or periods and in the [[Glossary of poetry terms|glossary]].

=== Sonnet ===
[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shakespeare]]]]
{{Main article|Sonnet}}

Among the most common forms of poetry, popular from the [[Late Middle Ages]] on, is the sonnet, which by the 13th century had become standardized as fourteen lines following a set rhyme scheme and logical structure. By the 14th century and the [[Italian Renaissance]], the form had further crystallized under the pen of [[Petrarch]], whose sonnets were translated in the 16th century by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]], who is credited with introducing the sonnet form into English literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; A traditional Italian or [[Petrarchan sonnet]] follows the rhyme scheme ''ABBA, ABBA, CDECDE'', though some variation, perhaps the most common being CDCDCD, especially within the final six lines (or ''sestet''), is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=15–17|title=Petrarch and Petrarchism|author=Minta, Stephen|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1980|isbn=0719007488}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[English sonnet|English (or Shakespearean) sonnet]] follows the rhyme scheme ''ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GG'', introducing a third [[quatrain]] (grouping of four lines), a final [[couplet]], and a greater amount of variety with regard to rhyme than is usually found in its Italian predecessors. By convention, sonnets in English typically use [[iambic pentameter]], while in the [[Romance languages]], the [[hendecasyllable]] and [[Alexandrine]] are the most widely used meters.

Sonnets of all types often make use of a ''volta'', or "turn," a point in the poem at which an idea is turned on its head, a question is answered (or introduced), or the subject matter is further complicated. This ''volta'' can often take the form of a "but" statement contradicting or complicating the content of the earlier lines. In the Petrarchan sonnet, the turn tends to fall around the division between the first two quatrains and the sestet, while English sonnets usually place it at or near the beginning of the closing couplet.
[[File:Carol Ann Duffy (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Carol Ann Duffy]]]]
Sonnets are particularly associated with high poetic diction, vivid imagery, and romantic love, largely due to the influence of Petrarch as well as of early English practitioners such as [[Edmund Spenser]] (who gave his name to the [[Spenserian sonnet]]), [[Michael Drayton]], and Shakespeare, whose [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]] are among the most famous in English poetry, with twenty being included in the ''[[Oxford Book of English Verse]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Quiller-Couch, Arthur|title=[[Oxford Book of English Verse]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the twists and turns associated with the ''volta'' allow for a logical flexibility applicable to many subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=119–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poets from the earliest centuries of the sonnet to the present have utilized the form to address topics related to politics ([[John Milton]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Claude McKay]]), theology ([[John Donne]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]), war ([[Wilfred Owen]], [[e.e. cummings]]), and gender and sexuality ([[Carol Ann Duffy]]). Further, postmodern authors such as [[Ted Berrigan]] and [[John Berryman]] have challenged the traditional definitions of the sonnet form, rendering entire sequences of "sonnets" that often lack rhyme, a clear logical progression, or even a consistent count of fourteen lines.

=== Shi ===
[[File:Dufucalligraphy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Du Fu]], "On Visiting the Temple of [[Laozi]]"]]
{{Main article|Shi (poetry)}}
''Shi'' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:詩|詩]]|s=[[wikt:诗|诗]]|p=shī|w=shih}}) Is the main type of [[Classical Chinese poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971). ''CHINESE LYRICISM: Shih Poetry from the Second to the Twelfth Century''. (New York: Columbia University Press). {{ISBN|0231034644}}, 1&lt;/ref&gt; Within this form of poetry the most important variations are "folk song" styled verse (''[[yuefu]]''), "old style" verse (''[[gushi (poetry)|gushi]]''), "modern style" verse (''[[jintishi]]''). In all cases, rhyming is obligatory. The Yuefu is a folk ballad or a poem written in the folk ballad style, and the number of lines and the length of the lines could be irregular. For the other variations of ''shi'' poetry, generally either a four line (quatrain, or ''[[jueju]]'') or else an eight line poem is normal; either way with the even numbered lines rhyming. The line length is scanned by according number of characters (according to the convention that one character equals one syllable), and are predominantly either five or seven characters long, with a [[caesura]] before the final three syllables. The lines are generally end-stopped, considered as a series of couplets, and exhibit verbal parallelism as a key poetic device.&lt;ref&gt;[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971). ''Chinese Lyricism: Shih Poetry from the Second to the Twelfth Century''. (New York: Columbia University Press). {{ISBN|0231034644}}, 1–2 and 15–18&lt;/ref&gt; The "old style" verse (''gushi'') is less formally strict than the ''jintishi'', or regulated verse, which, despite the name "new style" verse actually had its theoretical basis laid as far back as [[Shen Yue]] (441–513 CE), although not considered to have reached its full development until the time of [[Chen Zi'ang]] (661–702 CE).&lt;ref&gt;[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971). ''Chinese Lyricism: Shih Poetry from the Second to the Twelfth Century''. (New York: Columbia University Press). {{ISBN|0231034644}}, 111 and 115&lt;/ref&gt;  A good example of a poet known for his ''gushi'' poems is [[Li Bai]] (701–762 CE). Among its other rules, the jintishi rules regulate the tonal variations within a poem, including the use of set patterns of the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]] of [[Middle Chinese]]. The basic form of jintishi (lushi) has eight lines in four couplets, with parallelism between the lines in the second and third couplets. The couplets with parallel lines contain contrasting content but an identical grammatical relationship between words. Jintishi often have a rich poetic diction, full of [[allusion]], and can have a wide range of subject, including history and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faurot|first=Jeannette L|title=Drinking with the moon|year=1998|publisher=China Books &amp; Periodicals|isbn=978-0835126397|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yugen|title=Shige: The Popular Poetics of Regulated Verse|journal=T'ang Studies|date=1 June 2004|volume=2004|issue=22|pages=81–125|doi=10.1179/073750304788913221}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the masters of the form was [[Du Fu]] (712–770 CE), who wrote during the Tang Dynasty (8th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schirokauer|first=Conrad|title=A brief history of Chinese and Japanese civilizations|year=1989|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|isbn=978-0155055698|edition=2nd|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Villanelle ===
[[File:AudenLibraryOfCongress.jpg|thumb|upright|[[W.H. Auden]]]]
{{Main article|Villanelle}}

The villanelle is a nineteen-line poem made up of five triplets with a closing quatrain; the poem is characterized by having two refrains, initially used in the first and third lines of the first stanza, and then alternately used at the close of each subsequent stanza until the final quatrain, which is concluded by the two refrains. The remaining lines of the poem have an a-b alternating rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=314|author=Kumin, Maxine|title=An Exaltation of Forms: Contemporary Poets Celebrate the Diversity of Their Art|chapter=Gymnastics: The Villanelle|editor=Varnes, Kathrine|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0472067251}}&lt;/ref&gt; The villanelle has been used regularly in the English language since the late 19th century by such poets as [[Dylan Thomas]],&lt;ref&gt;"[[Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night]]" in {{cite book|author=Thomas, Dylan|title=In Country Sleep and Other Poems|publisher=New Directions Publications|year=1952|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W.H.

=== Limerick ===
{{main article|Limerick (poetry)}}
A limerick is a poem that consists of five lines and is often humorous. Rhythm is very important in limericks for the first, second and fifth lines must have seven to ten syllables. However, the third and fourth lines only need five to seven. All of the lines must rhyme and have the same rhythm.

=== Tanka ===
[[File:Kakinomoto Hitomaro.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.45|[[Kakinomoto no Hitomaro]]]]
{{Main article|Tanka}}
Tanka is a form of unrhymed [[Japanese poetry]], with five sections totalling 31 ''[[onji]]'' (phonological units identical to [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]]), structured in a 5-7-5-7-7 pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=181|title=Global linguistic flows|editors=Samy Alim, H; Ibrahim, Awad; Pennycook, Alastair|isbn=978-0805862836|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is generally a shift in tone and subject matter between the upper 5-7-5 phrase and the lower 7-7 phrase. Tanka were written as early as the [[Asuka period]] by such poets as [[Kakinomoto no Hitomaro]] (''fl.'' late 7th century), at a time when Japan was emerging from a period where much of its poetry followed Chinese form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brower|first=Robert H|title=Japanese court poetry|year=1988|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0804715249|pages=86–92|author2=Miner, Earl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanka was originally the shorter form of Japanese formal poetry (which was generally referred to as "[[waka (poetry)|waka]]"), and was used more heavily to explore personal rather than public themes. By the tenth century, tanka had become the dominant form of Japanese poetry, to the point where the originally general term ''waka'' ("Japanese poetry") came to be used exclusively for tanka. Tanka are still widely written today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The tanka anthology: tanka in English from around the world|year=2003|publisher=Red Moon Press|isbn=978-1893959408|pages=xxx–xlviii|editor1=McCllintock, Michael |editor2=Ness, Pamela Miller |editor3=Kacian, Jim }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Haiku ===
{{Main article|Haiku}}
Haiku is a popular form of unrhymed Japanese poetry, which evolved in the 17th century from the ''[[hokku]]'', or opening verse of a [[renku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally written in a single vertical line, the haiku contains three sections totalling 17 ''onji'', structured in a 5-7-5 pattern. Traditionally, haiku contain a [[kireji]], or cutting word, usually placed at the end of one of the poem's three sections, and a [[kigo]], or season-word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Haiku moment: an anthology of contemporary North American haiku|year=1993|publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Co|isbn=978-0804818209|editor=Ross, Bruce|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous exponent of the haiku was [[Matsuo Bashō]] (1644–1694).

=== Khlong ===
{{Main article|Thai poetry}}
The ''khlong'' ({{lang|th|โคลง}}, {{IPA-th|kʰlōːŋ|}}) is among the oldest Thai poetic forms. This is reflected in its requirements on the tone markings of certain syllables, which must be marked with ''mai ek'' ({{lang|th|ไม้เอก}}, {{IPA-th|máj èːk|}}, {{lang|th|◌่}}) or ''mai tho'' ({{lang|th|ไม้โท}}, {{IPA-th|máj tʰōː|}}, {{lang|th|◌้}}). This was likely derived from when the Thai language had three tones (as opposed to today's five, a split which occurred during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] period), two of which corresponded directly to the aforementioned marks. It is usually regarded as an advanced and sophisticated poetic form.&lt;ref name="Hudak khloong"&gt;{{cite web|title=โคลง Khloong|work=Thai Language Audio Resource Center|url=http://thaiarc.tu.ac.th/poetry/khloong/khloonge.html|publisher=Thammasat University|accessdate=6 March 2012}} Reproduced form {{cite book|last=Hudak|first=Thomas John|title=The indigenization of Pali meters in Thai poetry|year=1990|series=Monographs in International Studies, Southeast Asia Series|issue=87|publisher=Ohio University Center for International Studies|location=Athens, Ohio|isbn=978-0896801592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''khlong'', a stanza (''bot'', {{lang|th|บท}}, {{IPA-th|bòt|}}) has a number of lines (''bat'', {{lang|th|บาท}}, {{IPA-th|bàːt|}}, from [[Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Pada (foot)|pāda]]''), depending on the type. The ''bat'' are subdivided into two ''wak'' ({{lang|th|วรรค}}, {{IPA-th|wák|}}, from Sanskrit ''varga'').&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In literary studies, ''line'' in western poetry is translated as ''bat''. However, in some forms, the unit is more equivalent to ''wak''. To avoid confusion, this article will refer to ''wak'' and ''bat'' instead of ''line'', which may refer to either.&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''wak'' has five syllables, the second has a variable number, also depending on the type, and may be optional. The type of ''khlong'' is named by the number of ''bat'' in a stanza; it may also be divided into two main types: ''khlong suphap'' ({{lang|th|โคลงสุภาพ}}, {{IPA-th|kʰlōːŋ sù.pʰâːp|}}) and ''khlong dan'' ({{lang|th|โคลงดั้น}}, {{IPA-th|kʰlōːŋ dân|}}). The two differ in the number of syllables in the second ''wak'' of the final ''bat'' and inter-stanza rhyming rules.&lt;ref name="Hudak khloong" /&gt;

==== Khlong si suphap ====
The ''khlong si suphap'' ({{lang|th|โคลงสี่สุภาพ}}, {{IPA-th|kʰlōːŋ sìː sù.pʰâːp|}}) is the most common form still currently employed. It has four ''bat'' per stanza (''si'' translates as ''four''). The first ''wak'' of each ''bat'' has five syllables. The second ''wak'' has two or four syllables in the first and third ''bat'', two syllables in the second, and four syllables in the fourth. ''Mai ek'' is required for seven syllables and ''Mai tho'' is required for four, as shown below. "[[Dead word (Thai language)|Dead word]]" syllables are allowed in place of syllables which require ''mai ek'', and changing the spelling of words to satisfy the criteria is usually acceptable.

=== Ode ===
[[File:Quintus Horatius Flaccus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Horace]]]]
{{Main article|Ode}}

Odes were first developed by poets writing in ancient Greek, such as [[Pindar]], and Latin, such as [[Horace]]. Forms of odes appear in many of the cultures that were influenced by the Greeks and Latins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Thomas|title=English lyrics from Dryden to Burns|year=2000|publisher=Elibron|isbn=978-1402100642|pages=155–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ode generally has three parts: a [[strophe]], an [[antistrophe]], and an [[epode]]. The antistrophes of the ode possess similar metrical structures and, depending on the tradition, similar rhyme structures. In contrast, the epode is written with a different scheme and structure. Odes have a formal poetic diction, and generally deal with a serious subject. The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues. Odes are often intended to be recited or sung by two choruses (or individuals), with the first reciting the strophe, the second the antistrophe, and both together the epode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gayley|first=Charles Mills|title=English Poetry|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1417900862|edition=Reprint|author2=Young, Clement C|page=lxxxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, differing forms for odes have developed with considerable variations in form and structure, but generally showing the original influence of the Pindaric or Horatian ode. One non-Western form which resembles the ode is the [[qasida]] in [[Persian poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuiper|first=edited by Kathleen|title=Poetry and drama literary terms and concepts|year=2011|publisher=Britannica Educational Pub. in association with Rosen Educational Services|isbn=978-1615305391|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ghazal ===

{{Main article|Ghazal}}

The ghazal (also ghazel, gazel, gazal, or gozol) is a form of poetry common in [[Arabic poetry|Arabic]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], [[Urdu poetry|Urdu]] and [[Bengali poetry]]. In classic form, the ghazal has from five to fifteen rhyming couplets that share a [[refrain]] at the end of the second line. This refrain may be of one or several syllables, and is preceded by a rhyme. Each line has an identical meter. The ghazal often reflects on a theme of unattainable love or divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campo|first=Juan E|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|year=2009|publisher=Infobase|isbn=978-0816054541|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other forms with a long history in many languages, many variations have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in [[Urdu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the American Musicological Society|volume=43|issue=3|date=Autumn 1990|title=Musical Gesture and Extra-Musical Meaning: Words and Music in the Urdu Ghazal|author=Qureshi, Regula Burckhardt|pages=457–97|doi=10.1525/jams.1990.43.3.03a00040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghazals have a classical affinity with [[Sufism]], and a number of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form. The relatively steady meter and the use of the refrain produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sequeira|first=Isaac|title=The Mystique of the Mushaira|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|date=1 June 1981|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1981.4745121.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the masters of the form is [[Rumi]], a 13th-century [[Persia]]n poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Religion &amp; Literature|volume=20|issue=1|date=Spring 1988|title=Mystical Poetry in Islam: The Case of Maulana Jalaladdin Rumi|author=Schimmel, Annemarie|pages=67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the most famous poet in this type of poetry is [[Hafez]], whose poems often include the theme of exposing hypocrisy. His life and poems have been the subject of much analysis, commentary and interpretation, influencing post-fourteenth century Persian writing more than any other author.&lt;ref&gt;Yarshater.

== Genres ==
In addition to specific forms of poems, poetry is often thought of in terms of different [[genre]]s and subgenres. A poetic genre is generally a tradition or classification of poetry based on the subject matter, style, or other broader literary characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chandler, Daniel|title=Introduction to Genre Theory|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/intgenre/intgenre.html|publisher=Aberystwyth University|accessdate=10 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509013303/http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/intgenre/intgenre.html|archivedate=9 May 2015|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators view genres as natural forms of literature. Others view the study of genres as the study of how different works relate and refer to other works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=16, 391–402|title=Beyond the screen: transformations of literary structures, interfaces and genres|editors=Schafer, Jorgen; Gendolla, Peter|isbn=978-3837612585|publisher=Verlag|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narrative poetry ===
[[File:Chaucer_Hoccleve.png|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]]]
{{Main article|Narrative poetry}}

Narrative poetry is a genre of poetry that tells a [[narrative|story]]. Broadly it subsumes [[epic poetry]], but the term "narrative poetry" is often reserved for smaller works, generally with more appeal to [[human interest]]. Narrative poetry may be the oldest type of poetry. Many scholars of [[Homer]] have concluded that his ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' were composed from compilations of shorter narrative poems that related individual episodes. Much narrative poetry—such as Scottish and English [[ballad]]s, and [[Balts|Baltic]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] heroic poems—is [[performance poetry]] with roots in a preliterate [[oral tradition]]. It has been speculated that some features that distinguish poetry from prose, such as meter, [[alliteration]] and [[kenning]]s, once served as [[memory]] aids for [[bard]]s who recited traditional tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=22–45|author=Kirk, GS|title=Homer and the Oral Tradition|isbn=978-0521136716|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|edition=reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable narrative poets have included [[Ovid]], [[Dante]], [[Juan Ruiz]], [[William Langland]], [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[Fernando de Rojas]], [[Luís de Camões]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Robert Burns]], [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Alfred Tennyson]], and [[Anne Carson]].

=== Lyric poetry ===
[[File:Christine de Pisan - cathedra.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christine de Pizan]] ''(left)'']]
{{Main article|Lyric poetry}}

Lyric poetry is a genre that, unlike [[epic poetry|epic]] and dramatic poetry, does not attempt to tell a story but instead is of a more [[person]]al nature. Poems in this genre tend to be shorter, melodic, and contemplative. Rather than depicting [[Character (arts)|characters]] and actions, it portrays the poet's own [[feeling]]s, [[Qualia|states of mind]], and [[perception]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blasing|first=Mutlu Konuk|title=Lyric poetry : the pain and the pleasure of words|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691126821|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable poets in this genre include [[Christine de Pizan]], [[John Donne]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], [[Antonio Machado]], and [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]].

=== Epic poetry ===
[[File:Camões, por Fernão Gomes.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Luís de Camões|Camões]]]]
{{Main article|Epic poetry}}
Epic poetry is a genre of poetry, and a major form of [[narrative]] literature. This genre is often defined as lengthy poems concerning events of a heroic or important nature to the culture of the time. It recounts, in a continuous narrative, the life and works of a [[heroic]] or [[mythological]] person or group of persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hainsworth|first=JB|title=Traditions of heroic and epic poetry|year=1989|publisher=Modern Humanities Research Association|isbn=978-0947623197|pages=171–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of epic poems are [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]], the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', [[Luís de Camões]]' ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'', the ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'', the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', [[Valmiki]]'s ''[[Ramayana]]'', [[Ferdowsi]]'s ''[[Shahnama]]'', [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]] (or Nezami)'s Khamse (Five Books), and the ''[[Epic of King Gesar]]''. While the composition of epic poetry, and of [[long poem]]s generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. [[Derek Walcott]] won a [[Nobel prize]] to a great extent on the basis of his epic, ''[[Omeros]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1992/press.html|accessdate=10 December 2011|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1992: Derek Walcott|publisher=Swedish Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Satirical poetry ===
[[File:Jacob Huysmans - Portrait of John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|John Wilmot]]]]
Poetry can be a powerful vehicle for [[satire]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had a strong tradition of satirical poetry, often written for [[political]] purposes. A notable example is the Roman poet [[Juvenal]]'s [[Satires of Juvenal|satires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dominik|first=William J|title=Roman verse satire: Lucilius to Juvenal|year=1999|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci|isbn=978-0865164420|pages=1–3|author2=Wehrle, T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same is true of the English satirical tradition. [[John Dryden]] (a [[Tory]]), the first [[Poet Laureate]], produced in 1682 ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'', subtitled "A Satire on the True Blue Protestant Poet, T.S." (a reference to [[Thomas Shadwell]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=1056|editor=Black, Joseph|title=Broadview Anthology of British Literature|volume=1|isbn=978-1554810482|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another master of 17th-century English satirical poetry was [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Review of English Studies|volume=24|issue=93|title=Satirical Inversion of Some English Sources in Rochester's Poetry|author=Treglown, Jeremy|pages=42–48|doi=10.1093/res/xxiv.93.42|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satirical poets outside England include [[Poland]]'s [[Ignacy Krasicki]], [[Azerbaijan]]'s [[Mirza Alakbar Sabir|Sabir]] and [[Portugal]]'s [[Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage]].

=== Elegy ===
[[File:Gray0004.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Thomas Gray]]]]
{{Main article|Elegy}}
An elegy is a mournful, melancholy or plaintive poem, especially a [[lament]] for the dead or a [[funeral]] song. The term "elegy," which originally denoted a type of poetic meter ([[elegiac]] meter), commonly describes a poem of [[mourning]]. An elegy may also reflect something that seems to the author to be strange or mysterious. The elegy, as a reflection on a death, on a sorrow more generally, or on something mysterious, may be classified as a form of lyric poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pigman|first=GW|title=Grief and English Renaissance elegy|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521268714|pages=40–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=David|title=Elegy|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1134209064|pages=10–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable practitioners of elegiac poetry have included [[Propertius]], [[Jorge Manrique]], [[Jan Kochanowski]], [[Chidiock Tichborne]], [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Ben Jonson]], [[John Milton]], [[Thomas Gray]], [[Charlotte Turner Smith]], [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Evgeny Baratynsky]], [[Alfred Tennyson]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Antonio Machado]], [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], [[Giannina Braschi]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], and [[Virginia Woolf]].

=== Verse fable ===
[[File:Ignacy Krasicki 111.PNG|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Ignacy Krasicki|Krasicki]]]]
{{Main article|Fable}}
The fable is an ancient [[literary genre]], often (though not invariably) set in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]. It is a succinct story that features [[anthropomorphized]] animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that illustrate a moral lesson (a "[[moral]]"). Verse fables have used a variety of [[meter (poetry)|meter]] and [[rhyme]] patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harpham|first=Geoffrey Galt; Abrams, MH|title=A glossary of literary terms|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495898023|page=9|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable verse fabulists have included [[Aesop]], [[Vishnu Sarma]], [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]], [[Marie de France]], [[Robert Henryson]], [[Biernat of Lublin]], [[Jean de La Fontaine]], [[Ignacy Krasicki]], [[Félix María de Samaniego]], [[Tomás de Iriarte]], [[Ivan Krylov]] and [[Ambrose Bierce]].

=== Dramatic poetry ===
[[File:Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (Josef Stieler).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Goethe]]]]
{{Main article|Verse drama and dramatic verse|Theatre of ancient Greece|Sanskrit drama|Chinese Opera|Noh}}
Dramatic poetry is [[drama]] written in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] to be spoken or sung, and appears in varying, sometimes related forms in many cultures. [[Greek tragedy]] in verse dates to the 6th century B.C., and may have been an influence on the development of Sanskrit drama,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith, Arthur Berriedale Keith|title=Sanskrit Drama in its origin, development, theory and practice|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1992|pages=57–58|isbn=978-8120809772}}&lt;/ref&gt; just as Indian drama in turn appears to have influenced the development of the ''[[bianwen]]'' verse dramas in China, forerunners of [[Chinese Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dolby, William|title=Chinese Theater: From Its Origins to the Present Day|chapter=Early Chinese Plays and Theatre|editor=Mackerras, Colin|isbn=978-0824812201|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1983|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[East Asia]]n verse dramas also include Japanese [[Noh]]. Examples of dramatic poetry in [[Persian literature]] include [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]'s two famous dramatic works, ''[[Layla and Majnun]]'' and ''[[Khosrow and Shirin]]'', [[Ferdowsi]]'s tragedies such as ''[[Sohrab|Rostam and Sohrab]]'', [[Rumi]]'s ''[[Masnavi]]'', [[Asad Gorgani|Gorgani]]'s tragedy of ''[[Vis and Ramin]]'', and [[Vahshi Bafqi|Vahshi]]'s tragedy of ''[[Farhad]]''.

=== Speculative poetry ===
[[File:Edgar Poe 1848.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]]]
{{Main article|Speculative poetry}}
Speculative poetry, also known as fantastic poetry (of which weird or macabre poetry is a major sub-classification), is a poetic genre which deals thematically with subjects which are "beyond reality", whether via [[extrapolation]] as in [[science fiction]] or via weird and horrific themes as in [[horror fiction]]. Such poetry appears regularly in modern science fiction and horror fiction magazines. [[Edgar Allan Poe]] is sometimes seen as the "father of speculative poetry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Dutcher, Roger|title=The alchemy of stars|year=2005|publisher=Science Fiction Poetry Association|isbn=978-0809511624|pages=11–17|author=Allen, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poe's most remarkable achievement in the genre was his anticipation, by three-quarters of a century, of the [[Big Bang theory]] of the [[universe]]'s origin, in his then much-derided 1848 [[essay]] (which, due to its very speculative nature, he termed a "[[prose poem]]"), ''[[Eureka: A Prose Poem]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rombeck |first=Terry |date=January 22, 2005 |authorlink= |title=Poe's little-known science book reprinted |journal=Lawrence Journal-World &amp; News |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/jan/22/poes_littleknown_science/ |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilynne Robinson|Robinson, Marilynne]], "On Edgar Allan Poe", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol.

=== Prose poetry ===
[[File:Étienne Carjat, Portrait of Charles Baudelaire, circa 1862.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]]]]
{{Main article|Prose poetry}}

Prose poetry is a hybrid genre that shows attributes of both prose and poetry. It may be indistinguishable from the [[microfiction|micro-story]] ([[List of acronyms and initialisms: A#AK|a.k.a.]] the "[[short short story]]", "[[flash fiction]]"). While some examples of earlier prose strike modern readers as poetic, prose poetry is commonly regarded as having originated in 19th-century France, where its practitioners included [[Aloysius Bertrand]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monte|first=Steven|title=Invisible fences: prose poetry as a genre in French and American literature|year=2000|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0803232112|pages=4–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1980s especially, prose poetry has gained increasing popularity, with entire journals, such as ''The Prose Poem: An International Journal'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.providence.edu/prosepoem/|title=''The Prose Poem: An International Journal''|accessdate=10 December 2011|publisher=Providence College}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Contemporary Haibun Online'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contemporaryhaibunonline.com|title=''Contemporary Haibun Online''|accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Haibun Today''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haibuntoday.com/pages/about.html|title=''Haibun Today''}}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted to that genre and its hybrids.  Latin American poets of the 20th century who wrote prose poems include [[Octavio Paz]] and [[Giannina Braschi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/octavio-paz|title= Poetry Foundation: Octavio Paz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Language Association Presents Giannina Braschi". Circumference Magazine: Poetry in Translation, Academy of American Poets. January 1, 2013. Considered one of the most revolutionary Latin American poets writing today, Giannina Braschi, author of the epic prose poem 'Empire of Dreams'.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light poetry ===
[[File:LewisCarrollSelfPhoto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lewis Carroll]]]]
{{Main article|Light poetry}}

Light poetry, or light verse, is poetry that attempts to be humorous.  Poems considered "light" are usually brief, and can be on a frivolous or serious subject, and often feature [[word play]], including [[pun]]s, adventurous rhyme and heavy [[alliteration]]. Although a few free verse poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition, light verse in English is usually formal.  Common forms include the [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]], the [[clerihew]], and the [[double dactyl]].

While light poetry is sometimes condemned as [[doggerel]], or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way. Many of the most renowned "serious" poets have also excelled at light verse.  Notable writers of light poetry include [[Lewis Carroll]], [[Ogden Nash]], [[X. J. Kennedy]], [[Willard R. Espy]], and [[Wendy Cope]].

=== Slam poetry ===
{{Main article|Poetry slam}}

[[File:FivaMC.jpg|thumb|upright|Poet performing at a [[poetry slam]]]]

Slam poetry is a genre, developed since about 1984, in which performers comment emotively, aloud before an audience, on personal, social, or other matters. It focuses on the aesthetics of word play, intonation, and voice inflection. Slam poetry is often competitive, at dedicated "[[poetry slam]]" contests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.powerpoetry.org/actions/5-tips-spoken-word]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julius Wilhelm Richard Dedekind''' (6 October 1831 – 12 February 1916) was a [[German people|German]] [[mathematician]] who made important contributions to [[abstract algebra]] (particularly [[ring theory]]),
[[Peano axioms|axiomatic foundation for the natural numbers]], [[algebraic number theory]] and the definition of the [[real number]]s.

==Life==
Dedekind's father was Julius Levin Ulrich Dedekind, an administrator of [[TU Braunschweig|Collegium Carolinum]] in [[Braunschweig]]. Dedekind had three older siblings. As an adult, he never used the names Julius Wilhelm. He was born, lived most of his life, and died in Braunschweig (often called "Brunswick" in English).

He first attended the Collegium Carolinum in 1848 before transferring to the [[University of Göttingen]] in  1850. There, Dedekind was taught [[number theory]] by professor [[Moritz Stern]]. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] was still teaching, although mostly at an elementary level, and Dedekind became his last student. Dedekind received his doctorate in 1852, for a thesis titled ''Über die Theorie der Eulerschen Integrale'' ("On the Theory of [[Euler integral|Eulerian integrals]]"). This thesis did not display the talent evident by Dedekind's subsequent publications.

At that time, the [[University of Berlin]], not [[Göttingen]], was the main facility for mathematical research in Germany. Thus Dedekind went to Berlin for two years of study, where he and [[Bernhard Riemann]] were contemporaries; they were both awarded the [[habilitation]] in 1854. Dedekind returned to Göttingen to teach as a ''[[Privatdozent]]'', giving courses on [[probability]] and [[geometry]]. He studied for a while with [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]], and they became good friends. Because of lingering weaknesses in his mathematical knowledge, he studied [[elliptic function|elliptic]] and [[abelian variety|abelian function]]s. Yet he was also the first at Göttingen to lecture concerning [[Galois theory]]. About this time, he became one of the first people to understand the importance of the notion of [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] for [[algebra]] and [[arithmetic]].

In 1858, he began teaching at the [[ETH Zürich|Polytechnic]] school in  [[Zürich]] (now ETH Zürich). When the Collegium Carolinum was upgraded to a ''[[Technische Hochschule]]'' (Institute of Technology) in 1862, Dedekind returned to his native Braunschweig, where he spent the rest of his life, teaching at the Institute. He retired in 1894, but did occasional teaching and continued to publish. He never married, instead living with his sister Julia.

Dedekind was elected to the Academies of Berlin (1880) and Rome, and to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] (1900). He received [[honorary doctorate]]s from the universities of [[University of Oslo|Oslo]], [[University of Zurich|Zurich]], and [[Technical University at Brunswick|Braunschweig]].

==Work==
[[File:ETH-BIB-Dedekind, Julius Wilhelm Richard (1831-1916)-Portrait-Portr 11953.tif (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Dedekind, c. 1886]]
While teaching calculus for the first time at the [[ETH Zürich|Polytechnic]] school, Dedekind developed the notion now known as a [[Dedekind cut]] ([[German language|German]]: ''Schnitt''), now a standard definition of the real numbers. The idea of a cut is that an [[irrational number]] divides the [[rational number]]s into two classes ([[Set (mathematics)|sets]]), with all the numbers of one class (greater) being strictly greater than all the numbers of the other (lesser) class. For example, the [[square root of 2]] defines all the nonnegative numbers whose squares are less than 2 and the negative numbers into the lesser class, and the positive numbers whose squares are greater than 2 into the greater class. Every location on the number line continuum contains either a rational or an irrational number. Thus there are no empty locations, gaps, or discontinuities. Dedekind published his thoughts on irrational numbers and Dedekind cuts in his pamphlet "Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen" ("Continuity and irrational numbers");&lt;ref&gt;Ewald, William B., ed. (1996) "Continuity and irrational numbers", p. 766 in ''From Kant to Hilbert: A Source Book in the Foundations of Mathematics'', 2 vols. Oxford University Press. [http://www.math.ru.nl/werkgroepen/gmfw/bronnen/dedekind2.html full text]&lt;/ref&gt; in modern terminology, ''Vollständigkeit'', ''[[complete space|completeness]]''.

Dedekind's theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=Essays on the Theory of Numbers|publisher=Dover|publication-date=1963|year=1901, Open Court|title=The Nature and Meaning of Numbers|at=Part V, Paragraph 64, October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that if there existed a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between two sets, then the two sets were "similar". He invoked similarity to give the first precise definition of an [[Dedekind-infinite set|infinite set]]: a set is infinite when it is "similar to a proper part of itself," in modern terminology, is [[equinumerous]] to one of its [[subset|proper subsets]]. Thus the set '''N''' of [[natural number]]s can be shown to be similar to the subset of '''N''' whose members are the [[square (algebra)|square]]s of every member of '''N''', ('''N'''&lt;span  style="font-size:140%; color:darkgreen;"&gt; → &lt;/span&gt; '''N'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;):

 '''N''' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1&amp;nbsp; 2&amp;nbsp; 3&amp;nbsp; 4&amp;nbsp; 5&amp;nbsp; 6&amp;nbsp; 7&amp;nbsp; 8&amp;nbsp; 9  10 ...
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;span  style="font-size:140%; color:darkgreen;"&gt; ↓ &lt;/span&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
 '''N'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp; 1&amp;nbsp; 4&amp;nbsp; 9  16 25 36 49 64 81 100 ...

Dedekind edited the collected works of [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet|Lejeune Dirichlet]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], and [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]. Dedekind's study of Lejeune Dirichlet's work led him to his later study of [[algebraic number field]]s and [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s. In 1863, he published Lejeune Dirichlet's lectures on [[number theory]] as ''[[Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie]]'' ("Lectures on Number Theory") about which it has been written that:

{{quote|Although the book is assuredly based on Dirichlet's lectures, and although Dedekind himself referred to the book throughout his life as Dirichlet's, the book itself was entirely written by Dedekind, for the most part after Dirichlet's death.|Edwards, 1983}}

The 1879 and 1894 editions of the ''Vorlesungen'' included supplements introducing the notion of an ideal, fundamental to [[ring (algebra)|ring theory]]. (The word "Ring", introduced later by [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], does not appear in Dedekind's work.) Dedekind defined an [[ring ideal|ideal]] as a subset of a set of numbers, composed of [[algebraic integer]]s that satisfy polynomial equations with [[integer]] coefficients. The concept underwent further development in the hands of Hilbert and, especially, of [[Emmy Noether]]. Ideals generalize [[Ernst Eduard Kummer]]'s [[ideal number]]s, devised as part of Kummer's 1843 attempt to prove [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. (Thus Dedekind can be said to have been Kummer's most important disciple.) In an 1882 article, Dedekind and [[Heinrich Martin Weber]] applied ideals to [[Riemann surface]]s, giving an algebraic proof of the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]].

In 1888, he published a short monograph titled ''Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?'' ("What are numbers and what are they good for?" Ewald 1996: 790),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Richard Dedekind | title=Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen? | location=Braunschweig | publisher=Vieweg | year=1888 }} Online available at: [http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuView?pn=1&amp;url=%2Fmpiwg%2Fonline%2Fpermanent%2Feinstein_exhibition%2Fsources%2F8GPV80UY%2Fpageimg&amp;viewMode=images&amp;tocMode=thumbs&amp;tocPN=1&amp;searchPN=1&amp;mode=imagepath&amp;characterNormalization=reg&amp;queryPageSize=10 MPIWG] [http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN23569441X&amp;DMDID=dmdlog55 GDZ] [http://www.digibib.tu-bs.de/?docid=00063941 UBS]&lt;/ref&gt; which included his definition of an [[infinite set]]. He also proposed an [[axiom]]atic foundation for the natural numbers, whose primitive notions were the number [[1 (number)|one]] and the [[successor function]]. The next year, [[Giuseppe Peano]], citing Dedekind, formulated an equivalent but simpler [[Peano axioms|set of axioms]], now the standard ones.

Dedekind made other contributions to [[abstract algebra|algebra]]. For instance, around 1900, he wrote the first papers on [[modular lattice]]s. In 1872, while on holiday in [[Interlaken]], Dedekind met [[Georg Cantor]]. Thus began an enduring relationship of mutual respect, and Dedekind became one of the very first mathematicians to admire Cantor's work concerning infinite sets, proving a valued ally in Cantor's disputes with [[Leopold Kronecker]], who was philosophically opposed to Cantor's [[transfinite numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Mystery of the Aleph: Mathematics, the Kabbalah, and the Search for Infinity|series=Pocket Books nonfiction|first=Amir D.|last=Aczel|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2001|isbn=9780743422994|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQinWBLQG3UC&amp;pg=PA102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pete Wylie.jpg|alt=|thumb|Rock musician [[Pete Wylie]] is credited with coining "rockism" in 1981.&lt;ref name="Gormely2014" /&gt; ]]
{{Wiktionary|rockism}}

'''Rockism''' is the belief in certain values thought to be intrinsic to [[rock music]], making the genre superior to other forms of [[popular music]].&lt;ref name="Morley" /&gt; A "rockist" may also be someone who regards rock music as the normative state of popular music.&lt;ref name="Rosen2006" /&gt; '''Poptimism''' (or '''popism'''&lt;ref name="Gormely2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gormely|first1=Ian|title=Taylor Swift leads poptimism’s rebirth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/03/taylor-swift-poptimism|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the belief that [[pop music]] is as worthy of professional critique and interest as rock music.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt; Detractors of poptimism describe it as a counterpart of rockism that instead privileges the most famous or best-selling pop, [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]], and [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] acts.&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mann2017"/&gt; 

Magazines devoted to the serious discussion of popular music first developed in the 1960s and 1970s, with some formative rock critics suggesting that enduring pop music art was made by singer-songwriters using traditional rock instruments on [[Album era|long-playing albums]], and that pop hits reside on a lower aesthetic plane as a source of "guilty pleasure".&lt;ref name="Rosen2006"/&gt; The term "rockism" was coined in 1981 by English rock musician [[Pete Wylie]]&lt;ref name="Morley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorman2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanley2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=Bob|authorlink=Bob Stanley (music)|title=Yeah!

Norton|isbn=978-0-393-24270-6|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon became a [[pejorative]] used humorously by self-described "anti-rockist" critics in the [[United Kingdom|British]] press.&lt;ref name="Morley"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morley|first1=Paul|authorlink1=Paul Morley|title=Rockism - it's the new rockism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/may/26/popandrock.coldplay|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=May 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally coinciding with the rise of [[New Pop]] in the early 1980s,&lt;ref name="Stanley2014"/&gt; the term was not generally used beyond small music magazines until the mid 2000s, partly due to the increasing number of [[blogger]]s who used it more seriously in analytical debate.&lt;ref name="Morley" /&gt;

In the 2000s, a critical reassessment of pop music was underway, and by the next decade, poptimism supplanted rockism as the prevailing ideology in popular [[music criticism]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1" /&gt; While poptimism was envisioned as the "antidote" to rockist attitudes,&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"/&gt; opponents of its discourse argue that it has resulted in certain [[pop star]]s being shielded from negative reviews as part of an effort to maintain a consensus of uncritical excitement.&lt;ref name="Lob2016"/&gt; Others argue that the two viewpoints have similar flaws.&lt;ref name="mann2017"/&gt;

==Background==
===Early rock criticism===
{{Details|Music journalism|Art rock}}
[[File:Robert Christgau 05 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Robert Christgau]], pictured in 2005, became one of the first professional rock and pop critics. He later criticized ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' for promoting the "boring rock-as-idealism myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=November 1989|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/vr/rolling-119.php|title=Rolling Stone Presents Twenty Years of Rock &amp; Roll|magazine=Video Review|accessdate=April 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Until the late 1960s, "[[pop music|pop]]" was considered to have the same definition as "rock" or "rock and roll".&lt;ref name=Gloag983&gt;{{cite book|first=Kenneth|last=Gloag|title=The Oxford Companion to Music|publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press|year=2001| isbn=0-19-866212-2|p=983}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1960s to the 1970s, music magazines such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Creem]]'' laid the foundation for [[music journalism|popular music criticism]]&lt;ref name="Wolk05"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolk|first1=Douglas|authorlink1=Douglas Wolk|title=Thinking About Rockism|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/features/0518/050504_music_smallmouth.php|website=''[[Seattle Weekly]]''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050604021323/http://www.seattleweekly.com/features/0518/050504_music_smallmouth.php|date=May 4, 2005|archivedate=June 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to make [[popular music]] worthy of study.&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"/&gt; Following the release of [[the Beatles]]' 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', such magazines began drawing a contrast between "pop" and "rock" (with "[[rock and roll]]" now referring to the 1950s style),&lt;ref name="zoppo"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zoppo|first=Donato|title=Prog: Una suite lunga mezzo secolo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oAThBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT121|year=2014|publisher=Arcana|isbn=978-88-6231-639-2|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a division that gave generic significance to both terms.&lt;ref name=Gloag983/&gt;

"Pop" became associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible.&lt;ref name=Warner2003&gt;T.

==Definitions and etymology==

===Rockism===
{{see also|New Pop}}
"Rockism" was coined in 1981 when English rock musician [[Pete Wylie]] announced his Race Against Rockism campaign, an inversion of "[[Rock Against Racism]]".&lt;ref name="Gorman2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gorman|first=Paul|title=In Their Own Write: Adventures in the Music Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1U4UAQAAIAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Sanctuary|isbn=978-1-86074-341-2|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was immediately repurposed as a [[polemic]]al label to identify and critique a cluster of beliefs and assumptions in music criticism.&lt;ref name="Rag"/&gt; Former ''[[NME]]'' writer [[Paul Morley]] recalled: {{quote|... one or two music journalists writing in the one or two music magazines that existed then were very pleased. I was one of them, and was using the term "rockist" the minute after I read Wylie say it. ... If the idea of rockism confused you, and you lazily thought [[Pink Floyd]] were automatically better than [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], and that good music had stopped with [[punk rock|punk]], you were a rockist and you were wrong. ... Anti-rockism was always violently pro-pop, largely because we original campaigning anti-rockists had been given such a tough time at school for liking [[David Bowie|[David] Bowie]] and [[Marc Bolan|[Marc] Bolan]] and not [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer|ELP]] and [[Led Zeppelin|Led Zep]].&lt;ref name="Morley" /&gt;}}

There is no widespread consensus for the definition of "rockism".&lt;ref name="Rag"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Raggett|first1=Ned|title=Rockism|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/pop_playground/rockism.htm|magazine=[[Stylus Magazine]]|date=June 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, to be a "rockist" was defined as demanding a perception of authenticity in pop music despite whatever artifice is needed.&lt;ref name="Wolk05"/&gt; In 2004, music critic [[Kelefa Sanneh]] offered a definition of rockists: "[S]omeone who reduces rock 'n' roll to a caricature, then uses that caricature as a weapon. Rockism means idolizing the authentic old legend (or underground hero) while mocking the latest [[Celebrity|pop star]]; lionizing punk while barely tolerating [[disco]]; loving the live show and hating the music video; extolling the growling performer while hating the [[lip-synch]]er."&lt;ref name=sanneh&gt;{{cite web|first=Kelefa|last=Sanneh|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/31/arts/music/the-rap-against-rockism.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105070445/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/31/arts/music/the-rap-against-rockism.html  |title=The Rap Against Rockism |journal=The New York Times |date=October 31, 2004 |deadurl=no |archivedate=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further accused rockists of projecting a sexist, racist, and homophobic point of view.&lt;ref name="sanneh" /&gt;

''[[Seattle Weekly]]''{{'}}s [[Douglas Wolk]] acknowledged the loose definition of rockism and proposed: "Rockism, let's say, is treating rock as ''normative''. In the rockist view, rock is the ''standard state'' of popular music: the kind to which everything else is compared, explicitly or implicitly."&lt;ref name="Wolk05"/&gt; ''[[Popmatters]]''{{'}} Robert Loss wrote that "traditionalism" describes the policing of the present with the past, making it a better word for "rockism".&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015" /&gt; Design critic and [[indie pop]] musician [[Nick Currie]] (aka Momus) compared rockism to the international art movement [[Stuckism]], which holds that artists who do not paint or sculpt are not true artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Currie|first1=Nick|authorlink1=Momus|title=Design Rockism|url=http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/design-rockism|website=Aiga Design Archives|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405135726/http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/design-rockism|archivedate=April 5, 2007|date=November 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, as a response to confusion over what the term meant, Morley said that the definition had "something to do with" the following five points:
* "a) the difference between [[Bruce Springsteen|Springsteen]] and [[Captain Beefheart|Beefheart]], [[Album Era|albums and singles]], intelligence and stupidity, glitter and denim, and shaky notions of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] and [[artificiality]]" 
* "b) being able to listen to [[Nick Drake]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] with the same levels of intensity"
* "c) how rock groups hold their guitars and what they do with their legs as they hold their guitars"
* "d) ''[[Q magazine]]'', which turned hardcore rockist values into a glossy magazine"
* "e) the fact that [[Franz Ferdinand (Band)|Franz Ferdinand]] are achingly nostalgic for anti-rockism but are themselves intrinsically rockist."&lt;ref name="Morley" /&gt;

=== Poptimism ===
{{quote box|
 |quote=There is a name for this new critical paradigm, 'popism'—or, more evocatively (and goofily), '[[poptimism]]'—and it sets the old assumptions on their ear: Pop (and, especially, [[hip-hop]]) producers are as important as rock auteurs, [[Beyoncé]] is as worthy of serious consideration as [[Bruce Springsteen]], and ascribing shame to pop pleasure is itself a shameful act.

Poptimism (also called popism)&lt;ref name="Morley"/&gt; is a mode of discourse which holds that pop music deserves the same respect as rock music and is as authentic and as worthy of professional critique and interest.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt; It positions itself as an antidote to rockism&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"/&gt; and developed following [[Carl Wilson (critic)|Carl Wilson]]'s book about [[Céline Dion]]'s album ''[[Let's Talk About Love]]'' and Sanneh's 2004 essay against rockism in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Lob2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lobenfield|first1=Clair|title=Poptimism Isn’t the Problem|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/poptimism-isn-t-the-problem-8137206|work=[[Village Voice]]|date=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, Sanneh asks music listeners to "stop pretending that serious rock songs will last forever, as if anything could, and that shiny pop songs are inherently disposable, as if that were necessarily a bad thing. Van Morrison's '[[Into the Music]]' was released the same year as the Sugarhill Gang's '[[Rapper's Delight]]'; which do you hear more often?"&lt;ref name="sanneh" /&gt; Loss cited Sanneh's article as "a sort of ur-text on poptimism", elaborating:

{{quote|style=overflow:inherit;|By its impoverished terms, the rockist represents traditional values of authenticity while the poptimist is progressive, inclusive, and sees through the myths of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]. The rockist is nostalgic—the old fart who says they don’t make any good music anymore—while the poptimist looks forward and values the new. The rockist makes Art out of popular music, insists on serious meaning, and demands artists who sing their own songs and play instruments, preferably guitars; the poptimist lets pop be fun and, if not meaningless, slight. The rockist is a purist, the poptimist a pluralist; the rockist is old, the popist is young; the rockist is anti-commercialist, the poptimist could care less.&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loss|first1=Robert|title=No Apologies: A Critique of the Rockist v. Poptimist Paradigm|url=http://www.popmatters.com/column/196122-no-apologies-a-critique-of-the-rockist-v.-poptimist-paradigm/|website=[[PopMatters]]|date=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After Sanneh published his 2004 article, an argument about rockism developed in various web circles.&lt;ref name="Morley" /&gt; In 2006, music journalist [[Jody Rosen]] noted the growing backlash against rock's traditional critical acclaim and the new poptimism ideology.&lt;ref name="Rosen2006"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2006/05/the_perils_of_poptimism.html |title=The Perils of Poptimism - Does hating rock make you a music critic? |journal=Slate |first=Jody |last=Rosen |date=May 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, ''[[Washington Post]]'' writer Chris Richards wrote that, after a decade of "righteously vanquishing [rockism's] nagging falsehood", poptimism had become "the prevailing ideology for today’s most influential music critics. Few would drop this word in conversation at a house party or a nightclub, but in music-journo circles, the idea of poptimism itself is holy writ."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;

==Criticism of poptimists==
===Overlap with rockism===
[[File:Christopher Austin Paul Morley.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Paul Morley]] (left), a longtime critic of rockism, argued that many of poptimism's traits were indistinguishable from rockism.]]

In 2006, Morley derided the seriousness of contemporary music writers: "Many of the self-proclaimed American anti-rockists—or popists, or poptimists, or pop pricks—actually write with a kind of fussy, self-important rockist sheen. And for all their studious over-analysis, any definition of rockism is the same today as it's always been."&lt;ref name="Morley" /&gt; That same year, Rosen spoke positively of the new movement but forewarned of possible excesses; that a hierarchy of music biased toward pop is no better than one biased toward rock because both genres have respectable qualities that cannot be ignored.&lt;ref name="Rosen2006"/&gt; A week later, ''PopMatters''{{'}} Rob Horning responded to Rosen's writing with a more negative view of poptimism, writing that it is "sad to think the sharpest critics drowning in self-importance while believing they are shedding themselves of it. Basically by rejecting all that was once deemed important by a previous generation and embracing the opposite, you can make the case for your own importance. This is not optimism, it’s reaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horning|first1=Rob|title='Poptimism' The Death of Pop Criticism|url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/2413-poptimism_the_death_of_pop_criticism/|website=[[PopMatters]]|date=May 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Quietus]]'' in 2017, Michael Hann argued that "the poptimists are just as proscriptive as the rockists", and listed the following as a few poptimist "sacred cows, which are beyond challenge":

*"The solo release by the member of a manufactured group is no longer the sad addendum to the imperial years; it is a profound statement of artistic integrity."
*"The surprise release by the big-name act is in itself, a revolutionary act."
*"To not care about [[Taylor Swift]] or [[Beyoncé]] or [[Lady Gaga]] or [[Zayn Malik]] is in itself questionable. It reveals not your taste in music, but your prejudices. In the worst-case scenario, you may be revealing your unconscious racism and sexism. At best, you're trolling."
*"Commercial success, in and of itself, should be taken as at least one of the markers of quality. After all, 50m [[Elvis]] fans can't be wrong."
*"Just as 'authenticity' is worthless as a symbol of a music's worth, so contrivance and cynicism might be elevated and celebrated, as evidence of the maker's awareness of the game they are playing."&lt;ref name="mann2017"/&gt;

According to Loss, rockism and poptimism are ultimately the same thing, and both rockists and poptimists treat music as a social commodity while mystifying the conditions in which music occurs.&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"/&gt; He adds that, as is common in "a culture wherein history isn't valued much", poptimism neglects its historical precedents. As it presents itself as a radical break in the discourse of popular culture, older rock critics and journalists are usually depicted as "a bunch of bricklayers for the foundations of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]", a notion that Loss disputes: "Like film studies, rock criticism of the late '60s and the '70s was an attempt to make popular music worthy of study; it was poptimism before its day. It's somehow become generally accepted that rock criticism before the new millennium was overwhelmingly rockist."&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"/&gt;

===Commercial bias===
After the 2000s, the effects of poptimism attracted a belief that once a pop star reaches a certain level of stardom, many critics will safeguard them from negative reviews.&lt;ref name="Lob2016"/&gt; Richards argued that poptimism cheerleads the already successful while privileging consensus and smothering dissent.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Richards |first=Chris |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/at-the-top-of-the-pop-music-heap-theres-no-criticizing-the-view/2015/04/16/d98d53a8-e1f2-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html |title=Do you want poptimism? Or do you want the truth? |journal=The Washington Post |date=April 16, 2015 |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''{{'}}s Saul Austerlitz called poptimism a product of [[clickbait|click-driven]] internet journalism that aspired to the lowest common denominator while being actively hostile to people who are fans of genres and bands associated with rockism. He further criticized it for allowing pop music fans to avoid expanding their taste and contrasted the types of music lauded by poptimists with the literature and film praised by book and [[film critic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Saul|last=Austerlitz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/magazine/the-pernicious-rise-of-poptimism.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031173914/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/magazine/the-pernicious-rise-of-poptimism.html |title=The Pernicious Rise of Poptimism |journal=The New York Times Magazine |date=April 6, 2014 |archivedate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loss agreed with Austerlitz's text: "When [he] wrote that '(m)usic criticism's former priority—telling consumers what to purchase—has been rendered null and void for most fans. In its stead, I believe, many critics have become cheerleaders for pop stars,' I imagined an editor and a record label exec swooping down on him saying, "Don't tell them that!" We like to believe criticism is devoid of crass commercialism, but Austerlitz gives away that it never was in the first place."&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"/&gt; He also noted a minuscule number of lowly-rated albums in publications such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'', and ''PopMatters'', and that "telling consumers what to purchase is still the point of a lot of music 'criticism'."&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"/&gt;

Hann says that when writers deal with "upmarket" readership, they "need to be able to justify your coverage, and that [means] thinkpieces hailing the cultural significance of the new pop stars. ... And once you've decided these subjects matter, it's hard to turn round and say: 'Actually, you know what? This isn't much cop.'" He recalls his experience as music editor for ''The Guardian'', where he has "been commissioning those pieces, knowing they will be read ... if no one wanted to read about Taylor Swift, you would never see another thinkpiece about her. Instead, we enter an arms race of hyperbole, as we credit her with forcing Apple to change its streaming terms, dismantling the musical patriarchy, creating new paradigms in music and society."&lt;ref name="mann2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hann|first1=Michael|title=Is Poptimism Now As Blinkered As The Rockism It Replaced? |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/22389-rockism-poptimism|website=[[The Quietus]]|date=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Flavorwire]]''{{'}}s Elisabeth Donnely said that literary criticism "needs a poptimist revolution" in order to understand current literary phenomena such as ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' and better connect with the reading audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Elisabeth|last=Donnelly|url=http://flavorwire.com/474759/why-book-criticism-and-literary-culture-needs-a-poptimist-revolution | title=

Writing for ''Salon'' in 2016, Scott Timberg commented on critics giving more respect to celebrity chef [[Guy Fieri]],{{clarify|reason=confusing – "more" than what?|date=October 2018}} saying "Love or hate what is called poptimism, the impulse seems to be coming to food and restaurant criticism". Timberg likened food critics' "'in defense of [Fieri]' movement" to rock critics who "began writing apologias for [[Billy Joel]] and composed learned deconstructions of [[Britney Spears]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Fieri-ssance is here|author=Scott Timberg|date=September 21, 2016|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/09/21/the-fieri-ssance-is-here-sorry-anthony-bourdain-its-no-longer-cool-to-hate-on-guy-fieri/|publisher=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sensei''''' (can be pronounced "Sensai" as well), '''''Sinsang''''', '''''Sonsaeng''''', '''''Seonsaeng''''' or '''''Xiansheng''''' ({{lang|ja|先生}}) is an honorific term shared in [[Chinese honorifics]] and [[Japanese honorifics]] that is translated as "person born before another" or "one who comes before".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Kōjien Japanese Dictionary|title= 先生}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general usage, it is used, with proper form, after a person's name, and means "teacher";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary|title=Sense}}&lt;/ref&gt; the word is also used as a title to refer to or address other professionals or persons of authority, such as [[clergy]], [[accountant]]s, [[lawyer]]s, [[physician]]s, and [[politician]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets of the Samurai|publisher= Ratti &amp; Westbrook|author= Tuttle|date= 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to show respect to someone who has achieved a certain level of mastery in an art form or some other skill, e.g., accomplished [[novelist]]s, [[musician]]s, [[artist]]s and [[martial arts|martial artists]].

==Etymology==
The two characters that make up the term can be directly translated as "born before" and imply one who teaches based on wisdom from age and experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Akiyama, Jun |url=http://www.aikiweb.com/language/goldsbury1.html |website=AikiWeb |title=Aikido Information: Language: Sensei/Shihan as "Teacher" in Japanese |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word prefaced by the adjective 大, pronounced "dai" (or "ō"), which means "great" or "large", is often translated "grand master". This compound term, "dai-sensei", is sometimes used to refer to the top sensei in a particular school or tradition, particularly within the [[iemoto]] system. For a more senior member of a group who has not achieved the level of sensei, the term {{nihongo|[[Senpai and kōhai|senpai]]|[[wiktionary:先輩|先輩]]}} is used – note the common use of 先 "before"; in martial arts, this is particularly used for the most senior non-sensei member.

The Japanese expression of 'sensei' shares the same characters as the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word 先生, pronounced ''xiānshēng'' in [[Standard Chinese]]. Xiansheng was a courtesy title for a man of respected stature. [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciation of this term may have been *{{IPA|senʃaŋ}} or *{{IPA|sienʃaŋ}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In modern Standard Chinese, it is used in the same way as the title "Mr." Prior to the development of the modern [[vernacular]], ''xiansheng'' was used to address teachers of both genders; this has fallen out of usage in Standard Chinese, though it is retained in some southern Chinese [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] such as [[Cantonese]], [[Hokkien]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], where it still has the meaning "teacher" or "doctor". In Japanese, ''sensei'' is still used to address people of both genders. It is likely both the current Southern Chinese and Japanese usages are more reflective of its Middle Chinese [[etymology]].

== Use in Buddhism ==
In [[Sanbo Kyodan]] related [[zen]] schools, ''sensei'' is  used to refer to ordained teachers below the rank of [[rōshi]]. However, other schools of [[Buddhism in Japan]] use the term for any priest regardless of seniority; for example, this title is also used for [[Jōdo Shinshū]] ministers in the [[United States]], whether they are ethnic Japanese or not. In the [[Kwan Um School of Zen]], according to [[Zen master]] [[Seungsahn]], the [[Korean language|Korean]] title ''ji do poep sa nim'' is much like the Japanese title "sensei".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kwanumzen.org/1987/inka-means-strong-center-and-wisdom/ |title=Zen Master Seung Sahn - Inka Means Strong Center and Wisdom |publisher=Kwanumzen.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406213535/http://www.kwanumzen.org/1987/inka-means-strong-center-and-wisdom/ |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nichiren Buddhism]], members of the [[Soka Gakkai International]] refer to the president of the [[sangha]], currently [[Daisaku Ikeda]], as Sensei.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

[[File:Confucius Laozi Buddha.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Confucius]] handing over [[Gautama Buddha]] to [[Laozi]]]]
In [[Chinese philosophy]], the phrase '''''three teachings''''' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:三|三]][[wikt:教|教]]|p=San Jiao}}) refers to [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhism]] when considered as a harmonious aggregate.&lt;ref name=afe&gt;[http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/cosmos/ort/teachings.htm Sanjiao: The Three Teachings.  Columbia University]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest literary references to the "three teachings" idea dates back to the 6th century by prominent Chinese scholars of the time.&lt;ref name=afe/&gt;  The term may also refer to a non-religious philosophy built on that aggregation.

==Three teachings harmonious as one==
The phrase also appears as the ''three teachings harmonious as one'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:三|三]][[wikt:教|教]][[wikt:合|合]][[wikt:一|一]]}}). It can also refer to a [[syncretic]] sect founded during the [[Ming Dynasty]] by Lin Zhaoen. In that sect  [[Sanyi Religion]], Confucian, Buddhist and Taoist beliefs were combined based on their usefulness in self-cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://faculty.franklin.uga.edu/kirkland/sites/faculty.franklin.uga.edu.kirkland/files/linchao.pdf |title=Lin Zhaoen (Lin Chao-en: 1517-1598) |first=Russell |last=Kirkland |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, in common understanding, ''three teachings harmonious as one'' simply reflects the long history, mutual influence, and (at times) complementary teachings of the three belief systems, with little relationship to Lin Zhaoen's sect.

==Confucianism==
Confucianism is a complex school of thought, sometimes also referred to as a religion, revolving around the principles of the Chinese philosopher [[Confucius]]. It was developed in the Spring and Autumn Period during the Zhou Dynasty. Main concepts of this philosophy include Ru (humaneness), righteousness, propriety/etiquette, loyalty, and filial piety, along with a strict adherence to social roles. This is illustrated through the five main relationships Confucius interpreted to be the core of society: ruler-subject, father-son, husband-wife, elder brother-younger brother, and friend-friend. In these bonds, the latter must pay respect to and serve the former, while the former is bound to care for the latter.&lt;ref name=Craig /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Confucianism|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Confucianism.html|publisher=Patheos|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following quotation is from the ''[[Analects]]'', a compilation of Confucius' sayings and teachings, written after his death by his disciples. 
"The superior man has a dignified ease without pride. The mean man has pride without a dignified ease." 
— Confucius, The Analects of Confucius&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Analects Quotes|url=http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/3320969---lunyu|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This quotation exemplifies Confucius' idea of the junzi (Chinese: 君子) or gentleman. Originally this expression referred to "the son of a ruler", but Confucius redefined this concept to mean behavior (in terms of ethics and values such as loyalty and righteousness) instead of mere social status.&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{cite book|last1=Craig|first1=Albert|title=The Heritage of Chinese Civilization|publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taoism==
Taoism, or Daoism, is a philosophy centered on the belief that life is normally happy, but should be lived with balance and virtue.&lt;ref name=Chiu&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chiu|first1=Lisa|title=Daoism in China|url=http://chineseculture.about.com/od/religioninchina/a/Daoism.htm|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its origin can be traced back to the late 4th century B.C and the main thinkers representative of this teaching are [[Laozi]] and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]].&lt;ref name=Craig /&gt; Key components of Daoism are Dao (the Way) and immortality, along with a stress on balance found throughout nature. There is less emphasis on extremes and instead focuses on the interdependence between things. For example, the yin/yang symbol does not exemplify good or evil. It shows that there are two sides to everything -"Within the Yang there exists the Yin and vice versa." &lt;ref name=Chiu /&gt;

The basis of [[Taoist philosophy]] is the idea of "[[wu wei]]", often translated as "not doing". But, in practice, it refers to an in-between state of "not doing" and "being, but not acting". This concept also overlaps with an idea in Confucianism as Confucius similarly believed that a perfect sage could rule without taking action. Two other assumptions in the Taoist system are 1) any extreme action can initiate a counteraction of equal extremity and 2) excessive government can become tyrannical and unjust, even government created with good intentions.&lt;ref name=Chiu /&gt;

The following is a quote from the Dao De Jing, one of the main texts in Daoist teachings. 
"The truth is not always beautiful, nor beautiful words the truth." 
― Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching (Dao De Jing)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tao Te Ching Quotes|url=https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/100074|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
Buddhism is a religion that is based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama. The main principles of this belief system are karma, reincarnation, and impermanence. Buddhists believe that life is full of suffering, but that suffering can be overcome by attaining enlightenment. Nirvana (a state of perfect happiness) can be obtained by breaking away from (material) attachments and purifying the mind. However, different doctrines vary on the practices and paths followed in order to do so.&lt;ref name=Craig /&gt;   
[[Buddhist Meditation|Meditation]] serves as a significant part in practicing Buddhism. This calming and working of the mind helps Buddhists strive to become more peaceful and positive, while developing wisdom through solving everyday problems. The negative mental states that are sought to be overcome are called "delusions", while the positive mental states are called "virtuous minds".&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Buddhism?|url=http://www.aboutbuddhism.org/what-is-buddhism.htm/|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another concept prominent in the Buddhist belief system is the Eight-Fold Path. The [[Noble Eightfold Path|Eight-Fold Path]] is the fourth of the Four Noble Truths, which is said to be the first of all Buddha’s teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allan|first1=John|title=The Eight-Fold Path|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/8foldpath.htm|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stresses areas in life that can be explored and practice, such as right speech and right intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nourie|first1=Dana|title=What is the Eightfold Path?|url=http://secularbuddhism.org/2013/05/03/what-is-the-eightfold-path/|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Though the term "three teachings" is often focused on how well Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism have been able to coexist in harmony throughout Chinese history, evidence has shown that each practice has dominated, or risen to favor, during certain periods of time.&lt;ref name=Globalsecurity&gt;{{cite web|title=San Jiao / San Chiao / Three Teachings|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/religion-san-jiao.htm|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emperors would choose to follow one specific system and the others were discriminated against, or tolerated at most. An example of this would be the [[Song Dynasty]], in which both Buddhism and Taoism became less popular. Neo-Confucianism (which had re-emerged during the previous [[Tang Dynasty]]) was followed as the dominant philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Theobald|first1=Ulrich|title=Chinese History - Song Dynasty 宋 (960-1279) literature, thought and philosophy|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Song/song-literature.html|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A minority also claims that the phrase "three teachings" proposes that these mutually exclusive and fundamentally incomparable teachings are equal. This is a contested point of view as others stress that it is not so. Confucianism focuses on societal rules and moral values, whereas Taoism advocates simplicity and living happily while in tune with nature. On the other hand, Buddhism reiterates the ideas of suffering, impermanence of material items, and reincarnation while stressing the idea of reaching salvation beyond.&lt;ref name=afe /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6228">'''Threshold host density (N&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)''', in the context of [[wildlife disease]] [[ecology]], refers to the [[Population density|concentration of a population]] of a particular organism as it relates to disease.  Specifically, the threshold host density (N&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) of a species refers to the minimum concentration of individuals necessary to sustain a given disease within a [[population]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Begon, M. |author2=Harper, J.L. |author3=Townsend, C.R. |chapter=Glossary: H |chapterurl=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/Townsend/Glossary/GlossaryH.asp |editor1=Striano, T. |editor2=Reid, V. |title=Essentials Of Ecology |publisher=Wiley |year=2009 |isbn=1444305344 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Threshold host density (N&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) only applies to density dependent diseases, where there is an "aggregation of risk" to the host in either high host density or low host density patches.  When low host density causes an increase in incidence of parasitism or disease, this is known as inverse host density dependence, whereas when incidence of parasitism or disease is elevated in high host density conditions, it is known as direct host density dependence.

Host density independent diseases show no correlation between the concentration of a given host population and the incidence of a particular disease.  Some examples of host density independent diseases are [[sexually transmitted diseases]] in both humans and other animals.  This is due to the constant incidence of interaction observed in sexually transmitted diseases—even if there are only 20 individuals left of a given population, survival of the species requires sexual contact, and continued spread of the disease.

Density dependent diseases are significantly less likely to cause extinction of a population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holmes, E., Kareiva, P., Sabo, J. |title=Efficacy of Simple Viability Models in Ecological Risk Assessment: Does Density Dependence Matter? |journal=Ecology |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=328–341 |year=2004 |jstor=3450199 |doi=10.1890/03-0035|citeseerx=10.1.1.452.245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the natural course of disease will bring down the density, and thus the propinquity of individuals in the population.  In other words, less individuals—as caused by disease—means lower infection rates and a population equilibrium.

==Contact between individuals within a population as it relates to density in host density-dependent disease==

[[File:Densitydependentdiseasegraph.png]]
This graph shows the direct relationship between disease spread through contact and population density.  As the population density increases, so do transmission events between individuals.

==Contact between individuals within a population as it relates to density in sexually transmitted infections==

[[File:Sexuallytransmitteddiseasepopulationcontactsgraph.png]]

There is a rapid initial increase in disease transmission as the population increases from zero, and then the plateau of transmission throughout most of the graph.  As sexual contact is required in nearly all sexually reproducing species, transmission is not very host density dependent.  It is only in cases of near-extinction where sexually transmitted diseases show any dependence on host density.  It is for this reason that sexually transmitted diseases are more likely than density dependent diseases to cause extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cabaret, J. |author2=Hugonnet, L. |title=Infection of roe-deer in France by the lung nematode, ''Dictyocaulus eckerti'' Skrjabin, 1931 (Trichostrongyloidea): influence of environmental factors and host density |journal=J.

==Contact between individuals within a population as it relates to density in vector-borne disease==

[[File:Vectortransmitteddiseasepopulationdensitygraph.png]]

This graph shows the relationship between population density and the transmission of vector-borne disease.  Initially, the number of contacts between individuals and vectors increases as population density increases.  Eventually, however, the advantage of host density diminishes as the density becomes too great for the vector to maintain its natural ecological relationship with the host, and transmission decreases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4649">'''Wesley Alba Sturges''' (1893-1962) was a professor of law at the [[Yale Law School]] from 1924 to 1961, and served as dean of the law school from 1945 to 1954. He received his LL.B. from Yale in 1923. He retired from Yale in 1961 to become dean of the [[University of Miami School of Law]]. He was a prominent figure in Yale's [[Legal Realism]] movement. In his article (with Samuel Clark), ''Legal Theory and Real Property Mortgages'', 37 Yale L. J. 691 (1928), he sought to make the Legal Realist point that doctrinal distinctions between "[[lien theory]]" and "[[title theory]]" did not have any actual effect on how courts ruled in litigation about [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] disputes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.yale.edu/cbl/3083.htm  Yale Law School, Nascent Realism].&lt;/ref&gt; His [[casebook]], ''Cases and Materials on the Law of Credit Transactions'', emphasized the contradictions in judicial decision-making and sought to dispel  the view that "what judges said in one case with its setting can be used to [predict] what they will decide in another case" with a different factual setting.&lt;ref&gt;Book Review, 40 Harv. L. Rev. 510, 513 (1926).&lt;/ref&gt;

From 22 Oct 1938, Sturges fulfilled the role of Executive Director of the Distilled Spirits Institute and gave evidence to the US Congress Investigation of Concentration of Economic Power (Parts 6-8 Liquor Industry) between 14 and 17 March 1939. As 'czar' of the nation's distilled liquor industry, Sturges drew up a code of practice to reform commercial practices, maintain an open competitive market, to end the system of secret rebates and other corner-cutting dodges,  and to balance the field between larger and smaller operations.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Catton, [https://archive.org/stream/investigationofconc06unit/investigationofconc06unit_djvu.txt ''Catton's Washington Column''], {{smallcaps|Victoria Advocate}} (Dec 10, 1939). See also {{smallcaps|Fred Rodell, Woe Unto You Lawyers}} (1939).&lt;/ref&gt;

After he stepped down from the deanship, Sturges taught only three courses, annually in rotation, one semester each year—[[arbitration]], real-property credit transactions, and chattel credit transactions. Using an advanced form of the [[Socratic method#Law schools|Socratic method]], he sought in these courses to teach students rhetoric and advocacy rather than substantive law—what he termed "learning to stand up on your hind legs and make noises like a lawyer." He was famous at Yale for his technique of calling upon a student to recite what a case held, asking him whether he agreed or disagreed with the court's ruling, and regardless of how the student replied, slowly forcing him by pointing out difficulties in that position, to adopt the contrary view, whereupon Sturges would by the same technique then argue the student back to conceding the validity of his original position. The point was to teach students both how to make noises like a lawyer and not to get led down the primrose path by an adversary.&lt;ref&gt;Not all of his colleagues agreed with his approach. Professors [[Friedrich Kessler]] and [[Grant Gilmore]] at times referred to Sturges's brand of legal realism as [[legal nihilism]]. See, e.g., Grant Gilmore, ''The Ages of American Law'' 81 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Grant Gilmore]] said of Wesley Sturges:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What did Wesley teach us?...He taught us forever to be on our guard against the slippery generality, the received principle, the authoritative proposition. He taught us to trust no one's judgment except our own--and not to be too sure of that. He taught us how to live by our wits. He taught us, in a word, how to be lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;''For Wesley Sturges: On the Teaching and Study of Law'', 72 Yale L.J. 646, 654 (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor [[Ralph S. Brown]] said of Sturges:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sturges was the most compelling teacher of my time. He was just a master of the Socratic method. You never knew what ball was under that shell.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Collier, [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/ylsohs/8/ ''A Conversation with Ralph S. Brown''] 5 (2014), Yale Law School Oral History Series. Book 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Life==
Halbfass studied Philosophy, [[Indology]] and [[Classical Philology]] at the universities of Vienna and Göttingen, and successfully defended his doctoral thesis on Indian Philosophy at [[Göttingen University]] in 1967. He was a professor in the departments of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies and South Asia Regional Studies at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] from 1982 until his death in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2000-06-03/news/25600684_1_assistant-professor-philosophy-universities Obituary, Dominic Sama, ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', 3 June 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Prof. [[Ludo Rocher]], Prof. [[Ernest Bender]], Prof. [[George Cardona]], and several other Sanskritists, he made the [[University of Pennsylvania]] the center of Sanskrit learning in North America.

==Works==
His works include ''Indien und Europa, Perspektiven ihrer geistigen Begegnung'' (1981),&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, ''Indien und Europa, Perspektiven ihrer geistigen Begegnung'', Schwabe Verlag, Basel and Stuttgart, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; English translation ''India and Europe: An Essay in Understanding'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Halbfass | first =Wilhelm | year =1988 | title =India and Europe : An Essay in Understanding |  publisher =State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a comprehensive survey of the intellectual encounters between India and Europe from antiquity to the present day.

'''Wu Bong''', born '''Jacob Perl''', was a [[Zen master]] in the [[Kwan Um School of Zen]]. Perl was the head teacher of the European Kwan Um School of Zen. The first student of [[Seungsahn]] in the [[United States]], he had previously practiced [[Zen]] in the [[Sōtō]] tradition at the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] under [[Shunryū Suzuki]].&lt;ref&gt;Prebish; 34&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent one year studying the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] at the Tibetan Nyingmapa Meditation Center in [[Berkeley, California]] under [[Tarthang Tulku]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kwanumzen.fr/spip.php?rubrique2 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012073138/http://www.kwanumzen.fr/spip.php?rubrique2 |date=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Poland]], he and Seungsahn established the first Zen center ever to exist in his home country in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zen.pl/kwanum/en/teachers.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319103801/http://www.zen.pl/kwanum/en/teachers.html |date=March 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 Perl was made a ''Ji Do Poep Sa Nim'' in the Kwan Um School—granting him some teaching responsibilities—and in 1993 he received [[dharma transmission]] from Seungsahn, making him an independent Zen master. Perl's wife, Grazyna Perl ([[Bonyo]]), is also a Zen master in the Kwan Um School of Zen. The pair moved to [[Paris]] in 1995 and established the Paris Zen Center.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kwanumeurope.org/group.php?z=12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igougo.com/travelcontent/journal.aspx?JournalID=32411#1194700 |title=Zen and the art of discovering Paris - IgoUgo Paris Journal - Ozzy-Dave |publisher=Igougo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rabbi Ashlag lived in the [[Holy Land]] from 1922 until his death in 1954 (except for two years in England). In addition to his ''Sulam'' commentary on the [[Zohar]], his other primary work, ''Talmud Eser Sefirot'' is regarded as the central textbook for students of [[Kabbalah]]. Ashlag systematically interpreted the wisdom and promoted its wide dissemination. In line with his directives, many contemporary adherents of Ashlag’s teachings strive to spread [[Kabbalah]] to the masses.&lt;ref name = "Haaretz"/&gt;

==Biography==

===Poland===

Ashlag reputedly studied [[Kabbalah]] from the age of seven, hiding pages from the book ''Etz Chaim'' (''The Tree of Life'') of [[Isaac Luria]] (also known as the ''Arizal'') in the [[Talmud]]ic tractate he was meant to be studying.&lt;ref name = "Haaretz" /&gt; At the age of twelve, he studied the Talmud independently. By nineteen, Ashlag’s knowledge of the [[Torah]] was profound enough for the rabbis of Warsaw to confer upon him the title of rabbi. During this period he worked as a judge in the court of the Warsaw rabbis and also gained experience as a teacher for training judges for Jewish courts. Ashlag also studied German while in [[Warsaw]], and read original texts of [[Hegel]], [[Marx]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Schopenhauer]].&lt;ref name = "Haaretz" /&gt;

While still in Poland, he met an unidentified Warsaw merchant, who revealed himself to Ashlag as a Kabbalist. Ashlag studied with this particular teacher every night for three months, he said, “until my arrogance separated us,” and the teacher disappeared. A few months later Ashlag met the teacher again, and after pleading with him, convinced him to reveal an important kabbalistic secret. The next day, the teacher died.&lt;ref name = "Haaretz" /&gt;

===Israel===

In 1921, at the age of 36, Ashlag made the decision to emigrate to the [[Land of Israel]], a journey that took several months.&lt;ref name = "Haaretz" /&gt; He spent the first few years living anonymously, supporting his family through manual labor by day and writing his commentaries at night. Eventually, he was recognized through his work, and was appointed Rabbi of [[Givat Shaul]], [[Jerusalem]] in 1924.&lt;ref name = "Haaretz" /&gt;

Ashlag was friendly with the Kabbalist and [[Chief Rabbi]] of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], Rabbi [[Abraham Kook]], who recognized Ashlag as a great follower of [[Isaac Luria]]. Ashlag had high hopes of meeting great Kabbalists in [[Jerusalem]] including the [[Sephardi]] followers of the great 18th century Yemenite Jewish Kabbalist ''Sar [[Shalom Sharabi]]''. However, he was profoundly disappointed by his encounter with them. Their views about Kabbalah ran contrary to Ashlag’s experience with the teaching as a means of profound personal transformation and spiritual illumination, by becoming a vessel for divine light.&lt;ref name = "Haaretz" /&gt;

In 1926 Ashlag left for London, and it was there that he wrote his commentary on Isaac Luria's book ''Etz Chaim'' (''The Tree of Life''). This work is entitled ''Panim Meirot Umasbirot''. It took him one and a half years to complete this work. It was published in 1927, and in 1928 Ashlag returned to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]].&lt;ref name = "Haaretz" /&gt;

In 1932 Ashlag and his family moved to [[Jaffa]]. During this period, Ashlag also began one of his main works, ''Talmud Eser Sefirot'', a commentary on all the writings of Isaac Luria.&lt;ref name = "Eser"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this undertaking, he developed a comprehensive explanation of the sequence of the creation of all of the upper worlds (''Olamot Elyonim''), starting with the source of emanation (''Ma'atzil'') and finishing with our world (''[[Olam HaZeh]]''). The work is divided into six volumes, containing sixteen parts and over two thousand pages. Some today consider it as the core of the entire teaching of Kabbalah.

In the 1930s Ashlag, now in his fifties, gathered around him a group of disciples, including Rav Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein, his closest student, and studied [[Kabbalah]] every night, often from shortly after midnight until dawn. He also composed many articles and letters at this time that openly promoted the study of Kabbalah on a mass scale.&lt;ref name = "Haaretz" /&gt; Ashlag went to great lengths to publish Kabbalistic material, in mediums suitable for disseminating the knowledge he had acquired across the entire nation. He began an independent Kabbalistic newsletter publication, “HaUma” (“The Nation”), of which only one issue survived.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Its contents present Ashlag's analytical depths of using knowledge he had attained in Kabbalah to illuminate the cause of political and social problems in human egoism; giving reasons why communism was destined to fail, and offering solutions for correcting the property of human egoism through his teaching method of Kabbalah.&lt;ref name = "HaUma"&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Image:Jerusalem-kever-baal-sulam-20-10-06 045.jpg|thumb|130px|right|[[Ohel (grave)|Ohel]] of Yehuda Ashlag on [[Har HaMenuchot]]]]
Ashlag differs fundamentally from all Kabbalists of the past, who studied and taught Kabbalah in a concealed manner, in that he felt a great need to reveal and clarify the teaching of Kabbalah to the masses.&lt;ref name = "Haaretz" /&gt; This was because he saw that the evil inclination in people (human egoism) would rise to an altogether new height in this era of humanity, causing an altogether new era of internal suffering felt as a meaningless and confused existence.&lt;ref name = "Eser" /&gt;{{Verify source|date=July 2007}}

In 1943, Ashlag moved to Tel Aviv, and there began working on his book, ''HaSulam'' (''The Ladder''), a collection of commentaries on ''The Zohar''. During this period, he wrote for eighteen hours a day, and due to a lack of money he was not able to afford a sufficient amount of paper and ink to write more precise explanations. He later said that if it had been within his capabilities, he would have written a full commentary on ''The Zohar'' in two-hundred volumes, but he was unable to begin the work only because of a lack of means.&lt;ref name="speech"&gt;Ashlag, Y. "Speech in Celebration for the Conclusion of the Zohar." Bnei Baruch Kabbalah Education and Research Institute. Trans., C. Ratz, available at [http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/matan_torah/completion_of_zohar.htm]. Published in original Hebrew as Maamar LeSium HaZohar in Kabbalah LaMathil. 2002. Israel: Bnei Baruch, pp. 28—36.&lt;/ref&gt;

He completed this work in 1953, and later added three more volumes. Rav Ashlag's closest student Rav Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein later finished the work by adding this three volumes called Tikkunei HaZohar "Maalot Hasulam". In honor of the completion of the entire work, his students organized a big feast in Meron, where Ashlag gave the speech that is today printed under the title “Maamar LeSiyum HaZohar” (“An Article for the Completion of the Zohar,” also known as “Speech in Celebration for the Conclusion of the Zohar”).&lt;ref name="speech"/&gt; Yehuda Ashlag died on the day of [[Yom Kippur]] in 1954. He was buried on cemetery [[Har HaMenuchot]] located in [[Givat Shaul]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]].

Rabbi Yehudah Tzvi Brandwein a direct descendent of the famous first Admor of Stretin, Rabbi Yehudah Tzvi of Stretin, was a foremost disciple of  Rabbi Yehudah HaLevi Ashlag (Baal HaSulam). His vast knowledge of the Lurianic system of  Kabbalah enabled him to codify and edit the entire writings of the Ari HaKadosh, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria. He continued with a similar style of translation and commentary of Rabbi Yehudah Ashlag known as Maalot HaSulam (Extension of the Ladder) on those works of  Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, which Rabbi Ashlag didn't complete during his lifetime, namely Hashmatot HaZohar (Various other Writings) and Tikkunei HaZohar.

Rabbi Brandwein was one of the first Jewish settlers within the Old City of Jerusalem after the Six Day War.

Rabbi Yehuda Zvi Brandwein ran a religious school in Jerusalem called Yeshiva Kol Yehudah, founded in 1922 by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag. For a while he also served as the chief rabbi for the Histadrut - the Israeli labor union, using his position to bring many secular Israelis back to Judaism.

==Books==

Ashlag wrote and published two major works. The first, ''Talmud Eser Sefirot'' is a complete re-editing and commentary to the works of 16th century Kabbalist Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]]. This is a comprehensive exposition of the system of the upper worlds, ''Partzufim'' and ''Sefirot'', in the scientific language of Kabbalah which was developed by Luria.&lt;ref name = "Eser" /&gt;

As a core Kabbalistic text, it is especially unique in its utmost precision to detail to the structural organization and processes occurring in the upper worlds. It is set out as a comprehensive textbook, complete with commentaries, a section in each chapter dedicated to further reflection upon the commentaries, definitions of terms, tables of questions and answers, an introduction clarifying how to study Kabbalah in the correct manner, and also a summarized preface of the entire text.&lt;ref name = "Eser" /&gt;

His other masterwork was his ''Sulam commentary on The Zohar'', which earned him the name “Baal HaSulam”. This monumental work took him ten years to complete, written between the years 1943 and 1953. It includes a translation of ''The Zohar'' from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as well as an extensive interpretation.

Rabbi Yehudah Tzvi Brandwein was a foremost disciple of  Rabbi Yehudah HaLevi Ashlag (Baal HaSulam). His vast knowledge of the Lurianic system of  Kabbalah enabled him to codify and edit the entire writings of the Ari HaKadosh, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria. He continued with a similar style of translation and commentary of Rabbi Yehudah Ashlag known as Maalot HaSulam (Extension of the Ladder) on those works of  Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, which Rabbi Ashlag didn't complete during his lifetime, namely Hashmatot HaZohar (Various other Writings) and Tikkunei HaZohar.

Another publication is the notebook of Yehuda Ashlag’s son and disciple, [[Baruch Ashlag]]. His notebook, entitled  ''Shamati'' (''I Heard'']), contains over two hundred articles which were copied down from lessons and talks with his father. Baruch Ashlag kept this notebook with him in secret, until he was on his deathbed, in 1991. It was later published in Hebrew and has been translated into many different languages. The articles in ''Shamati'' form a unique kabbalistic work in their emotional depth of capturing the inner processes that a Kabbalist goes through on the path of spiritual attainment.

==Teachings==

Ashlag’s commentary offered a systematic interpretation of the legacy of the [[Isaac Luria]]. This was the first since the 18th century when the [[Baal Shem Tov]], [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] (Ramchal), the [[Vilna Gaon]] and ''[[Sar Shalom Sharabi]]'' (the Rashash) offered their interpretation of the Luria's teaching. Ashlag’s system focused on the transformation of human [[consciousness]] from the "desire to receive" to the "desire to give," i.e., from egocentricity to altruism. This path of transformation is described in Lurianic Kabbalah.

Ashlag stated that the purpose of studying Kabbalah is equal to the purpose of why human beings were created, and that through its study, a person is capable of revealing the entirety of processes and structures that have taken place in the creation of the universe.&lt;ref name = "Matan1"&gt;{{cite book

"Equivalence of form" with this source means having the same attributes or qualities as it, and Ashlag defines the qualities of this source as being altruistic, namely the desire to give, or in Ashlag's words, the "will to bestow" (''Ratzon LeHashpia'').&lt;ref name = "Matan"&gt;{{cite book

Through intensive study of Kabbalah, a person's desire to give to others is developed in relation to this goal. Ashlag believed that the coming of the [[Messiah]] meant that humans would attain this quality which would allow them to give up their selfishness and devote themselves to loving each other for the sake of life's purpose, as stated in the commandment "love thy neighbor as thyself."&lt;ref name = "Matan" /&gt;

Ashlag had strong political opinions, believing in a religious version of [[libertarian communism]], based on principles of Kabbalah. Though his [[anti-capitalist]] and [[anti-imperialist]] ideas show some [[Marxism|Marxist]] influence, he strongly opposed [[communism]] instituted by force and believed in "developing a community based on love between its members and a society founded on economic justice."&lt;ref name = "Haaretz"/&gt; He supported the [[Kibbutz]] movement and preached to establish a network of self-ruled [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] communes, who would eventually “annul the brute-force regime completely, for ‘every man did that which was right in his own eyes.’”, because “there is nothing more humiliating and degrading for a person than being under the brute-force government”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/full/3811 Building the Future Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Or HaGanuz]] community of Northern Israel is based on the principles of Rabbi Yehudah Ashlag, and is led by Rabbi Mordechai Sheinberger, a prominent contemporary teacher of Rabbi Ashlag's kabbalistic system.

'''Zhu Guangqian''' (朱光潛; 19 September 1897 – 6 March 1986) was one of the founder of the study of [[aesthetics]] in 20th-century China.

== History ==
Zhu graduated from the [[Anhui Province Tongcheng Secondary School]]. After earning his BA from Hong Kong University, he went abroad to study aesthetics at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and [[University College, London]], then to [[France]] and the [[University of Strasbourg]] where he earned his doctorate. Later, he returned to China to write ''The Psychology of Art'' (文藝心理學), ''On Poetry'' (詩論), and ''A History of Western Aesthetics'' (西方美學史), ''Letters on Beauty'' (談美書簡). In the 1930s in [[Beijing]], Zhu Guangqian hosted a literary salon that met monthly to recite prose and poetry, east and west. Regulars included [[Wen Yiduo]] (聞一多), [[Chen Mengjia]] (陳夢家), [[Zhu Ziqing]] (朱自清), Zheng Zhenduo (鄭振鐸), Feng Zhi (馮至), [[Shen Congwen]] (沈從文), [[Bing Xin]] (冰心), [[Ling Shuhua]] (淩淑華), [[Bian Zhilin]] (卞之琳), [[Lin Huiyin]] (林徽因) and [[Xiao Qian]] (蕭乾). These were pivotal figures in Republican literature, and it can perhaps be argued that the salon was important to the formation of the so-called Beijing style literature (京派文學) of the period.

'''''Ānanda''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: आनन्द) literally means [[wikt:bliss|bliss]] or happiness. In the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Vedas]], [[Upanishads]] and [[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad gita]], ānanda signifies eternal bliss which accompanies the ending of the [[Saṃsāra|rebirth cycle]]. Those who renounce the fruits of their actions and submit themselves completely to the divine will, arrive at the final termination of the cyclical life process (''[[saṃsāra]]'') to enjoy eternal bliss (''ānanda'') in perfect union with the godhead. The tradition of seeking union with God through passionate commitment is referred to as ''[[bhakti]]'', or devotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=J. Bruce Long | author2=Laurie Louise Patton | entry=LIFE | title=Encyclopedia of Religion | edition=2nd | volume=8 | publisher=Thomson Gale | year=2005 | pages=5447-5448}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Different meanings of happiness in Hindu philosophy ==

=== Swami Vivekananda ===

[[Swami Vivekananda]] has claimed that the reason different meanings of ''ānanda'' and different ways of achieving it are present in Hindu philosophy is that humans differ from each other, and each chooses the most appropriate path to ''ānanda'' for him or herself.&lt;ref&gt;Pathways to Joy: The Master Vivekananda on the Four Yoga Paths to God 2006 , Swami Vivekananda&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sri Aurobindo ===

According to [[Sri Aurobindo]], happiness is the natural state of humanity, as he mentions in his book [[The Life Divine]] he informs about it as delight of existence. However, mankind develops dualities of pain and pleasure. Aurobindo goes on to say that the concepts of pain and suffering are due to habits developed over time by the mind, which treats success, honour and victory as pleasant things and defeat, failure, misfortune as unpleasant things.&lt;ref&gt;The Life divine 2005,and he calls his way of yoga as [[Integral yoga]]  p. 98-108&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advaita vedanta ===

According to the [[Vedanta]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]], ''ananda'' is that state of sublime delight when the [[jiva]] becomes free from all sins, all doubts, all desires, all actions, all pains, all sufferings and also all physical and mental ordinary pleasures. Having become established in [[Brahman]] it becomes [[jivanmukta]] (a being free from the cycle of rebirth).&lt;ref&gt;Vedanta-sara of Sadananda. Translated and commented by Swami Nikhalananda. Published by [[Advaita Ashrama]], Kolkata. Verse VI.217 p.117 http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Vedantasara-Nikhilananda.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Upanishads repeatedly use the word ''Ānanda'' to denote [[Brahman]], the innermost Self, the Blissful One, who unlike the individual Self has no real attachments.

=== Dvaita vedanta ===

Based on a reading of the Bhagavad Gita, Dvaita vedanta interprets ''ananda'' as happiness derived via good thoughts and good deeds that depend on the state and on the control of the mind. Through evenness of temper and mind, the state of supreme bliss is reached in all aspects of one’s life.&lt;ref&gt;Dvaita Vedānta 1975, T. P. Ramachandran&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vishishtadvaita vedanta ===

According to the Vishishtadvaita vedanta school which was proposed by [[Ramanujacharya]], true happiness can be only through divine grace, which can be only achieved by surrender of one's ego to the [[Divine]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=== Sri Ramana Maharshi ===

According to [[Ramana Maharshi]], happiness is within and can be known only through discovering one's true self. He proposes that ''ananda'' can be attained by inner enquiry, using the thought "Who am I?"&lt;ref&gt;Talks With Ramana Maharshi: On Realizing Abiding Peace and Happiness 2000, Ramana Maharshi&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ways of achieving ānanda ==
Within the various schools of Hindu thought, there are different paths and ways of achieving Happiness. The main four paths are [[Bhakti yoga]], [[Jnana yoga]], [[Karma Yoga]] and [[Raja Yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;Pathways to Joy: The Master Vivekananda on the Four Yoga Paths to God 2006 , Swami Vivekananda&lt;/ref&gt;
