'''AnTuTu''' ({{zh|c=安兔兔|p=ĀnTùTu}}) is a Chinese software benchmarking tool commonly used to benchmark phones and devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.antutu.ABenchMark&amp;hl=en|title=AnTuTu Benchmark - Android Apps on Google Play|author=AnTuTu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/antutu-benchmark-measure/|title=What Does AnTuTu Benchmark Actually Measure?|author=Chris Hoffman|work=MakeUseOf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circumvention==
The AnTuTu benchmark is so common that hardware manufacturers have taken to cheating on the benchmark which makes the benchmark unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/10/03/rampant-cheating-by-android-knockoffs-prompts-antutu-to-launch-new-benchmark|title=Rampant cheating by Android knockoffs prompts AnTuTu to launch new benchmark|date=3 October 2013|work=AppleInsider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="antutu.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antutu.com/view.shtml?id=7242|title=To Against Cheating Benchmark  AnTuTu Release AnTuTu X Benchmark|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In response to this cheating AnTuTu has created a new benchmark, called AnTuTu X, which makes it more difficult for manufacturers to cheat.&lt;ref name="antutu.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.emobile.flashlight%26hl%3Den |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224142503/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emobile.flashlight&amp;hl=en |archivedate=2014-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phandroid.com/2013/10/07/antutu-x-benchmark/|title=AnTuTu X Benchmark prevents manufacturer cheating|author=Chris Chavez|date=7 October 2013|work=Phandroid - Android News and Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''AnaBritannica''''' is an [[encyclopedia]] produced by [[Ana Publishing House]] that began publication in [[Turkey]] on November 5, 1986. It was designed to be published in weekly [[fascicle (book)|fascicle]]s of 64 pages for four years and to total 14,400 pages upon publication of the final fascicle. Its organization and editorial structure were designed in cooperation with [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] The fascicles were designed by [[Bülent Erkmen]].

''AnaBritannica'' is based on the ''Encyclopædia Britannica [[Micropædia]]'', with approximately 120,000 entries and 20,000 images. It incorporates approximately 30,000 articles written for the [[Eastern Hemisphere]], which ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' used as a source to correct its own previous entries.

The third fascicle of ''AnaBritannica'' was confiscated, and a legal case brought against the encyclopedia for acting against the unity of the state. The cases ended up in acquittal and resulted in popular support.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In the past, some Turkish newspapers gave this encyclopedia in return for collected coupons.

'''BitPim''' is an [[Open-source software|open source]] program designed for managing content on [[CDMA]] devices.  Most [[mobile phone]]s using a [[Qualcomm]]-manufactured CDMA [[chipset]] are supported.  The program is also [[cross-platform]], operating on the [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]] operating systems.

Although BitPim might be taken for a [[Personal information manager|personal information manager (PIM)]], its name derives from "bitpym", a suggestion generated by a [[Random password generator|pronouncable-password generator]]; the "y" being replaced with an "i" simply to eliminate ambiguity in pronunciation.  Earlier, the program had been named "Entrocul" by  the same method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitpim.org/papers/oneyear/|title=One year of BitPim|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bitpim is comparable to [[Gammu (software)|Gammu]], QPST, Open Sync, and Gnokii applications. 

== Features ==
Functionality varies depending on the model of the phone. Once the drivers are installed on the PC operating system, the following managing functions are generally supported:

* Phone Book
* Calendar
* [[Computer wallpaper|Wallpapers]]
* [[Ringtone]]s
* Filesystem
* Media
* Memo
* Todo
* Call history
* SMS
* T9 editor

Data can be imported and exported between the phone and [[Microsoft Outlook]] or [[Google Calendar]].

== Implementation ==

BitPim is implemented using the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language with various pieces in [[C (programming language)|C]] to access hardware.  The user interface is [[wxPython]] which in turn wraps [[wxWidgets]].  That gives a native look and feel on each platform.

Most of the functionality is obtained by using the diagnostics mode available in [[Qualcomm#Products|Qualcomm Mobile Station Modem (MSM)]] used by virtually every manufacturer of CDMA phones.  The diagnostics mode provides direct access to the embedded filesystem in the phone.  The remainder of the functionality is via protocols  provided by the handset manufacturers, but these usually only cover updating the phonebook.

Because the sizes of fields in the protocols differ between every model (even from the same handset manufacturer) and even between the same model offered at different carriers, BitPim has code and field descriptions for every model.  A big part of each approximately monthly release is adding support for new phone models.

[[File:Hercules killing Cacus at his Cave.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Hercules killing the fire-breathing Cacus, [[engraving]] by [[Sebald Beham]] (1545).]]
In [[Roman mythology]], '''Cacus''' was a fire-breathing [[giant]] and the son of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]. He was killed by [[Hercules]] after terrorizing the [[Aventine Hill]] before the [[founding of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CACUS: Giant of the Land of Latium|url=http://www.theoi.com/Gigante/GiganteKakos.html|publisher=theoi.com|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
Cacus lived in a cave in [[Italy]] on the future site of [[Rome]]. To the horror of nearby inhabitants, Cacus lived on human flesh and would nail the heads of victims to the doors of his cave. He was eventually overcome by Hercules.

According to [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]], Hercules stopped to pasture the [[cattle]] he had stolen from [[Geryon]] near Cacus' lair. As Hercules slept, the monster took a liking to the cattle and slyly stole eight of them - four bulls and four cows - by dragging them by their tails, so as to leave a trail in the wrong direction. When Hercules awoke and made to leave, the remaining herd made plaintive noises towards the cave, and a single cow lowed in reply.

Angered, Hercules stormed towards the cave. A terrified Cacus blocked the entrance with a vast, immoveable boulder, forcing Hercules to tear at the top of the mountain to reach his adversary. Cacus attacked Hercules by spewing fire and smoke, while Hercules responded with tree branches and rocks the size of millstones. Eventually losing patience, Hercules leapt into the cave, aiming for the area where the smoke was heaviest. Hercules grabbed Cacus and strangled the monster, and was praised throughout the land for his act. According to [[Virgil]] in Book VIII of the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Hercules grasped Cacus so tightly that Cacus' eyes popped out and there was no blood left in his throat: "et angit inhaerens elisos oculos et siccum sanguine guttur."

[[Image:Firenze.Hercules01.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Hercules and Cacus]]  by [[Baccio Bandinelli]] (1525-34); ([[Palazzo Vecchio, Florence]]).]]
Another version of the myth states that Cacus made the cattle walk backwards so they left a false trail. Hercules drove his remaining cattle past a cave, where Cacus was hiding the stolen ones, and they began calling out to each other. Alternatively, [[Caca (mythology)|Caca]], Cacus' sister, told Hercules where he was.

In the Roman tradition, Hercules founded an altar after he killed Cacus. In the [[Aeneid]], the Arcadian King [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]] recounts this story to [[Aeneas]] to explain the rites the people perform yearly to Hercules. This was the  [[Ara Maxima]], where later the [[Forum Boarium]], the cattle market of Rome, was held. Hercules had [[Roman temple|temples]] in the area, including the still extant [[Temple of Hercules Victor]].

==In later literature==
* In the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]], Cacus is depicted as a [[centaur]] with a fire-breathing [[dragon]] on his shoulders and [[snake]]s covering his equine back. He guards over the thieves in the Thieves section of [[Hell]]'s Circle of Fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Dante ''Inferno'' 25.17-33&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Miguel De Cervantes]] in his 1605 novel ''[[Don Quixote]]'' describes the inn keeper in the second chapter of part one "The First Sally from his Native Heath" as "No less a thief than Cacus himself, and as full of tricks as a student or a page boy."&lt;ref&gt;Miguel De Cervantes, ''Don Quixote de la Mancha'' New York. Random House 1949 p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In a second mention, [[Miguel De Cervantes]] also mentions Cacus as a prototypical thief in a comparison in the sixth chapter of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' part one, "The Scrutiny of the Curate and the Barber" when the Curate says "Here we have Sir Rindaldo of Montalbán with his friends and companions, bigger thieves than Cacus, all of them..." The comparison is a slight against Rinaldo, as he had written a book ''The Mirror of Chivalry'' which the Curate and the Barber agree caused, in part, Don Quixote's descent into madness.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel De Cervantes, ''Don Quixote de la Mancha'' New York. Random House 1949 p. 53-54&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Letter to a Friend]]'' [[Sir Thomas Browne]] compares the reluctance with which old people go to the grave with the backwards movements of Cacus' oxen.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas Browne ''Sir Thomas Browne's Religio Medici, Letter to a Friend and Christian Morals'' London. Macmillan 1898 p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cacus is described as a deformed outcast from an Italian village, able only to say "Cacus", in [[Steven Saylor]]'s novel ''[[Roma (2007 novel)|Roma]]'', playing a direct role in the events of the main character of the era.
* [[Lavinia]], in [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s 2008 novel ''[[Lavinia (novel)|Lavinia]]'', describes Cacus as a "fire lord, the chief man of a tribal settlement, who kept [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] alight for the people of the neighborhood, with the help of his [[Vestals|daughters]]." Lavinia comments that the Greeks' story of the beast-man "was more exciting than mine."
* Cacus appears as the main antagonist in [[Rick Riordan]]'s short story in ''[[The Demigod Diaries]]'' titled "The Staff of Hermes." There were references to Cacus' fight with Hercules in that story. In the story, Cacus had stolen Hermes' Caduceus. He later attacked Percy Jackson and Annabeth Chase. Annabeth hit Cacus with her metal claw and Percy killed Cacus with Hermes' Caduceus.
* In the second book of Gargantua and Pantagruel, Cacus has been said to be begat by Polyphemus the Cyclops. Plus Cacus is said to be the giant who fathered Etion.

== In modern languages ==
In the Spanish language, the derived form ''caco''&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;[http://dle.rae.es/?id=6ZYXQcv caco] in the [[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a colloquial word for "thief" and a disused word for a very cowardly man.

The '''''Canadian Global Almanac''''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] reference book containing a large collection of facts and statistics.  It grew out of the American ''[[World Almanac and Book of Facts]]'' when in 1986 an all-Canadian version was published, edited by [[John Filion]] and published by Susan Yates.  [[John Robert Columbo]] later became its editor.  While it was being published, a new edition was released each year in November. The almanac has not been published since 2005.

}}The '''''Cat Sìth''''' ({{IPA-gd|kʰaʰt̪ ˈʃiː|lang}}) or '''''Cat [[Aos Sí|Sidhe]]''''' ({{IPA-ga|kat̪ˠ ˈʃiː|lang}}, '''''Cat Sí''''' in new orthography) is a [[fairy]] creature from [[Celtic mythology]], said to resemble a large black cat with a white spot on its chest. Legend has it that the spectral cat haunts the [[Scottish Highlands]]. The legends surrounding this creature are more common in [[Scottish mythology|Scottish folklore]], but a few occur in [[Irish mythology|Irish]]. Some common folklore suggested that the ''Cat Sìth'' was not a fairy, but a [[witch]] that could transform into a cat nine times.&lt;ref name=Scotlore&gt;{{cite web|last=MacGillivray|first=Deborah|title=The Cait Sidhe|url=http://deborahmacgillivray.co.uk/scotlore_caitsidhe.htm|accessdate=14 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821034420/http://deborahmacgillivray.co.uk/scotlore_caitsidhe.htm|archive-date=21 August 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.catster.com/lifestyle/cats-celtic-folklore-scottish-wildcat-cait-sidhe-sith-samhain-halloween&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cat Sìth may have been inspired by the Scottish wildcat itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Element Encyclopedia of Magical Creatures |last=Matthews |first=John |author2=Caitlín Matthews |year=2005 |publisher=HarperElement |isbn=978-1-4351-1086-1 |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the legends of the ''Cat Sìth'' were inspired by [[Kellas cat]]s, which are a distinctive [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] between [[European wildcat|Scottish wildcat]]s and [[domestic cat]]s only found in [[Scotland]] (the Scottish wildcat is a subspecies of the [[European wildcat]], which is absent from elsewhere in the [[British Isles]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mystery Cats of the World |last=Shuker |first=Karl P.N. |year=1989 |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd. |isbn=0-7090-3706-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
The Cat Sìth is all black with the exception of a white spot on its chest.&lt;ref name=Grimassi&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimassi|first=Raven|title=Encyclopedia of Wicca and Witchcraft|year=2000|publisher=Llewellyn|location=St. Paul|isbn=1-56718-257-7|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is described as being as large as a dog and chooses to display itself with its back arched and bristles erect.&lt;ref name=Grimassi/&gt;

==The King of the Cats==
In the British folk tale [[The King of the Cats]], a man comes home to tell his wife and cat, Old Tom, that he saw nine black cats with white spots on their chests carrying a coffin with a crown on it, and one of the cats tells the man to "Tell Tom Tildrum that Tim Toldrum is dead." The cat then exclaims, "What?! Old Tim dead! Then I'm the King o' the Cats!" Old Tom then climbs up the chimney and is never seen again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobs|first=Joseph|title=More English Fairy Tales|year=1894|chapter=The King o' the Cats}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soul-stealing==
The people of the Scottish Highlands did not trust the Cat Sìth. They believed that it could steal a person's soul, before it was claimed by the gods, by passing over a corpse before burial; therefore watches called the ''Feill Fadalach'' (Late Wake) were performed night and day to keep the Cat Sìth away from a corpse before burial.&lt;ref name="Scotlore"/&gt; Methods of "distraction" such as games of leaping and wrestling, catnip, riddles, and music would be employed to keep the Cat Sìth away from the room in which the corpse lay.&lt;ref name="Scotlore"/&gt; In addition, there were no fires where the body lay, as it was legend that the Cat Sìth was attracted to the warmth.&lt;ref name="Scotlore"/&gt;

==Samhain==
On [[Samhain]], it was believed that a Cat Sìth would bless any house that left a saucer of milk out for it to drink, and those houses that did not let out a saucer of milk would be cursed into having all of their cows' milk dry.&lt;ref name="Scotlore"/&gt;

==Taghaim== 
There was also a practice called Taghaim where they believed that the demonic Cat Sith called Big Ears would appear and grant any wish to those who took part in the ceremony. The ceremony required you to over the course of four days and nights that you burn the bodies of cats&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=cat-sith-celtic-mythology |url=https://www.scotclans.com/cat-sith-celtic-mythology/ |website=scotclans |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumoured to be  practiced by Aleister Crowley

==Transformation==
Some people believed that the Cat Sìth was a witch that could transform voluntarily into its cat form and back nine  times.&lt;ref name="Scotlore"/&gt; If one of these witches chose to go back into their cat form for the ninth time, they would remain a cat for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name="Scotlore"/&gt; It is believed by some that this is how the idea of a cat having nine lives originated.&lt;ref name="Scotlore"/&gt;

A '''certified copy''' is a copy (often a [[photocopy]]) of a primary document that has on it an endorsement or certificate that it is a true copy of the primary document. It does not certify that the primary document is genuine, only that it is a true copy of the primary document.

A certified copy is often used in English-speaking common law countries as a convenient way of providing a copy of documents. It is usually inexpensive to obtain. A certified copy may be required for official government or court purposes and for commercial purposes. It avoids the owner of important documents (especially [[identity document]]s) giving up possession of those documents which might mean a risk of their loss or damage.

It has some similarities to a notarized copy, which is a form used in some countries, and particularly in some States in the USA. A notarized copy is signed by a [[notary public]] (not to be confused with a [[civil law notary|notary in a civil law country]]).

The certified copy is signed by a person nominated by the person or agency asking for it. Typically, the person is referred to as an authorised person.  The person who is authorised to sign the certificate will vary between countries. Sometimes a person is authorised by [[legislation]] to do so (for example a [[court clerk]], [[solicitor]], or [[notary public]]), but this is not always so. In some countries, for example the United Kingdom and South Africa, identity documents can also be certified by authorised Post Office staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postoffice.co.uk/document-certification-service United Kingdom Post Office Document Certification Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

A copy of a primary document that is to be used internationally may have to be in the form of a notarized copy rather than a certified copy. A notarized copy may be more expensive to obtain. A copy of a document to be used internationally may also have to comply with special rules - [[Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents]].

If the primary document has to be translated, an additional certificate is usually required. For example, a birth certificate in Russian is to be used in an English-speaking country. Typically, the document must be translated professionally and have the professional's certificate of accuracy attached to the translation together with a copy of the primary document. Then, the primary document, the translation, and the certificate of accuracy are photocopied in the form of a certified copy. In the case of a birth certificate in English to be used in Russia, it is possible that a notarized copy will be required.

==In Australia==
In Australia, certified copies are solely the creation of administrative practice. There is no specific legislation at federal, State or Territory level.

Certified copies have long been used to give a veneer of authenticity to a photocopy of a primary document. In practice, they are very easy to obtain at almost no cost other than the photocopy, and are used in a wide range of situations, especially with identity documents.

In practice, and purely for convenience, a copy may usually be certified by a person who is able to witness a statutory declaration under federal legislation about [[Statutory declaration|Statutory Declarations]]. Categories of people are listed in Schedule 2 of the ''Statutory Declarations Regulations 1993'' (Cth).&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth Government of Australia, ''Statutory Declarations Regulations 1993''. Available at [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw%5Cmanagement.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200400084?OpenDocument]&lt;/ref&gt;
Schedule 2 states that Chiropractors, Dentists, Legal practitioners, Medical practitioners, Nurses, Optometrists, Patent attorneys, Pharmacists, Physiotherapists, Psychologists, Trade mark attorneys and Veterinary surgeons may certify copies. Part 2 of the Schedule lists various other professions and positions, the members or occupants of which may also certify copies (for example, Judges, Police Officers and Members of Parliament).

A typical certificate endorsed on the photocopy, often typed or stamped except for the signature -

CERTIFIED TRUE COPY OF THE ORIGINAL

I certify that this is a true copy of the original document.

Signed:
Dated:
Authority to sign:
Telephone number:

Certified copies can be quite basic in Australia due to the lack of legislation.  More detail is often required by the person or agency requiring it.  Sometimes the person or agency will contact the person certifying the copy to limit the possibility of a fraudulent copy.

In some States and Territories, police stations and libraries have arrangements to enable documents to be certified or witnessed by a [[Justice of the Peace]].  This service is free.

==In Botswana==
Photocopies can be certified free at a Police Station. Certified copies, for example of the "[[Omang]]" state identity card, are widely used, and are often required for job applications, etc.

==In India==
In India, under section 2(j)(ii) of The Right to Information Act, 2005, the Public Information Officer (PIO) is mandatorily 'required to provide the appellant "Certified copies of documents or records."' In such a case, the PIO is only certifying that copies of documents or records are true copies of those held on a 'X' page of a 'X' file of the Public Authority, irrespective of their original source.

==In Sri Lanka==
In Sri Lanka, certified copy or true copy of an original document can be attested by an [[Attorneys in Sri Lanka|attorney]], a [[notary public]] or a [[Justice_of_the_peace#Sri_Lanka|justice of the peace]].

==In the United States==
Except for notaries public in some states, there are no officials in the US who are authorized to make certified copies of any kind of document presented to them. If one is in a state where notaries public are not authorized to make certified copies, one must deal with the entity that issued the original document to obtain a certified copy.

===Copy certification by U.S. notaries===
Some states in the United States permit [[notary public|notaries public]] to certify copies; the laws or officials who regulate notaries should be consulted for details. The U.S. State Department in 2005 compiled a table summarizing the state laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State. (2005). ''Foreign Affairs Handbook Volume 7 &amp;mdash; Consular Affairs.'' Available from [https://fam.state.gov/FAM/07FAM/07FAM0860.html 7 FAM 860 Certification of True Copies of Documents]&lt;/ref&gt; In the table below, notes from the State Department table have been omitted for states that do not authorize notaries to certify copies.

Notaries in many states keep journals of all their notarial acts. The table shows that in some states notaries may make certified copies of their journals but may not make any other kind of certified copies.

===Notarized Copies of Identification in Non-Certifying States===

In cases where a bank, government agency, or foreign consulate requires a "notarized copy of [[photo identification]]," and the state prohibits notaries from making certified copies, many of these agencies will accept a copy with a form of affidavit from the holder of the photo identification himself or herself attesting to its authenticity, which is then notarized. Thus, all the notary is doing is taking and signing an affidavit and not certifying a copy. The example below is acceptable

STATE OF MINNESOTA
COUNTY OF HENNEPIN

I BERYL MATHILDA D'SOUZA, being duly sworn, deposes and says: That the above pictured instrument of valid photo identification is a true, exact, and unaltered copy of the valid original, my U.S. Passport, to which I am the instrument's custodian, named and pictured therein; and that I presented the original of the above pictured instrument to the undersigned notary public as satisfactory evidence of my identity.

==Notarial Wording==

===United States===
Not all certified copies are prepared by notaries. In the case of certified copies by notaries, the certificate itself is subject to highly variable wording.  In the U.S.:
*I, A.B., a notary public, do certify that on DATE, I carefully compared the attached copy of DOCUMENT with the original.  It is a complete and true copy of the original document.
*I certify that this is a true and correct copy of a document in the possession of A.B. (NH)
*On this DD day of MONTH, YYYY I certify that the ______ document is a true, exact, complete and unaltered copy of the original. (Mass)
*On this DD day of MONTH, YYYY, I hereby certify (1) that the foregoing [or attached] document is an accurate and unaltered copy of NAME OF DOC, presented to me by A.B., the document's custodian, and (2) that, to the best of my knowledge, the copied document is neither a public record nor publicly recorded. (Utah)
*I, ''(name &amp; quality of attestor)'', certify that the foregoing is a true and faithful copy of the original (this day exhibited to me), the same having been carefully examined by me and compared with the said original and found to agree therewith word for word and figure for figure. (US Consulate or Embassy)

===Canada===
*I certify that this photocopy is a true and faithful copy of the original, and that it has been carefully examined by me, compared with the said original, and found to agree with it word for word and figure for figure. (NW Territories)
*...certify that the photostatic reproduction annexed hereto is a true copy of the NAME OF DOC dated DATE of CUSTODIAN'S NAME and that I have carefully compared the said photostatic reproduction with the said original document.  (Toronto)

[[File:Chronicon Lethrense.pdf|{{Largethumb}}|''Chronicon Lethrense'']]
'''''Chronicon Lethrense''''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Lejrekrøniken'' [[English language|English]]: ''Chronicle of [[Lejre]]/Leire'') is a small [[Denmark|Danish]] medieval work from the 12th century, written in [[Latin]].

==Themes==
Unlike ''[[Chronicon Roskildense]]'', which deals primarily with information presented as real historical facts after the introduction of [[Christianity]] in [[Denmark]], ''Chronicon Lethrense'' is a recording of folklore about the old pre-Christian Danish kings and the adventure stories that were eventually associated with them. In that sense it is not much different from the first part of [[Svend Aagesen|Sven Aggesøn]]'s ''[[Brevis Historia Regum Dacie]]'' or [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]]'s ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', though considerably smaller and of much lesser quality. It is sometimes referred to as the "Chronicle of the Kings of Lejre."

One of the noted aspects of ''Chronicon Lethrense'' is the writer's [[Anti-German sentiment|deep hatred of all things German]], which at times takes on epic proportions. This German hatred can also be traced, although to a lesser degree, in Sven Aggesøn's ''[[Brevis Historia Regum Dacie]]'', and to a much lesser degree in Saxo's ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.  The second book of Saxo's Gesta Danorum, starting at Halfdan I, through the fourth book, the reign of Dan II, is based on the genealogy of the Chronicon, though substantial additional mythical material has been used to "flesh it out", and the episode of Kings Dog and Snow have been relegated to later books.

The original version of ''Chronicon Lethrense'' is certainly a work of its own. Its stories are interesting and over time copies found its way to other places; there was a copy in the fourteenth-century Latin Annals of the [[Cathedral]] of [[Lund]]. Because of this, ''Chronicon Lethrense'' is often connected to ''[[Annales Lundenses]]'', of which it is now a part, but it is unlikely the chronicle was originally included in this anthology.

==History==
The chronicle is believed to have been composed in the second half of the 12th century, probably around 1170, and preceded the writing of the far more famous and verbose ''Gesta Danorum'' by ''Saxo'', with which it shares many traditions not found in other sources. Either ''Chronicon Lethrense'' or a closely allied tradition appears to have been one of Saxo's many sources. The "Gesta Danorum" (not to be confused with Saxo's work of the same title) is a later text in East Norse (Old Swedish) derived from the Chronicon Lethrense with corrections from other sources by, presumably, its translator (according to Gordon-Taylor, Introduction to Old Norse). The "Gesta" is the text translated by Peter Tunstall below; it is not technically the Chronicon Lethrense, which is in Latin.

==Authorship==
Although the author is unknown, there is some conjecture that he may have been a [[clerk (position)|clerk]] tightly linked to the Church of [[Roskilde]]. This is based on the great interest the author has in Roskilde City, which he describes in vivid detail, chronicling how it got its name and promising immortality to the city through his writing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7184">The '''DLM Forum''' is a European membership community of Public Archives and parties interested in [[archive]]s, [[records management|records]] and [[information management]] throughout the [[European Union]]. Membership is open to all. The Forum is known for its creation of the [[MoReq2|MoReq]] series of records management standards.

== History ==

The DLM Forum was established in 1994 by the [[European Commission]].  It is based on the conclusions of the [[European Council]] of 17 June 1994&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?mode=dbl&amp;lng1=en,fr&amp;lang=&amp;lng2=da,de,el,en,es,fr,it,nl,pt,&amp;val=303583:cs&amp;page=&amp;hwords=null Resolution 94/C 235/03]&lt;/ref&gt; concerning greater cooperation in the field of archives.

== Meaning of the DLM acronym ==

Originally DLM was an acronym for 'Données Lisibles par Machine' ([[machine-readable data]]).&lt;ref&gt;French for 'machine-readable data'&lt;/ref&gt;  At its 2002 conference in [[Barcelona]] ([[Spain]]) a resolution was passed changing this, so DLM now stands for '[[Document Lifecycle Management]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlmforum.typepad.com/History_of_DLM_Forum_and_MoReq.pdf History] of the DLM Forum and MoReq&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==

According to its constitution&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlmforum.typepad.com/Constitution.pdf DLM Forum Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; (paragraph 3c), one of the DLM Forum's goals is: 'to provide technology and knowledge transfer and information services, appropriate practice guidelines, benchmark indicators and information, educational, skills development and research opportunities.'
The constitution also defines (in paragraph 4) other objectives:
'(a) To provide for information services (on-line information portal, list-serv, publications, discussions forum, news, dynamic document archive);
(b) To provide for technology &amp; knowledge transfer (technology watch, standards, legislation and policy monitoring, consultancy, connecting technology providers with users, partnership development);
(c) To provide for education &amp; skills development (conferences, seminars and exhibitions, workshops and training sessions, managed learning environments);
(d) To provide for research (user needs analysis, economic modeling, ontology development, knowledge engineering, classification, information retrieval).'

== Achievements ==

The most visible achievement of the DLM Forum is the creation of a series of European records management standards, collectively known as "MoReq".   The abbreviation 'MoReq' is a contraction of 'Model Requirements for the management of electronic records'.

The first MoReq requirements document, formally titled [[MoReq2|MoReq]] but today widely known (unofficially) as MoReq1, was published in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/archival_policy/moreq/spec_moreq_en.htm MoReq], {{ISBN|92-894-1290-9}}, [http://moreq.niniel.org/quellen#moreq1 download]&lt;/ref&gt; MoReq rapidly gained acceptance across Europe and beyond. It has been translated into at least twelve languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornwell.co.uk/edrm/moreq.asp MoReq project website] with translations and additional documents&lt;/ref&gt; some of which are from outside the European Union. The enhanced successor document [[MoReq2]] was published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/archival_policy/moreq/spec_moreq2_en.htm MoReq2] {{ISBN|978-92-79-09772-0}}, DOI 10.2792/11981, [http://www.moreq2.eu/downloadsa.htm download]&lt;/ref&gt; Both documents have achieved the status of de facto standards, without the backing of any formal standards body.  MoReq2 was enhanced by a test framework, a records management software certification programme, and an [[XML]] schema.  In March 2010, the DLM Forum announced&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlmforum.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=902&amp;Itemid=58&amp;lang=en] DLM Forum Announces Development of MoReq2010 to Advance Archiving and Information Compliance across Europe&lt;/ref&gt; it had signed a contract with Journal IT for a major update to MoReq, to result in a version that will be called MoReq2010.

Other publications&lt;ref&gt;[http://moreq.niniel.org/quellen Overview about publications of the DLM Forum and MoReq]&lt;/ref&gt; of the DLM Forum include 'Guidelines on best practices for using electronic information',&lt;ref&gt;Guidelines on best practices for using electronic information, {{ISBN|92-828-2285-0}}, available in English, German and French&lt;/ref&gt; seven DLM Whitepapers&lt;ref&gt;AIIM/DLM whitepapers on Document Lifecycle Management published in 2002/2003 in English/German, {{ISBN|3-936534-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Proceedings of the DLM-Forum Conferences.&lt;ref&gt;DLM Forum Conference Barcelona 2002, Proceedings. European Commission, INsAR supplement VII, Brussels-Luxembourg, 2002, {{ISBN|92-894-4415-0}}; DLM Forum Conference Toulouse 2008, Actes des colloques / Proceedings, Archives de France, Paris, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership and administration ==

Any person or organisation can apply to join the DLM Forum; membership is subject to payment of an annual fee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlmforum.eu/index.php/members/join DLM Forum membership fees 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 there are 56 members, including national archives, consultancies, academic institutions, records management software vendors and end-user organisations.

Until 2010, the legal entity of the DLM Forum was the DLM Network [[European Economic Interest Grouping|EEIG]].  In early 2010, the DLM Forum formed the DLM Forum Foundation, a limited company registered in England and Wales, to replace the EEIG as its legal entity.

The DLM Forum is governed by its Executive Committee, which consists of 7 to 9 elected members.  The current chair of the DLM Forum Executive Committee is Jan Dalsten Sørensen from the [[Danish National Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlmforum.eu/files/EC_Directors/JanSorensenBio.pdf|title=Jan Dalsten Sørensen|publisher=DLM Forum Foundation|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DLM Forum established in 2008 a MoReq Governance Board for the maintenance and control of the MoReq2 standard and certification process.

The DLM Forum usually holds member meetings twice a year; generally these meetings are held in the country then holding the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]]. It also organises a major conference every three years; these conferences generally attract about 300 to 400 delegates from [[Europe]] and elsewhere.  Recent conferences have been held in [[Barcelona]] ([[Spain]]), 2002, [[Budapest]] ([[Hungary]]), 2005, [[Toulouse]] ([[France]]), 2008, [[Brussels]] ([[Belgium]]), 2011 and [[Lisbon]] ([[Portugal]]), 2014.

Numerous papers such as the constitution, presentations from conferences and member meetings, translations and products are published on the DLM Forum website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlmforum.eu/] DLM Forum website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ENI 03011455 STELLA MARIS (03).JPG|thumb|right|240px|Dutch [[barge]] ''Stella Maris'' displaying ENI number]]
An '''ENI number''' ('''European Number of Identification''' or '''European Vessel Identification Number''') is a registration for ships capable of navigating on inland European waters. It is a unique, eight-digit identifier that is attached to a [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] for its entire lifetime, independent of the vessel's current [[ship naming and launching|name]] or [[flag state|flag]].

ENI was introduced by the Inland Transport Committee of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] in their meeting on 11–13 October 2006 in [[Geneva]]. It is based on the Rhine Vessel certification system previously used for ships navigating the [[Rhine]], and is comparable to the [[IMO ship identification number]].

==Format==
The ENI number consists of eight Arabic numerals. The first three digits identify the competent authority where the number is assigned (see "List of prefixes" below) and the last five digits are a serial number.&lt;ref name="UNECE-2006" /&gt;

Ships which have a vessel number in accordance to the Rhine Inspection Rules receive an ENI beginning with "0" and followed by the seven digit Rhine number. A vessel which has been issued an IMO number may only receive an ENI number if it has appropriate certifications for inland water travel. Its ENI will begin with "9" followed by its seven digit IMO number.&lt;ref name="UNECE-2006" /&gt;

The ENI number is transmitted by Inland-[[Automatic Identification System]] transponders.

==Requirements==
Not all European vessels are required to carry an ENI number. As of April 2007, a vessel must have an ENI if it operates on inland waterways and meets any of the following criteria: is over {{convert|20|m|0}} in length; is greater than {{convert|100|m3|0}} in volume; is a tug or push boat that operates with a qualifying vessel; is a passenger ship; or is a floating installation/equipment. If a vessel is issued an ENI, this number must be displayed on the sides and [[stern]] of the vessel.&lt;ref name="shipspotting" /&gt;

[[File:Text-txt.svg|thumb|An example of a [[text file]] icon, one of the common representations of an electronic document.]]
An '''electronic document''' is any electronic [[media content]] (other than computer programs or system files) that are intended to be used in either an electronic form or as printed output.
Originally, any [[computer data]] were considered as something internal &amp;mdash; the final data output was always on [[paper]]. However, the development of computer networks has made it so that in most cases it is much more convenient to distribute electronic documents than printed ones. And the improvements in [[electronic display]] technologies mean that in most cases it is possible to view documents on screen instead of [[printing]] them (thus saving paper and the space required to store the printed copies).

However, using electronic documents for final presentation instead of paper has created the problem of multiple incompatible [[file format]]s. Even [[plain text]] computer files are not free from this problem &amp;mdash; e.g. under [[MS-DOS]], most programs could not work correctly with [[UNIX]]-style text files (see [[newline]]), and for non-English speakers, the different [[code page]]s always have been a source of trouble.

Even more problems are connected with complex file formats of various [[word processor]]s, [[spreadsheet]]s and [[graphics software]]. To alleviate the problem, many software companies distribute free [[file viewer]]s for their proprietary file formats (one example is [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]'s [[Portable Document Format|Acrobat Reader]]). The other solution is the development of standardized non-[[Proprietary software|proprietary]] file formats (such as [[HTML]] and [[OpenDocument]]), and electronic documents for specialized uses have specialized formats &amp;ndash; the specialized [[electronic article]]s in physics  use [[TeX]] or [[PostScript]].

{{Expand German|Dunkelmännerbriefe|date=October 2010}}
The '''''Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum''''' ([[English language|English]]: Letters of Obscure Men) was a celebrated collection of [[satire|satirical]] [[Latin]] letters which appeared 1515–1519 in [[Hagenau]], [[Germany]]. They support the German [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] scholar [[Johann Reuchlin]] and they mock the doctrines and modes of living of the scholastics and monks, mainly by pretending to be letters from fanatic Christian theologians discussing whether all Jewish books should be burned as un-Christian or not.

== Background ==

The work was based upon the real-life public dispute between German humanist [[Johann Reuchlin]] and certain [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monks, especially the formerly Jewish convert [[Johannes Pfefferkorn]] who had obtained Imperial authority from [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] to burn all known copies of the [[Talmud]] in 1509. The title is a reference to Reuchlin's 1514 book ''Epistolae clarorum virorum'' ([[English language|English]]: Letters of famous/bright men) which provided a collection of letters to Reuchlin on scholarly and intellectual matters from eminent German humanists such as [[Ulrich von Hutten]], [[Johann Crotus]], [[Konrad Mutian]], [[Helius Eobanus Hessus]], and others, to show that his position in the controversy with the monks was approved by the learned. The Latin adjective ''obscurus'' ("dark, hidden, obscure") is the opposite of ''clarus'' ("bright, famous, obvious") used in the title of Reuchlin's book.{{Or|date=August 2010}}

== Structure and presumptive authors ==

Most of the letters found in ''Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum'' are addressed to [[Ortwin|Hardwin von Grätz]] in [[Deventer]] and contain mock accusations against him, such as allegation that he had been intimate with [[Johannes Pfefferkorn]]'s wife (Letter XII) and that Gratius had defecated his pants in public (letter XL). The letters profess to be written by certain ecclesiastics and professors in [[Cologne]] and other towns of [[Germany]]. Grätz had made himself odious to the liberal minds of the time by what they saw as his arrogant pretension, his determined hostility to the spirit of the age, and his lax morality.

The first issue of the work contained 41 letters, but more were added later. The collection was published anonymously, and the authorship has been a fertile subject of controversy, but the main portion of the letters are attributed to the humanists [[Crotus Rubeanus]] a.k.a. Johannes Jäger, who is said to have originated the idea and the title; [[Ulrich von Hutten]], who contributed mainly to the second volume; [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]; and Reuchlin. The work is credited with hastening the [[Protestant Reformation]].

== Bans and papal excommunication ==

The book was banned in many places, and in regard of the rise of [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Protestant Reformation]], [[Pope Leo X]] excommunicated the authors, readers, and disseminators of the ''Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum'' in 1517, by citing the fact that the discussed matter of burning all Jewish books, especially the Talmud, had never been held as a majority view among Christian scholars.{{Clarify|date=May 2009}}

== Legacy ==
The modern term [[obscurantism]] derives from the title of this work. As the theologians in the book intended to burn "un-Christian" works, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers used the term for conservative, especially religious enemies of progressive Enlightenment and its concept of the liberal spread of knowledge.

[[File:Erycius Puteanus by Anthony van Dyck.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Chalk drawing of Erycius Puteanus by [[Anthony van Dyck]]]]
'''Erycius Puteanus'''&lt;ref&gt;A [[Latinization (literature)|latinization]] of Hendrick van den Putte, Errijck de Put or Eric van der Putte.&lt;/ref&gt; (4 November 1574 – 17 September 1646) was a humanist and philologist from the [[Low Countries]].

==Life==
He was born in [[Venlo]] and studied at the schools of [[Dordrecht]] and [[Cologne]] ([[College of the Three Crowns]]), where he took the degree of [[Master of Arts]], 28 February 1595. He then followed, at Leuven, the lectures on ancient history given by [[Justus Lipsius]].

In 1597 he travelled to Italy and met scholars, especially Cardinal [[Federigo Borromeo]], through whom he was appointed professor of Latin at the [[Palazzo delle Scuole Palatine|Palatine School of Milan]] from 1600 to 1606. Then the [[States of Brabant]] offered him the chair left vacant by Lipsius at Leuven.

He taught at the Collegium Trilingue at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]] for forty years. He was loaded with favours by reigning princes: the [[Archduke Albert of Austria (1559–1621)|Archduke Albert]] appointed him his honorary counsellor (1612), and increased his annual pension by 200 [[ducat]]s (1614), adding the reversion of [[Château-César]]. At the same time he filled, after 1603, the post of historiographer to [[Philip III of Spain]], on behalf of the Milanese, with other appointments. His outspoken language provoked political animosities, and he was almost driven into exile by request of King [[James I of England]], who wrongly believed him to be the author of ''[[Corona Regia]]'' (1615), a scandalous satire about James's parentage and behaviour.

He fathered 17 children, and died in [[Leuven]].

==Work==

Puteanus was an encyclopedist; in one period of his literary activity (1603–19), he detached himself from Lipsius by aiming at personal leadership of a school. He then went back to [[chronological]] works. As a philologist some of his dissertations were reproduced in the ''Thesauri'' of [[Grævius]] and [[Gronovius]].

An '''ethnolinguistic group''' (or '''ethno-linguistic group''') is a group that is unified by both a common [[ethnicity]] and [[language]]. Most ethnic groups have their [[First language|own language]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7oAUeUVtc58C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=ethnic+group+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF2971lt_WAhWQh7QKHYnEAQcQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=ethnic%20group%20language&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Language and Ethnic Identity|last=Fishman|first=Joshua A.|last2=García|first2=Ofelia|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195374926|location=|pages=12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x3gAB7A6-bgC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=ethnic+group+own+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjw3tSFl9_WAhXJI1AKHVTVAswQ6AEIWjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=ethnic%20group%20own%20language&amp;f=false|title=Perspectives on Ethnicity|last=Holloman|first=Regina E.|last2=Arutiunov|first2=Serghei A.|date=1978-01-01|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110807707|location=|pages=244|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the term is often used to emphasise when language is a major basis for the ethnic group, especially with regards to its neighbours.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''''Fédération d'action nationale et européenne''''' ('''FANE''') was a small [[French far-right]] organisation founded in April 1966. Openly [[Neo-Nazi]], it was led by [[Mark Fredriksen]], a bank employee who became involved in activism for [[French Algeria]] after serving in the ''paras'' (paratroopers) there. FANE brought together three movements: ''[[Action-Occident]]'', the ''[[Cercle Charlemagne]]'' and the ''[[Comité de soutien à l'Europe réelle]]''.

== Ideology and history ==
FANE activity was limited: the group had at most a hundred activists. It published a review, ''Notre Europe'', related to [[François Duprat]]'s [[Revolutionary Nationalist Groups]] (GNR), and a news sheet, ''L'Immonde'', which exalted "National-Socialist and White" [[Europe]] and proclaimed the "struggle to the death against the [[Judaism|Judeo]]-[[materialism|materialist]] [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]]." Members of FANE included [[Luc Michel]], now leader of the ''[[Parti communautaire national-européen]]'' (National European Community Party), [[Jacques Bastide]], [[Michel Faci]], [[Michel Caignet]] and [[Henri-Robert Petit]], a journalist and former [[collaborationist]] who had directed the newspaper ''[[Le Pilori]]'' under the [[Vichy regime]]. The FANE maintained international contacts with the British group the [[League of Saint George]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Hill|R. Hill]] &amp; A. Bell, ''The Other Face of Terror- Inside Europe’s Neo-Nazi Network'', London: Collins, 1988, pp.186-189&lt;/ref&gt;

The FANE rallied [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s [[National Front (France)|National Front]] in 1974, gathered around [[François Duprat]] and [[Alain Renault]]'s [[Revolutionary Nationalist Groups]] (GNR). It broke with the FN again in 1978, taking with it parts of the [[Front National de la Jeunesse|FNJ]] members (youth organization of the FN).&lt;ref name=Ann&gt;[http://www.france-politique.fr/annuaire-extreme-droite.htm Annuaire de l'extrême droite en France] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this brief spell in the FN, Fredriksen created the ''Faisceaux Nationalistes Européens'' (FNE) in July 1980. This group would eventually merge with the ''[[Mouvement national et social ethniste]]'' in 1987, and then with the [[French and European Nationalist Party]] (PNFE) in January 1994.

The FANE was dissolved in September 1980 by a [[decree]] of the [[Council of Ministers of France|Council of Ministers]] on September 30, 1980, under the third cabinet of [[Raymond Barre]]. Recreated, it was dissolved again on January 23, 1985 by [[Laurent Fabius]]'s government, and a third time on September 16, 1987 by [[Jacques Chirac]]'s government, on charges of "violent demonstrations organized by this movement, which has as one of its expressed objectives the establishment of a new [[Nazi]] regime," the "[[paramilitary]] organisation of this association and its incitations to [[racial discrimination]]."

[[File:Genera Plantarum 1742.jpg|upright|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Title page of the second edition of [[Linnaeus]]'s ''Genera Plantarum'', [[Leiden]], 1742&lt;center&gt;]]
'''''Genera Plantarum''''' is a publication of Swedish naturalist [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778). The first edition was issued in [[Leiden]], 1737. The fifth edition served as a complementary volume to ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1753). Article 13 of the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] states that "''Generic names that appear in Linnaeus' ''Species Plantarum'' ed. 1 (1753) and ed. 2 (1762–63) are associated with the first subsequent description given under those names in Linnaeus' ''Genera Plantarum'' ed. 5 (1754) and ed. 6 (1764)''." This defines the starting point for nomenclature of most groups of plants.&lt;ref name="Stafleu, p. 102"&gt;Stafleu, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of ''Genera Plantarum'' contains brief descriptions of the 935 plant genera that were known to Linnaeus at that time. It is dedicated to [[Herman Boerhaave]], a Leiden physician who introduced Linnaeus to [[George Clifford III|George Clifford]] and the medico-botanical Dutch establishment of the day. ''Genera Plantarum'' employed his [[Linnaean_taxonomy#Classification_for_plants|“sexual system” of classification]], in which plants are grouped according to the number of stamens and pistils in the flower. ''Genera Plantarum'' was revised several times by Linnaeus, the fifth edition being published in August 1754 (eds. 3 and 4 were not edited by Linnaeus) and linked to the first edition of ''Species Plantarum''.&lt;ref name="Stafleu, p. 102"/&gt; Over the 16 years that passed between the publication of the first and fifth editions the number of genera listed had increased from 935 to 1105.

Linnaeus established the system of [[binomial nomenclature]] through the widespread acceptance of his list of plants in the 1753 edition of ''Species Plantarum'', which is now taken as the starting point for all [[botanical nomenclature]]. ''Genera Plantarum'' was an integral part of this first stepping stone towards a universal standardised [[biological nomenclature]].

==History==
From 1735 to 1738 Linnaeus worked in the Netherlands where he was personal physician to [[George Clifford III|George Clifford]] (1685–1760) a wealthy Anglo-Dutch merchant–banker with an impressive garden containing four large glasshouses that were filled with warmth-loving plants from overseas. Linnaeus was enthralled by these collections and prepared a detailed systematic catalogue of the plants in the garden, which he published in 1738 as ''[[Hortus Cliffortianus]]''. This list was published with engravings by [[Georg Dionysius Ehret|Georg Ehret]] (1708–1770) and [[Jan Wandelaer]] (1690–1759). Linnaeus included Ehret's Tabella (an illustration of his "Sexual System" of plant classification) in his ''Genera Plantarum'' but without credit to the artist. This provoked the accusation from Ehret that "When he was a beginner [Linnaeus] appropriated everything for himself which he heard of, to make himself famous".&lt;ref&gt;Stearn in Blunt, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Ehret probably met Linnaeus again when the latter visited London for a month. The time in the Netherlands was a productive one for Linnaeus because in these four years he also published ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735), ''[[Bibliotheca Botanica]]'' (1736), ''[[Fundamenta Botanica]]'' (1736), ''[[Flora Lapponica]]'' (1737) and ''[[Critica Botanica]]'' (1737), this is in addition to his ''Genera Plantarum'' (1737).&lt;ref&gt;Stearn, 1986 p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Linnaeus's main points is that a botanist can and must know all genera, and must memorise their ‘definitions’ (diagnosis). The natural definitions given in the various editions of the ''Genera Plantarum'' are intended to facilitate this.&lt;ref&gt;Stafleu, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Stability of generic taxonomy was one of his first aims, and the way he went about achieving it aroused the criticism of many of his contemporaries. Yet, this generic reform was one of his greatest achievements: his genera and their nomenclature stand at the beginning of the victory of [[Linnaean taxonomy]].&lt;ref name=s&gt;Stafleu, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; He dealt with the theory of generic names in the ''Critica Botanica'' which was a prelude to his main practical work on the subject, the ''Genera Plantarum''.&lt;ref name=s /&gt; The rules for the formation of generic names are contained in the ''Fundamenta'' but are worked out in greater detail in the ''Critica''.&lt;ref&gt;Stafleu, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a reform of generic definitions that appeared in the ''Genera Plantarum''.

==Publication and dedication==
The type-setting of ''Genera Plantarum'' started in 1736&lt;ref&gt;Stafleu, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the publication of the first edition in early 1737; the book was dedicated to Herman Boerhaave, the great Leiden physician to whom Linnaeus owed his introduction into the medico-botanical Dutch establishment of the day. Linnaeus published a revised edition in 1742. The fifth edition appeared in Stockholm, in 1754, and the sixth, the last one edited by Linnaeus himself, in 1764, also in Stockholm. The last edition that was based on Linnaeus's work was the 9th edition, revised by [[Kurt Sprengel]], and issued in [[Göttingen]], 1830-31.

==Botanical background==
[[File:Ehret-Methodus Plantarum Sexualis-original.jpg|upright|thumb|200px|Ehret's illustrations, in ''Systema Naturae'', showing the characters used to determine Linnaeus's 24 classes of plants.]]
In the work Linnaeus divided the plant kingdom into 24 classes, each of which he named according to the number of stamens and their arrangement in the flowers. In Ehret’s engraved plate these classes are represented by the 24 letters of the Latin alphabet. In Ehret’s original drawing for the plate, preserved in the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London, he has written the name of the plant he had chosen as an example of each particular class, but only for the first ten and last four classes. Each of the first ten classes (A–K) is named according to the number of stamens, beginning with Monandria (one stamen), Diandria (two stamens), etc. up to Decandria (ten stamens). The flowers in the eleventh (L) class, Dodecandria, have 12–19 stamens. The following four classes (M–P) are characterized not only by the number of stamens but also by their position; the four classes (Q–T) have stamens united in a bundle or phalanx, the next three classes (V–Y) have stamens and pistils in separate flowers. The whole is completed with Cryptogamia (Z), which are plants without proper flowers. For this class Ehret chose the fig as an example.

==Nomenclatural importance==
By far the most important edition for nomenclature today is the fifth, published in August 1754 (editions 3 and 4 were not edited by Linnaeus); this is the edition which is linked nomenclaturally with the ''Species Plantarum'', the starting point for the naming of most groups of plants.&lt;ref&gt;Stafleu, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The genus descriptions in this edition were original, methodically and tersely drafted according to his own plan, with an asterisk * following the generic name to indicate that he had studied living material, a dagger † to indicate that he had seen only herbarium material, and the absence of these signs to indicate he had seen no material himself and hence depended upon the literature or correspondence. In preparing a description of a genus he would describe the flower and fruit of the main species most familiar to him and then remove the characters that did not occur in other species. As new species were added Linnaeus should have updated his genus descriptions but in practice did not have time to do so. As a result, some species listed in ''Species Plantarum'' do not fit the descriptions in ''Genus Plantarum''.&lt;ref&gt;Stearn 1971, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;
All generic names in ''Genera Plantarum'' ed. 5 are treated as validly published on 1 May 1753.&lt;ref name="Stafleu, p. 102"/&gt;

==Significance==
[[William Stearn]] states: “The clear typographical layout, the elimination of verbs such as est, occupant and abit, and the much greater detail given for all floral parts … immediately catch the attention. Such improvements in technique made Linnaeus's ''Genera Plantarum'' the model for later works on the genera of plants.”&lt;ref&gt;Stearn, 1960 p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frans Stafleu]] regards ''Genera Plantarum'' as Linnaeus’s most important book with respect to the practical introduction of his ideas – even more than ''Systema Naturae''. The notion that the genus is the basic unit of taxonomy remained in force until the advent of evolutionary biology and biosystematics. “''His reform was daring and thorough, based on an exceptional and practical knowledge of plants; although influenced by somewhat outmoded ideas, it had exactly the salutary effect which he wanted it to have: consistency and simplicity. These two were prime needs for taxonomy in 1737''." &lt;ref&gt;Stafleu, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion''' ({{lang-cy|'''Anrhydeddus Gymdeithas y Cymmrodorion'''}}), often called simply the '''Cymmrodorion''', is a [[London]]-based [[Wales|Welsh]] [[learned society]], with membership open to all. It was first established in 1751 as a [[Social club|social]], cultural, [[literary society|literary]] and [[Philanthropy|philanthropic]] institution. It fell into abeyance between 1787 and 1820, and again between 1843 and 1873. In its second and third incarnations its interests have been predominantly cultural and [[antiquarian]]. The present society claims continuity from that founded in 1751, although the three successive societies have in fact been slightly different in character and aims.

The society continues to be based in London, but now draws two-thirds of its membership from Wales.{{sfn|Jones|2001|p=158}}

==History==

===First Society, 1751–87===
The Society was founded by the brothers [[Lewis Morris (1701–1765)|Lewis]] and [[Richard Morris (folklorist)|Richard Morris]], natives of [[Anglesey]]. The name, coined by Lewis Morris, was a form of the {{lang-cy|cyn-frodorion}} ("earliest natives"), in reference to the place of the Welsh as heirs to the ancient [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]].{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=50–51}}

[[Image:Marx Memorial Library 37a Clerkenwell Green.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[St David's School, Middlesex|Welsh Charity School]] on Clerkenwell Green (now the [[Marx Memorial Library]])]]
Several factors combined to prompt the foundation of the new society. One may have been Lewis Morris's disappointment at his failure to be elected a [[Royal Society#Fellows|Fellow of the Royal Society]].{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=45–46}} More important was a desire to support the [[St David's School, Middlesex|Welsh Charity School]], established in 1716 under the auspices of another London Welsh Society, the [[Honourable and Loyal Society of Antient Britons]]. By the 1740s the Antient Britons had become somewhat moribund, and the new Society of Cymmrodorion was intended in part to supplement its efforts.{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=46–48}} It was also to raise funds to relieve impoverished Welsh people in London.{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=84}} The Society's primary object, however, was to be a hub of social activity for the Welsh in London, and (in the absence of a recognised political or cultural "[[Capital of Wales|capital]]" of Wales) a focus of Welsh culture.{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=48–49}} Regular meetings were held on the first Wednesday of each month, when papers were read on a variety of literary and learned topics.{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=73–77}}

Richard Morris served as the Society's first ''Llywydd'' ("President"). On his death in 1779, the Society offered a silver medal for the best elegy on its late President, a competition which can be seen as a forerunner of the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]].{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=83–84}} Sir [[Watkin Lewes]] succeeded Morris as ''Llywydd'', and served until the first Society's demise in 1787. The Society had also a ''Penllywydd'' ("Chief President"). This office was held by [[William Vaughan (MP)|William Vaughan]] of Corsygedol until shortly before his death in 1775, and then by [[Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 4th Baronet]], of [[Wynnstay]].{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=56–57}}

In the second half of the 18th century the Welsh Charity School was run jointly by the Antient Britons and the Cymmrodorion. The officers of the Cymmrodorion used the school building on [[Clerkenwell]] Green as their business address, sometimes held meetings there, and used one of its rooms as a library.{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=49, 72–73, 236}} The library was intended to hold a copy "of every Book that hath ever been printed in the antient ''British'' language", as well as manuscripts. It was, in other words, regarded as a prototype [[National Library of Wales]].{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=166–67, 236}} A regular and important activity in the Society's calendar (though primarily the responsibility of the Antient Britons) was the annual [[Saint David's Day]] dinner, held to raise funds to support the school.{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=72–73}}

The Cymmrodorion helped to fund a case in [[Canon law (Anglican Communion)|ecclesiastical law]] in which the [[churchwarden]]s and parishioners of a Welsh-speaking [[Benefice#Church of England|benefice]] in [[Anglesey]] challenged the appointment to their [[Benefice#Church of England|benefice]] of a [[Monolingualism|monoglot]] English priest who was unable to minister in Welsh.

Richard Morris died in 1779 and the Society fell into abeyance in 1787.{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=87–89}} In a symbolic gesture, its Presidential Chair was handed over to the [[Gwyneddigion Society]] (another London-based Welsh cultural society, founded in 1770).{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=88, 119}} However, the Charity School, which in 1772 had moved to new premises in [[Gray’s Inn Road|Gray's Inn Lane]], continued to flourish.

===Second Society, 1820–43===
The Society's revival in 1820 was linked to attempts in Wales to establish a National Eisteddfod under the auspices of four provincial [[Cambrian Societies]] (for [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Dyfed]], [[Gwynedd]], [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]] and [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]]), and the perceived need for a central organisation to oversee their activities. Its formal title was therefore the '''Cymmrodorion Society or the Metropolitan Cambrian Institution'''.{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=148–50}} Those active in the revival included [[John Jenkins (Ifor Ceri)|John Jenkins]], [[Gwallter Mechain|Walter Davies]], [[William Jenkins Rees|W. J. Rees]] and [[Richard Edmunds (barrister)|Richard Edmunds]]. The Society's Presidents included [[Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 5th Baronet]] (son of the second Chief President of the first society) and the [[Edward Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis|2nd Earl of Powis]]. Others officers included [[John Parry (Bardd Alaw)|John Parry]] (''"Bardd Alaw"'') as Registrar of Music, [[Henry Davies (journalist)|Henry Davies]] as Librarian, and [[Ioan Tegid|John Jones]] (''"Ioan Tegid"'') as "Welsh Correspondent".{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=153–55}} The Society published Welsh texts, awarded medals, and otherwise supported Welsh culture.

Tensions and differences of opinion developed, however, between the Cymmrodorion Society and the four Cambrian Societies, over their financial relationships, over principles of Welsh spelling, and over whether the eisteddfodau should be predominantly literary or musical events.{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=155–59}} The Society seems to have been wound up in 1843.{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=171}}

[[File:Watkin Williams-Wynn Vanity Fair 14 June 1873.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 6th Baronet, first President of the third Society]]

===Third Society, 1873–present===
The Society was revived for a second time in 1873, on the initiative of, among others, [[Hugh Owen (educator)|Hugh Owen]], [[Henry Brinley Richards]], and [[John Griffith (Y Gohebydd)|John Griffith]] (''"Y Gohebydd"''). [[Robert Jones (writer)|Robert Jones]] of [[Rotherhithe]] subsequently also became a leading figure in its activities. Following in what was now a family tradition, [[Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 6th Baronet]] was made the first President. 

The Society was prominent in the successful establishment of an annual [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]], beginning in 1861; and took part in discussions that led to the establishment of [[Aberystwyth University|University College Wales, Aberystwyth]] in 1872, and the [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum]] and [[National Library of Wales]] in 1907.{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=195–99, 214–17}} It published ''{{lang|cy|Y Bywgraffiadur Cymreig}}'' in 1953, and its [[English language]] counterpart, the ''[[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]]'' in 1959, as well as several supplements.

==Activities==
The Society has its own publications, and holds lectures, all of which concern the native culture, [[Welsh language|language]] and literature of the Welsh. It formerly published the journal ''[[Y Cymmrodor]]'' (1823–43, 1877–1951), and a ''Record Series'' (13 volumes in 23 parts, 1892–1936). Its present journal is the ''[[Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]]'', which has been published regularly since 1897; and it also publishes other occasional volumes relating to historical sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://5hm1h4aktue2uejbs1hsqt31.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/honsoccymmrodorian.pdf |publisher=Royal Historical Society |title=Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion |format=pdf |date= |accessdate=21 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The journals are being digitised by the [[National Library of Wales#Welsh Journals Online|Welsh Journals Online]] project at the [[National Library of Wales]]. 

The Society continues to be London-based but it also holds a number of meetings in Wales. A special lecture in Welsh is held each year at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, known as the Sir [[T. H. Parry-Williams]] Memorial Lecture, after the poet, author and academic who died in 1975.

==Ideology==
The first society's motto was "''Undeb a Brawdgarwch''" ("Unity and Fraternity"). Reflecting the changing roles of the later incarnations, the motto of the second and third societies has been "''Cared Doeth yr Encilion''" ("Let the Wise Cherish Antiquity").{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=52, 121, 164–65, 226}}

The Society has always been notably nondenominational and apolitical, which means it has had more in common with its counterparts in [[Scotland]] than with those in [[Ireland]].

==Address==
The Society's postal address is 157–63 [[Gray's Inn Road]], London WC1X 8UE, the premises of the [[London Welsh Centre]].

==Cultural references==
[[Thomas Pennant]]'s ''British Zoology'' was published in 1766 "under the auspices of the Cymmrodorion Society", and was "sold for the benefit of the British Charity-School on Clerkenwell Green". In fact the publication lost money, and so the school derived no direct benefit from it; although Pennant did, independently, give a donation of £100.{{sfn|Jenkins|Ramage|1951|pp=82–83}}

The Society is mentioned by [[Robert Graves]] in his autobiography, ''[[Good-Bye to All That]]'' (1929). He attended a meeting organised by the Cymmrodorion in April 1916, while on leave from the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], to hear [[Billy Hughes|W. M. Hughes]], then [[Prime Minister of Australia]], and [[David Lloyd George]], then [[Secretary of State for War]], speak. Of Lloyd George he wrote: "The power of his rhetoric amazed me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Graves |authorlink=Robert Graves |origyear=1929 |year=1960 |title=[[Good-Bye to All That]] |edition=2nd |place=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Horrors of the Black Museum''''' (1959) is a British-American [[horror film]] starring [[Michael Gough]] and directed by [[Arthur Crabtree]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/36877&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first film in what film critic [[David Pirie]] dubbed [[Anglo-Amalgamated]]'s "Sadian trilogy" (the other two being ''[[Circus of Horrors]]'' and ''[[Peeping Tom (film)|Peeping Tom]]''), with an emphasis on [[Sadomasochism|sadism]], cruelty and violence (with sexual undertones), in contrast to the supernatural horror of the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer films]] of the same era.

==Plot==
A package is delivered to Gail, a young blonde woman with a roommate named Peggy. Gail opens the package to find a pair of binoculars, but when she uses them to look out a window, she screams and collapses, dying. The binoculars are revealed to have two spikes emerging out of the eyepiece.

Peggy is being interviewed by Superintendent Graham and Inspector Lodge when journalist and crime writer Edmond Bancroft enters the room. He wishes to see the binoculars for himself, and Graham remarks on their similarity to binoculars in Scotland Yard's "Black Museum".

Bancroft then purchases a dagger at Aggie's antique shop. Returning to his house, he enters his secret basement museum with his assistant Rick. The museum exhibits various weapons and implements of torture used by criminals.

Bancroft visits his doctor, Dr. Ballan, and tells him that he cannot rest until the killer is apprehended. Ballan observes that Bancroft goes into a state of shock after the murders, noting that he needs psychiatric treatment and should be hospitalized.

Bancroft later visits his mistress Joan in her flat, who argues with him, asking for money and calling him a cripple. Joan leaves her apartment for a bar where she dances provocatively to music from a jukebox. She returns to her flat and prepares to sleep, but when she lays down on her bed she gasps, seeing a guillotine and a man with a hideous face above her bed frame. When the guillotine blade falls she screams, gathering curious neighbors at her door. The hideous man pushes his way through this crowd when he makes his escape. Graham investigates, questioning the crowd of neighbors who mention the man's strange appearance.

At a cocktail party, Graham tells Bancroft that the police have captured Tom Rivers, who has confessed to the murders. Rivers later admits to various other famous crimes, revealing himself to be a fantasist, but Graham keeps Rivers to try to capture the true culprit. Bancroft hears of Rivers' confession and requests to see Rivers, but Graham explains that Rivers has been sent to a mental hospital.

Rick sneaks away from his duties with Bancroft to meet his fiancée, Angela, and he explains that he is being hypnotized and controlled by Bancroft.

When Bancroft returns to the antique shop to purchase ice tongs, Aggie reveals that she knows that Bancroft uses the weapons he buys to murder. She demands £1200 for the tongs to not tell the police. Bancroft uses the tongs to murder her.

Ballan visits Bancroft and explains that he needs psychiatric help. Bancroft knocks out the doctor with a laser from his machine in his basement "Black museum". Rick chains the body then lowers it into a vat of acid. When Rick pulls out the chain only a skeleton is left.

After signing copies of his books at an event, Bancroft returns to his basement museum to find finds Rick with Angela. When Angela leaves, Bancroft injects Rick with a drug to better control his actions. Bancroft explains that Rick will inherit the "Black museum" when Bancroft dies and commands Rick to deal with Angela.

Later, at a carnival, Angela and Rick ride in the Tunnel of Love. Towards the end of the tunnel, a transformed and hideous Rick takes out a knife and stabs Angela, killing her. Fleeing through the hall of mirrors, Rick is chased by police up a Ferris Wheel. Bancroft is with Graham when he hears that the murderer is trapped. They both arrive at the carnival where policemen are asking Rick to climb down. Rick, slurring, addresses Bancroft, who frantically urges the policemen to kill the monster before he reveals Bancroft's secret. Rick jumps from the wheel and plunges his knife into Bancroft's heart.

Looking at the two men on the ground, Superintendent Graham remarks that the case of the "monster killer" has been solved.

==Production==
Producer Herman Cohen said he got the idea for the film after reading a series of newspaper articles about Scotland Yard's [[Black Museum]]. He arranged through a contact to visit the museum, then wrote a treatment and later collaborated with [[Aben Kandel]] on the screenplay. Cohen says the use of binoculars as murder weapons, and all the other instruments of death in the film, were based on real-life murder cases.&lt;ref name="herman"/&gt;

Half the money for the budget was provided by [[Nat Cohen]] and [[Stuart Levy (producer)|Stuart Levy]] of [[Anglo-Amalgamated]] in the UK, the other half from [[American International Pictures]]. It was the first movie from AIP in CinemaScope and colour.&lt;ref name="herman"&gt;[http://www.hermancohen.com/interview-attack4.html "Attack of the Monster Movie Makers: Herman Cohen, The London Years" By Tom Weaver ''Hermancohen.com''] accessed 1 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The credited producer was Jack Greenwood, but Herman Cohen says this came about to ensure the film qualified for the [[Eady levy]], and in fact, Greenwood was more of an associate producer assisting Cohen.&lt;ref name="herman"/&gt;

Cohen wanted to hire [[Vincent Price]] for the lead and also considered [[Orson Welles]], but Anglo-Amalgamated pushed for a British actor in the lead, as it would be cheaper, so they decided to use Michael Gough. [[Arthur Crabtree]] was hired on the basis of his work on ''[[Fiend Without a Face]]''."The price was right, and the old guy needed a job and I hired him," recalled Cohen. "And he was exactly what I wanted and needed as a good craftsman."&lt;ref name="herman"/&gt;

A thirteen-minute prologue featuring hypnotist Emile Franchele and HypnoVista was added for the US release by James H. Nicholson of AIP, who felt the movie needed another gimmick.&lt;ref&gt;'Museum' Due Here Aug. 12
Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 09 July 1959: C9.&lt;/ref&gt; "We tested it in a few theaters, and the audience went for it like crazy...hokey as it was," recalled Cohen. "It helped make the picture a success, I guess, 'cause people were looking for gimmicks at that time."&lt;ref name="herman"/&gt;

==Release==
The film was given a wide release in the US on a double bill with ''[[The Headless Ghost]]''.&lt;ref&gt;FILM-MAKER FINDS THAT HORROR PAYS: Herman Cohen Makes Profit on Grisly Pictures -- Fox to Screen Durrell Books
By MURRAY SCHUMACH Special to The New York Times.. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 28 Apr 1959: 40.&lt;/ref&gt; It was very popular and earned over $1 million in profits.&lt;ref name="AIP"/&gt; Cohen estimated 72% of the audience for this sort of film was aged between 12 and 26.&lt;ref&gt;Teen-age Monster Maker, but Oh So Clean!
Scheuer, Philip K. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 14 Apr 1963: L3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen says when the movie was released on television they had to take off the hypnotism prologue "because it does hypnotize some people."&lt;ref name="herman"/&gt;

The film was later inducted into the [[Museum of Modern Art]] at the behest of [[Martin Scorsese]].&lt;ref&gt;Obituaries: B-movie producer Herman Cohen

'''Inspector Gabriel Hanaud''' is a fictional character depicted in a series of 6 novels and a short story by the British writer [[A. E. W. Mason]]. He has been described as the "first major fiction police detective of the Twentieth Century".&lt;ref&gt;Pitts p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

He was modelled on two real-life heads of the [[Paris]] [[Sûreté]], Macé and Goron.&lt;ref&gt;Queen p.67&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Gaboriau]]'s [[Monsieur Lecoq]] was also an acknowledged inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Bargainnier p.37-38&lt;/ref&gt; Mason wanted to physically differentiate Hanaud from [[Sherlock Holmes]] as much as possible, and so he made him stout and broad-shouldered in contrast to Holmes who was thin.&lt;ref&gt;Bargainnier p.38&lt;/ref&gt; He often relies on [[psychological]] methods to solve cases.&lt;ref&gt;Bargainnier p.36&lt;/ref&gt; Hanaud is assisted by his friend, the fastidious Mr Julius Ricardo, a former [[City of London]] financier.

Hanaud makes his first appearance in the 1910 story ''[[At the Villa Rose (novel)|At the Villa Rose]]'' set in the south of France. He appeared in a further four novels, and several short stories. His last appearance was in the 1946 novel ''[[The House in Lordship Lane]]''. Hanaud was portrayed on screen several times – with adaptations of ''[[At the Villa Rose (novel)|At the Villa Rose]]'' and its sequel ''[[The House of the Arrow (novel)|The House of the Arrow]]''.

He has been seen as one of a number of influences on the creation of [[Agatha Christie]]'s Belgian detective [[Hercule Poirot]].

'''Interracial marriage''' is a form of [[marriage]] outside a specific social group ([[exogamy]]) involving spouses who belong to different socially-defined [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] or [[Ethnic group#Ethnicity and race|racialized ethnicities]]. In the past, it was outlawed  in the [[United States of America]] and in [[South Africa]] as [[miscegenation]]. It became legal in the entire United States in 1967 when the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in the case ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' that race-based restrictions on marriages violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].

== Legality ==
{{Further information|Marriage laws|Anti-miscegenation laws}}
Many jurisdictions have had regulations banning or restricting not just interracial marriage but also interracial sexual relations, including [[Nazi Germany|Germany during the Nazi period]], [[South Africa under apartheid]], and many states in the [[United States]] prior to [[Loving v. Virginia|a 1967 Supreme Court decision]].

Interracial marriage in the [[United States]] has been fully legal in all [[U.S. state]]s since the [[Loving v. Virginia|1967 Supreme Court decision]] that deemed anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional, with many states choosing to legalize interracial marriage at much earlier dates. Anti-miscegenation laws have played a large role in defining racial identity and enforcing the racial hierarchy. The United States has many ethnic and racial groups, and interracial marriage is fairly common among most of them. Interracial marriages increased from 2% of married couples in 1970 to 7% in 2005&lt;ref name="Two or More" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18090277/ns/us_news-life/t/after-years-interracial-marriage-flourishing/ Interracial marriage flourishes in U.S. – US news – Life – Race &amp; ethnicity]. MSNBC (2007-04-15). Retrieved 9 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and 8.4% in 2010.&lt;ref name=pew2012&gt;Wang, Wendy (16 February 2012) [http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/02/16/the-rise-of-intermarriage/ "The Rise of Intermarriage"] [[Pew Research Center]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Pew Research Center analysis of census data conducted in 2013, 12% of newlyweds married someone of a different race. (This share does not take into account the "interethnic" marriages between Hispanics and non-Hispanics).&lt;ref name="pewresearch.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/12/interracial-marriage-who-is-marrying-out/ |title=Interracial marriage: Who is ‘marrying out’? |date=12 June 2015 |website=[[Pew Research Center]] |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, most Americans say they approve of racial or ethnic intermarriage – not just in the abstract, but in their own families. More than six-in-ten say it would be fine with them if a family member told them they were going to marry someone from any of three major race/ethnic groups other than their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wang |first=Wendy |title=The Rise of Intermarriage  Rates, Characteristics Vary by Race and Gender |url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/02/16/the-rise-of-intermarriage/ |work=PewSocialTrends.org |publisher=Pew Research |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some racial groups are more likely to intermarry than others. Of the 3.6 million adults who got married in 2013, 58% of Native Americans, 28% of Asians, 19% of blacks and 7% of whites have a spouse whose race was different from their own. The overall numbers mask significant gender gaps within some racial groups. 
Among blacks, men are much more likely than women to marry someone of a different race. Fully a quarter of black men who got married in 2013 married someone who was not black. Only 12% of black women married outside of their race. 
For Asians, the gender pattern goes in the opposite direction: Asian women are much more likely than Asian men to marry someone of a different race. Among newlyweds in 2013, 37% of Asian women married someone who was not Asian, while 16% of Asian men married outside of their race. However, Asian women are more likely to marry Asian men than any other men of different ethnic background.
Native Americans have the highest interracial marriage rate among all single-race groups. Women are slightly more likely to "marry out" than men in this group: 61% of Native American female newlyweds married outside their race, compared with 54% of Native American male newlyweds.&lt;ref name="pewresearch.org"/&gt;

Although the anti-miscegenation laws have been revoked, the social stigma related to Black interracial marriages still exists in today's society although to a much lesser degree. Research by Tucker and Mitchell-Kerman from 1990 has shown that Blacks intermarry far less than any other non-White group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tucker, M. B. |author2=Mitchell-Kernan, C. |jstor=352851 |title=New trends in black American interracial marriage: The social structural context |year=1990 |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=209–218 |doi=10.2307/352851}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010, only 17.1% of Blacks married interracially, a rate far lower than the rates for Hispanics and Asians.&lt;ref name=pew2012 /&gt; Black interracial marriages in particular engender problems associated with racist attitudes and perceived relational inappropriateness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hibbler, D.

ABC News&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid 19th to 20th centuries, many black people and ethnic Mexicans intermarried with each other in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in South Texas (mostly in Cameron County and Hidalga County). In Cameron County, 38% of black people were interracially married (7/18 families) while in Hidalgo County the number was 72% (18/25 families). These two counties had the highest rates of interracial marriages involving at least one black spouse in the United States. The vast majority of these marriages involved black men marrying ethnic Mexican women or first generation Tejanas (Texas-born women of Mexican descent). Since ethnic Mexicans were considered white by Texas officials and the U.S. government, such marriages were a violation of the state's anti-miscegenation laws. Yet, there is no evidence that anyone in South Texas was prosecuted for violating this law. The rates of this interracial marriage dynamic can be traced back to when black men moved into the Lower Rio Grande Valley after the Civil War ended. They married into ethnic Mexican families and joined other black people who found sanctuary on the U.S./Mexico border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackpast.org/perspectives/border-love-rio-grande-african-american-men-and-latinas-rio-grande-valley-south-texas-1 |title=Border Love on the Rio Grande: African American Men and Latinas in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas (1850–1940) |publisher=The Black Past |date=2003-06-10 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese that migrated were almost entirely of Cantonese origin. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese men in the U.S, mostly of Cantonese origin from Taishan migrated to the United States. [[Anti-miscegenation laws]] in many states prohibited Chinese men from marrying white women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=283998 Chin, Gabriel and Hrishi Karthikeyan, (2002) Asian Law Journal vol. 9 "Preserving Racial Identity: Population Patterns and the Application of Anti-Miscegenation Statutes to Asian Americans, 1910–1950"]. Papers.ssrn.com. Retrieved 29 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], many intermarriages in some states were not recorded and historically, Chinese American men married African American women in high proportions to their total marriage numbers due to few Chinese American women being in the United States. After the Emancipation Proclamation, many Chinese Americans immigrated to the Southern states, particularly Arkansas, to work on plantations. For example, in 1880, the tenth [[US Census]] of [[Louisiana]] alone counted 57% of interracial marriages between these Chinese to be with black and 43% to be with white women.&lt;ref name="The United States"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colorq.org/MeltingPot/article.aspx?d=America&amp;x=ChineseBlacks |title=The United States |work=Chinese blacks in the Americas |publisher=Color Q World |accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 20 and 30 percent of the Chinese who lived in Mississippi married black women before 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Susan Dente Ross |author2=Paul Martin Lester |title=Images That Injure: Pictorial Stereotypes in the Media |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpIHIKUS-e0C&amp;pg=PA144 |accessdate=2 March 2012 |date=19 April 2011 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-37892-8 |pages=144–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a genetic study of 199 samples from African American males found one belong to haplogroup O2a ( or 0.5% )&lt;ref&gt;Evaluation of Group Genetic Ancestry of Populations from Philadelphia and Dakar in the Context of Sex-Biased Admixture in the Americas Stefflova K, Dulik MC, Pai AA, Walker AH, Zeigler-Johnson CM, Gueye SM, Schurr TG, Rebbeck TR – PLoS ONE (2009).

Gates speculated that the intermarriage/relations between migrant Chinese workers during the 19th century and black, or African-American slaves or ex-slaves may have contributed to her ethnic genetic make-up.
In the mid 1850s, 70 to 150 Chinese were living in New York City and 11 of them married Irish women. In 1906 the ''New York Times'' (6 August) reported that 300 white women (Irish American) were married to Chinese men in New York, with many more cohabited. In 1900, based on Liang research, of the 120,000 men in more than 20 Chinese communities in the United States, he estimated that one out of every twenty Chinese men (Cantonese) was married to white women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Benson Tong |title=Asian American children: a historical handbook and guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uK6xhcu-4hAC&amp;pg=PA38 |accessdate=2 March 2012 |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-33042-1 |pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s census showed 3500 Chinese men married to white women and 2900 Chinese women married to white men.

==== Hawaii ====
The majority of the [[Hawaiian Chinese]] were [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] migrants from [[Guangdong]] with minority of [[Hakka people|Hakka]] descent also from Guangdong. If all people with Chinese ancestry in Hawaii (including the Chinese-Hawaiians) are included, they form about 1/3 of Hawaii's entire population. Many thousands of them married women of Hawaiian, Hawaiian/European and European origin. A large percentage of the Chinese men married Hawaiian and Hawaiian/European women, while a minority married white women in Hawaii who were of [[Portuguese American|Portuguese]] descent. The 12,592 Asiatic-Hawaiians enumerated in 1930 were the result of Chinese men intermarrying with Hawaiian and part Hawaiian/Europeans. Most Asiatic-Hawaiian men also married Hawaiians and European women (and vice versa). On the census, some Chinese with little "native blood" would be classified as Chinese – not as Asiatic-Hawaiians – due to "dilution of native blood". Intermarriage started to decline in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a904831799 |title=Interethnic Marriage and Divorce in Hawaii A Panel Study of 1968 First Marriages |author=Schwertfeger, Margaret M. |year=1982 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese and other Caucasian women married Chinese men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_j2lXoxMIiAC&amp;pg=PA254 |title=Divorce: crisis, challenge, or relief? |author1=David Anthony Chiriboga |author2=Linda S.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, 2011, 4.6% of all civil unions are interracial ones, an 18% increase from 2006 (3.9%), and a 77% increase from 1991 (2.6%).&lt;ref name="StatCan2011"&gt;[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/as-sa/99-010-x/99-010-x2011003_3-eng.cfm Mixed unions in Canada (2011)]. Retrieved 22 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vancouver]] reported the highest rate of interracial unions, at 9.6%, and [[Toronto]] in second place at 8.2%. Major census metropolitan areas had higher frequencies of mixed unions (6.0%) compared to areas that were not classified as such (1.0%). Younger people were more likely to be in a mixed union;  the highest proportion of couples in mixed unions was among persons aged 25 to 34 (7.7%), 35 to 44 (6.8%), 15 to 24 (6.1%), 45 to 54 (4.1%), and 55 and over (2.7%).&lt;ref name="StatCan2011" /&gt;

The 2006 study had an interesting find, that people born in Canada were more likely to marry someone of another race as opposed to those who immigrated there;&lt;ref name="StatCan"&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-008-x/2010001/article/11143-eng.htm#a3 A portrait of couples in mixed unions]. Retrieved 28 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; only 12% of first generation immigrant visible minorities were in a mixed union, this figure is higher for second generation immigrants (51%) and three or more generation immigrants (69%). There are a few examples of this:
# 63% of Canadian-born Blacks (who were in couples) were in mixed unions, while the numbers for Blacks born in the Caribbean and Bermuda (17%), and Africa (13%) were much lower percentages.
# For Chinese people born in Canada, 54% (who were in couples) were with someone non-Chinese (it's not noted if this figure refers to anyone who is not East Asian (race), or just not Chinese (nationality)), compared to only 3% of those born in China who immigrated to Canada.
# 33% of South Asian Canadians who were born in Canada, were in a mixed union, compared to only 3% of those who were born in South Asia.

One theory for this may include that those who immigrate as adults, may have already found a partner before immigrating to Canada.&lt;ref name="StatCan" /&gt;

Certain visible minority groups had higher rates of being in mixed unions;
* 78.7% of [[Japanese Canadian|Japanese]]
* 64.9% of multiracial people
* 48.2% of [[Latin American Canadian|Latin Americans]]
* 40.2% of [[Black Canadian|Blacks]]
* 29.8% of [[Filipino Canadian|Filipinos]]
* 25.4% of [[Arab Canadian|Arabs]] / [[West Asians]]
* 22.5% of [[Korean Canadian|Koreans]]
* 21.9% of [[Southeast Asians]] (other than Filipinos)
* 19.4% of [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]]
* 13.0% of [[South Asian Canadian|South Asians]]
* 52.4% of other groups;

There are no statistics that show data for [[European Canadians|Whites]] or [[Aboriginal Canadians|Aboriginals]].

The 2006 study also stated that same-sex couples are about 2.5 times more likely to be in an interracial marriage as opposed to opposite-sex couples, 9.8% of same-sex marriages are interracial.&lt;ref name="StatCan" /&gt; There were some theories as to why; [[same-sex marriage in Canada]] become legal in 2005, whereas opposite sex marriage was always legal, and it also mentions that same-sex couples are more likely to be in [[common-law marriage]]s, and common-law marriages had a higher frequency of mixed unions.

One study done by Reg Bibby found that 92% of Canadians are accepting of interracial marriages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Douglas+Todd+forces+against+mixed+marriage/8939561/story.html Douglas Todd: The forces for and against mixed marriage]. Retrieved 28 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latin America ===
In [[Latin America]], most of the population are descended from [[Amerindians]], [[Europe]]ans and [[Africans]]. They formed the [[Mestizo]] and [[Mulatto]] populations that populate the countries in Latin America. Intermarriage and inter-relations occurred on a larger scale than most places in the world. In some countries, [[Asian people|Asian]] immigrants have also intermarried among the groups. About 300,000 [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] coolies and migrants (almost all males) were shipped 1849 to 1874 Latin America, many of them intermarried and cohabited with the Black, Mestizo, and European population of Cuba, Peru, Guyana, Trinidad.
Around 20,000 Mostly Cantonese and some [[Hakka people|Hakka]] coolies migrated to Jamaica, Guyana, Trinidad. Many of them also intermarried with Black women and East Indian women. Unlike in Trinidad Tobago and Guyana who were predominantly Cantonese men who intermarried with Black women and Indian women. In Jamaica, the Chinese who married Black women were mostly Hakka. According to the 1946 Census from Jamaica and Trinidad alone, 12,394 Chinese were located between [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad]]. 5,515 of those who lived in [[Jamaica]] were Chinese Jamaican and another 3,673 were Chinese-Trinidadians living in [[Trinidad]].&lt;ref name="The United States"/&gt; In Jamaica and other Caribbean nations as well many Chinese males over past generations took up African wives, gradually assimilating or absorbing many Chinese descendants into the African Caribbean community or the overall mixed-race community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://motherearthtravel.com/guyana/population.htm Population of Guyana].

In Guyana, the prospect of sexual relations with [[Indo-Guyanese|Indian]] women was at first unappealing to the mostly male [[Chinese Guyanese|Chinese]] migrants like in [[Mauritian of Chinese origin#Migration history|Mauritius]] although there was a lack of Chinese women, but eventually their attitude changed and Indian women and Chinese men established sexual relationships with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=272–273 |year=1995 |accessdate=1 June 2015 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP |volume=Volume 22 of McGill-Queen's studies in ethnic history |issn=0846-8869 |edition=illustrated |author=Brian L.

In Trinidad some [[Chinese Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Chinese men]] had sexual relations [[Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Indian coolie women]], siring children with them, and it was reported that "A few children are to be met with born of Madras and Creole parents and some also of Madras and Chinese parents – the Madrasee being the mother", by the missionary John Morton in 1876, Morton noted that it seemed strange since there were more Indian coolie men than Indian coolie women that Indian coolie women would marry Chinese men, but claimed it was most likely because the Chinese could provide amenities to the women since the Chinese owned shops and they were enticed by these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=14 |pages= |year=2014 |accessdate=1 June 2015 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |volume= |issn= |edition= |editor=Julitta Rydlewska |editor2=Barbara Braid |title=Unity in Diversity, Volume 1: Cultural Paradigm and Personal Identity, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WBVQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=some+also+of+madras+and+chinese+parents+the+madrasee+being+the+mother |archiveurl=http://www.cambridgescholars.com/download/sample/61376 |archivedate=2014 |isbn=1-4438-6729-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=238 |pages= |year=1995 |accessdate=1 June 2015 |publisher=Nycan |edition= |author=Dennison Moore |quote= |location= |title=Origins and Development of Racial Ideology in Trinidad |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kTV7AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=some+also+of+madras+and+chinese+parents+the+madrasee+being+the+mother&amp;q=being+mother |isbn=0-9680060-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=263 |pages= |year=1999 |accessdate=1 June 2015 |publisher=Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social and Economic Studies, The University of the West Indies |volume= |issn= |edition= |author=Selwyn D.

The situation in Trinidad and British Guiana with Indian women being fewer than Indian men led to Indian women using the situation to their advantage by leaving their partners for other men, leading to a high incidence of "wife murders" by Indian men on their wives, and Indian women and culture were branded as "immoral" by European observers, an Indian man named Mohammad Orfy petitioned as a representative of "destitute Indian men of Trinidad", to the colonial authorities, complaining of Indian women's behavior and claiming that it was "a perforating plague.....the high percentage of immoral lives led by the female section of our community......to satisfy the greed and lust of the male section of quite a different race to theirs........[Indian women] are enticed, seduced and frightened into becoming concubines, and paramours.......

In British Guiana and Trinidad, white overseers and managers would take advantage of Indian coolie women and use them in sexual relationships, the Indian women were then blamed for these incidents and viewed as allegedly "loose" and promiscuous by colonial officials, and Indian women were subjected to a high rate of "wife murders" by Indian men, the Indian women were also blamed for this due to their "inconstancy" due to alleged low "sexual morality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=110 |edition=illustrated |pages= |year=2011 |accessdate=17 May 2014 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |volume= |author=Tejaswini Niranjana |editor=Faith L.

About 100,000 Cantonese-Chinese coolies (almost all males) in 1849 to 1874 migrated to Peru and intermarried with Peruvian women of mestizo, European, Amerindian, European/mestizo, African and mulatto origin. Many Peruvian Chinese today are of mixed Chinese, Spanish, African, Amerindian. Estimates for Chinese-Peruvian is about 1.3 – 1.6 millions. Asian Peruvians are estimated to be 3% of the population, but one source places the number of citizens with some Chinese ancestry at 4.2 million, which equates to 15% of the country's total population.

120,000 Cantonese coolies (all males) entered Cuba under contract for 80 years, most did not marry, but Hung Hui (1975) cites there was frequent sexual activity between black women and Cantonese coolies. According to Osberg (1965) the free Chinese conducted the practice of buying slave women and freeing them expressly for marriage. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Chinese men (Cantonese) engaged in sexual activity with white Cuban women and black Cuban women, and from such relations many children were born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.upf.edu/mon/assig/xialmo/mat/dorsey_4.pdf |doi=10.1177/0094582X04264492 |title=Identity, Rebellion, and Social Justice Among Chinese Contract Workers in Nineteenth-Century Cuba |year=2004 |last1=Dorsey |first1=Joseph C. |journal=Latin American Perspectives |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=18–47 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220035052/http://www.upf.edu/mon/assig/xialmo/mat/dorsey_4.pdf |archivedate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 22 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Barbary pirate]]s from North Africa captured and enslaved 1.25 million white slaves from [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]] between the 16th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="osu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mediterranean" /&gt; Outside the Arab world, it was also common for [[Muslim conquests|Arab conquerors]], [[Islamic economics in the world|traders]] and [[Geography in medieval Islam|explorers]] to intermarry with local females in the lands they conquered or traded with, in various different parts of Africa, Asia (see [[#Asia|Asia]] section) and Europe (see [[#Europe|Europe]] section).

From AD 839, [[Viking]] [[Varangian]] mercenaries who were in the service of the [[Byzantine Empire]], notably [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Sigurdsson]], campaigned in [[North Africa]], [[Jerusalem]] and other places in the [[Middle East]] during the [[Byzantine-Arab Wars]]. They interbred with the local population as spoils of warfare or through eventual settling with many [[Scandinavia]]n Viking men taking [[Arab]] or [[Anatolia]]n women as wives. There is [[archaeological]] evidence the Vikings had established contact with the city of [[Baghdad]], at the time the center of the [[Caliphate|Islamic Empire]], and connected with the populace there.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1" /&gt; Regularly plying the Volga with their trade goods (furs, tusks, seal fat, seal boats and notably female slaves; the one period in the history of the slave-trade when females were priced higher than males), the Vikings were active in the Arab slave trade at the time.&lt;ref name="Smelly Old History: Vile Vikings" /&gt; These slaves, most often Europeans that were captured from the coasts of Europe or during war periods,&lt;ref&gt;Mushin, D. (1998) [http://www.columbia.edu/itc/history/conant/mushin1998.pdf The Saqaliba Slaves in the Aghlabid State].&lt;/ref&gt; and sold to Arabic traders in [[Al-Andalus]] and the [[Emirate of Sicily]].

Intermarriage was accepted in Arab society, though only if the husband was Muslim. It was a fairly common theme in medieval [[Arabic literature]] and [[Persian literature]]. For example, the [[Persian people|Persian]] poet [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], who married his Central Asian [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]] slave girl, wrote ''The Seven Beauties'' (1196). Its [[frame story]] involves a [[Persian Empire|Persian]] prince marrying seven foreign princesses, who are [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[China|Chinese]], [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]], [[Khwarezm]]ian, [[Maghreb]]ian, [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Tatars|Tartar]]. ''[[Hadith Bayad wa Riyad]]'', a 12th-century Arabic tale from [[Al-Andalus]], was a love story involving an [[Iberians|Iberian]] girl and a [[Damascus|Damascene]] man. The ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale of "[[The Ebony Horse]]" involves the [[List of kings of Persia|Prince of Persia]], Qamar al-Aqmar, rescuing his lover, the Princess of [[Sana'a]], from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Emperor]] who also wishes to marry her.&lt;ref name="The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia" /&gt;

At times, some marriages would have a major impact on the politics of the region. The most notable example was the marriage of [[As-Salih Ayyub]], the [[Sultan]] of the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Ayyubid dynasty]], to [[Shajar al-Durr]], a slave of [[Turkic people|Turkic]] origin from Central Asia. Following her husband's death, she became the [[Sultana (title)|Sultana]] of [[Egypt]] and the first [[Mamluk]] ruler.

[[Africa]] has a long history of interracial mixing with [[Arabs]] and later [[Europe]]ans having sexual relations with black Africans. [[Arabs]] played a big role in the African [[slave]] trade and unlike the trans-Atlantic trade most of the black African slaves in the Arab slave trade were women. Most of them were used as [[sex slave|sexual]] slaves by the Arab men and some were taken as wives.

In the former Lusophone Africa (now known as [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Cape Verde]]) racial mixing between white [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and black Africans was fairly common, especially in Cape Verde, where the majority of the population is of mixed descent.

There have been several cases of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] merchants and laborers marrying black African women as many Chinese workers were employed to build railways and other infrastructural projects in Africa. These labour groups were made up completely of men with very few Chinese women coming to [[Africa]]. In [[Réunion]] and [[Madagascar]], intermarriage between Chinese men of Cantonese origin and African women is not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pan|1994|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Southern Africa ====
There is a significant mixed race population, the result of mostly European and African unions, in South Africa, called [[Coloured]]s. The term Coloured is also used to describe persons of mixed race in the neighbouring nation of Namibia, to refer to those of part Khoisan, part black and part white descent. The [[Baster]]s constitute a separate ethnic group that are sometimes considered a sub-group of the Coloured population of the country.

Some of the [[Xhosa people]] claim descent from white people. The royal family of the [[ImiDushane]], for example, is descended from Queen Gquma of the [[Mpondo]], a white orphan that was adopted by a Xhosa chief after a shipwreck killed her parents. She later married an Mpondo prince, became his [[Great Wife|great wife]], and served as queen during his reign as king of the Tshomane Mpondo. 

Interracial marriage was banned under apartheid. Due to this, there was considerable opposition to the marriage between Sir [[Seretse Khama]], Paramount Chief of the [[Bamangwato]] Tswanas, and his eventual wife [[Ruth Williams Khama]], Lady Khama, even though Chief Khama was Motswana and not South African. 

Today there are a number of high-profile interracial couples in Southern Africa, such as the unions of [[Mmusi Maimane]] (a black opposition politician who serves as the [[Leader of the Opposition]] of South Africa) and his white wife Natalie Maimane, [[Matthew Booth (soccer)|Matthew Booth]] (a white [[soccer]] player) and his wife Sonia Bonneventia (a black former Miss South Africa first princess and international model)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/simonaustin/2009/08/south_africas_white_knight.html Simon Austin: South Africa's white knight].

==== Mauritius ====

==== West Africa ====
In West Africa, a series of interracial marriages and relationships created a number of mixed race families in the various countries of the region.

In [[Sierra Leone]], marriages between representatives of British trading firms and princesses of the [[Sherbro people]] created a number of aristocratic families such as the [[Sherbro Tuckers]] and the [[Caulker (surname)|Sherbro Caulkers]]. Due to matrilineality, they have maintained their claims to their ancestral thrones.

In [[Benin]], meanwhile, the descendants of the Brazilian slavetrader [[Francisco Felix de Sousa]] and his harem of black consorts have contributed a number of prominent citizens. Figures such as a president ([[Paul-Emile de Souza]]) and a first lady ([[Thomas Boni Yayi#Personal life|Chantal de Souza Boni Yayi]], President de Souza's niece) are arguably the most notable of them.

In [[Ghana]], a number of founding fathers had relationships with foreigners of other races: [[Kwame Nkrumah]] married the Egyptian [[Copt]] [[Fathia Nkrumah]] and raised a family with her. Their children would go on to become politicians like their father. President Nkrumah's contemporary and sometime friend, [[Joe Appiah]], was himself married to the British debutante [[Peggy Cripps|Peggy Cripps Appiah]]. At the start of the 21st century, their descendants were being led by their only son, [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]]. In addition to this, Dr. [[J. B. Danquah]] had a son with a British woman during his time in Britain. He would go on to become noted actor [[Paul Danquah]].

In [[Gabon]], a woman by the name of Germaine Anina - daughter of a Gabonese tribal chief - married a Chinese trader and politician named Cheng Zhiping. Their son, [[Jean Ping]], went on to serve as a minister in his mother's native country.

Lastly, a number of the first ladies in [[Francophone West Africa]] have been French: [[Leopold Sedar Senghor#Personal life and death|Collette Hubert Senghor]] and [[Viviane Wade]] of [[Senegal]], and [[Dominique Ouattara]] of [[Ivory Coast]].

== Australia ==
{{See also|Demographics of Australia}}

The Australian Government does not release information on the ethnicities of marriage partners, but provide information on their countries of birth.
* In 2009 there were 120,118 marriages recorded in Australia. About 42% involved at least one partner who was not Australian-born.
* 15% of Australian-born women, and 17.4% of Australian-born men, married somebody who was not Australian-born.
* American (68%), Greek (62%) and Irish-born (62%) women were the most likely to marry an Australian-born man than a man born elsewhere.
* Indian (12%), Chinese (16%) and 'other South and East Asia'-born (16%) women were the least likely to marry an Australian-born man than a man born elsewhere.
* American (63%), Lebanese (62%) and Irish-born (62%) men were the most likely to marry an Australian-born woman than a woman born elsewhere.
* Chinese (2%), 'other North Asia' (7%) and Vietnamese-born (8%) men were the least likely to marry an Australian-born woman than a woman born elsewhere.
* Chinese-born men were the most likely to marry a woman from the same country (91%).

[[Indigenous Australians]] have a high interracial marriage rate. According to the 2000 Census in 1996, 64% of all married or ''de facto'' married couples involving an Indigenous person were mixed (i.e., only one partner was indigenous). In 55% of such couples, the Indigenous partner was female.&lt;ref name="4102.0" /&gt;

Most of the early Chinese-Australia population was formed by Cantonese migrants from Guangzhou and Taishan, including some from Fujian, who came during the goldrush period of the 1850s. Marriage records show that between the 1850s and around the start of the 20th century, there were about 2000 legal marriages between white women and migrant Chinese men in Australia's eastern colonies, probably with similar numbers involved in de facto relationships of various kinds (ex: cohabitation, sexual intimacy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://epress.anu.edu.au/anu_lives/transnational/html/ch07s02.html Australian wives in China]. Epress.anu.edu.au (1904-03-01). Retrieved 9 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of intermarriages declined, as stories of viciousness and the seduction of white women grew, mixed with opposition to intermarriage. Rallies against Chinese men taking white women became widespread, as many Australian men saw the Chinese men intermarrying and cohabiting with white women as a threat to the white race. In late 1878 there were 181 marriages between European women and Chinese men, and 171 couples cohabiting without matrimony, resulting in 586 Eurasian children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=G. W.

===Central Asia===

Today [[Central Asia]]ns are a mixture of various peoples, such as [[Mongol people|Mongols]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]]. The Mongol invasion of Central Asia in the 13th century resulted in the massacre of the mostly Iranic population and other [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European people]] with intermarriage and assimilation. Modern genetic studies show that Central Asian Turkic people and Hazara are a mixture of Northeast Asians and Indo-European people. Caucasian ancestry is prevalent in almost all central Asian Turkic people. Kazakhs, Hazara, Karakalpaks, and Crimean Tatars have more European maternal Mtdna than European paternal Y-dna while Kyrgyz have more European Y-dna with substantial European Mtdna. Other Turkic people like Uyghurs, Uzbeks, have mostly European Y-dna but also high percentages of European Mtdna. Turkmen have predominantly European Y-dna and Mtdna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Zerjal |first1=T. |last2=Wells |first2=R.

Interracial marriage between Turkic, European, Central Asians in [[Kazakhstan]] are rare but increasing. The most common marriages are between Kazakh and [[Volga Tatars]]. Intermarriage usually involves Kazakh men, due to Muslim tradition favouring male over female. For example, 1% were between Russians, Tatars, and Kazakhs (792 between Russians and Tatars, 561 between Kazakhs and Tatars, and 212 between Kazakhs and Russians). 701 Kazakh men married Russians or Tatars, against only 72 Kazakh women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtNXAAAAYAAJ |title=ABSEES - Soviet and East European Abstracts Series |date=1 January 1974 |publisher=ABSEES |accessdate=22 October 2017 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Kirgiz men living in Uzbekistan and married to non-Kirgiz women, 9.6% had married Russians, 25.6% Uzbeks, and 34.3% Tatars.

==== China ====

There have been various periods in the [[history of China]] where a number of [[Arab]]s, [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] from the [[Western Regions]] ([[Central Asia]] and [[West Asia]]) migrated to [[China]]. Persians intermarried around the time of Manichaeism's spread to China before the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]]. Moreover, Persians brought Buddhism to China and there is evidence of close relationship during its pre-Islamic times (see [[An Shigao]]).

Moreover, the arrival of [[Islam during the Tang Dynasty]] in the 7th century brought an influx of immigrants. Due to the majority of these immigrants being male, many intermarried with [[Chinese people|Chinese]] females. Intermarriage was initially discouraged by the [[Tang Dynasty]]. In 836 Lu Chun was appointed as governor of Canton, and was disgusted to find the Chinese living with foreigners and intermarrying. Lu enforced separation, banned interracial marriages, and made it illegal for foreigners to own property. Lu Chun believed his principles were just and upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edward H. Schafer |title=The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T'Ang Exotics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqAGIL02BWQC&amp;pg=PA22 |year=1985 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-05462-2 |pages=22–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 836 law specifically banned Chinese from forming relationships with "dark peoples" or "people of colour", which was used to describe foreigners, such as "Iranians, Sogdians, Arabs, Indians, Malays, Sumatrans", among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=A history of Chinese civilization |author=Jacques Gernet |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-49781-7 |page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Song Dynasty]] allowed [[Immigrant generations|third-generation immigrants]] with official titles to intermarry with Chinese imperial princesses.&lt;ref name="colorq" /&gt;

In 779, the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced [[Uyghur people|Uighurs]] to wear their ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying Chinese females, and banned them from pretending to be Chinese. The magistrate who issued the orders may have wanted to protect "purity" in Chinese custom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jqAGIL02BWQC&amp;pg=PA22 |title=The golden peaches of Samarkand: a study of Tʻang exotics |author=Edward H. Schafer |year=1963 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-05462-8 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Han men also married Turkic [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] women in Xinjiang from 1880 to 1949. Sometimes poverty influenced Uyghur women to marry Han men. These marriages were not recognized by local [[mullah]]s since Muslim women were not allowed to marry non-Muslim men under Islamic law. This did not stop the women because they enjoyed advantages: they were not subject to Islamic law and not subjected to certain taxes. Uyghur women married to Han men also did not have to wear a [[veil]], and they received their husband's property upon his death. These women were forbidden from having burial in Muslim graves. The children of Han men and Uyghur women were considered to be Uyghur. Some Han soldiers had Uyghur women as temporary wives, and after their service was up, the wife was left behind or sold. If it was possible, sons were taken, and daughters were sold.&lt;ref name="Community matters in Xinjiang, 1880–1949: towards a historical anthropology of the Uyghur" /&gt;

Iranian, Arab and Turkic women also occasionally migrated to China and mixed with Chinese. Iranian women dancers were in demand in China during this period.

===== Hong Kong =====
{{Main article|Tanka people}}

Many Tanka women bore children with foreign men. Ernest John Eitel mentioned in 1889 how an important change had taken place among Eurasian girls, the offspring of illicit connections: instead of becoming concubines, they were commonly brought up respectably and married to Hong Kong Chinese husbands. Some believed many Hong Kong-born Eurasians were assimilated into the Hong Kong society by intermarriage with the [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] population. The world's most influential martial artist icon, [[Bruce Lee]], was also born to parents of Hong Kong heritage to a Cantonese father and a Eurasian mother. Some European women also married with Cantonese such as Hollywood sex symbol [[Nancy Kwan]] born to a [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] architect,&lt;ref name="Lee201"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|2000|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Marquita Scott, a Caucasian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/2014/02/10/140210goli_GOAT_theatre_als |title=Exit the Dragon |publisher=New Yorker |date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; model of English and Scottish ancestry.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite news |title=Is Graduate of Royal Ballet |author=Robinson, Johnny |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1913&amp;dat=19630518&amp;id=47c0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wGkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3319,2014523 |newspaper=Lewiston Evening Journal |location=Lewiston, Maine |date=18 May 1963 |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Nancy Kwan is "half-Chinese, three-eighths English, one-eighth Scot, blended with a touch of Malayan".&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;|group="note"}}

Ernest John Eitel controversially claimed that most "half-caste" people in Hong Kong were descended exclusively from Europeans having relationships with [[Tanka people|Tanka women]]. The theory that most of the Eurasian mixed-race Hong Kong people are descended only from Tanka women and European men, and not ordinary Cantonese women, has been backed up by other researchers who pointed out that Tanka women freely consorted with foreigners because they were not bound by the same Confucian traditions as the Cantonese, and having relationships with European men was advantageous for Tanka women, but Lethbridge criticized it as "a 'myth' propagated by xenophobic Cantonese to account for the establishment of the Hong Kong Eurasian community". Carl Smith's study in the late 1960s on the protected women seems, to some degree, to support Eitel's theory. Smith says that the Tankas experienced certain restrictions within the traditional Chinese social structure. Being a group marginal to the traditional Chinese society of the Puntis (Cantonese), they did not have the same social pressure in dealing with Europeans. The ordinary Cantonese women did not sleep with European men; the Eurasian population was formed mostly from Tanka and European admixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Meiqi Lee |title=Being Eurasian: memories across racial divides |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVGd71y1Y-0C&amp;pg=PA262 |year=2004 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |isbn=962-209-671-9 |page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Maria Jaschok |editor2=Suzanne Miers |title=Women and Chinese patriarchy: submission, servitude, and escape |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f5o_t7VxHYAC&amp;pg=PA223 |year=1994 |publisher=Zed Books |isbn=1-85649-126-9 |page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Helen F.

They invaded Hongkong the moment the settlement was started, living at first on boats in the harbon with their numerons families, and gradually settling on shore. They have maintained ever since almost a monopoly of the supply of pilots and ships' crews, of the fish trade and the cattle trade, but unfortunately also of the trade in girls and women. Strange to say, when the settlement was first started, it was estimated that some 2,000 of these Tan-ka lieople had flocked to Hongkong, but at the present time they are abont the same number, a tendency having set in among them to settle on shore rather than on the water and to disavow their Tan-ka extraction in order to mix on equal terms with the mass of the Chinese community. The half-caste population in Hongkong were, from the earliest days of the settlement of the Colony and down to the present day, almost exclusively the off-spring of these Tan-ka people.

After the handover of Macau to China in 1999 many Macanese migrated to other countries. Many of the Portuguese and Macanese women who stayed in Macau married local Cantonese men, and many Macanese also now have Cantonese paternal heritage. There are between 25,000 – 46,000 Macanese, only 5000 – 8000 of whom live in Macau, while most live in America, Latin America, and Portugal. Unlike the Macanese of Macau who are strictly of Chinese and Portuguese heritage, many Macanese living abroad are not entirely of Portuguese and Chinese ancestry. Many Macanese men and women intermarried with the local population of America and Latin America, etc., and have only partial Macanese heritage.

A large-scale slave trade developed in which Portuguese purchased Japanese as slaves in Japan and sold them to various locations overseas, including Portugal itself, throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=HOFFMAN |first=MICHAEL |date=26 May 2013 |title=The rarely, if ever, told story of Japanese sold as slaves by Portuguese traders |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2013/05/26/books/the-rarely-if-ever-told-story-of-japanese-sold-as-slaves-by-portuguese-traders/ |newspaper=The Japan Times |location= |publisher= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 May 2007 |title=Europeans had Japanese slaves, in case you didn't know&amp;nbsp;... |url=http://www.japanprobe.com/2007/05/10/europeans-had-japanese-slaves-in-case-you-didnt-know/ |newspaper=Japan Probe |location= |publisher= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many documents mention the large slave trade along with protests against the enslavement of Japanese. Japanese slaves are believed to be the first of their nation to end up in Europe, and the Portuguese purchased many Japanese slave girls to bring to Portugal for sexual purposes, as noted by the Church in 1555. King Sebastian feared that it was having a negative effect on Catholic proselytization since the slave trade in Japanese was growing to massive proportions, so he commanded that it be banned in 1571.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=25066328 |title=Monumenta Nipponica (Slavery in Medieval Japan) |last=Nelson |first=Thomas |volume=59 |number=No. 4 |date=Winter 2004 |page=463 |publisher=Sophia University.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Sophia University |year=2004 |location= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XoQMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Portuguese+and+other+Occidental+sources+are+replete+with+records+of+the+export+of+Japanese+slaves+in+the+second+half+of+the+sixteenth+century.+A+few+examples+should+serve+to+illustrate+this+point.+Very+probably,+the+first+Japanese+who+set+foot+in+Europe+were+slaves.+As+early+as+1555,+complaints+were+made+by+the+Church+that+Portuguese+merchants+were+taking+Japanese+slave+girls+with+them+back+to+Portugal+and+living+with+them+there+in+sin.+By+1571,+the+trade+was+being+conducted+on+such+a+scale+that+King+Sebastian+of+Portugal+felt+obliged+to+issue+an+order+prohibiting+it+lest+it+hinder+Catholic+missionary+activity+in+Kyushsu.&amp;dq=Portuguese+and+other+Occidental+sources+are+replete+with+records+of+the+export+of+Japanese+slaves+in+the+second+half+of+the+sixteenth+century.+A+few+examples+should+serve+to+illustrate+this+point.+Very+probably,+the+first+Japanese+who+set+foot+in+Europe+were+slaves.+As+early+as+1555,+complaints+were+made+by+the+Church+that+Portuguese+merchants+were+taking+Japanese+slave+girls+with+them+back+to+Portugal+and+living+with+them+there+in+sin.+By+1571,+the+trade+was+being+conducted+on+such+a+scale+that+King+Sebastian+of+Portugal+felt+obliged+to+issue+an+order+prohibiting+it+lest+it+hinder+Catholic+missionary+activity+in+Kyushsu. |quote= |volume= |page=463 |title=Monumenta Nipponica: Studies on Japanese Culture, Past and Present, Volume 59, Issues 3-4 |isbn= |others=Jōchi Daigaku |edition= |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian S. Kuznetsov, dean of the Department of History of the [[Irkutsk State University]], one of the first researchers of the topic, interviewed thousands of former internees and came to the following conclusion: What is more, romantic relations between Japanese internees and Russian women were not uncommon. For example, in the city of [[Kansk]], [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], about 50 Japanese married locals and stayed. Today many Russian women married Japanese men, often for the benefit of long-term residence and work rights.  Some of their mixed offspring stay in Japan while other's to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Crossing National Borders: Human Migration Issues in Northeast Asia | editor1-first=Tsuneo | editor1-last=Akaha | editor2-first=Anna | editor2-last=Vassilieva | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xrroO9pxJxcC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=Japanese+russian+marriage&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdqdHL-JfVAhXpC8AKHRrcDSgQ6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Japanese%20russian%20marriage&amp;f=false | page=112 | publisher=United Nations University Press | year=2005 | isbn=9789280811179 | accessdate=18 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, there were 740,191 marriages in Japan, of which 28,831 involved a non-Japanese bride and 7,208 involved a non-Japanese groom. Non-Japanese women who married a Japanese man were predominantly of [[China|Chinese]] (10,242), [[The Philippines|Filipino]] (7,794), [[South Korea|Korean]] (5,318), [[Thailand|Thai]] (1,445) and [[Brazil]]ian (296) nationality.

In 2006 there were 735,132 marriages in Japan, of which 40,154 involved a non-Japanese bride and 8,708 involved a non-Japanese groom. Non-Japanese women who married a Japanese-born man were predominantly of Filipino (12,150), Chinese (12,131), Korean (6,041), Thai (1,676) and Brazilian (285).

==== Korea ====
{{Main article|Marriage in South Korea}}
There were 43,121 international marriages between Koreans and non-Koreans in 2005, up 21.6% from a year earlier, according to Korea National Statistics Office&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nso.go.kr/ 통계청 홈페이지 주소변경 안내]. Nso.go.kr (2009-01-09). Retrieved 9 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; data published in the ''Korea Times'' newspaper on 30 March 2006. 11% of couples who married in 2007 were international couples. The majority of them involve South Korean males married to foreign females,&lt;ref name="Greets" /&gt; from [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Vietnam]], the [[Philippines]], [[United States]], [[Mongolia]], [[Thailand]], and [[Russia]]. However, majority of these brides are ethnic [[Koreans in China|Koreans from China]] and [[Han Chinese]].&lt;ref name="naver" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; The most common explanation for this phenomenon is that there is a lack of South Korean women who are willing to marry men living in rural areas. Since the 1960s, young women had an incentive to move from countryside to the city due to the desire of chasing a better life. Hence, there are only young men remaining in their hometown to look after their farm and keep the agriculture industry going.

In recent times, about one third of South Korean men in rural areas married women from abroad, according to Korea National Statistics Office data published in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060529051426/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200603/200603300034.html More Koreans Marry Foreigners or Tie the Knot Again]. Chosun Ilbo (30 March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Marriages between South Korean men and foreign women are often arranged by [[marriage agency|marriage brokers]] or international religious groups. There is mounting evidence to suggest that there is a statistically higher level of poverty, violence and divorce in the Korean men married to foreign women cohort.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; Most Korean men who marry Southeast Asian women end up with divorces due [[Korean_nationalism#Ethnic_nationalism|differences in beliefs]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Currently divorces between Koreans and foreign spouses make up 10% of the total Korean divorce rate.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Interracial marriage in [[Korea]] dates back to at least the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] period. Records about the period, in particular the section in the ''[[Samguk Yusa]]'' about the [[Geumgwan Gaya|Gaya kingdom]] (it was absorbed by the kingdom of [[Silla]] later), indicate that in 48&amp;nbsp;AD, King Kim [[Suro of Gaya]] (the progenitor of the [[Gimhae Kim]] clan) took a princess ([[Heo Hwang-ok]]) from the "Ayuta nation" (which is the Korean name for the city of [[Ayodhya]] in [[North India]]) as his bride and queen.&lt;ref name="korea" /&gt; Two major Korean clans today claim descent from this union.&lt;ref name="kimhaekims" /&gt;

Somewhat later, during the arrival of [[Islam in Korea|Muslims in Korea]] in the [[Middle Ages]], a number of [[Arab]], [[Persian people|Persian]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] navigators and traders settled in Korea. They took local [[Korean people|Korean]] wives and established several Muslim villages.&lt;ref name="relations" /&gt; Some [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] into [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhism]] and [[Korean Shamanism|Shamanism]] eventually took place, owing to Korea's geographical isolation from the [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref name="Muslim in Korea" /&gt; At least two or three major Korean clans today claim descent from Muslim families.&lt;ref name="Grayson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;

=== Southeast Asia ===
Interracial marriage in [[Southeast Asia]] dates back to the spread of [[Culture of India|Indian culture]], including [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], to the region. From the 1st century onwards, mostly male traders and merchants from the [[Indian subcontinent]] frequently intermarried with the local female populations in [[Cambodia]], [[Burma]], [[Champa]], [[central Thailand]], the [[Malay Peninsula]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Indonesia]]. Many [[Indianized kingdom]]s rose in Southeast Asia during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Streams of civilization" /&gt;

From the 9th century onwards, some male [[Arab]] traders from the [[Middle East]] settled in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and married local [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]], [[Indonesia]]n and [[Filipino people|Filipina]] female populations, which contributed to the spread of [[Islam in Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="Arab-Malays" /&gt; From the 14th to the 17th centuries, many [[China|Chinese]], [[History of India|Indian]] and Arab traders settled within the kingdoms of Maritime Southeast Asia and married within local female populations. This tradition continued among [[Spanish people|Spain]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] traders who also married within local populations.&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia" /&gt; In the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of [[Japanese people]] travelled to Southeast Asia and married with local women there.&lt;ref name=Leupp /&gt;

In the late 20th century in European males in Southeast Asia engaged in foreign mail order bribes for marriage. Tens of thousands of single women throng the beaches of Bali in Indonesia every year. For decades, young Balinese men have taken advantage of the louche and laid-back atmosphere to find love and lucre from female tourists—Japanese, European and Australian for the most part—who by all accounts seem perfectly happy with the arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2440&amp;Itemid=202 Bali Beach Gigolos Under Fire].

Much of the business conducted with foreign men in southeast Asia was done by the local women, who served engaged in both sexual and mercantile intercourse with foreign male traders. A Portuguese- and Malay-speaking Vietnamese woman who lived in Macao for an extensive period of time was the person who interpreted for the first diplomatic meeting between Cochin-China and a Dutch delegation. She served as an interpreter for three decades in the Cochin-China court with an old woman who had been married to three husbands, one Vietnamese and two Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reid |first=Anthony |date=1990 |title=Southeast Asia in the Age of Commerce, 1450–1680: The lands below the winds |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lqyJViWXkVsC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=vietnamese+woman+portuguese+macau+cochin+china+spoke |location= |publisher=Yale University Press |edition=illustrated, reprint, revised |volume=Volume 1 of Southeast Asia in the Age of Commerce, 1450–1680 |page=165 |isbn=0-300-04750-9 |accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=MacLeod |editor1-first=Murdo J. | editor2-last=Rawski  |editor2-first= Evelyn Sakakida |date=1998 |title=European Intruders and Changes in Behaviour and Customs in Africa, America, and Asia Before 1800 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-CmAAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=636+ANTHONY+REID+excellent+Portuguese+and+Malay+and+had+long+resided+in+Macao.+She,+along+with+another+elderly+woman+who+had+had+two+Portuguese+husbands+as+well+as+one+Vietnamese,+had+been+the+principal+translator+for+the+Cochin-China+court+for+30+years+(Wonderaer,+1602:+22,+38).+Similarly+...+She+was+'a+prodigy+of+learning',+spoke+Chinese,+Thai,+Chuliah,+Bengali+and+Acehnese+and+knew+the+politics+of+all+the+Sumatran+coastal+states+intimately+(Anderson,+1826:+44-5).&amp;dq=636+ANTHONY+REID+excellent+Portuguese+and+Malay+and+had+long+resided+in+Macao.+She,+along+with+another+elderly+woman+who+had+had+two+Portuguese+husbands+as+well+as+one+Vietnamese,+had+been+the+principal+translator+for+the+Cochin-China+court+for+30+years+(Wonderaer,+1602:+22,+38).+Similarly+...+She+was+'a+prodigy+of+learning',+spoke+Chinese,+Thai,+Chuliah,+Bengali+and+Acehnese+and+knew+the+politics+of+all+the+Sumatran+coastal+states+intimately+(Anderson,+1826:+44-5). |location= |publisher=Ashgate |edition=illustrated, reprint |volume=Volume 30 of An Expanding World, the European Impact on World History, 1450–1800, Vol 30 |issue=Issue 30 of An expanding world |page=636 |isbn=0-86078-522-X |accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Hughes |editor1-first=Sarah S. |editor2-last=Hughes |editor2-first=Brady |date=1995 |title=Women in World History: Readings from prehistory to 1500 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=05WyAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Thus+the+first+Dutch+mission+to+Cochin-China+found+that+the+king+dealt+with+them+through+a+Vietnamese+woman+who+spoke+excellent+Portuguese+and+Malay+and+had+long+resided+in+Macao.+She,+along++with+another+elderly+woman+who+had+had+two+Portuguese+husbands+as+well+as+one+Vietnamese,+had+been+the+principal+translator+for+the+Cochin-China+court+for+thirty+years.&amp;dq=Thus+the+first+Dutch+mission+to+Cochin-China+found+that+the+king+dealt+with+them+through+a+Vietnamese+woman+who+spoke+excellent+Portuguese+and+Malay+and+had+long+resided+in+Macao.+She,+along++with+another+elderly+woman+who+had+had+two+Portuguese+husbands+as+well+as+one+Vietnamese,+had+been+the+principal+translator+for+the+Cochin-China+court+for+thirty+years. |location= |publisher=M.E.

This is a custom used by several nations in the East Indies, as at Pegu, Siam, Cochin-China, and Cambodia, as I have been told. It is used at Tunquin also to my knowledge; for I did afterwards make a voyage thither, and most of our men had women on board all the time of our abode there. In Africa, also, on the coast of Guinea, our merchants, factors, and seamen that reside there, have their black misses. It is accounted a piece of policy to do it; for the chief factors and captains of ships have the great men's daughters offered them, the mandarins' or noblemen's at Tunquin, and even the King's wives in Guinea; and by this sort of alliance the country people are engaged to a greater friendship; and if there should arise any difference about trade, or any thing else, which might provoke the native to seek some treacherous revenge, to which all these heathen nations are very prone, then these Dalilahs would certainly declare it to their white friends, and so hinder their countrymen's design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinkerton |first=John |date=1819 |title=A General Collection of the Best and Most Interesting Voyages and Travels in Various Parts of America, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KVG-d40WYesC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=It+is+accounted+a+piece+of+Policy+to+do+it;+for+the+chief+Factors+and+Captains+of+Ships+have+the+great+men%27s+Daughters+offered+them,+the+Mandarins+or+Noblemen+at+Tunquin |location= |publisher=Longman, Hurst, Rees and Orme and Brown |page=41 |isbn= |accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peletz |first=Michael G. |date=2009 |title=Gender Pluralism: Southeast Asia Since Early Modern Times |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HGOTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=Siam,+Cochinchina,+and+Cambodia.+I+did+afterwards+make+a+Voyage+and+most+of+our+Men+had+Women+aboard+all+the+time+of+our+abode+there |location= |publisher=Routledge |page=89 |isbn=1-135-95489-5 |accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dampier |first=William |editor-last=Masefield |editor-first= John |date=1906 |title=Dampier's voyages: consisting of a New voyage round the world, a Supplement to the Voyage round the world, Two voyages to Campeachy, a Discourse of winds, a Voyage to New Holland, and a Vindication, in answer to the Chimerical relation of William Funnell, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=V9gZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA393&amp;dq=Siam,+Cochinchina,+and+Cambodia.+I+did+afterwards+make+a+Voyage+and+most+of+our+Men+had+Women+aboard+all+the+time+of+our+abode+there |location= |publisher=E.

Alexander Hamilton said, "The Tonquiners used to be very desirous of having a brood of Europeans in their country, for which reason the greatest nobles thought it no shame or disgrace to marry their daughters to English and Dutch seamen, for the time they were to stay in Tonquin, and often presented their sons-in-law pretty handsomely at their departure, especially if they left their wives with child; but adultery was dangerous to the husband, for they are well versed in the art of poisoning."&lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="viet-dragon.blogspot.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinkerton |first=John |date=1819 |title=A General Collection of the Best and Most Interesting Voyages and Travels in Various Parts of Asia: Many of which are Now First Translated Into English : Digested on a New Plan ; Illustr. with Plates, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AlNBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA484&amp;dq=thought+it+no+Shame+or+Disgrace+to+marry+their+daughters+to+English+and+Dutch+Seamen,+for+the+they+were+to+stay+in+,+and+often+presented+their+Son+in+Law+pretty+handsomely |location= |publisher=Longman |page=484 |isbn= |accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Pinkerton |editor-first= John |date=1811 |title=A general collection of … voyages and travels, digested by J.

==== Burma ====
[[Islam in Burma|Burmese Muslims]] are the descendants of [[Islam in India|Indian Muslims]], [[Arabs]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Pashtun people|Pathans]], [[Islam in China|Chinese Muslims]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] who settled and intermarried with the local [[Bamar|Burmese]] population and other [[List of ethnic groups in Burma|Burmese ethnic groups]] such as the [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Karen people|Karen]], and [[Mon people|Mon]].&lt;ref name="Muslims of Burma" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lay1973" /&gt;

During [[British India]]n rule, millions of [[Burmese Indians|Indians]], mostly Muslim, migrated there. The small population of mixed descendants of Indian men and local Burmese women are called "Zerbadees", often in a pejorative sense implying mixed race. The [[Rohingya]] claim to have descended from [[Bengali people|Bengalis]] who intermarried with the local women, but this remains a hotly contested issue. The political situation surrounding the actual history of the Rohingya, the lack of evidence, and the counter-claims, mean that proper ancestry cannot be established. The [[Panthays]], a group of [[Islam in China|Chinese Muslims]] descended from [[West Asia]]ns and [[Central Asia]]ns, migrated from China and also intermarried with local Burmese females.&lt;ref name="Muslim Communities in Myanmar" /&gt;

Burma has an estimated 52,000 [[Anglo-Burmese people]], descended from [[British people|British]] and Burmese people. Anglo-Burmese people frequently intermarried with [[Anglo-Indian]] immigrants, who assimilated into the Anglo-Burmese community.

==== Malaysia and Singapore ====
In [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], the majority of inter-ethnic marriages are between [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Indians]]. The offspring of such marriages are informally known as "[[Chindian]]". The Malaysian and Singaporean governments, however, only classify them by their father's ethnicity. As the majority of these marriages involve an Indian groom and Chinese bride, the majority of Chindians in Malaysia are usually classified as "[[Malaysian Indian|Indian]]" by the Malaysian government. As for the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], who are predominantly [[Muslim]], legal restrictions in Malaysia make it less common for them to intermarry with either the Indians, who are predominantly [[Hindu]], or the Chinese, who are predominantly [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Taoism|Taoist]].&lt;ref name="Building Cultural Nationalism in Malaysia" /&gt;

It is common for [[Arab Singaporean|Arabs in Singapore]] and Malaysia to take local Malay wives, due to a common [[Islam]]ic faith.&lt;ref name=Arab-Malays /&gt; The [[Chitty]] people, in Singapore and the [[Malacca]] state of Malaysia, are a [[Tamil people]] with considerable Malay descent, which was due to thousands of the first Tamil settlers taking local wives, since they did not bring along any of their own women with them. According to government statistics, the population of Singapore as of September 2007 was 4.68&amp;nbsp;million, of whom multiracial people, including [[Chindian]]s and [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]], formed 2.4%. In 2007, 16.4% of all marriages in Singapore were inter-ethnic.&lt;ref name="Go ahead, call me Chindian" /&gt; The [[Peranakan]]s are descendants of Chinese merchants who settled down in Malaysia and Singapore during the colonial era and married Malay women. There is also a significant minority population of [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]] who are descended from Europeans – Singapore and Malaysia being former British colonies – and local women.

==== Philippines ====
[[File:Mixed-couple.jpg|thumb|A Filipina bride and Nigerian groom walk down the aisle.]]
Centuries of [[Human migration|migration]], [[diaspora]], [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], and [[cultural diversity]] have made most Filipinos open-minded in embracing interracial marriage and [[multiculturalism]]. Following independence, the Philippines has seen both small and large-scale immigration into the country, mostly involving Chinese, Americans, [[Europe]]ans, [[Japanese people|Japanese]], and [[Desi|South Asians]]. More recent migrations into the country by [[Koreans]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Brazilians]] and other [[Southeast Asia]]ns have contributed to the enrichment of the country's ethnic landscape.

Thousands of interracial marriages between Americans and Filipinos have taken place since the [[United States]] took possession of the Philippines after the [[Philippine–American War]]. Due to the strategic location of the Philippines, as many as 21 bases and 100,000 military personnel were stationed there since the U.S. first colonized the islands in 1898. These bases were decommissioned in 1992 after the end of the [[Cold War]], but left behind thousands of [[Amerasian]] children. The Pearl S. Buck International foundation estimates there are 52,000 Amerasians scattered throughout the Philippines.

In the United States intermarriage among Filipinos with other races is common. They have the largest number of interracial marriages among Asian immigrant groups, as documented in California.&lt;ref name="Interracial Dating &amp; Marriage" /&gt; It is also noted that 21.8% of Filipino Americans are of mixed blood, second among Asian Americans, and is the fastest growing.&lt;ref name="asian-nation" /&gt;

Interracial marriages particularly among Southeast Asians are continually increasing. At present, there is an increasing number of Southeast Asian intermarriages, particularly between Filipinos and Malaysians (Dumanig, 2009). Such marriages have created an impact on language, religion and culture. Dumanig argues that Filipino-Malaysian couples no longer prefer their own ethnic languages as the medium of communication at home. The use of English with some switching in Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese, and Filipino is commonly used.&lt;ref name="eastwestcenter" /&gt;

[[Philippine nationality law]] is currently based upon the principles of jus sanguinis and therefore descent from a parent who is a citizen/national of the Republic of the Philippines is the primary method of acquiring Philippine citizenship. Birth in the Philippines to foreign parents does not in itself confer Philippine citizenship, although RA9139, the Administrative Naturalization Law of 2000, does provide a path for administrative naturalization of certain aliens born on Philippine soil (Jus soli). Together, some of these recent immigrants have intermarried with the indigenous Filipinos, as well as with the previous immigrant groups, giving rise to Filipinos of mixed racial and/or ethnic origins also known as [[Filipino mestizo|mestizos]].

=== South Asia ===
[[File:Khair-un-Nissa.jpg|thumb|An oil painting of Khair-un-Nissa by [[George Chinnery]]. c. 1805. She was an Indian Hyderabadi noblewoman who married British Lieutenant Colonel [[James Achilles Kirkpatrick]].]]
[[File:Rahulgandhi.jpg|thumb|[[Rahul Gandhi]], a member of the Indian Parliament, is the son of an Indian father ([[Rajiv Gandhi]]) and Italian mother ([[Sonia Gandhi]]).]]

The Indian subcontinent has a long history of inter-ethnic marriage dating back to ancient history. Various groups of people have been intermarrying for millennia in South Asia, including speakers of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] (Indic), [[Iranian languages|Iranian]], [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]], and [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] languages. This was particularly common in the northwestern and northeastern parts of the subcontinent where invaders of Central Asian origin often invaded throughout history.

Many Indian traders, merchants and missionaries travelled to [[Southeast Asia]] (where [[Indianized kingdom]]s were established) and often took local wives from the region. The [[Romani people]] ("[[Romani people|Gypsies]]") who have origins in the Indian subcontinent travelled westwards and also took local wives in [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Europe]]. Genetic studies show that the majority of Romani males carry large frequencies of particular [[Y chromosome]]s (inherited paternally) that otherwise exist only in populations from [[South Asia]], in addition to nearly a third of Romani females carrying particular [[mitochondrial DNA]] (inherited maternally) that is rare outside South Asia.&lt;ref name="kalaydjieva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="David Gresham" /&gt; Around  800, a ship carrying [[Persian Jews]] crashed in India. They settled in different parts of India and befriended and traded with the local Indian population. Intermarriage occurred, and to this day the [[History of the Jews in India|Indian Jews]] physically resemble their surrounding Indian populations due to intermarriage.

There are also cases of Indian princesses marrying kings abroad. For example, the [[Korean language|Korean]] text Samguk Yusa about the Gaya kingdom (it was absorbed by the kingdom of [[Silla]] later), indicate that in 48&amp;nbsp;AD, King Kim Suro of Gaya (the progenitor of the Gimhae Kim clan) took Princess Heo from "Ayuta" (the Korean name for the city of [[Ayodhya]] in North India) as his bride and queen. According to the Samguk Yusa, the princess' parents had a dream sent by a god who told them about a king from a faraway land. That was King Kim Suro of the Gaya kingdom, in what is now the southeastern tip of [[South Korea]].

In [[Goa]] during the late 16th and 17th centuries, there was a community of [[Slavery in Japan|Japanese slaves]] and traders, who were either [[Christianity in Japan|Japanese Christians]] fleeing anti-Christian sentiments in Japan,&lt;ref name=Leupp-52 /&gt; or [[Japanese people|Japanese]] slaves brought or captured by [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] traders and their South Asian ''[[lascar]]'' crewmembers from Japan.&lt;ref name=Leupp-49 /&gt; In both cases, they often intermarried with the local population in Goa.&lt;ref name=Leupp-52 /&gt; One offspring of such an intermarriage was [[Maria Guyomar de Pinha]], born in [[Thailand]] to a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]-speaking Japanese-[[Bengali people|Bengali]] father from Goa and a Japanese mother.&lt;ref name="google5" /&gt; In turn, she married the [[Greek people|Greek]] adventurer [[Constantine Phaulkon]].&lt;ref name="google6" /&gt;

Inter-ethnic marriages between European men and Indian women were very common during colonial times. According to the historian William Dalrymple, about one in three European men (mostly [[British people|British]], as well as [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[French people|French]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], and to a lesser extent [[Swedes]] and [[Danes]]) had Indian wives in colonial India. One of the most famous intermarriages was between the [[Anglo-Indians|Anglo-Indian]] resident [[James Achilles Kirkpatrick]] and the [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabadi]] noblewoman and descendant of prophet Mohammed, Khair-un-Nissa. During the British [[East India Company]]'s [[Company rule in India|rule in India]] in the late 18th century and early 19th century, it was initially fairly common for British officers and soldiers to take local Indian wives. The 600,000 strong [[Anglo-Indian]] community has descended from such unions. There is also a story of an attractive Gujjar princess falling in love with a handsome English nobleman and the nobleman converted to Islam so as to marry her. The 65,000 strong [[Burgher people|Burgher]] community of [[Sri Lanka]] was formed by the intermarriages of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] men with local [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] and [[Tamil people|Tamil]] women. Intermarriage also took place in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the 17th to 19th centuries, when the British East India Company brought over many thousands of [[British Indian|Indian]] scholars, ''[[lascar]]s'' and workers. (mostly [[British Bangladeshi|Bengali]]) Most of whom worked on British ships in transient around the world. A small number of which settled down in Britain and took local British wives, as well as a limited number going  with their husbands.&lt;ref name="Counterflows to Colonialism: Indian Traveller and Settler in Britain 1600-1857" /&gt; In the mid-19th century, there were around 40,000 British soldiers but less than 2,000 British officials present in India.&lt;ref name=Fisher-2007 /&gt; The novel "Two Leaves and a Bud" by Ananda depicts Indian laborer women in India being preyed upon and seduced by the British Manager Reggie Hunt after he gives them bangles and nose rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=59, 65, 68 |year=2002 |accessdate=1 June 2006 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist |volume= |issn= |edition= |author1=N.

In [[Assam]], local Indian women married several waves of Chinese migrants during British colonial times, to the point where it became hard to physically differentiate Chinese in Assam from locals during the time of their [[Persecution of Chinese Indians|internment during the 1962 war]], and the majority of these Chinese in Assam were married to Indian women, and some of these Indian women were deported to China with their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chowdhury |first=RITA |date=18 November 2012 |title=The Assamese Chinese story |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-assamese-chinese-story/article4106422.ece |newspaper=The Hindu |location= |publisher= |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Das |first=Gaurav |date=22 Oct 2013 &lt;!-- 01.19AM IST --&gt; |title=Tracing roots from Hong Kong to Assam |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Tracing-roots-from-Hong-Kong-to-Assam/articleshow/24502700.cms |newspaper=The Times of India |location= |publisher= |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=editor |date=8 December 2010 &lt;!-- 10:00 pm --&gt; |title=CHINESE-ASSAMESE: How To Stay Silent In Chinese |url=http://manipuronline.com/culture-society/northeast-chinese-assamese-how-to-stay-silent-in-chinese/2010/12/08 |newspaper=Manipur Online |location= |publisher= |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=MITRA |first=DOLA |date=29 Nov 2010 |title=How To Stay Silent In Chinese |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/how-to-stay-silent-in-chinese/268044 |newspaper=Outlook |location= |publisher= |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sharma |first=Anup |date=22 October 2013 |title=HOMECOMING: CHINESE TO REVISIT BIRTHPLACE IN ASSAM |url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/todays-newspaper/homecoming-chinese-to-revisit-birthplace-in-assam.html |newspaper=the pioneer |location=Guwahati |publisher= |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=18 April 2010 |title=HOMECOMING: CHINESE TO REVISIT BIRTHPLACE IN ASSAM |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100418/jsp/7days/story_12351075.jsp |newspaper=The Telegraph, calcutta, india |location= |publisher= |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=&lt;!-- Updated: Sunday,--&gt; 17 May 2015&lt;!-- , 15:28 [IST] --&gt; |title=Assamese of Chinese origin facing severe identity crisis |url=http://www.oneindia.com/india/assamese-of-chinese-origin-facing-severe-identity-crisis-1749661.html |newspaper=oneindia |location= |publisher= |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bora |first=Bijay Sankar |date=25 May 2015&lt;!-- 1:38AM--&gt; |title=Taunted as spies, China war victims seethe silently |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/taunted-as-spies-china-war-victims-seethe-silently/85123.html |newspaper=The Tribune |location=Guwahati |publisher= |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=TALUKDAR |first=Sushanta |date=8 November 2010 |title=Assamese of Chinese origin can visit State: Gogoi |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/article872991.ece |newspaper=The Hindu |location=GUWAHATI |publisher= |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhapa.com/sino-indian-war-1962-makum/ |title=Sino-Indian war in 1962 – Bitter Memories |author=leon |date=2010-04-29 |website=Dhapa |publisher=|access-date= |quote=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, when the British [[Straits Settlement]] shipped Chinese convicts to be jailed in India, the Chinese men then settled in the [[Nilgiri mountains]] near [[Naduvattam]] after their release and married [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Paraiyan]] women, having mixed Chinese-Tamil children with them.

Edgar Thurston described the colony of the Chinese men with their Tamil pariah wives and children: "Halting in the course of a recent anthropological expedition on the western side of the Nilgiri plateau, in the midst of the Government Cinchona plantations, I came across a small settlement of Chinese, who have squatted for some years on the slopes of the hills between Naduvatam and Gudalur, and developed, as the result of ' marriage ' with Tamil pariah women, into a colony, earning an honest livelihood by growing vegetables, cultivating coffee on a small scale, and adding to their income from these sources by the economic products of the cow. An ambassador was sent to this miniature Chinese Court with a suggestion that the men should, in return for monies, present themselves before me with a view to their measurements being recorded. The reply which came back was in its way racially characteristic as between Hindus and Chinese. In the case of the former, permission to make use of their bodies for the purposes of research depends essentially on a pecuniary transaction, on a scale varying from two to eight annas. The Chinese, on the other hand, though poor, sent a courteous message to the effect that they did not require payment in money, but would be perfectly happy if I would give them, as a memento, copies of their photographs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=31 |edition= |pages= |year=1897 |accessdate=2012-03-02 |publisher=Printed by the Superintendent, Govt.

The figures given in the table bring out very clearly the great breadth, as compared with the length of the heads of all the children, and the resultant high cephalic index. In other words, in one case a mesaticephalic (79), and, in the remaining three cases, a sub-brachycephalic head (80"1; 801 ; 82-4) has resulted from the union of a mesaticephalic Chinaman (78-5) with a sub-dolichocephalic Tamil Pariah (76"8). How great is the breadth of the head in the children may be emphasised by noting that the average head-breadth of the adult Tamil Pariah man is only 13"7 cm., whereas that of the three boys, aged ten, nine, and five only, was 14 3, 14, and 13"7 cm. respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quite as strongly marked is the effect of paternal influence on the character of the nose; the nasal index, in the case of each child (68"1 ; 717; 727; 68'3), bearing a much closer relation to that of the long nosed father (71'7) than to the typical Pariah nasal index of the broadnosed mother (78-7).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will be interesting to note, hereafter, what is the future of the younger members of this quaint little colony, and to observe the physical characters, temperament, improvement or deterioration, fecundity, and other points relating to the cross-breed resulting from the union of Chinese and Tamil. |location=MADRAS |title=Bulletin …, Volumes 2-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DvgSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA32 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=32 |edition= |pages= |year=2004 |accessdate=2012-03-02 |publisher=Asian Educational Services |volume=Volume 2, Issue 1 of Bulletin (Government Museum (Madras, India)) |author=Edgar Thurston |quote= |location= |title=Badagas and Irulas of Nilgiris, Paniyans of Malabar: A Cheruman Skull, Kuruba Or Kurumba – Summary of Results |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ca6wmDzhMDoC&amp;pg=PA32 |isbn=81-206-1857-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=99 |edition=illustrated |pages= |year=1987 |accessdate=2012-03-02 |publisher=Asian Educational Services |volume= |author1=Edgar Thurston |author2=K.

== Europe ==

=== Balkans ===

[[Vikings]] explored and eventually settled in territories in [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]-dominated areas of [[Europe]]. By 950&amp;nbsp;AD, these settlements were largely Slavicized through intermarriage with the local population. Europe, especially the Balkans, was an important source of captives for the [[Arab slave trade]] then, and ''[[Saqaliba]]'' (Slavic) slaves taken to the [[Arab World]] often intermarried or had unions with their [[Arab]] owners.

=== France ===
The French [[Normans]] were descended from [[Danish people|Danish]] [[Vikings]] who were given feudal overlordship of areas in northern [[France]]—the [[Duchy of Normandy]]—in the 8th century. In that respect, descendants of the Vikings in [[France]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] continued to have an influence in [[northern Europe]] as well. Likewise, King [[Harold Godwinson]], the last [[Anglo-Saxon]] king of [[England]] who was killed during the Norman invasion in 1066, had Danish ancestors. Many of the medieval kings of [[Norway]] and Denmark married into English and [[Scotland|Scottish]] royalty and occasionally got involved in dynastic disputes.

During [[World War I]], there were 135,000 soldiers from [[British India]],&lt;ref name="Enloe" /&gt; a large number of soldiers from French [[North Africa]],&lt;ref name="Race, Sex, and War" /&gt; and 20,000 labourers from [[South Africa]],&lt;ref name="Battle Colors: Race, Sex, and Colonial Soldiery in World War I" /&gt; who served in [[France]]. Much of the [[French people|French]] male population had gone to war, leaving behind a surplus of French females,&lt;ref name="Race, Sex, and War" /&gt; many of whom formed interracial relationships with non-white soldiers, mainly [[Indian Army (1858–1947)|Indian]]&lt;ref name="Personal Perspectives: World War I" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Omissi" /&gt; and North African.&lt;ref name=Enloe /&gt; British and French authorities allowed foreign [[Muslim]] soldiers to intermarry with local French females on the basis of [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which allows marriage between Muslim men and [[Christian]] women. On the other hand, [[Hindu]] soldiers in France were restricted from intermarriage on the basis of the [[Caste system in India|Indian caste system]].&lt;ref name=Omissi /&gt;

According to [[France]]'s 1999 Census, 38% and 34% of male and female married immigrants, respectively, are intermarried. The highest intermarriage rate was for European immigrants, mainly [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[Italian people|Italian]], nearly 50% of whom have had intermarriages. 30% of [[North Africa]]n immigrants and 20% of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] immigrants have also had intermarriages. The lowest intermarriage rate was for [[Turkish people|Turkish]] immigrants, with 14% for married males and 4% for married females.&lt;ref name="Intermarriage, Language, and Economic Assimilation Process: A Case Study of France" /&gt;

=== Germany ===
The administrations of the [[German colonies]] in Africa and the South Seas enacted bans on marriages with non-European natives in the early 20th century. When the issue was debated in the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] in 1912, this ban was rejected by a majority and an inclusive marriage law was demanded (see [[German interracial marriage debate (1912)]]). However, it never came to pass because of the beginning of [[World War I]] a few years later. 

Nazi Germany introduced the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935, among which was the ''Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour'' that banned marital as well as extramarital relations between Germans (incl. people deemed to be racially similar, colloquially ''Aryans'') and Jews. Although Slavs could be in theory included as ''Aryans'',&lt;ref&gt;The term 'Arier', i.e. 'Aryan', was never used in important legal documents. Instead, one usually encounters the term 'artverwandtes Blut', i.e. roughly 'kindred blood' or 'blood of related stock', which includes in theory all native Europeans except for Jews and Gypsies. H. H. Schubert (1941): Eine Klarstellung zum Begriff 'artverwandtes Blut' [A clarification of the term 'kindred blood']. In: Volk und Rasse 12, pp. 216-218.&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi Germany's legal practice consisted in strict segregation of Germans and most subjugated Slavs and harsh punishment for miscegenation, as exemplified by the [[Polish decrees]] of 1940.

According to the 2006 figures from [[Germany]]'s Federal Statistics Office, [[Turkish people|Turkish]] men accounted for 14% of foreigners married to German women, followed by [[Italian people|Italians]] and [[United States|US Americans]].&lt;ref name="IS" /&gt; Conversely, German men marrying non-German women primarily choose [[Poles|Polish]], [[Russians|Russian]], [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]] or [[Thai people|Thai]] women following in roughly equal numbers.&lt;ref name="IS" /&gt;

[[Comparative sociology|Comparative sociologist]] Amparo Gonzalez-Ferrer argues that one of the main reasons why Turkish men marry Germans more than Turkish women do is due to [[Islam]] permitting men but not women to marry non-Muslims.&lt;ref name="IS" /&gt; Dirk Halm, [[political scientist]] for the Center for Turkish Studies in [[Essen]], remarked that considering Turkish citizens make up 25% of all foreign residents in Germany—not counting an additional one-third ethnic Turks who are German citizens—intermarriage rates in Germany are "in reality very low".&lt;ref name="IS" /&gt;

=== Iberian Peninsula ===
[[File:Maler der Geschichte von Bayâd und Riyâd 002.jpg|thumb|''[[Hadith Bayad wa Riyad]]'' (12th century) was an [[Arabic literature|Arabic love story]] about an [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] female and a foreign [[Damascus|Damascene]] male.]]
In [[ancient history]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was frequently invaded by foreigners who intermarried with the native population. One of the earliest foreign groups to arrive to the region were the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Celts]] who intermarried with the [[Old European culture|pre-Indo-European]] [[Iberians]] in [[prehistoric Iberia]]. They were later followed by the [[Phoenicia]]n [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] and Indo-European [[Roman conquest of Hispania|Romans]] who intermarried with the [[pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula]] during [[Classical Antiquity]]. They were in turn followed by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Visigoths]], [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]] and the [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] [[Alans]] who also intermarried with the local population in [[Hispania]] during [[late Antiquity]]. In the 6th century, the region was reconquered by the [[Byzantine Empire]] (Eastern [[Roman Empire]]) before it was lost again to the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] less than a century later.

After the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] in the early 8th century, the [[Islamic state]] of [[Al-Andalus]] was established in Iberia. Due to [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|Islamic marital law]] allowing a [[Muslim]] male to marry [[Christian]] and [[Jew]]ish females, it became common for [[Arab]] and [[Berber people|Berber]] males from [[North Africa]] to intermarry with the local Germanic, [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and Iberian females of Hispania.&lt;ref name="uca" /&gt;&lt;ref name="transaction" /&gt; The offspring of such marriages were known as ''[[Muladi]]'' or ''Muwallad'', an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term still used in the modern [[Arab world]] to refer to people with Arab fathers and [[Ajam|non-Arab]] mothers.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; This term was also the origin for the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''[[Mulatto]]''.&lt;ref name="La esclavitud en Huelva y Palos (1570–1587)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt; In addition, many ''Muladi'' were also descended from ''[[Saqaliba]]'' ([[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]) slaves taken from [[Europe]] via the [[Arab slave trade]]. By the 11th or 12th century, the Muslim population of Al-Andalus had merged into a homogeneous group of people known as the "[[Moors]]". After the [[Reconquista]], which was completed in 1492, most of the Moors were forced to either flee to [[Morocco]] or [[Conversion to Christianity|convert to Christianity]]. The ones who converted to Christianity were known as [[Morisco]]es, and they were often persecuted by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] on the basis of the ''[[Limpieza de sangre]]'' ("Cleanliness of blood") or "[[Nobility#"Blue" blood|blue blood]]" doctrine.&lt;ref name="aristocrats" /&gt;

==== Portuguese colonies ====
{{See also|Orfas del Rei}}
According to [[Gilberto Freyre]], a Brazilian sociologist, miscegenation was commonplace in the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonies]], and was even supported by the court as a way to boost low populations and guarantee a successful and cohesive settlement. Thus, settlers often released [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] to become their wives. The children were guaranteed full [[Portuguese citizenship]], provided the parents were married. Some former Portuguese colonies have large [[multiracial|mixed-race]] populations, for instance, [[Brazil]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Mozambique]], [[Timor Leste]], [[Macau]] and [[São Tomé and Príncipe]]. In the case of Brazil, the influential "Indianist" novels of [[José de Alencar]] ([[O Guarany]], [[Iracema]], and [[Ubirajara (novel)|Ubirajara]]) perhaps went farther than in the other colonies, advocating miscegenation in order to create a truly Brazilian race.&lt;ref&gt;Sá, Lúcia. Rain Forest Literatures: Amazonian Texts and Latin American Culture. Minneapolis, Minnesota: U of Minnesota Press, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-8166-4325-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed marriages between [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and locals in former [[colonies]] were very common in all Portuguese colonies. Miscegenation was still common in Africa until the independence of the former Portuguese colonies in the mid-1970s.

=== Iceland ===
Most [[Icelanders]] are descendants of [[Norway|Norwegian]] settlers and [[Celt]]s from [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]], brought over as slaves during [[settlement of Iceland|the age of settlement]]. Recent DNA analysis suggests that around 66% of the male settler-era population was of Norse ancestry, whereas the female population was 60% Celtic.&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11179019 |title=mtDNA and the Islands of the North Atlantic: Estimating the Proportions of Norse and Gaelic Ancestry |pmc=1274484 |year=2001 |last1=Helgason |first1=A |last2=Hickey |first2=E |last3=Goodacre |first3=S |last4=Bosnes |first4=V |last5=Stefánsson |first5=K |last6=Ward |first6=R |last7=Sykes |first7=B |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=723–37 |doi=10.1086/318785 |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10712214 |title=mtDNA and the Origin of the Icelanders: Deciphering Signals of Recent Population History |pmc=1288180 |year=2000 |last1=Helgason |first1=A |last2=Sigureth Ardóttir |first2=S |last3=Gulcher |first3=JR |last4=Ward |first4=R |last5=Stefánsson |first5=K |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=999–1016 |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |doi=10.1086/302816}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2000 |pmid=10931763 |title=Estimating Scandinavian and Gaelic Ancestry in the Male Settlers of Iceland |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=67 |pages=697–717 |doi=10.1086/303046 |last1=Ellrodt |first1=AG |last2=Conner |first2=L |last3=Riedinger |first3=MS |last4=Weingarten |first4=S |issue=12 |last5=Hill |first5=Emmeline W. |last6=Bradley |first6=Daniel G. |last7=Bosnes |first7=Vidar |last8=Gulcher |first8=Jeffery R. |last9=Ward |first9=Ryk|last10=Stefánsson|first10=Kári |pmc=1287529|display-authors=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="genomenewsnetwork"&gt;[http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/08_00/Icelanders.shtml ''Icelanders, a diverse bunch?''].

As was the case in other areas occupied by Muslims, it was acceptable in [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|Islamic marital law]] for a [[Muslim]] male to marry [[Christian]] and [[Jew]]ish females in southern Italy when under Islamic rule – namely, the [[Emirate of Sicily]], and, of least importance, the short-lived [[Emirate of Bari]] between the 8th and 11th centuries. In this case, most intermarriages were between [[Arab]] and [[Berber people|Berber]] males from North Africa and the local [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italian]] females. Such intermarriages were particularly common in the [[Emirate of Sicily]], where one writer visiting the place in the 970s expressed shock at how common it was in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Emma Blake |contribution=The Familiar Honeycomb: Byzantine Era Reuse of Sicily's Prehistoric Rock-Cut Tombs|editor-last=Ruth M.

Atti delle 4/e Giornate ... |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; later the remnants were expelled in 1239 with the persecution of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], who deported the Muslim survivors in [[Muslim settlement of Lucera|Lucera]].

In [[Malta]], Arabs and Italians from neighbouring Sicily and [[Calabria]] intermarried with the local inhabitants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofmalta.com/core/article.php?id=270452 Alex E. Felice, "Genetic origin of contemporary Maltese," ''The Sunday Times (of Malta)'', 5 August 2007], last visited 5 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; who were descended from [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[Vandals]]. The [[Maltese people]] are descended from such unions, and the [[Maltese language]] is descended from [[Siculo-Arabic]].

At times, the Italian city-states also played an active role in the [[Arab slave trade]], where Moorish and Italian traders occasionally exchanged slaves. For example, two researchers suggest that [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s mother Caterina may have been a slave from the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="Experts" /&gt;

=== Ottoman Empire ===
{{See also|Valide Sultan|Sultanate of women}}

In the 11th century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] territory of [[Anatolia]] was conquered by the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], who came from [[Turkestan]] in [[Central Asia]]. Their [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman Turkish]] descendants went on to annex the [[Balkans]] and southern parts of [[Central Europe]] in the 15th and 16th centuries. Due to [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|Islamic marital law]] allowing a [[Muslim]] male to marry [[Christian]] and [[Jew]]ish females, it was common in the [[Ottoman Empire]] for Turkish males to intermarry with European females. For example, various [[sultan]]s of the [[Ottoman Dynasty]] often had [[Greeks|Greek]] (''[[Rûm]]''), [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] (''[[Saqaliba]]''), [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]], [[North Caucasus|Northcaucasian]] and [[France|French]] wives. Some of these European wives exerted great influence upon the empire as ''[[Valide Sultan]]'' ("Sultan's Parent"); some famous examples included [[Roxelana]], a Slavic [[harem]] slave who later became [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]'s favourite wife, and [[Aimée du Buc de Rivéry]], wife of [[Abdul Hamid I]] and cousin of French Empress [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Josephine]]. Due to the common occurrence of such intermarriages in the Ottoman Empire, they had a significant impact on the ethnic makeup of the modern [[Turkish people|Turkish]] population in [[Turkey]], which now differs from that of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] population in Central Asia.&lt;ref name="The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922" /&gt;

The [[Imperial Harem|concubines of the Ottoman Sultan]] consisted chiefly of purchased slaves. Because Islamic law forbade Muslims to enslave fellow Muslims, the Sultan's concubines were generally of Christian origin. The mother of a Sultan, though technically a slave, received the extremely powerful title of ''Valide Sultan'', and at times became effective ruler of the Empire (see [[Sultanate of women]]). One notable example was [[Kösem Sultan]], daughter of a Greek Christian priest, who dominated the Ottoman Empire during the early decades of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="generally" /&gt;

Intermarriage with non-European populations began as early as the [[First agricultural revolution|Agricultural Revolution]]. Researchers have found that a majority of British males have DNA that can be traced back to [[Middle East]]ern male farmers (from around present-day [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]]) who around 10,000 years ago began migrating to Britain, introducing [[agriculture]] to the island, and settling down with local British females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1244654/Study-finds-Britons-descended-farmers-left-Iraq-Syria-10-000-years-ago.html |title=Study finds Britons are descended from farmers who left Iraq and Syria 10,000 years ago |work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Kingdom|Britain]] has a long history of [[interethnic marriage]] among the various [[Europe]]an populations that inhabited the island, including the [[Celts|Celtic]], [[Roman Britain|Roman]], [[Viking]], [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] peoples. In the late 15th century, the [[Romani people]] arrived. The arriving Romani nomads took local British wives, forming a distinct community known as the [[Romnichal]]. Due to intermarriage, Romnichal today are often indistinguishable from the general [[white British]] population.

Inter-ethnic marriage began occurring more often in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] since the 17th century, when the British [[East India Company]] began bringing over many [[British Indian|Indian]] scholars, ''[[lascar]]s, servants'' and workers. Though mixed marriages were not always accepted in British society, there were no legal restrictions against intermarriage at the time.&lt;ref name="Counterflows" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Working" /&gt; By the mid-19th century, there were more than 40,000 Indian seamen, diplomats, scholars, soldiers, officials, tourists, businessmen and students arriving(normally temporarily) to Britain.&lt;ref name="Fisher-2007" /&gt; By the late 19th century and early 20th century, there were around 70,000 South Asians working on British ships,&lt;ref name="The lascars' lot" /&gt; 51,616 of whom were ''lascar'' seamen working on British merchant ships for the Royal Navy when World War 1 began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=43G472v4KMUC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q=51%2C616&amp;f=false |title=The Infidel Within: Muslims in Britain Since 1800 |date= |website= |publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Infidel37" /&gt; Families with South Asian ''lascar'' fathers and [[White people|white]] mothers established small interracial families in Britain's dock areas  .&lt;ref name="Growing Up" /&gt; This led to a number of "[[British Mixed-Race|mixed race]]" children being born in the country. The small number of ethnic minority women in Britain were often outnumbered by "half-caste Indian" daughters born from white mothers and Indian fathers although mixed race families were still very unusual in Britain at this time.&lt;ref name="Gender and Class in Modern Europe" /&gt; In addition, a number of British officers who had Indian wives and [[Anglo-Indian]] children in [[British India]] often brought them over to Britain in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Counterflows to Colonialism: Indian Traveller and Settler in Britain 1600-185710" /&gt;

Following [[World War I]], there were significantly more females than males in Britain,&lt;ref name="Infidel93" /&gt; and there were increasing numbers of seamen from the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Arab World]], [[Far East]] and [[Caribbean]]. A number of the seamen  intermarried and cohabited with local British women, which raised increasing concerns from a minority over miscegenation and led to a handful of [[race riot]]s in at the time.&lt;ref name="White Women" /&gt; By [[World War II]], any form of intimate relationship between a white woman and non-white man was considered offensive by a few.&lt;ref name="Infidel93" /&gt; In 1932, the Indian National Congress survey of 'all Indians outside India' estimated that there were 7,128 Indians living in the United Kingdom, which included students, professionals such as doctors and Lascars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5pGCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT138&amp;ots=W6kqi3lQvV&amp;dq=british%2520indians%2520lascars&amp;pg=PT138#v=onepage&amp;q=estimated%2520that%2520before&amp;f=false |title=Ayahs, Lascars and Princes: The Story of Indians in Britain 1700-1947 |date= |website= |publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few concerns were voiced regarding white adolescent girls forming relationships with men of colour, including South Asian seamen in the 1920s,&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; Muslim immigrants in the 1920s to 1940s,&lt;ref name="Infidel93" /&gt; [[African American]] [[GI (military)|GIs]] during World War II, [[Maltese in the United Kingdom|Maltese]] and [[British Cypriots|Cypriot]] cafe owners in the 1940s to 1950s, Caribbean immigrants in the 1950s to 1960s, and South Asian immigrants in the 1960s although the continuing record of mixed marriages and the later acceptance of successful mixed-race offspring in public and cultural life suggests tolerance at the time was the norm.  But a recent ethnographic study&lt;ref&gt;A White Side of Black Britain (2011) by [[France Winddance Twine]] Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; argues that there are a number negative impacts despite the veneer of tolerance.

The first Chinese settlers were mainly Cantonese from [[Northern and southern China|south China]], with some also from [[Shanghai]]. The figures of Chinese for 1921 are 2,157 men and 262 women. Many Chinese men married British women while others remained single, possibly supporting a wife and family back home in China. During the [[second world war]] (1939–45) another wave of Chinese seamen from Shanghai and of Cantonese origin married British women. Records show that about some 300 of these men had married British women and supported families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacu.org/ukchinese.html UK Chinese]. Sacu.org (2006-01-23). Retrieved 22 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|UK 2001 census]], [[black British]] males were around 50% more likely than black females to marry outside their race. [[British Chinese]] women (30%) were twice as likely as their male counterparts (15%) to marry someone from a different ethnic group. In 2001, 2% of all marriages in the United Kingdom were inter-ethnic.&lt;ref name="Natstats" /&gt; In 2011 the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|Census]] showed that almost one in 10 people in Britain were either married or living with someone from a different ethnic group, with proportions ranging from 85% of mixed-race people to 4% of white people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10943807/Love-across-the-divide-interracial-relationships-growing-in-Britain.html |title=Love across the divide: interracial relationships growing in Britain |date=3 July 2014 |work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, an [[international incident]] was created when the British government took exception to the "difficult problem"&lt;ref name="innertemple" /&gt; of the marriage of [[Seretse Khama]] and [[Ruth Williams Khama|Ruth Williams]], whom he had met while studying law in London. The interracial marriage sparked a furore among both the tribal elders of the Bamangwato and the [[apartheid]] government of [[South Africa]]. The latter objected to the idea of an interracial couple ruling just across their northern border, and exerted pressure to have Khama removed from his chieftainship. Britain's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government, then heavily in debt from [[World War II]], could not afford to lose cheap South African gold and uranium supplies. They also feared South Africa might take direct action against Bechuanaland, Khama's homeland, through economic sanctions or a military incursion.&lt;ref name="protectorates" /&gt;&lt;ref name="innertemple14" /&gt;
The British government began a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] enquiry into Khama's fitness for the chieftainship. Though the investigation reported that he was eminently fit for the rule of Bechuanaland, "but for his unfortunate marriage",&lt;ref name="innertemple15" /&gt; the government ordered the report suppressed. (It would remain so for thirty years.) It exiled Khama and his wife from Bechuanaland in 1951. It was many years before the couple was allowed to live in Africa, and several more years before Khama became president of what is now [[Botswana]]. Their son [[Ian Khama]] served as the president of that country decades later.

According to the 2011 census, people who were cohabiting were more likely to be in an inter-ethnic relationship, than people who were married or in a civil partnership (12% vs 8%). This was the case for all ethnic groups except [[Other White]], where the proportions were the same (39%). The pattern for inter-ethnic relationships for those married or in a civil partnership and those who were cohabiting was similar to the overall picture of inter-ethnic relationships across the ethnic groups – with the Mixed/Multiple ethnic groups as the most likely and White British the least likely. The largest differences between people who were married and cohabiting were in the Asian ethnic groups. Bangladeshis who were cohabiting were nearly seven times more likely to be in an inter-ethnic relationship than Bangladeshis who were married or in a civil partnership (39% compared with 6%). Indians (56% compared with 10%) and Pakistanis (41% compared with 8%) were around five times more likely. Two thirds (65%) of Other Asians cohabiting were in an inter-ethnic relationship compared with 28% who were married (or in civil partnership). In the Other ethnic groups, nearly three quarters of Arabs (72%) and Any Other ethnic groups (74%) cohabiting were in inter ethnic relationships, compared with almost a third (31%) of Arabs and over a third (37%) of Any Other ethnic group who were married (or in a civil partnership). The proportion of people in inter-ethnic relationships was lower in 2001, compared to 2011. Some 6% of people who were married in 2001 were in an inter-ethnic relationship compared to 10% who were cohabiting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://http//www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/what-does-the-2011-census-tell-us-about-inter-ethnic-relationships/sty-relationships.html]{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Complications ==
Oftentimes, couples in intercultural marriages face barriers that most married couples of the same culture are not exposed to. Intercultural marriages are often influenced by external factors that can create dissonance and disagreement in relationships.&lt;ref name="McFadden, J. 2001" /&gt; Different cultures endure vastly diverse [[moral]], [[ethical]] and [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]] foundations that influence their perceptions of individual, [[family]] and [[society|societal]] lifestyle. When these foundations are operating alongside the foundation of different cultural roots, as in intercultural marriages, problems and disagreement oftentimes occur. Interracial relationships can also be affected by immigrations problems, passport and citizen issues if they are residing abroad with their partner &lt;ref name="McFadden, J. 2001" /&gt; However, interracial marriages are not always intercultural marriages, as in some countries, such as the United States, people of different races can share the same cultural background and society.

According to studies by Jenifer L. Bratter and Rosalind B. King made publicly available on the [[Education Resources Information Center]], unions between White males and non-White females (and between Hispanics and non-Hispanic persons) have similar or lower risks of [[divorce]] than White-White marriages, unions between white male-black female last longer than white-white pairings or white-Asian pairings.&lt;ref name="ERIC"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bratter | first1 = J. L. | last2 = King | first2 = R. B. | doi = 10.1111/j.1741-3729.2008.00491.x | title = "But Will It Last?": Marital Instability Among Interracial and Same-Race Couples | journal = Family Relations | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 160–171 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, White female-Black male and White female-Asian male marriages are more prone to divorce than White-White pairings.&lt;ref name="ERIC" /&gt;

=== Family and society ===
The most common external factors influencing [[intercultural]] relationships and marriages are the acceptance of the family and the society in which the couple lives.&lt;ref name="McFadden, J. 2001" /&gt; Sometimes, the families of the partners display rejection, resistance, hostility and lack of acceptance for their kin's partner.&lt;ref name="McFadden, J. 2001" /&gt; Specific issues regarding the [[family]]; including generational gaps in [[ideology]], and how the [[wedding]] will be held; which ties into how [[tradition]] will or will not be practiced. Many intercultural couples report conflict arising over issues of how to carry out child raising and religious worship as well. Dealing with [[racism]] from outside sources is also a common area of potential conflict.

=== Communication style ===
Intercultural couples may possess differing [[communication]] styles. Individuals from a [[high context culture]] are not verbally explicit in their communication behaviors.&lt;ref name="highlow" /&gt; These cultures typically consist of [[eastern world]] countries where [[collectivism]] and relational harmony underlie communication behavior. By contrast, individuals from a [[low context culture]] use direct obvious communication styles to convey information.&lt;ref name="highlow" /&gt; In situations where marriage occurs between two people from differing communication contextual backgrounds, conflict may arise from relational challenges posed by the underlying assumptions of high/low context cultures. Challenges posed by differing communication styles are common among intercultural marriage couples.&lt;ref name="interracialcoup" /&gt; The longer the two individuals have existed in the current culture the less likely this is to pose an issue. If one or more partners within the [[marriage]] is relatively new to the dominant culture the likelihood for conflict to unfold on these bases increases.&lt;ref name="interracialcoup" /&gt;

=== Management ===
Intercultural couples tend to face hardships most within-culture relationships do not.&lt;ref&gt;A White Side of Black Britain: Interracial Intimacy and Racial Literacy, in Ethnic and Racial Studies, (a special issue on racial hierarchy) vol. 27, no. 6 (November, 2004): 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Various resources which focus on [[conflict resolution]] of intercultural differences in marriage relationships have become available in the [[Advertising|media]]. [[Relationship counseling|Specialized counseling]] and [[support groups]] have also become available to these couples. Conflict resolution and mediation of the infrastructural issues faced by intercultural couples leads to a broader understanding of culture and communication.&lt;ref name="intercultural" /&gt;  The concept of [[racial literacy]] was developed by sociologist [[France Winddance Twine]] to describe the ways in which these families teach their children about race and its impact.

== Benefits ==
It has been claimed by a number of scholars that diversity within a family system "enhances open communication for individuals to cultivate so they can have greater depth, and views of people within our world".&lt;ref name="Thompson  J, Collier M" /&gt;

It has also been claimed that the offspring of interracial marriages have a number of health and well being advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is It Better to Be Mixed Race? |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/is-it-better-to-be-mixed-race/ |website=Channel 4 |accessdate=2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Last but not leastWhy are mixed-race people perceived as more attractive? |url=http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p6626&amp; |journal=Perception |date=2010-01-01 |pages=136–138 |volume=39 |issue=1 |doi=10.1068/p6626 |first=Michael B. |last=Lewis |pmid=20301855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6748">The '''ispolin''' ({{lang-bg|исполин}}; pronounced {{IPA-bg|ispoˈlin|}}, plural исполини ''ispolini'') is a legendary [[giant (mythology)|giant]] in [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] [[mythology]]. While the appearance of the ispolin varied according to the myth and region, ispolini were believed to have inhabited the [[Earth]] before humans and to have been considerably taller.

==Etymology==
''Ispolin'' with the meaning of "giant" appears in [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] [[Old Church Slavonic]] texts as early as the 11th century. [[Russia]]n linguist [[Max Vasmer]] believes the word's [[etymology]] is tied to ''spali'', a name for the defeated [[Goths]] inhabiting what is today southern Russia. The word appears as ''Spalaei'' in 1st-century [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] author [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]].&lt;ref name="vasmer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Фасмер|first=Макс|authorlink=Max Vasmer|script-title=ru:Этимологический словарь русского языка|date=1964–1973|publisher=Прогресс|location=Москва|language=Russian|chapter=исполин|oclc=639928003|chapterurl=http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/query.cgi?basename=\usr\local\share\starling\morpho\vasmer\vasmer&amp;root=/usr/local/share/starling/morpho&amp;morpho=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and appearance==
[[File:Ripe blackberries in foreground.jpg|right|thumb|According to Bulgarian mythology, [[blackberry]] bushes posed the greatest threat to ispolini, who would trip in their thorns and die]]
Bulgarian [[founding myth]]s refer to the ispolini as the second out of three generations of people to inhabit the Earth, the third generation being modern humans. The first people that God created were [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] or little people, i.e. ''dzhudzheta'' (джуджета, singular джудже ''dzhudzhe''). However, because of their low stature these people were unable to protect themselves from wild animals or to effectively cultivate the land, and thus they died out.&lt;ref name="stoynev"&gt;{{cite book|last=Стойнев|first=Анани|author2=Димитър Попов |author3=Маргарита Василева |author4=Рачко Попов |title=Българска митология. Енциклопедичен речник|year=2006|publisher=изд. Захари Стоянов|language=Bulgarian|isbn=954-739-682-X|pages=147–148|chapter=Исполини}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dwarves were succeeded by ispolini, whom Bulgarians believed God created as the opposite of dwarves. Various myths describe them as up to {{convert|3|m|ft}} tall and having huge heads, while other legends portray ispolini as possessing three heads and a single eye, the size of an egg, on their forehead, or a single leg. In some aspects, the ispolin bears a resemblance to the [[cyclops]] of ancient [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref name="stoynev"/&gt; Besides their height, ispolini also possessed supernatural powers.&lt;ref name="bultree"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bultreebank.org/veda/lingvbg.htm|title=За лексикалните особености на песните от сборника "Веда Словена".|publisher=BulTreeBank|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=1 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311164745/http://www.bultreebank.org/veda/lingvbg.htm|archivedate=11 March 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iliev"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Илиев|first=Атанас|year=1890|title=Бъларски предания за исполини, наречени елини, жидови и латини|journal=Сборник за народни умотворения|publisher=Българско книжовно дружество|issue=3|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ispolini were believed to have inhabited the prehistoric mountains. Their voices were thought so powerful that they were able to communicate between each other even when they were standing on far-away mountain tops. Ispolini lived in caves and were carnivorous, feeding exclusively on raw meat. They were regarded as a natural enemy of [[Slavic dragon|dragons]] (змейове ''zmeyove'') and would often engage them in battle.&lt;ref name="stoynev"/&gt;

Despite their physical strength and stature, ispolini were not invulnerable. Bulgarian legends claim that the most dangerous object for an ispolin was the [[blackberry]] bush. Due to their height and sluggishness, ispolini were unable to spot or avoid blackberry bushes, so they would trip, get caught in the thorns and perish. Perceiving the blackberry as a great and powerful danger, ispolini were believed to offer sacrifices (курбан ''[[Kourbania|kurban]]'') to the blackberry in order to propitiate it.&lt;ref name="stoynev"/&gt;

However, the legend goes, God destroyed ispolini because he judged that they were, just like dwarves, not suited for life on Earth. In many regions of Bulgaria, large heaps of stones, often ruins of ancient buildings, are interpreted as ispolin graveyards. It was common practice that when a person passed such an area, they would throw a stone as a form of denouncement (''[[anathema]]'').&lt;ref name="stoynev"/&gt;

Because ispolini and thus their "graveyards" were also known under the names елини ''elini'' ("Hellenes"), латини ''latini'' ("Latins") and жидове ''zhidove'' ("Jews"), such heaps are attributed to the pre-[[Christianity|Christian]] civilizations that inhabited the [[Balkans]]. Ruins that were commonly tied to the mythological ispolini could be found near [[Samokov]], [[Veliko Tarnovo]], [[Malko Tarnovo]] and [[Ihtiman]].&lt;ref name="stoynev"/&gt; Bulgarian scholars interpret the association of Latins and Greeks with legendary ancient giants as a result of the wars that [[Bulgarian Empire|medieval Bulgaria]] waged against these people. Humans who were often forced to wage war were thought to be inherently strong and bulky.&lt;ref name="bultree"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iliev"/&gt;

==Alternative names==
Ispolini were known under a large number of alternative names, depending on the region of Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="stoynev"/&gt;

'''Joseph Jacobs''' (29 August 1854 – 30 January 1916) was an Australian [[folklorist]], translator, literary critic, social scientist, historian and writer of English literature who became a notable  collector and  publisher of [[English folklore]]. 

Jacobs was born in [[Sydney]] to a Jewish family. 
His work went on to popularize some of the world's best known versions of English fairy tales including "[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]", "[[The Story of the Three Bears|Goldilocks and the three bears]]", "[[The Three Little Pigs]]", "[[Jack the Giant Killer]]" and "[[Tom Thumb|The History of Tom Thumb]]". He published his English fairy tale collections: ''English Fairy Tales'' in 1890 and ''More English Fairy Tales'' in 1893{{efn|name=year}} but also went on after and in between both books to publish fairy tales collected from continental Europe as well as Jewish, Celtic and Indian fairytales which made him one of the most popular writers of fairytales for the English language. Jacobs was also an editor for journals and books on the subject of [[folklore]] which included editing the [[Panchatantra|Fables of Bidpai]] and the [[Aesop's Fables|Fables of Aesop]], as well as articles on the migration of Jewish folklore. He also edited editions of ''[[The Thousand and One Nights]]''. He went on to join [[The Folklore Society]] in England and became an editor of the society journal ''Folklore''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.storyteller.net/articles/136|title=Storyteller.net: Storytelling, Storytellers, Stories, Storytelling Techniques, Hear a Story, Read Stories, Audio Stories, Find Tellers, How to Tell A Story  - Articles About Storytelling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Jacobs also contributed to ''[[The Jewish Encyclopedia]]''.

During his lifetime, Jacobs came to be regarded as one of the foremost experts on English folklore.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Jacobs was born in Sydney, Australia on 29 August 1854.{{sfnm|1a1=Sulzberger|1y=1917|1p=68|2a1=Phillips|2y=1954|2p=126|3a1=Fine|3y=1987|3p=183}}
He was the sixth surviving son of John Jacobs, a [[publican]] who had emigrated from London around 1837, and his wife Sarah, ''née'' Myers.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;G. F. J. Bergman, "[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090451b.htm Jacobs, Joseph (1854 - 1916)]", ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 9, [[Melbourne University Press|MUP]], 1983, pp. 460-461. Retrieved 2009-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs was educated at [[Sydney Grammar School]] and at the [[University of Sydney]], where he won a scholarship for classics, mathematics and chemistry. He did not complete his studies in Sydney, but left for England at the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=JCBS873J|name=Jacobs, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Cambridge - St John College - New Court.jpg|thumb|left|Jacobs attained his BA from St John's College, Cambridge]]

He moved to England to study at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St. John's College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he gained a BA in 1876.{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=68}} At university, he demonstrated a particular interest in mathematics, philosophy, literature, history, and anthropology.{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=68}} While in Britain, Jacobs became aware of widespread [[anti-Semitism]]; to counter this, he wrote an essay, "Mordecai", which was published in the June 1877 edition of ''[[Macmillan's Magazine]]''.{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=69}} In 1877 he moved to [[Berlin]] to study Jewish literature and bibliography under [[Moritz Steinschneider]] and Jewish philosophy and ethnology under [[Moritz Lazarus]].{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=70}}

Jacobs returned to England, where he studied anthropology under [[Francis Galton]].{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=70}} At this point, he began to further develop his interest in folklore.{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=70}} 
From 1878 to 1884 he served as secretary of the [[Society of Hebrew Literature]].{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=70}} He was concerned by the anti-Semitic pogroms in the [[Russian Empire]] and in January 1882 wrote letters on the subject to the ''[[London Times]]''. This helped raise public attention to the issue, resulting in the formation of the [[Mansion House Fund and Committee]], of which he was secretary from 1882 to 1900.{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=70}} He was the honorary secretary of the literature and art committee of the [[Anglo-Jewish Historical Exhibition]]—held in London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 1887—and with [[Lucien Wolf]] compiled the exhibit's catalogue.{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=70}}

In 1888, Jacobs visited Spain to examine old Jewish manuscripts there; while in the country the Royal Academy of History at Madrid elected him a corresponding member.{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=71}}
In 1891, he returned to the theme of Russian anti-Semitism for a short book, "The Persecution of the Jews in Russia", which was published first in London and then republished in the United States by the [[Jewish Publication Society of America]].{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=71}}
In 1896, Jacobs began publication of the annual Jewish Year Book, continuing the series until 1899, after which it was continued by others.{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=71}}

In Britain, he was also President of the [[Jewish Historical Society]].{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=73}}

===Later life===

In 1896, Jacobs visited the United States to deliver his lectures on "The Philosophy of Jewish History" to [[Gratz College]] in Philadelphia and to groups of the [[Council of Jewish Women]] at New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago.{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|pp=71–72}}
In 1900, he was invited to serve as revising editor for the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', which included entries from 600 contributors.{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=72}} He moved to the United States to take on this task.{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=72}} There he involved himself in the [[American Jewish Historical Society]].{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=72}} He became a working member of the [[Jewish Publication Society]]'s publication committee.{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|pp=72–73}}

In the U.S., Jacobs also taught at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]].{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=73}}

Jacobs married Georgina Horne and fathered two sons and a daughter.  In 1900, when he became revising editor of the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', based in New York, he settled permanently in the United States.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

He died on 30 January 1916 at his home in [[Yonkers, New York]], aged 62.{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=68}}&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:The book of wonder voyages (1919).djvu|thumb| 1919 edition of ''The Book of Wonder Voyages'' (1896) ]]

He was a student of anthropology at the Statistical Laboratory at University College London in the 1880s under [[Francis Galton]]. His ''Studies in Jewish Statistics: Social, Vital and Anthropometric'' (1891) made his reputation as the first proponent of Jewish race science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Langton|first=Daniel|year=2014|title=Jewish Evolutionary Perspectives on Judaism, Anti-Semitism, and Race Science in Late 19th Century England: A Comparative Study of Lucien Wolf and Joseph Jacobs|url=https://www.academia.edu/10403965/Langton_D._Jewish_Evolutionary_Perspectives_on_Judaism_Anti-Semitism_and_Race_Science_in_Late_19th_Century_England_A_Comparative_Study_of_Lucien_Wolf_and_Joseph_Jacobs._Jewish_Historical_Studies_46_2014_37-73|journal=Jewish Historical Studies|volume=46|pages=37–73|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, he was appointed a member of the board of seven, which made a new English translation of the Bible for the [[Jewish Publication Society]] of America.

In 1913, he resigned his positions at the seminary to become editor of the ''[[American Hebrew]]''.

In 1920, Book I of his ''Jewish Contributions to Civilization'', which was practically finished at the time of his death, was published at Philadelphia.

In addition to the books already mentioned, Jacobs edited ''The Fables of Aesop'' as First Printed by [[William Caxton|Caxton]] (1889), ''[[Painter's Palace of Pleasure]]'' (1890), ''Baltaser Gracian's Art of Worldly Wisdom'' (1892), ''Howell's Letters'' (1892), ''Barlaam and Josaphat'' (1896), ''The Thousand and One Nights'' (6 vols, 1896), and others. Jacobs was also a contributor to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', and [[James Hastings]]' ''[[Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics]]''.

==Folklore==
[[File:A Legend of Knockmany - Illustration 1.jpg|thumb|left| Illustration of "A Legend of Knockmany" by [[John D. Batten]] for ''Celtic Fairy Tales'' (1892) ]]

Jacobs edited the journal ''[[Folklore (journal)|Folklore]]'' from 1899 to 1900 and from 1890 to 1916 he edited multiple collections of fairy tales that were published with illustrations by [[John Dickson Batten]]: ''English Fairy Tales'', ''Celtic Fairy Tales'', ''Indian Fairy Tales'',  ''More English Fairy Tales'', ''More Celtic Fairy Tales'' (all 1890 to 1895) and ''Europa's Fairy Book'' (also issued as ''European Folk and Fairy Tales'') in 1916.&lt;ref name="surlalunefairytales.com"&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/illustrations/illustrators/batten.html|title=SurLaLune Fairytales - Illustration Gallery - John D. Batten (1860-1932) British|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was inspired in this by the [[Brothers Grimm]] and the [[romantic nationalism]] common in folklorists of his age; he wished English children to have access to English fairy tales, whereas they were chiefly reading French and German tales;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, p. 345, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his own words, "What [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]] began, the Grimms completed."

Although he collected many tales under the name of [[fairy tale]]s, many of them are unusual sorts of tales.  [[Binnorie]] (in ''English Fairy Tales'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jacobs, Joseph |author2=Batten, John D. |year=1890|title=English Fairy Tales}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tamlane]] (in ''More English Fairy Tales'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jacobs, Joseph |author2=Batten, John D. |year=1894|title=Tamlane|journal=More English Fairy Tales |edition=2nd |publisher=London: David Nutt|pages= 159–62 |isbn= 0-370-01023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; are prose versions of [[ballad]]s, The Old Woman and Her Pig (in ''English Fairy Tales'') is a [[nursery rhyme]], [[Henny Penny|Henny-Penny]] (in ''English Fairy Tales'') is a [[fable]], and [[The Buried Moon]] (in ''More English Fairy Tales'') has [[Mythopoeia|mythic]] overtones to an extent unusual in fairy tales.  According to his own analysis of ''English Fairy Tales'', "Of the eighty-seven tales contained in my two volumes, thirty-eight are [[Fairy tale|Märchen proper]], ten [[saga]]s or [[legend]]s, nineteen [[droll]]s, four [[Cumulative tale|cumulative stories]], six [[Beast fable|beast tales]], and ten [[Literary nonsense|nonsense stories]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph Jacobs -  ''English Fairy Tales'' (notes and references) |url=http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/jacobs/english/notes.html |website=surlalunefairytales.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

==Reception and legacy==

During his lifetime, Jacobs came to be regarded as "one of the leading English authorities" on folklore,{{sfn|Phillips|1954|p=126}} and "the leading authority on fairy tales and the migration of fables".{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=73}} Writing in 1954, O. Somech Philips noted that while Jacobs accomplished many things in his life, it was as a folklorist that "people remember him best".{{sfn|Phillips|1954|p=127}}

Writing Jacobs' obituary for ''[[The American Jewish Year Book]]'', Mayer Sulzberger characterised him as "one of the important figures in the Jewry of our age", adding that he was "in himself a type of the humanity and universality of the Jewish people."{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=68}} Sulzberger praised Jacobs' literary style, commenting that he "wrote with ease and grace" and "might have attained a high place in the illustrious roll of honor of Britain's literary worthies" had he pursued a career in literature.{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|pp=68–69}} Sulzberger described him as having "a noble nature, incapable of envy", as well an "insatiable thirst for knowledge"; he was "always ready to welcome a fellow-inquirer."{{sfn|Sulzberger|1917|p=74}}

The '''''Kanmiu Buque Qieyun''''' (刊謬補缺切韻) by Wang Renxu (王仁昫), which was published in 706, is the oldest extant [[China|Chinese]] [[rime dictionary]]. For many centuries believed lost, a copy was found at the imperial palace in [[Beijing]] in 1947. Lóng 1968 published an eye copy with annotations. Zhou 1983: 434-527 includes a facsimile of the original, which unfortunately is not very legible.

'''''Lancashire Rock''''' is the official guidebook to rock climbing in [[Lancashire]]. Originally put together in 1969 by Les Ainsworth and supporting volunteers, there have since been seven revisions to the guidebook. The guidebook is now under the control of the [[British Mountaineering Council]], and the latest revision contains some 6,600 [[climbing]] routes either in a [[quarry]] or on a [[cliff|crag]] and making it one of the biggest climbing guidebooks in the [[UK]].

[[File:Marischal College - geograph.org.uk - 305815.jpg|thumb|The entrance to the Marischal Museum, at the rear part of Marischal College, seen prior to restoration]]
'''Marischal Museum''' was a [[museum]] in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], specialising in [[anthropology]] and artifacts from cultures around the world. Part of the [[University of Aberdeen]], it was situated at [[Marischal College]], a grand [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic building]] said to be the second-largest granite building in the world, displaying collections owned by the University. The museum is closed to the public, but now operates at the University of Aberdeen’s museum collections centre.

==Notable Collections==
The museum most notably housed examples of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Classical antiquity|Classical antiquities]], non-Western [[ethnography]] and pieces relating to [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[prehistory]] and [[numismatics]]. The collections are part of the University of Aberdeen’s museum collections which have been Recognised as being of national significance by the Scottish Government.

==Closure==
The museum has been closed since July 2008 due to renovation work at [[Marischal College]]. Although part of Marischal College re-opened after renovation in Summer 2011 as the corporate headquarters of Aberdeen City Council, the museum remains closed to the public.  It now operates as a museum collections centre, with conservation laboratory, research stores, offices and workshop, supporting the work of the University of Aberdeen’s museums elsewhere. 

To allow the public to continue to view exhibits from its collections, in April 2011 the [[University of Aberdeen]] opened [[King's Museum]]. This is a small museum (much smaller than Marischal Museum) located in the Old Aberdeen Town House, which is part of the King’s College campus in [[Old Aberdeen]], King's Museum hosts a range of changing [[exhibitions]], drawing on objects from the University's stored collections, primarily those formerly displayed in Marischal Museum.

'''''Murray's Handbooks for Travellers''''' were travel [[guide book]]s published in London by [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] beginning in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title='What Ought to Be Seen': Tourists' Guidebooks and National Identities in Modern Germany and Europe |author= Rudy Koshar |journal= Journal of Contemporary History |volume= 33 |date=July 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series covered tourist destinations in Europe and parts of Asia and northern Africa. According to scholar James Buzard, the Murray style "exemplified the exhaustive rational planning that was as much an ideal of the emerging tourist industry as it was of British commercial and industrial organization generally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Uses of Romanticism: Byron and the Victorian Continental Tour |author=James Buzard |journal= Victorian Studies |volume= 35 |date=Autumn 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The guidebooks became popular enough to appear in works of fiction such as [[Charles Lever]]'s ''Dodd Family Abroad.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Continent of Pictures: Reflections on the "Europe" of Nineteenth-Century Tourists |author= James Buzard |journal= PMLA |volume= 108 |date=January 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1915 the series continued as the ''[[Blue Guides]]''.

'''''Myths to Live By''''' is a 1972 book, a collection of essays, originally given as lectures at the [[Cooper Union]] Forum, by [[mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]] between 1958 and 1971. The work has an introduction by Johnson E. Fairchild.

The deep power of [[mythology|myth]] on the inner, spiritual lives of human beings throughout the ages (including our own age) is the common theme running throughout all of the essays in the collection. Campbell explains the differences between western and oriental myths and rites. He shows how fundamental universal thoughts are adapted to local requirements of legitimation. A typical form of adaptation of the ''hero'' is the American image of the ''lone rider'' who dispels evil.&lt;ref&gt;Edition London 1985, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Polovchak]] was living in [[Chicago]] when his parents decided to return to [[Ukraine]], then part of the [[USSR]]. He objected, which prompted the case.

The sympathetic [[Reagan administration]] dragged on the case. He was no longer a minor when he turned 18 before a final decision was rendered. He was then allowed to remain in the United States.

A court ruled that parents who are citizens of another country cannot remove their own child from the United States to their native land over the objection of their child unless the child is first afforded a hearing, to determine whether living in another nation is in the child's interests.

The case has similarities to that of [[Elián González]], who some claimed he did not want to return to [[Cuba]].

[[Image:Kouros' Head to horse, Acropolis' museum, Athens.jpg|thumb|''Rampin Rider'' at the Acropolis Museum]]
The '''''Rampin Rider''''' or '''''Rampin Horseman''''' (c. 550 BC) is an [[equestrian statue]] from the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Period]] of [[Ancient Greece]].  The statue was masterfully made of marble and has traces of red and black paint.  

The head of the rider was found on the [[Acropolis of Athens]] in 1877 and donated to the [[Louvre]].  Parts of the body of the rider and horse were found ten years earlier in a ditch filled with statues broken during the 480 BC Persian sack of Athens.  The head was not associated with the rest of the statue until 1936.  The statue is displayed with a plaster cast of the head at the [[Acropolis Museum]] while the head remains at the Louvre where it is displayed with a cast of the rest of the statue. 

The rider has many of the features typical of an Archaic [[kouros]], but has several asymmetrical features that break with the period's conventions.

==Interpretations==
The statue was originally thought to be a part of a set of statues, perhaps paired with another as a mounted presentation of [[Castor and Pollux]] common on vases from this period. According to another theory, the statue represents the winner of a race.  This theory is supported by the crown of [[lovage]], given to winners of the [[Nemean Games]] and the [[Isthmian Games]], on the statue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5866">The '''Riegner Telegram''' was a [[telegraphy|telegraph]] message sent on 8 August 1942 from [[Gerhart Riegner]], then Secretary of [[World Jewish Congress]] ([[Geneva]]), to its New York and London offices.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Yehuda (2001). ''Rethinking the Holocaust'' (Yale University Press, New Haven and London) p.219&lt;/ref&gt;  The cable confirmed the alarming reports that had reached the West previously about the German intention to mass murder the European Jews.&lt;ref name="Gutman36"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gutman |first=Israel (ed.) |title=Encyclopedia of the Holocaust |location=New York |publisher=Mamillan Publishing Co. |year=1990 |work=S. v.

Riegner was office manager of the WJC in Geneva. He was indirectly informed about the German plans for the [[final solution]] by German industrialist [[Eduard Schulte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hilberg|first1=Raul|title=The Destruction of the European Jews|date=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300095579|edition=3rd|page=1201}} Schulte informed Isidor Koppelmann (business associate), who informed Benjamin Sagalowitz (head of the press agency of the Union of Jewish Communities in Switzerland), who in turn informed Riegner.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his British and American diplomatic channels (Rabbi [[Stephen Samuel Wise]] of the [[American Jewish Congress]] in New York and [[Sydney Silverman]], a Jewish Member of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and Chairman of the British Section, World Jewish Congress) Riegner sent the following message to his contacts via the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|British Foreign Office]] and the State Department in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/haventohome/haven-home.html#obj17 "Riegner Telegram".] United States Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Riegner Telegram.jpg|thumb|upright|Original telegram.]]

{{quote|Received alarming report stating that, in the Fuehrer's Headquarters, a plan has been discussed, and is under consideration, according to which all Jews in countries occupied or controlled by Germany numbering 3½ to 4 millions should, after deportation and concentration in the East, be at one blow exterminated, in order to resolve, once and for all the Jewish question in Europe.  Action is reported to be planned for the autumn. Ways of execution are still being discussed including the use of [[prussic acid]].  We transmit this information with all the necessary reservation, as exactitude cannot be confirmed by us.  Our informant is reported to have close connexions with the highest German authorities, and his reports are generally reliable.

However, in [[England]] and the [[United States]], Riegner's telegram was met with disbelief. The [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] considered the telegram "a wild rumor, fueled by Jewish anxieties" while the British Foreign Office didn't forward the telegram for some time. Only on the 28 August 1942 did it find its way to the President of the [[World Jewish Congress]], Rabbi [[Stephen Wise]], who decided to not make it public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Yehuda Bauer]] | title = The Holocaust, America, and American Jewry | journal = Israel Journal of foreign Affairs | volume = VI |  issue = 1 | year = 2012 | url = http://israelcfr.com/documents/6-1/6-1-6-Bauer.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325191332/http://israelcfr.com/documents/6-1/6-1-6-Bauer.pdf|archive-date=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1944, [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]] stated in front of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D.

A '''roll of arms''' (or '''armorial''') is a collection of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], usually consisting of rows of painted pictures of shields, each shield accompanied by the name of the person bearing the arms.

The oldest extant armorials date to the mid 13th century, and armorial manuscripts continued to be produced throughout the [[Early Modern period]].
''[[Siebmachers Wappenbuch]]'' of 1605 was an early instance of a printed armorial. Medieval armorials usually include a few hundred coats of arms, in the late medieval period sometimes up to some 2,000. In the early modern period,  the larger armorials develop into encyclopedic projects, with the  ''Armorial général de France'' (1696), commissioned by [[Louis XIV of France]], listing more than 125,000 coats of arms. In the modern period, the tradition develops into projects of heraldic dictionaries edited in multiple volumes, such as the ''Dictionary of British Arms''  in four volumes (1926&amp;ndash;2009), or ''J. Siebmacher's großes Wappenbuch'' in seven volumes (1854&amp;ndash;1967).

Armorials can be "occasional", relating to a specific event such as a tournament; "institutional", associated with foundations, such as that of an [[order of chivalry]], "regional", collecting the arms of the nobility of a given region, "illustrative", in the context of a specific narrative or chronicle, or "general", with the aim of an encyclopedic collection.&lt;ref&gt;''A New Dictionary of Heraldry'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt;
A roll of arms arranged systematically by design, with coats featuring the same principal elements (geometrical [[Ordinary (heraldry)|ordinaries]] and [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]]) grouped together as a tool to aid identification, is known as an [[ordinary of arms]] (or simply as an ordinary).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3557">The '''Subject Headings Authority [[File sharing|File]]''' ({{lang-de|Schlagwortnormdatei}}) or '''SWD''' is a [[controlled vocabulary]] [[index term]] system used primarily for [[subject indexing]] in [[library catalog]]s. The SWD is managed by the [[German National Library]] (DNB) in cooperation with various [[library]] networks. The inclusion of keywords in the SWD is defined by "Rules for the Keyword Catalogue" (RSWK). Similar [[Authority control|authority systems]] in other languages include the ''[[Library of Congress Subject Headings]]'' (LCSH) and the {{Interlanguage link|RAMEAU|lt=''RAMEAU''|WD=Q13421502}} ({{lang-fr|Répertoire d'autorité-matière encyclopédique et alphabétique unifié}}). Since April 2012 the SWD is part of the [[Integrated Authority File]] (''Gemeinsame Normdatei'' or GND).

== Scope ==
The SWD has about 600,000 [[Index term|descriptors]] and 700,000 non-descriptors ([[synonym]]s and quasi-synonyms) as well as synonymous descriptor chains with references to a descriptor. Its growth rate is about 5.5% per year. About three-quarters of the descriptors refer to individual concepts (language identifier, person, entity, title, ethnography etc.) and a quarter are abstract concepts. Linking using hierarchical (about 115,000) and associative (26,000) relations is not very dense, so the SWD cannot be viewed as a [[thesaurus]]'' (as at mid-2003)''.

The terms in the SWD are also arranged in a separate [[Library classification|classification]] with nearly 500 classes in 36 main groups.

== Structure ==
The various terms are placed in a classification scheme and also contain references to sources, related terms, preferred term and to a lesser extent hierarchical links. But the SWD is probably not a complete thesaurus because of the low degree of linkage. The SWD is available online through the catalogue database ILTIS and is available for a fee as BIBLIODATA, together with the [[Name Authority File]] (PND) and the [[Corporate Bodies Authority File]] (GKD) on the standard data CD-ROM and the standard file TITAN. In both cases, the user interface of the SWD leaves much room for improvement. Instead of making SWD accessible as a user-friendly navigation tool, it assumes that users are familiar with SWD and its classification scheme and enter the appropriate descriptor in the correct form before running a search. Navigating the system or moving from one concept to another by means of hyperlinks is not possible. The strategy of the German Library to distribute authority records commercially makes the extended use of the SWD difficult, e.g. in other keyword systems.

For the exchange of authority records, there is a separate Machine Exchange Format for Libraries (''MAB'') format. The head official of the Southwest German Library Network (SWB) offers online access (OSWD).

The company is a [[review aggregator|product review aggregator]], meaning that both expert/professional- and user reviews are aggregated from thousands of sources in many different languages using an advanced backend system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netimperative.com/news/2007/04/30/PriceRunner |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719055342/http://www.netimperative.com/news/2007/04/30/PriceRunner |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }} TestFreaks to launch&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the aggregated reviews, TestFreaks also operates post-purchase customer review collection and moderation service in several different languages. 

The consumer website TestFreaks is a [[review site]] launched 2007 in several different languages. The website allows users to read reviews and compare prices of a wide range of products. Since 2011, the company has gradually increased their solutions to suit e-commerce websites, retailers and manufacturers. 

== History ==
TestFreaks was launched in 2007 by the former Founders of [[PriceRunner]], Kristofer Arwin, Magnus Wiberg, and Martin Alexanderson. Northzone, an investor in PriceRunner, also invested in TestFreaks.&lt;ref&gt;http://mashable.com/2007/05/03/testfreaks/ TestFreaks Launches Alpha Review Site&lt;/ref&gt;

Every product is assigned a FreakScore that is calculated with an algorithm that factors things such as the age of the product and when each review was written. It also puts different weight on different sources, e.g. if [[cNet]] or [[HowStuffWorks]] has reviewed a product and rated it 10 out of 10 that will impact the FreakScore differently.&lt;ref&gt;http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/2735-q-a-kristofer-arwin-of-review-site-testfreaks Interview with TestFreaks Review Site&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, TestFreaks launched a badge product &lt;ref&gt;http://www.testfreaks.com/info/badge/ badge product&lt;/ref&gt; allowing retailers to include product scores, pros and cons and review snippets directly onto their product and category listings pages. In a short time more than 100 retailers adopted the system which is also capable of collecting reviews from customers on the site and through post-purchase emails. 

In 2012, an API was launched to provide similar content which could sit alongside existing tabs. With the increasing interest from retailers, TestFreaks also started operating pro-active post-purchase review collection and moderation service. This creates unique content for a retailer which is fully indexed to give SEO value as well as increase conversion rate. Service reviews can also be collected to gather feedback about the customer experience.

In 2015, TestFreaks launched its Q&amp;A module, which can be implemented using a simple script. This allows retailers to collect, answer and publish questions and answers as a way of increasing conversion rate and lower the [[bounce rate]].

By 2017, TestFreaks has been successful in moving large retailers from industry leaders such as [[Bazaarvoice]] and Reevoo, saving them huge sums in monthly subscription fees, whilst providing a very similar service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/01/prweb11487649.htm|title=TestFreaks to Launch in US After Bazaarvoice’s Anti-trust Ruling|work=PRWeb|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Ultimate Sniper: An Advanced Training Manual for Military and Police Snipers'''''  is a non-fiction book written by [[John Plaster]] and published in 1993. An expanded and updated version was published in 2006.

==Background==
Plaster, a retired U.S. Army major, wrote his book after three tours in the Vietnam War, where he worked behind enemy lines in Laos and Cambodia as part of the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group|Studies and Observation Group]].&lt;ref name=Tel/&gt;
==Overview==
Also included in the book is some history on sniping, including background on the British Army's first sniper unit, the Scottish Highland [[Lovat Scouts]].  These scouts fought in the [[Second Boer War]] and were fittingly described as "half wolf and half jackrabbit" by their leader, [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], an American who served as Chief of Scouts for the British Army in Southern Africa. All of this material is covered in much greater detail in Plaster's illustrated book, ''The History of Sniping and Sharpshooting''.
==Legacy==
The book came under the spotlight in October 2006 when a video about "[[Juba (sniper)|Juba]] the sniper", who allegedly killed more than 20 U.S. soldiers in Iraq, mentioned it as an inspiration.&lt;ref name=Tel&gt;{{cite news |last1=Watson |first1=Robert |title=Iraqi rebels learn from US sniper guru|location=United Kingdom|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1532725/Iraqi-rebels-learn-from-US-sniper-guru.html|work=The Telegraph |date=29 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Time'' 100''' (often stylized as '''''TIME'' 100''') is an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world assembled by the [[United States|American]] [[news magazine]] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. First published in 1999 as the result of a debate among American academics, politicians, and journalists, the list is now a highly publicized annual event. Although appearing on the list is often seen as an honor, ''Time'' makes it clear that entrants are recognized for changing the world, regardless of the consequences of their actions. The final list of influential individuals is exclusively chosen by ''Time'' editors with nominations coming from the ''TIME'' 100 alumni and the magazine's international writing staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV6HM4atxEw|title=See who made TIME's 100 most influential list|date=24 April 2014|work=YouTube|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the winner of the Reader's Poll, conducted days before the official list is revealed, is chosen by the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://time.com/56140/time-100-2014-poll/ | title=The 100 Most Influential People in the World: Readers' Poll | work=Time | date=10 April 2014 | accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barack Obama]] has appeared on the list 11 times, the most of any person.

Managing editor of ''Time'', [[Nancy Gibbs]] says of the year's list:

{{cquote|
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Time'' 100 is a list of the world’s most influential men and women, not its most powerful, though those are not mutually exclusive terms. Power, as we’ve seen this year, can be crude and implacable, from Vladimir Putin’s mugging of Crimea to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s summary execution of his uncle and mentor Jang Song Thaek. Those men made our list, but they are the outliers, and not just because we generally seek to celebrate the best work of the human spirit. The vast majority of this year’s roster reveals that while power is certain, influence is subtle. Power is a tool, influence is a skill; one is a fist, the other a fingertip. You don’t lead by hitting people over the head, Dwight Eisenhower used to say. That’s "assault, not leadership."

To assemble the list, we rely on our journalists around the world and our ''Time'' 100 alumni (many of whom are as influential as ever).

If there is a common theme in many of the tributes, it’s the eagerness to see what some engineer, actor, leader or athlete will do next. As much as this exercise chronicles the achievements of the past year, we also focus on figures whose influence is likely to grow, so we can look around the corner to see what is coming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The Ties That Bind the 100 | url=http://time.com/75192/the-ties-that-bind-the-time-100/ | work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Selection criteria==
In 2004, ''Time''{{'s}} editors "identified three rather distinct qualities", when choosing the ''Time'' 100 explained ''Time''{{'s}} editor-at-large Michael Elliott:
&lt;blockquote&gt;First, there were those who came to their status by means of a very public possession of power; President George W. Bush is the pre-eminent example. Others, though they are rarely heard from in public, nonetheless have a real influence on the great events of our time. Think of Ali Husaini Sistani, the Grand Ayatullah of Iraq's Shi'ites. Still others affect our lives through their moral example. Consider Nelson Mandela's forgiveness of his captors and his willingness to walk away from the South African presidency after a single term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,670354,00.html |title=TIME Names The World's Most Influential People |publisher=Time Warner |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 2007 ''Time'' 100 list, managing editor [[Richard Stengel]] explained that the ''Time'' 100 was not a list of the hottest, most popular, or most powerful people, but rather the most influential, stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Influence is hard to measure, and what we look for is people whose ideas, whose example, whose talent, whose discoveries transform the world we live in. Influence is less about the hard power of force than the soft power of ideas and example. Yes, there are Presidents and dictators who can change the world through fiat, but we're more interested in innovators like [[Monty Jones]], the [[Sierra Leone]] scientist who has developed a strain of rice that can save African agriculture. Or heroes like the great chessmaster [[Garry Kasparov]], who is leading the lonely fight for greater democracy in Russia. Or Academy Award winning actor [[George Clooney]] who has leveraged his celebrity to bring attention to the [[War in Darfur|tragedy in Darfur]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Time'' 100 Award==
From 2005 to 2008, ''Time'' magazine awarded each ''Time'' 100 honoree Darko Mladenovic's Ray crystal sculpture produced by Swarovski.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.brand.swarovski.com/Content.Node/presscentre/news/news-specialprojects/darko.fr.html#/fr/presscentre/news/news-specialprojects/darko|title = Darko Mladenovic's Ray sculpture was awarded to TIME 100's World's Most Influential People|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
The fact that the then British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] was excluded from the 2004 list caused mild controversy. ''Time'' editor-at-large Michael Elliott defended the decision to consistently exclude Blair:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Gerhard Schröder]] and [[Jacques Chirac]] are not there either. This is a worldwide list. There are no Western European political leaders on it because they are not that powerful or influential at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012120331/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20040418/ai_n12754149 Exclusive: Time 100 list; Revealed: the world's 100 most influential | Independent on Sunday, The | Find Articles at BNET.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although George W. Bush has been on the list several times, controversy emerged when he was dropped from the list in 2007 in part because of the Democratic victory in the [[United States elections, 2006|2006 congressional election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/bush-missing-in-times-list/top/39741-2.html |title=Osama in Time magazine power list |work =Ibnlive.com |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Senator [[Rick Santorum]] (R–PA) of [[Fox News]] said: &lt;blockquote&gt;The fact of the matter is, the president of the United States, I don't care who's in that office, is the most powerful man on the face of the Earth and has more influence over various aspects of lives, not just in this country, but around the world. And for ''Time'' magazine to dismiss that just shows you how biased and, I would argue, hateful they are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,270086,00.html |title=President Bush Not 'Influential' Enough for Time |author1=Sean Hannity |author2=Alan Colmes |work=FOX News |date=May 4, 2007 |accessdate=May 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510075018/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,270086,00.html |archive-date=May 10, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Any U.S. president has a certain built-in influence", explained [[Adi Ignatius]], ''Time''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s deputy managing editor who oversaw the list at the time. "Bush had actually squandered some of that built-in influence. His position on [[Iraq War|Iraq]] has cost him support in his own party...To a certain point, he sort of reached a [[Lame duck (politics)|lame-duck]] status".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2007/May/03/br/br6872913405.html |title=Obama among Time's list of 100 most influential|work =The Honolulu Advertiser |date=May 3, 2007 |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list has generated controversy over who was included in other years as well. In 2005, conservative commentator [[Ann Coulter]] was listed, which led [[Salon.com|''Salon'']] to observe:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When ''Time'' magazine named Ann Coulter among its 100 "most influential people" last week, alongside such heavyweights as [[Ariel Sharon]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Kim Jong Il]], and the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], the choice produced guffaws online. Plugging the issue on [[Fox News]] last week, ''Time'' executive editor [[Priscilla Painton]] insisted it was Coulter's use of "humor" that made her so influential, stopping just short of suggesting that Coulter is the conservative [[Jon Stewart]]. But even Fox's [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] wasn't buying it. He pressed Painton: "Do you think people, Americans, listen to Ann Coulter? Do you think she has influence in public opinion?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boehlert |first=Eric |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/04/19/coulter/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517210718/http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/04/19/coulter/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 17, 2006 |title=Time hearts Ann Coulter |work=Salon.com |date=April 19, 2005 |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Time'' magazine defended Coulter as a bestselling author whose controversial commentary strongly affected the United States' political debates; she did not, however, make additional appearances on the list.

In 2010, ''Time'' faced mild oppositions when they excluded [[Bollywood]] actor [[Shahrukh Khan]] from their list, even though he was said to be very much "in the race". Khan's fan following has been claimed to be one of the biggest in contemporary cinema and this decision came as a surprise to readers from many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ndtv.com/photos/entertainment/sachin-srk-in-world-s-most-influential-race-7176/slide/3|title=Why Shahrukh Khan was not among Time magazine’s 100 most influential people|work=[[NDTV]]|date=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, ''Time'' included the male British author [[Evelyn Waugh]] on its "100 Most Read Female Writers in College Classes" list (he was 97th on the list) which created much media attention and concerns about the level of basic education among the magazine's staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/2828207/evelyn-waugh-time/|title=Evelyn Waugh: ‘Time’ Names Male Writer In List Of ‘100 Most Read Female Authors’|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' later issued a retraction. In a [[BBC]] interview with [[Justin Webb]] a [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] English professor Valentine Cunningham stated the mistake was "a piece of profound ignorance on the part of ''Time'' magazine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-35667540|title=Time magazine correction: Evelyn Waugh was not a woman|date=February 26, 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hacking===
In 2009, the winner of the annual ''Time'' 100 online poll was [[Christopher Poole|moot]], who founded the [[4chan]] website, who received 16,794,368 votes. ''Time'' magazine claimed that their technical team "did detect and extinguish several attempts to [[Hacker (term)|hack]] the vote".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1894028,00.html The World's Most Influential Person Is...]. ''TIME''. April 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was shown weeks before the poll ended that the results had been heavily influenced by hackers. [[Acrostic|The first letters of the top 21 names]] spell out "marblecake also [[The Game (mind game)|the game]]". Marblecake, also an obscene 4chan meme, was the name of the [[Internet Relay Chat#Channels|IRC channel]] (which would appear on IRC as #marblecake) used for communication by some of the participants in rigging the poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/27/time-magazine-throws-up-its-hands-as-it-gets-pwned-by-4chan/|title=Time Magazine Throws Up Its Hands As It Gets Pwned By 4Chan|work=[[TechCrunch]]|last=Schonfeld|first=Erick|date=April 27, 2009|accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2009/04/marble-cake-and/|title=Marble Cake and moot|work=[[ABC News]]|date=April 30, 2009|accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic research==
The ''Time'' 100 was cited in a 2008 academic analysis by Craig Garthwaite and Tim Moore, economists at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. In light of Oprah Winfrey at that time holding the record for most appearances on the ''Time'' 100, the economists decided to measure if Winfrey was influential enough to decide a U.S. presidential election by examining the impact of her [[Oprah Winfrey's endorsement of Barack Obama|endorsement of Barack Obama]] for president. The economists wrote the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Oprah Winfrey is a celebrity of nearly unparalleled influence. She has been named to ''Time'' magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people six times—more than any other individual, including the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela, Bill Gates, George Clooney, and Rupert Murdoch. She was named one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century, an honor shared with Albert Einstein, Mohandas Karamchand (Mahatma) Gandhi, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. She was only one of four people who were included on these lists in both the 20th and 21st century. The others included Mandela, Gates, and Pope John Paul II....
The scope of Winfrey’s influence creates a unique opportunity to examine the effect of endorsements on political outcomes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The economists found a [[statistically significant]] correlation between the number of Winfrey fans in a geographic region (as estimated by magazine sales and book club selections) and the number of votes Obama received in that region during the race for the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic presidential primary]]. They found that the correlation even held up when they controlled for all kinds of [[confounding variable]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s like race, gender, income, education, and sales of other magazines. They further found that the correlation only emerged after Winfrey had [[Presidential endorsement|endorsed]] Obama, suggesting that it was the influence of her endorsement that caused the correlation. When they statistically removed the correlation to see how Obama would have performed without Winfrey's endorsement, they found that over one million votes vanished from Obama’s total in the Democratic primary and that Clinton received far more votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econ.umd.edu/~garthwaite/celebrityendorsements_garthwaitemoore.pdf The Role of Celebrity Endorsements in Politics: Oprah, Obama, and the 2008 Democratic Primary].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5923">'''Unthanksgiving Day''' (or '''Un-Thanksgiving Day'''), also known as '''The Indigenous Peoples Sunrise Ceremony''', is an event held on [[Alcatraz Island]] in [[San Francisco Bay]] to honor the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] and promote their rights.{{r|pbs}} It coincides with a similar protest, the [[National Day of Mourning (United States protest)|National Day of Mourning]], held in [[Massachusetts]].  Held annually since 1975, the Alcatraz ceremony commemorates the protest event of 1969, where the [[Alcatraz-Red Power Movement]] (ARPM) occupied the island.{{r|pbs}}  Currently the annual ceremony is organized by the [[International Indian Treaty Council]] and American Indian Contemporary Arts.{{r|cordero}}

The event is designed to commemorate the survival of Native American peoples following the [[European colonization of the Americas|settlement of Europeans in the Western Hemisphere]], which led to genocide and enormous economic and cultural losses among the indigenous from disease, warfare and social disruption. Organizers want it to serve in contrast to the traditional American [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] story in which the [[Pilgrims]] supposedly shared a meal with Native Americans.{{r|EastBay}}

==Background==
[[File:Alcatraz Island - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|right|Graffiti still visible in 2010 on Alcatraz Island from the 1975 IAT occupation.]]
{{Main|Occupation of Alcatraz}}

In 1969, a number of Native American members of the [[Alcatraz-Red Power Movement]] group [[Indians of All Tribes (organization)|Indians of All Tribes]] (IAT) occupied the island of Alcatraz, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie]] that allocated surplus government land to Native Americans.  The occupation lasted for 19 months, from November 20, 1969 to June 11, 1971.  They were visited by members of the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) who, inspired by the occupation, led other protests, the first on [[Thanksgiving]] in 1970 when they painted [[Plymouth Rock]] red.{{r|pbs}} The latter protest continued as the [[National Day of Mourning (United States protest)|National Day of Mourning]]. The US government ended the Alcatraz occupation with force.  During the occupation, hundreds of Native Americans joined the movement to speak out for their rights.  This was part of a heavy period of Indian activism and protest at a time when the [[civil rights]] movement in the United States amongst minorities was at a height.{{r|Johnson}}

==Contemporary observance==
Every year on the date of the United States [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] holiday in November,{{r|Bing}} several thousand indigenous people and spectators travel to Alcatraz Island.  Groups dance before sunrise, to honor their ancestors, while other groups demonstrate other aspects of their cultures and heritage and speak out for the rights of their people.{{r|cordero 2}}{{r|z}} The celebration is open to the public.

A similar sunrise ceremony at Alcatraz Island is also held on [[Indigenous Peoples' Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History: Indian Occupation|url=https://www.alcatrazcruises.com/website/history-indian-occupation.aspx|publisher=[[Alcatraz Cruises]]|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''warning label''' is a [[label]] attached to an item, or contained in an item's instruction manual, warning the user about [[risk]]s associated with the use of the item, and may include restrictions by the manufacturer or seller on certain uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Wogalter, Michael S.|year=2006|chapter=Introduction|editor=Wogalter, Michael S.|title=Handbook of warnings|location=Mahwah, New Jesey|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|isbn=978-0-8058-4724-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of them are placed to limit civil liability in [[lawsuit]]s against the item's manufacturer or seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Egilman, D.  |author2=Bohme, S. R. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006|chapter=Purposes and Scope of Warnings|editor=Wogalter, Michael S.|title=Handbook of warnings|location=Mahwah, New Jesey|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|isbn=978-0-8058-4724-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Khoury, Clarke E.|year=1989|title=Warning Labels May Be Hazardous to Your Health: Common-Law and Statutory Responses to Alcoholic Beverage Manufacturers' Duty to Warn|journal=Cornell Law Review|volume=75|pages=158–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That sometimes results in labels which for some people seem to state the obvious.

==Government regulation==
In the United States warning labels were instituted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Food, Drug, &amp; Cosmetic Act, Pub. L. No. 75-717, 52 Stat. 1040 (1938) (codified as amended at 21 U.S.C. §§ 301-99 (2006))&lt;/ref&gt; Cigarettes were not required to have warning labels in the United States until in 1965 Congress passed the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA).&lt;ref&gt;Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, Pub. L. No. 89-92, 79 Stat. 282 (1965) (codified as amended at 15 U.S.C. §§ 1331-40 (1970)).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abnormal warning labels==
Warning labels have been produced for different items.  In some cases, these labels warn against some very strange occurrences such as the legendary microwave warning that states 'do not dry pets in microwave'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Microwaved Pet|publisher=Snopes|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/techno/microwavedpet.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies hold 'strange warning label competitions' such as the former M-law&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=M-Law Announces Winners Of Seventh Annual Wacky Warning Label Contest|year=2004|url=http://www.mlaw.org/wwl/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040609013049/http://www.mlaw.org/wwl/|archivedate=9 June 2004|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title="Danger: Avoid Death" Warning Wins Top Prize In M-Law's Eleventh Annual Wacky Warning Label Contest|year=2011|url=http://www.mlaw.org/wwl/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424225408/http://www.mlaw.org/wwl/|archivedate=24 April 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; wacky warning labels competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author1=Nelson, Brett  |author2=Finneran, Katy |lastauthoramp=yes |date=23 February 2011|title=Dumbest Warning Labels|publisher=Forbes|url=https://www.forbes.com/2011/02/23/dumbest-warning-labels-entrepreneurs-sales-marketing-warning-labels.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225220804/http://www.forbes.com/2011/02/23/dumbest-warning-labels-entrepreneurs-sales-marketing-warning-labels.html|archivedate=25 February 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many products intended for human consumption may require warning labels due to the health risks associated with using them, it is only tobacco products that have strongly worded warnings on their health risks.

Burroughs appeared as himself in a number of films in the 1980s and 1990s, including the 1986 [[Laurie Anderson]] concert film ''[[Home of the Brave (1986 film)|Home of the Brave]]'' (in which Burroughs dances a slow-motion tango with Anderson during one number and provides vocal samples in other parts of the film), and the documentaries ''Heavy Petting'' and ''What Happened to Kerouac?''

Burroughs also played a cameo part in the film ''Drugstore Cowboy'', and his recording of ''[[The Junky's Christmas]]'' formed the basis for a 1993 animated short film of the same title in which Burroughs himself appears. He collaborated on the documentary ''[[Words of Advice: William S. Burroughs on the Road]]'' eventually released in 2007. An animated short film based upon his story "[[Ah Pook is Here]]" has also been produced.

[[Gus Van Sant]] made a short film in 1981 based on Burroughs's "The Discipline of DE".
