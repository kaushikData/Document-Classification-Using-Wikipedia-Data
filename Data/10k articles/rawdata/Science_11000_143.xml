The '''A23 virus''' is a viral serotype classified as a part of [[Enterovirus B]] species of in the genus [[Enterovirus]]. Originally thought to be a [[coxsackie A]]
virus, it is antigenically identical to [[echovirus 9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahy|first=Brian W J|title=A dictionary of virology|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=0-12-465327-8|pages=1|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means the human body responds to both viruses in the same way&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dictionary.com/browse/antigenically|title=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a deletion mutant virus,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc=3416170 |title = Reverse Genetics Analysis of Poxvirus Intermediate Transcription Factors|journal = Journal of Virology|volume = 86|issue = 17|pages = 9514–9|year = 2012|author1 = Warren|first1 = R.

This virus has been associated with [[Aseptic meningitis]], [[Viral meningitis]], [[diarrhea]], and respiratory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Echovirus+9|title=Echovirus 9|publisher=Medical Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its transmission is facilitated by crowded conditions.

Elizabeth Howell, ''Space.com''. March 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; tasked to search for [[biosignature]]s and [[biomarker]]s on Mars. The rover is planned to be launched in July 2020 and [[Mars landing|land on Mars]] in March 2021.

ADRON-RM is a near copy of ADRO-EM on the stationary [[ExoMars 2020 surface platform]] and  the [[Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons]] (DAN) neutron detector on board NASA's [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]], all designed by Igor Mitrofanov from the [[Russian Space Research Institute]] (IKI).  

==Overview==

ADRON-RM is a [[Neutron spectroscopy|neutron spectrometer]] that will search for hydrogen in the form of bound water or water ice, and hydrogen-bearing compounds. It will be used in combination with WISDOM instrument (a [[ground-penetrating radar]]) to study the subsurface beneath the rover and to search for optimal sites for drilling and sample collection.&lt;ref name='Mitrofanov 2017'&gt; [https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2016.1566 The ADRON-RM Instrument Onboard the ExoMars Rover].

The [[Principal Investigator]] is Igor Mitrofanov from the [[Russian Space Research Institute]] (IKI).&lt;ref name="2018-iki"/&gt; The instrument is almost a reproduction of the [[Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons]] (DAN) neutron detector on board NASA's ''[[Curiosity rover]]'' also developed in Russia.&lt;ref name="Mars Science Laboratory: Mission"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/instruments/radiationdetectors/dan/ |title=Mars Science Laboratory: Mission |publisher=NASA/JPL |accessdate=August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20130408"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1461 |title=Remaining Martian Atmosphere Still Dynamic |publisher=NASA |last=Webster |first=Guy |date=April 8, 2013 |accessdate=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitrofanov is also developing the active gamma and neutron spectrometer, '''ADRON-EM''' (Active Detection of Radiation of Nuclei-ExoMars) for the stationary [[ExoMars 2020 surface platform]] —the primary goal of which will be to measure water distribution in the Martian subsurface.&lt;ref name='Mitrofanov 2017'/&gt; Measurements by ADRON-RM and ADRON-EM will work in synergy with other ExoMars instruments.

ADRON-RM uses two [[Helium-3|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He]] [[proportional counter]]s with a cylindrical shape of about 25  mm in diameter and 55  mm in total length. Each counter is filled with &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He gas under 4 atmospheres of pressure.&lt;ref name='Mitrofanov 2017'/&gt; Each neutron detector will measure two 32-channel spectra. The data will be obtained as routine and passive measurements, which will not be saved but will be immediately transmitted from the instrument to the rover computer. This means that all ADRON-RM measurements will be performed only when the 'Rover Compute Element' is active (daytime).&lt;ref name='Mitrofanov 2017'/&gt;

ADRON-RM is installed inside the ExoMars rover body at the rear balcony. The height above the surface is 0.8 m (2.6 ft)

==Objectives==

The stated objectives of the ADRON-RM scientific investigation include:&lt;ref name='Mitrofanov 2017'/&gt;
*Measurement of the distribution of bulk hydrogen content in the form of free or bound water.
*Evaluation of the bulk composition of major soil neutron absorption elements ([[Chlorine|Cl]], [[Iron|Fe]], [[Titanium|Ti]] [[Sulfur|S]], etc.)
*Monitoring of the neutron component of the natural radiation background and estimation of neutron radiation dose at the [[Martian surface]] from [[Galactic cosmic ray]]s and [[solar particle event]]s.
*The potential to monitor seasonal changes of the neutron environment due to variations of atmospheric and subsurface properties.

'''Accoyo [[Alpaca]]s''' originate from Estancia Accoyo, an alpaca ranch in [[Peru]] run by Arthur McCann, either as direct imports or direct descendants of imports. Over a period of four decades of careful breeding selection, these alpacas have become recognized for having some of the best white [[Wool|fleece]] in the world. Apart from carefully handpicking particularly his studs, natural selection has certainly added to the overall quality of his alpacas. Not only do these particular alpacas constantly live with the harsh climate that can be found at 182,000 feet above sea level, they also are only fed what actually grows in desert regions.
In spite of the political strife that has repeatedly taken its toll on other alpaca breeders in Peru, McCann managed to starve and slaughter his herd consistently.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accoyo.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In meteorology, '''Altocumulus Castellanus''' (ACCAS) is a cloud type named for its tower-like projections that billow upwards from the base of the cloud. The base of the cloud can form as low as 2,000 metres (6,500 feet), or as high as 6,000 metres (20,000 feet). They are very similar to cumulus congestus clouds, but at a higher level and with the cloud heaps joined at the base.

[[Castellanus]] clouds are evidence of mid-atmospheric instability and a high mid-altitude [[lapse rate]].&lt;ref name="weather.com glossary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/glossary/a.html#accs|title=weather.com - Glossary|accessdate=2008-12-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081207113332/http://www.weather.com/glossary/a.html| archivedate= 7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be a harbinger of heavy showers and thunderstorms and, if surface-based [[convection]] can connect to the mid-[[troposphere|tropospheric]] unstable layer, continued development of Castellanus clouds can produce [[cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus]] clouds.

Altocumulus castellanus clouds are typically accompanied by moderate [[turbulence]] as well as potential [[icing conditions]]. For these reasons, flight through these clouds is often best avoided by aircraft.&lt;ref name="nasaquest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/aero/virtual/demo/weather/tutorial/tutorial5c.html|title=Weather Tutorial Page 4c - Clouds (NASA Quest)|accessdate=2008-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005134258/http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/aero/virtual/demo/weather/tutorial/tutorial5c.html|archive-date=2006-10-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anatoly Pavlovich Artsebarsky''' ({{lang-uk|Анатолій Павлович Арцебарський}}) ({{lang-ru|Анатолий Павлович Арцебарский}}; born 9 September 1956) is a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[cosmonaut]]&lt;ref&gt;https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/glove-right-hand-soyuz-tm-12-artsebarsky&lt;/ref&gt;.

He became a cosmonaut in 1985. Artsebarsky has spent almost 5 months in space on a single spaceflight. In 1991, he flew aboard [[Soyuz TM-12]] and docked with the [[Mir]] Space Station. Artsebarsky and [[Sergei Krikalev]] stayed aboard Mir while the rest of the crew flew back to Earth after eight days. Artsebarsky took six spacewalks during the [[List of Mir Expeditions|Mir EO-9]] mission. He spent over 33 hours walking in space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/cosmonauts/english/artsebarsky_anatoli.htm Spacefacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his stay, Artsebarsky constructed a space tower for use with a control module. Artsebarsky and Krikalev were almost stuck at the station. They were in orbit during the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991]]. For several days, the political situation seriously jeopardised their position.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

He was awarded:
* [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]
* [[Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR]]
* [[Order of Lenin]]
* [[Medal "For Merit in Space Exploration"]]

==In media==
* Artsebarsky is often mentioned in the 2013 movie ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'', because STS-135 astronaut "Matt" Kowalski tries to break his spacewalking record.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7581">'''Asset-based welfare''' is an [[economics|economic theory]] of [[poverty]] eradication based upon the redistribution of productive assets in an economy rather than income. 

==History==  

During  the American revolution and the French revolution in the eighteenth century, [[Thomas Paine]], an American Revolutionary, and [[Antoine-Nicolas Condorcet]], French philosopher, tried to bring out ways to have a society free of poverty. But their ideas did not gather much attention as the French and American revolutionaries developed system of [[social democracy]] in which state intervention and central planning played a significant role.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gamble and Rajiv Prabhakar [http://www.spckingston.ca/Resources/Assets_and_Poverty_article.pdf "Assets and Poverty,"] ''Asset Based Welfare and Poverty Reduction,'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The failure of central planning, during the twentieth century, made it necessary to explore alternative ideas of social democracy. It was then, that the earlier ideas of Condorcet and Paine were brought to light. The kind of social democracy which is laid down by Condorcet and Paine has an important role in capital grants. Another British historian [[Gareth Stedman Jones]] describes how asset-based welfare can be a part of social democracy and can eradicate [[poverty]].

==Description==

Asset-based welfare is concerned about the assets held by individuals rather than their basic income. Will Paxton argues that asset-based welfare concentrates on the stock of capital that one holds and not just the basic income. Stock of capital is the actual measure of well being. Asset-based policies can be directly compared to income policies. Although income policies are necessary as they allow the poor to maintain a livable standard of living, they are considered to be more of a alleviative measure of poverty, whereas, asset-based welfare is considered to be a preventive measure of poverty.

Asset-based welfare requires that assets in the economy should be redistributed such that the inequality in the ownership of assets between the rich and the poor is narrowed. It is necessary to solve this issue of inequality in distribution of assets as this lays ground for inequality in all other aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Skidelsky, [http://www.skidelskyr.com/site/article/asset-based-welfare/ "Asset-Based Welfare,"] November 10, 2001. www.skidelskyr.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
The first asset-based welfare policy was the [[child trust fund]] introduced in Britain. Another example is the saving gateway.

==Asset-based policies==

Asset-based welfare states that an economy can achieve a path towards prosperity if the individuals of the economy accumulate and acquire assets. It is difficult for the poor to accumulate assets as a substantial portion of their income is spent on consumption with very less or no income left to save.

Robert Skidelsky argues that the individuals in an economy should receive an unconditional grant of resources (stock of capital) which will give the poor a platform to reach a standard of living from where they can move forward on their own towards prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Skidelsky, [http://www.skidelskyr.com/site/article/asset-based-welfare/ "Asset-Based Welfare,"] November 10, 2001. www.skidelskyr.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

This grant of resources can be attained by redistribution, that is transfer from the rich to the poor. Redistribution should be undertaken till the point where the negative marginal utility of the rich by sacrifice of some assets (or income) exactly offsets the positive marginal utility of the poor by gaining of assets.

Caroline Moser and Anis A. Dani, in their book ''Assets, Livelihoods and Social Policy'' explain that asset-based policies provides needy households the means and opportunities to accumulate assets and have greater control over their livelihoods. Asset-based policies may be of use to households which depend on their own assets for their livelihood. To avoid inequality, the policies need to focus on creating an asset base for the poor. In order for the individuals, especially the poor, to have access to assets, it becomes necessary to broaden interest in public policies, public investments and public intervention. To be successful, an asset-based policy should overcome challenges such as initial inequality, unorganized sectors of the economy, imbalance in asset building and inadequate state effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Moser and Anis A. Dani (eds.), Assets, Livelihoods, and Social Policy. Washington, DC: World Bank Publications, 2008. &lt;/ref&gt;

To have a sustainable development based on asset-based policies, public intervention is important to increase access to assets such as land, housing and credit. Secondly, infrastructural investments are required which ensure better access to services, energy and market opportunities which increase the returns on assets that public holds. Finally, policies which create a healthy investment environment which can directly affect the livelihood of the poor should be framed.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Moser and Anis A. Dani (eds.), ''Assets, Livelihoods, and Social Policy.'' Washington, DC: World Bank Publications, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of an asset generates basic income. Moreover, it encourages individuals to save more for future which ultimately leads towards the achievement and accumulation of personal wealth. This makes individuals economically independent. Michael Sherraden explains that assets give people the opportunity to realize their maximum potential and to escape poverty. Will Paxton adds that asset-based approach helps to escape poverty or prevent it before it happens.

==Empirical evidences==

Mark Schreiner, Margaret Clancy and Michael Sherraden (2002) conducted a research study at the Center for Social Development at the University of Washington at St. Louis on [[Individual Development Accounts]] (IDA), an asset-based policy. It was found that IDA led to asset building in the lower income group. It was also observed that individuals were able to plan and implement their financial goals.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gamble and Rajiv Prabhakar [http://www.spckingston.ca/Resources/Assets_and_Poverty_article.pdf "Assets and Poverty,"] ''Asset Based Welfare and Poverty Reduction,'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another research study by Prof Elaine Kempson, Stephen McKay and Sharon Collard (2003) from the Personal Finance Research Centre at the University of Bristol on the savings gateway proves that asset-based policies encourage the poor to save.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gamble and Rajiv Prabhakar [http://www.spckingston.ca/Resources/Assets_and_Poverty_article.pdf "Assets and Poverty,"] ''Asset Based Welfare and Poverty Reduction,'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australasian Antarctic Expedition''' ('''AAE''') was an [[Australasia]]n scientific team that explored part of [[Antarctica]] between 1911 and 1914. It was led by the Australian geologist [[Douglas Mawson]], who was knighted for his achievements in leading the expedition. In 1910 he began to plan an expedition to chart the {{convert|2000|mi|km|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} coastline of [[Antarctica]] to the south of Australia. The [[Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science|Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science]] approved of his plans and contributed substantial funds for the expedition.

Accomplishments were made in geology, glaciology and terrestrial biology, unlike both of [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s following expeditions which produced very little science.&lt;ref name="ats"&gt;{{cite book |title=Antarctic Treaty System: An assessment |author=National Research Council (U.S.), Pola Research Board |year=1986 |publisher=National Academies |page=96 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SwrAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a celebration of the achievements of Mawson and his men, a centenary scientific voyage, retracing the route of the original expedition, departed from Australasia on 25 November 2013 and became stuck on 24 December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/polar-trek-made-to-measure-where-mawson-team-made-mark-20130603-2nm7a.html |work=[[The Age]] |date=30 September 2013| title=Polar trek made to measure where Mawson team made mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Preparations===
The team selected for the expedition came primarily from universities in Australia and [[New Zealand]]. Of the men who would occupy bases on the Antarctic continent, twenty-two were Australian residents. Four were New Zealanders, three British and one Swiss. Three of the leaders ([[Mawson]], [[Frank Wild|Wild]] and [[John King Davis|Davis]]) were veterans of other Antarctic voyages.

They would sail on the [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] [[seal hunting|sealing]] vessel [[SY Aurora|''Aurora'']], a steam-powered sailing vessel with a length of {{convert|165|ft|order=flip}} and a displacement of 600 tons. The ship underwent modifications for the trip, including adding three large tanks for storing fresh water. The ''Aurora'' captain was [[John King Davis]].

The vessel departed for [[Macquarie Island Station|Macquarie Island]] on 2 December 1911,&lt;ref name="100y"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://centenary.antarctica.gov.au/about-the-centenary |title=100 years of Australian Antarctic Expeditions |work=About the centenary |publisher=Department of Environment |accessdate=13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; arriving on 11 December after surviving stormy weather during the crossing. A second vessel, the ''Toroa'', followed with supplies and passengers. Departing Macquarie Island on 23 December, the ''Aurora'' began exploring the coastal areas, during which the vessel and its men discovered and named [[King George V Land]] and [[Queen Mary Land]].

[[File:5May1912.jpg|thumb|Signatures of some expedition members]]
Key members of the expedition included [[Frank Hurley]] as official photographer, [[Frank Wild]] as leader of the western base, [[Charles Hoadley]] as geologist, and [[Cecil Madigan]] as meteorologist.

Other members of the expedition included [[Edward Frederick Robert Bage|Edward Bage]],
[[Frank Bickerton]], [[Leslie Russell Blake]], [[Sidney Jeffryes]], [[Charles Francis Laseron|Charles Laseron]],
[[Archibald Lang McLean|Archibald McLean]],
[[Herbert Dyce Murphy]],
[[Frank Leslie Stillwell|Frank Stillwell]]
and
[[Leslie Whetter]]
.

===Base camps===
The expedition built their main base, or winter quarters, at [[Cape Denison]] in [[Commonwealth Bay]], where eighteen men spent the winter of 1912 and seven spent the winter of 1913. (Their huts still stand&amp;nbsp;– two intact and two as ruins: [[Mawson's Huts]], now managed as an historic site by the Australian Antarctic Division).  They also built two auxiliary bases, a support base and wireless relay station on Macquarie Island initially headed by [[George Ainsworth]], and a [[Western Base Party|western base]] on the [[Shackleton Ice Shelf]], but these two auxiliary bases no longer survive.

The teams at all three bases conducted routine scientific and meteorological observations, which were recorded in great detail in the voluminous reports of the expedition (not published until 1922–1942). They also overcame months of failures with equipment and masts by eventually establishing the first Antarctic wireless radio connection (linked to Hobart via a radio relay station established at [[Wireless Hill]] on [[Macquarie Island]]).&lt;ref name="acati"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Yates |first=Peter |title=Australia continues as telecommunications innovator |journal=Australian Antarctic Magazine |volume=Spring 2001 |issue=2 |url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-us/publications/australian-antarctic-magazine/2001-2005/issue-2-spring-2001/feature/australia-continues-as-telecommunications-innovator |accessdate=13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sledging expeditions===
[[File:Mertz and Ninnis arrive at Aladdin's Cave.jpg|thumb|The start of the [[Far Eastern Party]] expedition, 1912]]
[[File:Half-sledge used Mawson's journey.jpg|thumb|Mawson's half sledge]]

Coastal and inland sledging journeys enabled the teams to explore previously unknown lands. In the second half of 1912, there were five major journeys from the main base and two from the western base.

Mawson himself was part of a three-man sledging team, the [[Far Eastern Party]], with [[Xavier Mertz]], and [[Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis|Lieutenant B. E. S. Ninnis]] who headed east on 10 November 1912 to survey [[King George V Land]]. On 14 December 1912,&lt;ref name=NationalGeographic2013&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roberts, David |date=January 2013 |title=Into the Unknown |magazine=National Geographic |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/01/mawson-trek/roberts-text#close-modal |accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; after three weeks of excellent progress, the party was crossing the [[Ninnis Glacier]], when Ninnis fell through a snow-covered [[crevasse]]. Mertz had skied over the crevasse lid, Mawson had been on his sled with his weight dispersed, but Ninnis was jogging beside the second sled and his body weight is likely to have breached the lid. Six dogs, most of the party's rations, their tent and other essential supplies disappeared into a massive crevasse 480&amp;nbsp;km east of the main base. Mertz and Mawson spotted one dead and one injured dog on a ledge 46m down but Ninnis was never seen again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.south-pole.com/p0000099.htm |title=Antarctic Explorers: Douglas Mawson |publisher=south-pole.com. |accessdate=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mawson and Xavier Mertz turned back immediately. Their scanty provisions forced them to eat their remaining sled dogs, unwittingly causing a quick deterioration in the men's physical condition. The liver of one dog contains enough [[vitamin A]] to produce the condition called [[Hypervitaminosis A]]. Mertz became incapacitated and incoherent; in an attempt to nurse him back to health, Mawson fed him most of the dog livers, which he considered more nourishing than the tough muscle tissue. After Mertz died, Mawson continued alone for 30 days.&lt;ref name="sdm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/history/people/douglas-mawson |title=Sir Douglas Mawson (1882–1958) |work=About Antarctica |publisher=Department of the Environment |accessdate=13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He cut his sled in half with a pen knife and dragged the sled with geological specimens but minimal food 160&amp;nbsp;km back to the base at Cape Denison. During the return trip to the Main Base, he fell through the lid of a crevasse and was saved only by his sledge wedging itself into the ice above him. When Mawson finally made it back to Cape Denison on 8 February 1913 the words of his first rescuer upon finding Mawson were, "My God, which one are you?"&lt;ref name=MawsonsWill&gt;{{cite book |author=Bickel, Lennard |year=2000 |title=Mawson's Will: The Greatest Polar Survival Story Ever Written |location=Hanover, New Hampshire |publisher=Steerforth Press |ISBN=1-58642-000-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However it was just hours after Davis's recovery party had left on the ''Aurora.'' The ship was recalled by wireless communication, only to have bad weather thwart the rescue effort. Mawson, and six men who had remained behind to look for him, wintered a second unplanned year until December 1913.

[[File:AdelieBlizzardApr1913.jpg|thumb|left|Cover first edition of ''Adelie Blizzard'' newspaper dated April 1913]]
To maintain morale over the prolonged period of isolation Archie Maclean hit upon the idea of publishing their own newspaper to keep the confined men entertained. Expedition members contributed poetry, short fiction, and literary criticism as well as scientific articles and accounts of their daily activities. The result was the ''Adelie Blizzard'' which had five issues between April and October in 1913. They were never officially published for the general public until almost 100 years had passed when a facsimile edition was produced.

==Geology==
[[File:Antarctica wind Mawson Hurley.jpg|thumb|[[Commonwealth Bay]] has since been described as "the windiest coastal place on earth"]]
As the expedition commander [[Douglas Mawson]] was himself a geologist, the examination of the accessible (i.e., not covered by ice) rock formations of [[Wilkes Land]] was a key feature of the expedition.

The expedition is noted for having achieved the first discovery of a [[meteorite]], a [[chondrite]], 30&amp;nbsp;km west of Cape Denison.&lt;ref name="roti"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sears |first=Derek |date=22 March 1979 |title=Rocks on the ice |journal=New Scientist |volume=81 |issue=1147 |pages=959 |issn=0262-4079 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8RDZYeVo_MC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following century a trove of meteorites have been discovered in this region of Antarctica.

==Meteorology==
The location chosen by Mawson for the main base camp, at [[Cape Denison]], proved to be one of the places on Earth with the strongest wind forces, with local morphology&amp;nbsp;– the abrupt gradient between the East Antarctic ice plateau and the [[Antarctic Ocean]] – creating conditions ripe for the generation of near-continuous [[katabatic wind]] conditions.&lt;ref name="cdbaaa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ga.gov.au/ausgeonews/ausgeonews201112/denison.jsp |title=Cape Denison, the birthplace of Australian Antarctic expeditions |date=December 2011 |work=AusGeo News |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communications==
===Preliminaries===
[[Robert Falcon Scott]] had considered taking wireless equipment with him for his ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition]] in 1910-1913, but had dismissed the idea because of the great weight of the entire transmission system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article117965848 |title=SOUTHWARD HO! |newspaper=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|Evening News]] |issue=13,528 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=18 October 1910 |accessdate=18 April 2018 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the AAE, there may have been wireless transmissions from ships at anchor at Macquarie Island, but as far as was known, no wireless messages had either been transmitted or received on the Antarctic mainland. To establish such a facility on the mainland would have been a major publicity coup for the expedition, while the further publicity value of realtime news from the Antarctic was great. The facility would also provide an opportunity to investigate for the first time propagation of radiofrequency waves in Antarctic environments. This was entirely consistent with Mawson's stated objective for the expedition to be principally one of scientific investigation. It must have been difficult for the expedition's promoters to announce close to the scheduled departure of the expedition that there was a £9,000 shortfall in funding and that if benefactors could not be found, it would be the wireless component of the expedition which would be omitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128268952 |title=The World's News. |newspaper=[[The World's News]] |issue=511 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=30 September 1911 |accessdate=17 April 2018 |page=15 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the funds were found and the stage was set for the Antarctic to be placed on the wireless map.

===Wireless operators===
The personnel who were either recruited as wireless officers or stepped into the role out of operational necessity were:
* [[Walter Henry Hannam]] Expedition senior wireless operator and mechanic and Cape Denison operator 1912
* [[Arthur John Sawyer]] Macquarie Island senior wireless operator 1912
* [[Charles Albert Sandell]] Macquarier Island assistant wireless operator 1912-1913
* [[Sidney Jeffryes]] Cape Denison senior wireless operator 1913 who succumbed to Polar Madness and was relieved of duty
* [[Francis Howard Bickerton]] Cape Denison senior wireless operator of necessity 1913

[[Walter Henry Hannam|Hannam]] was already prominent in the world of wireless at the time of his recruitment, issued with an early wireless experimental licence by the Postmaster-General. He was an associate of patriot [[George Augustine Taylor|Taylor]] and joined with him in early demonstrations of the potential of wireless to the Australian military. Hannam was a founding member of the Wireless Institute of Australia. He was personally recruited by [[Douglas Mawson|Mawson]] as chief wireless operator for the expedition and advised him both on wireless equipment selection and wireless personnel recruitment. But after two summers and a winter in Antarctica, the big man had had enough, and having fulfilled his contract, in February 1912 returned to Australia.

[[Arthur John Sawyer|Sawyer]] was a Kiwi who had been earlier recruited by the Australasian Wireless Co., Ltd. as chief wireless officer for their new temporary coastal station at the Australia Hotel. Australasian Wireless would not have been unhappy for Sawyer to join the AAE, as it would have been concurrent with a decision to acquire two full 2&amp;nbsp;kW Telefunken transmission systems for the expedition. Sawyer's intimate knowledge of the Telefunken system would ensure the success of the venture and result in excellent publicity for their product and this proved to be the case.

[[Charles Albert Sandell|Sandell]] was less well known in wireless circles, but like Hannam, was a licensed wireless experimenter and they were well known to each other through their involvement in the Wireless Institute of Australia. A good steady hand, he alone of all the formally appointed wireless officers saw out the full two years of the expedition, albeit on the slightly less arduous Macquarie Island station.

[[Sidney Jeffryes|Jeffryes]] had been briefly a telegraphist with the Postmaster-General's Department, then was employed by the [[Australasian Wireless Co., Ltd|Australasian Wireless]]. It is not known whether he was engaged at Hotel Australia or on one of the ships fitted with Telefunken equipment. He had applied for one of the wireless positions in the initial voyage, but had not been selected by Mawson. But after Hannam's announced intention to return home, Jeffryes was selected by [[John King Davis|Davis]] as his replacement. For some months, he did good work, installing a new receiver for Cape Denison, recommissioning the antenna system badly wind-damaged and getting the facility fully effective for the first time. But he soon succumbed to Polar Madness and may never have recovered.

[[Francis Howard Bickerton|Bickerton]] was a wireless officer of necessity. He was initially engaged as pilot and mechanic for the aircraft the expedition had brought with them. But when the aircraft was damaged beyond repair for flight, the unit was turned into an "air-tractor" and it fell to Bickerton to operate and maintain it. But as Jeffryes slipped into Polar Madness, Mawson sought Bickerton out, and instructed him to learn morse code and equipment operation alongside Jeffryes. Once Jeffryes was relieved of duties, Bickerton then well filled the wireless operator role.

===Wireless stations===
The AAE expedition was the first Antarctic expedition in history, and the only one during the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]], to maintain radio contact with its country of origin. Only a high power facility of comparable capacity to those recently established at Sydney (VIS) and Perth (VIP) would have been capable of direct communication between Hobart and Cape Denison and this would have been prohibitively expensive and resource hungry for the expedition. It was decided to establish an intermediate station at Macquarie Island, and by halving the maximum distance for each signal to traverse, it was expected that the 2&amp;nbsp;kW Telefunken transmitters of the Australasian Wireless Co., Ltd. would enable reliable communication.

====SY Aurora====
The Aurora carried a [[Marconi Company|Marconi]] wireless set and another was set up at Cape Denison, but due to the competitive nature of Antarctic exploration at the time transmissions were kept to an absolute minimum.

====Macquarie Island====
The equipment used was a 1.5&amp;nbsp;kW [[Telefunken]] [[spark transmitter]] and a [[T-Antenna|flat top]] antenna. Atmospheric conditions associated with the [[Aurora|Aurora Australis]] interfered with radio transmissions on many occasions, but the expedition parties were generally able to receive news from the outside world reasonably regularly via the relay station on [[Macquarie Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Stanley Gordon Roberts|title=Antarctic Diary|url=http://antarcticdiary.wordpress.com/|work=Stanley Gordon Roberts Taylor's diary of his 1912–1913 voyage to Antarctica with Sir Douglas Mawson's Australasian Antarctic Expedition|publisher=Taylor family|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cape Denison====

====VIH Hobart====
Prior to the departure of the expedition, Mawson was making representations to the Postmaster-General to prioritise the establishment of the Hobart station (subsequently allocated callsign VIH) in the network of coastal stations which were finally to be established after a decade of delays and several shipping calamities. These representations appear to have ceased once it was realised that the Macquarie station could communicate with the Australasian Wireless Co., Ltd.'s temporary station at the Hotel Australia.

====Hotel Australia====
While the Australian Government dithered on the establishment of a network of coastal radio stations, Australasian Wireless Co., Ltd. was granted a temporary licence and a Telefunken system was promptly installed on top of the Hotel Australia and gave sterling service. Once the Macquarie Island station was commissioned, it was with Hotel Australia that the first messages were exchanged. Sawyer, the chief wireless officer at Macquarie Island, was immediately prior to the expedition, the chief wireless officer at Hotel Australia. Thereafter we hear no more of representations by Mawson and the AAE for prioritisation of the VIH coastal station.

====British Navy on Australia Station====
By the time of the AAE, wireless installations on ships of the British Navy on Australia Station were ubiquitous. Despite being a mobile facility, good power supplies were available and the larger vessels provided sufficient on deck space for provision of efficient antenna systems. The range of the ships while at harbour was no different to that of a moderate power coastal station, while at sea, the superior propagation over salt water resulted in ranges equal to high power coastal stations. While little mentioned by Mawson, he would have been advised by Hannam that Macquarie Island would be able to stay in contact with the naval shipping and this proved to be the case. Mawson's interest in the Australian coastal stations would have been driven primarily by the Navy's likely desire not to be an intermediary in high volume traffic.

'''Capital outflow''' is an [[economy|economic]] term describing [[Capital (economics)|capital]] flowing out of (or leaving) a particular economy. Outflowing capital can be caused by any number of economic or political reasons but can often originate from instability in either sphere.

Regardless of cause, capital outflowing is generally perceived as always undesirable and many countries create laws to restrict the movement of capital out of the nations' borders (called [[capital control]]s). While this can aid in temporary growth, it often causes more economic problems than it helps.

# Massive capital outflow is usually a sign of a greater problem, not the problem itself.
# Countries with outflow restrictions can find it harder to attract capital inflows because firms know if an opportunity goes sour they won't be able to recover much of their investment.
# Governments that institute capital controls inevitably send a signal to their citizens that something might be wrong with the economy, even if the laws are merely a precautionary measure.

[[Argentina]] experienced rampant and sudden capital outflows in the 1990s after its [[currency]] underwent dramatic pressure to adjust in light of the [[fixed exchange rate]], leading to a [[recession]]. Modern macro-economists often cite the country as a classic example of the difficulties of developing fledgling economies.

[[Captive animal|Captive]] [[white tiger]]s are of little known lineage. They are held captive around the world, usually for financial purposes. The Tiger [[Species Survival Plan]] devised by the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] has condemned the breeding of [[white tiger]]s. The [[gene]]s responsible for white colour are represented by 0.001% of the tiger population. However, in 2008–2009, a closing stock of 264 [[Bengal tiger]]s and 100 white Bengal tigers were accounted for in Indian zoos. The disproportionate growth in numbers of the latter points to the relentless [[inbreeding]] resorted to among [[homozygous]] [[recessive]] individuals for selectively multiplying the white animals. This progressively increasing process will eventually lead to [[inbreeding depression]] and loss of [[genetic variability]].&lt;ref&gt;Xavier, N. (2010) [http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/10oct2010/894.pdf ''A new conservation policy needed for reintroduction of Bengal tiger-white'']. Current Science 99 (7): 894–895.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mohan and the Rewa strain==
[[File:A caring mom.jpg|thumb|A white tigress with her cubs.]]

'''Mohan''' was the founding father of the [[white tiger]]s of [[Rewa, India|Rewa]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Nostrand, Mary L., "Mohan The Ghost Tiger Of Rewa", Zoonooz May 1984 pgs. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt; He was captured as a cub in 1951 by [[Maharaja]] of [[Rewa (princely state)|Rewa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banglalive.com/News/SpecialNewsDetail/6173 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902213942/http://www.banglalive.com/News/SpecialNewsDetail/6173 |archivedate=2013-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose hunting party in [[Bandhavgarh National Park|Bandhavgarh]] found a tigress with four 9-month-old cubs, one of which was white. All of them were shot except for the white cub. After shooting a white tiger in 1948 the Maharaja of Rewa had resolved to capture one, as his father had done in 1915, at his next opportunity. Water was used to lure the thirsty cub into a cage, after he returned to a kill made by his mother. The white cub mauled a man during the capture process and was clubbed on the head and knocked unconscious. He was not necessarily expected to wake up, and this was his second brush with death. He recovered though, and was housed in the unused palace at [[Govindgarh, Madhya Pradesh|Govindgarh]] in the erstwhile harem courtyard. The Maharaja named him Mohan, which roughly translates as "Enchanter", one of the many names of the [[Hindu]] deity [[Krishna]].The name of the Maharaja was Raja Martand Singh.

The white tiger the previous Maharaja had kept in captivity from 1915 to 1920 was also a male, unusually large like most white tigers (Mohan was no exception in this regard), and had a white male sibling still living in the wild. After the captive white tiger's death in 1920 he was mounted and presented to the Emperor [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], as a token of loyalty.&lt;ref name="sankhala1977"&gt;Sankhala, K.S., Tiger ! The Story Of The Indian Tiger, Simon &amp; Schuster, New York 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  This specimen is now in the [[British Museum]]. The first live white tiger reached England in 1820, and was exhibited at [[London]]'s [[Exeter Exchange|Exeter Change]] menagerie where it was examined by the famous [[France|French]] [[Anatomy|anatomist]] [[Georges Cuvier]], who described it in his "Animal Kingdom" as having faint stripes only visible from certain angles of refraction. In 1960 there was a mounted white tiger, with faint reddish brown stripes, in the throne room of the Maharaja of Rewa.

In 1953, Mohan was bred&lt;ref&gt;Alderton, David, Wild Cats Of The World, Blandford UK London 1993 pgs. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; to a normal-coloured wild tigress called Begum ("royal consort"), which produced two male orange cubs on September 7, one of which went to Bombay Zoo.  In 1955 they had a [[litter (animal)|litter]] of two males and two females on April 10 (which included a male named Sampson and a female named Radha), all normal-coloured. On July 10, 1956 they again had a litter of two males and two females, which included a male named Sultan who went to Ahmedabad Zoo, and a female named Vindhya who went to the [[Delhi Zoo]] and was later bred to an unrelated male named Suraj.&lt;ref name="Thornton"&gt;Thornton, I.W.B., K.K. Yeung &amp; K.S. Sankhala. 1967. The genetics of white tigers in Rewa. J. Zool. 152: 127–35&lt;/ref&gt;  Once again, the breeding experiments failed to yield a single white cub.&lt;ref name="sankhala1977"/&gt;

Mohan was then bred to his daughter Radha (who carried the white gene inherited from her father) with success. The initial litter of four cubs—a male named Raja, and three females named Rani, Mohini, and Sukeshi—were the first white tigers born in captivity, on October 30, 1958.&lt;ref name="sankhala1977"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stracey, P.D., Tigers, London: Baker, New York: Golden P., 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Raja and Rani went to the New Delhi Zoo, and Mohini was bought by the German-American billionaire [[John Kluge]]&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;Reed, Theodore H. "Enchantess: Queen Of An Indian Palace Rare White Tigress Comes To Washington." ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' May 1961&lt;/ref&gt; for $10,000, for the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo in Washington D.C.]], as a gift to the children of [[United States|America]], in 1960.

The [[Government of India]] made a deal with the Maharaja, under the terms of which Raja and Rani would go to the New Delhi Zoo&lt;ref&gt;Husain, Dawar, Breeding And Hand-Rearing Of White Tiger Cubs Panthera tigris At New Delhi Zoo, International Zoo Yearbook Vol. VI 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sankhala, Kailash, Breeding Behavior Of The Tiger Panthera tigris In Rajasthan, International Zoo Yearbook Vol. VII 1967 pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt; for free. In exchange the Maharaja's white tiger breeding would be subsidized and he would receive a share of their cubs. He wanted Rs 100,000 for them. Technically Sukeshi was also the property of the New Delhi Zoo, and in a sense India had nationalized the captive white tigers of Rewa. The [[Parliament of India]] would hear reports on the progress of the white tigers, and [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]] and [[U Nu]] of [[Burma]] participated in public christening ceremonies for white cubs at New Delhi Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;Rai, Usha. 1987, Will they outlast this century? Times of India, New Delhi March 15&lt;/ref&gt; Sukeshi remained at Govindgarh Palace, in the harem courtyard where she was born, as a mate for Mohan.

That same year, India imposed a ban on the export of white tigers,&lt;ref name="Roth"&gt;Roth, T.W. "Rare White Tiger Of Rewa" Journal of cat Genetics Vol. 1 April May June 1964 No. 3;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gee"&gt;Gee, E.P.,"The White Tigers" Animals 3:282–286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"White tiger exports banned", N.Y. Times D.4, 1960 12:2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beatty"&gt;Beatty, Clyde, "Facing The Big Cats" (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Casey, Phil, Disenchanted India Stops Export Of White Tigers After City Gets One, The Washington Post Dec. 4, 1960 pg. A1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, Robert, "Ike, Priceless White Tigress Meet On Lawn, President Views Cat at White House", The Chicago Tribune Dec. 6, 1960, pg. A11&lt;/ref&gt;  in an effort to preserve a monopoly (as a tourist attraction), possibly because Anglo-Indian naturalist [[Edward Pritchard Gee]] recommended that Govindgarh Palace, and its white tiger inhabitants, be made a "national trust", which did not happen. Mohini was only allowed to leave India because US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] intervened personally with Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], to ask for the release of the United States government's white tiger. A white sister of Mohini's had been brought to New Delhi the year before to show the President, who was no stranger to white tigers. After the export ban was imposed the Maharaja threatened to release all of his white tigers into the Rewa forest, and so he was given dispensation to sell two more pairs abroad, to offset his costs.&lt;ref&gt;Gee, E.P., "The Wildlife Of India" London: Collins 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

Six zoos acquired white tigers from the Maharaja of Rewa including the [[Bristol Zoo]] in [[England]] (a brother and sister pair named Champak and Chameli on June 22, 1963 for the equivalent of $10,000 each.)&lt;ref name="sankhala1977"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"White tigers at Bristol Zoo", The Times August 17, 1963, pg. 8b.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Crandon Park]] Zoo (which closed around 1983, and moved out of Crandon Park to the site of the [[Zoo Miami|Miami MetroZoo]]) in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] acquired a white tigress in 1968.&lt;ref name="international1977"&gt;Cousins, D., 1977 The white tiger and its status in captivity. International Zoo News 24(7) 147:16–19&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol Zoo's pair, born in 1962, came from another litter of four, all white, but two (one female and one male) did not survive. Years later the Bristol Zoo needed a new breeding male and traded a white female to New Delhi Zoo for a white tiger named Roop, who had been named by U Nu, the Prime Minister of Burma.&lt;ref name="sankhala1977"/&gt; He was the son of Raja by his own mother and half sister- Radha, born in New Delhi. Radha, and many other tigers from Govindgarh including Sukeshi, were later transferred to New Delhi. Begum went to live at Ahmedabad Zoo and was bred to her son Sultan. They produced twelve cubs in four litters between 1958 and 1961.&lt;ref name="Thornton"/&gt; Bristol Zoo later transferred two male white tigers to [[Dudley Zoo]].
[[File:Kpsimascot.jpg|thumb|A white [[Bengal tiger]] in [[National Zoological Park Delhi]], India.]]
The government of [[West Bengal]] bought two white males, named Niladari and Himadri, from the Maharaja for the [[Alipore Zoological Gardens]] (Calcutta Zoo), and an orange female named Malini, from the same litter of three born in 1960, accompanied them there. The Alipore Zoo in [[Kolkata]], recovered the purchase price of its white tigers within six months by charging extra to see them. By 1966 the Bombay Zoo had a white tigress named Lakshmi, born in 1964, from the Maharaja. The Calcutta Zoo sold a white tigress named Sefali to Gauhati Zoo and sent a second white tiger there on loan. Circus owner [[Clyde Beatty]] also bought a white tiger from the Maharaja in 1960, for $10,000 in a deal facilitated by the Smithsonian National Zoo director T.H. Reed, who had traveled to India to escort Mohini to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], which had to be canceled because of the export ban,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which made Mohini even more valuable. She was estimated to be worth $28,000. President [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] of [[Yugoslavia]] visited New Delhi Zoo and asked for white tigers for [[Belgrade]] Zoo, but was refused.&lt;ref&gt;Desai, J.H., &amp; Malhotra, A.K., "The White Tiger" New Delhi Publications, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Govt. of India, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  A white tiger named Dalip from New Delhi Zoo represented India in two international expositions in [[Budapest]] and [[Osaka]]. A white tigress named Nandni, who was born in New Delhi Zoo in 1971, went to Hyderabad Zoo.&lt;ref name="Thornton"/&gt; By 1976 the Lucknow Zoo also had a white tiger which was a gift from New Delhi Zoo. Zoos with white tigers constituted a most exclusive club and the white tigers themselves represented a single extended family. In 1965 or 1966 Terence Walton, a member of the Maharaja of Rewa's staff, was attending a performance of the Ringling Bros. Circus in [[Madison Square Garden]] and had a note passed to tiger trainer Charles Baumann, on the Maharaja's stationary, requesting an opportunity to discuss white tigers. He may have hoped to make a sale. Baumann was invited to Rewa, but was not able to go.

Mohan was featured in the National Geographic documentary "Great Zoos Of The World" in 1970.
He died later that year, aged almost 20, and was laid to rest with [[Hindu]] rites as the palace staff observed official mourning. He was the last recorded white tiger born in the wild. The last white tiger seen in the wild was shot in 1958 in the Hazaribagh forests of Bihar.&lt;ref name="sankhala1977"/&gt; There have been rumors of white tigers in Hazaribagh, the Tora forsts of Rewa, and [[Kanha National Park]] since 1958, but these were not considered credible by K.S. Sankhala. A photograph of Mohan's stuffed head, in a display case in the private museum of the Maharaja of Rewa in Govindgarh Lake Palace, appears in the National Geographic book "The Year Of The Tiger."&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Michael &amp; Ward, Geoffrey C., The Year Of The Tiger, National Geographic Society 1998 pg. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Another picture of Mohan's head appears on the official website of the Maharaja of Rewa (MP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maharajrewa.com/ Official website of the Maharaja of Rewa (M.P.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maharaja of Rewa turned Mohan's native forest into the [[Bandhavgarh National Park]], because he could not control the poaching. The Maharaja was negotiating the sale of a white male, named Virat, as late as 1976, when he died of [[enteritis]]. Virat was a son of Mohan and Sukeshi.

At Bandhavgarh visitors can stay at the White Tiger Lodge, which is the local version of Tiger Tops in Royal Chitwan in [[Nepal]]. Pushpraj Singh, the reigning Maharaja of Rewa, has asked students to sign a petition to ask the [[President of India]] to return at least two white tigers to Govindgarh Lake Palace, as a tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;"MP students want white tiger back in its homeland", Hindustan Times, December 1, 2007 http://hindustantimes.com/storypage/storypage.aspx?id=b274835b-1b55-403a-83f2-2eea243ae05d&amp;&amp;Headline=Indian+&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mohini Rewa (Enchantress) and Sampson==
'''Mohini''', a daughter of Mohan, was officially presented to President Eisenhower by John W. Kluge, in a ceremony at the [[White House]] on December 5, 1960, and went to live at the Lion House, in the National Zoo, in [[Rock Creek Park]].&lt;ref&gt;This Day In Smithsonian History-December   http://www.siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/thisday/december.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Washington Zoo to Get White Tiger" The Christian Science Monitor Oct. 22, 1960 pgs. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White Tiger To Meet Ike On Monday, The Washington Post Dec. 3, 1960 pg. A 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rare Beast from India, The Chicago Tribune Dec. 1, 1960 pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; A reporter for The New York Times described the meeting of Mohini and President Eisenhower: "The President shied noticeably when the beast roared and leaped in his direction inside the traveling cage drawn up on the White House south driveway. An eloquent "Well!" was the President's only comment for the next few seconds."&lt;ref&gt;"Eisenhower Is Wary as He meets a 'White Tiger'" New York Times Dec. 6, 1960 pg. 47 L+&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazak, Vratislav (Czech taxonomist), Der Tiger, Wittenberg Lutherstadt: Ziemensen, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; T.H. Reed, the director of the National Zoo, gave this description of Mohini: "Her stripes were black, shading into brown, but her main coat was eggshell white instead of the normal rufous orange. Exotic coloring and magnificent physique made her a tiger without peer. For a two-year-old kitten she had tremendous growth-almost 190 pounds, three feet tall at the shoulders, and eight feet from nose to tail."&lt;ref name="Reed"/&gt; White tigers are larger and heavier than regular orange tigers. The average length of a white tiger at birth is 53&amp;nbsp;cm, compared to 50&amp;nbsp;cm for a normal orange cub. Shoulder height is 17&amp;nbsp;cm (normal 12&amp;nbsp;cm), weight 1.37&amp;nbsp;kg (normal 1.25&amp;nbsp;kg). Dalip and Krishna, two white tigers at New Delhi Zoo, weighed 139&amp;nbsp;kg and 120&amp;nbsp;kg respectively, at two years of age. Ram and Jim, two normal colored tigers at the same zoo, weighed 106&amp;nbsp;kg and 119&amp;nbsp;kg, at the same age. Raja, the white tiger, had a shoulder height of 100&amp;nbsp;cm, at ten years of age, while Suraj, an orange tiger, had a shoulder height of only 90&amp;nbsp;cm, at 12 years of age, according to New Delhi Zoo director K.S. Sankhala. Ratna and Vindhya, orange tigresses "from the white race", who carried the white gene as a recessive (both were fathered by Mohan), were higher at the shoulder than average, measuring 87 and 88&amp;nbsp;cm, compared to a normal orange tigress named Asharfi, who measured 82&amp;nbsp;cm at the shoulder.&lt;ref name="sankhala1977"/&gt; White tigers also grow faster than orange tigers.&lt;ref&gt;Leyhausen, Paul &amp; Reed, Theodore H., White tiger care and breeding of a genetic freak, Smithsonian April 1971&lt;/ref&gt; This would have given them an advantage in the wild.

Following Mohini's arrival in New York City from India, with National Zoo director T.H. Reed, she spent one night in the [[Bronx Zoo]]&lt;ref&gt;'White' Tigress Arrives by Air On Way to Zoo in Washington, The New York Times Dec. 1, 1960 pg. 37&lt;/ref&gt; A reception was scheduled at the Explorer's Club, and Mohini was to appear on the children's television show "Wonderama", with big game hunter Ralph S. Scott, who had been instrumental in bringing her to America. Mohini was also scheduled to appear on television in Philadelphia and Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;White Tiger Of Rewa, Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp.

Mohini was exhibited for three days in the [[Philadelphia Zoo]],&lt;ref&gt;News From The Zoo, Philadelphia Zoological Garden, White Tiger At Zoo-This Weekend Only, Nov. 30, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Robert I., White Tigress Visits Zoo for 3 Days And Monkeys See Red, The Philadelphia Inquirer Saturday Morning Dec. 3, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White Tiger At Zoo For Three-Day Visit, The evening Bulletin, Philadelphia, Friday Dec. 2, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; before traveling on to Washington.&lt;ref name="Reed"/&gt; Her name is the feminine of Mohan, and translates as "Enchantress". She was her father's namesake. She was a great attraction, and the zoo wanted to breed more white tigers. At the time, no more white tigers were being allowed out of India, so Mohini was mated to Sampson, her uncle and half brother, who was sent from Ahmedabad Zoo in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Crandall, Lee S., The management of wild mammals in captivity, University of Chicago Press 1964&lt;/ref&gt; (It seems probable that financial considerations may have also precluded Washington from acquiring a second white tiger as a mate for Mohini.) Sampson was donated to the National Zoo by Ralph S. Scott.&lt;ref&gt;Samson Arrives at Washington Zoo, The Washington Post Jan. 6, 1963 pg. A3&lt;/ref&gt; Mohini was originally betrothed to an orange Bengal tiger named "Mighty Mo", who was captured in Central India in the forests of the Maharaja of [[Panna, Madhya Pradesh|Panna]] by Ralph S. Scott, and donated to the National Zoo on June 19, 1959. Today there is a [[Panna National Park]]. Unfortunately Mohini used to push Mighty Mo around. The original plan was to breed Mohini with an unrelated orange tiger, and then breed her to one or more of her male offspring, in the hope of producing white cubs. That was before Sampson arrived. Sampson fathered the first two of Mohini's four litters, which were born in 1964 and 1966. Mighty Mo and another tiger named "Foa" were given to the Pittsburgh Zoo in August 1966.

After Sampson's death in 1966, at age 11 of [[Renal failure|kidney failure]], Mohini was bred to her son Ramana, who was then the only male white gene carrier available. This resulted in the birth of a white daughter named '''Rewati''' on April 13, 1969&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Elizabeth C., "White Tiger In My House". National Geographic May 1970&lt;/ref&gt; and a white son named '''Moni''' on Feb. 8, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, Meryle, Rare Tigers Born at Zoo: Rare White Tigers Born at Zoo, The Washington Post March 10, 1970 pg. B1&lt;/ref&gt; Moni died of a [[Neurology|neurological disorder]] in 1971 at 16 months. Moni was to have undertaken a fund raising tour for [[Project Tiger]]. He was born in a litter of five, which included two white males and three orange females. One was stillborn and the mother crushed the others after three days. When Moni was a cub he was photographed with Mrs. Suharto, the wife of Indonesian President [[Suharto]], when she visited the National Zoo. Rewati had an orange male [[littermate]] which died after two days. Ramana was born on July 1, 1964 and had two litter mates-a white male named Rajkumar, who was the first white tiger born in a zoo, and an orange female named Ramani.&lt;ref&gt;Casey, Phil, Being a White Tiger no Problem For Mohini's Five-Week-Old-Cub, The Washington Post Feb. 14, 1964 pg.

Zoo, The Washington Post August 28, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Museum Claims White Tiger Cub, The Washington Post, Sept. 4, 1965 pg. B1&lt;/ref&gt; Rajkumar had a particularly nasty disposition. All of Mohini's cubs were named by the Indian Ambassador. At the time of his death, at only ten months of age, Rajkumar already weighed 175 pounds, and could hardly be called a cub. He was first named "Charlie" by one of his keepers, before the Indian Ambassador gave him his official name. The National Zoo planned to trade Rajkumar for a number of other animals. He was equal to ten zebras in value. The Smithsonian Institution stepped in and vetoed the plan, insisting that Rajkumar would remain a permanent resident of Washington D.C. Rajkumar was the only white tiger fathered by Sampson.

The birth of Mohini's first litter was televised in a national special. Mohini's orange daughter Kesari was born in 1966 with an orange female who was stillborn. It was even suggested, although probably not too seriously, that Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] be asked to bring a white tiger cub for the zoo, when she was scheduled to visit Washington in 1966. After Moni died in 1971 the National Zoo tried to acquire an orange tiger named Ram from [[Trivandrum]] Zoo, in southern India, as a mate for Mohini.&lt;ref&gt;"Death of white tiger" Washington Post July 9, 1971 pgs. B1, B5&lt;/ref&gt; Ram was her first cousin, a grandson of Mohan, and there was a 50% chance that he carried white genes. 25% of Ram's genes came from Mohan and 25% from Begum. 25% of Mohini's genes were from Begum and 75% from Mohan. Ram was a son of Vindhya and Suraj born on 23 IV 1965 at New Delhi Zoo, the same Ram discussed earlier. Two sisters of Ram, born on 22 Feb. 1967, went to the [[Romanshorn]] Zoo in [[Switzerland]]. In 1973 an [[Indochinese tiger]] (''Panthera tigris corbetti'') named Poona, who was born at the [[Woodland Park Zoo]] in [[Seattle]] in 1962, was sent to Washington on a six-month breeding loan from the [[Brookfield Zoo]] and bred to Mohini&lt;ref&gt;"20 year old Mohini Rewa put to death at National Zoo" The Washington Post April 3, 1979 pg. B1&lt;/ref&gt; and Kesari.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman, D.G., 1974 Estrous cycles and behavior of captive tigers. In: The World's Cats (Ed. by R.L. Eaton), pp. 60–75. Seattle, Woodland Park Zoo.&lt;/ref&gt; (Poona would have been regarded as a Bengal tiger for the first two years of his life because the Indo-Chinese subspecies was not recognized until 1968.) Mohini did not conceive. Kesari produced six orange cubs, an extraordinary number, especially for a first litter, but only one survived, a female named Marvina. Kesari handed Marvina over to her keepers and kept the other five. Marvina was mistaken for male, and named Marvin which was changed to Marvina when it was discovered that he was a she. Washington Zoo keeper Art Cooper, who hand reared Marvina, observed that white tigers were the most obstinate cats in the zoo, and said that Marvina had a typical white tiger personality.&lt;ref&gt;"A Zoo for all seasons: the Smithsonian animal world"/Alfred Meyer, editor; writers, Thomas Crosby...et al., Washington D.C. Smithsonian Exposition Book; New York: distributed by Norton, c 1979,&lt;/ref&gt; (Poona also fathered litters by two other tigresses in Brookfield.) In 1974 Marvina, Ramana, and Kesari were sent to the [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden]], and Rewati and Mohini went to the Brookfield Zoo, to be boarded during renovations in Washington, until 1976.
As a fringe benefit of inbreeding the four cubs were pure-Bengal tigers, and they were the last registered Bengal tigers born in the United States. Ranjit, Bharat, Priya, Peela, and Rewati had inbreeding coefficients of 0.406.&lt;ref&gt;Goebel, Anna M. &amp; Whitmore, H. Donald, "Use of Electrophoretic Data in the Reevaluation of Tiger Systematics" Tigers Of The World The Biology, Biopolitics, Management And Conservation Of An Endangered Species, Noyes Publications Park Ridge, New Jersey USA 1987 pg. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Ramana died in 1974 of a kidney infection and became a father for the last time posthumously.

A white half sister of Mohini's, bred from Mohan and Sukishi, born on March 26, 1966, named Gomti&lt;ref name="Thornton"/&gt; and later renamed Princess, lived in the Crandon Park Zoo in Miami for almost three years, before she died of a viral infection at age five in December 1970.&lt;ref name="international1977"/&gt; She arrived in Miami on January 13, 1968.
Miami mayor Chuck Hall met the 22-month-old 350&amp;nbsp;lbs. white tigress at the airport and rode with her to the zoo. He wanted to call her Maya, the name suggested by the Maharaja, which translates as Princess. Ralph S. Scott, who paid $35,000 for her and gave her to the Zoological Society of Florida, preferred the name Princess.&lt;ref name="international1977"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruning, Fred, "Hall Has A White Tiger By The Handle" The Miami Herald Jan. 14, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Lady Is A Tiger" The Miami Herald Jan. 19, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The Zoological Society of Florida loaned Princess to the Crandon Park Zoo. It was Ralph S. Scott, a famous big game hunter, who suggested to John W. Kluge that he buy a white tiger for the children of America. He had seen the white tigers in Govindgarh Palace while tiger hunting in India.&lt;ref name="Reed"/&gt; The government of India wanted Princess to be the last white tiger exported from the country. A male white tiger, named Ravi, acquired by Ralph S. Scott for the Crandon Park Zoo died at [[Kanpur]] railway station en route from India in 1967. He was a son of Raja and Rani born in New Delhi Zoo, and sold by the Maharaja of Rewa. In 1970 [[Jimmy Stewart]] was on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and said that his wife was going to buy a white tiger from the Maharaja of Rewa for the Los Angeles Zoo. Ralph S. Scott was watching and felt as though he was being robbed. He had been trying to get a mate for Princess for years. A bidding war erupted between Scott, Jimmy Stewart, a major league baseball team, a Hollywood producer, and a major European zoo. Scott said of Princess "It is cruel to expect an animal like that to live alone. And you can't mate her with an ordinary tiger-she's so superior...I appealed to the Maharaja from a conservation standpoint and it hit home." Princess and Rajah were to be a "royal couple." The Los Angeles Zoo had already spent $20,000 building a white tiger exhibit. Scott said that he would try and send them a pair of cubs from Princess and Rajah, but Princess died a week before Rajah was scheduled to arrive. Scott hired an Indian taxidermist to stuff Princess, and she was presented to the Museum of Science in Miami in 1972, but she is now in the reception area of the Miami MetroZoo's administration building. Scott paid around $45,000 for Raja, who he thought might still be mated to Mohini, but Rajah never arrived in Crandon Park. Scott was so respected as a tiger hunter that he was asked to deal with man eaters which were terrorizing villages. He was a hunter turned conservationist, and a cat-lover.&lt;ref&gt;Glass, Ian, Miami News, Crandon Park coup: a new white tiger, Dec. 10, 1970; White Tiger Donor Snaps Up A Mate (Before Bigmouth) Dec. 11, 1970; Autopsy still incomplete, Viral infection killeed Crandon's white tiger, Dec. 18, 1970; Dangaard, Colin, Miami's White Tiger Dies A Week Before Wedding, Miami Herald, Dec. 17, 1970; Princess's Ghost, Miami Herald, May 4, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;  Mohini died in 1979.&lt;ref name="smithsonian1979"&gt;Park, Edwards, Around The Mall And Beyond, Smithsonian Sept. 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The skins and skulls of Mohini and Moni are in the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], but are not on display.

An orange brother of Mohini's named Ramesh lived in the [[Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes]] (Paris Zoo), and was bred to an unrelated tigress, but none of the offspring survived to reproduce. Ramesh was born in Govindgarh Palace and had an orange female littermate, named Ratna who went to New Delhi Zoo, and a white male littermate named Ramu.&lt;ref name="Thornton"/&gt; They were the fourth and last litter of Mohan and Radha. Ratna was paired with a wild caught male named Jim, at New Delhi Zoo, and produced three litters. Each cub would have had a 50% chance of inheriting the white gene from Ratna. Jim was captured in the Rewa forest, so they thought there was a chance he carried white genes. He had been somebody's pet, but after he ate a cat he was given to New Delhi Zoo. Jim used to appear leaping into his pond, at New Delhi Zoo, in the opening of one of [[Gerald Durrell]]'s TV shows. [[Edward Pritchard Gee]] mentioned, in his book "The Wildlife Of India" (which has a foreword by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]), that Bristol Zoo wanted to acquire one of the cubs of Mohan and Begum, as a mate for one of its white tigers, Champak or Chameli, to lessen the degree of inbreeding, as the US National Zoo had done with Sampson.&lt;ref&gt;Gee, Edward Pritchard. The wild life of India; with a foreword by Jawaharlal Nehru, London: Collins, 1964 {{ISBN|0-00-211910-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-00-211910-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bristol Zoo did acquire one of the daughters of Mohan and Begum.&lt;ref&gt;Schomberg, Geoffrey, The Penguin guide to British zoos, Harmondsworth, Penguin 1970 {{ISBN|0-14-046154-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 Ranjit, Bharat, Priya, and Peela were sold to the International Animal Exchange. Ranjit, Priya, and Peela went to the IAE's facility in [[Grand Prairie, Texas]]. The phenomenon of spontaneous [[ovulation]] in a tiger was first observed by Devra Kleiman, in one of the white tigresses at the National Zoo, which meant that it was possible to breed tigers by [[artificial insemination]].
Mohini died in 1979 at 20 years of age. Edwards Park wrote in Smithsonian magazine that National Zoo director Ted Reed was "mourning his queen the late Mohini Rewa." Ted Reed said "It's impossible to say how much the zoo owes that cat and her cubs. They drew attention to the facility and made all of our recent improvements so much easier. If she had been human she would have been a movie star."&lt;ref name="smithsonian1979"/&gt;

==Tony, Bagheera, and Frosty: A new strain==
'''Tony''', born in July 1972 in the [[Terrell Jacobs Circus Winter Quarters|Circus Winter Quarters of the Cole Bros. Circus]] (the Terrell Jacobs farm) in [[Peru, Indiana]], was the founder of many American white tiger lines, especially those used in circuses.&lt;ref name="illustrated1986"&gt;Geringer, Dan, "Now He's The Cat's Meow" Sports Illustrated Vol. 65 No. 3 July 21, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather was a registered Siberian tiger, named Kubla, who was born at the [[Como Park, Zoo, and Conservatory]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Edythe Records, The tigers of Como Zoo, New York: Viking Press 1961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siberian tiger cubs born at Como Zoo, The New York Times July 23, 1958 pg. 40:2&lt;/ref&gt; Kubla's parents were born in the wild and believed to be brother and sister. Kubla was bred to a Bengal tigress named Susie, from a west coast zoo, at the Great Plains Zoo in  [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota|Sioux Falls]] in [[South Dakota]]. She was once co-owned by [[Clyde Beatty]]. Between April 10, 1966 and August 3, 1969 Kubla and Susie produced 13 or 14 cubs in 5 or 6 litters. The cubs were widely distributed. One eventually reached Paris, and another went from the [[Utica Zoo]] in [[New York State]] to Japan. Two of their cubs (Rajah and Sheba II) were bred by Baron Julius Von Uhl, who lived in Peru, Indiana. Julius Von Uhl was born in [[Budapest]] and came to America in 1956 from [[Hungary]] after the revolution. One of the results of his tiger breeding was Tony, who therefore carried mixed blood&lt;ref&gt;Van Nostrand, Mary L., "Mohan The Ghost Tiger Of Rewa" Zoonooz May 1984 pgs. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been the source of a gene for stripelessness. Kubla was also bred to an Amur tigress named Katrina, who was born at the [[Rotterdam]] Zoo, and passed through the hands of two American zoos before joining Kubla and Susie at the Great Plains Zoo. Kubla and Katrina have living pure-Amur descendants which may include a line of white tigers, that are claimed as pure-Amurs, which originated out of [[Center Hill, Florida]]. These white tigers are not registered Amur tigers. A tiger trainer named Alan Gold owned a pair of Amur tigers which once produced a stillborn white cub.

In 1972 there were four white tigers in the United States: Mohini and her daughter Rewati in Washington D.C., Tony, and his first cousin  named [[Bagheera]], a female born on July 8, 1972 in a litter of two white cubs, including a male which did not survive, in the Hawthorn Circus of John F. Cuneo Jr. Bagheera's mother, Sheba III, was a sister of Tony's mother, Sheba II. Bagheera's father was either an Amur tiger, named Ural, who was her preferred mate, and may have been her uncle and a littermate, or younger sibling, of Kubla, born at the Como Zoo; or one of two of her brothers, named Prince and Saber, who were also brothers to Tony's parents.&lt;ref name="Thornton2"&gt;Thornton, I.W.B. 1978. White tiger genetics-further evidence. J. Zool. 185:389–394&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Sheba III's litters did not include white cubs, but at least 50% of her orange cubs would have been white gene carriers, since they could have inherited the gene from their mother, and if both parents were heterozygotes 66%, or two out of three, of their orange cubs are likely to have been carriers. She had 27 cubs in 9 litters between July 8, 1972 and July 26, 1975, of which only 3 were white, or 11%, not 25% as would be expected if both parents in each mating were heterozygotes.  Prince was [[Castration|castrated]] before Sheba III conceived another white cub, a male named Frosty, born on Feb. 25, 1975, in a litter which included two orange females and one orange male.&lt;ref name="Thornton2"/&gt; It seems odd that a tiger which may have been fathering such valuable cubs (Prince) would have been neutered. Saber was never observed trying to mate, so perhaps Ural did sire one or more of Sheba III's white cubs, which would have been three quarters [[Siberian tiger|Siberian]] had this been the case. It is possible for tigers from the same litter to have different fathers. It's also possible that any or all three tigers-Ural, Prince, and Saber, carried the white gene. Ural was a sad specimen. He was cross eyed, although he was not white. Bagheera and Frosty were both severely cross eyed.

Tony was purchased by John F. Cuneo Jr., owner of the Hawthorn Circus Corp. of [[Grayslake, Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;"Grrr! Ownership of rare white tiger disputed" The Detroit News Feb. 11, 1975 Section A. pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tiger's Sale O.K.ed For Extra $4000, The Detroit News Feb. 14, 1975 Section A. pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  in February 1975 for $20,000 in Detroit. Tony's parents, Raja and Sheba, produced two more white cubs at the Baltimore County Fair on June 27, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;"Rare tigers born at fair", N.Y. Times June 28, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The cubs were a white male, named "Baltimore County Fair", a white female named "Snowball", and an orange male. National Zoo spokeswoman Sybille Hamlem said: "This could be a real bonus for the breed if the two stay in the United States. The white tigers are no longer found in the wild and there have been genetic problems because of inbreeding. But that's apparently not the case here."&lt;ref&gt;"2 tiger cubs, rare Siberian, born at fair", The Baltimore Sun, Monday June 28, 1976 pg. C.1&lt;/ref&gt; Snowball's name was later changed to "Maharani", and all three cubs were sold to the [[Ringling Bros. Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] in [[Washington D.C.]]. Maharani died in 1984. Baron Julius Von Uhl had another three white cubs born between June 18 and 19, 1977 at Kingdom's 3 (formerly [[Lion Country Safari]]) at [[Stockbridge, Georgia|Stockbridge]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] off I-75 south of [[Atlanta]].&lt;ref&gt;Rare White Tigers Born, The Atlanta Constitution Journal Sunday June 19, 1977 pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Two lived only a short time. The other, named Scarlett O'Hara, died at the Grady Memorial Hospital's animal research clinic in Atlanta, on Jan. 30, 1978, of cardiac arrest resulting from anaesthesia. She was there to undergo surgery to correct crossed eyes. (She was only cross eyed in the right eye, which turned inward toward the nose.) She was still owned by Julius Von Uhl at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Ron, Scarlett O'Hara Sets Sights On Grady, The Atlanta Constitution Journal Wednes. Jan. 18, 1978 pg. 2A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shealy, Larry, Scarlett's Beauty May Have Been Cub's Fatal Flaw, The Atlanta Constitution Journal Friday Jan. 20, 1978 pg. 1A, Tiger's Genetic Flaw Fatal? pg. 19A&lt;/ref&gt; Tony was sent on breeding loan to the Cincinnati Zoo in 1976, to be bred to Rewati from the US National Zoo. However, Tony and Rewati did not breed, so he was bred to Mohini's orange daughter Kesari instead, resulting in a litter of four white and one orange cub June 27, 1976, the same day that eight-year-old Sheba had her white cubs in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. It is an astounding coincidence that both tigresses gave birth to white cubs on exactly the same day. On that one day America's white tiger population nearly doubled from 8 to 14. Kesari's 1976 litter represented a mixture of the two unrelated strains.

All of the white cubs from Kesari's 1976 litter by Tony were cross-eyed, as were Rewati, Bagheera, and Frosty. The Cincinnati Zoo retained a brother and sister pair from the litter, named Bhim and Sumita, and their orange sister Kamala. Two white males returned to the Hawthorn Circus with Tony as John Cuneo's share from the breeding loan. John Cuneo also asked the Bristol Zoo to trade some white tigers, to diversify the gene pool, but the Bristol Zoo declined, perhaps not wishing to exchange pure-Bengals for mongrels. Tony, Bagheera, and Frosty lived for years with a troop of Hawthorn Circus tigers stationed at [[Marineland (Ontario)|Marineland and Game Farm]], in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Because of selective breeding only a few of the oldest white tigers in the Hawthorn Circus today are [[Strabismus|cross eyed]]. Bhim and Sumita became the world record parents of white cubs. In 1976 there were 39 white tigers-7 in New Delhi, 7 in Kolkata, one in [[Guwahati]], one in [[Lucknow]], one in [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], 8 in [[Bristol]], Cincinnati Zoo had 2, Washington had 5, John Cuneo had 5, and Julius Von Uhl had 2. The Maharaja of Rewa retired from the white tiger business in 1976. He later abdicated in favor of his son so that he could run for the family seat in parliament and became an MP. There is a white tiger cub on the shield of the coat of arms of the Maharajas of Rewa.

Over 70 white tigers have been born at the Cincinnati Zoo, which is no longer in the white tiger business. The Cincinnati Zoo sold white tigers&lt;ref&gt;White Bengal tiger imported for Longleat Safari Park, The Times March 22, 1989 pg. 3d&lt;/ref&gt; for $60,000 each. Siegfried &amp; Roy bought a litter of three white cubs from the Cincinnati Zoo, which were offspring of Bhim and Sumita, for around $125,000. Prior to 1974 the Cincinnati Zoo wanted to acquire a white tiger, but no zoo would sell at any price. By the 1980s the Cincinnati Zoo was the world's leading purveyor of white tigers. It was a cousin of the Maharaja of Rewa, Lt. Col. Fatesinghrao "Jackie" Gaekwad, the Maharaja of Baroda, who was also the Commissioner of Indian Wildlife and an MP, who suggested to Siegfried and Roy that they acquire white tigers from the Cincinnati Zoo and include them in their act.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Fischbacher, Siegfried; Horn, Roy Uwe Ludwig, &amp; Tapert, Annette, Siegfried and Roy: mastering the impossible, New York: W. Morrow, c 1992&lt;/ref&gt;"Jackie" was also the President of the [[World Wildlife Fund]] India.  In the mid 1980s Siegfried &amp; Roy owned 10% of the world's white tigers, and they were escorting two big white tiger cubs, with dark stripes, to their new home in [[Phantasialand]] in [[Brühl (Rhineland)|Brühl]], [[Germany]], when the white tigers were briefly stolen with their truck in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;thieves abandon stolen truck containing 2 white tiger cub(s) The Washington Post, June 5, 1987 pg. A 13b&lt;/ref&gt; The driver stopped for coffee. The white tigers made their debut in Germany at a ceremony attended by the United States Ambassador.

The [[Henry Doorly Zoo]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] bought Tony's parents and orange sister Obie (born in 1975) in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Lee G., White Tigers The realities, Tigers Of The World, Noyes Publications Park Ridge, New Jersey USA 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and bred more white tigers. Kesari also went to live at [[Omaha]] Zoo, but did not have any more cubs. Some of Tony's white siblings born in Omaha proved to be sterile. Obie was paired with Ranjit from the National Zoo, and their cubs like those of Tony and Kesari, included non inbred white tigers. A white tiger named Chester, who was a son of Ranjit and Obie, born at the Omaha Zoo, fathered the first test tube tigers,&lt;ref&gt;Stolzenburg, William, Battling extinction with test-tube tigers, Science News May 26, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; and then became the first white tiger in [[Australia]] when he was sent to the [[Taronga Zoo]] in [[Sydney]]. His brother, Panghur Ban, was the National Zoo's last white tiger.&lt;ref&gt;National Zoo's only white tiger euthanized https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002-10-02-white-tiger-dies_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A white tiger named Rajiv, a son of Bhim, became the first white tiger in [[Africa]], when he was sent to Pretoria Zoo in exchange for a [[Cheetah#King cheetah|king cheetah]].&lt;ref&gt;"First White Tiger In Africa" &amp; "How To Breed A White Tiger" Zoon No. 29, 1988–4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 Rewati was paired with Ika, from Kesari's 1976 litter, at the Columbus Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;"Rewati" Columbus ZooViews Autumn 1981&lt;/ref&gt; By this time he was a three legged amputee retired from circus performance, put out to pasture to breed. Ika killed Rewati in the act of mating.&lt;ref&gt;"D.C. born white tiger killed by mate in Columbus (Ohio) zoo" Washington Post April 8, 1983 pg. B3&lt;/ref&gt; Ika was then mated with a white tigress named Taj, who was a grand daughter of his brothers Ranjit and Bhim. Ika was also bred to Taj's orange mother Dolly, a daughter of Bhim and an unrelated orange tigress named Kimanthi, in Columbus. Taj's father, Duke, was a son of Ranjit from an outcross to an unrelated orange tigress. Isson, a white grandson of Kesari and Tony, was also dispatched to Columbus on breeding loan from the Hawthorn Circus, of Grayslake, Illinois, which eventually had 80 white tigers, the largest collection in the world at the time. In 1984 five white tiger cubs were stolen from the Hawthorn Circus in Portland, Oregon, and two died. The tigers were touring with the [[Ringling Bros. Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]]. The culprit was a veterinarian who was sentenced to one year in prison and six months in a halfway house. Cincinnati Zoo director Ed Maruska testified in the case that the five white cubs had a dollar value in excess of $5000.&lt;ref&gt;"Verdict upheld in cubs case"The Baton Rouge Advocate, Nov. 16, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/old/F2/804.F2d.-3012html ]{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 a white cub was born in the [[Racine Zoological Gardens]] in [[Wisconsin]], from a father-daughter mating. The father, named Bucky, killed the white cub. The mother, named Bonnie, was later bred with an orange littermate of Tony named "Chequila", who belonged to James Witchey of [[Ravenna, Ohio]], who bought him from Dick Hartman of [[South Lebanon, Ohio]], when he was four or five years of age. Chequila proved to be a white gene carrier and fathered at least one white cub in the Racine Zoo in 1980. It is not known whether Bucky, who came from the [[Fort Wayne Children's Zoo]] in [[Indiana]], and his daughter Bonnie, were related to any of the established strains of white tigers, but it is possible that Bucky was another one of the cubs of Kubla and Susie, born in Sioux Falls. By 1987 10% of North American zoo tigers were white.

==The Orissa strain==
Three white tigers were also born in the [[Nandankanan Zoo]] in [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Orissa, India]] in 1980. Their parents were an orange father–daughter pair called Deepak and Ganga, who were not related to Mohan or any other captive white tiger – one of their wild-caught ancestors would have carried the recessive white gene, and it showed up when Deepak was mated to his daughter. Deepak's sister also turned out to be a white gene carrier. These white tigers are therefore referred to as the Orissa strain, as opposed to the Rewa strain, of white tigers founded by Mohan.&lt;ref&gt;Roychoudhury, A.K., Chapter 34 "White Tigers And Their Conservation", Part IV "White Tiger Politics", Tigers Of The World, The Biology, Biopolitics, Management And Conservation Of An Endangered Species, Noyes Publications, Park Ridge, New Jersey USA 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roychoudhury, A.K., &amp; L.N. Acharjyo. 1983. Origin of white tigers at Nandankanan Biological Park, Orissa. Indian J. Exper. Biol. 21:350-52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roychoudhury, A.K., A Genetic Analysis Of The White Tigers In The Nandankanan Bio Park, Orissa, 1990 Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roychoudhury A.K. White tigers of Nandankanan lineage. Zoos' Print Journal 4(3):12-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rai, Usha, 1987 Will they outlast this century? Times of India, New Delhi March 15&lt;/ref&gt;

When the surprise birth of three white cubs occurred there was a white tigress already living at the zoo, named Diana, from New Delhi Zoo. One of the three was later bred to her creating another blend of two unrelated strains of white tigers. This lineage resulted in several white tigers in Nandan Kanan Zoo. Today the Nandankanan Zoo has the largest collection of white tigers in India. The Cincinnati Zoo acquired two female white tigers from the Nandan Kanan Zoo, in the hopes of establishing a line of pure-Bengal white tigers in America, but they never got a male, and did not receive authorization from the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA)'s [[Species Survival Plan]] (SSP) to breed them. The Zoo Outreach Organisation used to publish studbooks for white tigers, which were compiled by A.K. Roychoudhury of the [[Bose Institute]] in Calcutta, and subsidized by the Humane Society of India.&lt;ref&gt;Roychoudhury A.K. 1989 About studbook of white tigers in India. Zoos' Print Journal 4:8–9&lt;/ref&gt; The Columbus Zoo had also hoped to breed pure-Bengal white tigers, but were unable to obtain a white registered Bengal mate for Rewati from India.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, David A., &amp; Kohl, Steven G., Developing International Conservation Programs, Tigers Of The World, Noyes Publications Park Ridge, New Jersey USA 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also surprise births of white tigers in the Asian Circus, in India, to parents not known to have been white gene carriers, or heterozygotes, and not known to have any relationship to any other white tiger strains. There was a female white cub born at [[Mysore Zoo]] in 1984, from orange parents, descended from Deepak's sister. The white cub's grandmother Thara came from the Nandankanan Zoo in 1972. Mysore Zoo had a second female white tiger cub from New Delhi Zoo in 1984. On August 29, 1979 a white tigress named Seema was dispatched to [[Kanpur]] Zoo to be bred to Badal, a tiger who was a fourth generation descendant of Mohan and Begum. The pair did not breed so it was decided to pair Seema with one of two wild caught, notorious man eaters, either Sheru or Titu, from the [[Jim Corbett National Park]]. Seema and Sheru produced a white cub, and for a while it was thought there might be white genes in Corbett's population of tigers, but the cub did not stay white.&lt;ref&gt;Roychoudhury, A.K., The Indian White Tiger Studbook, Zoo Zen, International Zoo Outreach Org., Tamil Nadu, India 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The White Bengal Tiger http://www.518.ips12.in.us/CamsPhotos/Tigers/3518.aspx.html{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zoo Dynamics {{cite web |url=http://www.zoopros.com/zd_016.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227035351/http://zoopros.com/zd_016.htm |archivedate=2010-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other cases of white tiger, [[white lion]], and [[white panther]] cubs being born, and then changing to normal color. White tigers which were a mixture of the Rewa and Orissa strains, born at the Nandan Kanan Zoo, were non inbred. A white tiger from out of the Orissa strain found its way to the [[Western Plains Zoo]] in [[Australia]]. Australia's [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]], on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], wanted to breed this tiger to one of their white tigers from the United States.

The '''Center of Advanced European Study and Research''' ('''CAESAR''') was founded in 1995 as part of the compensatory actions under the [[Berlin]]/[[Bonn]] law, which were intended to support structural change in the region of the former capital. The independent foundation operates under private law with foundation capital from the governments of [[Germany]] and the State of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].

caesar is closely associated with the Max Planck Society (MPG). The President of the Max Planck Society chairs the Board of Trustees. The caesar-directors are scientific members of the Max Planck Society. The appointment of the directors, the evaluations and the safeguarding of scientific excellence are realized according to the criteria of the Max Planck Society.

The foundation operates a research center, which does research in the field of neurosciences with modern photonic, molecular biological and chemical methods as well as methods of microtechnology. Here, particularly optical methods are utilized for brain research and brain control. At the moment, caesar is being reorganized thematically. The focus is put on research regarding sensory processes, molecular causes for neurodegenerative diseases and the use of microscopic and spectroscopic methods in neurosciences (“neurophotonics”) in order to identify the operating principles of neural networks and to obtain “soft” control.

Within the main building is also the ''Life Science Inkubator'' (LSI).&lt;ref name="general--414439"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/news/wirtschaft/region/%C3%9Cber-H%C3%BCrdenl%C3%A4ufer-und-Geldverk%C3%A4ufer-article3414439.html |title=GA-Serie "Bonn macht erfinderisch" - Folge 3 - Über Hürdenläufer und Geldverkäufer |author=Joshua Bung |date=2016-11-26 |accessdate=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LSI ist a [[public–private partnership]] (PPP),&lt;ref name="life-sci-Organisa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.life-science-inkubator.de/ueber-lsi/organisation/ |title=Organisation|accessdate=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one partner is CAESAR.

'''Collision-induced dissociation''' ('''CID'''), also known as '''collisionally activated dissociation''' ('''CAD'''), is a [[mass spectrometry]] technique to induce [[fragmentation (chemistry)|fragmentation]] of selected [[ion]]s in the gas phase.&lt;ref name="pmid16401509"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wells JM, McLuckey SA |author2-link=Scott A. McLuckey |title=Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of peptides and proteins |journal=Meth. Enzymol. |volume=402 |issue= |pages=148–85 |year=2005 |pmid=16401509 |doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(05)02005-7|series=Methods in Enzymology |isbn=9780121828073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15481084"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sleno L, Volmer DA |title=Ion activation methods for tandem mass spectrometry |journal=Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=1091–112 |year=2004 |pmid=15481084 |doi=10.1002/jms.703|bibcode=2004JMSp...39.1091S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The selected ions (typically molecular ions or protonated molecules)  are usually  [[accelerate]]d by applying an [[electrical potential]] to increase the ion [[kinetic energy]] and then allowed to collide with neutral molecules (often [[helium]], [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]]). In the collision some of the kinetic energy is converted into [[internal energy]] which results in bond breakage and the fragmentation of the molecular ion into smaller fragments. These fragment ions can then be analyzed by [[tandem mass spectrometry]].

CID and the fragment ions produced by CID are used for several purposes. Partial or complete structural determination can be achieved. In some cases identity can be established based on previous knowledge without determining structure. Another use is in simply achieving more sensitive and specific detection. By detecting a unique fragment ion, the precursor ion can be detected in the presence of other ions of the mass-to-charge ratio, reducing the background and increasing the limit of detection.

== Low-energy CID and High-energy CID ==
Low-energy CID is typically carried out with ion kinetic energies less than approximately 1 kiloelectron volt (1 keV).  Low-energy CID is highly efficient in fragmenting the selected precursor ions, but the type of fragment ions observed in low-energy CID is strongly dependent on the ion kinetic energy.  Very low collision energies favor ion structure rearrangement, and the probability of direct bond cleavage increases as ion kinetic energy increases, leading to higher ion internal [[Unimolecular ion decomposition#Wahrhaftig diagram|energies]].    High-energy CID (HECID) is carried out in magnetic sector mass spectrometers or tandem magnetic sector mass spectrometers and in tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometers (TOF/TOF).  High-energy CID involves ion kinetic energies in the kilovolt range (typically 1 keV to 20 keV).  High-energy CID can produce some types of fragment ions that are not formed in low-energy CID, such as charge-remote fragmentation in molecules with hydrocarbon substructures or sidechain fragmentation in peptides. 

==Triple quadrupole mass spectrometers==
In a [[triple quadrupole]] mass spectrometer there are three [[quadrupole]]s. The first quadrupole termed "Q1" can act as a mass filter and transmits a selected ion and accelerates it towards "Q2" which is termed a collision cell. The pressure in Q2  is higher and the ions collides with neutral gas in the collision cell and is fragmented by CID. The fragments are then accelerated out of the collision cell and enter Q3 which scans through the mass range, analyzing the resulting fragments (as they hit a detector).  This produces a [[mass spectrum]] of the CID fragments from which structural information or identity can be gained. Many other experiments using CID on a triple quadrupole exist such as precursor ion scans that determines where a specific fragment came from rather than what fragments are produced by a given molecule.

==Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance==
Ions trapped in the ICR cell can be excited by applying pulsed electric fields at their resonant frequency to increase their kinetic energy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cody|first=R.B.|last2=Freiser|first2=B.S.|date=1982|title=Collision-induced dissociation in a fourier-transform mass spectrometer|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0020738182850353|journal=International Journal of Mass Spectrometry and Ion Physics|volume=41|issue=3|pages=199–204|doi=10.1016/0020-7381(82)85035-3|issn=0020-7381|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cody|first=R.

The duration and amplitude of the pulse determines the ion kinetic energy.  Because a collision gas present at low pressure requires a long time for excited ions to collide with neutral molecules, a pulsed valve can be used to introduce a short burst of collision gas.  Trapped fragment ions or their ion-molecule reaction products can be re-excited for multistage mass spectrometry (MS&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cody|first=R.

If the excitation is not applied on the resonant frequency, but at a slightly off-resonant frequency, the ions will alternately be excited and de-excited, permitting multiple collisions at low collision energy.

==Higher-energy C-trap dissociation==
'''Higher-energy collisional dissociation''' ('''HCD''') is a CID technique specific to the [[orbitrap]] mass spectrometer in which fragmentation takes place external to the trap.&lt;ref name="pmid17721543"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olsen JV, Macek B, Lange O, Makarov A, Horning S, Mann M |title=Higher-energy C-trap dissociation for peptide modification analysis |journal=Nat. Methods |volume=4 |issue=9 |pages=709–12 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17721543 |doi=10.1038/nmeth1060 |url=http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v4/n9/full/nmeth1060.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; HCD was formerly known as higher-energy C-trap dissociation. In HCD, the ions pass through the C-trap and into the HCD cell, an added multipole collision cell, where dissociation takes place. The ions are then returned to the C-trap before injection into the orbitrap for mass analysis. HCD does not suffer from the low mass cutoff of resonant-excitation (CID) and therefore is useful for [[isobaric tag]]–based quantification as reporter ions can be observed. Despite the name, the collision energy of HCD is typically in the regime of low energy collision induced dissociation (less than 100 eV).&lt;ref name="pmid17721543" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MurrayBoyd2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=Kermit K.|last2=Boyd|first2=Robert K.|last3=Eberlin|first3=Marcos N.|last4=Langley|first4=G.

==Fragmentation mechanisms==
[[File:Homolysis (Chemistry).png|thumb|350px|Homolytic fragmentation]]
[[Homolysis (chemistry)|Homolytic fragmentation]] is bond dissociation where each of the fragments retains one of the originally-bonded electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=homolysis (homolytic)|300px|thumb|file=H02851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heterolysis (Chemistry).png|300px|thumb|Heterolytic fragmentation]]
[[Heterolysis (chemistry)|Heterolytic fragmentation]] is bond cleavage where the bonding electrons remain with only one of the fragment species.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=heterolysis (heterolytic)|file=H02809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In CID, charge remote fragmentation is a type of [[covalent bond]] breaking that occurs in a gas phase ion in which the cleaved bond is not adjacent to the location of the charge.&lt;ref name="pmid11199379"&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Cheng C, Gross ML |title=Applications and mechanisms of charge-remote fragmentation |journal=Mass Spectrom Rev |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=398–420 |year=2000 |pmid=11199379 |doi=10.1002/1098-2787(2000)19:6&lt;398::AID-MAS3&gt;3.0.CO;2-B |postscript=.|bibcode=2000MSRv...19..398C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gross2000&gt;{{citation | last = Gross | first =  M. | year = 2000 | title = Charge-remote fragmentation: an account of research on mechanisms and applications | journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 200 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 611 | doi = 10.1016/S1387-3806(00)00372-9 |bibcode = 2000IJMSp.200..611G }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fragmentation can be observed using [[tandem mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | year = 1988 | title = Remote-site (charge-remote) fragmentation | journal = Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry | volume = 2 | issue = 10 | pages = 214 | doi = 10.1002/rcm.1290021009 | bibcode = 1988RCMS....2..214. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7939">'''Corn silk''' is a common name for the shiny, thread-like, weak [[fiber]]s that grow as part of [[ear (botany)|ears]] of corn ([[maize]]); the tuft or [[tassel]] of silky fibers that protrude from the tip of the ear of corn. The ear is enclosed in modified leaves called [[husk]]s. Each individual fiber is an elongated [[style (botany)|style]], attached to an individual [[ovary (botany)|ovary]].&lt;ref name=dic&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/corn-silk | title=The definition of corn silk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term probably originated somewhere between 1850 and 1855.&lt;ref name=dic/&gt;

== Development ==
Up to 1000 [[ovule]]s (potential kernels) form per ear of corn, each of which produces a strand of corn silk from its tip that eventually emerges from the end of the ear.  The emergence of at least one strand of silk from a given ear of corn is defined as growth stage R1, and the emergence of silk in 50% of the plants in a corn field is called "mid-silk".  The silk lengthens from the basal ovules during the 10 to 14 days previous to growth stage R1; this is due to a change of shape of existing cells rather than their replication.  The elongation progresses at 1.5 inches per day at first, but gradually slows as the full length is approached.  Elongation of a corn silk strand stops soon after a grain of pollen is captured, or due to [[senescence]] of the silk 10 days after its emergence.&lt;ref name=Purdue&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agry.purdue.edu/ext/corn/news/timeless/silks.html|title=Silk development and emergence in corn|publisher=Purdue University Department of Agronomy (Corny News Network)|date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If an ovule is successfully fertilized, the corn silk will detach from it two or three days later.  Otherwise, the silk will remain attached indefinitely, and fertilization remains possible (with decreasing chances of success) for 10 days after silk emergence.  For this reason, it is possible to sample developing ears of corn from a field, husking them gently with a sharp knife, then shaking them to assess the progress of pollination based on how much of the corn silk falls away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agry.purdue.edu/ext/corn/news/timeless/EarShake.html|title=A Fast &amp; Accurate "Pregnancy" Test for Corn|author=R.L. (Bob) Nielsen|publisher=Purdue University Department of Agriculture Corny News Network|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
Corn silk is part [[stigma (botany)|stigma]] and part [[style (botany)|style]], providing a female flower surface to which pollen grains can adhere and defining the lengthy path through which the pollen must transmit its genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIfw9sxcxDIC&amp;pg=PA145|title=Teaching of Biology|author=S. Choudhary|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=9788176485241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stigma is the very tip of the corn silk, which has a larger number of hairs to help pollen to adhere to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backyardnature.net/fl_corn.htm|title=Corn (maize) flowers|publisher=Backyard nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kernel formation in the cob requires [[pollination]] of the external corn silk by wind or insects.  Usually several grains of pollen adhere, but only one will successfully participate in [[fertilization]] of the ovule to form a corn kernel.

For the pollen grain, the male [[gametophyte]], to transmit its genetic material to the ovule, it must [[germinate]] and form a [[pollen tube]] that extends down nearly the full length of the corn silk strand.  Typically 400 to 600 kernels are successfully formed in this way.&lt;ref name=Purdue /&gt;  The pollen tube extends at a rate of over 1 centimeter per hour, requiring only 24 hours to create a foot-long pathway within the intercellular space of the corn silk, through which the sperm cells (the [[gamete]]s) pass to join the female gametophyte within the ovule.  The pollen tube is produced by the single [[vegetative cell]] in the pollen grain, which passes its cytoplasm, nucleus and two sperm cells into the tube.   The tube extends itself at the apex only, in an actin polymerization dependent process, and the direction in which the apex progresses responds to [[cyclic AMP]] levels, including cAMP cyclization by a pollen signalling protein (PSiP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160606014035|title=How pollen tubes grow|author=Alexander Krichevsky et al.|journal=Developmental Biology|volume=303|year=2007|pages=405–420|doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.12.003|pmid=17214979|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corn silk can control the types of pollen that an ear of corn will accept through expression of certain forms of the [[Gametophyte Factor 1]] gene.  Many races of [[popcorn]], of the [[everta]] type, will greatly slow the development of pollen tubes from any pollen that does not carry a similar form of Ga1-S or Ga1-M, thereby preventing the ingression of genes (natural or engineered) from other types of corn.  The popcorn remains free to donate its genes via its own pollen to other types of corn.  The effectiveness of this restriction can be measured by planting the popcorn beside purple [[dent corn]]; the [[xenia effect]] would cause the formation of purple [[aleurone]]s if kernels permitted themselves to be fertilized by pollen from outside the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KD30AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55|title=Beautiful Corn: America's Original Grain from Seed to Plate|author=Anthony Boutard|publisher=New Society Publishers|date=2012-09-25|isbn=9780865717282}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Organic farmer]]s are pursuing the transfer of some of these mechanisms into non-popcorn strains for purposes of preventing inadvertent pollination by GMO corn, which under U.S. regulations can cause their product to be rejected as organic corn, and for which they have no recourse against GMO growers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://non-gmoreport.com/articles/september-2014/plant-breeder-save-organic-corn-from-GMO-contamination.php|title=Plant breeder works to save organic corn from GMO contamination|author=Ken Roseboro|date=August 28, 2014|publisher=Non GMO report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathology ==
[[File:Western corn rootworm.jpg|thumb|In its adult stage, a [[Western corn rootworm]] searches for pollen on corn silk.  This insect can be a cause of silk clipping.]]
The moisture of freshly emerged corn silk sometimes attracts insects, which can cause silk clipping, which can interfere with kernel formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefarmerslife.com/what-is-the-purpose-of-corn-silk/|title=What is the Purpose of Corn Silk?|publisher=The Farmer's Life|date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Corn silk contains a variety of pharmacologically-active compounds, and as such is used in many types of folk medicine, including as a [[diuretic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4163">The '''covering problem of Rado''' is an unsolved problem in [[geometry]] concerning covering planar sets by squares. It was formulated in 1928 by [[Tibor Radó]] and has been generalized to more general shapes and higher dimensions by [[Richard Rado]].

== Formulation==

In a letter to [[Wacław Sierpiński]], motivated by some results of [[Giuseppe Vitali]], Tibor Radó observed that for every [[cover (topology)|covering]] of a unit interval, one can select a subcovering consisting of pairwise disjoint intervals with total length at least 1/2 and that this number cannot be improved. He then asked for an analogous statement in the plane.

: ''If the area of the union of a finite set of squares in the plane with parallel sides is one, what is the guaranteed maximum total area of a pairwise disjoint subset?''
 
Radó proved that this number is at least 1/9 and conjectured that it is at least 1/4 a constant which cannot be further improved. This assertion was proved for the case of equal squares independently by A. Sokolin, R. Rado, and [[Victor Zalgaller|V. A. Zalgaller]]. However, in 1973, [[Miklós Ajtai]] ''disproved'' Radó's conjecture, by constructing a system of squares of two different sizes for which any subsystem consisting of disjoint squares covers the area at most 1/4&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1/1728 of the total area covered by the system.

== Upper and lower bounds ==

Problems analogous to Tibor Radó's conjecture but involving other shapes were considered by Richard Rado starting in late 1940s. A typical setting is a finite family of [[convex set|convex figures]] in the [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; that are [[Homothetic transformation|homothetic]] to a given ''X'', for example, a square as in the original question, a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]], or a ''d''-dimensional [[cube]]. Let

: &lt;math&gt; F(X)=\inf_{S}\sup_{I}\frac{|I|}{|S|}, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''S'' ranges over finite families just described, and for a given family ''S'', ''I'' ranges over all subfamilies that are ''independent'', i.e. consist of disjoint sets, and bars denote the total volume (or area, in the plane case). Although the exact value of ''F''(''X'') is not known for any two-dimensional convex ''X'', much work was devoted to establishing upper and lower bounds in various classes of shapes. By considering only families consisting of sets that are parallel and congruent to ''X'', one similarly defines ''f''(''X''), which turned out to be much easier to study. Thus, R. Rado proved that if ''X'' is a triangle, ''f''(''X'') is exactly 1/6 and if ''X'' is a centrally symmetric [[hexagon]], ''f''(''X'') is equal to 1/4.

In 2008, Sergey Bereg, Adrian Dumitrescu, and Minghui Jiang established new bounds for various ''F''(''X'') and ''f''(''X'') that improve upon earlier results of R. Rado and V. A. Zalgaller. In particular, they proved that

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{8.4797}\leq F(\textrm{square})\leq\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{384},&lt;/math&gt;

and that &lt;math&gt;f(X)\geq\frac{1}{6}&lt;/math&gt; for any convex planar ''X''.

'''Elsa Guðbjörg Vilmundardóttir''' (27 November 1932 – 23 April 2008) was the first Icelandic woman to complete a degree in geology and was the country's first female geologist.

Elsa was born in the [[Vestmannaeyjar]]. Her parents were Vilmundur Guðmundsson, an engineer from Hafnarnes, [[Reyðarfjörður]] (1907–34) and Gudrun Björnsdóttir, a seamstress (1903–75). At the age of three, Elsa moved with her parents from the islands to [[Siglufjörður]]; her father drowned shortly thereafter. She then moved in with her maternal grandparents and at the age of 12, she moved to her mother's home in [[Reykjavík]].

Elsa graduated from [[Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík]] in 1953. In 1958, she went to Sweden and enrolled at [[Stockholm University]]. She studied geology in 1958–63. During her university years, she did geological fieldwork in the summers on behalf of Electricity Department, mostly though geological research of the proposed [[Búrfellsvirkjun]] hydropower plant. Her interest quickly focused on the geology of [[Tungnáröræfa]]. After completing her studies in 1963, she returned home and began working at jobs at the Electricity Department, followed by the [[National Energy Authority]] (NEA) of Iceland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jökull |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmhNAQAAIAAJ |year=2008 |publisher=Jöklarannsóknafélag Íslands og Jarðfrœðafélag Islands |page=135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when it was formed in 1967, working there until she retired in 2004. In 1980, an agreement was made between the NEA and [[Landsvirkjun]] on uniform geological mapping and was the supervisor of the project. Elsa's research also included mapping [[tuff]] and lava north of [[Vatnajökull]], as well as [[pyroclastic flow]]s associated with prehistoric [[Hekla]] eruptions. She wrote about scientific research and was the co-author of  ''100 Geosites in South-Iceland''.

'''Engineering education research (EER)''' is the field of inquiry that creates knowledge which aims to define, inform, and improve the education of engineers. It achieves this through research on topics such as: epistemology, policy, assessment, pedagogy, diversity, amongst others, as they pertain to engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nazempour |first1=Arshan |title=Assessments of Ultra-Low-Cost Venturi Nozzle in Undergraduate Engineering Classes |journal=American Society For Engineering Education |date=2015 |url=https://www.asee.org/public/conferences/56/papers/12706/view |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052137/https://www.asee.org/public/conferences/56/papers/12706/view |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==

Engineering education research gained visibility during the 1980s, although the formal education of engineers in the [[United States]] traces back to as early as 1802, with the establishment of the United States Military Academy at West Point for the purpose of training the U.S. Army's corps of engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, D. F. (1979). America by design: Science, technology, and the rise of corporate capitalism.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Terry S. (1992). "The Education of Engineers in America Before the Morrill Act of 1862," History of Education Quarterly, 32 (Winter): 459-82.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rensselaer School (now Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) was founded in 1824 and conferred degrees in civil engineering upon four students in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education. (1930). "Report of the Investigation of Engineering Education 1923-1929." Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurred by concerns of national competitiveness and the insufficient number of graduating engineers&lt;ref&gt;A Nation at Risk (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; the Neal Report called for research to improve teaching and learning in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields.&lt;ref&gt;Neal Report (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to other disciplines, the 1990s brought a focus on the scholarship of teaching as demonstrated by the 1995 NRC Report,&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council Board on Engineering Education. 1995. Engineering education: Designing an adaptive system. Washington, DC: National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; "Engineering education: Designing an adaptive system", influenced by Ernst Boyer.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, E.L. 1990. Scholarship reconsidered: Priorities of the professoriate. Princeton, NJ: Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This focus was primarily motivated by the need to improve the quality of engineers produced by universities in the US. Additionally, 1993 marked the relaunch of the ''[[Journal of Engineering Education]]'', which served as a clearinghouse for scholarly research.&lt;ref name="Jesiek_etal_2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brent K. Jesiek |author2=Lynita K. Newswander |author3=Maura Borrego |last-author-amp=yes |year=2009 |title=Engineering education research: discipline, community, or field? |journal=[[Journal of Engineering Education]] |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=39–52 |doi=10.1002/j.2168-9830.2009.tb01004.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As concerns regarding globalization and the need for innovation increased during the late 1990s and 2000s, engineering education research was influenced by calls of reform to produce the quantity and diversity of engineers needed to address global problems.&lt;ref name="Jesiek_etal_2009"/&gt;

Continuing the development of the field, centers for engineering education research emerged in the early 2000s. The NAE formed a Committee on Engineering Education (CEE) in 1999, NAE’s Center for the Advancement of Scholarship on Engineering Education (CASEE) was established in 2002 and the Center for the Advancement of Engineering in 2003.&lt;ref name="Jesiek_etal_2009"/&gt;

During the mid-2000s, dedicated funding, specialized publications, centers for research, academic preparation and conferences which connected the distributed community supplied the infrastructure necessary for the burgeoning field of research.&lt;ref name="Jesiek_etal_2009"/&gt;

== Core research areas ==

The 2006 Report of the Steering Committee of the National Engineering Education Research Colloquies outlined the 5 key topic areas of engineering education research as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Colloquies. (2006). The Research Agenda for the New Discipline of Engineering Education. ''[[Journal of Engineering Education]]'' (October), 259-261.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Engineering Epistemologies: Research on what constitutes engineering thinking and knowledge within [[social context]]s now and into the future
# Engineering Learning Mechanisms: Research on engineering learners’ developing knowledge and competencies in context.
# Engineering Learning Systems: Research on the [[instructional culture]], [[institutional infrastructure]], and [[epistemology]] of engineering educators.
# Engineering Diversity and Inclusiveness:  Research on how diverse human talents contribute solutions to the social and global challenges and relevance of our [the engineering] profession.
# Engineering Assessment:  Research on, and the development of, assessment methods, instruments, and metrics to inform [[engineering education]] practice and learning.

== Other research areas ==

=== Globalization ===
According to Borrego and Bernhard,&lt;ref name="Borrego_Bernhard"&gt;Borrego, M., &amp; Bernhard, J. (2011) "The emergence of engineering education research as an internationally connected field of inquiry." ''[[Journal of Engineering Education]]''. 100 (1): 14–47.&lt;/ref&gt; international collaborations are developing in an effort to create global competencies in engineering students. Engineering global competency is the possession of "the knowledge, ability, and predisposition to work effectively with people who define and solve problems differently than they do." &lt;ref&gt;Downey et al., "The Globally Competent Engineer: Working Effectively with People Who Define Problems Differently," ''[[Journal of Engineering Education]]'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Educational programs that emphasize global engineering competencies research the development and assessment of global competency within the engineering practice.&lt;ref&gt;https://engineering.purdue.edu/GEP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://globalhub.org/resources/4427/download/GE3_April_2011_bkj_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of programs in global engineering competency include:
*The Global Engineering Program at Purdue University
*[[Erasmus mundus]] (student centric global program)&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/education/external-relation-programmes/doc72_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

R&amp;D departments in transnational companies also contribute to international educational research.

===Global engineering cultures===

In 2008, a project titled "The Engineering Cultures Multimedia Project" was approved by the NSF. It was done by combine effort of "Virginia Tech and Colorado School of Mines to produce CD-based modules exploring how what counts as an engineer and engineering knowledge varies from country to country". https://globalhub.org/topics/AboutEngineeringCultures
The main goal of this project was "To develop, disseminate, and assess learning experiences that will help students to identify, understand, and value perspectives other than their own."&lt;ref&gt;https://globalhub.org/topics/EngineeringCultures&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-college engineering education ===

Studies indicate that engineers will be better prepared for rigorous study in the engineering sciences if exposed to engineering concepts in the years prior to university study.  The following resources have been listed to provide primary- and secondary-level educators with information and online programs that will aide them in bringing engineering material to their classrooms.

== Methodology ==
“Rigorous” research in engineering education is defined as adherence to the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]’s six guiding principles for [[scientific inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;Borrego, M. (2007). "Conceptual difficulties experienced by trained engineers learning educational research methods." ''[[Journal of Engineering Education]]''. 96(2): 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The six guiding principles for scientific inquiry are:&lt;ref&gt;Shavelson, R., and L. Towne, Scientific Research in Education, Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, 2002. Scientific Research in Education, Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Pose significant questions that can be investigated empirically.
# Link research to relevant theory.
# Use methods that permit direct investigation of the question.
# Provide explicit, coherent chain of reasoning.
# Replicate and generalize across studies.
# Disclose research to encourage professional scrutiny and critique.

== Connection to practice ==

Engineering education research is conducted based on the demands and patterns of engineering in industry, policy, and education. Globally, emphasis of research focuses on educational application. Research into industry and practice have yet to gain greater attention.&lt;ref name="Jesiek_etal_2010"&gt;Jesiek, B. K., Borrego, M., &amp; Beddoes, K. (2010) "Advancing global capacity for engineering education research (AGCEER): relating research to practice, policy, and industry." ''[[Journal of Engineering Education]]''. 99 (2): 107-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industry ===

=== Policy ===

In the [[United States]], there has been a greater push for development of formal policy for educating engineers.  In 1918, the [http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1T4GGLL_enUS374US374&amp;q=Mann%2c+C.+%281918%29.+Study+of+Engineering+Education Mann Report] noted an imminent lack of qualified engineers that could rapidly enter the workforce.  There should be more hands-on experience, engineering educators should have practical work experience, and teaching should be more prominent even though research is also important. In 1955, the Grinter report specifically outlined undergraduate and graduate level engineering studies.  Since then, some of these suggestions, including the senior capstone design course, have been implemented in public and private engineering institutions.

Engineering education policy is externally driven to some degree.  [[ABET]] accreditation has incorporated industrial demands as part of the accreditation process.  ABET EC 2000 emphasizes both technical (design, problem solving) and professional skills (teamwork, communication, ethical/global thinking).

''P-12 Educational Standards:''

National policies such as [[No Child Left Behind]] and [[Race to the Top]] have influenced the recruitment and retention of future engineers.

In April 2013, the Next Generation Science Standards were released as the science standards for K-12 science education in the [[United States]] to replace the [[National Science Education Standards]]. These include engineering-based standards embedded within the science standards. The National Assessment Governing Board has created a Technology and Literacy Framework for the 2014 National Assessment of Educational Progress. This will be a pilot test and may turn into a permanent fixture of future testing.

=== Educational ===

There is a disconnect between engineering education research findings and implementation of the findings into the classroom. Research findings are published in a variety of journals primarily read by other researchers, not P-12 teachers or university faculty outside of the Education field. This breakdown of transfer between research and practice prevents the desired outcomes at the heart of the research&lt;ref&gt;American Society for Engineering Education, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borrego_Bernhard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jesiek_etal_2010"/&gt;

There have been proposals to connect Engineering Education practice and Engineering Education research. A cyclical model of transfer between research and practice has been proposed by Jesiek et al. (2010) and Borrego &amp; Bernhard (2011).  This model allows research and practice to continuously influence and develop one another.

== Organizations and publications ==
There are several professional organizations devoted to engineering education, including: 
* [[American Society for Engineering Education]]
* [[European Society for Engineering Education]] 
* [[International Technology and Engineering Educators Association]]

The '''Gaskiers glaciation''' is a period of widespread [[glacial deposit]]s (e.g. [[diamictite]]s) that lasted under 340 thousand years, between 579.63 ± 0.15 and 579.88 ± 0.44 million years ago&lt;ref name=Pu&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1130/G38284.1|title=Dodging snowballs: Geochronology of the Gaskiers glaciation and the first appearance of the Ediacaran biota|journal=Geology|volume=44|issue=11|pages=955|year=2016|last1=Pu|first1=Judy P.|last2=Bowring|first2=Samuel A.|last3=Ramezani|first3=Jahandar|last4=Myrow|first4=Paul|last5=Raub|first5=Timothy D.|last6=Landing|first6=Ed|last7=Mills|first7=Andrea|last8=Hodgin|first8=Eben|last9=MacDonald|first9=Francis A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; – i.e. late in the [[Ediacaran Period]] – making it the last major glacial event of the [[Precambrian]].&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Gradstein, Gabi Ogg, Mark Schmitz, ''The Geologic Time Scale'', Elsevier, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;428.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deposits attributed to the Gaskiers - assuming that they were all deposited at the same time - have been found on eight separate [[palaeocontinent]]s, in some cases occurring close to the [[equator]] (at a latitude of 10-30°).  The 300&amp;nbsp;m-thick name-bearing section at [[Gaskiers-Point_La_Haye|Gaskiers]] (Newfoundland) is packed full of striated [[dropstone]]s.&lt;ref name=Pu/&gt;  Its [[δ13C|{{d13c}}]] values are really low (pushing 8{{permil}}), consistent with a period of environmental abnormality.&lt;ref name=Pu/&gt;  The bed lies just below some of the oldest fossils of the [[Ediacaran biota]], leading to early suggestions that the passing of the glaciation may have paved the way for the evolution of these odd organisms.  More accurate dating methods have shown that there is in fact a 9 million year gap between the diamictites and the 570 Ma macrofossils.&lt;ref name=Pu/&gt;

'''Hans Fruhstorfer''' (7 March 1866 [[Passau]], [[Germany]] – 9 April 1922 [[Munich]]) was a [[Germany|German]] explorer, insect trader and [[entomologist]] who specialised in [[Lepidoptera]].  He collected and described new species of exotic butterflies, especially in [[Adalbert Seitz]]'s ''Macrolepidoptera of the World''. He is best known for his work on the butterflies of [[Java]].

His career began in 1888 when he spent two years in [[Brazil]]. The expedition was financially successful and led to his becoming a professional collector. Next he spent some time in [[Sri Lanka]] (then Ceylon), then in 1890 he went to Java for three years, visiting [[Sumatra]]. Between 1895 and 1896 he collected in [[Sulawesi]], [[Lombok]] and [[Bali]]. In 1899, he went on a three-year journey to the United States, [[Oceania]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Tonkin]], [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] and [[Siam]], returning via [[India]].

Following his travels, he settled in [[Geneva]] where he wrote [[monograph]]s based on the specimens in his extensive private collection.{{cn|date=August 2013}} Many of these were incorporated into Seitz's work. In taxonomy he made extensive use of the structure of the male genitalia. Fruhstorfer, in these years also studied [[Palearctic]] butterflies, [[Orthoptera]] and [[botany]]. No longer travelling himself, Fruhstorfer employed the collectors {{ill|Hans Sauter|de|Hans Sauter (Entomologe)}} in Formosa and [[Franz Werner]] in New Guinea.

Fruhstorfer's collections are deposited at the [[Museum für Naturkunde]] in Berlin, the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London and the [[Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]] in Paris, as well as in many other museums.

Fruhstorfer died in Munich on 9 April 1922, following a failed operation for [[cancer]].

[[Image:NorwegiansolderHK416.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Norway|Norwegian]] soldier armed with [[HK416|HK416N]] in [[Afghanistan]] wearing an '''infrared flag''' on his right arm (note the subdued colour).]]
An '''infrared flag''' (or '''IR flag''') is a type of [[Identification friend or foe|combat identification]] used by soldiers. They consist of a national flag or other identifying icon with a [[Velcro]] backing for application to a soldier's uniform on the upper arm or chest.

==Function==
IR flags are rendered in materials that result in a high contrast ratio in the [[infrared]] spectrum. They are designed to show up brightly whilst being observed through [[night vision device|night vision equipment]], as found on modern combat aircraft or [[attack helicopter]]s. They are designed to protect the soldier from [[friendly fire]].

However, camouflage (if any) is not compromised as the materials produce a low contrast ratio in the [[visible spectrum]], and are thus not easily visible to the naked eye.

==Restrictions==
In early stages of their production, these patches were easily available for [[civilian]]s to purchase, and the [[Taliban]] and [[al-Qaeda]] bought them or stole them from fallen [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) soldiers since the coalition attack aircraft were not authorized to fire upon anyone wearing the patch.

Since this came to light, the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] has restricted all export of these patches. Because they are popular with [[Airsoft]]ers, some replica versions have been produced which are not [[infrared]] reflective.

[[File:Pollution de l'air.jpg|thumb|Pollution from a factory]]
'''I = PAT''' is the mathematical notation of a formula put forward to describe the [[human impacts on the environment|impact of human activity on the environment]].

:'''I''' = '''P''' × '''A''' × '''T'''

The expression equates [[Environmental issue|human impact on the environment]] to the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of three [[independent variable|factors]]: [[World population|Population]], [[Affluence]], and [[Technology]]. It is similar in form to the [[Kaya identity]] which applies specifically to emissions of the [[greenhouse gas]] [[carbon dioxide]].

The validity of expressing environmental impact as a simple product of independent factors, and the factors that should be included and their comparative importance, have been the subject of debate among environmentalists. In particular, some have drawn attention to potential inter-relationships among the three factors; and others have wished to stress other factors not included in the formula, such as political and social structures, and the scope for beneficial, as well as harmful, environmental actions.

==History==
The equation was developed in 1970 during the course of a debate between [[Barry Commoner]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[John Holdren]]. Commoner argued that [[environmental impact]]s in the United States were caused primarily by changes in its production technology following [[World War II]] and aimed his thoughts on present day deteriorating environmental conditions in the U.S. Ehrlich and Holdren argued that all three factors were important and emphasized in particular the role of human [[population growth]], but focused more on a broader scale, being less specific in space and time.&lt;ref name ="End of Population Growth"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = B.C. |last2 = MacKellar | first2 = F.L. | first3 = W.| last3= Lutz | date = 2004 | chapter = Population, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change | title = The End of World Population Growth in the 21st Century: New Challenges for Human Capital Formation &amp; Sustainable Development | editor1-first = W. | editor1-last = Lutz | editor2-first = W.C. | editor2-last= Sanderson | editor3-first= S. | editor3-last = Scherbov | publisher = Earthscan Press | location = London | pages = 283–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ehrlich  | first1 = Paul R.  | authorlink1 = Paul R.

[[Lynn Steen]], pp 111-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The dependent variable: Impact==
&lt;!-- A definition of impact was missing. Added here.  --&gt;

The variable "I" in the "I=PAT" equation represents environmental impact. The environment may be viewed as a self-regenerating system that can sustain a certain level of impact sustainably. The maximum sustainable impact is called the [[carrying capacity]]. As long as "I" is less than this amount the associated population, affluence, and technology that make up "I" are sustainable. If "I" exceeds the carrying capacity, then the system is said to be in [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot]], which can only be a temporary state. Overshoot may degrade the ability of the environment to sustain impact, therefore reducing the carrying capacity.

Impact may be measured using [[ecological footprint]] analysis in units of [[global hectares]] (gha). Ecological footprint per capita is a measure of the quantity of  Earth's biologically productive surface that is needed to regenerate the resources consumed per capita.

Impact is modeled as the product of three terms, giving gha as a result. Population is expressed in human numbers, therefore Affluence is measured in units of gha per capita. Technology is a unitless efficiency  factor.

==The three factors==
===Population===
{{See also|World population|Human overpopulation}}

[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|right|Population (est.) 10,000 BC – 2000 AD.]]

In the '''I=PAT''' equation, the variable '''P''' represents the population of an area, such as the world. Since the rise of industrial societies, human population has been increasing exponentially. This has caused [[Thomas Malthus]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] and many others{{Who|date=February 2011}} to postulate that this growth would continue until checked by widespread hunger and famine (see [[Malthusian growth model]]).

The United Nations project that world population will increase from 7.6 billion today (2018) to 9.8 billion in 2050 and about 11.2 billion in 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_KeyFindings.pdf|title=Population Prospects 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These projections take into consideration that population growth has slowed in recent years as women are having fewer children. This phenomenon is the result of [[demographic transition]] all over the world. The UN projects that human population might stabilize around 11.2 billion in 2100 (up from 9.2 billion).&lt;ref name="End of Population Growth"/&gt; However, since the world population is set to keep rising for the next few decades, this factor of the '''I=PAT''' equation will likely keep increasing [[human impact on the environment]] for the near future.

====Environmental impacts of population====
Increased population increases humans' environmental impact in many ways, which include but are not limited to:

* Increased [[land use]] - Results in habitat loss for other species.
* Increased [[resource use]] - Results in changes in land cover
* Increased [[pollution]] - Can cause sickness and damages [[ecosystem]]s.

===Affluence===
{{Main|Consumption (economics)}}

[[File:World GDP Capita 1-2003 A.D.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|right|World GDP per capita (in 1990 [[Geary-Khamis dollars]])]]

The variable '''A''', in the '''I=PAT''' equation stands for [[affluence]]. It represents the average consumption of each person in the population. As the consumption of each person increases, the total environmental impact increases as well. A common proxy for measuring consumption is through [[GDP per capita]]. While GDP per capita measures production, it is often assumed that consumption increases when production increases.  GDP per capita has been rising steadily over the last few centuries and is driving up human impact in the '''I=PAT''' equation.

====Environmental impacts of affluence====
&lt;!-- Not a great example - needs fleshing out; number of automobiles per capita would be a better example, as it changes, ... --&gt;

Increased consumption significantly increases human environmental impact. This is because each product consumed has wide-ranging effects on the environment. For example, the construction of a car has the following environmental impacts:

* 605,664 gallons of water for parts and tires&lt;ref name ="Phillis"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Andriantiatsaholiniaina | first1 = L. A. | last2 = Kouikoglou | first2 = V. S. | last3 = Phillis | first3 = Y. A. | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2003.08.009 | title = Evaluating strategies for sustainable development: Fuzzy logic reasoning and sensitivity analysis |journal = [[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]| volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 149 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 682&amp;nbsp;lbs. of pollution at a mine for the [[lead battery]].&lt;ref name ="Phillis" /&gt;
* 2178&amp;nbsp;lbs. of discharge into water supply for the 22&amp;nbsp;lbs. of copper contained in the car.&lt;ref name ="Phillis" /&gt;

The more cars per capita, the greater the impact.
Ecological impacts of each product are far reaching, increases in consumption quickly result in large impacts on the environment through direct and indirect sources.

===Technology===
{{See also|Environmental technology|Appropriate technology}}

The '''T''' variable in the '''I=PAT''' equation represents how resource intensive the production of affluence is; how much environmental impact is involved in creating, transporting and disposing of the goods, services and amenities used.  Improvements in efficiency can reduce resource intensiveness, reducing the T multiplier.  Since technology can affect environmental impact in many different ways, the unit for '''T''' is often tailored for the situation '''I=PAT''' is being applied to. For example, for a situation where the human impact on climate change is being measured, an appropriate unit for '''T''' might be greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP.

====Environmental impacts of technology====
Increases in efficiency can reduce overall environmental impact. However, since '''P''' has increased exponentially, and '''A''' has also increased drastically, the overall environmental impact, '''I''', has still increased.

==Criticism==
[[File:Native American fishing at Willamette Falls.jpg|thumb|Native American Fishing Practices (Low Technology) have a vastly smaller Impact than Industrialized Fishing]]
Criticisms of the "I=PAT" formula
* Too Simplistic for complex problem
* Inter dependencies between variables
* General sweeping assumptions of variables’ effect toward environmental impact
* Cultural differences cause wide variation in impact
* Technology cannot properly be expressed in a unit. Varying the unit will prove to be inaccurate, as the result of the calculation depends on one’s view of the situation

===Interdependencies===
The I=PAT equation has been criticized for being too simplistic by assuming that P, A, and T are independent of each other. In reality, at least 7 interdependencies between P, A, and T could exist, indicating that it is more correct to rewrite the equation as I = f(P,A,T).&lt;ref name="Alcott, B. 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alcott | first1 = B. | title = Impact caps: Why population, affluence and technology strategies should be abandoned | doi = 10.1016/j.jclepro.2009.08.001 | journal = [[Journal of Cleaner Production]] | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 552–560 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a doubling of technological efficiency, or equivalently a reduction of the T-factor by 50%, does not necessarily reduce the environmental impact (I) by 50% if efficiency induced price reductions stimulate additional consumption of the resource that was supposed to be conserved, a phenomenon called the [[rebound effect (conservation)]] or [[Jevons Paradox]].  As was shown by Alcott,&lt;ref name="Alcott, B. 2010" /&gt;{{rp|Fig. 5}} despite significant improvements in the carbon intensity of GDP (i.e., the efficiency in carbon use) since 1980, world fossil energy consumption has increased in line with economic and population growth. Similarly, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of energy and material use were almost always outpaced by economic growth, resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''],  Chapter 5, "In Search of Solutions II: Efficiency Improvements", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cleveland | first1 = C.

===Neglect of beneficial human impacts===
There have also been comments that this model depicts people as being purely detrimental to the environment, ignoring any [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]] or [[Environmental restoration|restoration]] efforts that societies have made.&lt;ref name=moseley242&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to Human-Environment Geography: Local Dynamics and Global Processes |last=Moseley |first=William |last2=Perramond |first2=Eric |last3=Hapke |first3=Holly |last4=Laris |first4=Paul |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |year=2014 |isbn=9781405189316 |location=Hoboken, NJ |pages=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neglect of political and social contexts===
Another major criticism of the I=PAT model is that it ignores the political context and decision making structures of countries and groups. This means the equation does not account for varying degrees of power, influence, and responsibility of individuals over environmental impact.&lt;ref name=moseley242/&gt; Also, the P factor does not account for the complexity of social structures or behaviors, resulting in blame being placed on the global poor.&lt;ref name=moseley242/&gt; I=PAT does not account for sustainable resource use among some poor and indigenous populations, unfairly characterizing these populations whose cultures support low impact practices.&lt;ref name=moseley242/&gt; However, the latter criticism not only assumes low impacts for indigenous populations, but also misunderstands the I=PAT equation itself. Environmental impact is a function of human numbers, affluence (ie resources consumed per capita) and technology. It is assumed that small scale societies have low environmental impacts due to their practices and orientations alone but there is little evidence to support this&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Primitive polluters : Semang impact on the Malaysian tropical rain forest ecosystem |last=Rambo |first=A. Terry |date=1985 |publisher=Museum of Anthropology, University of Michigan |isbn=0915703041 |location=Ann Arbor, Mich. |oclc=13516436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The ecological Indian : myth and history |last=Krech |first=Shepard, III |date=1999 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co |isbn=0393321002 |edition=1st |location=New York |oclc=40762824}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact the generally low impact of small scale societies compared to state societies is due to a combination of their small numbers and low level technology. Thus, the environmental sustainability of these societies is largely an epiphenomenon due their ''inability'' to significantly affect their environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Eric Alden|last2=Wishnie|first2=Mark|date=2000|title=Conservation and Subsistence in Small-Scale Societies|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.29.1.493|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=29|issue=1|pages=493–524|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.29.1.493}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hames|first=Raymond|date=2007|title=The Ecologically Noble Savage Debate|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123321|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=36|issue=1|pages=177–190 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123321}}&lt;/ref&gt;. That all types of societies are subject to I=PAT was actually made clear in Ehrlich and Holdren's 1972 dialogue with Commoner in ''The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists''&lt;ref name=BAS1/&gt; where they examine the pre-industrial (and indeed prehistoric) impact of human beings on the environment. Their position is further clarified by Holdren's 1993 paper, ''A Brief History of "IPAT"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://mahb.stanford.edu/blog/review-anthrozoology/|title=Paul Ehrlich reviews Tobias and Morrison’s most recent book –“Anthrozoology: Embracing Co-Existence in the Anthropocene” |date=2017-01-31|work=MAHB|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Policy implications===
As a result of the interdependencies between P, A, and T and potential rebound effects, policies aimed at decreasing environmental impacts through reductions in P, A, and T may not only be very difficult to implement (e.g., [[population control]] and material sufficiency and [[degrowth]] movements have been very controversial) but also are likely to be rather ineffective compared to rationing (i.e., quotas) or [[Pigovian tax|Pigouvian taxation]] of resource use or pollution.&lt;ref name="Alcott, B. 2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1791">'''Integrated catchment management''' (ICM) is a subset of [[environmental planning]] which approaches [[sustainable]] [[resource management]] from a [[Drainage basin|catchment]] perspective, in contrast to a piecemeal approach that artificially separates land management from water management.  

Integrated catchment management recognizes the existence of [[ecosystem]]s and their role in supporting flora and fauna, providing [[Ecosystem services|services]] to human societies, and regulating the human environment.  Integrated catchment management seeks to take into account complex relationships within those ecosystems: between flora and fauna, between geology and hydrology, between [[soil]]s and the [[biosphere]], and between the biosphere and the [[atmosphere]]. Integrated catchment management recognizes the cyclic nature of processes within an ecosystem, and values scientific and technical information for understanding and analysing the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Manaaki Whenua Conference 1999 Proceedings: [http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/news/conferences/manaakiwhenua/papers/bowden.asp Integrated catchment management rediscovered: an essential tool for a new millennium], William (Breck) Bowden, Landcare Research&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Langendorff heart''' or '''isolated perfused heart''' assay is a predominant ''[[in vitro]]'' technique used in pharmacological and physiological [[animal testing|research using animals]]. It allows the examination of cardiac [[Contractility|contractile strength]] and [[heart rate]] without the complications of an intact animal.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, R., Mocanu, M. &amp; Yellon, D. Retrograde heart perfusion: The Langendorff technique of isolated heart perfusion. Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology 50, 940-950 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;After 90 years this method is still being used. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Döring|first=HJ|date=1990|title=The isolated perfused heart according to Langendorff technique--function--application.|url=http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/2103635|journal=Physiologia Bohemoslovaca|language=en|volume=39|issue=6|issn=0369-9463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
In the Langendorff preparation, the [[heart]] is removed from the animal's body, severing the [[blood vessel]]s; it is then [[Retrograde perfusion|perfused]] in a reverse fashion via the [[aorta]], usually with a nutrient rich, oxygenated solution (e.g. [[Krebs–Henseleit solution]] or [[Tyrode's solution]]). The backwards pressure causes the [[aortic valve]] to shut, forcing the solution into the coronary vessels, which normally supply the heart tissue with blood. This feeds nutrients and oxygen to the cardiac muscle, allowing it to continue beating for several hours after its removal from the animal. This is a useful preparation because it allows the addition of drugs (via the perfusate) and observation of their effect on the heart without the complications involved with ''in vivo'' experimentation, such as neuronal and hormonal effects from living animal.&lt;ref&gt;The Langendorff heart preparation—Reappraisal of its role as a research and teaching model for coronary vasoactive drugs, K.J. Broadley, Journal of Pharmacological Methods&lt;/ref&gt; This preparation also allows the organ to be digested into individual cells by adding collagenase to the perfusate. This can be done before the experiment as a technique for cell harvesting, or after the experiment to measure its effects at the cellular level.

'''''Les Horribles Cernettes''''' ({{IPA-fr|le.z‿ɔʁiblə sɛʁnɛt}}, "The Horrible [[CERN]] Girls") was an all-female parody [[pop music|pop]] group, self-labelled "the one and only High Energy Rock Band", which was founded by employees of CERN and performed at CERN and other [[High-energy physics|HEP]]-related events. Their musical style is often described as [[doo-wop]]. The initials of their name, LHC, are the same as those of the [[Large Hadron Collider]], which was later built at CERN.&lt;ref name="Cernettes"&gt;

==History==
''Les Horribles Cernettes'' was founded in 1990 by Michele de Gennaro, a graphic designer at [[CERN]], whose romantic relationship with a physicist was made difficult by his numerous [[Shift work|shifts]]. She attracted attention by stepping on stage during the CERN Hardronic Festival,&lt;ref&gt;[http://musiclub.web.cern.ch/MusiClub/hardronic/hardronic2012/hardronic.html CERN Hardronic Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; singing "Collider", a melancholy song about the lonely nights endured by the girlfriend of a high energy physicist.&lt;ref name="CernettesWired"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
I gave you a golden ring to show you my love&lt;br /&gt;
You went to stick it in a printed circuit&lt;br /&gt;
To fix a voltage leak in your collector&lt;br /&gt;
You plug my feelings into your detector&lt;br /&gt;
You never spend your nights with me&lt;br /&gt;
You don't go out with other girls either&lt;br /&gt;
You only love your collider&lt;br /&gt;
Your collider.
}}

The group was subsequently formed with the help of Silvano de Gennaro, an analyst in the Computer Science department at CERN, who wrote additional songs. The fame of ''Les Horribles Cernettes'' grew and they were invited to international Physics conferences and The World '92 Expo in Seville, as well as celebrations such as [[Georges Charpak]]'s Nobel Prize party. They received press coverage from numerous newspapers, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''The Herald Tribune'', ''La Tribune de Genève'', and the ''CERN Courier''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musiclub.web.cern.ch/MusiClub/bands/cernettes/press_info.html Press Info: Press Features] Les Horribles Cernettes&lt;/ref&gt; The band's lineup has changed over time, but they were performing under the same name until 21 July 2012, when the band had its final performance, which was at CERN's Hardronic Festival in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/editorial/a-real-smash-hit A Real Smash Hit!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://musiclub.web.cern.ch/MusiClub/bands/cernettes/goodbye.html This is it!] Les Horribles Cernettes&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in 1992, after their show at the CERN Hardronic Festival, my colleague [[Tim Berners-Lee]] asked me for a few scanned photos of "the CERN girls" to publish them on some sort of information system he had just invented, called the "World Wide Web". I had only a vague idea of what that was, but I scanned some photos on my Mac and FTPed them to Tim's now famous "info.cern.ch". How was I to know that I was passing a historical milestone, as the one above was the first picture of a band ever to be clicked on in a web browser!

Silvano had taken the picture above on July 18, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9391110/How-the-first-photo-was-posted-on-the-Web-20-years-ago.html How the first photo was posted on the Web 20 years ago], Andrew Hough, The Telegraph, 11 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The band went into hiatus when Silvano and Michele moved away from the CERN area and officially disbanded in late July 2012, after performing at the CERN Hardronic Festival on the 21st.{{citation needed|date = September 2014}} However, [[Lynn Veronneau]] has since embarked upon a serious solo career, recording French language versions of popular standards.{{citation needed|date = May 2015}}

On July 15, 2017, and in celebration of their 25th anniversary (of their historic exposure on the World Wide Web), the original members performed for a one-time only concert in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/first-internet-photo-features-sherbrooke-woman-1.4206913 "Was this the 1st photo on the web? 25 years on, Quebec woman tells how she came to be in it"] from CBC (July 15, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cape Canaveral]] and adjacent [[Merritt Island, Florida|Merritt Island]] on [[Florida]]'s [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast are home to two [[United States|American]] [[spaceport]]s, one civilian and one military, servicing several active [[launch site]]s.

==John F. Kennedy Space Center==
The civilian [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]], operated by [[NASA]], has one launch complex with two pads on Merritt Island. From 1968&amp;ndash;1975, it was the site of 13 [[Saturn V]] launches, three manned [[Skylab]] flights and the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]; all [[Space Shuttle]] flights from 1981–2011, and one [[Ares 1-X]] flight in 2009.

==Cape Canaveral Air Force Station==
The military [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] (CCAFS), operated by the [[45th Space Wing]] of the [[U.S. Air Force]], was the site of all U.S. manned launches before [[Apollo 8]], as well as many other early [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) and NASA launches. For the DoD, it plays a secondary role to [[Vandenberg AFB]] in [[California]], but is the launch site for many NASA unmanned [[space probe]]s, as those spacecraft are typically launched on [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] launchers. Active launch vehicles are in '''bold'''.

Much of the support activity for CCAFS occurs at [[Patrick Air Force Base]] to the south, its reporting base.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1653">'''MAXI J1659-152''' is a rapidly rotating [[black-hole]]/star system, discovered by [[NASA]]'s Swift space telescope on September 25, 2010. On March 19, 2013, [[ESA]]'s XMM-Newton space telescope has helped to identify a star and a black hole that orbit each other at the rate of once every 2.4 hours.

The black hole and the [[star]] orbit their common center of mass. Because the star is the lighter object, it lies farther from this point and has to "travel around its larger [[orbit]] at a breakneck speed of two million kilometers per hour", 500 to 600&amp;nbsp;km/s, or about 20 times Earth's orbital velocity. The star was the fastest moving star ever seen in an X-ray [[binary system]] until the recent discovery of system 47 Tuc X9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencealert.com/astronomers-just-found-a-star-orbiting-a-black-hole-at-1-percent-the-speed-of-light Astronomers Just Found a Star Orbiting a Black Hole at 1 Percent the Speed of Light (2017)]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the black hole orbits at 'only' {{val|150000|u=km/h}}.

The black hole in this compact pairing is at least three times more massive than the [[Sun]], while its [[red dwarf]] companion star has a [[mass]] only 20% that of the Sun. The pair is separated by roughly a million kilometers – for comparison the distance to the Sun from Earth is about 150 million kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Black_hole-star_pair_orbiting_at_dizzying_speed MAXI J1659-152: The shortest orbital period black-hole transient in outburst (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Nature of Man Series''''' is a four-volume series of works in [[paleoanthropology]] by the prolific playwright, screenwriter, and science writer [[Robert Ardrey]]. The books in the series were published between 1961 and 1976.

The series majorly undermined standing assumptions in social sciences, leading to an abandonment of the "[[tabula rasa|blank slate]]" hypothesis; incited a renaissance in the science of [[ethology]]; and led to widespread popular interest in [[human evolution]] and [[Anthropogeny|human origins]].

The first work, ''[[African Genesis]]'' (1961), particularly helped revive interest in ethology, and was a direct precursor to the [[Konrad Lorenz]]'s ''[[On Aggression]]'' (1966), [[Desmond Morris]]'s ''[[The Naked Ape]]'' (1967), [[Lionel Tiger]]'s ''Men in Groups'' (1969), and Tiger and [[Robin Fox]]'s ''The Imperial Animal'' (1971). The director of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History#Hall of Human Origins|Human Origins Program]] [[Rick Potts]], cited Ardrey's work as inspiring him to go anthropology.&lt;ref name="Anthronotes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anthropology.si.edu/outreach/anthnote/Summer99/anthnote.html |title=Human Origins: One Man's Search for the Causes in Time |last=Selig | first=Ruth Osterweis |publisher= Smithsonian Institution |date=Spring–Summer 1999 |website=Anthronotes |access-date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The works were wildly popular and influenced the public imagination. Stanley Kubrick cited them as major influences in developing his films [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001: A Space Odyssey'']] (1968) and [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|''A Clockwork Orange'']] (1971).&lt;ref name=Kubrick&gt;Kubrick, Stanley.

Clarke]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robert Ardrey==
{{main article|Robert Ardrey}}
Robert Ardrey was a prolific [[playwright]], [[screenwriter]], and [[science writing|science writer]]. By the time he returned to the sciences in the 1950s, he had already had a decorated [[Hollywood]] and [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] career, including the award of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]&lt;ref name="About"&gt;The Robert Ardrey Estate Website. [http://www.robertardrey.com/about/ "About"]&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Academy Award]] nomination for best screenplay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{IMDb title | 0060588 | ''Khartoum''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Ardrey travelled to [[Africa]], where he wrote a series of articles for [[The Reporter (magazine)|''The Reporter'']].&lt;ref name="Education"&gt;Ardrey, Robert; Ardrey, Daniel (ed.). "The Education of Robert Ardrey: An Autobiography" (unpublished manuscript ca. 1980, available through Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}} At the same time he renewed an acquaintance with prominent geologist [[Richard Foster Flint]] and investigated claims made by [[Raymond Dart]] about a specimen of ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]''.&lt;ref name="Education" /&gt;{{rp|119}} This trip would initiate the decades of work Ardrey completed in the field of human evolution.

==African Genesis (1961)==
{{main article|African Genesis}}
The central thesis of ''African Genesis: A Personal Investigation into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man'' was that early man evolved from carnivorous African predecessors, and not, as was then the scientific consensus, from Asian herbivores.&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;Ardrey, Robert. ''African Genesis: A Personal Investigation into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man.'' New York: Atheneum. 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AGkindle"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/African-Genesis-Personal-Investigation-Origins/dp/0988604302 Kindle Edition Description via Amazon Website]&lt;/ref&gt; It drew particularly on the scientific work of [[Raymond Dart]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]]. This thesis has been proven and is now scientific doctrine.{{Citation needed|date = July 2015}}

''African Genesis'' also challenged a key methodological assumption of the social sciences, namely that human behavior was distinct from animal behavior. Ardrey instead asserted that evolutionarily inherited traits were a major factor in determining human behavior. This was a hugely controversial hypothesis, though it has gained widespread acceptance today. It was a major theme that would extend throughout the ''Nature of Man'' books and continue to surround them with controversy.

''African Genesis'' was a major popular success. It was an international bestseller translated into dozens of languages.&lt;ref name="Dawkins, Richard 2014"&gt;Dawkins, Richard. ''Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist.'' 2014. New York: Ecco. Print&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 it was a finalist for the [[National Book Award]] in nonfiction.&lt;ref&gt;Via the National Book Award [https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1962 website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine named ''African Genesis'' the most notable nonfiction book of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941837,00.html ''Time" Friday, Dec. 26, 1969. List accessible online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Territorial Imperative (1966)==
{{main article|The Territorial Imperative}}
''The Territorial Imperative: A Personal Inquiry Into the Animal Origins of Property and Nations'' extends Ardrey's work in examining the effects of inherited evolutionary traits on human social behavior with an emphasis on the hold that territory has on man. In particular it demonstrates the influence of the drive to possess territory on such phenomena as property ownership and nation-building.&lt;ref name=ditext&gt;{{cite web| title=The Territorial Imperative| publisher=Digital Text International| accessdate=2012-03-24| url=http://www.ditext.com/ardrey/imperative/imperative.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Territorial Imperative'' further developed the nascent science of [[ethology]] and increased public interest in human origins.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;Hunt, George P. "Provocateur in Anthropology." ''Time'' 26 August 1966: 2. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeSept70Q"&gt;Graves, Ralph. "A 'Scientific Amateur' Expands his Territory." ''Time'' 11 September 1970: 1. Print: "Both of these books enjoyed, along with the scientific uproar they created, a wide general readership, and Ardrey, who describes himself as a 'scientific amateur,' today can claim major credit for having introduced the public to the new field of ethology, the study of animal behavior and its relationship to man."&lt;/ref&gt;

Like ''African Genesis'' it was also an international bestseller and saw translation into dozens of languages.&lt;ref name="Dawkins, Richard 2014"/&gt; It influenced several notable figures. [[Stanley Kubrick]] cited Ardrey as an inspiration for his films ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''.&lt;ref name="KubrickClarkeErlichMiamiU"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.users.muohio.edu/erlichrd/350/odyssey.php |title= Strange Odyssey: From Dart to Ardrey to Kubrick and Clarke |author= Richard D. Erlich|work= [[English studies]]/[[Film theory]] course, [[Science fiction]] and [[Film]] |publisher= [[Miami University]] |date= 1997–2005 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RichterMoonwatcher"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/c/arthur-c-clarke/moonwatchers-memoir.htm |title= ''Moonwatcher's Memoir: A Diary of 2001, a Space Odyssey'' |author= [[Daniel Richter (actor)|Daniel Richter]] |location= [[New York City]] |publisher=[[Carroll &amp; Graf]]  |isbn=978-0-7867-1073-7 |year= 2002 }} (From the [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0099.html Foreword] by [[Arthur C. Clarke]].)&lt;/ref&gt; The strategic analyst [[Andrew Marshall (foreign policy strategist)|Andrew Marshall]] and U.S. Secretary of Defense [[James Schlesinger]] are known to have discussed ''The Territorial Imperative'' in connection to military-strategic thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Somit, Albert. et. al. ''Human Nature and Public Policy: An Evolutionary Approach.'' 2003. Palgrave Macmillan. P. 24. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Social Contract (1970)==
{{main article|The Social Contract (1970 book)}}
''The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder'' is the most controversial book of the ''Nature of Man'' series.&lt;ref name=Sci2&gt;Davis, Steve. "The Richard Dawkins Dilemma - Illusions of Natural Selection." From Science 2.0. Posted 15 September 2008. Retrieved 18 July 2015. Available [http://www.science20.com/gadfly/blog/richard_dawkins_dilemma_illusions_natural_selection-32425 here].&lt;/ref&gt; It sought to apply evolutionary thinking to the creation of social order. In particular it examined inherited characteristics' effects in determining hierarchy and inequality.&lt;ref name=SC&gt;Ardrey, Robert. ''The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder.'' New York: Atheneum. 1970. 405 pp. Print&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Humans&gt;Stade, George. "Humans Act, Animals Behave: The Social Contract." ''The New York Times,'' 22 November 1970. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Ardrey argued that, while inequality was not necessarily a social evil, it could only be justly expressed under conditions of absolute equality of opportunity. He also argued that the presence of inequality does not justify the domination of the weak by the strong.&lt;ref name=Sci2 /&gt; "Ardrey showed that in all societies at any level of the animal world, structures exist to protect the vulnerable, and that this is an evolutionary advantage as it protects diversity, diversity being essential for creativity."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Steve. "[http://www.science20.com/gadfly/blog/richard_dawkins_dilemma_illusions_natural_selection-32425 here The Richard Dawkins Dilemma - Illusions of Natural Selection]". From Science 2.0. Posted 15 September 2008. Retrieved 18 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Social Contract'' continued Ardrey's refutation of cultural determinists through interwoven analyses of animal and human behavior. It also emphasized the importance of a reasoned respect for nature, foreshadowing the environmental concerns of ''The Hunting Hypothesis.''&lt;ref&gt;"The philosophy of the impossible has been the dominant motive in human affairs for the past two centuries. We have pursued the mastery of nature as if we ourselves were not a portion of that nature. We have boasted of our command over our physical environment while we ourselves have done our urgent best to destroy it." Ardrey, Robert (2014-05-15). The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder (Robert Ardrey's Nature of Man series) (Kindle Locations 47-49). StoryDesign LTD.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hunting Hypothesis (1976)==
{{main article|The Hunting Hypothesis}}
''The Hunting Hypothesis: A Personal Conclusion Concerning the Evolutionary Nature of Man'' continued Ardrey's examination of the importance of inherited evolutionary traits. In particular it demonstrated the determinant force of traits that co-evolved in early man with hunting behavior.

At the time of publication, it was not even commonly accepted that early man were hunters, much less that hunting behavior influenced their evolution.&lt;ref&gt;"In Search of Human Origins Part Two." ''NOVA.'' Public Broadcasting Corporation. 10 June 1997. Transcript available [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2107hum2.html here].&lt;/ref&gt; Following publication of Ardrey's work this thesis gained support and eventually widespread acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;"Becoming Human Part 2." ''NOVA.'' Public Broadcasting Corporation. 31, August, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;"For decades researchers have been locked in debate over how and when hunting began and how big a role it played in human evolution. Recent analyses of human anatomy, stone tools and animal bones are helping to fill in the details of this game-changing shift in subsistence strategy. This evidence indicates that hunting evolved far earlier than some scholars had envisioned – and profoundly impacted subsequent human evolution."&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Kate. "[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-hunting-made-us-human/ How Hunting Made Us Human]". ''Scientific American,'' Volume 310, Issue 4. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hunting Hypothesis'' was also one of the first books to warn about [[climate change]] as a possible existential threat to mankind.&lt;ref name=Turnbull&gt;Turnbull, Colin M. "Just out of the Jungle: Hunting Hypothesis." ''The New York Times,'' 23 May 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hunting Hypothesis,'' with some exceptions, was remarkably well reviewed. The famed biologist and naturalist [[E. O. Wilson]], the noted anthropologist [[Colin Turnbull]], the acclaimed journalist [[Max Lerner]], and the noteworthy social scientist [[Roger Masters]], among others, all wrote effusive reviews.&lt;ref name=Turnbull&gt;Turnbull, Colin M. "Just out of the Jungle: Hunting Hypothesis." ''The New York Times,'' 23 May 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edward O. Quoted in "Professional Comments on Robert Ardrey's ''The Hunting Hypothesis.''" Available through Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, Max. Quoted in "Professional Comments on Robert Ardrey's ''The Hunting Hypothesis.''" Available through Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Masters, Roger D. Quoted in "Professional Comments on Robert Ardrey's ''The Hunting Hypothesis.''" Available through Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antony Jay]] wrote that "Robert Ardrey's books are the most important to be written since the war and arguable in the 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Antony. Quoted in "Professional Comments on Robert Ardrey's ''The Hunting Hypothesis.''" Available through Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Night combat''' is [[combat]] that occurs during the hours of darkness.  It is distinguished from daytime combat by lower visibility and its reversed relation to the [[Circadian cycle]].  Typically combat at night is favorable to the attacker, with offensive tactics being focused on exploiting the advantages to maximum effect.&lt;ref name="NCBRC"&gt;[http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ntcombat/index.html NIGHT COMBAT BY RUSSIAN CAVALRY]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toppe"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zW63yXqltbEC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=night+combat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ncBHnD-qS0&amp;sig=sT1_TdCa8WT9bpP8vLxEeD43k_4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=H9n7SvWXKoHiswPBioB5&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Night Combat]&lt;/ref&gt;  Defensive night tactics mainly focus on negating the advantages given by the night to the attacker.&lt;ref name="morris"&gt;[http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/morris/morris.asp#7 Night Combat Operations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of night==
The most obvious effect of darkness is reduced [[visibility]].  This affects a soldier's ability to observe friendly troop movements, understand terrain, and especially affects perception of enemy movements and position.  Officers find that darkness hampers many aspects of command, including their ability to preserve control, execute movement, firing, maintenance of direction, reconnaissance, security, and mutual support. A [[U.S. Army]] report on historic Japanese warfare described an instance of this confusion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An example is recorded in the history of Japan when about 1180 a force[sic] of the Heike confronting a force of the Genji across the Fuji river (Shizuoka Prefecture) beat a hasty retreat one night due to mistaking the noise made by water fowl for an attacking Genji force.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Indeed, a side effect of the reduced visibility is heightened audibility, as soldiers focus more on what they can hear.  There are many instances of soldiers losing their bearings at night due to flashes from guns or enemy searchlights.&lt;ref name="Japanese Principles of Night Combat"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/33825657/Japanese-Night-Combat-Part-1-Principles-of-Night-Combat-USA-1955 Eight United States Army Military History Section: Japanese Research Division]&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulties of perception lend themselves to fear of the unknown.  Soldiers under fire can't tell where the fire originates and can't devise appropriate countermeasures.  Such uncertainty is associated with feelings of loneliness and helplessness, and creates a tendency to over estimate enemy strength or be excessively pessimistic of the combat situation.&lt;ref name="Japanese Principles of Night Combat" /&gt;

In addition, without the aid of artificial illumination, a soldier's marksmanship skills are negatively affected in total darkness. "Prior to the introduction of aided night vision devices, effective firing at night with a rifle was limited to very close distances, typically within 50 meters. The ability to hit targets was dependant upon a soldiers ability to acquire targets in their sights, which in turn, depended greatly upon the amount of natural and artificial illumination." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a297284.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Night operations have been subject to vast shifts in effectiveness and frequency throughout history, as tactics and technology became more sophisticated.

===Classical antiquity===
Night fighting between [[Standing army|standing armies]] was rare in ancient times.  Night logistics were mostly limited to the carrying of torches, or navigation by what little light was provided by the stars or moon.  However, circumstances occasionally necessitated fighting at night.  Usually due to the massive nature of the battles, they could not be resolved in one day, and combat could not be cleanly disengaged as darkness fell, or prevented as armies camped near each other overnight.{{original research inline|date=July 2016}} [[Sieges]] which lasted for weeks, months or, even years were often fought day and night. Below are a few notable examples.

Ancient historian [[Diodorus]] claims that at the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] the Spartans attempted to assassinate Persian King [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] by infiltrating his camp at night.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"They immediately seized their arms, and six hundred men rushed into the camp of five hundred thousand, making directly for the king's tent, and resolving either to die with him, or, if they should be overpowered, at least in his quarters. An alarm spread through the whole Persian army. The Spartans being unable to find the king, marched uncontrolled through the whole camp, killing and overthrowing all that stood in their way, like men who knew that they fought, not with the hope of victory, but to avenge their own deaths. The contest was protracted from the beginning of the night through the greater part of the following day. At last, not conquered, but exhausted with conquering, they fell amidst vast heaps of slaughtered enemies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/warsbattles/a/Thermopylae.htm Diodorus on the Battle of Thermopylae]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], over a period of 3 days, an alliance of Germanic tribes wore down and eventually annihilated 3 Roman legions (about 16,000 to 20,000 men).  The Romans attempted several defensive night tactics.  On the first night they managed to erect a fortified camp.  On the second night, they marched at night in an attempt to break through the encircling Germanic forces, but the Germans had already built a wall in their way, and when combat resumed the following day, the Romans were defeated.

The [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]] saw exceptional chaos caused by nightfall.  The night before the battle proper, one of the Roman allied forces stumbled on a band of Hunnic troops and in the resulting skirmish, as many as 30,000 (unverified) men were killed.  Later in the battle,  [[Thorismund]], son of king [[Theodoric I|Theodoric]], accidentally walked into [[Attila the Hun]]'s encampment while attempting to return to his own forces at night.  He was wounded in the ensuing mêlée before his followers could rescue him and withdraw.  That same night, the Roman commander [[Flavius Aëtius]] became separated from his men and, believing that disaster had befallen them, had to stay the night with his Germanic allies.

===Middle Ages===
[[The Night Attack]] of [[Târgovişte]] pitted [[Vlad The Impaler]] of [[Wallachia]] against [[Mehmed II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].  Vlad reportedly disguised himself as a Turk and walked freely throughout the Ottoman camp in an effort to find the Mehmed's tent and learn about the organization of his army.  One chronicle of the battle says that Mehmed disallowed his troops to exit their tents so as not to cause a panic in case of an attack.  According to that chronicle, Vlad learned of this and planned his attack at night knowing that the enemy soldiers would have to remain in their tents.  Accounts of the battle and its casualties are mixed, but in the end it was a Wallachian victory, with around 5000 Wallachian casualties compared to around 15,000 for the Ottomans.

===World War I===
The adoption of illumination rounds led to an improvement in the ability to carry out night operations. These projectiles were fired from howitzers and field guns in the direction their light was required. The first illumination rounds (also called [[Shell (projectile)|starshell]]) were modified shrapnel shells which ejected magnesium pellets. These were somewhat ineffective, and were soon replaced by improved designs that had greater candle power, and a parachute to prolong the descent to ground. Tracer ammunition was also introduced during World War I. Tracers made marksmanship at night easier for soldiers, because they could observe the trajectory of their shots and correct their aim accordingly.

===World War II===
{{see also|Night fighter}}
Night continued to have a significant impact on combat during [[World War II]]. Particularly in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]], the Japanese military was proficient in night warfare, as acknowledged by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. In anticipation of a conflict with the Soviet Union, whose numbers of tanks, planes, and artillery were vastly superior, the Japanese developed a series of training manuals designed to counter these advantages. The "Red Books" (classified materials bound in red paper) emphasized the advantages of attacking at night, in the evening, and at dawn. These tactics later proved useful against the Allies who were similarly better equipped.

The Japanese used this advantage to win engagements where they were severely outnumbered in China and against the Allies at sea. It wasn't until late in the war that early warning technologies of the Allies subverted their surprise attacks at night, reducing their effectiveness. These tactics completely broke down once the Japanese military replaced their well trained troops with hastily trained recruits.&lt;ref name="Japanese Principles of Night Combat" /&gt; The [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS ''Enterprise'' (CV-6)]] was the first [[aircraft carrier]] in the [[U.S. Navy]] that carried out night strike operations. It received the new designation (CV(N)-6), the "N" standing for "Night", to indicate this capability.

Another type of illumination device was the [[tripflare]]. This consisted of a pyrotechnic instrument activated by a tripwire, which was planted near trails to provide early warning of enemy movement. By 1944, the Wehrmacht was making extensive use of tripflares in Italy, after their perimeters had been repeatedly infiltrated at night by U.S. Army Rangers. Tripflares helped foil an attack launched by the [[United States Army North|Fifth Army]] on January 20 at the Rapido Rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=World War II River Assault Tactics |year=2013 |publisher=Osprey |isbn=9781780961088 |pages=59 |author=Gordon L. Rottman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-World War II===
In the [[First Battle of al-Faw]] in late stages of the [[Iran–Iraq War]], one of the elements contributed to the success of Iranians was their using of dug in infantry which would move only at night and during poor weather, which reduced the Iraqis' advantage in armor. The Iranian forces had been trained in night warfare prior to the battle.

==Tactics==
Perhaps the most important deciding factor in a battle at night is preparation.  This includes [[Military education and training|training]], [[Reconnaissance#Military reconnaissance|reconnaissance]], and [[Military operation plan|planning]].  As with any military operation, leadership is important in both the high-ranking officers and the low-level squad and unit leaders.&lt;ref name="morris"/&gt;

===Offensive tactics===
The decision to engage at night or continue an engagement at night is usually made by the attacking force.  Combat continued at night is aimed at exploiting an advantage gained from an attack during the day or similarly denying the defending force the opportunity to regroup or reinforce.  Combat initiated at night can either be aimed to gain an advantage (such as territory or prisoners) which is then held during the following day or to harass and demoralize the enemy before disengaging prior to sunrise.  The latter case is considered a [[Raid (military)|raid]].

Historically, night combat involves greater risk and reward compared to similar battles in the day time.  Victories can be crushing, with the defending side taken completely by surprise and hardly a shot fired in response to an attack.  Alternatively, defeats can be disastrous with huge casualties resulting from attacking armies floundering around chaotically while they themselves are ambushed in pitch darkness.

It shows the month ring on the outside in brass. The silver coloured inner disk shows the time and has an indicator on one edge. By setting the indicator to the month and day (in this case, a few days into October), centring Polaris in the hole in the middle and rotating the pointer attached to the centre to a specified circumpolar star, the arm indicates the time (in this case, 8 pm).]]
A '''nocturnal''' is an [[Mathematical instrument|instrument]] used to determine the local time based on the relative [[star position|position]]s of two or more [[star]]s in the [[night sky]]. Sometimes called a ''horologium nocturnum'' (time instrument for night) or ''nocturlabe'' (in French and occasionally used by English writers), it is related to the [[astrolabe]] and [[sundial]]. Knowing the time is important in [[piloting (navigation)|piloting]] for calculating [[tide]]s and some nocturnals incorporate [[tide table|tide chart]]s for important ports.

Even if the nightly course of the stars has been known since antiquity, mentions of a dedicated instrument for its measurement are not found before the Middle Ages. The earliest image presenting the use of a nocturnal is in a manuscript dated from the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Farre"&gt;Farre i Olive E., (1996): ''La Sphaera Horarum Noctis de Ramon Llull'', "La Busca de Paper" n. 22, Primavera, p. 3-12 (edicion bilingue)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond Lull]] repeatedly described the use of a ''sphaera horarum noctis'' or ''astrolabium nocturnum''.&lt;ref&gt;Raimon Lull, ''Liber Principorum medicinae'' in ''Opera omnia'', vol.1, Chap. 36, par.30, Mainz, 1721; Earlier Lull mentions the nocturnal in his ''Nova geometria'' (1299).&lt;/ref&gt;

With  [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]]'s  book ''Arte de Navegar'', published in 1551 the name and the instrument gained a larger popularity.&lt;ref name="wynter"&gt;Harriet Wynter and Anthony Turner, ''Scientific Instruments'', Studio Vista, 1975,  {{ISBN|0-289-70403-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was described also c. 1530 by [[Petrus Apianus]] in his ''Cosmographicus Liber'', republished later by [[Gemma Frisius]] with a widely circulated illustration of the instrument while being used by an observer.

==Construction==
[[Image:Nocturlabe Vienne IMG 8668.jpg|thumb|A nocturnal made in Vienna.]]
Nocturnals have been most commonly constructed of [[wood]] or [[brass]].

A nocturnal will have an outer disc marked with the months of the year, and an inner disc marked with hours (and perhaps half hours, or quarter hours on the largest instruments) as well as locations for one or more reference stars. It will also have a pointer rotating on the same axis as the discs, sometimes extended beyond the rim. The axis, or pivot point, must be such that a star can be sighted through it; usually a hollow rivet is used. Since the instrument is used at night, markings may be exaggerated or raised. Often the inner disc has a diagram of the necessary constellations and stars, to aid in locating them.

==Usage==
[[File:Nocturnal howto.svg|thumb|320px|right|Operating scheme of a nocturnal.]]
A nocturnal is a simple [[analog computer]], made of two or more dials, that will provide the local time based on the time of year and a sighting of [[Polaris]], the North Star, and one or more other stars. In the [[northern hemisphere]], all stars will appear to rotate about the North Star during the night, and their positions, like the progress of the [[sun]], can be used to determine the time. The positions of the stars will change based on the time of year.

The most commonly used reference stars are the pointer stars from the [[Big Dipper]] ([[Ursa Major]]) or [[Kochab]] from the [[Little Dipper]] (Ursa Minor). The star [[Schedar]] in [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] may also be used, since it is on the opposite side of the sky from Ursa Major.

The inner disc is rotated so that the mark for the chosen reference star points to the current date on the outer disc. The north star is sighted through the center of the device, and the pointer arm is rotated to point at the chosen reference star. The intersection of the pointer arm with the hour markings on the inner disc indicates the time. The instrument must be held upright, and should have a handle or similar hint as to which direction is down.

It is not possible to convert the local time to a standard time such as [[UTC]] without accurate knowledge of the observer's [[longitude]]. Similarly, it is not possible to determine longitude unless the observer also knows the standard time from a [[Chronometer watch|chronometer]].

==History==
''Nova'' was created on March 3, 1974, by Michael Ambrosino, inspired by the [[BBC Two|BBC 2]] television series ''[[Horizon (UK TV series)|Horizon]]'', which Ambrosino had seen while working in the UK.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the early years, many ''Nova'' episodes were either co-productions with the BBC ''Horizon'' team, or other documentaries originating outside of the United States, with the narration re-voiced in [[American English]]. Of the first 50 programs, only 19 were original [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] productions, and the very first ''Nova'' episode, "The Making of a Natural History Film", was originally an episode of ''Horizon'' that premiered in 1972.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.current.org/doc/doc808nova.html | title = Ambrosino and Nova: making stories that go 'bang' | accessdate = 2008-03-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090306090930/http://www.current.org/doc/doc808nova.html | archivedate = 2009-03-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice continues to this day. All the producers and associate producers for the original ''Nova'' teams came from either England (with experience on the ''Horizon'' series), Los Angeles or New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wgbhalumni.org/essays/1970s-nova.html  | title = NOVA: From the Beginning (1970s) | accessdate = 2008-03-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071005120646/http://www.wgbhalumni.org/essays/1970s-nova.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambrosino was succeeded as executive producer by John Angier, John Mansfield, and [[Paula S.

==''Decoding the Weather Machine''==
Broadcast April 18, 2018
[[Astrophysicist]] [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] reviewed ''Decoding the Weather Machine'' for ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' magazine describing the presentation of the documentary as "logical and factual". The majority of the film stresses the impact of climate change on the earth and society. NOVA uses a novel approach with half the scientists being female and young. Climatologist [[Katherine Hayhoe]] is prominent. Morrison states that the film uses data to prove that climate change is real and has a "demonstrable impact on ecosystems and people". Morrison hopes that this film convinces the public who are uncertain about the science of climate change.&lt;ref name="Morrison 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morrison |first1=David |authorlink=David Morrison (astrophysicist)|title=Climate Fundamentals: NOVA's 'Decoding the Weather Machine' |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=5 |page=61 |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''open-access monograph''' is a scholarly [[monograph]] which is made freely available with a [[Creative Commons Licence|creative commons licence.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Budapest Open Access Initiative  {{!}} Budapest Open Access Initiative|url = http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/|website = www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Open access is when academic research is made freely available for anyone to read and re-use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities|url=http://openaccess.mpg.de/286432/Berlin-Declaration|website=Max Planck Open Access|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with [[open access journals]], there are different [[business models]] for funding open-access books, including [[Article processing charge|publication charges]], institutional support, [[library publishing]], and consortium models.&lt;ref name=insights&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferwerda|first1=Eelco|title=Open access monograph business models|journal=Insights|date=2014|volume=27|doi=10.1629/2048-7754.118|url=http://uksg.metapress.com/content/e17587x1kn27p705/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2014|issn=2048-7754}}&lt;/ref&gt; OECD Publishing uses a [[freemium]] model by making its books available online in HTML with the option to purchase a print copy.&lt;ref name=insights /&gt; There is some evidence that making electronic editions of books open access can increase sales of the print edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suber|first1=Peter|title=Open access|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Open_Access_(the_book)|date=2012|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262517638|page=107|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While open access to journal articles has become very common, with 50% of articles published in 2011 available as open access,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Archambault|first1=Eric|last2=Amyot|first2=Didier|last3=Deschamps|first3=Philippe|last4=Nicol,|first4=Aurore|last5=Rebout|first5=Lise|last6=Roberge|first6=Guillaume|title=Proportion of Open Access Peer-Reviewed Papers at the European and World Levels—2004-2011|url=http://www.science-metrix.com/pdf/SM_EC_OA_Availability_2004-2011.pdf|accessdate=4 June 2014|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; open access to books has not yet seen as much uptake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Ellen|last2=Milloy|first2=Caren|title=A snapshot of attitudes towards open access monograph publishing in the humanities and social sciences – part of the OAPEN-UK project|journal=Insights|date=2012|volume=25|issue=2|doi=10.1629/2048-7754.25.2.192|url=http://uksg.metapress.com/content/727t2j1u17uvgnt2/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are dedicated open-access book publishers such as [[Open Book Publishers]] and others who publish both books and journals, such as [[Open Humanities Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bonn|first1=Maria|title=Free exchange of ideas Experimenting with the open access monograph|url=http://crln.acrl.org/content/71/8/436.short|website=College &amp; Research Libraries News|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report released in 2015 by the UK's main funding body for research, the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]], states the importance of open access monographs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monographs and open access: A report to HEFCE|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/hefce/content/pubs/indirreports/2015/Monographs,and,open,access/2014_monographs.pdf|accessdate=21 August 2015|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Monographs are a vitally important and distinctive vehicle for research communication, and must be sustained in any moves to open access."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monographs and open access|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/rereports/year/2015/monographs/|accessdate=21 August 2015|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4674">'''(Positive) Rheotaxis''' is a form of [[taxis]] seen in  many aquatic organisms, e.g., [[fish]], whereby they will (generally) turn to face into an oncoming [[current (stream)|current]].  In a flowing [[stream]], this behavior leads them to hold position in a stream rather than being swept downstream by the current. Rheotaxis has been noted in [[zebrafish]] and other species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A novel mechanism for mechanosensory-based rheotaxis in larval zebrafish|first1=Pablo |last1=Oteiza|first2= Iris |last2=Odstrcil|first3= George |last3=Lauder|first4=Ruben |last4=Portugues |first5= Florian|last5= Engert|journal=Nature|volume=547|issue=7664 |pages=445–448|pmid=28700578 |pmc=5873946 |year=2017 |doi=10.1038/nature23014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is found in most major [[aquatic invertebrate]] groups.

In fish that exhibit rheotaxis, it can easily be demonstrated by creating an artificial current within a tank using [[pump]]s. No matter which way the pumps force the current to flow, the fish will immediately turn to face the oncoming current.

Some organisms such as eels will exhibit '''negative rheotaxis''' where they will avoid currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Swimming activity and behaviour of European Anguilla anguilla glass eels in response to photoperiod and flow reversal and the role of energy status.|last1=Du Colombier |first1=SB|last2= Bolliet |first2=V|last3= Bardonnet |first3=A|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|volume=74|issue=9|pages=2002–13 |pmid=20735685|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2009.02269.x|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[zooplankton]] also exhibit positive or negative rheotaxis.

In rheotaxis, the [[Lateral line|'''lateral line system''']] is used by the animal to determine changes in the oncoming flow pattern of a body of water, which may occur due to the presence of objects such as predator and prey, and the corresponding orientation of the animal toward or away from the current.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Erika E.

Pure rheotaxis is the form in which the only stimulus for orienting is the current itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kobayashi|first=Donald R.|last2=Farman|first2=Richard|last3=Polovina|first3=Jeffrey J.|last4=Parker|first4=Denise M.|last5=Rice|first5=Marc|last6=Balazs|first6=George H.|date=2014-08-06|title="Going with the Flow" or Not: Evidence of Positive Rheotaxis in Oceanic Juvenile Loggerhead Turtles (Caretta caretta) in the South Pacific Ocean Using Satellite Tags and Ocean Circulation Data|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=9|issue=8|pages=e103701|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0103701|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4123884|pmid=25098694}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals can also use rheotaxis in conjunction with other methods to orient themselves in the water.

The safety of high energy particle collisions was a topic of widespread discussion and topical interest during the time when the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] (RHIC) and later the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC)—currently the world's largest and most powerful [[particle accelerator]]—were being constructed and commissioned. Concerns arose that such high energy experiments—designed to produce novel particles and forms of matter—had the potential to create harmful states of matter or even [[doomsday event|doomsday scenario]]s. Claims escalated as commissioning of the LHC drew closer, around 2008–2010. The claimed dangers included the production of stable [[micro black hole]]s and the creation of hypothetical particles called [[strangelet]]s,&lt;ref name="CosmicLog-August 19, 2008"/&gt; and these questions were explored in the media, on the Internet and at times through the courts.

To address these concerns in the context of the LHC, CERN mandated a group of independent scientists to review these scenarios. In a report issued in 2003, they concluded that, like current particle experiments such as the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] (RHIC), the LHC particle collisions pose no conceivable threat.&lt;ref name="2003SafetyReport"&gt;Blaizot JP, [[John Iliopoulos|Iliopoulos J]], Madsen J, Ross GG, Sonderegger P, Specht HJ (2003). ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20080907004852/http://doc.cern.ch/yellowrep/2003/2003-001/p1.pdf Study of Potentially Dangerous Events During Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC]'' (PDF, 176 [[KiB]]). CERN. Geneva. [http://cdsweb.cern.ch/search?sysno=002372601cer CERN-2003-001].&lt;/ref&gt; A second review of the evidence commissioned by CERN was released in 2008.

The report ruled out any doomsday scenario at the LHC, noting that the physical conditions and collision events which exist in the LHC, RHIC and other experiments occur naturally and routinely in the [[universe]] without hazardous consequences,&lt;ref name="LSAGreport"/&gt; including [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s observed to impact Earth with energies far higher than those in any man-made collider.

==Background==
[[Image:Construction of LHC at CERN.jpg|upright|thumb|The LHC's [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]] detector.]]
{{main|Particle collider|Large Hadron Collider}}
[[Particle collider]]s are a type of [[particle accelerator]] used by physicists as a research tool to understand fundamental aspects of the universe. Their operation involves directed beams of [[elementary particle|particles]] accelerated to very high [[kinetic energy]] and allowed to collide;  analysis of the byproducts of these collisions gives scientists good evidence of the structure of the subatomic world and the laws of nature governing it. These may become apparent only at high energies and for tiny periods of time, and therefore may be hard or impossible to study in other ways.

Because of the high energy levels involved, concerns have arisen at times in the public arena as to whether such collisions are safe, or whether they might, by reason of their extreme energy, trigger unforeseen problems or consequences.

=== Examples of colliders ===
Concerns were noted during the construction of the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC), which began operations in 2008, is the world's largest and highest-energy [[particle accelerator]] complex, intended to [[Collider|collide]] opposing [[Charged particle beam|beams]] of either [[proton]]s or [[lead]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] with very high [[kinetic energy]].&lt;ref name="LHCbooklet"&gt;CERN Communication Group (January 2008).

The LHC's main purpose is to explore the validity and limitations of the [[Standard Model]], the current theoretical picture for [[particle physics]]. The first particle collisions at the LHC took place shortly after startup in November 2009, at energies up to {{nowrap|1.2 [[TeV]]}} per beam.&lt;ref name="PR20.09E"&gt;CERN press release (2009) "[http://press.cern/press-releases/2009/12/lhc-ends-2009-run-high-note LHC ends 2009 run on a high note.]"&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 March 2010, the first planned collisions took place between two 3.5 TeV beams, which set another new world record for the highest energy man-made particle collisions.&lt;ref name=bbc20100330&gt;

Similar concerns had previously also been raised in the context of the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]], with [[Frank Close]], professor of physics at the [[University of Oxford]], to comment at the time that "the chance of &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[strangelet]] creation] is like you winning the major prize on the lottery 3 weeks in succession; the problem is that people believe it is possible to win the lottery 3 weeks in succession."&lt;ref name="EndDays"&gt;BBC ''End Days'' (Documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider started operation, critics postulated that the extremely high energy could produce catastrophic scenarios,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_3_24/ai_62102225 T. D. Gutierrez, "Doomsday Fears at RHIC," Skeptical Inquirer '''24''', 29 (May 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;
such as creating a [[black hole]], a transition into a different [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[vacuum state|vacuum]] (see [[false vacuum]]), or the creation of [[strange matter]] that is more stable than ordinary [[matter]]. These hypotheses are complex, but many predict that the [[Earth]] would be destroyed in a time frame from seconds to millennia, depending on the theory considered. However, the fact that objects of the Solar System (e.g., the [[Moon]]) have been bombarded with [[cosmic ray|cosmic particles]] of significantly higher energies than that of RHIC and other man made colliders for billions of years, without any harm to the Solar System, were among the most striking arguments that these hypotheses were unfounded.&lt;ref name="jaffe"/&gt;

{{Wikinews|Fireball generated in U.S. laboratory resembles black hole}}
The other main controversial issue was a demand by critics {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} for [[physicist]]s to reasonably exclude the [[probability]] for such a catastrophic scenario. Physicists are unable to demonstrate experimental and [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] constraints of zero probability of catastrophic events, nor that tomorrow Earth will be struck with a "[[Doomsday event|doomsday]]" [[cosmic ray]] (they can only calculate an upper limit for the likelihood). The result would be the same destructive scenarios described above, although obviously not caused by humans. According to this argument of upper limits, RHIC would still modify the chance for the Earth's survival by an infinitesimal amount.

Concerns were raised in connection with the RHIC particle accelerator, both in the media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[New Scientist]] |date=28 August 1999 |title=A Black Hole Ate My Planet |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16322014.700-a-black-hole-ate-my-planet.html |last=Matthews |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Matthews (scientist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Horizon: End Day |publisher=BBC |year=2005 |author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the popular science media.&lt;ref name="BlackHolesatBrookhaven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReplytoWagner"/&gt; The risk of a doomsday scenario was indicated by [[Martin Rees]], with respect to the RHIC, as being at least a 1 in 50 million chance.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

=== History of discussion ===
The debate started in 1999 with an exchange of letters in [[Scientific American]] between [[Walter L. Wagner]],&lt;ref name="BlackHolesatBrookhaven"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner is a lawyer and former physics lab technician. In 1975, he worked on a project that claimed to discover a [[magnetic monopole]] in cosmic ray data ("Evidence for the Detection of a Moving Magnetic Monopole", Physical Review Letters, Vol. 35, (1975)). That claim was later withdrawn in 1978 ("Further Measurements and Reassessment of the Magnetic Monopole Candidate", Physical Review D18: 1382–1421 (1978))&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frank Wilczek|F. Wilczek]],&lt;ref name="ReplytoWagner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilczek is noted for his work on quarks, for which he subsequently was awarded the Nobel Prize&lt;/ref&gt; [[Institute for Advanced Study]], in response to a previous article by M. Mukerjee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Mukerjee |first1=Madhusree |title=Brookhaven Brouhaha |magazine=Scientific American |date=February 1998 |volume=278 |issue=2 |pages=15–16 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0298-15 |jstor=26057648}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media attention unfolded with an article in [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] [[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]] of July 18, 1999 by J. Leake,&lt;ref name="JLeake18July1999"&gt;[http://www.wisdomofsolomon.com/bigbang.html Sunday Times, 18 July 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt; closely followed by articles in the U.S. media.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [https://web.archive.org/web/20031005104321/http://abcnews.go.com/sections/tech/FredMoody/moody990914.html ABCNEWS.com], from the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy mostly ended with the report of a [[committee]] convened by the [[Board of Directors|director]] of Brookhaven National Laboratory, [[John Marburger|J. H. Marburger]], ostensibly ruling out the catastrophic scenarios depicted.&lt;ref name="jaffe"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9910333 R. Jaffe ''et al.'', Rev. Mod. Phys. '''72''', 1125&amp;ndash;1140 (2000).]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the report left open the possibility that relativistic cosmic ray impact products might behave differently while transiting earth compared to "at rest" RHIC products; and the possibility that the qualitative difference between high-E proton collisions with earth or the moon might be different than gold on gold collisions at the RHIC. Wagner tried subsequently to stop full energy collision at RHIC by filing [[Federal government of the United States|Federal]] lawsuits in [[San Francisco]] and [[New York City]], but without success.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3077374/ MSNBC, June 14, 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt; The New York suit was dismissed on the technicality that the San Francisco suit was the preferred forum. The San Francisco suit was dismissed, but with leave to refile if additional information was developed and presented to the court.&lt;ref&gt;United States District Court, Eastern District of New York, Case No. 00CV1672, Walter L. Wagner vs. Brookhaven Science Associates, L.L.C. (2000); United States District Court, Northern District of California, Case No. C99-2226, Walter L. Wagner vs. U.S. Department of Energy, et al. (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 2005, the [[BBC]] published an article&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4357613.stm BBC, 17 March 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; implying that researcher [[Horaţiu Năstase]] believes black holes have been created at RHIC. However, the original papers of H. Năstase&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0501068 H. Nastase, hep-th/0501068 (2005).]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[New Scientist]] article&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/mg18524915.400 E. S. Reich, New Scientist '''185:2491''', 16 (2005).]&lt;/ref&gt; cited by the BBC state that the correspondence of the hot dense [[QCD matter]] created in RHIC to a black hole is only in the sense of a correspondence of [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] scattering in [[Minkowski space]] and scattering in the ''AdS''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; space in [[AdS/CFT]]; in other words, it is similar mathematically. Therefore, RHIC collisions might be described by mathematics relevant to theories of [[quantum gravity]]  within AdS/CFT, but the described physical phenomena are not the same.

In the run up to the commissioning of the LHC, Walter L. Wagner (an original opponent of the RHIC), Luis Sancho (a Spanish science writer) and [[Otto Rössler]] (a German biochemist) expressed concerns over the safety of the LHC, and attempted to halt the beginning of the experiments through petitions to the US and European Courts.&lt;ref name="CosmicLog-2September2008"&gt;Boyle, Alan (2 September 2008).

===Specific concerns===

====Micro black holes====
{{Main|Micro black hole}}

Although the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics predicts that LHC energies are far too low to create [[black hole]]s, some [[Beyond the standard model|extensions of the Standard Model]] posit the existence of extra spatial dimensions, in which it would be possible to create [[micro black hole]]s at the LHC at a rate of the order of one per second.&lt;ref&gt;Giddings, Steven B. and Thomas, Scott D. (19 June 2001), "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0106219 High-energy colliders as black hole factories: The End of short distance physics]" (PDF), [[arXiv:hep-ph/0106219]], "[[Physical Review]]" D65: 056010. {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevD.65.056010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Savas Dimopoulos|Dimopoulos, Savas]]; &amp; Landsberg, Greg (27 June 2001).

Because Hawking radiation allows black holes to lose mass, black holes that lose more matter than they gain through other means are expected to dissipate, shrink, and ultimately vanish. Smaller [[micro black hole]]s (MBHs), which could be produced at the LHC, are currently predicted by theory to be larger net emitters of radiation than larger black holes, and to shrink and dissipate instantly.&lt;ref&gt;Cavaglià, Marco (29 January 2007). "[http://www.einstein-online.info/en/spotlights/accelerators_bh/index.html Particle accelerators as black hole factories?]". ''Einstein-Online.'' [[Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics|Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The LHC Safety Assessment Group (LSAG) indicates that "there is broad consensus among physicists on the reality of Hawking radiation, but so far no experiment has had the sensitivity required to find direct evidence for it."&lt;ref name="LSAGreport"/&gt;

According to the LSAG, even if micro black holes were produced by the LHC and were stable, they would be unable to accrete matter in a manner dangerous for the Earth. They would also have been produced by [[cosmic rays]] and have stopped in [[neutron star]]s and [[white dwarf]]s, and the stability of these astronomical bodies means that they cannot be dangerous:&lt;ref name="LSAGreport"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schewe, Phil (9 September 2008). "[http://www.aip.org/pnu/2008/split/871-1.html Mini Black Holes No Danger] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013141529/http://www.aip.org/pnu/2008/split/871-1.html |date=2008-10-13 }}".

{{quote|Stable black holes could be either electrically charged or neutral. [...] If stable microscopic black holes had no electric charge, their interactions with the Earth would be very weak. Those produced by cosmic rays would pass harmlessly through the Earth into space, whereas those produced by the LHC could remain on Earth. However, there are much larger and denser astronomical bodies than the Earth in the Universe. Black holes produced in cosmic-ray collisions with bodies such as [[neutron star]]s and [[white dwarf]] stars would be brought to rest. The continued existence of such dense bodies, as well as the Earth, rules out the possibility of the LHC producing any dangerous black holes.&lt;ref name=SummarySafety/&gt;}}
&lt;!--[[Image:First Gold Beam-Beam Collision Events at RHIC at 100 100&amp;nbsp;GeV c per beam recorded by STAR.jpg|thumb|right|A particle collision at the RHIC. No strangelets have been detected in the RHIC or in any other lower-energy particle accelerators.]]--&gt;

====Strangelets====
{{Main|Strangelets}}

[[Strangelet]]s are small fragments of [[strange matter]]—a hypothetical form of [[quark matter]]—that contain roughly equal numbers of [[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], and [[strange quark|strange]] [[quark]]s and that are more stable than ordinary [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] (strangelets would range in size from a few [[Fermi (unit)|femtometers]] to a few meters across).&lt;ref name="LSAGreport"/&gt; If strangelets can actually exist, and if they were produced at the LHC, they could conceivably initiate a runaway fusion process in which all the nuclei in the planet would be converted to strange matter, similar to a [[Quark star#Strange star|strange star]].&lt;ref name="LSAGreport"/&gt;

The probability of the creation of strangelets decreases at higher energies.&lt;ref name="LSAGreport"/&gt; As the LHC operates at higher energies than the RHIC or the heavy ion programs of the 1980s and 1990s, the LHC is less likely to produce strangelets than its predecessors.&lt;ref name="LSAGreport"/&gt; Furthermore, models indicate that strangelets are only stable or long-lived at low temperatures. Strangelets are bound at low energies (in the range of 1–10&amp;nbsp;MeV), while the collisions in the LHC release energies in the range of 7–14&amp;nbsp;TeV. [[second law of thermodynamics|Thermodynamics]] very strongly disfavors the formation of a cold condensate that is an order of magnitude cooler than the surrounding medium. As an example, it is about as likely as producing an icecube in a furnace.&lt;ref name="LSAGreport"/&gt;

====Concerns not meeting peer review====
[[Otto Rössler]], a German chemistry professor at the [[University of Tübingen]], argues that micro black holes created in the LHC could grow exponentially.&lt;ref name="ORReview2008"&gt;[[Otto Rössler|Rössler, Otto]] (2008).

''[[die tageszeitung|Taz.de]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the meeting, Landua asked another expert, Hermann Nicolai, Director of the [[Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics|Albert Einstein Institute]], in Germany, to examine Rössler's arguments.&lt;ref name="Planetentods"/&gt; Nicolai reviewed Otto Rössler's research paper on the safety of the LHC&lt;ref name="ORTheory2008a"/&gt; and issued a statement highlighting logical inconsistencies and physical misunderstandings in Rössler's arguments.&lt;ref name="HermannNicolaiComments"&gt;"Comments from Prof. Dr. Hermann Nicolai, Director, Max Planck-Institut für Gravitationsphysik (Albert-Einstein-Institut) Potsdam, Germany on speculations raised by Professor Otto Rössler about the production of black holes at the LHC."

On {{nowrap|10 August 2008}}, Rainer Plaga, a German astrophysicist, posted a research paper on the [[arXiv]] Web archive concluding that LHC safety studies have not definitely ruled out the potential catastrophic threat from microscopic black holes, including the possible danger from [[Hawking radiation]] emitted by black holes.&lt;ref name="CosmicLog-August 19, 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2008_Plaga"&gt;Plaga, Rainer (10 August 2008).

=== Safety reviews ===

====CERN-commissioned reports====
Drawing from research performed to assess the safety of the RHIC collisions, the LHC Safety Study Group, a group of independent scientists, performed a safety analysis of the LHC, and released their findings in the 2003 report ''Study of Potentially Dangerous Events During Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC''. The report concluded that there is "no basis for any conceivable threat".&lt;ref name="2003SafetyReport"/&gt; Several of its arguments were based on the predicted evaporation of hypothetical micro black holes by [[Hawking radiation]] and on the theoretical predictions of the [[Standard Model]] with regard to the outcome of events to be studied in the LHC. One argument raised against doomsday fears was that collisions at energies equivalent to and higher than those of the LHC have been happening in nature for billions of years apparently without hazardous effects, as [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s impact Earth's atmosphere and other bodies in the universe.&lt;ref name="2003SafetyReport"/&gt;

In 2007, CERN mandated a group of five particle physicists not involved in the LHC experiments—the LHC Safety Assessment Group (LSAG), consisting of [[John Ellis (physicist)|John Ellis]], [[Gian Francesco Giudice|Gian Giudice]], Michelangelo Mangano and Urs Wiedemann, of CERN, and Igor Tkachev, of the [[Institute for Nuclear Research]] in Moscow—to monitor the latest concerns about the LHC collisions.&lt;ref name=SummarySafety/&gt; On {{nowrap|20 June 2008}}, in light of new experimental data and theoretical understanding, the LSAG issued a report updating the 2003 safety review, in which they reaffirmed and extended its conclusions that "LHC collisions present no danger and that there are no reasons for concern".&lt;ref name="LSAGreport"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SummarySafety/&gt; The LSAG report was then reviewed by [[CERN]]’s Scientific Policy Committee (SPC), a group of external scientists that advises CERN’s governing body, its Council.&lt;ref name="SPCreport2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_080621/&gt;&lt;ref name="PR05.08"&gt;"[http://press.cern/press-releases/2008/06/cern-council-looks-forward-lhc-start CERN Council looks forward to LHC start-up]". PR05.08 (20 June 2008). CERN 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The report was reviewed and endorsed by a panel of five independent scientists, Peter Braun-Munzinger, Matteo Cavalli-Sforza, [[Gerardus 't Hooft|Gerard 't Hooft]], [[Bryan Webber]] and Fabio Zwirner, and their conclusions were unanimously approved by the full 20 members of the SPC.&lt;ref name="PR05.08"/&gt; On {{nowrap|5 September 2008}}, the LSAG's "Review of the safety of LHC collisions" was published in the ''[[Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics]]'' by the UK [[Institute of Physics]], which endorsed its conclusions in a press release that announced the publication.&lt;ref name="LSAGreport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IOP-PR48(08)"/&gt;

Following the July 2008 release of the LSAG safety report,&lt;ref name="LSAGreport"/&gt; the Executive Committee of the Division of Particles and Fields (DPF) of the [[American Physical Society]], the world's second largest organization of physicists, issued a statement approving the LSAG's conclusions and noting that "this report explains why there is nothing to fear from particles created at the LHC".&lt;ref name="APS-Statement"/&gt; On {{nowrap|1 August 2008}}, a group of German quantum physicists, the Committee for Elementary Particle Physics (KET),&lt;ref name="ketweb"&gt;[http://www.ketweb.de/ Website of the Committee for Elementary Particle Physics (KET)] (in German).&lt;/ref&gt; published an open letter further dismissing concerns about the LHC experiments and carrying assurances that they are safe based on the LSAG safety review.&lt;ref name="Hawley-Spiegel"&gt;Hawley, Charles (6 August 2008).

The '''Scottish Agricultural Science Agency''' (SASA) was an [[Scottish Executive agencies|executive agency]] of the [[Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department]]. In 2008 – after a review of the public sector in Scotland – the agency was 'reabsorbed' into the Scottish Government becoming a division of the Rural Affairs Department. The new name of '''Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture''' was chosen so that the commonly used acronym 'SASA' could be maintained. The work conducted by the organisation and its facilities remain the same. The Agency has responsibility for providing scientific evidence for the implementation and enforcement of legislation and regulations in the areas of [[crop]]s and [[environmental protection]]. It provides scientific advice and support on a range of agricultural and environmental topics to the [[Scottish Government]].
The organisation is based at Roddinglaw on the Western edge of the City of [[Edinburgh]].

==History==
[[File:SASA - geograph.org.uk - 507684.jpg|thumbnail|The newly built SASA headquarters in 2007]]
From 1925 to 2006 the Agency and its precursors were based at East Craigs in Edinburgh. The Agency was first formed by the then [[Board of Agriculture for Scotland]]. The origins of SASA can be traced back to the opening of a full-time seed testing station in 1914 at 21 Duke Street, Edinburgh. Following the introduction of the Testing of Seeds Order 1917, the unit moved to larger premises at 7 Albany Street in 1918. In May 1925 the Seed Testing Station moved to new purpose built laborotaries at East Craigs along with the Plant registration Station. The Board of Agriculture changed its name to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (DAFS) in 1960, and in 1961 the operations at East Craigs were renamed Agricultural Scientific Services of DAFS. In 1992, the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency (SASA) was formed as an executive agency taking on the role of Agricultural Scientific Services for the then [[Scottish Office]]. Following [[devolution]] in [[Scotland]], the Agency became a part of the Environment and Rural Affairs Department. In 2000 SASA began developing plans to relocate from East Craigs due to the age of the facilities and the demands put upon them by new technologies, a suitable site was eventually identified on the Agency's own farm at Roddinglaw. SASA finally relocated to purpose built facilities at Roddinglaw in 2006. As of April 2008 SASA ceased to be an agency and became a division of the Rural affairs department, this forced a change of name, however to maintain the established acronym the name Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture was chosen.&lt;ref&gt;A guide to East Craigs. ''M.J. Richardson, S.R. Cooper, C.A. John and S.J. Clarke ''(1983) HMSO Dd. 880513&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years the Role of SASA has expanded greatly.

==Role==

The Role of SASA is as follows:
*Ensuring the quality of [[seed]]s and [[tuber]]s for planting, and new crop varieties;
*Keeping field and [[horticultural]] crops free of damaging diseases;
*Keeping serious pests of plants out of Scotland;
*Acting as the Scottish Executive's Inspectorate of [[genetically modified crops]];
*Developing new and more sensitive diagnostic tests for pests and diseases;
*Preserving and maintaining a wide range of historic, heritage and other varieties of [[potatoes]], [[cereals]], [[peas]] and [[brassica]]s;
*Monitoring the [[pesticide]] load in the [[Cuisine in Scotland|national diet]], and the pattern of use of pesticides in Scotland;
*Protecting [[Wildlife in Scotland|wildlife]] against deliberate or accidental poisoning
*Understanding the [[ecology]] of vertebrate species that conflict with agriculture (e.g. [[rabbit]]s, [[fox]]es, [[geese]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sasa.gov.uk/about_sasa/index.cfm Scottish Agricultural Science Agency- About SASA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107134851/http://www.sasa.gov.uk/about_sasa/index.cfm |date=7 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Einar Kjartansson began writing what is now called SU (the SY package) in the late 1970s while still a graduate student at [[Jon Claerbout]]'s [[Stanford Exploration Project]] (SEP). He continued to expand the package while he was a professor at the University of Utah in the early eighties.  In 1984, during an extended visit to SEP Einar introduced SY to Shuki Ronen, then a graduate student at Stanford. Ronen further developed SY from 1984 to 1986.   Other students at SEP started to use it and contributed code and ideas.  SY was inspired by much other software developed at SEP and benefited from the foundations laid by Claerbout and many of his students; Rob Clayton, Stew Levin, Dave Hale, Jeff
Thorson, Chuck Sword, and others who pioneered seismic processing on Unix in the seventies and early eighties.

In 1986, Shuki Ronen brought this work to the CWP at [[Colorado School of Mines]] during his one-year postdoctoral appointment there, Ronen aided Cohen in turning SU into a
supportable and exportable product.

Chris Liner ([http://sepwww.stanford.edu/oldsep/cliner/ChrisLiner.html homepage]), while a student at the Center, contributed to many of the graphics codes used in the pre-workstation (i.e., graphics terminal) age of  SU{{When|date=February 2011}}. Liner continues to promote the use of SU in his students' research at the [[University of Houston]].

Craig Artley, now with the Landmark division of Halliburton, made major contributions to the graphics codes while still a student at CWP and continues to make significant contributions to the general package{{When|date=February 2011}}.

Dave Hale wrote several of the heavy lifting processing codes as well as most of the core scientific and graphics libraries{{When|date=February 2011}}.

John Stockwell's involvement with SU began in 1989. He was largely responsible for the Makefile in the package.  He has been the main contact for the project since the first public release of SU in September 1992 (Release 17).  After Jack Cohen's death in 1996, Stockwell assumed the role of principal investigator of the SU project and has since remained in that role. The number of lines of code have more than tripled in the 11 years.

There have been many contributors to SU over the past two decades.

== Syntax ==

The Seismic Unix routines run under the Unix terminal, and can get maximum efficiency when using it with Bourne Shell (sh) or Bourne-again Shell (bash) scripting techniques.

=== Simple routines ===

Many of the programs run simply by a command on the terminal, for instance, to visualize a seismogram, as wiggle traces
&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;
$ suxwigb &lt; seismogram.su
&lt;/source&gt;
or as an image plot
&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;
$ suximage &lt; seismogram.su
&lt;/source&gt;

=== More elaborated routines ===

It is also possible, to use bash features to elaborate more complex processing structures:

&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;
$ for ((i=1;i&lt;=100;i++)); do
&gt; sufdmod2 &lt; model.bin &gt; output.mov nx=200 nz=300 tmax=5 xs=$i zs=0 hsfile=seismogram.$i.su
&gt; done
&lt;/source&gt;

In the example above Seismic Unix will create 100 seismograms in 100 different source positions

== SU Data ==

Here will have an explanation of how SU data is, it's headers and how they are organized in a big SU file with more than one gather:

--header—data—header—data--...

== SU Programs ==

Seismic Unix has many of the processes needed on the geophysical processing. It is possible to use it to manipulate and create your own seismograms, and also to convert them between the SU standard file and the industry standard, the [[SEG Y]].

Here you can find a list of the programs that the SU package has, with a brief description and a link to its help page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sepwww.stanford.edu/oldsep/cliner/files/suhelp/suhelp.html SU Help Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo vs LOK (RP1357, p176, 191-220).svg|right|thumb|Apollo CSM and LOK drawn to scale]]
The '''Soyuz 7K-LOK''', or simply '''LOK''' ({{lang-ru|Лунный Орбитальный Корабль|translit=Lunniy Orbitalny Korabl}} meaning "Lunar Orbital Craft") was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[manned spacecraft]] designed to launch men from Earth to orbit the Moon, developed in parallel to the [[Soyuz 7K-L1|7K-L1]]. The LOK would carry two cosmonauts, acting as a [[mother ship]] for the [[LK (spacecraft)|LK Lander]] which would land one crew member to the surface. It was part of the [[N1-L3]] programme which also included the LK lander and the [[N1 (rocket)|N1]] rocket.&lt;ref name=L3&gt;{{cite web|last=Wade|first=Mark|title=L3|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/l3.htm|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=5 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GnfVkCZc?url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/l3.htm|archivedate=22 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Like the 7K-OK model, the 7K-LOK was divided into three sections, an ellipsoid Orbital Module, the "headlight"-shaped Descent Module, and a cylindrical equipment module.  Like the 7K-OK, the 7K-LOK was capable of physically docking with another spacecraft, but lacked the transfer tunnel used on the [[Apollo (spacecraft)]], thus forcing the cosmonaut to make a [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalk]] from the 7K-LOK's orbital module to the LK Lander using the new [[Krechet]] space suit (the predecessor to the [[Orlan space suit]]s used today on the [[International Space Station]]).

Another change to the 7K-LOK was the elimination of the solar panels used on the 7K-OK, replacing them with [[fuel cells]] similar to those found on the Apollo CSM.  Another feature, a "cupola" located on the Orbital Module, allowed the cosmonaut in the 7K-LOK to perform the docking procedure with the LK Lander after lunar liftoff.  Only the Descent Module from the 7K-L1, with a thicker, reinforced heatshield, is used on the 7K-LOK and like the 7K-L1, is capable of doing a "[[skip reentry]]" so that the Soyuz could be recovered in the Soviet Union.

The [[information display systems]] (IDS) on the LOK were different from those of the Soyuz-7K. 
The Descent Module was equipped with the "Uran" control panel and the Orbital Module featured the "Orion" approach control panel.

==Flights==
Only three unmanned 7K-LOKs were flown in the short lifespan of the [[Soviet crewed lunar programs|failed Soviet lunar program]]. 

One of them was a dummy 7K-LOK as a [[Soyuz 7K-L1E]] modification of a [[Soyuz 7K-L1|Soyuz 7K-L1 "Zond"]] spacecraft and was successfully test launched into [[Low Earth orbit]] on a [[Proton (rocket family)|Proton rocket]] designated as [[Kosmos 382]] (Soyuz 7K-L1E No.2) on December 2, 1970.
Two other unsuccessful launches of dummy 7K-LOK ([[Soyuz 7K-L1E No.1]]) and operational ([[Soyuz 7K-LOK No.1]]) with dummy LKs were fulfilled atop the [[N1 rocket|N-1 rocket]] in its later flights on June 26, 1971 and November 23, 1972 intended for lunar flybys. Both spacecraft were pulled and saved by the [[launch escape system]] when those boosters failed. The two aborted flights later proved that the launch-escape system worked when a similar problem on a [[Soyuz-U]] forced the [[Soyuz T-10a]] to be jettisoned with its cosmonaut crew in 1983 before the booster exploded on the launchpad, destroying it. On two early flights of the N-1, both of them failures, another [[Soyuz 7K-L1S]] "Zond-M" modification of the 7K-L1 spacecraft instead of the 7K-LOK or 7K-L1E were used without the dummy LK, and they, along with the booster, were destroyed.

Subsequently, a complete L3 lunar expedition complex with an operational 7K-LOK and LK for an unmanned lunar flyby and landing mission (in preparation of a future manned scenario) was prepared for the fifth launch of a modified N1 rocket in August 1974. The [[N1-L3]] program was cancelled in May 1974 and the Soviets decided to concentrate on the development of [[space stations]], achieving several firsts in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Franchetti|title=Russia plans first men on Mars|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1678539,00.html|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|accessdate=2008-02-05 | location=London | date=July 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Although never flown, the planned — and discontinued — joint [[Russia]]n/[[European Space Agency|ESA]] [[CSTS|ACTS]] missions to the Moon, planned as a response to NASA's [[Project Constellation]], would have seen the resurrection, somewhat, of the 7K-LOK spacecraft, but with the current Soyuz TMA hardware (solar panels, docking &amp; transfer system, etc.) being used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21856">'''T-norm fuzzy logics''' are a family of [[non-classical logic]]s, informally delimited by having a [[semantics]] that takes the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] for the system of truth values and functions called [[t-norm]]s for permissible interpretations of [[logical conjunction|conjunction]]. They are mainly used in applied [[fuzzy logic]] and [[fuzzy set|fuzzy set theory]] as a theoretical basis for approximate reasoning.

T-norm fuzzy logics belong in broader classes of [[fuzzy logic]]s and [[many-valued logic]]s. In order to generate a well-behaved [[logical implication|implication]], the t-norms are usually required to be [[left-continuous]]; logics of left-continuous t-norms further belong in the class of [[substructural logic]]s, among which they are marked with the validity of the ''law of prelinearity'',  (''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''B'') &amp;or; (''B''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''A''). Both [[propositional logic|propositional]] and [[first-order logic|first-order]] (or [[higher-order logic|higher-order]]) t-norm fuzzy logics, as well as their expansions by [[Modal operator|modal]] and other operators, are studied. Logics that restrict the t-norm semantics to a subset of the real unit interval (for example, finitely valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]]s) are usually included in the class as well.

Important examples of t-norm fuzzy logics are [[monoidal t-norm logic|monoidal t-norm logic MTL]] of all left-continuous t-norms, [[BL (logic)|basic logic BL]] of all continuous t-norms, [[product fuzzy logic]] of the product t-norm, or the [[nilpotent minimum logic]] of the nilpotent minimum t-norm. Some independently motivated logics belong among t-norm fuzzy logics, too, for example Łukasiewicz logic (which is the logic of the Łukasiewicz t-norm) or [[intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett logic]] (which is the logic of the minimum t-norm).

As members of the family of [[fuzzy logic]]s, t-norm fuzzy logics primarily aim at generalizing classical two-valued logic by admitting intermediary [[truth value]]s between 1 (truth) and 0 (falsity) representing ''degrees'' of truth of propositions. The degrees are assumed to be real numbers from the unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. In propositional t-norm fuzzy logics, [[propositional formula|propositional connectives]] are stipulated to be [[truth-functional]], that is, the truth value of a complex proposition formed by a propositional connective from some constituent propositions is a function (called the ''truth function'' of the connective) of the truth values of the constituent propositions. The truth functions operate on the set of truth degrees (in the standard semantics, on the [0,&amp;nbsp;1] interval); thus the truth function of an ''n''-ary propositional connective ''c'' is a function ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;: [0,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Truth functions generalize [[truth table]]s of propositional connectives known from classical logic to operate on the larger system of truth values.

T-norm fuzzy logics impose certain natural constraints on the truth function of [[logical conjunction|conjunction]]. The truth function &lt;math&gt;*\colon[0,1]^2\to[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; of conjunction is assumed to satisfy the following conditions:
* ''Commutativity'', that is, &lt;math&gt;x*y=y*x&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' and ''y'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This expresses the assumption that the order of fuzzy propositions is immaterial in conjunction, even if intermediary truth degrees are admitted.
* ''Associativity'', that is, &lt;math&gt;(x*y)*z = x*(y*z)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This expresses the assumption that the order of performing conjunction is immaterial, even if intermediary truth degrees are admitted.
* ''Monotony'', that is, if &lt;math&gt;x \le y&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x*z \le y*z&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This expresses the assumption that increasing the truth degree of a conjunct should not decrease the truth degree of the conjunction.
* ''Neutrality of 1'', that is, &lt;math&gt;1*x = x&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This assumption corresponds to regarding the truth degree 1 as full truth, conjunction with which does not decrease the truth value of the other conjunct. Together with the previous conditions this condition ensures that also &lt;math&gt;0*x = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1], which corresponds to regarding the truth degree 0 as full falsity, conjunction with which is always fully false.
* ''Continuity'' of the function &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; (the previous conditions reduce this requirement to the continuity in either argument). Informally this expresses the assumption that microscopic changes of the truth degrees of conjuncts should not result in a macroscopic change of the truth degree of their conjunction. This condition, among other things, ensures a good behavior of (residual) implication derived from conjunction; to ensure the good behavior, however, ''left''-continuity (in either argument) of the function &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is sufficient.&lt;ref name="EG2001"&gt;Esteva &amp;amp; Godo (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In general t-norm fuzzy logics, therefore, only left-continuity of &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is required, which expresses the assumption that a microscopic ''decrease'' of the truth degree of a conjunct should not macroscopically decrease the truth degree of conjunction.

These assumptions make the truth function of conjunction a left-continuous [[t-norm]], which explains the name of the family of fuzzy logics (''t-norm based''). Particular logics of the family can make further assumptions about the behavior of conjunction (for example, [[Intermediate logic|Gödel logic]] requires its [[idempotence]]) or other connectives (for example, the logic IMTL requires the [[involution (mathematics)|involutiveness]] of negation).

All left-continuous t-norms &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; have a unique [[t-norm#Residuum|residuum]], that is, a binary function &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; such that for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1],
:&lt;math&gt;x*y\le z&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x\le y\Rightarrow z.&lt;/math&gt;
The residuum of a left-continuous t-norm can explicitly be defined as
:&lt;math&gt;(x\Rightarrow y)=\sup\{z\mid z*x\le y\}.&lt;/math&gt;
This ensures that the residuum is the pointwise largest function such that for all ''x'' and ''y'',
:&lt;math&gt;x*(x\Rightarrow y)\le y.&lt;/math&gt;
The latter can be interpreted as a fuzzy version of the [[modus ponens]] rule of inference. The residuum of a left-continuous t-norm thus can be characterized as the weakest function that makes the fuzzy modus ponens valid, which makes it a suitable truth function for implication in fuzzy logic. Left-continuity of the t-norm is the necessary and sufficient condition for this relationship between a t-norm conjunction and its residual implication to hold.

Truth functions of further propositional connectives can be defined by means of the t-norm and its residuum, for instance the residual negation &lt;math&gt;\neg x=(x\Rightarrow 0)&lt;/math&gt; or bi-residual equivalence &lt;math&gt;x\Leftrightarrow y = (x\Rightarrow y)*(y\Rightarrow x).&lt;/math&gt; Truth functions of propositional connectives may also be introduced by additional definitions: the most usual ones are the minimum (which plays a role of another conjunctive connective), the maximum (which plays a role of a disjunctive connective), or the Baaz Delta operator, defined in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = 0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise. In this way, a left-continuous t-norm, its residuum, and the truth functions of additional propositional connectives determine the truth values of complex propositional formulae in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

Formulae that always evaluate to 1 are called ''tautologies'' with respect to the given left-continuous t-norm &lt;math&gt;*,&lt;/math&gt; or ''&lt;math&gt;*\mbox{-}&lt;/math&gt;tautologies.'' The set of all &lt;math&gt;*\mbox{-}&lt;/math&gt;tautologies is called the ''logic'' of the t-norm &lt;math&gt;*,&lt;/math&gt; as these formulae represent the laws of fuzzy logic (determined by the t-norm) which hold (to degree 1) regardless of the truth degrees of [[atomic formula]]e. Some formulae are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] with respect to a larger class of left-continuous t-norms; the set of such formulae is called the logic of the class. Important t-norm logics are the logics of particular t-norms or classes of t-norms, for example:
* [[Łukasiewicz logic]] is the logic of the [[T-norm#Prominent examples|Łukasiewicz t-norm]] &lt;math&gt;x*y = \max(x+y-1,0)&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett logic]] is the logic of the [[T-norm#Prominent examples|minimum t-norm]] &lt;math&gt;x*y = \min(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Product fuzzy logic]] is the logic of the [[T-norm#Prominent examples|product t-norm]] &lt;math&gt;x*y = x\cdot y&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Monoidal t-norm logic]] MTL is the logic of (the class of) ''all'' left-continuous t-norms
* [[Basic fuzzy logic]] BL is the logic of (the class of) all ''continuous'' t-norms

It turns out that many logics of particular t-norms and classes of t-norms are axiomatizable. The completeness theorem of the axiomatic system with respect to the corresponding t-norm semantics on [0,&amp;nbsp;1] is then called the ''standard completeness'' of the logic. Besides the standard real-valued semantics on [0,&amp;nbsp;1], the logics are sound and complete with respect to general algebraic semantics, formed by suitable classes of prelinear commutative bounded integral [[residuated lattice]]s.

== History ==

Some particular t-norm fuzzy logics have been introduced and investigated long before the family was recognized (even before the notions of [[fuzzy logic]] or [[t-norm]] emerged):
* [[Łukasiewicz logic]] (the logic of the Łukasiewicz t-norm) was originally defined by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] (1920) as a [[three-valued logic]];&lt;ref name="Luk1920"&gt;Łukasiewicz J., 1920, O logice trojwartosciowej (Polish, On three-valued logic). Ruch filozoficzny '''5''':170–171.&lt;/ref&gt; it was later generalized to ''n''-valued (for all finite ''n'') as well as infinitely-many-valued variants, both propositional and first-order.&lt;ref name="Hay1963"&gt;Hay, L.S., 1963, Axiomatization of the infinite-valued predicate calculus. ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' '''28''':77–86.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett logic]] (the logic of the minimum t-norm) was implicit in [[Gödel]]'s 1932 proof of infinite-valuedness of [[intuitionistic logic]].&lt;ref name="Goe1932"&gt;Gödel K., 1932, Zum intuitionistischen Aussagenkalkül, ''Anzeiger Akademie der Wissenschaften Wien'' '''69''': 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Later (1959) it was explicitly studied by [[Michael Dummett|Dummett]] who proved a completeness theorem for the logic.&lt;ref name="Dum1959"&gt;Dummett M., 1959, Propositional calculus with denumerable matrix, ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' '''27''': 97–106&lt;/ref&gt;

A systematic study of particular t-norm fuzzy logics and their classes began with [[Petr Hájek|Hájek]]'s (1998) monograph ''Metamathematics of Fuzzy Logic'', which presented the notion of the logic of a continuous t-norm, the logics of the three basic continuous t-norms (Łukasiewicz, Gödel, and product), and the 'basic' fuzzy logic [[BL (logic)|BL]] of all continuous t-norms (all of them both propositional and first-order). The book also started the investigation of fuzzy logics as non-classical logics with Hilbert-style calculi, algebraic semantics, and metamathematical properties known from other logics (completeness theorems, deduction theorems, complexity, etc.).

Since then, a plethora of t-norm fuzzy logics have been introduced and their metamathematical properties have been investigated. Some of the most important t-norm fuzzy logics were introduced in 2001, by Esteva and Godo ([[monoidal t-norm logic|MTL]], IMTL, SMTL, NM, WNM),&lt;ref name="EG2001" /&gt; Esteva, Godo, and Montagna (propositional ŁΠ),&lt;ref name="EGM2001"&gt;Esteva F., Godo L., &amp; Montagna F., 2001, The ŁΠ and ŁΠ½ logics: Two complete fuzzy systems joining Łukasiewicz and product logics, ''Archive for Mathematical Logic'' '''40''': 39–67.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cintula (first-order ŁΠ).&lt;ref name="Cin2001"&gt;Cintula P., 2001, The ŁΠ and ŁΠ½ propositional and predicate logics, ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'' '''124''': 289–302.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical language ==

The logical vocabulary of [[propositional logic|propositional]] t-norm fuzzy logics standardly comprises the following connectives:
* '''Implication''' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ([[arity|binary]]). In the context of other than t-norm-based fuzzy logics, the t-norm-based implication is sometimes called '''residual implication''' or '''R-implication''', as its standard semantics is the [[t-norm#Residuum|residuum]] of the [[t-norm]] that realizes strong conjunction.
* '''Strong conjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\And&lt;/math&gt; (binary). In the context of substructural logics, the sign &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; and the names ''group'', ''intensional'', ''multiplicative'', or ''parallel conjunction'' are often used for strong conjunction.
* '''Weak conjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; (binary), also called '''lattice conjunction''' (as it is always realized by the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] operation of [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] in algebraic semantics). In the context of substructural logics, the names ''additive'', ''extensional'', or ''comparative conjunction'' are sometimes used for lattice conjunction. In the logic [[BL (logic)|BL]] and its extensions (though not in t-norm logics in general), weak conjunction is definable in terms of implication and strong conjunction, by
::&lt;math&gt;A\wedge B \equiv A \mathbin{\And} (A \rightarrow B).&lt;/math&gt;
:The presence of two conjunction connectives is a common feature of contraction-free [[substructural logic]]s.
* '''Bottom''' &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; ([[nullary]]); &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{0}&lt;/math&gt; are common alternative signs and '''zero''' a common alternative name for the propositional constant (as the constants bottom and zero of substructural logics coincide in t-norm fuzzy logics). The proposition &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; represents the ''falsity'' or ''absurdum'' and corresponds to the classical truth value ''false''.
* '''Negation''' &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt; ([[unary operation|unary]]), sometimes called '''residual negation''' if other negation connectives are considered, as it is defined from the residual implication by the reductio ad absurdum:
::&lt;math&gt;\neg A \equiv A \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Equivalence''' &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (binary), defined as
::&lt;math&gt;A \leftrightarrow B \equiv (A \rightarrow B) \wedge (B \rightarrow A)&lt;/math&gt;
: In t-norm logics, the definition is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(A \rightarrow B) \mathbin{\And} (B \rightarrow A).&lt;/math&gt;
* '''(Weak) disjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; (binary), also called '''lattice disjunction''' (as it is always realized by the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] operation of [[join (mathematics)|join]] in algebraic semantics). In t-norm logics it is definable in terms of other connectives as
::&lt;math&gt;A \vee B \equiv ((A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow B) \wedge ((B \rightarrow A) \rightarrow A)&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Top''' &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; (nullary), also called '''one''' and denoted by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{1}&lt;/math&gt; (as the constants top and zero of substructural logics coincide in t-norm fuzzy logics). The proposition &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the classical truth value ''true'' and can in t-norm logics be defined as
::&lt;math&gt;\top \equiv \bot \rightarrow \bot.&lt;/math&gt;

Some propositional t-norm logics add further propositional connectives to the above language, most often the following ones:
* The '''Delta''' connective &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; is a unary connective that asserts classical truth of a proposition, as the formulae of the form &lt;math&gt;\triangle A&lt;/math&gt; behave as in classical logic. Also called the '''Baaz Delta''', as it was first used by Matthias Baaz for [[Intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett logic]].&lt;ref name="Baa96"&gt;Baaz M., 1996, Infinite-valued Gödel logic with 0-1-projections and relativisations. In P. Hájek (ed.), ''Gödel'96: Logical Foundations of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics'', Springer, ''Lecture Notes in Logic'' '''6''': 23–33&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of a t-norm logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; by the Delta connective is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;L_{\triangle}.&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Truth constants''' are nullary connectives representing particular truth values between 0 and 1 in the standard real-valued semantics. For the real number &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding truth constant is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\overline{r}.&lt;/math&gt; Most often, the truth constants for all rational numbers are added. The system of all truth constants in the language is supposed to satisfy the ''bookkeeping axioms'':&lt;ref name="Haj98"&gt;Hájek (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\overline{r \mathbin{\And} s} \leftrightarrow (\overline{r} \mathbin{\And} \overline{s}),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\overline{r \rightarrow s} \leftrightarrow (\overline{r} \mathbin{\rightarrow} \overline{s}),&lt;/math&gt; etc. for all propositional connectives and all truth constants definable in the language.
* '''Involutive negation''' &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; (unary) can be added as an additional negation to t-norm logics whose residual negation is not itself [[involution (mathematics)|involutive]], that is, if it does not obey the law of double negation &lt;math&gt;\neg\neg A \leftrightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;. A t-norm logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; expanded with involutive negation is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;L_{\sim}&lt;/math&gt; and called ''&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with involution''.
* '''Strong disjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; (binary). In the context of substructural logics it is also called ''group'', ''intensional'', ''multiplicative'', or ''parallel disjunction''. Even though standard in contraction-free substructural logics, in t-norm fuzzy logics it is usually used only in the presence of involutive negation, which makes it definable (and so axiomatizable) by de Morgan's law from strong conjunction:
::&lt;math&gt;A \oplus B \equiv \mathrm{\sim}(\mathrm{\sim}A \mathbin{\And} \mathrm{\sim}B).&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Additional t-norm conjunctions and residual implications'''. Some expressively strong t-norm logics, for instance the logic [[ŁΠ]], have more than one strong conjunction or residual implication in their language. In the standard real-valued semantics, all such strong conjunctions are realized by different t-norms and the residual implications by their residua.

[[Well-formed formula]]e of propositional t-norm logics are defined from [[propositional variable]]s (usually [[countable|countably]] many) by the above logical connectives, as usual in [[propositional logic]]s. In order to save parentheses, it is common to use the following order of precedence:
* Unary connectives (bind most closely)
* Binary connectives other than implication and equivalence
* Implication and equivalence (bind most loosely)

First-order variants of t-norm logics employ the usual logical language of [[first-order logic]] with the above propositional connectives and the following [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s:
* '''General quantifier''' &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Existential quantifier''' &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;
The first-order variant of a propositional t-norm logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;L\forall.&lt;/math&gt;

== Semantics ==

[[Algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|Algebraic semantics]] is predominantly used for propositional t-norm fuzzy logics, with three main classes of [[algebraic structure|algebras]] with respect to which a t-norm fuzzy logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is [[completeness (logic)|complete]]:
* '''General semantics''', formed of all ''&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras'' — that is, all algebras for which the logic is [[Soundness theorem|sound]].
* '''Linear semantics''', formed of all ''linear'' &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras — that is, all &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras whose [[lattice (order)|lattice]] order is [[total order|linear]].
* '''Standard semantics''', formed of all ''standard'' &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras — that is, all &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras whose lattice reduct is the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] with the usual order. In standard &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras, the interpretation of strong conjunction is a left-continuous [[t-norm]] and the interpretation of most propositional connectives is determined by the t-norm (hence the names ''t-norm-based logics'' and ''t-norm &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras'', which is also used for &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras on the lattice [0,&amp;nbsp;1]). In t-norm logics with additional connectives, however, the real-valued interpretation of the additional connectives may be restricted by further conditions for the t-norm algebra to be called standard: for example, in standard &lt;math&gt;L_\sim&lt;/math&gt;-algebras of the logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with involution, the interpretation of the additional involutive negation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is required to be the ''standard involution'' &lt;math&gt;f_\sim(x)=1-x,&lt;/math&gt; rather than other involutions which can also interpret &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; over t-norm &lt;math&gt;L_\sim&lt;/math&gt;-algebras.&lt;ref name="FM2006"&gt;Flaminio &amp; Marchioni (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In general, therefore, the definition of standard t-norm algebras has to be explicitly given for t-norm logics with additional connectives.

The Theil index ''T''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is the same as [[Redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] in [[information theory]] which is the maximum possible [[entropy]] of the data minus the observed entropy. It is a special case of the [[generalized entropy index]]. It can be viewed as a measure of redundancy, lack of diversity, isolation, segregation, inequality, non-randomness, and compressibility. It was proposed by [[econometrics|econometrician]] [[Henri Theil]] at the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]].&lt;ref name="policymap" /&gt;

==Formula==
For a population of ''N'' "agents" each with characteristic ''x'', the situation may be represented by the list ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,...,''N'') where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the characteristic of agent ''i''. For example, if the characteristic is income, then ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the income of agent ''i''. 

The Theil ''T'' index is defined as&lt;ref name="Formulas" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
T_T=T_{\alpha=1} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N  \frac{x_i}{\mu} \ln\left(\frac{x_i}{\mu} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Theil ''L'' index is defined as&lt;ref name="Formulas" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
T_L = T_{\alpha=0}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \ln\left(\frac{\mu}{x_i}\right) 
&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the mean income:
: &lt;math&gt;
\mu=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i
&lt;/math&gt;
 
Equivalently, if the situation is characterized by a discrete distribution function ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; (''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,...,''W'') where  ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the fraction of the population with income ''k'' and ''W'' = ''N&amp;mu;'' is the total income, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^W f_k=1&lt;/math&gt;  and the Theil index is:

: &lt;math&gt;
T_T=\sum_{k=0}^W\, f_k\, \frac k \mu \ln\left(\frac k \mu \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is again the mean income:
: &lt;math&gt;
\mu=\sum_{k=0}^W k f_k
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in this case income ''k'' is an integer and ''k=1'' represents the smallest increment of income possible (e.g., cents).

if the situation is characterized by a continuous distribution function ''f''(''k'') (supported from 0 to infinity) where  ''f''(''k'')&amp;nbsp;''dk'' is the fraction of the population with income ''k'' to ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''dk'', then the Theil index is:

:&lt;math&gt;T_T=\int_0^\infty f(k) \frac k \mu \ln\left(\frac k \mu \right) dk&lt;/math&gt;

where the mean is:

: &lt;math&gt;
\mu=\int_0^\infty k f(k) \, dk
&lt;/math&gt;

Theil indices for some common continuous probability distributions are given in the table below:

If everyone has the same income, then ''T''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; equals&amp;nbsp;0.  If one person has all the income, then ''T''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; gives the result &lt;math&gt;\ln N&lt;/math&gt;, which is maximum inequality. Dividing ''T''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\ln N&lt;/math&gt; can normalize the equation to range from 0 to 1, but then the [[Economic inequality metrics|independence axiom]] is violated: &lt;math&gt;T[x\cup x]\ne T[x]&lt;/math&gt; and does not qualify as a measure of inequality.
 
The Theil index measures an entropic "distance" the population is away from the egalitarian state of everyone having the same income. The numerical result is in terms of negative entropy so that a higher number indicates more order that is further away from the complete equality. Formulating the index to represent negative entropy instead of entropy allows it to be a measure of inequality rather than equality.

==Derivation from entropy==
The Theil index is derived from [[Claude Shannon|Shannon]]'s measure of [[information entropy]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, where entropy is a measure of randomness in a given set of information. In information theory, physics, and the Theil index, the general form of entropy is

:&lt;math&gt;S = k \sum_{i=1}^N \left( p_i \log{\frac{1}{p_i}} \right) = - k \sum_{i=1}^N \left( p_i \log{p_i} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of finding member &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; from a random sample of the population.   In physics, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is Boltzmann's constant. In information theory, when information is given in binary digits, &lt;math&gt;k=1&lt;/math&gt; and the log base is 2.   In physics and also in computation of Theil index, the natural logarithm is chosen as the logarithmic base.  When &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be income per person &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, it needs to be normalized by dividing by the total population income, &lt;math&gt;N\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt;.  This gives the observed entropy &lt;math&gt;S_\text{Theil}&lt;/math&gt; of a population to be:

: &lt;math&gt;S_\text{Theil} =  \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \frac{x_i}{N \overline{x}} \ln{\frac{N \overline{x}}{x_i}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
 
The Theil index is &lt;math&gt;T_T = S_\text{max} - S_\text{Theil}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S_\text{max}&lt;/math&gt; is the theoretical maximum entropy that is reached when all incomes are equal, i.e. &lt;math&gt;x_i=\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. This is substituted into &lt;math&gt;S_\text{Theil}&lt;/math&gt; to give &lt;math&gt;S_\text{max} = \ln N&lt;/math&gt;, a constant determined solely by the population. So the Theil index gives a value in terms of an entropy that measures how far &lt;math&gt;S_\text{Theil}&lt;/math&gt; is away from the "ideal" &lt;math&gt;S_\text{max}&lt;/math&gt;. The index is a "negative entropy" in the sense that it gets smaller as the disorder gets larger, hence it is a measure of order rather than disorder.
 
When &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is in units of population/species, &lt;math&gt;S_\text{Theil}&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of biodiversity and is called the [[Shannon index]].  If the Theil index is used with x=population/species, it is a measure of inequality of population among a set of species, or "bio-isolation" as opposed to "wealth isolation".

The Theil index measures what is called [[Redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] in information theory.&lt;ref name="Formulas"&gt;http://www.poorcity.richcity.org (Redundancy, Entropy and Inequality Measures)&lt;/ref&gt; It is the left over "information space" that was not utilized to convey information, which reduces the effectiveness of the [[price signal]]. The Theil index is a measure of the redundancy of income (or other measure of wealth) in some individuals.  Redundancy in some individuals implies scarcity in others.  A high Theil index indicates the total income is not distributed evenly among individuals in the same way an uncompressed text file does not have a similar number of byte locations assigned to the available unique byte characters.

==Decomposability==
According to the [[World Bank]],&lt;blockquote&gt;"The best-known entropy measures are Theil’s T (&lt;math&gt;T_T&lt;/math&gt;) and Theil’s L (&lt;math&gt;T_L&lt;/math&gt;), both of which allow one to decompose inequality into the part that is due to inequality within areas (e.g. urban, rural) and the part that is due to differences between areas (e.g. the rural-urban income gap). Typically at least three-quarters of inequality in a country is due to within-group inequality, and the remaining quarter to between-group differences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Poverty Manual|date=8 August 2005|publisher=[[World Bank]]|page=95|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PGLP/Resources/PMch6.pdf|accessdate=4 February 2018|format=pdf|chapter=6. Inequality Measures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If the population is divided into &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; subgroups and 
* &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; is the income share of group &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, 
* &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the total population and &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; is the population of group &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; is the Theil index for that subgroup, 
* &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the average income in group &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and 
* &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the average income of the population, 

then Theil's T index is

: &lt;math&gt;
T_T = \sum_{i=1}^m s_i T_i + \sum_{i=1}^m s_i \ln{\frac{\overline{x}_i}{\mu}}
&lt;/math&gt; for  &lt;math&gt;
s_i = \frac{N_i}{N}\frac{\overline{x}_i}{\mu}
&lt;/math&gt;

For example, inequality within the United States is the average inequality within each state, weighted by state income, plus the inequality between states.

[[Image:Theil USCounties.png|center|500px|Map of economic inequality in the United States using the Theil Index. A high positive theil index indicates more income than population while a negative value shows more population than income. A value of zero shows equality between population and income.]]

:'''Note''': This image is not the Theil Index in each area of the United States, but of contributions to the Theil Index for the U.S. by each area. The Theil Index is always positive, although individual contributions to the Theil Index may be negative or positive.

The decomposition of the Theil index which identifies the share attributable to the between-region component becomes a helpful tool for the positive analysis of regional inequality as it suggests the relative importance of spatial dimension of inequality.&lt;ref name="Spatial decomposition"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Novotny |first=J. |year=2007 |title=On the measurement of regional inequality: Does spatial dimension of income inequality matter? |journal=Annals of Regional Science |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=563–580 |url=http://web.natur.cuni.cz/~pepino/NOVOTNY2007AnnalsofRegionalScience.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theil's ''T'' versus Theil's ''L'' ===
Both Theil's ''T'' and Theil's ''L'' are decomposable. The difference between them is based on the part of the outcomes distribution that each is used for. Indexes of inequality in the generalized entropy (GE) family are more sensitive to differences in income shares among the poor or among the rich depending on a parameter that defines the GE index. The smaller the parameter value for GE, the more sensitive it is to differences at the bottom of the distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inequality Measures|url=https://www.urban.org/research/data-methods/data-analysis/quantitative-data-analysis/inequality-measures|website=www.urban.org|publisher=Urban Institute|accessdate=5 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: GE(0) = Thiel's ''L'' and is more sensitive to differences at the lower end of the distribution. It is also referred to as the [[mean log deviation]] measure. 

: GE(1) = Theil's ''T'' and is more sensitive to differences at the top of the distribution.

The decomposability is a property of the Theil index which the more popular [[Gini coefficient]] does not offer.  The Gini coefficient is more intuitive to many people since it is based on the [[Lorenz curve]].  However, it is not easily decomposable like the Theil.

==Applications==
In addition to multitude of economic applications, the Theil index has been applied to assess performance of [[irrigation]] systems&lt;ref&gt;Rajan K. Sampath.

'''Transition state theory''' (TST) explains the [[reaction rate]]s of elementary [[chemical reaction]]s. The theory assumes a special type of [[chemical equilibrium]] (quasi-equilibrium) between [[reagent|reactant]]s and activated [[transition state]] complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | file = T06470 | title = transition state theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TST is used primarily to understand qualitatively how chemical reactions take place. TST has been less successful in its original goal of calculating absolute reaction rate constants because the calculation of absolute reaction rates requires precise knowledge of potential energy surfaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Truhlar, D. G. | author2 = Garrett, B. C. | author3 = Klippenstein, S. J. | title = Current Status of Transition-State Theory | journal = J. Phys. Chem. | year = 1996 | volume = 100 | issue = 31 | pages = 12771–12800 | doi = 10.1021/jp953748q}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has been successful in calculating the standard [[enthalpy]] of activation (Δ&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt;''H''&lt;sup&gt;ɵ&lt;/sup&gt;), the standard [[entropy of activation]] (Δ&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt;''S''&lt;sup&gt;ɵ&lt;/sup&gt;), and the standard [[Gibbs energy]] of activation (Δ&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt;''G''&lt;sup&gt;ɵ&lt;/sup&gt;) for a particular reaction if its rate constant has been experimentally determined.  (The &lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; notation refers to the value of interest ''at the transition state''.)

This theory was developed simultaneously in 1935 by [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Henry Eyring]], then at [[Princeton University]], and by [[Meredith Gwynne Evans]] and [[Michael Polanyi]] of the [[University of Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Laidler, K. | author2 = King, C. | title = Development of transition-state theory | journal = J. Phys. Chem. | year = 1983 | volume = 87 | issue = 15 | pages = 2657 | doi = 10.1021/j100238a002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Laidler, K. | author2 = King, C. | title = A lifetime of transition-state theory | journal = The Chemical Intelligencer | year = 1998 | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TST is also referred to as "activated-complex theory," "absolute-rate theory," and "theory of absolute reaction rates."&lt;ref name = laidler&gt;{{cite book | author = Laidler, K. J. | title = Theories of Chemical Reaction Rates | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the development of TST, the Arrhenius rate law was widely used to determine energies for the reaction barrier. The [[Arrhenius equation]] derives from empirical observations and ignores any mechanistic considerations, such as whether one or more reactive intermediates are involved in the conversion of a reactant to a product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1 = Anslyn, E. V. | author2 = Dougherty, D. A. | chapter = Transition State Theory and Related Topics | title = Modern Physical Organic Chemistry | publisher = University Science Books | year = 2006 | pages = 365–373 | isbn =  1891389319}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, further development was necessary to understand the two parameters associated with this law, the pre-exponential factor (''A'') and the activation energy (''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;). TST, which led to the [[Eyring equation]], successfully addresses these two issues; however, 46 years elapsed between the publication of the Arrhenius rate law, in 1889, and the Eyring equation derived from TST, in 1935. During that period, many scientists and researchers contributed significantly to the development of the theory.

[[Kramers theory of reaction kinetics]] improves the TST.

==Theory==
The basic ideas behind transition state theory are as follows:

#Rates of reaction can be studied by examining activated complexes near the [[saddle point]] of a [[potential energy surface]]. The details of how these complexes are formed are not important. The saddle point itself is called the transition state.
#The activated complexes are in a special equilibrium (quasi-equilibrium) with the reactant molecules.
#The activated complexes can convert into products, and kinetic theory can be used to calculate the rate of this conversion.

==Development==
In the development of TST, three approaches were taken as summarized below

===Thermodynamic treatment===

In 1884, [[Jacobus van't Hoff]] proposed the [[Van 't Hoff equation]] describing the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant for a reversible reaction:
:&lt;span style="font-size:140%;"&gt;A {{eqm}} B&lt;/span&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\ln K}{dT} = \frac{\Delta U}{RT^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where Δ''U'' is the change in internal energy, ''K'' is the [[equilibrium constant]] of the reaction, ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]], and ''T'' is [[thermodynamic temperature]]. Based on experimental work, in 1889, [[Svante Arrhenius]] proposed a similar expression for the rate constant of a reaction, given as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\ln k}{dT} = \frac{\Delta E}{RT^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Integration of this expression leads to the [[Arrhenius equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;k = Ae^{-E_a/RT}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is the rate constant. ''A'' was referred to as the frequency factor (now called the pre-exponential coefficient), and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is regarded as the activation energy. By the early 20th century many had accepted the Arrhenius equation, but the physical interpretation of ''A'' and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; remained vague. This led many researchers in chemical kinetics to offer different theories of how chemical reactions occurred in an attempt to relate ''A'' and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; to the molecular dynamics directly responsible for chemical reactions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In 1910, French chemist [[René Marcelin]] introduced the concept of standard Gibbs energy of activation. His relation can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;k\propto\exp\left(\frac{-\Delta^\ddagger G^\ominus}{RT}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

At about the same time as Marcelin was working on his formulation, Dutch chemists Philip Abraham Kohnstamm, Frans Eppo Cornelis Scheffer, and Wiedold Frans Brandsma introduced standard entropy of activation and the standard enthalpy of activation. They proposed the following rate constant equation

:&lt;math&gt;k\propto\exp\left(\frac{\Delta^\ddagger S^\ominus}{R}\right)\exp\left(\frac{-\Delta^\ddagger H^\ominus}{RT}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

However, the nature of the constant was still unclear.

===Kinetic-theory treatment===

In early 1900, [[Max Trautz]] and [[William Lewis (chemist)|William Lewis]] studied the rate of the reaction using [[collision theory]], based on the [[kinetic theory of gases]]. [[Collision theory]] treats reacting molecules as hard spheres colliding with one another; this theory neglects entropy changes, since it assumes that the collision between molecules are completely elastic.

Lewis applied his treatment to the following reaction and obtained good agreement with experimental result.

2HI → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

However, later when the same treatment was applied to other reactions, there were large discrepancies between theoretical and experimental results.

===Statistical-mechanical treatment===

[[Statistical mechanics]] played a significant role in the development of TST. However, the application of statistical mechanics to TST was developed very slowly given the fact that in mid-19th century, [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], and [[Leopold Pfaundler]] published several papers discussing reaction equilibrium and rates in terms of molecular motions and the statistical distribution of molecular speeds.

It was not until 1912 when the French chemist A. Berthoud used the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] law to obtain an expression for the rate constant.

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d\ln k}{dT} = \frac{a-bT}{RT^2} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are constants related to energy terms.

Two years later, [[René Marcelin]] made an essential contribution by treating the progress of a chemical reaction as a motion of a point in [[phase space]]. He then applied Gibbs' statistical-mechanical procedures and obtained an expression similar to the one he had obtained earlier from thermodynamic consideration.

In 1915, another important contribution came from British physicist James Rice. Based on his statistical analysis, he concluded that the rate constant is proportional to the "critical increment". His ideas were further developed by [[Richard Chace Tolman]].  In 1919, Austrian physicist [[Karl Ferdinand Herzfeld]] applied [[statistical mechanics]] to the [[equilibrium constant]] and kinetic theory to the rate constant of the reverse reaction, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;, for the reversible dissociation of a diatomic molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Herzfeld, K. E.| journal = Annalen der Physik | year = 1919 | volume = 364 | pages = 635–667 | doi = 10.1002/andp.19193641504 | title = Zur Theorie der Reaktionsgeschwindigkeiten in Gasen | issue = 15| bibcode = 1919AnP...364..635H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;AB &lt;=&gt;[k_1][k_{-1}] {A} + {B}&lt;/chem&gt;

He obtained the following equation for the rate constant of the forward reaction&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith J. Laidler]], ''Chemical Kinetics'' (3rd ed., Harper &amp; Row 1987), p.277 {{ISBN|0-06-043862-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; k_1 = \frac{k_\mathrm{B}T}{h}\left(1-e^{-\frac{h\nu}{k_BT}}\right)\exp\left(\frac{-E^\ominus}{RT}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle E^\ominus&lt;/math&gt; is the dissociation energy at absolute zero, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]], ''T'' is thermodynamic temperature, ''υ'' is [[vibrational frequency]] of the bond.
This expression is very important since it is the first time that the factor ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''/''h'', which is a critical component of TST, has appeared in a rate equation.

In 1920, the American chemist [[Richard Chace Tolman]] further developed Rice's idea of the critical increment. He concluded that critical increment (now referred to as activation energy) of a reaction is equal to the average energy of all molecules undergoing reaction minus the average energy of all reactant molecules.

===Potential energy surfaces===

The concept of potential energy surface was very important in the development of TST. The foundation of this concept was laid by [[René Marcelin]] in 1913. He theorized that the progress of a chemical reaction could be described as a point in a potential energy surface with coordinates in atomic momenta and distances.

In 1931, [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Henry Eyring]] and [[Michael Polanyi]] constructed a potential energy surface for the reaction below. This surface is a three-dimensional diagram based on quantum-mechanical principles as well as experimental data on vibrational frequencies and energies of dissociation.

H + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H

A year after the Eyring and Polanyi construction, Hans Pelzer and [[Eugene Wigner]] made an important contribution by following the progress of a reaction on a potential energy surface. The importance of this work was that it was the first time that the concept of col or saddle point in the potential energy surface was discussed. They concluded that the rate of a reaction is determined by the motion of the system through that col.

It has been typically assumed that the rate-limiting or lowest saddle point is located on the same energy surface as the initial ground state. However, it was recently found that this could be incorrect for processes occurring in semiconductors and insulators, where an initial excited state could go through a saddle point lower than the one on the surface of the initial ground state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Luo, G. | author2 = Kuech, T.

==Derivation of the Eyring equation==
One of the most important features introduced by [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Eyring]], [[Michael Polanyi|Polanyi]] and [[Meredith Gwynne Evans|Evans]] was the notion that activated complexes are in quasi-equilibrium with the reactants. The rate is then directly proportional to the concentration of these complexes multiplied by the frequency (''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''/''h'') with which they are converted into products.

===Quasi-equilibrium assumption===

It should be noted that quasi-equilibrium is different from classical chemical equilibrium, but can be described using the same thermodynamic treatment.&lt;ref name = laidler/&gt; Consider the reaction below

:&lt;chem&gt; {A} + {B} &lt;=&gt; {[AB]^\ddagger} -&gt; {P} &lt;/chem&gt;

[[Image:quasi-equilibrium1.jpg|thumb|Figure 2: Potential energy diagram|300px]]

where complete equilibrium is achieved between all the species in the system including activated complexes, [AB]&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; .  Using statistical mechanics, concentration of [AB]&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; can be calculated in terms of the concentration of A and B.

TST assumes that even when the reactants and products are not in equilibrium with each other, the activated complexes are in quasi-equilibrium with the reactants. As illustrated in Figure 2, at any instant of time, there are a few activated complexes, and some were reactant molecules in the immediate past, which are designated [AB&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; (since they are moving from left to right). The remainder of them were product molecules in the immediate past ([AB&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt;).  Since the system is in complete equilibrium, the concentrations of [AB&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;] &lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; and [AB&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; are equal, so that each concentration is equal to one-half of the total concentration of activated complexes:

:&lt;math chem&gt; [\ce{AB}_{r}]^{\ddagger} = [\ce{AB}_{l}]^{\ddagger} = \frac{1}{2}[\ce{AB}]^{\ddagger}&lt;/math&gt;

In TST, it is assumed that the flux of activated complexes in the two directions are independent of each other. That is, if all the product molecules were suddenly removed from the reaction system, the flow of [AB&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; stops, but there is still a flow from left to right. Hence, to be technically correct, the reactants are in equilibrium only with [AB&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt;, the activated complexes that were reactants in the immediate past.

The activated complexes do not follow a Boltzmann distribution of energies, but an "equilibrium constant" can still be derived from the distribution they do follow. The [[equilibrium constant]] K&lt;sup&gt;‡ɵ&lt;/sup&gt; for the quasi-equilibrium can be written as
:&lt;math chem&gt;K^{\ddagger\ominus} = \frac\ce{[AB]^\ddagger}\ce{[A][B]}&lt;/math&gt;

So, the concentration of the transition state AB&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; is

:&lt;math chem&gt;[\ce{AB}]^{\ddagger} = K^{\ddagger\ominus}[\ce{A}][\ce{B}] &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the rate equation for the production of product is

:&lt;math chem&gt;\frac{d[\ce P]}{dt} = k^{\ddagger\ominus}[\ce{AB}]^{\Dagger} = k^{\ddagger}K^{\Dagger }[\ce A][\ce B] = k[\ce A][\ce B]&lt;/math&gt;

Where the rate constant k is given by

:&lt;math&gt; k = k^{\Dagger}K^{\Dagger}&lt;/math&gt;

''k''&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; is directly proportional to the frequency of the vibrational mode responsible for converting the activated complex to the product; the frequency of this vibrational mode is &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;. Every vibration does not necessarily lead to the formation of product, so a proportionality constant &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, referred to as the transmission coefficient, is introduced to account for this effect. So ''k''&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;k^{\Dagger } = \kappa\nu &lt;/math&gt;

For the equilibrium constant K&lt;sup&gt;‡ &lt;/sup&gt;, statistical mechanics leads to a temperature dependent expression given as

:&lt;math&gt;K^{\Dagger } = \frac{k_BT}{h\nu} K^{\Dagger '} &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;K^{\Dagger '} = e^{\frac{- \Delta G^{\Dagger }}{RT}}&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the new expressions for k&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt;, a new rate constant expression can be written, which is given as

:&lt;math&gt;k = k^{\Dagger }K^{\Dagger } =\kappa\frac{k_BT}{h}e^{\frac{- \Delta G^{\Dagger }}{RT}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since, by definition, Δ''G''&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; = Δ''H''&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; –TΔ''S''&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt;, the rate constant expression can be expanded, to give an alternative form of the Eyring equation

:&lt;math&gt;k = \kappa\frac{k_BT}{h}e^{\frac{\Delta S^{\Dagger }}{R}}e^{\frac{- \Delta H^{\Dagger }}{RT}}&lt;/math&gt;

TST's rate constant expression can be used to calculate the Δ&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt;''G''&lt;sup&gt;ɵ&lt;/sup&gt;, Δ&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt;''H''&lt;sup&gt;ɵ&lt;/sup&gt;, Δ&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt;''S''&lt;sup&gt;ɵ&lt;/sup&gt;, and even Δ&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' (the volume of activation) using experimental rate data.

Given the relationship between equilibrium constant and the forward and reverse rate constants, &lt;math&gt;K=k_1/k_{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, the Eyring equation implies that 

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta G^\circ =\Delta G^\ddagger_{1}-\Delta G^\ddagger_{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

==Limitations of transition state theory==
In general, TST has provided researchers with a conceptual foundation for understanding how chemical reactions take place. Even though the theory is widely applicable, it does have limitations. For example, when applied to each elementary step of a multi-step reaction, the theory assumes that each intermediate is long-lived enough to reach a Boltzmann distribution of energies before continuing to the next step. When the intermediates are very short-lived, TST fails. In such cases, the momentum of the reaction trajectory from the reactants to the intermediate can carry forward to affect product selectivity (an example of such a reaction is the thermal decomposition of diazaobicyclopentanes, presented by Anslyn and [[Dennis A. Dougherty|Dougherty]]).

Transition state theory is also based on the assumption that atomic nuclei behave according to classic mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eyring, H. | journal = J. Chem. Phys. | year = 1935 | volume = 3 | pages = 107–115 | doi = 10.1063/1.1749604 | title = The Activated Complex in Chemical Reactions | issue = 2| bibcode = 1935JChPh...3..107E }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed that unless atoms or molecules collide with enough energy to form the transition structure, then the reaction does not occur. However, according to quantum mechanics, for any barrier with a finite amount of energy, there is a possibility that particles can still tunnel across the barrier. With respect to chemical reactions this means that there is a chance that molecules will react, even if they do not collide with enough energy to traverse the energy barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Masel, R. | title = Principles of Adsorption and Reactions on Solid Surfaces | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this effect is negligible for reactions with large activation energies, it becomes an important phenomenon for reactions with relatively low energy barriers, since the tunneling probability increases with decreasing barrier height.

Transition state theory fails for some reactions at high temperature. The theory assumes the reaction system will pass over the lowest energy saddle point on the potential energy surface. While this description is consistent for reactions occurring at relatively low temperatures, at high temperatures, molecules populate higher energy vibrational modes; their motion becomes more complex and collisions may lead to transition states far away from the lowest energy saddle point. This deviation from transition state theory is observed even in the simple exchange reaction between diatomic hydrogen and a hydrogen radical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Pineda, J. R. | author2 = Schwartz, S. D. | journal = Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B | year = 2006 | volume = 361 | pages = 1433–1438 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2006.1877 | pmid = 16873129 | title = Protein dynamics and catalysis: The problems of transition state theory and the subtlety of dynamic control | issue = 1472 | pmc = 1647311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given these limitations, several alternatives to transition state theory have been proposed. A brief discussion of these theories follows.

==Generalized transition state theory==
Any form of TST, such as microcanonical variational TST, [[Variational transition-state theory|canonical variational TST]], and improved canonical variational TST, in which the transition state is not necessarily located at the saddle point, is referred to as generalized transition state theory.

===Microcanonical variational TST===

A fundamental flaw of transition state theory is that it counts any crossing of the transition state as a reaction from reactants to products or vice versa. In reality, a molecule may cross this "dividing surface" and turn around, or cross multiple times and only truly react once. As such, unadjusted TST is said to provide an upper bound for the rate coefficients. To correct for this, variational transition state theory varies the location of the dividing surface that defines a successful reaction in order to minimize the rate for each fixed energy. &lt;ref name="Truhlar1984"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Variational Transition State Theory | journal=Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem.| year=1984 | first=D. | last=Truhlar |author2=Garrett, B.  | volume=35 | issue= | pages=159–189| doi=10.1146/annurev.pc.35.100184.001111|bibcode = 1984ARPC...35..159T }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate expressions obtained in this microcanonical treatment can be integrated over the energy, taking into account the statistical distribution over energy states, so as to give the canonical, or thermal rates.

===Canonical variational TST===

A development of transition state theory in which the position of the dividing surface is varied so as to minimize the rate constant at a given temperature.

===Improved canonical variational TST===

A modification of canonical variational transition state theory in which, for energies below the threshold energy, the position of the dividing surface is taken to be that of the microcanonical threshold energy. This forces the contributions to rate constants to be zero if they are below the threshold energy. A compromise dividing surface is then chosen so as to minimize the contributions to the rate constant made by reactants having higher energies.

=== [[Nonadiabatic transition state theory|Nonadiabatic TST]] ===
An expansion of TST to the reactions when two spin-states are involved simultaneously is called [[Nonadiabatic transition state theory|nonadiabatic transition state theory (NA-TST)]].

==Applications of TST: enzymatic reactions==
[[Enzyme catalysis|Enzymes catalyze]] chemical reactions at rates that are astounding relative to uncatalyzed chemistry at the same reaction conditions.  Each catalytic event requires a minimum of three or often more steps, all of which occur within the few milliseconds that characterize typical enzymatic reactions.  According to transition state theory, the smallest fraction of the catalytic cycle is spent in the most important step, that of the transition state.  The original proposals of absolute reaction rate theory for chemical reactions defined the transition state as a distinct species in the reaction coordinate that determined the absolute reaction rate.  Soon thereafter, [[Linus Pauling]] proposed that the powerful catalytic action of enzymes could be explained by specific tight binding to the transition state species &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pauling, L. | journal = American Scientist | year = 1948 | volume = 36 | pages = 50–58 | title = Chemical Achievement and Hope for the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because reaction rate is proportional to the fraction of the reactant in the transition state complex, the enzyme was proposed to increase the concentration of the reactive species.

This proposal was formalized by Wolfenden and coworkers at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], who hypothesized that the rate increase imposed by enzymes is proportional to the affinity of the enzyme for the transition state structure relative to the Michaelis complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Radzicka, A. | author2 = Wolfenden, R. | journal = Science | year = 1995 | volume = 267 | pages = 90–93 | doi = 10.1126/science.7809611 | pmid = 7809611 | title = A proficient enzyme | issue = 5194| bibcode = 1995Sci...267...90R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because enzymes typically increase the non-catalyzed reaction rate by factors of 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;, and Michaelis complexes{{clarify|reason=This was not defined above|date=April 2015}} often have dissociation constants in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; M, it is proposed that transition state complexes are bound with dissociation constants in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;−14 &lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; M.  As substrate progresses from the Michaelis complex to product, chemistry occurs by enzyme-induced changes in electron distribution in the substrate.

Enzymes alter the electronic structure by protonation, proton abstraction, electron transfer, geometric distortion, hydrophobic partitioning, and interaction with Lewis acids and bases.  These are accomplished by sequential protein and substrate conformational changes.  When a combination of individually weak forces are brought to bear on the substrate, the summation of the individual energies results in large forces capable of relocating bonding electrons to cause bond-breaking and bond-making.  Analogs that resemble the transition state structures should therefore provide the most powerful noncovalent inhibitors known, even if only a small fraction of the transition state energy is captured.

All chemical transformations pass through an unstable structure called the transition state, which is poised between the chemical structures of the substrates and products.  The transition states for chemical reactions are proposed to have lifetimes near 10&lt;sup&gt;−13 &lt;/sup&gt; seconds, on the order of the time of a single bond vibration.  No physical or spectroscopic method is available to directly observe the structure of the transition state for enzymatic reactions, yet transition state structure is central to understanding enzyme catalysis since enzymes work by lowering the activation energy of a chemical transformation.

It is now accepted that enzymes function to stabilize transition states lying between reactants and products, and that they would therefore be expected to bind strongly any inhibitor that closely resembles such a transition state.  Substrates and products often participate in several enzyme reactions, whereas the transition state tends to be characteristic of one particular enzyme, so that such an inhibitor tends to be specific for that particular enzyme.  The identification of numerous transition state inhibitors supports the transition state stabilization hypothesis for enzymatic catalysis.

Currently there is a large number of enzymes known to interact with transition state analogs, most of which have been designed with the intention of inhibiting the target enzyme.  Examples include HIV-1 protease, racemases, β-lactamases, metalloproteinases, cyclooxygenases and many others.

It provides guidance information that can be used to guide an unmanned vehicle during rendezvous and docking operations in space.  TriDAR does not rely on any reference markers positioned on the target spacecraft.  Instead, TriDAR relies on a [[laser]] based [[3D scanner|3D sensor]] and a [[Thermographic camera|thermal imager]].  TriDAR's proprietary software uses the geometric information contained in successive 3D images to match against the known shape of the target object and calculate its position and orientation.

TriDAR made its inaugural demonstration space flight onboard [[Space Shuttle Discovery]] on the [[STS-128]] mission, launched on 28 August 2009. On STS-128, TriDAR provided astronauts with real-time guidance information during rendezvous and docking with the International Space Station (ISS). It automatically acquired and tracked the ISS using only knowledge about its shape. This marked the first time a 3D sensor based "targetless" tracking vision system was used in space.

==Background==
To date, most operational tracking solutions for pose estimation and tracking on-orbit have relied on cooperative markers placed on the target object(s).  The [[Advanced Space Vision System|Space Vision System]] (SVS) used black on white or white on black dot targets.  These targets were imaged with [[Space Shuttle]] or [[International Space Station]] (ISS) video cameras to compute the relative pose of ISS modules to be assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Machine Vision in Space |journal=[[Canadian Aeronautics and Space Journal]] |first1=S. G. |last1=MacLean |first2=H. F. L. |last2=Pinkney |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=63–77 |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trajectory Control System (TCS) is currently used on board the space shuttle to provide guidance information during rendezvous and docking with the International Space Station (ISS).  This laser-based system tracks retro reflectors located on the ISS to provide bearing, range and closing rate information.  While reliable, target based systems have operational limitations as targets must be installed on target payloads.  This is not always practical or even possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=SUMO/FREND: vision system for autonomous satellite grapple |journal=Proc.

==STS-128==
[[File:TriDAR on STS-128 (iss020e035665).jpg|thumb|TriDAR during STS-128]]
TriDAR was tested for the first time in Space on board [[Space Shuttle Discovery]] during the [[STS-128]] mission to the [[ISS]].  The objective of the test was to demonstrate the capability of the TriDAR system to track an object in space without using targets markers such as retro-reflectors.  For this mission, TriDAR was located in the payload bay on the Orbiter Docking System (ODS) next to the Shuttle's Trajectory Control System (TCS).

The system was activated during rendezvous when the Shuttle was approximately {{convert|75|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the ISS.  Once in range of the 3D sensor, TriDAR automatically determined bearing and range to the ISS.  During rendezvous, TriDAR entered shape based tracking which provided full 6 degree of freedom guidance and closing rate.  Key system information was provided in real-time to the crew via enhanced docking displays on a laptop computer located on the shuttle's crew compartment.

The system was designed to perform the entire mission autonomously.  It self-monitored its tracking solution and automatically re-acquired the ISS if tracking had been lost.  TriDAR was also tested during undocking and fly-around operations.

==STS-131==
[[File:TriDAR on STS-131 (iss023e020008).jpg|thumb|TriDAR during STS-131]]
TriDAR was again carried onboard [[Space Shuttle Discovery]] during the [[STS-131]] mission to the [[International Space Station]].  The TriDAR operated during shuttle rendezvous with the ISS, and acquired useful data up till the shuttle R-bar Pitch Maneuver.  At that point, a cabling issue resulted in a loss of communications.&lt;ref name="obss"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/04/sts-131-discovery-undocking-storrm-tridar-highlighted/ |title=STS-131 Discovery Undocking STORRM TriDAR Highlighted |work=NASA Spaceflight |first=Chris |last=Gebhardt |year=2010 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a backup cable for undock and flyaround, the TriDAR operated "flawlessly", according to flight director Richard Jones.&lt;ref name="obss2"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=STS-131 Flight Day 13: Status briefing |series=Status Briefings |credits=Presenters: Brandi Dean |network=[[NASA TV]] |station=NASA TV Media Channel |location=Houston, Texas |airdate=17 April 2010 |minutes=7:45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system includes a 3D active sensor, a thermal imager and Neptec's model based tracking software.  Using only knowledge about the target spacecraft's geometry and 3D data acquired from the sensor, the system computes the 6 Degree Of Freedom (6DOF) relative pose directly.  The computer vision algorithms developed by Neptec allow this process to happen in real-time on a flight computer while achieving the necessary robustness and reliability expected for mission critical operations.  Fast data acquisition has been achieved by implementing a smart scanning strategy referred to as More Information Less Data (MILD) where only the necessary data to perform the pose estimation is acquired by the sensor.  This strategy minimizes the requirements on acquisition time, data bandwidth, memory and processing power.

==Hardware==
The TriDAR sensor is a hybrid 3D camera that combines auto-synchronous laser triangulation technology with laser radar (LIDAR) in a single optical package.  This configuration takes advantage of the complementary nature of these two imaging technologies to provide 3D data at both short and long range without compromising on performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://robotics.estec.esa.int/i-SAIRAS/isairas2005/session_09a/4_english_9a.pdf |title=TriDAR: A hybrid sensor for exploiting the complementary nature of triangulation and LIDAR technologies |conference=8th International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Automation in Space (i-SAIRAS 2005). 5–8 September 2005.

The subsystems also share the same control and processing electronics thus providing further savings compared to using two separate 3D sensors.  A thermal imager is also included to extend the range of the system beyond the LIDAR operating range.

Because of its wide operating range, the TriDAR sensor can be used for several applications within the same mission.  TriDAR can be used for rendezvous and docking, planetary landing, rover navigation, site and vehicle inspection.  TriDAR's capabilities for planetary exploration have been demonstrated recently during field trials in Hawaii held by NASA and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). For these tests, TriDAR was mounted on Carnegie Mellon University's [[Scarab (lunar rover)|Scarab lunar rover]] and enabled it to automatically navigate to its destination. Once the rover arrived at its destination, TriDAR was used to acquire high resolution 3D images of the surrounding area, searching for ideal drill sites to obtain lunar samples.

TriDAR applications are not limited to space. TriDAR technology is the basis of Neptec's OPAL product. OPAL provides vision to helicopter crews when their vision has been obscured by brownouts or whiteouts. TriDAR technology can also be applied to numerous terrestrial applications such as automated vehicles, hazard detection, radiotherapy patient positioning, assembly of large structure as well as human body tracking for motion capture or video game controls.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4402">In [[computer science]], '''uncertain data''' is data that contains [[measurement error|noise]] that makes it deviate from the correct, intended or original values. In the age of [[big data]], uncertainty or data veracity is one of the defining characteristics of data. Data is constantly growing in volume, variety, velocity and uncertainty (1/veracity). Uncertain data is found in abundance today on the web, in sensor networks, within enterprises both in their structured and unstructured sources. For example, there may be uncertainty regarding the address of a customer in an enterprise dataset, or the temperature readings captured by a sensor due to aging of the sensor. In 2012 IBM called out '''managing uncertain data at scale''' in its '''global technology outlook''' report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.zurich.ibm.com/pdf/isl/infoportal/GTO_2012_Booklet.pdf|title=Global Technology Outlook|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that presents a comprehensive analysis looking three to ten years into the future seeking to identify significant, disruptive technologies that will change the world. In order to make confident business decisions based on real-world data, analyses must necessarily account for many different kinds of uncertainty present in very large amounts of data. Analyses based on uncertain data will have an effect on the quality of subsequent decisions, so the degree and types of inaccuracies in this uncertain data cannot be ignored.

Uncertain data is found in the area of [[sensor networks]]; text where [[noisy text]] is found in abundance on social media, web and within enterprises where the structured and unstructured data may be old, outdated, or plain incorrect; in modeling where the [[mathematical model]] may only be an approximation of the actual process. When representing such data in a [[database]], some indication of the [[probability]] of the correctness of the various values also needs to be estimated.

There are three main models of uncertain data in databases. In '''attribute uncertainty''', each uncertain attribute in a tuple is subject to its own independent [[probability distribution]].&lt;ref name="orion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prabhakar|first=Sunil |title=ORION: Managing Uncertain (Sensor) Data|url=http://mobisensors.cs.pitt.edu/files/papers/prabhakar.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if readings are taken of temperature and wind speed, each would be described by its own probability distribution, as knowing the reading for one measurement would not provide any information about the other.

In '''correlated uncertainty''', multiple attributes may be described by a [[joint probability distribution]].&lt;ref name="orion"/&gt; For example, if readings are taken of the position of an object, and the ''x''- and ''y''-coordinates stored, the probability of different values may depend on the distance from the recorded coordinates. As distance depends on both coordinates, it may be appropriate to use a joint distribution for these coordinates, as they are not [[Statistical independence|independent]].

In '''tuple uncertainty''', all the attributes of a [[tuple]] are subject to a joint probability distribution. This covers the case of correlated uncertainty, but also includes the case where there is a probability of a tuple not belonging in the relevant relation, which is indicated by all the probabilities not summing to one.&lt;ref name="orion"/&gt; For example, assume we have the following tuple from a [[probabilistic database]]:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
|| (a, 0.4) | (b, 0.5)
|}

Then, the tuple has 10% chance of not existing in the database.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2431">'''ZFOURGE''' or the '''FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey''' is a large and deep medium-band imaging survey which aims to establish an observational benchmark of [[galaxy]] properties at [[redshift]] z &gt; 1. The survey is using a very efficient [[near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infrared]] [[FOURSTAR]] instrument on the [[Magellan Telescopes]], surveying in all three HST legacy fields: COSMOS, CDFS, and UDS.&lt;ref&gt;http://zfourge.tamu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific aims==

ZFOURGE aims to create a benchmark of properties at z &gt; 1 by deriving 1-2% accurate redshifts of ∼60,000 galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3.

While majority of L∗ galaxies are too faint for spectroscopy, which resulted in inaccurate broadband photometric redshifts in the previous times. To mend that FourStar is equipped with innovative "medium-bandwidth" filters from 1 − 1.8μm, which enable redshifts to z = 3.5.

This allows ZFOURGE to observe galaxy samples from the low mass at z &gt; 1, to measure the value of mass and environment in transformation of galaxies, measure galaxy scaling relations. It will also explore the shape of the stellar mass function to z = 3, and find luminous galaxies at z = 6-9, and identify high-redshift 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 (proto)clusters.&lt;ref&gt;http://zfourge.tamu.edu/science/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
The Fourstar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) is conducted using the FourStar imager (Persson et al. 2013) on the 6.5m Magellan Baade telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. It is using medium-band filters in the near-IR (van Dokkum et al. 2009) which allows for samplings at wavelengths that bracket the Balmer break of galaxies leading to more well-constrained photometric redshifts at 1 &lt; z &lt; 4 than with broadband filters alone. This dataset provides a comprehensive sampling of the 0.3 – 8 micron spectral energy distribution of galaxies.

ZFOURGE is composed of three 11′ x 11′ pointings with coverage in the CDFS (Giacconi et al. 2002), COSMOS (Capak et al. 2007) and UDS (Lawrence et al. 2007). The 5sigma depth in a circular aperture of D=0.6" in the Ks band is 26.2-26.5 in the CDFS, COSMOS and UDS fields respectively at a typical seeing of ~0.4″. For more information regarding ZFOURGE consult Straatman et al. (2016).&lt;ref&gt;http://zfourge.tamu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;
