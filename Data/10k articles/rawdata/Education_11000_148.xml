{{Advanced Placement}}
{{Education in the U.S.}}

'''Advanced Placement''' ('''AP''') is a program in the United States and Canada created by the [[College Board]] which offers college-level [[curriculum|curricula]] and examinations to [[high school]] students. American colleges and universities may grant placement and [[course credit]] to students who obtain high scores on the examinations. The AP curriculum for each of the various subjects is created for the College Board by a panel of experts and college-level educators in that [[Discipline (academia)|field of study]]. For a high school course to have the designation, the course must be audited by the College Board to ascertain that it satisfies the AP curriculum. If the course is approved, the school may use the AP designation and the course will be publicly listed on the AP Course Ledger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP Course Ledger|url=https://apcourseaudit.inflexion.org/ledger/|work=AP Course Audit|publisher=University of Oregon|accessdate=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After the end of [[World War II]], the [[Ford Foundation]] created a fund that supported committees studying education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= A Brief History of the Advanced Placement Program| url= http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/ap/ap_history_english.pdf| accessdate= January 29, 2009| publisher= [[College Board]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090205075824/http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/ap/ap_history_english.pdf| archivedate= February 5, 2009| deadurl= yes| df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, which was then referred to as the "Kenyon Plan",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Markers: Kenyon College |url=https://lbis.kenyon.edu/sca/markers/college |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |publisher=[[Kenyon College]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719231345/https://lbis.kenyon.edu/sca/markers/college |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded and pioneered at [[Kenyon College]] in Gambier, Ohio, by the then-college president [[Gordon Chalmers]]. The first study was conducted by three prep schools—the [[Lawrenceville School]], [[Phillips Academy]] and [[Phillips Exeter Academy]]—and three universities—[[Harvard University]], [[Princeton University]] and [[Yale University]]. In 1952 they issued the report ''General Education in School and College: A Committee Report'' which recommended allowing high school seniors to study college level material and to take achievement exams that allowed them to attain college credit for this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Liberal Arts in School and College|author=Stanley N. Katz

 | publisher= [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]
 | accessdate =January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second committee, the Committee on Admission with Advanced Standing, developed and implemented the plan to choose a curriculum. A pilot program was run in 1952 which covered eleven disciplines. In the 1955-56 school year, it was nationally implemented in ten subjects: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English, History, French, German, Spanish, and Latin.

The [[College Board]], a non-profit organization&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/about/index.html About the College Board] from collegeboard.com&lt;/ref&gt; based in New York City, has run the AP program since 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/program/history/8019.html The History of the AP Program] from collegeboard.com&lt;/ref&gt; From 1965 to 1989, [[Harlan Hanson]] was the director of the Advanced Placement Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DiYanni|first=Robert |title=The History of AP Program |url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/21502.html |year=2008 |publisher= CollegeBoard.com |accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It develops and maintains guidelines for the teaching of higher level courses in various subject areas. In addition, it supports teachers of AP courses and supports universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/program/index.html The Advanced Placement Program] from collegeboard.com&lt;/ref&gt; These activities are funded through fees required to take the AP exams.

In 2006, over one million students took over two million Advanced Placement examinations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap06_prog_summary_rpt.pdf Program Summary Report 2006] from collegeboard.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many high schools in the United States offer AP courses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap05_apfactsheet_37491.pdf AP Fact Sheet] from collegeboard.com&lt;/ref&gt; though the College Board allows any student to take any examination regardless of participation in its respective course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/about_faq.html#faq1 AP: Frequently Asked Questions] from collegeboard.com&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[homeschooling|home-schooled]] students and students from schools that do not offer AP courses have an equal opportunity to take AP exams.

As of the 2015 testing season, exams cost $91 each,&lt;ref&gt;https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/takingtheexam/exam-fees&lt;/ref&gt; though the cost may be subsidized by local or state programs. Financial aid is available for students who qualify for it; the exam reduction is $26 or $28 per exam from College Board plus an additional $8 rebate per fee-reduced exam from the school. There may be further reductions depending on the state. Out of the $91, $8 goes directly to the school to pay for the administration of the test, which some schools will reduce to lower the cost to the student.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

On April 3, 2008, the College Board announced that four AP courses—French Literature, Latin Literature, Computer Science AB, and Italian Language and Culture—would be discontinued after the 2008–2009 school year due to lack of funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/04/03/ST2008040303977.html |title= AP Language, Computer Courses Cut |work=The Washington Post |date= April 4, 2008| accessdate=January 21, 2011 | first=Daniel | last=de Vise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/195950.html Important Announcement about AP Italian Language and Culture] from collegeboard.com&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Italian Language and Culture test was again offered beginning in 2011.

Starting July 2013 AP allowed students for the first time to both view and send their scores online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apscores AP Online Scores]&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of AP exams administered each year has seen a steady increase over the past decade. In 2003, 175,860 English Language and Composition exams were administered. By 2013, this number had risen to 476,277, or an increase of 171%. Such an increase has occurred in nearly all AP exams offered, with the AP Psychology exam seeing a 281% increase over the past decade. In 2017, the most taken AP exam was [[AP English Language and Composition|English Language and Composition]] with 579,426 students and the least taken AP exam was [[AP Japanese Language and Culture|Japanese Language and Culture]] with 2,429 students.&lt;ref&gt;https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/research/2017/Student-Score-Distributions-2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The AP exams begin on the first Monday in May and last ten school days (two weeks).

==Scoring==
AP tests are scored on a 1 to 5 scale as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apscore.collegeboard.org/scores/about-ap-scores|title=About AP Scores – The College Board|website=apscore.collegeboard.org|access-date=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''5''' – Extremely well qualified
*'''4''' – Well qualified
*'''3''' – Qualified
*'''2''' – Possibly qualified
*'''1''' – No recommendation
The multiple choice component of the exam is scored by computer, while the free response and essay portions are scored by trained Readers at the AP Reading each June. The scores on various components are weighted and combined into a raw Composite Score. The Chief Reader for each exam then decides on the grade cutoffs for that year's exam, which determine how the Composite Scores are converted into the final grades. During the process a number of reviews and statistical analyses are performed to ensure that the grading is reliable. The overall goal is for the grades to reflect an absolute scale of performance which can be compared from year to year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= AP Central – Exam Scoring | url= http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/1994.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080113162234/http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/1994.html| archivedate=January 13, 2008| publisher=[[College Board]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some colleges use AP test scores to exempt students from introductory coursework, others use them to place students in higher designated courses, and some do both. Each college's policy is different, but most require a minimum score of 3 or 4 to receive college credit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pathaspire.com/standardized/ap/ap/1/ Understanding AP Exams] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908231132/http://pathaspire.com/standardized/ap/ap/1/ |date=September 8, 2008 }} from PathAspire.com&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, this appears as a "CR" grade on the college transcript, although some colleges and universities will award an A grade for a 5 score.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/212187.html Multiple-Choice Scores] from collegeboard.com&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries, such as Germany, that do not offer general admission to their universities and colleges for holders of an American high school diploma without preparatory courses will directly admit students who have completed a specific set of AP tests, depending on the subject they wish to study there.

In addition, completing AP courses help students qualify for various types of scholarships. According to the College Board, 31 percent of colleges and universities look at AP experience when making scholarship decisions.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://professionals.collegeboard.com/k-12/assessment/ap/ |title=AP Program |publisher=College Board |accessdate=August 5, 2012}}, citing "Unpublished institutional research, Crux Research, Inc. March 2007."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the May 2011 AP Exam administration, the College Board changed the scoring method of AP Exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Guess What? Taking AP Exams Just Got Easier | publisher = ParentDish | year = 2010 | url = http://www.parentdish.com/2010/08/12/guess-what-taking-ap-exams-just-got-easier/|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/11/ap-eliminates-guessing-pe_n_678757.html |work=HuffPost | first=Leah | last=Finnegan | title=AP Eliminates Guessing Penalty On Tests | date=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total scores on the multiple-choice section are now based on the number of questions answered correctly. Points are no longer deducted for incorrect answers and, as was the case before, no points are awarded for unanswered questions. However, scoring requirements have also been increased.

==Score reporting==
Starting with the May 2013 AP Examination Administration, the College Board launched an Internet-based score reporting service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Score Reporting Services|url=http://www.apscore.org/schedule.html|publisher=[[College Board]]|accessdate=July 4, 2013|pages=1|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can use their 2013 AP Number or Student Number (if one was indicated) along with a College Board Account,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Create a CollegeBoard Account|url=https://account.collegeboard.org/iamweb/smartRegister|publisher=[[College Board]]|accessdate=July 4, 2013|pages=1|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to access current and previous years' exam scores. This system can also be used to send scores to colleges and universities for which a four-digit institutional code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of 4-digit Institutional Codes, PDF|url=http://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/gre_aidi_fellowships.pdf|publisher=[[Educational Testing Service]]|accessdate=July 4, 2013|pages=1|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is assigned.

==Exam subsidies==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Recognizing that the cost could be an impediment to students of limited means, a number of states and municipalities independent of the [[College Board]] have partially or fully subsidized the cost. For example, the state of Florida reimburses schools districts for the exam costs of students enrolled in Advanced Placement courses. The [[Los Angeles Unified School District]], the [[Montebello Unified School District]], the [[Hawaii Department of Education]], [[New York City Department of Education]], and the state of Indiana subsidize all AP Examination fees in subjects of math and science, and the [[Edmonds School District]] in suburban Seattle currently subsidizes Advanced Placement fees of students who enroll in the free school lunch program. In addition, some school districts offer free tests to all students enrolled in any Advanced Placement class.

==Advanced Placement courses==
There are currently 38 courses and exams available through the AP Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/index.html|title=AP Central - Course Home Pages|website=apcentral.collegeboard.com|access-date=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complete list of courses can be found below:

One issue to consider is the fact that not all AP students take their course's test. The College Board estimates that about 2/3 of students enrolled in an AP course take the course's AP test.&lt;ref name="College Board, 2001"&gt;{{cite web|last1=College Board|title=Access to excellence: A report of the commission on the future of the Advanced Placement Program|url=http://research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012/7/misc2001-2-future-advanced-placement.pdf|publisher=Author|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a study of University of California system students found that only about 55% to 60% of AP students took their course's exam.&lt;ref name="Geiser &amp; Santelices, 2004"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geiser|first1=Saul|last2=Santelices|first2=Veronica|title=The role of Advanced Placement and honors courses in college admissions|url=http://www.cshe.berkeley.edu/publications/role-advanced-placement-and-honors-courses-college-admissions|publisher=Center for Studies in Higher Education, University of California|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, "It has recently become clear . . . that these estimations of overall participation rates mask the variability in participation rates across AP examinations."&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F2158244016682996 |last1=Warne|first1=R. T.|title=Research on the academic benefits of the Advanced Placement Program: Taking stock and looking forward|journal=SAGE Open|year=2017|volume=7|issue=1|page=9|doi=10.1177/2158244016682996|accessdate=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one study of math and science AP courses showed that participation rates were 52.7% for AP Chemistry, 53.6% for AP Physics, 57.7% for AP Biology, and 77.4% for AP Calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadler|first1=P. M.|last2=Sonnert|first2=G.|last3=Hazari|first3=Z.|last4=Tai|first4=R.|title=The role of advanced high school coursework in increasing STEM career interest|journal=Science Educator|year=2014|volume=23|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest study on this topic found similar participation rates (49.5% for AP Chemistry, 52.3% for AP Physics, 54.5% for Biology, and 68.9% for Calculus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=R. T.|title=Research on the academic benefits of the Advanced Placement Program: Taking stock and looking forward |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F2158244016682996 |journal=SAGE Open|year=2017|volume=7|issue=1|page=9|doi=10.1177/2158244016682996|accessdate=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; History exams tend to have slightly higher participation rates (57.9% for AP European History, 58.5% for AP World History, and 62.8% for AP U.S. History), and 65.4% of AP English students took either the AP English Language or AP English Literature exam.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt; This same study found that for "core AP subjects (i.e., no arts or language subjects)", the overall test participation rate was 60.8%.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;

In February 2014 College Board released data from the previous ten years of AP exams. College Board found that 33.2% of public high school graduates from the class of 2013 had taken an AP exam, compared to 18.9% in 2003. In 2013 20.1% of graduates who had taken an AP test achieved a 3 or higher compared to 12.2% in 2003.

==Criticism==

===Decreasing quality===
In the 21st century, independent educational researchers began to question whether AP could maintain high academic standards while experiencing explosive growth.&lt;ref name="Lichten, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lichten|first1=William|title=Whither Advanced Placement|journal=Education Policy Analysis Archives|year=2000|volume=8|issue=29|url=http://epaa.asu.edu/ojs/article/view/420|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that the most popular AP tests tend to have the lowest passing rates, a possible indication that less academically prepared students are enrolling in AP classes.&lt;ref name="Warne, 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=R. T.|title=Research on the academic benefits of the Advanced Placement program: Taking stock and looking forward |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F2158244016682996 |journal=SAGE Open|year=2017|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1177/2158244016682996|accessdate=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the AP program can serve large numbers of students without decreasing academic rigor is a matter of debate within the education field.&lt;ref name="Lichten, 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lichten, 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lichten|first1=William|editor1-last=Sadler|editor1-first=P. M.|editor2-last=Sonnert|editor2-first=G.|editor3-last=Tai|editor3-first=R. H.|editor4-last=Klopfenstein|editor4-first=K.|title=AP: A critical examination of the Advanced Placement program|date=2010|publisher=Harvard Education Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=233–243|chapter=Whither Advanced Placement--now?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passing scores and university credit===
University faculty, such as former professor and high school teacher John Tierney, have expressed doubts about the value of a passing AP score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tireny|first1=John|title=AP Classes Are a Scam|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/ap-classes-are-a-scam/263456/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who receive scores of 3 or 4 are being given college credit at fewer universities.{{When|date=June 2016}} Academic departments also criticise the increasing proportion of students who take and pass AP courses but are not ready for college-level work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zimar |first1=Heather |year=2005 |title=Universities Raise Standards for Earning Advanced Placement Credit |journal=SEM Source: An Update on State of the Art Student Services |issue=January 2005 |publisher=American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers |url=http://www2.aacrao.org/sem/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=2439 |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729064348/http://www2.aacrao.org/sem/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=2439 |archivedate=July 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic achievement===
Independent researchers in education have since 2010 studied the impact of the Advanced Placement program on students' academic achievement. An early study published in ''AP: A critical examination of the Advanced Placement program'' found that students who took AP courses in the sciences but failed the AP exam performed no better in college science courses than students without any AP course at all. Referring to students who complete the course but fail the exam, the head researcher, Phillip M. Sadler, stated in an interview that "research shows that they don't appear to have learned anything during the year, so there is probably a better course for them".&lt;ref name="hood"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hood |first1=Lucy |last2=Sadler |first2=Philip M. |year=2010 |title=Putting AP to the Test: New research assesses the Advanced Placement program |journal=Harvard Education Letter |volume=26 |issue=May/June 2010 |url=http://www.hepg.org/hel/article/466#home |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other studies compared non-AP students with AP students who had not taken their course's AP exam, had taken the AP exam but did not pass it, or had passed the AP exam. Like Sadler's study, both found that AP students who passed their exam scored highest in other measures of academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ackerman|first1=Phillip|last2=Kanfer|first2=Ruth|last3=Calderwood|first3=Charles|title=High school Advanced Placement and student performance in college: STEM majors, non-STEM majors, and gender differences|journal=Teachers College Record|year=2013|volume=115|issue=10|pages=1–43|ref=Ackerman et al. (2013)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest study of this sort, with a sample size of over 90,000, replicated these results and also showed that non-AP students performed with equal levels of academic achievement as AP students who did not take their course's AP exam—even after controlling for over 70 intervening variables.&lt;ref name="Warne et al. (2015)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|last2=Larsen|first2=Ross|last3=Anderson|first3=Braydon|last4=Odasso|first4=Alyce J.|title=The impact of participation in the Advanced Placement program on students' college admissions test scores|journal=The Journal of Educational Research|year=2015|volume=108|issue=5|pages=400–416|doi=10.1080/00220671.2014.917253|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00220671.2014.917253}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led the authors to state that AP participation "... is not beneficial to students who merely enroll in the courses ..."&lt;ref name="Warne et al. (2015)" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:p.&amp;nbsp;414&lt;/sup&gt;

===School quality===
Several states use Advanced Placement data for accountability purposes, and [[U.S. News and World Report]] use data on Advanced Placement course offerings and participation to rank high schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morse|first1=Robert|title=How U.S. News Calculated the 2015 Best High Schools Rankings|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/articles/how-us-news-calculated-the-rankings|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies of local school districts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lichten|first1=William|title=Whither Advanced Placement--now|date=2010|publisher=Harvard Education Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=233–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States as a whole&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell|last2=Anderson|first2=Braydon|title=The Advanced Placement program's impact on academic achievement|journal=New Educational Foundations|issue=4|pages=32–54|url=http://www.newfoundations.com/NEFpubs/NEF4sum2015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that increasing AP participation does not increase the overall academic achievement or school quality at the group (e.g., high school, racial/ethnic group, nation) level. This led one researcher to state, "Clearly, offering AP alone will not magically turn a failing school into a successful one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|title=Pushing students to take Advanced Placement courses does not help anyone|url=https://theconversation.com/pushing-students-to-take-advanced-placement-courses-does-not-help-anyone-45350|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9779">The '''Anonymous Was A Woman Award''' is a program that awards grants to women artists who are over 40 years of age, in part to counter sexism in the art world.&lt;ref name=awawa /&gt;&lt;ref name=dobrzynski /&gt; It began in 1996 in direct response to the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]' decision to stop funding individual artists.&lt;ref name=dobrzynski /&gt;

The award comes with a grant of $25,000 and is designed to enable exceptional woman artists to further develop their work. Awardees are chosen on the basis of their past accomplishments, their originality and artistic growth, and the quality of their work.&lt;ref name=awawa /&gt; Since 1996, some 220 women have received the award and approximately 5.5 million USD has been awarded in total.&lt;ref name=awawa /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes_profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/arts/design/susan-unterberg-artist-grant.html|title=She Gave Millions to Artists Without Credit. Until Now.|last=Pogrebin|first=Robin|date=2018-07-20|website=New York Times|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award was founded by a New York artist who originally chose to remain anonymous.&lt;ref name=dobrzynski /&gt; She named the award in reference to a line from [[Virginia Woolf]]’s book ''[[A Room of One’s Own]]''&lt;ref name=awawa /&gt; and in recognition of all the women artists through the ages who have remained anonymous for various reasons.&lt;ref name=dobrzynski /&gt; Nominators, who include art writers, curators, art historians, and previous winners, are likewise unnamed.&lt;ref name=awawa /&gt;

In July 2018, the artist [[Susan Unterberg]] was revealed as both the founder and funder of the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/07/susan-unterberg-anonymous-was-a-woman.html|title=Woman Who Anonymously Gave Millions to Female Artists Reveals Herself|last=Nechamkin|first=Sarah|date=2018-07-20|website=The Cut|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2018, she had remained anonymous so that her artwork would be evaluated in its own context, without being influenced by her contributions.&lt;ref name="nytimes_profile" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/susan-unterberg-on-anonymous-was-a-woman-1322450|title='The Reaction Has Been Overwhelming': Susan Unterberg Comes Forward as a Major Anonymous Patron of Female Artists|last=Cascone|first=Sarah|date=2018-07-25|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, she described her reasons for coming forward, stating "It’s a great time for women to speak up. I feel I can be a better advocate having my own voice," and that she can now work openly to further the organization's cause and to encourage philanthropists and women artists.&lt;ref name="nytimes_profile" /&gt; On top of the awarded grants, Unterberg is considering other forms of programs, possibly seminars, to complement the grants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1359">In Canada, a new occupational category of "technologist" was established in the 1960s in conjunction with an emerging system of community colleges and [[Institute of technology|technical institutes]].  It was designed to effectively bridge the gap between the increasingly theoretical nature of engineering science degrees and the predominantly practical approach of [[technician]] and trades programs.  Provincial associations may certify individuals as a [[Professional Technologist]] (P.Tech), [[Certified Engineering Technologist]] (C.E.T.), [[Registered Engineering Technologist|Registered Engineering Technologist (R.E.T.)]], [[Applied Science Technologist]] (AScT) or Technologue Professionel [T.P.].  These provincial associations are constituent members of the [[Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists]] (CCTT), which nationally accredits technology programs across Canada through its [[Canadian Technology Accreditation Board]] (CTAB).  Nationally accredited engineering technology programs range from two to three years in length, depending on province, with two-year programs leading to a C.Tech. certification and three-year programs usually leading to an AScT, CET or RET certification.

'''BRICS Universities League''' is a [[consortium]] of leading research universities from [[BRICS]] countries including [[Brazil]], [[Russia]], [[India]], [[China]], and  [[South Africa]]. Initiated in [[Shanghai]] on July 6, 2013, the League aims to become a platform for academic and expert cooperation, comparative research, and international educational projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.ru/en/news/community/90343147.html BRICS League of Universities]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, around 40 outstanding universities from the five BRICS countries gathered in Beijing Normal University to hold the BRICS Universities Presidents Forum. After this Forum, the participating universities declared the Beijing Consensus, and they decided to establish the BRICS Universities League. The League Secretariat is located in Beijing Normal University, with the BNU as a leading university in terms of BRICS higher education and academic cooperation. The League is expanding to attract more and more outstanding BRICS universities to participate in its activities. The BRICS Universities League has performed as a strategic pillar for the BRICS cooperation.

On January 31, DeVos's nomination was approved by the committee on a 12–11 party-line vote and was due to be voted on by the Senate.&lt;ref name="hill-committee-approves"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hagen|first1=Lisa|title=Senate committee approves DeVos nomination |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/317044-senate-committee-approves-devos-nomination|accessdate=January 31, 2017|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=January 31, 2017|quote="The Senate [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions]] (HELP) on Tuesday morning approved Betsy DeVos's nomination to lead the Department of Education.

Ahead of the scheduled final vote at noon on February 7, 2017, the Democrats in the Senate continuously spoke on the floor against the confirmation of DeVos the entire night before leading up to the vote, in protest of their strong disapproval of the nominee.&lt;ref name="hill-protest"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carney|first1=Jordain|title=Democrats plan all-night protest ahead of DeVos vote |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/318083-democrats-plan-all-night-protest-ahead-of-devos-vote|website=The Hill |accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As expected, there was a 50–50 tie on the final vote, with all Democrats and independents, along with two Republicans ([[Susan Collins]] and [[Lisa Murkowski]]), voting in opposition to DeVos, while the other fifty Republican senators voted in support of the confirmation, including Senator [[Jeff Sessions]], who himself had been nominated by the Trump administration for the post of [[United States Attorney General]]. Republicans scheduled Sessions's confirmation vote after DeVos's so that he would be able to cast his vote in support of DeVos.

=== Tenure ===
On February 10, 2017, as DeVos made a visit to Jefferson Academy, a public middle school located in [[Southwest, Washington, D.C.]], in her first official appearance as Secretary at a [[District of Columbia Public Schools|D.C. public school]], dozens of protesters showed up to prevent her appearance and physically blocked her from entering through the back entrance of the school.

Education Department officials declined requests for information about the deployment of marshals or the current tasks of the Secretary's displaced security team normally assigned to her. Many of those security personnel are former Secret Service agents who have worked at the department for many years. Regarding the withdrawal of the department's team, former Education Secretary [[Arne Duncan]] said, "That's a waste of taxpayer money," Duncan said of the use of U.S. Marshals. DeVos said that on the basis of her first few days in the job, she had concerns that some Education Department employees were sympathetic to the Obama administration. "I . . . would not be surprised if there are also those that would try to subvert the mission of this organization and this department," she stated. Asked what she could do about that, she said, "Whatever can be done will be done, and it will be done swiftly and surely."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/betsy-devos-is-now-being-guarded-by-us-marshals/2017/02/17/7dc341f4-f54b-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html Betsy DeVos being guarded by U.S. Marshals Service] m, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Danielle Douglas-Gabriel &amp; Emma Brown, February 17, 2017.

On February 27, 2017, DeVos released a statement calling [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black colleges]] "real pioneers when it comes to school choice", causing controversy as some pointed out the schools originated after segregation laws prevented African-Americans from attending others. DeVos later acknowledged racism as an important factor in the history of historically black colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/betsy-devos-hbcu-historically-black-colleges-235498|title=DeVos sparks controversy with comments on black colleges|date=February 28, 2017|first=Benjamin|last=Wermund |publisher=CNN|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 2017, during a visit to the Osceola County campus of [[Valencia College]], DeVos said she was considering the extension of federal financial aid for students that were year-round and interested in placing more focus on community colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/school-zone/os-betsy-devos-valencia-campus-20170322-story.html|title=Education Secretary Betsy Devos tours Valencia campus in Osceola|date=March 24, 2017|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|first=Gabrielle|last=Russon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 2017, DeVos delivered her first extended policy address at the [[Brookings Institution]], stating an interest in implementing choice policies directed toward children as individuals and criticizing the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration's additional funding of $7&amp;nbsp;billion for the U.S.'s worst-performing schools as "throwing money at the problem" in an attempt to find a solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/us/politics/betsy-devos-education-school-choice-voucher.html|title=Betsy DeVos Calls for More School Choice, Saying Money Isn't the Answer|date=March 29, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Erica L.|last=Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 2017, DeVos visited [[Florida International University]], marking her first visit to a public university, where she toured an area designed to resemble a hospital ward and was confronted by around 30 protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/04/06/devos-visits-her-first-public-university-and-faces-protesters-in-miami/ |title=In Miami, DeVos visits first public university since becoming education secretary, faces protesters |first=Susan |last=Svrluga|date=April 6, 2017|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals Service]] said after a threat evaluation was conducted in February that DeVos would be given additional security, projecting a cost of $7.8&amp;nbsp;million between February and September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/04/07/us/politics/ap-us-devos-security.html?_r=0 |title=Additional Security for DeVos May Cost Up to $7.8 Million|date=April 7, 2017|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 2017, DeVos undid several Obama administration policy memos issued by [[John King Jr.]] and Ted Mitchell which were designed to protect student loan borrowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-betsy-devos-student-loan-protections-20170411-story.html|title=Betsy DeVos undoes Obama's student loan protections|date=April 11, 2017|first=Danielle Douglas|last=Gabriel|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, DeVos praised the President's nomination of [[Carlos G. Muñiz]] as the Department's [[general counsel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Erica L.|title=2 Education Dept.

On May 10, 2017, DeVos gave a [[commencement speech]] at [[Bethune–Cookman University]], a [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black college]], and during her speech a majority of the students booed DeVos, with about half of them standing up and turning their backs to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/05/10/alumni-others-deliver-petitions-demanding-historically-black-university-drop-betsy-devos-as-commencement-speaker/|title=Students boo Betsy DeVos as commencement speaker at historically black university|author=Susan Svrluga|website=The Washington Post|date=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from Bethune–Cookman University.

On May 22, 2017, DeVos announced the Trump administration was offering "the most ambitious expansion" of school choice within American history. DeVos cited [[Indiana]] (which has the U.S.'s largest [[school voucher]] program) as a potential model for a nationwide policy, but did not give specific proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/05/22/devos-pushes-school-choice-gives-no-specifics/ |title= Betsy DeVos pushes school choice in speech to advocacy group, gives no specifics |first=Maria |last=Danilova |date= May 22, 2017 |publisher= Denver Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 2017 House of Representatives committee hearing, Rep. Katherine Clark, said an Indiana private school which takes publicly funded vouchers maintains it is entitled to deny admission to LGBT students or those coming from families with "homosexual or bisexual activity." Clark asked if she would inform Indiana that it could not discriminate in that way if it accepted federal funding, and asked her how she would respond in the event a voucher school rejected black students but a state "said it was okay." DeVos answered: "Well again, the Office of Civil Rights and our Title IX protections are broadly applicable across the board, but when it comes to parents making choices on behalf of their students..." Clark stopped her saying, "This isn't about parents making choices, this is about the use of federal dollars. Is there any situation? Would you say to Indiana, that school cannot discriminate against LGBT students if you want to receive federal dollars? Or would you say the state has the flexibility?" DeVos responded: "I believe states should continue to have flexibility in putting together programs ..."&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-betsy-devos-education-20180312-story.html Analysis: 9 controversial - and highly revealing - things Betsy DeVos has said], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Valerie Strauss, March 12, Retrieved March 13, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; CBS reporter [[Lesley Stahl]] questioned her, in a March 2018 ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview, about the documented failure of the DeVos programs to demonstrate a positive result, in Michigan, her home state: "Your argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better is not working in Michigan ... where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system." Stahl added, "The public schools here are doing worse than they did."

On July 6, 2017, Democratic attorneys-general in 18 states and Washington, D.C., led by Massachusetts' attorney-general [[Maura Healey]], filed a federal lawsuit against DeVos for suspending the implementation of rules that were meant to protect students attending for-profit colleges. The rules, developed during the Obama administration, were meant to take effect on July 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cowley|first1=Stacy|title=18 States Sue Betsy DeVos Over Student Loan Protections |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/business/dealbook/massachusetts-betsy-devos-lawsuit.html?mcubz=1|accessdate=July 18, 2017 |work=The New York Times|date=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-6jul2017"&gt;{{cite news |title= Eighteen states sue Betsy DeVos for suspending rules on for-profit colleges |url= https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/06/betsy-devos-lawsuit-for-profit-colleges |accessdate=July 6, 2017 |agency= Associated Press |newspaper=The Guardian |date= July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 2017, [[Candice Jackson]], who is a sexual assault survivor, organized a meeting with DeVos, college sexual assault victims, accused assailants, and higher education officials, and said she would look at policies on sexual assault accusations on campuses from the Obama administration to see if accused students were treated within their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Green |first1=Erica L. |last2= Stolberg |first2= Sheryl Gay |title= Campus Rape Policies Get a New Look as the Accused Get DeVos's Ear |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/us/politics/campus-rape-betsy-devos-title-iv-education-trump-candice-jackson.html |accessdate= July 14, 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date= July 13, 2017 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked by [[CBS]] ''[[60 Minutes]]'' reporter [[Lesley Stahl]] about her repeal of [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration guidelines for colleges dealing with reports of sexual assaults, she said her concern was for men falsely accused of such assaults. "Survivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved," said DeVos.&lt;ref name=Post&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/03/12/education-secretary-betsy-devos-stumbles-during-pointed-60-minutes-interview/ Education Secretary Betsy DeVos stumbles during pointed ‘60 Minutes’ interview],''[[The Washington Post]]'', Valerie Strauss, March 12, Retrieved March 13, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tribune /&gt;

In October 2017, DeVos revoked 72 [[Administrative guidance|guidance documents]] of the [[Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services]] which outlined the rights of disabled students under the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] and the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973|Rehabilitation Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Moriah Balingit, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/10/21/devos-rescinds-72-guidance-documents-outlining-rights-for-disabled-students/ DeVos rescinds 72 guidance documents outlining rights for disabled students], ''The Washington Post'' (October 21, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, Devos said in a speech that the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT) found that "60 percent of its teachers reported having moderate to no influence over the content and skills taught in their own classrooms." In response, AFT noted that in the same survey of around 5,000 educators, 86% felt that Devos had disrespected them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chapman |first1=Matthew |title=Betsy DeVos accidentally promotes study showing teachers feel disrespected – by her|url=https://shareblue.com/betsy-devos-accidentally-promotes-study-showing-teachers-feel-disrespected-by-her/|publisher=[[Shareblue Media]]|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, DeVos announced a School Safety Commission, to provide meaningful and actionable recommendations. Members were four Cabinet members, including herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-devos-forms-school-safety-commission|title=Secretary DeVos Forms School Safety Commission {{!}} U.S. Department of Education|website=www.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization held a meeting on March 28 and a gathering of school shooting survivors and families on April 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/education-secretary-betsy-devos-says-federal-school-safety-commission-will-n876446|title=Education Secretary Betsy DeVos says school safety commission will issue 'best practices' by year's end|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-May 2018, ''The New York Times'' reported that under DeVos, the size of the team investigating abuses and fraud by for-profit colleges was reduced from about twelve members under the Obama administration to three, with their task also being scaled back to "processing student loan forgiveness applications and looking at smaller compliance cases". DeVos also appointed Julian Schmoke as the team's new supervisor; Schmoke was a former dean of DeVry Education Group, which was one of the institutions the team had been investigating. The investigation into DeVry was not the only one stopped, others include those of Bridgepoint Education and Career Education Corporation. The Education Department has hired more ex-employees and people affiliated with those institutions, such as Robert S. Eitel, senior counselor to DeVos, Diane Auer Jones, an advisor to the Department, and Carlos G. Muñiz, the Department's general counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ivory|first1=Danielle|last2=Green|first2=Erica|last3=Eder|first3=Steve|title=Education Department Unwinds Unit Investigating Fraud at For-Profits|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/13/business/education-department-for-profit-colleges.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also reported by several news outlets was a sequence of payments made by DeVry to the DeVos Foundation.

In late May 2018, Devos said that she believed it was "a school decision" on whether to report a student's family to the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) if the student or their family are undocumented immigrants. However, under ''[[Plyler v. Doe]]'', the American Supreme Court ruled under the American constitution, schools are obligated to provide schooling irrespective of immigration status. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] has said that because of this, it would be unconstitutional for schools to report students or their families to ICE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balingit|first1=Moriah|title='Astounding ignorance of the law': Civil rights groups slam DeVos for saying schools can report undocumented students|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2018/05/23/astounding-ignorance-of-the-law-civil-rights-groups-slam-devos-for-saying-schools-can-report-undocumented-students|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeVos was listed for many years on IRS form [[Form 990]]s as the foundation's vice president (hitherto called the Edgar and Elsa Prince Foundation). However, she testified under oath in the Senate [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee]] hearing, in response to Senator [[Maggie Hassan]]'s questions, that she had nothing to do with the contributions made by her mother's foundation to conservative advocacy groups including [[Focus on the Family]] and the [[Family Research Council]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://theintercept.com/2017/01/18/trump-education-nominee-betsy-devos-lied-to-the-senate/ Trump Education nominee Betsy DeVos lied to the Senate]".

After the announcement of the DeVoses'&lt;!--this is a plural possessive--&gt; gift to the Kennedy Center, DeVos explained that she had been persuaded by Kennedy Center official [[Michael Kaiser]]'s observation that millions of dollars are invested "in the arts, and training artists", but not in "training the leaders who hire the artists and run the organizations". The DeVoses'&lt;!--this is a plural possessive--&gt; gift was intended to remedy this oversight.

==== School choice ====
DeVos believes education in the United States should encourage the proliferation of [[Charter schools in the United States|charter schools]] and open up [[private school]]s to more students via financial assistance programs, often called vouchers. She has stated that education is "a closed system, a closed industry, a closed market.

DeVos was chair of the American Federation for Children (AFC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klein|first1=Alyson|title=Betsy DeVos to Address American Federation for Children|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2017/05/betsy_devos_to_address_america.html |accessdate=May 29, 2017|publisher=EdWeek|date=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affiliated with the [[Alliance for School Choice]], the AFC describes itself as "a leading national advocacy organization promoting school choice, with a specific focus on advocating for school vouchers and scholarship tax credit programs".&lt;ref name="AFCmission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federationforchildren.org/mission|title=Our Mission|publisher=American Federation for Children|accessdate=July 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806150331/http://www.federationforchildren.org/mission|archive-date=August 6, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, she served on the boards of Children First America and the American Education Reform Council, which sought to expand school choice through vouchers and tax credits. She and her husband worked for the successful passage of Michigan's first charter-school bill in 1993,&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; and for the unsuccessful effort in 2000 to amend Michigan's constitution to allow tax-credit scholarships or vouchers. In response to that defeat, DeVos started a PAC, the Great Lakes Education Project, which championed charter schools. DeVos's husband and [[John T. Walton|John Walton]] then founded All Children Matter, a political organization, which she chaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/awards/mostinfluentialwomen/3407066/Betsy-DeVos | title=100 Most Influential Women: Betsy DeVos | publisher=Crain's Detroit | date=September 26, 2016 |access-date=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Detroit charter school system ====
DeVos has been an advocate for the Detroit [[charter school]] system. Douglas N. Harris, professor of economics at [[Tulane University]], wrote in a 2016 ''The New York Times'' [[op-ed]] that DeVos was partly responsible for "what even charter advocates acknowledge is the biggest school reform disaster in the country". In the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]], Detroit had the lowest reading and mathematics scores "by far" over any city participating in the evaluation. According to Harris, she designed a system with no oversight in which schools that do poorly can continue to enroll students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/opinion/betsy-devos-and-the-wrong-way-to-fix-schools.html|title=Betsy DeVos and the Wrong Way to Fix Schools|last=Harris|first=Douglas N.|date=November 25, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ramesh Ponnuru]] of ''[[National Review]]'' argued that Harris overstates the failure of charter schools in Detroit. According to Ponnuru, the study referenced by Harris, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, did "not sound nearly as helpful to Harris's case as he suggests". Ponnuru pointed out that the study says "some 47 percent of charter schools in Detroit significantly outperform[ed] traditional public schools in reading and 49 percent of charters significantly outperforming traditionals on math. Only one percent of charters were significantly outperformed by traditional public schools in reading and only 7 percent on math."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/442522/devos-and-detroits-charter-schools|title=DeVos and Detroit's Charter Schools|newspaper=National Review|access-date=February 6, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also defending DeVos's record in Michigan, [[Jay P. Greene]], professor of education policy at the [[University of Arkansas]], argued that Harris's ''The New York Times'' article misled readers on the evidence and "falsely claimed that Detroit has failed to close failing charter schools", noting that Detroit has closed more charters than Louisiana, a state Harris cites as a model for charter school legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.educationnext.org/when-evidence-and-science-are-really-just-assumptions-and-ideology/ |title=When Evidence and Science are Really Just Assumptions and Ideology | first1=Jay | last1=Greene |date=December 6, 2016|newspaper=Education Next|author-link1=Jay P. Greene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a written response to a question about charter school performance posed during DeVos's confirmation hearing by Senator [[Patty Murray]] (D-WA), asking "why do you think their performance is so poor?", DeVos defended the charter school system using graduation rates that were significantly higher than those used for state and federal accountability purposes. DeVos provided examples of several charter schools that she said had 4-year graduation exceeding 90%. These examples were contested by [[Columbia University]] professor Aaron Pallas and ''[[Education Week]]'' reporter Ben Herold on the basis that the actual graduation rates were roughly only half as large as DeVos had stated.&lt;ref name="NPR_020417"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turner|first1=Cory|title=Betsy DeVos' Graduation Rate Mistake |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/02/04/513220220/betsy-devos-graduation-rate-mistake |accessdate= February 4, 2017 |publisher= [[National Public Radio]] |date= February 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EW_020117"&gt;{{cite news |last=Herold |first= Benjamin |title= Betsy DeVos Used Cherry-Picked Graduation Rates for Cyber Charters |url= http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2017/02/devos_cites_inflated_numbers_k12_inc_cyber_charters.html?cmp=SOC-SHR-twitter |accessdate= February 4, 2017 |publisher=[[Education Week]] |date= February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Grading system ====
[[File:Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump with students, March 2017.jpg|thumb|DeVos and Donald Trump with students in Florida]]
DeVos and [[Joel Klein]] said in a May 2013 op-ed that residents of Maine "are now given information on school performance using easy-to-understand report cards with the same A, B, C, D and F designations used in [[Academic grading in the United States|student grades]]". This system, they argued, "truly motivates parents and the community to get involved by simply taking information that education officials have had for years and presenting it in a way that is more easily understood."&lt;ref name="Transparency"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Joel |last1=Klein |first2=Betsy |last2=Devos |title=A–F grades promote transparency and parental involvement |url=http://www.excelined.org/news/joel-klein-and-betsy-devos-a-f-grades-promote-transparency-and-parental-involvement/ |date=May 25, 2013 |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203060608/http://www.excelined.org/news/joel-klein-and-betsy-devos-a-f-grades-promote-transparency-and-parental-involvement/ |archive-date=December 3, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Betsy and Dick DeVos Scholars for Free Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Scholarship ====
The DeVoses have also established an annual scholarship, called the Betsy and Dick DeVos Scholars for Free Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Scholarship, which is awarded to students earning a [[Bachelor of Business Administration|BBA]] or combined BBA/MBA at [[Northwood University]].&lt;ref name="NUscholarship"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Northwood University]] |title=Six Future Northwood University Students Receive the Betsy and Dick DeVos Scholarship for Free Enterprise and Entrepreneurship |url=https://blogs.northwood.edu/news/2015/04/22/six-northwood-university-students-receive-the-betsy-and-dick-devos-scholarship-for-free-enterprise-and-entrepreneurship/ | date=April 22, 2015 | accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5357">A '''calendar''' (sometimes historically spelled '''kalendar''') is, in the context of [[archival science]], [[textual scholarship]], and archival publication, a descriptive list of [[document]]s. The verb ''to calendar'' means to compile or edit such a list. The word is used differently in Britain and North America with regard to the amount of detail expected: in Britain, it implies a detailed summary which can be used as a substitute for the full text; whereas in North America it implies a more basic inventory.

The term derives from a (now somewhat archaic) word meaning a list or register of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|calendar, n. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the documents in a calendar are generally arranged in chronological order, the term has no direct relationship to a [[Calendar|table of dates]].

==British tradition==
In the British tradition, the word normally implies a full descriptive summary (often published) in which each document is the subject of a "carefully controlled, rigorously consistent précis".&lt;ref name=harvey&gt;Harvey 2001, pp. 56–59.&lt;/ref&gt; All significant elements in the text are recorded, so that the great majority of researchers will be spared the need to consult the originals: the completed calendar effectively becomes a substitute for the archival documents, and is often treated as a [[primary source]] in its own right. Trivial or incidental elements ("common form and unnecessary verbiage") are omitted;&lt;ref name=harvey/&gt; but all names, dates and significant statements are noted, and passages which appear to the editor to be of particular interest or importance may be quoted in full.&lt;ref&gt;Hunnisett 1977, pp. 52–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Documents in archaic or foreign languages (particularly Latin) are normally calendared in the modern vernacular, but significant or ambiguous terms or passages may be given in the original language. A calendar is therefore less detailed or comprehensive than a series of full transcripts or translations; but considerably more detailed than an archival list or other [[finding aid]].

Calendars are at their most useful when published, giving remote users access to the contents of archival records. Well-known series of published calendars of British medieval and [[Early modern period|early modern]] sources include the ''[[Charter Roll|Calendar of Charter Rolls]]'' (1903–1927); the ''[[Close Roll|Calendar of Close Rolls]]'' (1900–1963); the ''[[Patent Rolls|Calendar of Patent Rolls]]'' (1891–); the ''Calendars of State Papers'' (Domestic and Foreign) (1856–); the ''Calendars of Treasury Books and Papers'' (1868–1962) (all from material now in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]); the ''Calendars of Entries in the Papal Registers relating to Great Britain and Ireland'' (published by the [[Public Record Office]] 1896–1960, and by the [[Irish Manuscripts Commission]] 1978–); the ''[[Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII]]'' (1864–1932); and the "Reports and Calendars" series on privately held archives published between 1869 and 2004 by the [[Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts]].

One advantage of calendars in the era of print publishing was that a précis of a text took up less space than a full transcript or [[facsimile]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunnisett 1977, pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt; This reasoning carries less weight in the age of electronic publishing; but calendars still have a role in providing readers with an accurate, comprehensive and accessible summary of a document which may be more readily comprehensible than a more faithful and complete version of the original.

Paul Harvey emphasises that the editorial task of calendaring "is not the soft option that editors have sometimes assumed"; and that the process of summarising accurately without error or distortion can be "significantly harder than straightforward editing".&lt;ref name=harvey/&gt;

==North American tradition==
In the North American tradition, a "calendar" generally implies a briefer and more summary list or inventory than in Britain, arranged chronologically. Its intention is to provide a succinct indication of the documents' date, origin and subject-matter, but little more; and it is designed as a [[finding aid]] to locate the originals, not as a substitute for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/c/calendar |title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology |accessdate=2013-02-02 |publisher=[[Society of American Archivists]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevens and Burg 1997, pp. 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4318">'''Corporate Education''' refers to a system of [[professional development]] activities provided to educate employees.  It may consist of formal [[university]] or [[college]] training or informal training provided by non-collegiate institutions.  The simplest form of corporate education may be training programs designed "in-house" for an organization that may wish to train their employees on specific aspects of their job processes or responsibilities.  More formal relationships may further exist where corporate training is provided to employees through contracts or relationships with educational institutions who may award credit, either at the institution or through a system of [[Continuing education unit|CEUs]] (Continuing Education Units).

Many institutions or trainers offering corporate education will provide [[wikt:certificate|certificate]]s or [[diplomas]] verifying the attendance of the employee.  Some employers use corporate and continuing education as part of a holistic [[human resources]] effort to determine the performance of the employee and as part of their review systems.

Increasingly organisations appear to be using corporate education and training as an incentive to retain managers and key employees within their organisation. This [[win-win strategy|win-win arrangement]] creates better educated managers for the organisation and provides the employees with a more marketable portfolio of skills and, in many cases, recognised qualifications. 

==The Difference Between Corporate Education and Corporate Training==

Most organisations tend to think of corporate education as corporate training. Corporate training programs are often competency based and related to the essential training employees need to operate certain equipment or perform certain tasks in a competent, safe and effective manner. The outcome of a corporate training program is a participant who is either able to operate a piece of equipment or perform a specific task in an effective manner according to pre-determined training criteria. 

The primary role of corporate training is to ensure an employee has the knowledge and skills to undertake a specific operation to enable an organisation can continue to operate. Fundamentally, corporate training is centred on knowledge transfer, with an instructor teaching or demonstrating a particular function and the student learning and demonstrating they can apply what they have learnt to a particular operation.

Corporate education, however, adds another dimension and depth to training by involving learners as participants in generating new knowledge that assists an organisation to develop and evolve, rather than maintain the status quo. Corporate education focuses on developing the capability of an organisation to be able to do things and, in particular, the right things in order to be a sustainable and successful organisation.

Corporate education involves a facilitator, rather than an instructor or trainer, to engage participants and encourage them to think about the what, how and why of what they are doing and to challenge their current paradigms. Corporate education is centred on introducing learning techniques to stimulate employees to think about what their organisation does, where it is heading, potential new opportunities for the organisation and new and better ways of doing things. While the role of corporate training is to develop the operational competency of individuals, the purpose of corporate education is to promote the development of capability of both an individual and their organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, L: "Corporate Education: A Practical Guide to Effective Corporate Learning", p2-3. Griffin Press. 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-646-52812-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly organisations  appear to be using corporate education as an incentive to retain managers and key employees within their organisation. This win-win arrangement creates better educated managers and employees for the organisation and gives individual employees a more marketable portfolio of skills and, in many cases, recognised qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, C: "Strategic Change: the role of in-company management education".

{{Democracy}}
'''''Direct Action and Democracy Today''''' is a 2005 book by [[April Carter]].  In the book, Carter debates the nature and meaning of social and political protest and discusses the relationship between [[direct action]] and people's claims for greater [[democracy|democratic control]], not only against repressive regimes but also in [[liberal democracy|liberal parliamentary]] states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/id/Direct_Action_and_Democracy_Today/9780745629353 Direct Action and Democracy Today]  [[Polity Press]], {{ISBN|0-7456-2935-0}} (Hardback)&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter is clearly supportive of direct action, but her analysis is based on logic and evidence rather than advocacy. Her assessments suggest that theorists have not been paying enough attention to the challenge posed by direct action, a challenge to both systems of [[Power (sociology)|power]] and the ideas that legitimate them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/06BRjpr.html  A review] by [[Brian Martin (social scientist)|Brian Martin]] published in ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]'', volume 43, number 4, July 2006, p. 492.&lt;/ref&gt;

Healy''' is a professor of [[chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], and [[biochemistry]] at [[St. Edward's University]] in [[Austin, Texas]], where his research focuses on the design of structure-activity probes to elucidate enzymatic activity. Targets include [[HIV-1]] integrase, the [[c-Kit]] and src-[[ABL (gene)|abl]] proteins, and the [[metalloproteinases]] associated with  [[CXCL16]] shedding.  He was born in NewCastle West, Co. Limerick [[Ireland]] on September 25, 1958.  He received a doctorate in chemistry in 1984 from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] where he was a student of Dr. [[Michael J. S. Dewar]].  As a member of the Dewar research group he co-authored  [[Austin Model 1]], or AM1, a [[semi-empirical]] method for the quantum calculation of molecular electronic structure in [[computational chemistry]]. He appears in [[Richard Linklater]]'s 2001 film ''[[Waking Life]]'' explaining "telescopic" and [[technological evolution]].  Dr. Healy is married to [[Shelley Bueche]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9192">Developed by an independent team and published by UNESCO, the '''[http://en.unesco.org/gem-report/ EFA Global Monitoring Report]''' published from 2002-2015, aimed to sustain commitment towards '''[[Education for All]].''' It published 12 Reports from 2002 until 2015, and was then renamed, and relaunched under a new mandate as the Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report, UNESCO, whose principal role is to monitor progress towards the education targets in the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. It has been replaced by the Global Education Monitoring Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=About us |publisher=Global Education Monitoring Report  |accessdate=14 May 2017 |url=http://en.unesco.org/gem-report/about}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
In April 2000 more than 1,100 participants from 164 countries gathered in Dakar, Senegal, for the '''[[World Education Forum]]'''.

The participants, ranging from teachers to prime ministers, academics to policymakers, non-governmental bodies to the heads of major international organizations, adopted the 2000-word Dakar Framework for Action, Education for All: Meeting Our Collective Commitments

==About the EFA Global Monitoring Report==
The Education for All Global Monitoring Report was the prime instrument to assess progress towards achieving the six 'Dakar' EFA goals to which over 160 countries committed themselves in 2000. It tracked progress, identifies policy reforms and best practice in all areas relating to EFA, draws attention to emerging challenges and promotes international cooperation in favour of [[education]].

The publication was targeted at decision-makers at the national and international level, and more broadly, at all those engaged in promoting the right to quality education – teachers, civil society groups, NGOs, researchers and the international community.

Whilst the report had an annual agenda for reporting progress on each of the six EFA goals, each edition also adopted a theme, chosen because of its importance to the EFA process. As of 1 January 2016, the EFA Global Monitoring Report became the Global Education Monitoring Report (GEM Report), with a new mandate to monitor the new sustainable development goal on education (SDG 4). 
&lt;ref&gt;http://en.unesco.org/gem-report/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and audience==
The Education for All Global Monitoring Report aimed to inform education and aid policy through analysis of the challenges facing countries. While the prime audience consists of decision-makers such as ministers, policymakers, parliamentarians and education planners, other groups such as civil society, teachers, non-governmental organizations, university researchers and the media.are important.

==Data==
The '[[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]] (UIS), based in Montreal, played the leading role in providing data for the report on students, teachers, school performance, adult literacy and education expenditure.

The institute collects data from over 200 countries and territories, but serious limitations in data coverage make it difficult to monitor certain aspects of Education for All, from public financing to education. To improve and accelerate data collection, UIS is helping governments to strengthen their own systems and analysis capacities. The report also draws on data from national household surveys, specially commissioned studies and other sources.

The report published quality-assured data, compiled so that statistics are comparable for the majority of countries, using the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). Not all countries use the same classification systems, however, which lead to discrepancies between national data and those published internationally.

Differences also stemmed from national population estimates. To calculate several indicators, UIS uses estimates from the United Nations Population Division, which can differ from those published by individual countries. More generally, the quality assurance process entailed a time lag between the collection (and often the publication) of data by national governments and their release by UIS for use in this and other reports. Where possible, the report identified discrepancies and data gaps.

==Funding and organization==
The publication was funded in the majority by multilateral and bilateral agencies, and benefited from the expertise of an international Advisory Board. During its annual meeting, the Board discussed the scope and contents of the Report underway and provides advice on its future development.

Each Report was developed over a 12 to 18-month period. It drew on scholarship and expertise from governments, NGOs, bilateral and multilateral agencies, UNESCO institutes and research institutions. Research Papers commissioned for each Report are available on the website.

The final version of the Report was submitted to the Director-General of UNESCO on an annual basis and considered by the High-Level Group on Education for All, comprising 24 members, including government ministers, representatives of donor organizations, UN agencies and non-governmental organizations. Its role, as stated in the Dakar Framework for Action (paragraph 19), was to sustain and accelerate the political momentum created at the '''[[World Education Forum]]'''.

The Report is translated into the UN and other languages so that its messages and findings may be shared.

'''Education in [[Ivory Coast]]''' continues to face many challenges. The literacy rate for adults remains low: in 2000, it was estimated that only 48.7% of the total population was literate (60.8% of males and 38.6% of females).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many children between 6 and 10 years are not enrolled in school, mainly children of poor families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthtrends.wri.org/pdf_library/country_profiles/pop_cou_384.pdf |title=Earthtrends.wri.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511094511/http://earthtrends.wri.org/pdf_library/country_profiles/pop_cou_384.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of students in secondary education are male. At the end of secondary education, students can sit the Baccalauréat examination. The country has universities in Abidjan ([[Université de Cocody]]), Bouaké ([[Université de Bouaké]]), and Yamoussoukro (Institut national polytechnique [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]]).

==Education system==
The [[education]] system comprised three stages: [[primary school]] lasted six years, leading to a certificate of primary studies; [[secondary school]] lasted seven years, leading to a certificate or baccalauréat. [[University]] education, available only in [[Abidjan]], culminated in a university degree. A large number of technical and teacher-training institutions also provided post primary and post secondary education. There was no system of adult education, although many adults attended night courses or, in [[rural]] areas, received [[literacy]] and other instruction via [[radio]].

Most [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s were [[tuition]] free, although students pay an entrance fee and buy uniforms. Most supplies were free, and some students received government [[scholarship]]s, usually in return for a period of government [[employment]] after graduation.

In 1980 approximately 14 percent of primary schools and 29 percent of secondary schools were private. Most of these were [[Catholic]], staffed by religious and lay teachers, with salaries partially subsidized by government funding. Catholic schools operated primarily in the south and east but were also located throughout the country. Religious instruction was not permitted in government schools. Quranic schools were common in the north and were tolerated, but not supported, by the government. Some students attended both public and Quranic schools.

The school year was divided into three terms, beginning in September and separated by short [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]] holidays and a two-month summer [[Recess (break)|recess]]. The average week consisted of approximately 30 hours of classes, Monday through Saturday morning. Most instruction encouraged mental discipline more than analytical thinking or creativity, by emphasizing rote memorization and oral recitation.

===Primary education===

Approximately 9.5 million [[pupil]]s attended primary school in 1987, representing about 75% of boys and 50% of girls below age 15. Primary-school enrollments increased at a rate of about 7.2% per year from 1960 to 1980, climbing to 9.1% between 1976 and 1980. This rate slowed after 1980, averaging 4.2% from 1981 to 1984 and 2.2% in 1999.

In 2009, 79.6% of children attended secondary school. By 2012, this figure had risen to 94.2%, meaning that Côte d'Ivoire was on track to reach the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goal]] of primary education for all.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Children entered primary school at the age of seven or eight and passed through six grades, divided into preparatory, elementary, and intermediate levels. In the first six months, students mastered [[French language|French]], the language of instruction. Classes in [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], and [[arithmetic]] were taught, gradually supplemented by [[history]], [[geography]], [[natural sciences]], [[music]], [[art]], and [[physical education]]. Rural schools required students to work in school gardens and learn basic agricultural methods. Standard school-leaving exams led to the certificate of elementary education (certificat d'étude primaires élémentaires—CEPE) and determined entrance to secondary institutions.

===Secondary education===

About 250,000 students, or about 19 percent of primary-school graduates, attended government-funded secondary schools in 1987. Most of those preparing for university attended a collège or lycée, both of which included seven years of study divided into two cycles. Significant differences between these two institutions almost disappeared in the decades following their introduction by the French, but the lycée was generally administered by the national government and the collège by the municipal government with national funding.

After the first cycle or four years of secondary school, students took [[exam]]s and were awarded the certificate of the lower cycle of secondary study (brevet d'étude du premier cycle—BEPC). This qualification generally allowed them to continue at the collège or lycée, enter a teacher-training institution, or find an entry-level job in commerce or government. After the second cycle of three years of study, graduates earned the baccalauréat, which indicated a level of learning roughly equivalent to one or two years of university study in the [[United States]]. In [[Ivory Coast]], as in [[France]], it qualified a student for university entrance.

Secondary-school enrollments grew at a rate of about 11 percent per year from 1960 to 1984, but that rate has declined since 1984. The dropout rate was especially high for girls, who made up only 18 percent of the student body during the last two years of secondary school. An average of one-fourth of secondary students received the baccalauréat.

Complementary courses were the most common type of alternative secondary education, administered as four-year programs to improve the academic education of those who did not qualify for collège or lycée. Complementary courses were established during the 1950s, when expanding educational opportunities was a high priority. They were held throughout the country to compensate for the urban bias in secondary education. Complementary courses often provided a combination of academic and practical training, leading to an elementary certificate (brevet élémentaire—BE) or the BEPC, and enabled some students to enter the second cycle at a collège, lycée, or [[vocation]]al training institution.

Additional secondary-level courses were administered by religious organizations, most often the [[Catholic Church]]. These courses consisted of seven years of study divided into two cycles, with a certificate of completion awarded after each cycle. Teacher training was available, often as an alternative to academic university preparation, at a variety of postprimary levels. Secondary-level teacher training could lead to a BE certificate and admission to a normal school (école normale), which might be attended by students who left lycées or collèges after the first four years of study.

[[Vocation]]al training, attended by 47,000 students in 1982-83, was available at postprimary institutions. This training included courses in [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[public works]], [[transportation management]], secretarial and commercial subjects, and building trades. Graduates often worked as [[apprentice]]s or pursued further training at higher technical institutes.

In 2013, 39.08% of children attended secondary school.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

===Higher education===

==== Université de Côte d'Ivoire ====
The national Université de Côte d'Ivoire was founded in Abidjan in 1959 as the Center for Higher Education. It was renamed the Université d'Abidjan in 1964. In 1987, the university had a student roll of 18,732, including 3,200 women. Among students, about 10,000 were Ivoirian citizens. Heavily dependent on French assistance,the university had faculties of law, sciences, and letters and schools of agriculture, public works, administration and [[fine art]]s. Other institutions of higher learning, known as grandes écoles, awarded certificates of training in specialized fields in cooperation with, but not as part of, the national university. [[List of universities in Ivory Coast|Other universities]] have since been founded.

==== National tertiary enrolment ====
In 2012, there were 57,541 students enrolled at post-secondary diploma level, 23,008 students studying for a bachelor's or master's degree and 269 PhD students. Enrolment in tertiary education suffered during the political crisis, dropping from 9.03% to 4.46% of the 18-25-year cohort between 2009 and 2012. Whereas there were 156,772 students enrolled in higher education in 2007 (including post-secondary diplomas), this figure had halved to 80,818 by 2012. The drop was greatest among students enrolled in a bachelor's, master's or PhD degree, where numbers shrank from 95,944 in 2007 to just 23,277 in 2012.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=West Africa. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Essegbey|first=George|last2=Diaby|first2=Nouhou|last3=Konté|first3=Almamy|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=498–533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teachers===
In the mid-1980s, five classes of teachers were distinguished by their educational preparation and salary level: [[professor]]s, who taught at the secondary or university level; assistant professors at the secondary level; and instituteurs, instituteurs adjoint, and monitors at the primary level. Teachers' [[Salary|salaries]] were generally higher than salaries of civil servants with similar qualifications in the mid-1980s, although many people left teaching for more lucrative professions. The government responded to teacher shortages with training programs and short courses and by recruiting expatriates to teach at the secondary and postsecondary levels.

Teachers were organized into unions, most of them incorporated into the government-controlled central union federation ([[General Workers Union in Côte d'Ivoire]]—UGTCI). The National Union of Secondary School Teachers of Ivory Coast (SYNESCI) and two smaller unions remained outside the UGTCI and were outspoken in their criticism of government education policies and education finances in particular. Despite this tradition of criticism, many government officials achieved political office through leadership positions in the teachers' union.

==Trends in expenditure on education==

During the early 1980s, Ivory Coast spent a higher share of its [[gross national product]] and of its national budget on education than any other country in the world. Although this served as an indication of the nation's high regard for education, expatriate teachers' salaries accounted for a disproportionate share of expenditure, reducing the benefits to the nation. Generous scholarships for secondary school students reduced funds available for younger children.

In 2000, Ivory Coast devoted 3.7% of GDP to public education. By 2015, the government had increased this share to 5.03% of GDP, according to an estimation by the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]]. Higher education receives more than one-quarter of public education spending: 0.82% of GDP in 2000 and 1.08% of GDP in 2015.[http://data.uis.unesco.org/index.aspx?lang=en&amp;SubSessionId=4750d5fc-bd10-4acd-8a04-76149dea9329&amp;themetreeid=-200]

== Challenges in education ==
In the 1980s, the Ministry of National Education and Scientific Research assigned highest priority to problems of financing education development and reducing the number of school dropouts. Reducing regional inequities was also important; in 1986 enrollments in the south averaged about four times those in the north. The government employed innovative methods to improve the education system—including the use of [[Television|televised]] instruction in primary schools in the 1970s—a project that was abandoned as too expensive. [[Computer]]s and automated data processing equipment were used at the national university in 1987 and were to be introduced at lower levels of the education system by 1990. By the late 1980s, the government was producing its own text books, previously purchased in France, to reflect local cultural values.

The internal efficiency of the education system was relatively low, partly because of the large number of students who repeated courses and the high dropout level. The number of school-age children was expected to grow at an average annual rate of 4.3 percent by 1995, increasing the school-aged population by 50 percent. Unfortunately, teacher-training programs could not keep pace with these changes, and education planners were in particular demand. The link between education and [[employment]] was weak, exacerbated by the [[economic recession]] of the 1980s. Graduates, in effect, expected more than society could give them.

As in many countries, academic institutions and personnel often annoy government officials with their criticism of national policies. Mechanisms are used to co-opt or intimidate dissident leaders, although a few of their criticisms have been received favorably and have produced policy changes. Some outspoken teachers have been offered government jobs, in effect to receive the brunt of criticism they have generated.

Some students have been expelled from the university. The campus was closed down following antigovernment demonstrations in 1982, and campus organizations were banned. Secondary-school teachers who protested against the elimination of their housing benefits in 1983 found their professional organizations banned as well.

The '''Edyth May Sliffe Award''' is given annually to (roughly) 20 teachers in the United States by the [[Mathematical Association of America]] (MAA). The awards are funded by a bequest from a retired high school [[mathematics]] teacher named [[Edyth May Sliffe]], of [[Emeryville, California]]. Her purpose was to award high school teachers whose students have done well on the [[AHSME]], now the [[AMC 12]]. She felt students who won in math competitions received honors, but their teachers never received any recognition.

==Edyth May Sliffe and her Award==

(1901 - 1986)

[[Edyth May Sliffe]], a retired teacher who taught at [[Emery Secondary School|Emery High School]], felt that teachers also needed recognition for their contributions toward the students' success. In 1978 she contacted the Governor of the Northern California Section of the MAA, Professor Kenneth Rebman. Kenneth Rebman then told the President of the MAA, Professor Henry Alder, and arranged a meeting with Sliffe. She decided to use her estate to recognize 20 teachers of the highest scoring teams annually. Edyth Sliffe died on December 11, 1986. In accordance with her will, over $250,000 was donated to the MAA. Since 1989, about 20 high school teachers from the top 60 [[United States|American]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] schools have received the award annually. In 1995, the MAA Committee extended the award to middle school teachers. Five teachers are selected from each of the ten American Mathematics Competition Regions.

==Nomination of a Teacher==

Three students from each of the top 60 highest scoring teams in the [[AMC 12]] are asked to nominate a teacher they felt contributed most to their success.

==Award==

Award-winning teachers win a cash prize of $350-$750, a letter from the president of the MAA, a certificate signed by the president of MAA, Chair of the Committee on the [[AMC 12]], and the Executive Director of the [[American Mathematics Competitions]]. In addition, they get one year free membership in the MAA, and recognition in national and regional professional publications. The award ceremony is arranged by the school administrators. For middle school teachers, the award is $100.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2964">'''Energy Management''' (EM) is a business-specific degree, with a broad curriculum focusing on multiple facets of the energy industry: business (accounting, management, marketing, economics and MIS), geology, petroleum engineering, and law.  The [[American Association of Professional Landmen]] (AAPL) provides curriculum guidance and program support for approved petroleum land management programs.  Currently, the AAPL has 10 accredited universities in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="AAPL Approved Programs"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.landman.org/education/accredited-schools | title=AAPL, Approved PLM/EM Programs | publisher=American Association of Professional Landmen | accessdate=2015-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Oklahoma]] offered the first degree of this kind, emerging in 1958 as the Petroleum Land Management program before becoming the Energy Management program in 1999.&lt;ref name="OU EM website"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ou.edu/price/management_entrepreneurship/energy_management.html | title=University of Oklahoma, Energy Management website | publisher=University of Oklahoma | accessdate=2015-02-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224195730/http://www.ou.edu/price/management_entrepreneurship/energy_management.html | archivedate=2015-02-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Oklahoma program remains one of the top energy management programs in the United States.

Most students pursuing a degree in Energy Management enter the industry as [[Landman (oil worker)|landmen]], working with energy companies securing leases for drilling and mineral rights as well as contracting with property owners and energy brokers. It is also common for the landman to work alongside landmen from other companies to secure joint ventures in drilling. There are also career opportunities for EM students in commodities marketing and trading and in international negotiations.

The [[University of Tulsa]], [[Texas Tech University]], [[University of Calgary]], [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] and [[Western State Colorado University]] all offer similar AAPL approved degrees focusing on energy business education.&lt;ref name="AAPL Approved Programs"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.landman.org/education/accredited-schools | title=AAPL, Approved PLM/EM Programs | publisher=American Association of Professional Landmen | accessdate=2015-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre aims to combine culture with industry and offers young people the opportunity for creative growth and multicultural, multidisciplinary interchange. The centre is housed in a 17th-century villa near Villorba, restored and significantly enlarged by architect [[Tadao Ando]]. It was originally under the guidance of [[Godfrey Reggio]] and [[Oliviero Toscani]]. Previous directors include Laura Pollini and Dan Hill.

Young artists, designers, journalists and makers from around the world are invited to the centre and given a one-year scholarship, covering travel expenses, allowance and professional training and resources. Residents work in the areas of design, visual communication, photography, interaction, video, music and publishing under the guidance of Fabrica's core faculty, combining personal projects with work for clients.

Its first publication was ''Iranian Living Room,'' by 15 Iranian photographers, which was initially banned from being paid for through payments system [[PayPal]] for having the word "Iranian" in its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2374035/Fascinating-photos-shed-light-weird-wonderful-ways-Iranians-live-closed-doors.html|title=The human side to a pariah state: Fascinating pictures shed light on the weird and wonderful ways Iranians live behind closed doors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2013/09/30/iranian_living_room_a_photographic_tour_of_iran_s_domestic_interiors.html|title=What Does an Iranian Living Room Look Like?|date=30 September 2013|publisher=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/26/iranian-living-room_n_3654655.html|title=Photos: Everyday Life In Iran (New Book)|date=26 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/garden/a-blacklist-delays-book-on-iran.html|title=A Blacklist Delays Book on Iran|date=1 August 2013|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/03/rare-glimpse-private-life-iran/|title=A Rare Intimate Glimpse Into Private Lives in Iran|first=Doug|last=Bierend|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gating''' is a type of punishment similar to a [[Detention (Academia)|detention]] used typically at educational institutions, especially [[boarding schools]]. Precisely what a gating consists of and the rules surrounding it will vary between institutions, but the common element is that someone who has been gated is not permitted to leave the establishment. The word is used as both a noun and a verb.

'''Armed Forces Senior High Technical School''' is a secondary school located in [[Kumasi]], [[Ghana]].

==History==
The school's official name is '''Ghana Armed Forces Senior High Technical School'''. It was established on 28 January 1991 as part of one hundred and forty-six (146) Senior Secondary Schools which were opened throughout the country under the Education Reforms Programme which was started in 1987 with the Junior Secondary School. The school started with twenty three students made up of seventeen boys and six girls as pioneering students with six teachers. The current population is above 1800 students.

Initially, only technical and vocational programmes were offered in the school until January 1995, when Business studies was introduced into the school's curriculum. In January 1997, Secretariat and General Arts studies were also introduced. Since 2003, the school has introduced Elective Science and General Agricultural Studies in the curriculum. Consequently, the school offers all the programmes approved by the Ghana Education Service for the second cycle of the educational structure in [[Ghana]].

Though the school started off as a purely day institution, hostel facility was introduced for an initial group of 50 final year students on 19 September 1997 to cater for wards of service personnel and other and others who hailed from outside the Kumasi Metropolis. With effect from the 2006/2007 Academic Year, the Ghana Education Service granted approval for the school to operate as a Boarding/Day school.

==Location==
The School is located within the Old Uaddara Barracks, the former home of 4 Battalion of Infantry near the [[Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital]] in [[Kumasi]].

==Reception==
Science writer [[Brian Clegg (writer)|Brian Clegg]], author of ''Introducing Infinity'' (2012) in the same series, states that, "book works well as an introduction to the subject," and is, "a solid addition to the series though not an outstanding one." "The text flows nicely," and, Clegg continues, "isn't limited to the pure consideration of evolution by natural selection." "The images," which Clegg contends, "are always important in one of these books", "work well." Clegg concludes that this volume is superior the earlier ''[[Darwin for Beginners]]'', in the same series, as it, "covers the science better," and, "makes better use of the illustrated 'Introducing' format."&lt;ref name="PS01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Review - Introducing Evolution: A Graphic Guide|first=Brian|last=Clegg|url=http://www.popularscience.co.uk/reviews/rev633.htm|work=Popular Science|date=2011-04-16|accessdate=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tirocinio Formativo Attivo''' (''meaning Active - Formative - Traineeship'') or T.F.A. for short, is a post graduate course in order to be acknowledged as a public teacher of secondary education by the Italian state.

It was introduced by decree n. 249 of 10 September 2010, enacted by the law n. 244 of 24 December 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Art. comma 416 legge 24 dicembre 2007, n. 244&lt;/ref&gt; and further modified by [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy)|MIUR's (Ministry of Education)]] n. 81 of 25 March 2013, as to replace the old SISS (schools of specialization for secondary education teachers).
T.F.A. was, by the words of former Minister  [[Mariastella Gelmini]] under whose government T.F.A took their start, "the harshest and most professionalizing way to license teachers". In fact, as Gelmini stated, only 11.000 teachers made it to the end, in spite of 150.000 candidates attempting the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orizzontescuola.it/news/gelmini-docenti-tfa-rigidamente-selezionati-non-vanno-esclusi-assunzioni |title=Gelmini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly, TFA licensed teachers go by the name of  "tieffini".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orizzontescuola.it/news/tieffini-contrari-allipotesi-corso-concorso-ventilata-dal-governo-assunzione-ruolo |title=Tieffini contrari all'ipotesi corso-concorso ventilata dal Governo per assunzione in ruolo |website= Orizzonte Scuola}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2014/04/17/precari-voglio-fare-il-prof-no-tu-no-la-guerra-dei-tieffini/955116/ |title=Tfa, voglio fare il prof: no, tu no!}}&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal framework ==
Ministry decrete 249/2010 establishes traineeships to become secondary school teachers to be configured as " ''a two-years master degree plus a following year of T.F.A''." T.F.A. courses may be set up by any university department or by other high education institutions of artistic, musical, or choral subjects, under the condition of them being administrative headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;art. 10 DM 10 settembre 2010 n. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

As a matter of facts T.F.A is a one-year course to train teachers to be, held by universities, which confers, according to the result of the final exam, a teaching license among Italian public secondary school system.
T.F.A is started for each subject (or group) depending on the need of teachers.

== Access ==
Access to T.F.A courses, as a working competition, is strictly regulated by three exams, in order to prevent an excess of licensed teacher that would be unemployable.
Candidates must undergo and pass, in order:
* a preliminary exam, decided from the Ministry of Education, common for all the universities which have been entrusted to start the courses. It is made up of 60 multiple-choice question. Threshold score is set at 21/30. 
* a written exam, drawn up by each university. Threshold score is set at 21/30.
* a spoken exam, once more prepared by each university. Threshold score is set at 15/30.
After the testing phase, a ranking list of every candidate that made it through the selections is drafted. The final score is obtained by the sum of the marks recorded in each test. 
Candidates reaching the first positions of the ranking are granted access to the course within the limit of the vacancies stated by the Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]&lt;span contenteditable="false"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;[http://hubmiur.pubblica.istruzione.it/alfresco/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/88e73800-379f-476f-b14e-df9a5d7fa2c3/dm194_11.pdf Secondo quanto previsto dal D.M. MiUR dell'11 novembre 2011 n. 194.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obtaining the license ==
Article 10 of the Ministry decrete states:

"''By the end of the T.F.A., and after the successful completion of the final exam, candidates are acknowledged ''as ''licensed teacher for their respective subject of teaching".''

In her 2004 keynote address to the First Midwifery Symposium on "Updates in Midwifery", Dias suggested that upgrading the status of midwives would have a positive impact on the high rate of complications during delivery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/news/362866/karachi-raise-in-salary-of-midwives-stressed Dawn 28 June 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been an active participant in the School of Nursing and Midwifery’s Curriculum Committee and has twice served as Chair of the committee.

Her contribution has been immense in the standardization of professional nursing examinations, workshops and short courses, and faculty development programmes for curriculum enhancement, assessment and examinations. She has been convener of the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] and [[Pakistan Nursing Council]]’s Curriculum Committee, which led the team that produced the revised national curriculum for nursing. Dias has also worked with the Nursing Council on the National BScN curriculum, as well as assisting the Sindh Examination Board in meeting international standards.

Dias has been a member of the team that set up the BScN curriculum for [[Al-Baath University]] in Syria. She has also contributed  technical input into the nursing curriculum in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=aku /&gt;

Since 2010, Dias has been pioineering the application of e-learning methodology for the delivery of online courses and restructuring of pedagogical methods. In 2011, she initiated the establishment of the Assessment and Examination Cell for the School of Nursing and Midwifery. She has also done research in the evaluation of teaching in nursing education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042811007695 Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, Volume 15, 2011, Pages 2963–2966]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Aga Khan University School of Nursing and Midwifery introduced a ‘Care of the Elderly’ course, designed to provide training in geriatrics to nursing students for the first time in Pakistan. An important step for the growing older population. Dias, as the director of the BSc Nursing program, is responsible for the implementation of the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/598778/senior-citizens-countrys-elderly-population-in-need-of-care/ The Express Tribune, 3 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Dias held a joint appointment with Aga Khan University’s Department of Educational Development and the School of Nursing and Midwifery. She has had a profound impact on three decades of nursing students at the AKU.

In 2015, in connection with [[International Nurses Day|International Nurses and Midwives Day]], as the keynote speaker at [[Ziauddin University| Ziauddin College of Nursing]] Dias pointed out the importance of adopting more modern approaches to recruitment, especially the need to provide opportunities for those who had received a diploma before the introduction of the standard curriculum in 2006. She pointed out that at 1:3, the ratio of nurses to doctors in Pakistan needed to be reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/885314/international-nurses-and-midwives-day-only-one-nurse-for-every-2500-patients-in-pakistan/|title=International Nurses and Midwives Day: ‘Only one nurse for every 2,500 patients in Pakistan’|publisher=''Express Tribune, Pakistan''|accessdate=12 May 2015 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11372">'''Katharine "Kay" Bullitt''' (born February, 22, 1925) is a [[Seattle]] education reformer, civil rights activist and philanthropist. Bullitt was instrumental in the [[desegregation]] of [[Seattle Public Schools|Seattle public schools]].

== Early years ==
Katharine "Kay" Bullitt was born in 1925 in Boston and was raised in Arlington, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/bullitt.htm|title=Kay Bullitt|website=depts.washington.edu|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother had a long career as dean of women at Colorado College before marrying in her late 30's and having three daughters. Kay was the middle child between Marion ("Barney") and Margaret ("Margie").&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parentmap.com/article/2014-superheroes-for-washington-families?page=2|title=2014 Superheroes for Washington Families - ParentMap|website=www.parentmap.com|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullitt attended the [[Shady Hill School]] in Cambridge.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title="I thought if I'd stayed in Cambridge ... I'd have been active in teaching and Democratic politics"|date=1969-12-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhOvhAdbvgU&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un&amp;index=2|accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullitt's interest in civic projects began early and focused on education and peace. She attended [[Radcliffe College]] which both her mother and sister had attended.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title=Kay Bullitt: Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project (Segment 1)|date=2016-11-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bXmKE0b0Yo&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un&amp;index=1|accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in college, Bullitt worked in a community center in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] which primarily serviced African-American children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Kay's sister had written her thesis on the difference between African-American students from [[Barbados]] and the South.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Kay's own senior thesis was on the role of Federal Government in Education.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  During World War II, Bullitt spent a summer at the Hampton Institute in Virginia as part of an interracial farm project. Bullitt was also active with the Massachusetts Fair Employment Practice.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After the end of World War II, Bullitt worked in Germany for two summers.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title=Bullitt describes her role in several efforts to desegregate Seattle public schools in the 1960s|date=2016-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WdYGdet0uU&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un|accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After college, Bullitt taught at the Shady Hill School in Cambridge which she had attended as a child.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She taught the fourth grade there for five years. Inspired by the ability that she had observed in the young African-Americans she had worked with, Bullitt decided to take a trip across the country to observe what education and work experience was like for children. In her wanderings, Bullitt came to Seattle and decided to stay in 1951.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Desegregation in Seattle ==
In the 1960s, Bullitt hosted an integrated day camp at her home on Capitol Hill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title="It showed all during that time when there was such difficulty in the schools..."|date=2016-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DK8NBm6E54&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un|accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Bullitt said that the camp was "self-serving," as she had three older (step-)children and three under six, all with different interests.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; She recruited teachers and counselors from the [[League of Women Voters]] and The Little School in Seattle. From after the World's Fair in 1962 through the early seventies, the camp was integrated and grew to host 100 children and 35 teenagers running it.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Also during this time in the 1960s, Bullitt began work in Seattle to integrate schools through voluntary transfer.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Her children were going to [[Lowell Elementary School (Seattle, Washington)|Lowell Elementary School]] in the Capitol Hill neighborhood and they began a partnership with Madrona School, a primarily African-American school in Seattle, and had about 50 children going between the schools. Bullitt also started the Voluntary Instruction Program (VIP) which brought in volunteers to teach subjects in small groups, starting with Madrona, but then went to other Central District schools.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The program disappeared when they were unable to convince the district to fund a directorship position.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Bullitt briefly headed a program called School Affiliation Service which was based on her visits to Germany after World War II. Bullitt wanted to have people come from the South to see how the integration in Seattle was working.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This program eventually evolved into  the Coalition for Quality Integrated Education (CQIE) in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/school-integration-memories-hit-home/|title=School-Integration memories hit home|date=2012-06-13|newspaper=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title=In the early 1970s Bullitt started a volunteer organization to work for school desegregation|date=2016-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hup_BX8_kus&amp;index=6&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un|accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wawona and Other Civic Projects ==
In 1963 after reading an article in the local paper about the ''[[Wawona (schooner)|Wawona]]'', an historic schooner, Bullitt began efforts to save and restore the ship.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/historic-schooner-wawona-heads-for-demise/|title=Historic schooner Wawona heads for demise|date=2009-03-05|newspaper=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 165 foot-long ship was launched in 1897 and was initially used to haul lumber up and down the Pacific Coast.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The schooner also served as a fishing schooner in the Bering Sea and was a military barge during Word War II.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After 46 years and numerous fundraising and volunteer efforts, it was determined it would be too costly to restore and they were unable to secure permanent moorage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ship, which was profiled in ''Shipbuilders, Sea Captains and Fishermen'' by Joe Follansbee, was dismantled in 2009, with portions being saved for the Seattle Museum of History &amp; Industry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bullitt was instrumental in founding several Civic and community projects in Seattle. She helped found [[Bumbershoot]], an annual international music and arts festival in Seattle, which takes place every Labor Day Weekend at the [[Seattle Center]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/kay-bullitt/|title=Kay Bullitt|date=2005-08-26|newspaper=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the seventies, Bullitt helped found a savings and loan bank for women, called Sound Savings &amp; Loan. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title="We were able to help a lot of women get credit and get loans, and the banks started hiring women"|date=2016-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4l3Ita5MNA&amp;index=9&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un|accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullitt helped restore Pioneer Square.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1982 Bullitt, then a director of the Municipal League, helped organize Target Seattle, which was a week-long [[symposium]] on the dangers of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/3123|title=Target Seattle symposium discusses nuclear war and doomsday for a week beginning on September 24, 1982. - HistoryLink.org|website=www.historylink.org|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title=In the 1980s, Bullitt helped organize a weeklong anti-nuclear protest in Seattle|date=2016-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv0qucXK0G8&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un&amp;index=11|accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers included [[Louis Harris]], [[David Brower]], [[Jonas Salk|Dr. Jonas Salk]], Dr. [[John E. Mack]], [[Richard Wall Lyman]], and [[Archibald Cox]].The event finished with a speech by Cox at the Seattle [[Kingdome]] and with an attendance of 10,000- 20,000 people.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Every year for 60 years, on Wednesday evenings in July, Bullitt hosted a picnic for family and friends at her Capitol Hill home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Bullitt also hosted Seattle's Middle East Peace Camp for Children for a number of years on the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2007/08/18/peace-camp-stresses-unity-diversity|title=Peace Camp Stresses Unity in Diversity|last=|first=|date=|work=Common Dreams|access-date=2017-03-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title="As {{sic|hide=y|Ghandi}} said, 'If you want real peace, start with the children.'"|date=2016-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvDhtLaq0no&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un&amp;index=12|accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullitt, with her former late husband, Stimson Bullitt, donated the property to the city to be a park after her death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Democracy Workshop|title=Steinbrueck Kickoff - Kay Bullitt - 05-05-2013|date=2013-05-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mRbtUMp4yI|accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullitt has many awards including a United Nations Human Rights Prize.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Personal ==

Stimson Bullitt was the President of KING Broadcasting in Seattle from 1962-72. He was also an attorney, author, judge and outdoorsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/civic-leader-charles-stimson-bullitt-ran-king-tv-and-helped-shape-seattle/|title=Civic leader Stimson Bullitt ran KING-TV and helped shape Seattle|date=2009-04-21|newspaper=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic slurs==
*'''[[Cracker (pejorative)|Cracker]]''': The use of "cracker" as a pejorative term for a white person does not come from the use of [[bullwhip]]s by whites against slaves in the [[Atlantic slave trade]].  The term comes from the labor of cracking corn (as referred to in the song [[Jimmy Crack Corn]]) and was used as a pejorative term for a southern sharecropper who grew and milled corn for a living.  The cracked corn – or nib – was the hard bit of the kernel discarded from milled corn.  The nib was considered undesirable and the sharecropper would take this as his share and feed his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cracker|title=Cracker (2)|year=2010|publisher=|author=Douglas Harper|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Gringo]]''': The word "gringo" (a pejorative term for a white American) did not originate during the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–1848), the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]] (1811–1823), the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–1920), or in the [[American Old West]] ({{circa}} 1865–1899) as a corruption of the lyrics "green grow" in either "[[Green Grow the Lilacs]]" or "[[Green Grow the Rushes, O]]" sung by [[United States Army|American soldiers]] or [[cowboy]]s; nor did it originate during any of these times as a corruption of "Green go home!", falsely said to have been shouted at green-clad American troops, or of "green coats" as a description of their uniforms. The word originally simply meant "foreigner" and is probably a corruption of Spanish ''griego'', "Greek".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

*'''[[Niggardly]]''': The word "niggardly", meaning stingy or miserly, is not actually related to the racial slur "[[nigger]]", despite the similar sound. Like "niggle", it may derive from Old Norse ''nigla'', meaning "to fuss about small matters";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/niggle|title=niggle - Origin and meaning of niggle by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively, it may derive from another Germanic root meaning "exact" or "careful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/niggard|title=niggard - Origin and meaning of niggard by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, "nigger", like "Negro", traces back to Latin ''niger'', meaning "black".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/nigger|title=nigger - Origin and meaning of nigger by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word, originally spelled "spig", was short for "spiggoty", which is probably from the [[Spanglish]] phrase "No speak the English".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

==Acronyms==
The use of acronyms to create new words was nearly non-existent in English until the middle of the 20th century. Nearly all older words were formed in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;Keith M. Denning ''et al.'', ''English Vocabulary Elements'', 2007 {{isbn|0198037538}}, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Coma]]''': Some falsely believe that the word coma originates from "cessation of motor activity". Although this describes the condition of coma, this is not the true derivation. The word is actually derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kōma'', meaning ''deep sleep''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/coma?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins Dictionary|title=Coma Definition|date=n.d.|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''News''': The word news has been claimed to be an acronym of the four [[cardinal directions]] (north, east, west, and south). However, old spellings of the word varied widely (e.g., newesse, newis, nevis, neus, newys, niewes, newis, nues, etc.). Additionally, an identical term exists in French, "les nouvelles", which translates as the plural of "the new". The word "news" is simply a plural form of ''new''.
* '''Pom''' or '''pommy''' is an [[Australian English]], [[New Zealand English]], and [[South African English]] term for a person of British descent or origin. The exact origins of the term remain obscure ([[Alternative words for British#Pommy|see here for further information]]). A legend persists that the term arises from the acronym P.O.M.E., for "prisoner of Mother England" (or P.O.H.M, "prisoners of His/Her Majesty"), although there is no evidence to support this assertion.
* '''Posh''' was not an acronym for wealthy British passengers getting "port out, starboard home" cabins on ocean liners to India, in order to get ocean breeze. The actual origins of the word are unknown.
* ''Shit:'' see under "Obscenities"

*'''[[Whole nine yards|Whole Nine Yards]]''': The actual origin of the phrase "The whole nine yards" is a complete mystery, and nearly all claimed explanations are easily proven false. Incorrect explanations include the length of machine gun belts, the capacity of concrete mixers (in cubic yards), various types of fabric, and many other explanations. All are probably false, since most rely on nine yards when evidence suggests that the phrase began as "the whole six yards". In addition, the phrase has appeared in print as early as 1907, while many explanations require a much later origin date.

* "'''[[Adamant]]'''": often believed to come from Latin ''adamare'', meaning to love to excess. In fact derived from Greek [[Wikt:ἀδάμας|ἀδάμας]], meaning indomitable. There was a further confusion about whether the substance referred to is [[diamond]] or [[lodestone]].
* '''Buck''': The use of "buck" to mean "[[dollar]]" did not originate from a practice of referring to [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] as "bucks" (male deer) when trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/offense/buck.asp|title=Passing the Buck|date=July 12, 2007|publisher=Urban Legends Reference Pages|author=|work=[[Snopes.com]]|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Buck" was originally short for "[[buckskin (leather)|buckskin]]", as buckskins were used in trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2001|title=Buck|encyclopedia=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Emoji]]''': These pictographic characters are often mistakenly believed to be a simplified form of the word [[emoticon]], itself a portmanteau of "emotional icon".{{cn|date=October 2018}} However, ''emoji'' is a Japanese term composed from "e" (image) and "moji" (character).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/emoji|title=emoji (n.)|website=https://www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Faggot (slang)|Faggot]]''': The slur usage of the word "faggot" (originally referring to a bundle of firewood) is sometimes falsely claimed to come from a practice of throwing homosexuals into a fire to be burned to death, as they were not important enough to be burned at the stake.  One possible origin is in the use of "faggot" as a pejorative term for women in a similar way to "baggage", i.e. something heavy to be dealt with.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}  The usage may also have been influenced by the British term "[[Fagging|fag]]", meaning a younger schoolboy who acts as an older schoolboy's servant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/faggot|title=faggot - Origin and meaning of faggot by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Hiccough''', an alternate spelling still encountered for [[hiccup]], originates in an assumption that the second syllable was originally ''cough''. The word is in fact [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] in origin.
*'''[[Idiot]]''' does come from the ancient Greek word ''ἰδιώτης'' (idiōtēs, "a private person, individual"), but it was not derogatory in Greek, and did not express the notion that it was foolish ("idiotic") not to participate in civic life. Indeed, a citizen (''πολίτης'') was an ''ἰδιώτης'' when acting in a private rather than an official capacity, even in deliberations of the Assembly. The meaning "foolish" or "stupid" came much later.&lt;ref&gt;A.W. Sparkes, "Idiots, Ancient and Modern", ''Australian Journal of Political Science'' '''23''':1:101-102 (1988) {{doi|10.1080/00323268808402051}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Innocence|'''Innocent''']]": often wrongly believed to have the original meaning of "not knowing", as if it came from Latin ''noscere'' (to know); in fact it comes from ''nocere'' (to harm), so the primary sense is "harmless".

Icelandic ''ey'' "island").  The spelling ''island'' with an S, however, is indeed due to the influence of ''isle''.
* "'''[[Marmalade]]'''": there is an apocryphal story that [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], ate it when she had a headache, and that the name is derived from her maids' whisper of "Marie est malade" (Mary is ill). In fact it is derived from Portuguese ''marmelo'', meaning [[quince]], and then expanded from quince jam to other fruit preserves.  It is found in English-language sources written before Mary was even born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-mar3.htm|title=World Wide Words: Marmalade|website=World Wide Words|language=en-gb|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nasty''': The term ''nasty'' was not derived from the surname of [[Thomas Nast]] as a reference to his biting, vitriolic cartoons. The word may be related to the Dutch word ''nestig'', or "dirty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/blgermyth03.htm|title=German Myth 3 – Thomas Nast and the word 'nasty'|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It predates Nast by several centuries, appearing in the most famous sentence of [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]], that in the state of nature, the life of man is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short". That work was published in 1651, whereas Nast was born in 1840.

In fact, "till" is the older word; "until" is a compound of "till" and the Old Norse prefix "und-" ("up to", "as far as""&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED2|until|page=234|volume=XIX}}&lt;/ref&gt;), just as "unto" is a compound of that prefix and "to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/until|title=until - Origin and meaning of until by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "'''Woman'''" did not originate from "woven from man", nor did it originate from the word "womb". It came from the Old English ''wifmann'' ("woman person"), a compound of ''wif'' ("woman" – cf. "wife") + ''man'' ("human being"). ''Mann'', the word for "person", eventually came to be used for males specifically.
* "'''[[Welsh rarebit]]'''" has been claimed to be the original spelling of the savoury dish "Welsh rabbit". Both forms now have currency, though the form with "rabbit" is in fact the original.  Furthermore, the word "Welsh" in this context was used in a pejorative sense, meaning "foreign" or "substandard", and does not indicate that the dish originated in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magic Music Days''' is a program put on by the [[Disneyland Resort]], the [[Walt Disney World Resort]], the [[Disneyland Resort Paris]] and the [[Hong Kong Disneyland Resort]].  It brings in school and community groups to perform in the parks and/or take part in workshops or clinics. Types of groups include:
* Instrumental Groups
* Vocal Groups
* Dance Groups

== Performance Requirements ==
[[Disneyland]]: Groups wishing to perform must send in a video of the group and pass an audition. Groups that do not pass may not perform in the park but may participate in a workshop.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Walt Disney World]]: Groups wishing to perform must send in a video audition and picture with their application. All groups must purchase tickets through Disney Magic Music Days.  They may perform in the parks or participate in a workshop. Groups that do not pass may not perform in the park but may participate in the workshop. &lt;br /&gt;
[[Hong Kong Disneyland]]: Groups must send in a video, picture and proposed song list with their application. All groups must purchase tickets through Disney Magic Music Days.

== Performance Areas ==
[[Image:Magic Music Days Stage.jpg|thumb|Located on the west side of Epcot, this stage is used primarily by vocal and instrumental groups participating in the Disney's Magic Music Days program.]]
[[Disneyland]]: Dance and Instrumental groups may perform at the Carnation Plaza Gardens stage located to the west of Sleeping Beauty Castle or at the Hollywood Backlot stage in Disney's California Adventure (DCA).  On rare occasions the Small World mall area has been used for performances.  Bands march down Disneyland's parade route as a pre-parade, a show directly before the parade.  Bands might also march down DCA's performance corridor as a pre-parade or as a pre-show to the High School Musical Pep Rally.

[[Walt Disney World]]: Orchestras may play on an outdoor stage at the marketplace, an outdoor shopping center.  At [[Epcot]], groups may also perform on a stage that is encased by a temporary "shell", this is located next to Innoventions West.  The stage faces a small seating area with a control booth at the rear of the area. [[Magic Kingdom]]: Groups performing in the Magic Kingdom may have the opportunity to perform Cosmic Ray's Starlite Cafe in [[Tomorrowland]]. Groups may also perform at the [[Disney Springs]] stage in front of [[World of Disney]]. For those groups that are marching, the bands perform a march down the parade route at various times but may or may not coincide with one of Disney's actual parades. They may also march at Epcot around the World Showcase or Future World.

[[Hong Kong Disneyland]]: Vocal and dance groups may perform at the Hong Kong Disneyland Railroad station located in Main Street, U.S.A. inside the park. March bands may march down Main Street, U.S.A. starting from the first-aid station. Orchestras may play on the castle forecourt in front of [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]]. During Christmastime, groups may also perform in the front lobby of [[Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel]] and [[Disney's Hollywood Hotel]].

== Workshops/Clinics ==
[[Disneyland]]: Disneyland workshops are run by current and former Disneyland Cast Members who work professionally outside of Disneyland in the industry of the workshop they are running. Instrumental clinicians often conduct, arrange, direct, or perform music for major television and movie studios.  Workshops are 90 minutes long and are designed to give students a taste of what professional studio musicians, singers, or dancers go through.  Dance workshops are run like an audition. Instrumental workshops and Choral workshops cover multiple song segments from Disney animated and live action movies and are dubbed onto the film using a click track. Groups participating in a Workshop often receive a DVD of their work.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Walt Disney World]]: WDW clinics are run by Disney World Cast Members. Some of these clinicians also work professionally in their field outside of Walt Disney World.  Instrumental clinics are three hours long, cover one Disney medley piece, played back with Disney animation clips, much like a movie trailer.  A Disney character, usually Mickey or Goofy, makes an appearance at the end of the workshop to thank the students for their work. Groups participating in a Workshop receive a DVD of their work.

== Souvenirs ==
[[Disneyland]]: Directors receive any signs displayed in Disneyland or Disney's California Adventure which displayed their group's name, a plaque thanking the group for its efforts in arts, and a gift bag courtesy of the Yamaha corporation. Each participant receives a Disneyland specific Magic Music Days shirt.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Walt Disney World]]: For the groups that perform in the Magic Music Days program, the participants might receive a couple souvenirs from Disney. Past items include a commemorative pin from the Magic Music Days (this pin is exclusively reserved for just the participants) and a shirt with the Magic Music Days logo on the front.  The director/organization receive a banner indicating their groups performance for the "World", a plaque that they can display, or a small statue of Mickey Mouse all dressed up as a director.

==Backstage==
Groups participating in the program are taken through backstage areas of the parks that guests normally cannot see. (Photography and videography are prohibited in these areas.) The group may have their picture taken by Disney and then either perform, take part in a workshop, or experience both.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Disneyland]]: Participants enter backstage via access roads along the north side of the park, using changing rooms and the four-room rehearsal hall near the backside of Toontown.  They can also catch glimpses of various warehouses and the adjacent Circle D Ranch where Disneyland's livestock are kept.  During this time, they can purchase drinks or snacks through vending machines. &lt;br /&gt;
[[Epcot]]: A Magic Music Days building is located behind the Italian pavilion. There, groups may change into their costumes/gowns, warm up, have rehearsals, or anything else the group may need to perform prior to appearing onstage. The groups may enter the park in two locations, one being located next to Italy, and the other between Imagination! and The Land Pavilions.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Magic Kingdom]]: Students performing in the Magic Kingdom are escorted through a cast-members-only entrance next to Pirates of the Caribbean. From there, they make their way to changing locations to prepare for their performance.

==Famous Performers==
*[[The Idlers]] - yearly since 1988 (Epcot: World Showcase stage/American Adventure pavilion; Magic Kingdom: various venues)

==Sponsorship==

'''The Open University of Israel''' ({{lang-he-n|האוניברסיטה הפתוחה}}, ''Ha-Universita ha-Ptuha'') is a [[distance education|distance-education]] [[university]] in [[Israel]].  Its administration center is located in the city of [[Ra'anana]]. {{As of|2006}}, the Open University had taught around 39,000 students.

The university has more students than any other academic institution in Israel, coming from all over the world. The university is accredited to award [[undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] degrees, diplomas and certificates.

==History==
[[File:Library of Open University of Israel.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Library of Open University of Israel]]
[[File:בניין מרכז לטכנולוגיה חינוכית 2.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Building of the Educational Technology Center]]
[[File:Open University of Israel campus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Campus of the Open University of Israel]]
[[File:בניין האוניברסיטה הפתוחה מקדימה3.JPG|thumb|250px|The Rennert Study Center]]
The Open University of Israel was conceived in 1971 and founded in 1974, modeled after the UK's [[Open University]]. The first semester of studies commenced on October 17, 1976. In 1980, the Open University was officially recognized as an institute of higher learning in Israel, and was accredited to award undergraduate or bachelor's degrees (BA). In 1982, 41 graduates were awarded BA diplomas at the university's first diploma ceremony.

By 1987, the university had 11,000 students and offered 180 courses. The university grew rapidly and by 1993, it had 20,000 students and 300 courses, and 405 new graduates. Then, in 1996, the university launched its postgraduate program offering courses towards a master's degree (MA). By 2002, the university had grown to 36,710 enrolled students and by 2003, more than 13,000 people had graduated the university with an academic degree.

In 2010, the Open University began offering online courses taught in Russian. Students could enroll worldwide for 24 courses, most of them with Israeli or Jewish content. According to the online program, examinations can be held at Israeli consulates and [[Jewish Agency]] offices around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dattel |first=Lior |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/open-university-pioneering-courses-for-overseas-russians-by-internet-1.310269 |title=Open University pioneering courses for overseas Russians, by Internet |publisher=Haaretz |date=April 2, 2008 |accessdate=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Undergraduate studies==
The Open University is open to anyone who wishes to study towards a [[bachelor's degree]], without any prerequisites or screening process. However, the Open University still has high standards and demands academic achievements from its graduates. Another way in which the Open University is ''open'' is in the study path it offers to its students. When enrolling in the university, the student does not need to decide the primary focus of his or her degree, nor to determine in advance the pace of the degree (how many years the studies will take). In fact, it is possible to take only a single course or several courses without receiving a degree, or to take several courses per semester, until finally enough courses relevant to a certain academic area have been taken to be eligible for a degree.

To achieve these goals, the Open University employs distance education. The university has no single central campus, or rigid schedules, making it especially well-suited to those who are preoccupied with a job, army service, or their family.

The most important aspect of studying in the Open University is self-study from books. Each of the university's courses has a specially-prepared book with the course material and exercises, from which the students study on their own. The Open University's books and teaching aids have become quite popular in Israel's other universities and colleges as well.

To supplement the self-study, there are occasional group meetings, where the students can ask the teacher questions about the material, and talk to other students who take the same course. These meetings take place throughout Israel, and are optional to attend. The students can also use the university's Internet site ("TELEM") to communicate with the teachers or with other students. Some courses also feature video cassettes, multimedia CDs, and other audio-visual aids. Recently, video-conferencing technology has also enabled viewing a real-time lecture without the students all coming to a single campus. For each course, students must complete several required assignments, and take a final exam. To obtain a degree, students must participate in one or more seminar courses, depending on the academic program. The examination of seminar papers is carried out by academic staff members of [[List of universities and colleges in Israel|Israel's universities]].

==Graduate studies==
The Open University also has [[master's degree]] programs for some of the areas it teaches, but they are not open to everyone and do have acceptance criteria. At present, the university does not offer [[Doctorate|doctoral]] programs.

==Affiliation with other universities==
The Open University, together with the other Israeli universities, has reached agreements that enable students to begin their undergraduate studies within the flexible framework of the Open University and after taking a cluster of courses, decide whether they would like to complete their degree at the Open University, or transfer to another institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-e.openu.ac.il/academic/234.html |title=Requirements for all Bachelor's degrees |publisher=E.openu.ac.il |date= |accessdate=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courses studied at the Open University will shorten the duration of degree studies at the other academic institution.

Since 2007, the transfer options are available to:
*[[Tel Aviv University]]: Faculty of Humanities; Faculty of Social Sciences (School of Economics); Faculty of Engineering
*[[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]: Faculty of Social Sciences (Department of Economics, Department of Sociology and Anthropology); Faculty of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Quality Sciences in Rehovot; Computer Science Department.
*[[University of Haifa]]: Faculty of Humanities; Faculty of Social Sciences (Department of Economics)
*[[Ben Gurion University of the Negev]]: The Faculty of Engineering Sciences (Computer Science); The Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences (Department of Eco

'''Peter Albert David Singer''', [[Order of Australia|AC]] (born 6 July 1946) is an Australian moral philosopher. He is the Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at [[Princeton University]], and a Laureate Professor at the [[Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics]] at the [[University of Melbourne]]. He specialises in [[applied ethics]] and approaches ethical issues from a [[Secularity|secular]], [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] perspective. He is known in particular for his book ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975), in which he argues in favour of [[vegetarianism]], and his essay "[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality]]", in which he argues in favour of donating to help the global poor. For most of his career, he was a [[preference utilitarianism|preference utilitarian]], but he announced in ''The Point of View of the Universe'' (2014), coauthored with [[Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek]], that he had become a [[Utilitarianism#Higher and lower pleasures|hedonistic utilitarian]].

On two occasions, Singer served as chair of the philosophy department at [[Monash University]], where he founded its [[Centre for Human Bioethics]]. In 1996 he stood unsuccessfully as a [[Australian Greens|Greens]] candidate for the [[Australian Senate]]. In 2004 Singer was recognised as the Australian Humanist of the Year by the [[Council of Australian Humanist Societies]]. In 2005, the [[Sydney Morning Herald]] placed Singer among [[Australia|Australia's]] ten most influential public intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Visontay |first1=Michael |title=Australia's top 100 public intellectuals |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/australias-top-100-public-intellectuals-20050312-gdkwox.html |access-date=27 October 2018 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=12 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer is a cofounder of [[Animals Australia]] and the founder of [http://thelifeyoucansave.org The Life You Can Save].

==Early Life, Education and Career==
[[File:Singer1.jpg|thumb|right|Singer in 2009]]
Singer's parents were [[History of the Jews in Austria|Austrian Jews]] who immigrated to Australia from [[Vienna]] in 1938, after [[Anschluss|Austria's annexation]] by [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="talkingheads"&gt;{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Peter |title=Talking Heads – Peter Singer |url=http://www.abc.net.au/talkingheads/txt/s1932378.htm |date=28 May 2007 |access-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525095518/http://www.abc.net.au/talkingheads/txt/s1932378.htm |archive-date=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They settled in [[Melbourne]], where Singer was born. Singer's father imported tea and coffee, while his mother practiced medicine. He has an older sister, Joan (now Joan Dwyer).  His grandparents were less fortunate: his paternal grandparents were taken by the Nazis to [[Ghetto Litzmannstadt|Łódź]], and were never heard from again; his maternal grandfather [[David Ernst Oppenheim]] (1881–1943), a teacher, died in the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Aiton |first=Douglas |title=Ten Things You Didn't Know about Professor Peter Singer |magazine=The Weekend Australian |date=27 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oppenheim was a member of the [[Vienna Psychoanalytic Society]] and he wrote a joint article with [[Sigmund Freud]], before joining the [[Alfred Adler|Adlerian]] sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mühlleitner |first=Elke |title=Biographisches Lexikon der Psychoanalyse: Die Mitglieder der Psychologischen Mittwoch-Gesellschaft und der Wiener Psychoanalytischen Vereinigung 1902–1938 |location=Tübingen |year=1992 |publisher=Edition Diskord |pages=239–240 |isbn=3-89295-557-3 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer later wrote a biography on Oppenheim.&lt;ref name="Pushing"&gt;{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |title=Pushing Time Away: My Grandfather and the Tragedy of Jewish Vienna |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Pushing_Time_Away.html?id=G4T5Ua0ABt8C |year=2007 |access-date=27 October 2018 |publisher=Fourth Estate |isbn=0-7322-7742-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer is an [[Atheism|atheist]], and was raised in a prosperous, happy, non-religious family.  His family rarely observed Jewish holidays, and Singer declined to have a [[Bar Mitzvah]].&lt;ref name="Indep1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Specter |first=Michael |title=ETHICS MAN |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/ethics-man-1127735.html |access-date=27 October 2018 |work=The Independent |date=21 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Singer attended [[Preshil]]&lt;ref&gt;Suzannah Pearce, ed.

After leaving school, Singer studied [[law]], [[history]], and [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Melbourne]], gaining his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree ([[hons]]) in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/15/peter-singer-profile |last=Vulliamy |first=Ed |date=15 February 2009 |access-date=27 October 2018 |title=Peter Singer |location=London |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has explained that he elected to major in philosophy after his interest was piqued by discussions with his sister's then-boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8djTnJvcATU&amp;t=5m28s |title=Peter Singer talk, "My Life in Philosophy: The Point of View of the Universe and Its Implications for Ethics, Animal Liberation and Effective Altruism |publisher=Universität Graz |location=Graz, Austria |date=7 June 2017 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] degree for a thesis entitled "Why should I be moral?" at the same university in 1969. He was awarded a scholarship to study at the [[University of Oxford]], and obtained from there a [[Bachelor of Philosophy|BPhil]] degree in 1971, with a thesis on civil disobedience supervised by [[R. M. Hare]] and published as a book in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Singer |title=Democracy and Disobedience |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1973 |isbn=0-19-824504-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer names Hare and Australian philosopher H.

He was having a discussion after class with fellow graduate student Richard Keshen, a Canadian, over lunch.  Keshen opted to have a salad after being told that the spaghetti sauce contained meat.  Singer had the spaghetti.  Singer eventually questioned Keshen about his reason for avoiding meat. Keshen explained his ethical objections.  Singer would later state, "I'd never met a vegetarian who gave such a straightforward answer that I could understand and relate to."  Keshen later introduced Singer to his vegetarian friends. Singer was able to find one book in which he could read up on the issue (''Animal Machines'' by [[Ruth Harrison]]) and "within a week or two" he approached his wife saying that he thought they needed to make a change to their diet, and that he didn't think they could justify eating meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3kyfLjyBzo&amp;t=46s |title=The Ethics of Food: The Making of a Vegetarian and Professor of Bioethics - Peter Singer |access-date=27 October 2018 |date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8djTnJvcATU&amp;t=20m48s |title=Peter Singer: Eine bessere Welt für Mensch und Tier |location=Universität Graz, in Graz, Austria |date=7 June 2017 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;br&gt;Finding [[Ruth Harrison]]'s book ''Animal Machines'' at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8djTnJvcATU&amp;t=23m36s 23m36s].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BoDMBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT258&amp;dq=%22Peter+Singer%22+%22Richard+Keshen%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Writings on an Ethical Life |first=Peter |last=Singer |year=2000 |page=258}}&lt;br&gt;Note: In this version of the story, Singer writes of the conversion process of himself and his wife happening "Over the next two months".&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending two years as a [[John Radcliffe (physician)|Radcliffe]] lecturer at [[University College, Oxford]], he was a visiting professor at [[New York University]] for 16 months. He returned to Melbourne in 1977, where he spent most of his career, aside from appointments as visiting faculty abroad, until his move to Princeton in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://petersinger.info/about-me-cv/ |title=Peter Singer: About Me |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cappe.edu.au |title=Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024030106/http://www.cappe.edu.au/ |archive-date=24 October 2009 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/ |title=Peter Singer: Works |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~worc0337/authors/peter.singer.html |title=Peter Singer: Life &amp; Work |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uc.princeton.edu/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=677&amp;Itemid=20 |title=Peter Singer: BBC/RSA Iconoclasts series Pt. 1 |location=London |date=5 September 2006 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012013948/https://uc.princeton.edu/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=677&amp;Itemid=20 |archive-date=12 October 2006 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/peter-singer |title=Columnist Peter Singer |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/can_you_do_good_by_eating_well/ |title=Can You Do Good by Eating Well? |magazine=Greater Good Magazine |date=1 March 2006 |first=Peter |last=Singer |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/19990905mag-poverty-singer.html |title=The Singer Solution to World Poverty |first=Peter |last=Singer |date=5 September 1999 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/singer02.pdf |title=All Animals Are Equal |first=Peter |last=Singer |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229012301/http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/singer02.pdf |archive-date=29 February 2008 |access-date=28 October 2018 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011 it was announced he would join the professoriate of [[New College of the Humanities]], a private college in London, in addition to his work at Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nchlondon.ac.uk/faculty/professor-peter-singer/ |title=The professoriate |publisher=New College of the Humanities |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has been a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2001.

==Applied ethics==
{{Utilitarianism}}
Singer's ''[[Practical Ethics]]'' (1979) analyzes why and how living beings' interests should be weighed. His principle of equal consideration of interests does not dictate equal treatment of all those with interests, since different interests warrant different treatment. All have an interest in avoiding pain, for instance, but relatively few have an interest in cultivating their abilities. Not only does his principle justify different treatment for different interests, but it allows different treatment for the same interest when [[marginal utility|diminishing marginal utility]] is a factor. For example, this approach would privilege a starving person's interest in food over the same interest of someone who is only slightly hungry.

Among the more important human interests are those in avoiding pain, in developing one's abilities, in satisfying basic needs for food and shelter, in enjoying warm personal relationships, in being free to pursue one's projects without interference, "and many others". The fundamental interest that entitles a being to equal consideration is the capacity for "suffering and/or enjoyment or happiness". Singer holds that a being's interests should always be weighed according to that being's concrete properties. The journey model is tolerant of some frustrated desire and explains why persons who have embarked on their journeys are not replaceable. Only a personal interest in continuing to live brings the journey model into play. This model also explains the priority that Singer attaches to ''interests'' over trivial desires and pleasures.

Ethical conduct is justified by reasons that go beyond prudence to "something bigger than the individual", addressing a larger audience. Singer thinks this going-beyond identifies moral reasons as "somehow universal", specifically in the injunction to 'love thy neighbour as thyself', interpreted by him as demanding that one give the same weight to the interests of others as one gives to one's own interests. This universalising step, which Singer traces from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to Hare,&lt;ref name="PracticalEthics2nd"&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Singer |title=Practical Ethics |edition=2nd |year=1993 |isbn=9780521439718 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZOmSTWZNdcC |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} is crucial and sets him apart from those moral theorists, from [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] to [[David Gauthier]], who tie morality to prudence. Universalisation leads directly to utilitarianism, Singer argues, on the strength of the thought that one's own interests cannot count for more than the interests of others. Taking these into account, one must weigh them up and adopt the course of action that is most likely to maximise the interests of those affected; utilitarianism has been arrived at. Singer's universalising step applies to interests without reference to who has them, whereas a Kantian's applies to the judgments of rational agents (in Kant's kingdom of ends, or [[John Rawls|Rawls]]'s Original Position, etc.). Singer regards Kantian universalisation as unjust to animals.&lt;ref&gt;Animal Liberation, pp. 211, 256&lt;/ref&gt; As for the Hobbesians, Singer attempts a response in the final chapter of ''Practical Ethics'', arguing that self-interested reasons support adoption of the moral point of view, such as 'the [[paradox of hedonism]]', which counsels that happiness is best found by not looking for it, and the need most people feel to relate to something larger than their own concerns.

===Effective altruism and world poverty===
{{main|Effective altruism}}
[[File:Peter Singer - Effective Altruism -Melb Australia Aug 2015.jpg|thumb|right|Singer at an effective altruism conference in [[Melbourne]] in 2015.]]
Singer's ideas have contributed to the rise of [[effective altruism]].&lt;ref name="sep-impartiality"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jollimore |first1=Troy |title=Impartiality |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/impartiality/ |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=28 October 2018 |date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that people should not only try to reduce suffering, but reduce it in the most effective manner possible. While Singer has previously written at length about the moral imperative to reduce poverty and eliminate the suffering of nonhuman animals, particularly in the [[meat industry]], he writes about how the effective altruism movement is doing these things more effectively in his 2015 book, ''[[The Most Good You Can Do]]''. He is a board member of Animal Charity Evaluators, a charity evaluator used by many members of the effective altruism community which recommends the most cost-effective animal advocacy charities and interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://animalcharityevaluators.org/about/contributors/meet-our-team/ |title=Board of Directors |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His own organisation, The Life You Can Save, also recommends a selection of charities deemed by charity evaluators such as [[GiveWell]] to be the most effective when it comes to helping those in extreme poverty. TLYCS was founded after Singer released his 2009 [[The Life You Can Save|eponymous book]], in which he argues more generally in favour of giving to charities that help to end global poverty. In particular, he expands upon some of the arguments made in his 1972 essay "[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality]]", in which he posits that citizens of rich nations are morally obligated to give at least some of their disposable income to charities that help the global poor. He supports this using the drowning child analogy, which states that most people would rescue a drowning child from a pond, even if it meant that their expensive clothes were ruined, so we clearly value a human life more than the value of our material possessions. As a result, we should take a significant portion of the money that we spend on our possessions and instead donate it to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Singer |url=https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm |title=The Drowning Child and the Expanding Circle |publisher=The Internationalist |date=April 1997 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skelton-tlycs-review"&gt;{{cite web |last=Skelton |first=Anthony |website=The Globe and Mail |title=Nobody can do everything, but everyone can do something |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/nobody-can-do-everything-but-everyone-can-do-something/article1149821/ |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal liberation and veganism===
[[File:Peter Singer no Fronteiras do Pensamento São Paulo 2013 (9733467088).jpg|thumb|right|Singer in [[São Paulo]] in 2013.]]
Published in 1975, ''Animal Liberation''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Animal Liberation: A New Ethics for our Treatment of Animals |location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=1975 |isbn=0-394-40096-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been cited as a formative influence on leaders of the modern animal liberation movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thankingthemonkey.com/about_karen_dawn.php |title=Karen Dawn's Biography |publisher=ThankingTheMonkey.com |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central argument of the book is an expansion of the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] concept that "the greatest good of the greatest number" is the only measure of good or ethical behaviour, and Singer believes that there is no reason not to apply this principle to other animals, arguing that the boundary between human and "animal" is completely arbitrary. There are far more differences, for instance, between a great ape and an oyster, for example, than between a human and a great ape, and yet the former two are lumped together as "animals", whereas we are considered "human" in a way that supposedly differentiates us from all other "animals."

He popularised the term "[[speciesism]]", which had been coined by English writer [[Richard D. Ryder]] to describe the practice of privileging humans over other animals, and therefore argues in favour of the equal consideration of interests of all sentient beings.&lt;ref name="Waldau2001p5"&gt;{{cite book |last=Waldau |first=Paul |year=2001 |title=The Specter of Speciesism: Buddhist and Christian Views of Animals |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=5, 23–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Animal Liberation'', Singer argues in favour of veganism and against animal experimentation. Singer describes himself as a flexible vegan. He writes, "That is, I'm vegan when it's not too difficult to be vegan, but I'm not rigid about this, if I'm traveling for example."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An AMA with Peter Singer, author of Animal Liberation, The Life You Can Save, Practical Ethics, and The Most Good You Can Do. |work=/r/IAmA |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w9n40/an_ama_with_peter_singer_author_of_animal/ |date=10 December 2015 |publisher=Reddit |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for the online publication [[Chinadialogue]], Singer called Western-style meat production cruel, unhealthy, and damaging to the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/326-The-ethics-of-eating |title=The ethics of eating |first=Peter |last=Singer |date=30 August 2006 |work=chinadialogue.net |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the idea that the method was necessary to meet the population's increasing demand, explaining that animals in [[factory farm]]s have to eat food grown explicitly for them, and they burn up most of the food's energy just to breathe and keep their bodies warm. In a 2010 Guardian article he titled, "Fish: the forgotten victims on our plate," Singer drew attention to the welfare of fish. He quoted (author) Alison Mood's startling statistics from a report she wrote, which was released on fishcount.org.uk just a month before the Guardian article. Singer states that she "has put together what may well be the first-ever systematic estimate of the size of the annual global capture of wild fish. It is, she calculates, in the order of one trillon, although it could be as high as 2.7tn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2010/sep/14/fish-forgotten-victims |title=Fish: the forgotten victims on our plate |date=14 September 2010 |work=The Guardian |access-date=28 October 2018 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.fishcount.org.uk/published/standard/fishcountfullrptSR.pdf |title=Worse things happen at sea: the welfare of wild-caught fish |last=Mood |first=Alison |publisher=fishcount.org.uk |year=2010 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some chapters of ''Animal Liberation'' are dedicated to criticising testing on animals but, unlike groups such as [[PETA]], Singer is willing to accept such testing when there is a clear benefit for medicine.  In November 2006, Singer appeared on the BBC programme ''Monkeys, Rats and Me: Animal Testing'' and said that he felt that [[Tipu Aziz]]'s experiments on monkeys for research into treating Parkinson's disease could be justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mangan |first=Lucy |date=28 November 2006 |location=London |newspaper=The Guardian |title=Last night's TV |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/nov/28/animalwelfare.television |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas Singer has continued since the publication of ''Animal Liberation'' to promote vegetarianism and veganism, he has been much less vocal in recent years on the subject of animal experimentation.

Singer has defended some of the actions of the [[Animal Liberation Front]], such as the stealing of footage from Dr. Thomas Gennarelli's laboratory in May 1984 (as shown in the documentary ''[[Unnecessary Fuss]]''), but he has condemned other actions such as the use of explosives by some animal-rights activists and sees the freeing of captive animals as largely futile when they are easily replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |date=28 October 2011 |title=Practical Ethics |edition=3rd |location=UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=274 |isbn=9781139496896}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |year=2015 |title=Animal Liberation (preface in 2015 revised edition) |location=UK |publisher=Random House |page=xxix |isbn=9781473524422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===

====Meta-ethical views====

In the past, Singer has not held that objective moral values exist, on the basis that reason could favour both egoism and [[equal consideration of interests]]. Singer himself adopted utilitarianism on the basis that people's preferences can be universalised, leading to a situation where one takes the "point of view of the universe" and "an impartial standpoint". But in the Second Edition of ''Practical Ethics'', he concedes that the question of why we should act morally "cannot be given an answer that will provide everyone with overwhelming reasons for acting morally".&lt;ref name="PracticalEthics2nd" /&gt;{{rp|335}}

However, when co-authoring ''The Point of View of the Universe'' (2014), Singer shifted to the position that objective moral values do exist, and defends the 19th century utilitarian philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]]'s view that objective morality can be derived from fundamental moral axioms that are knowable by reason. Additionally, he endorses [[Derek Parfit]]'s view that there are object-given reasons for action.&lt;ref name="POVUniverse"&gt;{{cite book |last1=de Lazari-Radek |first1=Katarzyna |last2=Singer |first2=Peter |title=The Point of View of the Universe: Sidgwick and Contemporary Ethics |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|126}} Furthermore, Singer and [[Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek]] (the co-author of the book) argue that evolutionary debunking arguments can be used to demonstrate that it is more rational to take the impartial standpoint of "the point of view of the universe", as opposed to egoism—pursuing one's own self-interest—because the existence of egoism is more likely to be the product of evolution by natural selection, rather than because it is correct, whereas taking an impartial standpoint and equally considering the interests of all sentient beings is in conflict with what we would expect from natural selection, meaning that it is more likely that impartiality in ethics is the correct stance to pursue.&lt;ref name="POVUniverse" /&gt;{{rp|182-183}}

====Political views====
[[File:Peter Singer 2017-01 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Singer in 2017]]
Whilst a student in Melbourne, Singer campaigned against the [[Vietnam War]] as president of the Melbourne University Campaign Against Conscription.&lt;ref name="StudentPolitics"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schaler |first=Jeffrey A. |date=30 September 2011 |title=Peter Singer Under Fire: The Moral Iconoclast Faces His Critics |publisher=Open Court |pages=7 |isbn=9780812697698}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also spoke publicly for the legalisation of [[abortion]] in Australia.&lt;ref name=StudentPolitics/&gt;
Singer joined the [[Labor Party (Australia)|Australian Labor Party]] in 1974, but resigned after disillusionment with the centrist leadership of [[Bob Hawke]].&lt;ref name="Politics"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schaler |first=Jeffrey A. |date=30 September 2011 |title=Peter Singer Under Fire: The Moral Iconoclast Faces His Critics |publisher=Open Court |pages=58–59 |isbn=9780812697698}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992, he became a founding member of the [[Victorian Greens]].&lt;ref name=Politics/&gt; He has run for political office twice for the Greens: in 1994 he received 28% of the vote in the [[Kooyong by-election, 1994|Kooyong by-election]], and in 1996 he received 3% of the vote when running for the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] (elected by [[proportional representation]]).&lt;ref name=Politics/&gt;  Before the 1996 election, he co-authored a book ''The Greens'' with [[Bob Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singer |first1=Peter |last2=Brown |first2=Bob |date=28 October 1996 |title=The Greens |publisher=Text Publishing Company |isbn=9781875847174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[A Darwinian Left]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Singer |title=A Darwinian Left: Politics, Evolution, and Cooperation |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-300-08323-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer outlines a plan for the [[leftism|political left]] to adapt to the lessons of [[evolutionary biology]]. He says that [[evolutionary psychology]] suggests that humans naturally tend to be self-interested. He further argues that the evidence that selfish tendencies are natural must not be taken as evidence that selfishness is "right." He concludes that [[game theory]] (the mathematical study of strategy) and experiments in psychology offer hope that self-interested people will make short-term sacrifices for the good of others, if society provides the right conditions. Essentially, Singer claims that although humans possess selfish, competitive tendencies naturally, they have a substantial capacity for [[co-operation (evolution)|cooperation]] that also has been selected for during [[human evolution]]. Singer's writing in ''Greater Good'' magazine, published by the [[Greater Good Science Center]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], includes the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships.

Singer has criticized the United States for receiving "oil from countries run by dictators .... who pocket most of the" financial gains, thus "keeping the people in poverty." Singer believes that the wealth of these countries "should belong to the people" within them rather than their "de facto government.  In paying dictators for their oil, we are in effect buying stolen goods, and helping to keep people in poverty." Singer holds that America "should be doing more to assist people in extreme poverty". He is disappointed in U.S. foreign aid policy, deeming it "a very small proportion of our GDP, less than a quarter of some other affluent nations." Singer maintains that little "private philanthropy from the U.S." is "directed to helping people in extreme poverty, although there are some exceptions, most notably, of course, the Gates Foundation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanfranciscoreviewofbooks.com/2017/09/interview-how-do-practical-ethics-work.html |title=Interview: How do practical ethics work in the average American's life? Peter Singer explains. |last=Cotto |first=Joseph Ford |date=26 September 2017 |website=[[San Francisco Review of Books]] |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer describes himself as not anti-capitalist, stating in a 2010 interview with the New Left Project:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newleftproject.org/index.php/site/article_comments/ethics_and_the_left/ |title=Ethics And The Left |first1=Peter |last1=Singer |first2=Edward |last2=Lewis |publisher=Newleftproject.org |date=16 March 2010 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Capitalism is very far from a perfect system, but so far we have yet to find anything that clearly does a better job of meeting human needs than a regulated capitalist economy coupled with a welfare and health care system that meets the basic needs of those who do not thrive in the capitalist economy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He added that "[i]f we ever do find a better system, I'll be happy to call myself an anti-capitalist".

Similarly, in his book ''Marx'', Singer is sympathetic to Marx's criticism of capitalism, but is skeptical about whether a better system is likely to be created, writing: "Marx saw that capitalism is a wasteful, irrational system, a system which controls us when we should be controlling it. That insight is still valid; but we can now see that the construction of a free and equal society is a more difficult task than Marx realised."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Singer |title=Marx: A Very Short Introduction |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qZoHsHY3Y4sC |isbn=9780192854056 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer is opposed to the death penalty, claiming that it does not effectively deter the crimes for which it is the punitive measure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-death-penalty---again |title=The Death Penalty – Again |work=[[Project Syndicate]] |date=12 October 2011 |first=Peter |last=Singer |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he cannot see any other justification for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/audio/data/000619 |first1=Peter |last1=Singer |first2=Julia Taylor |last2=Kennedy |title=ETHICS MATTER: A Conversation with Peter Singer |work=[[Policy Innovations]] |date=17 October 2011 |access-date=28 October 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508223211/http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/audio/data/000619 |archive-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Singer signed a petition renouncing his 'right of return' to Israel, which called it "a form of racist privilege that abets the colonial oppression of the Palestinians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Goldberg |url=https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/interviews/72965/peter-singer-he-really-most-dangerous-man-world |title=Peter Singer: is he really the most dangerous man in the world? |publisher=The Jewish Chronicle |date=16 August 2012 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Views on the Trump administration=====
In 2016, Singer called on [[Jill Stein]] to withdraw from the [[United States presidential election, 2016|US presidential election]] in states that were close between [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Donald Trump]], on the grounds that "The stakes are too high".&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/jill-stein-should-withdraw-battleground-states-by-peter-singer-2016-08 |first=Peter |last=Singer |title=Greens for Trump? |work=Project Syndicate |date=11 August 2016 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued against the view that there was no significant difference between Clinton and Trump, whilst also saying that he would not advocate such a tactic in Australia's electoral system, which allows for ranking of preferences.&lt;ref name=Stein/&gt;

When writing in 2017 on Trump's denial of climate change and plans to withdraw from the Paris accords, Singer advocated a boycott of all consumer goods from the United States to pressure the Trump administration to change its environmental policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-climate-disater-boycott-america-by-peter-singer-2017-04 |title=Boycott America? |last=Singer |first=Peter |date=6 April 2017 |website=Project Syndicate |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/paris-accord-unfair-to-america-by-peter-singer-2017-06 |title=Is the Paris Accord Unfair to America? |last=Singer |first=Peter |date=5 June 2017 |website=Project Syndicate |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abortion, euthanasia, and infanticide====
[[File:Peter Singer.jpg|thumb|Singer lecturing at [[Oxford University]]]]
Singer holds that the right to life is essentially tied to a being's capacity to hold preferences, which in turn is essentially tied to a being's capacity to feel pain and pleasure.

In ''Practical Ethics'', Singer argues in favour of [[abortion rights]] on the grounds that fetuses are neither rational nor self-aware, and can therefore hold no preferences. As a result, he argues that the preference of a mother to have an abortion automatically takes precedence. In sum, Singer argues that a fetus lacks personhood.

Similar to his argument for abortion rights, Singer argues that newborns lack the essential characteristics of personhood—"rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1993----.htm Taking Life: Humans], Excerpted from Practical Ethics, 2nd edition, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;—and therefore "killing a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person, that is, a being who wants to go on living".&lt;ref name=SingerFAQ&gt;{{cite web |last=Singer |first=Peter |url=https://petersinger.info/faq/ |title=Peter Singer FAQ |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer has clarified that his "view of when life begins isn’t very different from that of opponents of abortion." He deems it not "unreasonable to hold that an individual human life begins at conception. If it doesn’t, then it begins about 14 days later, when it is no longer possible for the embryo to divide into twins or other multiples." Singer disagrees with abortion rights opponents in that he does not "think that the fact that an embryo is a living human being is sufficient to show that it is wrong to kill it." Singer wishes "to see American jurisprudence, and the national abortion debate, take up the question of which capacities a human being needs to have in order for it to be wrong kill it" as well as "when, in the development of the early human being, these capacities are present."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanfranciscoreviewofbooks.com/2017/09/interview-when-does-human-life-begin.html |title=When does human life begin -- and what does this really mean? Peter Singer explains. |last=Cotto |first=Joseph Ford |website=[[San Francisco Review of Books]] |date=27 September 2017 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer classifies [[euthanasia]] as [[voluntary euthanasia|voluntary]], [[involuntary euthanasia|involuntary]], or [[non-voluntary euthanasia|non-voluntary]]. Voluntary euthanasia is that to which the subject consents. He argues in favour of voluntary euthanasia and some forms of non-voluntary euthanasia, including infanticide in certain instances, but opposes involuntary euthanasia.

Religious critics have argued that Singer's ethic ignores and undermines the traditional notion of the [[sanctity of life]]. Singer agrees and believes the notion of the sanctity of life ought to be discarded as outdated, unscientific, and irrelevant to understanding problems in contemporary bioethics. Bioethicists associated with the [[Disability Rights]] and [[Disability Studies]] communities have argued that his epistemology is based on [[ableist]] conceptions of disability.&lt;ref name="WOAL-interview"&gt;{{cite book |title=Writings on an Ethical Life |first=Peter |last=Singer |chapter=An Interview |pages=319–329 |isbn=1841155500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer's positions have also been criticised by some advocates for [[disability rights]] and [[right-to-life]] supporters, concerned with what they see as his attacks upon [[human dignity]]. Singer has replied that many people judge him based on secondhand summaries and short quotations taken out of context, not his books or articles and, that his aim is to elevate the status of animals, not to lower that of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZOmSTWZNdcC |title=Practical Ethics |first=Peter |last=Singer |year=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521439718 |quote=[T]he aim of my argument is to elevate the status of animals rather than to lower the status of any humans |pages=77-78 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; American publisher [[Steve Forbes]] ceased his donations to [[Princeton University]] in 1999 because of Singer's appointment to a prestigious professorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euthanasia.com/forb.html |title=Steve Forbes Declines Princeton Financial Backing Due to Singer Hiring |publisher=Euthanasia.com |date=21 September 1999 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi-hunter [[Simon Wiesenthal]] wrote to organisers of a Swedish book fair to which Singer was invited that "A professor of morals ... who justifies the right to kill handicapped newborns ... is in my opinion unacceptable for representation at your level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Don |last=Felder |url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/feder102898.asp |title=Professor Death will fit right in at Princeton |publisher=[[Jewish World Review]] |date=28 October 1998 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marc Maurer, President of the [[National Federation of the Blind]], criticised Singer's appointment to the Princeton Faculty in a banquet speech at the organisation's national convention in July 2001, claiming that Singer's support for euthanising disabled babies could lead to disabled older children and adults being valued less as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nfb.org//Images/nfb/Publications/convent/banque01.htm |title=Independence and the Necessity for Diplomacy |date=6 July 2001 |publisher=Nfb.org |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative psychiatrist [[Theodore Dalrymple]] wrote in 2010 that Singerian moral universalism is "preposterous—psychologically, theoretically, and practically".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Dalrymple |first=Theodore |title=[[Spoilt Rotten: The Toxic Cult of Sentimentality]] |publisher=Gibson Square Books Ltd |year=2010 |isbn=1-906142-61-0 |page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 disability rights activist [[Harriet McBryde Johnson]] debated Singer, challenging his belief that it is morally permissible to [[euthanasia|euthanize]] new-born children with severe disabilities. "Unspeakable Conversations", Johnson's account of her encounters with Singer and the pro-euthanasia movement, was published in the ''New York Times Magazine'' in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/16/magazine/unspeakable-conversations.html |first=Harriet |last=McBryde Johnson |title=Unspeakable Conversations |publisher=The New York Times Magazine |date=16 February 2003 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also served as inspiration for ''The Thrill'', a 2013 play by [[Judith Thompson]] partly based on Johnson's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.stratfordbeaconherald.com/2013/08/14/strength-of-judith-thompsons-new-play-the-thrill-is-asking-provocative-complex-questions/wcm/9e5b8e8b-b44c-07d1-c686-36038967def4 |first=Donal |last=O'Connor |title=Strength of Judith Thompson's new play The Thrill is asking provocative, complex questions |publisher=The Beacon Herald |date=14 August 2013 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer has experienced the complexities of some of these questions in his own life. His mother had [[Alzheimer's disease]]. He said, "I think this has made me see how the issues of someone with these kinds of problems are really very difficult".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.michaelspecter.com/1999/09/the-dangerous-philosopher/ |publisher=Michael Specter |title=The Dangerous Philosopher |date=6 September 1999 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Ronald Bailey]], published in December 2000, he explained that his sister shares the responsibility of making decisions about his mother. He did say that, if he were solely responsible, his mother might not continue to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Ronald |last=Bailey |url=https://reason.com/archives/2000/12/01/the-pursuit-of-happiness-peter |title=The Pursuit of Happiness, Peter Singer interviewed by Ronald Bailey |date=December 2000 |magazine=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Surrogacy====
In 1985, Singer wrote a book with the physician Deanne Wells arguing that surrogate motherhood should be allowed and regulated by the state by establishing nonprofit 'State Surrogacy Boards', which would ensure fairness between surrogate mothers and surrogacy-seeking parents. Singer and Wells endorsed both the payment of medical expenses endured by surrogate mothers and an extra "fair fee" to compensate the surrogate mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singer |first1=Peter |last2=Wells |first2=Deane |title=Making Babies: The New Science and Ethics of Conception |year=1987 |publisher=C.

====Religion====
[[File:Peter Singer MIT Veritas.jpg|thumb|right|Singer at a [[Veritas Forum]] event at [[MIT]] in 2009.]]
Singer was a speaker at the 2012 [[Global Atheist Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atheistconvention.org.au/peter-singer/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131201121355/http://www.atheistconvention.org.au/peter-singer/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 December 2013 |title=Peter Singer |work=.atheistconvention.org.au |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has debated with Christians such as [[John Lennox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/tv/bigideas/stories/2011/09/06/3310342.htm |title=Singer vs Lennox: Is There a God? |work=ABC.net.au |date=6 September 2011 |access-date=28 October 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127094518/https://www.abc.net.au/tv/bigideas/stories/2011/09/06/3310342.htm |archive-date=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dinesh D'Souza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Isia |last=Jaasiewicz |url=https://paw.princeton.edu/article/singer-dsouza-face-over-religion-and-morality |title=Singer, D'Souza face off over religion and morality |work=Princeton Alumni Weekly |date=28 January 2009 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer has pointed to [[the problem of evil]] as an objection against the Christian conception of God. He stated: "The evidence of our own eyes makes it more plausible to believe that the world was not created by any god at all. If, however, we insist on believing in divine creation, we are forced to admit that the god who made the world cannot be all-powerful and all good. He must be either evil or a bungler."&lt;ref name="god"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-god-of-suffering |title=The God of Suffering? |author=Peter Singer |work=Project Syndicate |date=8 May 2008 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with his considerations of non-human animals, Singer also takes issue with the original sin reply to the problem of evil, saying that, "animals also suffer from floods, fires, and droughts, and, since they are not descended from Adam and Eve, they cannot have inherited original sin."&lt;ref name="god"/&gt;

==== Protests ====
[[File:Peter Singer no Fronteiras do Pensamento Porto Alegre (9620101528).jpg|thumb|right|Singer lecturing in [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil, in 2012.]]
In 1989 and 1990, Peter Singer's work was the subject of a number of protests in Germany. A course in ethics led by Dr. Hartmut Kliemt at the [[University of Duisburg]] where the main text used was Singer's ''Practical Ethics'' was, according to Singer, "subjected to organised and repeated disruption by protesters objecting to the use of the book on the grounds that in one of its ten chapters it advocates active euthanasia for severely disabled newborn infants". The protests led to the course being shut down.&lt;ref name="SilencedInGermany"&gt;{{cite book |title=Writings on an Ethical Life |first=Peter |last=Singer |chapter=On Being Silenced in Germany |pages=303–318 |isbn=1841155500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Singer tried to speak during a lecture at [[Saarbrücken]], he was interrupted by a group of protesters including advocates for [[disability rights]]. One of the protesters expressed that entering serious discussions would be a tactical error.&lt;ref&gt;Holger Dorf, "Singer in Saabrücken", ''Unirevue'' (Winter Semester, 1989/90), p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Singer was invited to speak in [[Marburg]] at a European symposium on "Bioengineering, Ethics and Mental Disability". The invitation was fiercely attacked by leading intellectuals and organisations in German media, with an article in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' comparing Singer's positions to [[Nazism]]. Eventually, the symposium was cancelled and Singer's invitation consequently withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sheri Berman |url=http://bc.barnard.edu/~sberman/Pages/publications/Brill.pdf |title=Euthanasia, Eugenics and Fascism: How Close are the Connections |publisher=German Politics and Society 17(3) |date=Fall 1999 |archive-date=2 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402234446/http://bc.barnard.edu/~sberman/Pages/publications/Brill.pdf |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lecture at the Zoological Institute of the [[University of Zurich]] also was interrupted by two groups of protesters. The first group was a group of disabled people who staged a brief protest at the beginning of the lecture. They objected to inviting an advocate of euthanasia to speak. At the end of this protest, when Singer tried to address their concerns, a second group of protesters rose and began chanting "''Singer raus! Singer raus!''" ("Singer out!") When Singer attempted to respond, a protester jumped on stage and grabbed his glasses, and the host ended the lecture. The first group of protesters was distressed by this second, more aggressive group. It had not intended to halt the lecture and even had questions to ask Singer. Singer explains "my views are not threatening to anyone, even minimally" and says that some groups play on the anxieties of those who hear only keywords that are understandably worrying (given the constant fears of ever repeating the Holocaust) if taken with any less than the full context of his belief system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://criticanarede.com/html/ed99.html |title=Criticanarede.com |publisher=Criticanarede.com |date=31 May 2005 |access-date=28 October 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122145916/http://criticanarede.com/html/ed99.html |archive-date=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PracticalEthics2nd" /&gt;{{rp|pages=346–359}}

In 1991, Singer was due to speak along with [[R. M. Hare]] and Georg Meggle at the 15th [[International Wittgenstein Symposium]] in [[Kirchberg am Wechsel]], [[Austria]]. Singer has stated that threats were made to Adolf Hübner, then the president of the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society, that the conference would be disrupted if Singer and Meggle were given a platform. Hübner proposed to the board of the society that Singer's invitation (as well as the invitations of a number of other speakers) be withdrawn. The Society decided to cancel the symposium.&lt;ref name="SilencedInGermany" /&gt;

In an article originally published in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', Singer argued that the protests dramatically increased the amount of coverage he got: "instead of a few hundred people hearing views at lectures in Marburg and Dortmund, several millions read about them or listened to them on television". Despite this, Singer argues that it has led to a difficult intellectual climate, with professors in Germany unable to teach courses on applied ethics and campaigns demanding the resignation of professors who invited Singer to speak.&lt;ref name="SilencedInGermany" /&gt;

==Honours==
Singer was inducted into the United States [[Animal Rights Hall of Fame]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arconference.org/hall-of-fame.htm |title=U.S. Animal Rights Hall of Fame |publisher=Animal Rights National Conference |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 June 2012, Singer was appointed a [[Order of Australia|Companion of the Order of Australia]] (AC) for "eminent service to philosophy and bioethics as a leader of public debate and communicator of ideas in the areas of global poverty, animal welfare and the human condition."&lt;ref name="companion"&gt;{{cite web |title=Companion (AC) in the General Division of the Order of Australia – The Queen's Birthday 2012 Honours Lists |url=https://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/honours/qb/qb2012/Media%20Notes%20AC%20%28final%29.pdf |publisher=[[Official Secretary to the Governor-General of Australia]] |page=8 |date=16 June 2012 |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer received ''[[Philosophy Now]]'''s 2016 Award for Contributions in the Fight Against Stupidity for his efforts "to disturb the comfortable complacency with which many of us habitually ignore the desperate needs of others ... particularly for this work as it relates to the Effective Altruism movement."&lt;ref name="PNaward"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philosophynow.org/award |title=The ''Philosophy Now'' Award for Contributions in the Fight Against Stupidity |publisher=Philosophy Now |access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its [[bylaws]], the academy's main goals are the cultivation of [[Romanian language]] and [[Romanian literature]], the study of the [[History of Romania|national history of Romania]] and research into major scientific domains. Some of the academy's fundamental projects are the Romanian language [[dictionary]] (''[[Dicționarul explicativ al limbii române]]''), the dictionary of Romanian literature, and the treatise on the history of the Romanian people.

==History==
On the initiative of [[C.A. Rosetti]], the Academy was founded on April 1, 1866, as ''Societatea Literară Română''.  The founding members were illustrious members of the Romanian society of the age.

The name changed to ''Societatea Academică Romînă'' in 1867, and finally to ''Academia Română'' in 1879, during the reign of [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]].

The founding members of the Academy:

{{corporal punishment}}

'''School [[corporal punishment]]''' refers to causing deliberate pain or discomfort in response to undesired behaviour by students in schools. It often involves striking the student either across the buttocks&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://www.alex.k12.al.us/handbook/hand.pdf Student/Parent Information Guide and Code of Conduct 2008-2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824024436/http://www.alex.k12.al.us/handbook/hand.pdf |date=24 August 2009 }}, Alexander City Schools, Alabama, USA, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt; or on the hands,&lt;ref name="toronto"/&gt; with an implement such as a rattan [[caning|cane]], wooden [[Paddle (spanking)|paddle]], [[Slippering (punishment)|slipper]], leather [[Strapping (punishment)|strap]] or wooden yardstick. Less commonly, it could also include [[spanking]] or smacking the student with the open hand, especially at the [[elementary school]] level.

In the English-speaking world, the use by schools of corporal punishment has historically been justified by the common-law doctrine ''[[in loco parentis]]'', whereby teachers are considered authority figures granted the same rights as parents to punish children in their care.

Advocates of school corporal punishment argue that it provides an immediate response to indiscipline and that the student is quickly back in the classroom learning, as opposed to [[Suspension (punishment)|suspension]] from school. Opponents, including a number of medical and psychological societies, along with [[human-rights]] groups, argue that physical punishment is ineffective in the long term, interferes with learning, leads to antisocial behavior as well as various forms of mental distress, disproportionately affects students of color, and is a form of violence that breaches the rights of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gershoff, E.T. &amp; Font, S.A.|first=|date=2016|title=Corporal punishment in U.S. public schools: Prevalence, disparities in use, and status in state and federal policy|url=http://www.nospank.net/gershoff.pdf|journal=Society for Research and Child Development|volume=30|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland was the first nation to outlaw corporal punishment in schools in 1783. School corporal punishment is no longer legal in any European country. As of 2016, an estimated 128 countries have prohibited corporal punishment in schools, including all of Europe, and most of South America and East Asia. Approximately 69 countries still allow for corporal punishment in schools, including parts of the [[United States]], some [[Australia]]n states, and a number of countries in Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gershoff|first=Elizabeth|date=2017|title=School corporal punishment in global perspective: prevalence, outcomes, and efforts at intervention|journal=Psychology, Health &amp; Medicine|volume=22|issue=sup1|pages=sup1, 224–239|doi=10.1080/13548506.2016.1271955|pmid=28064515|pmc=5560991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
[[File:Koerperstrafe- MA Birkenrute.png|thumb|right|150px|Medieval schoolboy birched on the bare buttocks]]
Corporal punishment in the context of schools in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has been variously defined as: causing deliberate pain to a child in response to the child's undesired behavior and/or language,&lt;ref name=AACAP&gt;{{cite web |title=Corporal Punishment in Schools |url=https://www.aacap.org/aacap/policy_statements/1988/Corporal_Punishment_in_Schools.aspx |publisher=American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "purposeful infliction of bodily pain or discomfort by an official in the educational system upon a student as a penalty for unacceptable behavior",&lt;ref name=Pediatricians&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poole, Steven R. |display-authors=etal |title=The role of the pediatrician in abolishing corporal punishment in schools |journal=Pediatrics |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=162–7 |date=July 1991 |pmid=2057255 |doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "intentional application of physical pain as a means of changing behavior" (not the occasional use of physical restraint to protect student or others from immediate harm).&lt;ref name=SAM2003&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Greydanus, D.E. |author2=Pratt, H.D. |author3=Spates, Richard C. |author4=Blake-Dreher, A.E. |author5=Greydanus-Gearhart, M.A. |author6=Patel, D.R. |title=Corporal punishment in schools: position paper of the Society for Adolescent Medicine |journal=J Adolesc Health |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=385–93 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12729988 |doi=10.1016/S1054-139X(03)00042-9 |url=http://www.adolescenthealth.org/PositionPaper_Corporal_Punishment_in_Schools.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419115418/http://www.adolescenthealth.org/PositionPaper_Corporal_Punishment_in_Schools.pdf |archivedate=19 April 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
Corporal punishment used to be prevalent in schools in many parts of the world, but in recent decades it has been outlawed in 128 countries including all of Europe, most of South America, as well as in Canada, Japan, South Africa, New Zealand and several other countries. It remains commonplace in a number of countries in Africa, [[Southeast Asia]], and the Middle East (see list of countries, below).

While most [[U.S. state]]s have outlawed corporal punishment in [[state school]]s, it continues to be allowed mainly in the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Western United States|Western]] United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2012/03/13/148521155/spanking-lives-on-in-rural-florida-schools "Spanking Lives On In Rural Florida Schools"] (15 March 2012). NPR.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United States Department of Education]], more than 216,000 students were subjected to corporal punishment during the 2008{{ndash}}09 school year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21632521-spanking-makes-your-children-stupid-spare-rod "Spare the rod"] (15 November 2014). ''The Economist''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the traditional culture that surrounds corporal punishment in school, at any rate in the [[English-speaking world]], derives largely from British practice in the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly as regards the caning of teenage boys.&lt;ref name="corpunuk"&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/counuks.htm United Kingdom: Corporal punishment in schools] at World Corporal Punishment Research.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a vast amount of literature on this, in both popular and serious culture.&lt;ref&gt;Quigly, Isabel (1984). ''The Heirs of Tom Brown: The English School Story''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-281404-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandos, John (1984). ''Boys Together: English Public Schools 1800-1864''. London: Hutchinson, esp. chapter 11. {{ISBN|0-09-139240-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain itself outlawed the practice in 1987 for state schools&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK | type = act | year = 1986 | chapter = 61 | act = Education (No. 2) Act 1986 }} Section 47 for England and Wales and section 48 for Scotland, brought into force in 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]]. ''[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1987/461 Education (Corporal Punishment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1987]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Mark (9 January 2007). [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jan/09/schools.uk1 "Sparing the rod"]. ''The Guardian'' (London).&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently for all schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK | type = act | year = 1998 | chapter = 31 | act = School Standards and Framework Act 1998 }} Section 131, for England and Wales, brought into force in 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Colin (25 March 1998). [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/last-vestiges-of-caning-swept-away-1152260.html "Last vestiges of caning swept away"]. ''The Independent'' (London).&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of ''[[in loco parentis]]'' lets school officials stand in for parents as comparable authority figures.&lt;ref name=Pediatricians/&gt; The doctrine has its origins in an [[English common-law]] precedent of 1770.&lt;ref name=SAM2003/&gt;

[[File:'February - Cutting Weather - Squally' - George Cruikshank, 1839 - BL.jpg|thumb|left|1839 caricature by [[George Cruikshank]] of a school flogging]]
Many schools in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] use caning (for boys) as a routine official punishment for misconduct, as also some African countries. In some Middle Eastern countries whipping is used. (See list of countries, below.)

In most of continental Europe, school corporal punishment has been banned for several decades or longer, depending on the country (see the list of countries below).

From the 1917 Russian revolution onwards, corporal punishment was outlawed in the [[Soviet Union]], because it was deemed contrary to communist ideology.&lt;ref name="Teitelbaum1945"&gt;Teitelbaum, Salomon M. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2491761 "Parental Authority in the Soviet Union"], in ''American Slavic and East European Review'', Vol. 4, No. 3/4 (December 1945), pp. 54-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Communists in other countries such as Britain took the lead in campaigning against school corporal punishment, which they viewed as a symptom of the decadence of capitalist education systems.&lt;ref&gt;Linehan, Thomas P. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=LY7QGOMIqRsC ''Communism in Britain, 1920-39: From the cradle to the grave''], Manchester University Press. pp. 32 ff. {{ISBN|0-7190-7140-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, Soviet visitors to western schools expressed shock at the caning of boys there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/uksc6011.htm "Caning? It's not cricket, say the Russians at Rugby"]. ''Daily Mail'' (London). 22 November 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; Other communist regimes followed suit: for instance, corporal punishment was "unknown" by students in North Korea in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/krs00703.htm#19022 "North Korean Defectors Face Huge Challenges"]. ''Radio Free Asia''. 21 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In mainland China, corporal punishment in schools was outlawed in 1986,&lt;ref name="Country report for China"&gt;[http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/progress/country-reports/china.html "Country report for China"]. Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children.&lt;/ref&gt; although the practice remains common, especially in rural areas.&lt;ref name="corpun.com"&gt;Paul Wiseman, [http://www.corpun.com/cns00005.htm "Chinese schools try to unlearn brutality"], ''USA Today'', Washington D.C., 9 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], there are three broad rationales for the use of corporal punishment in schools: beliefs, based in traditional religion, that adults have a right, if not a duty, to physically punish misbehaving children; a disciplinary philosophy that corporal punishment builds character, being necessary for the development of a child's conscience and their respect for adult authority figures; and beliefs concerning the needs and rights of teachers, specifically that corporal punishment is essential for maintaining order and control in the classroom.&lt;ref name=Pediatricians/&gt;

School officials and policymakers often rely on personal [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotes]] to argue that school corporal punishment improves students' behavior and achievement.&lt;ref name=Gershoff2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gershoff, Elizabeth T. |date=Spring 2010 |title=More Harm Than Good: A Summary of Scientific Research on the Intended and Unintended Effects of Corporal Punishment on Children |url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol73/iss2/3/ |journal=Law &amp; Contemporary Problems |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=31–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a lack of empirical evidence showing that corporal punishment leads to better control in the classroom. In particular, evidence does not suggest that it enhances moral character development, increases students' respect for teachers or other authority figures, or offers greater security for teachers.&lt;ref name="Greydanus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edworkforce.house.gov/uploadedfiles/04.15.10_greydandus.pdf|title=Corporal Punishment in Schools and its Effect on Academic Success: Testimony by Donald E.

A number of medical, pediatric or psychological societies have issued statements opposing all corporal punishment in schools, citing such outcomes as poorer academic achievement, increases in antisocial behaviour, injuries to students, and an unwelcoming learning environment. They include the [[American Medical Association]],&lt;ref name="NCACPS list"&gt;[https://www.ama-assn.org/ssl3/ecomm/PolicyFinderForm.pl?site=www.ama-assn.org&amp;uri=/resources/html/PolicyFinder/policyfiles/HnE/H-515.995.HTM "H-515.995 Corporal Punishment in Schools"].

According to the AAP, research shows that corporal punishment is less effective than other methods of behaviour management in schools, and "praise, discussions regarding values, and positive role models do more to develop character, respect, and values than does corporal punishment".&lt;ref name=Pediatricians/&gt; They say that evidence links corporal punishment of students to a number of adverse outcomes, including: "increased aggressive and destructive behaviour, increased disruptive classroom behaviour, vandalism, poor school achievement, poor attention span, increased drop-out rate, school avoidance and school phobia, low self-esteem, anxiety, somatic complaints, [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[suicide]] and retaliation against teachers".&lt;ref name=Pediatricians/&gt; The AAP recommends a number of alternatives to corporal punishment including various nonviolent behaviour-management strategies, modifications to the school environment, and increased support for teachers.&lt;ref name=Pediatricians/&gt;

===Injuries to students===
An estimated 1 to 2 percent of physically punished students in the United States are seriously injured, to the point of needing medical attention. According to the AAP and the Society for Adolescent Medicine, these injuries have included [[Ecchymosis|bruises]], [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasions]], [[Bone fracture|broken bones]], [[whiplash injury]], muscle damage, [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]], and even death.&lt;ref name=Pediatricians/&gt;&lt;ref name=SAM2003/&gt; Other reported injuries to students include "[[Sciatica|sciatic nerve damage]]"&lt;ref name=Pediatricians/&gt; "extensive [[hematomas]]", and "life-threatening fat [[Bleeding|hemorrhage]]".&lt;ref name=SAM2003/&gt;

===Promotion of violence===
The AAP cautions that there is a risk of corporal punishment in schools [[Social learning theory|fostering the impression among students]] that violence is an appropriate means for managing others' behaviour.&lt;ref name=Pediatricians/&gt; According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, "Corporal punishment signals to the child that a way to settle interpersonal conflicts is to use physical force and inflict pain".&lt;ref name=AACAP/&gt; And according to the Society for Adolescent Medicine, "The use of corporal punishment in schools promotes a very precarious message: that violence is an acceptable phenomenon in our society. It sanctions the notion that it is meritorious to be violent toward our children, thereby devaluing them in society's eyes. It encourages children to resort to violence because they see their authority figures or substitute parents doing it [...] Violence is not acceptable and we must not support it by sanctioning its use by such authority figures as school officials".&lt;ref name=SAM2003/&gt;

==Alternatives==
The Society for Adolescent Medicine recommends developing "a milieu of effective communication, in which the teacher displays an attitude of respect for the students", as well as instruction that is stimulating and appropriate to student's abilities, various nonviolent behaviour modification techniques, and involving students and parents in making decisions about school matters such as rules and educational goals. They suggest that student self-governance can be an effective alternative for managing disruptive classroom behaviour, while stressing the importance of adequate training and support for teachers.&lt;ref name=SAM2003/&gt;

The AAP remarks that there has been "no reported increase in disciplinary problems in schools following the elimination of corporal punishment" according to evidence.&lt;ref name=Pediatricians/&gt;

==Student rights==
A number of international human-rights organizations including the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child|UN Committee on the Rights of the Child]], the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], and the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] have stated that physical punishment of any kind is a violation of children's human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/460bc7772.html |title= General comment No. 8 (2006): The right of the child to protection from corporal punishment and or cruel or degrading forms of punishment (articles 1, 28(2), and 37, inter alia) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2 March 2007 |publisher= United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, 42nd Sess., U.N.

According to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, "Children do not lose their human rights by virtue of passing through the school gates [...] the use of corporal punishment does not respect the inherent dignity of the child nor the strict limits on school discipline".&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child (2001). [https://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/crc/comment1.htm ''General Comment No. 1, The Aims of Education''.] U.N. Doc. CRC/GC/2001/1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee interprets Article 19 of the [[Convention on the rights of the child]], which obliges member states to "take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse […] while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child", to imply a prohibition on all forms of corporal punishment.

Other international human-rights bodies supporting prohibition of corporal punishment of children in all settings, including schools, include the [[European Committee of Social Rights]] and the [[African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child]]. In addition, the obligation of member states to prohibit corporal punishment in schools and elsewhere was affirmed in the 2009 Cairo Declaration on the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Islamic Jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=Report2015&gt;{{citation |title=Towards Non-violent Schools: Prohibiting All Corporal Punishment: Global Report 2015 |format=PDF |location=London |publisher=Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children; Save the Children |date=May 2015 |url=http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/assets/pdfs/reports-thematic/Schools%20Report%202015-EN.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children]], all forms of corporal punishment in schools are outlawed in 128 countries as of 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (46 of these countries also prohibited corporal punishment of children in the home as of May 2015).&lt;ref name=Report2015/&gt;

===Argentina===
Banned in 1813, corporal punishment was re-legalised in 1815 and punishments by physical pain lasted legally till 1884, when it was banned again unless there was a Court order. The instruments were [[rebenque]]s, [[Slapping (strike)|slapping]]s in the face and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/12/17/sociedad/s-06901.htm "Diálogo, premios y penitencias: cómo poner límites sin violencia"].

===Canada===
In ''[[Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada (Attorney General)|Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada]]'' (2004) the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] outlawed school corporal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/cas00402.htm#12652 "Supreme Court takes strap out of teachers' hands"]. ''Edmonton Journal'' (Alberta). 1 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In public schools, the usual implement was a rubber/canvas strap applied to the hands,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/cascr1.htm Moyers school supplies catalogue], 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; while private schools often used a paddle or cane administered to the student's posterior.&lt;ref&gt;FitzGerald, James (1994).[https://web.archive.org/web/20041010223331/http://www.pathcom.com/~jfitzg/oldboys_excerpts_ucc.htm ''Old Boys: The Powerful Legacy of Upper Canada College''].

====School Corporal Punishment Bans in Canadian Provinces====
In 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada outlawed corporal punishment in all schools, public or private. The practice itself had largely been abandoned in the 1970s when parents placed greater scrutiny on the treatment of children at school.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corpun.com/cad00502.htm#16725&lt;/ref&gt; The subject received extensive media coverage, and corporal punishment became obsolete as the practice was widely seen as degrading and inhumane. Despite the fact that the tradition had been forgone for nearly 30 years, legislation banning the practice entirely by law was not implemented until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://historyofrights.ca/encyclopaedia/main-events/corporal-punishment/&lt;/ref&gt;


Some Canadian provinces banned corporal punishment in public schools prior to the national ban in 2004. They are, in chronological order by year of provincial ban:{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===China===
Corporal punishment in China was officially banned after the communist revolution in 1949. The Compulsory Education Law of 1986 states: "It shall be forbidden to inflict physical punishment on students".&lt;ref name="Country report for China"/&gt; In practice, beatings by schoolteachers are common, especially in rural areas.&lt;ref name="corpun.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200507/31/eng20050731_199408.html "New measures taken in schools to improve teacher-student relations"], ''People's Daily'', Beijing, 31 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
A 1998 study found that random physical punishment (not proper formal corporal punishment) was being used extensively by teachers in [[Egypt]] to punish behavior they regarded as unacceptable. Around 80% of the boys and 60% of the girls were punished by teachers, using their hands, sticks, straps, shoes, punches and kicks as most common methods of administration. The most common reported [[injuries]] were bumps and [[contusions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Youssef RM, Attia MS, Kamel MI |title=Children experiencing violence.

===Germany===
School corporal punishment, historically widespread, was outlawed in different states via their administrative law at different times. It was not completely abolished everywhere until 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/desc8707.htm "It's 40 years since corporal punishment got a general boot"], translated from ''Saarbrücker Zeitung'', 19 June 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1993, use of corporal punishment by a teacher has been a criminal offence. In that year a sentence by the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] (''Bundesgerichtshof'', case number NStZ 1993.591) was published which overruled the previous powers enshrined in unofficial [[custom (law)|customary law]] (''Gewohnheitsrecht'') and upheld by some [[Oberlandesgericht|regional appeal courts]] (''Oberlandesgericht'', Superior State Court) even in the 1970s. They assumed a ''right of chastisement'' was a [[Justification (jurisprudence)|defense of justification]] against the accusation of "causing bodily harm" per ''Paragraph'' (=Section) ''223 [[Strafgesetzbuch]]'' (Federal Penal Code).

===Greece===
Corporal punishment in Greek primary schools was banned in 1998, and in secondary schools in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/greece.html Greece State Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908013303/http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/greece.html |date=8 September 2008 }}, GITEACPOC, November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===

''Time'' (New York).&lt;/ref&gt; A number of social and cultural groups, including [[Shankaracharya]], are campaigning against corporal punishment in India. In many states, corporal punishment is still practised within most schools. Society for Prevention of Injuries &amp; Corporal Punishment (SPIC) is actively running awareness campaigns to educate the teachers and students through conferences and scientific publications.&lt;ref&gt;http://forensicwayout.com/SPIC/tabid/127/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In the [[law of the Republic of Ireland]], corporal punishment was prohibited in 1982 by an administrative decision of [[John Boland (Fine Gael politician)|John Boland]], the [[Minister for Education and Skills|Minister for Education]], which applied to [[national school (Ireland)|national schools]] (most primary schools) and to secondary schools receiving public funding (practically all of them).&lt;ref&gt;

===Japan===
Although banned in 1947, corporal punishment is still commonly found in schools in the 2010s and particularly widespread in school sports clubs. In late 1987, about 60% of junior high school teachers felt it was necessary, with 7% believing it was necessary in all conditions, 59% believing it should be applied sometimes and 32% disapproving of it in all circumstances; while at elementary (primary) schools, 2% supported it unconditionally, 47% felt it was necessary and 49% disapproved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/jpsc8711.htm "Many Japanese Teachers Favor Corporal Punishment"], ''Nichi Bei Times'', San Francisco, 21 November 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; As recent as December 2012, a high school student committed suicide after having been constantly beaten by his basketball coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/student-commits-suicide-after-being-beaten-by-school-basketball-coach|title=Student commits suicide after being beaten by school basketball coach ' Japan Today: Japan News and Discussion|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An education ministry survey found that more than 10,000 students received illegal corporal punishment from more than 5,000 teachers across Japan in 2012 fiscal year alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/06/03/national/corporal-punishment-rife-in-schools-in-2012-survey/#.UjrOacZ6aQk|title=Corporal punishment rife in schools in 2012: survey|work=The Japan Times|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hand caning.jpg|thumb|right|160px|A picture showing the marks left on a Malaysian female student's palm after a caning]]
Caning is a common form of discipline in many Malaysian schools. Legally it should be applied only to male students, but the idea of making the caning of girls lawful has recently been debated. This would be applied to the palm of the hand, whereas boys are typically caned across the seat of the trousers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/counmy.htm#scp School corporal punishment in Malaysia] at World Corporal Punishment Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
Corporal punishment in New Zealand schools was abolished in 1987, but wasn't abolished legislatively until 23 July 1990, when Section 139A of the [[Education Act 1989]] was inserted by the Education Amendment Act 1990. Section 139A prohibits anyone employed by a school or ECE provider, or anyone supervising or controlling students on the school's behalf, from using force by way of correction or punishment towards any student at or in relation to the school or the student under their supervision or control.&lt;ref name="NZ legislation"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/contents.html |title= Education Act 1989 - New Zealand Legislation |publisher= New Zealand Parliamentary Counsel Office |accessdate = 9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers who administer corporal punishment can be found guilty of physical assault, resulting in [[termination of employment|termination]] and cancellation of teacher registration, and possibly criminal charges, with a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329725.html |title= §202C: Assault with weapon - Crimes Act 1961 No 43 as of 18 April 2012 - New Zealand Legislation |publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand) |date= 18 April 2012 |accessdate= 11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As enacted, the law had a loophole: parents, provided they were not school staff, could still discipline their children on school grounds. In early 2007, a southern Auckland Christian school was found to be using this loophole to discipline students by corporal punishment, by making the student's parents administer the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/content/994345/423466.html |title= School in corporal punishment spotlight |work = Television New Zealand |date=18 February 2007 |accessdate= 9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This loophole was closed in May 2007 by the [[Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007]], which enacted a blanket ban on parents administering corporal punishment to their children.

===Norway===
Corporal punishment in Norwegian schools was strongly restricted in 1889, and was prohibited outright in 1936.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Pakistan===
School corporal punishment in [[Pakistan]] is not very common in modern educational institutions although it is still used in schools across the rural parts of the country as a means of enforcing student discipline. The method has been criticised by some children's rights activists who claim that many cases of corporal punishment in schools have resulted in physical and mental abuse of schoolchildren. According to one report, corporal punishment is a key reason for school dropouts and subsequently, [[street children]], in Pakistan; as many as 35,000 high school pupils in Pakistan are said to drop out of the education system each year because they have been punished or abused in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=78275|title=PAKISTAN: Corporal punishment key reason for school dropouts|work=IRIN Asia|date=18 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke's work was highly influential, and may have helped influence Polish legislators to ban corporal punishment from Poland's schools in 1783. Today, the ban of corporal punishment in all forms is vested in [[Constitution of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Newell, Peter (ed.). ''A Last Resort?

Corporal punishment was banned in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] (and hence, Russian) schools in 1917.&lt;ref name="Teitelbaum1945"/&gt; In addition, the Article 336 (since 2006) of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation states that any teacher who has used corporal punishment on a pupil shall be dismissed.

===Serbia===
Corporal punishment was first explicitly prohibited in schools in article 67 of the Law on Public Schools 1929, passed in the Kingdom of  Yugoslavia, of which Serbia was then a part. Other now independent countries which belonged to Yugoslavia then and to which the 1929 Law applied are: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and Slovenia. In Serbia, corporal punishment in schools is now unlawful under the Law on Secondary Schools 1992, the Law on Elementary Schools 1992 and the Law on the Foundations of Education and Upbringing 2003/2009.&lt;ref&gt;Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children, Country Report for Serbia, updated February 2018, http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/progress/country-reports/serbia.html. &lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
The use of corporal punishment in schools was prohibited by the [[South African Schools Act, 1996]]. According to section 10 of the act:
{{quote|(1) No person may administer corporal punishment at a school to a learner.

(2) Any person who contravenes subsection (1) is guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a sentence which could be imposed for [[assault#South Africa|assault]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70921 South African Schools Act, 1996, Chapter 2: Learners, Section 10: Prohibition of corporal punishment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827233329/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70921 |date=27 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the case of ''[[Christian Education South Africa v Minister of Education]]'' the [[Constitutional Court (South Africa)|Constitutional Court]] rejected a claim that the constitutional right to religious freedom entitles private Christian schools to impose corporal punishment.

===South Korea===
Liberal regions in South Korea have completely banned all forms of caning beginning with [[Gyeonggi Province]] in 2010, followed by [[Seoul|Seoul Metropolitan City]], [[Gangwon Province, South Korea|Gangwon Province]], [[Gwangju Metropolitan City]] and [[North Jeolla Province]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0004972496&lt;/ref&gt; Other more conservative regions are governed by a national law enacted in 2011 which states that while caning is generally forbidden, it can be used indirectly to maintain school discipline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/schooling/469496.html 진보교육감들 “학생 간접체벌 불허”], 《한겨레》, 2011.3.23&lt;/ref&gt; It is still known to be practised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hankookilbo.com/m/v/1f2783bed47549688efc4b2f25e8d609 학교 체벌 일상화],''hankukilbo''south korea,2014.06.27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
Corporal punishment in Spanish schools was banned in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/spain.html Spain State Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103150421/http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/spain.html |date=3 November 2008 }}, GITEACPOC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
Corporal punishment at school has been prohibited in ''folkskolestadgan'' (the elementary school ordinance) since 1 January 1958. Its use by ordinary teachers in grammar schools had been outlawed in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aare.edu.au/97pap/johau029.htm | title = Changing concepts of Grammar School teacher authority in Sweden 1927-1965 | publisher = Australian Association for Research in Education | year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
In 2006 Taiwan made corporal punishment in the school system illegal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6215949.stm "Taiwan corporal punishment banned"], ''BBC News On Line'', London, 29 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is still known to be practised (see [[Corporal punishment in Taiwan]]).

===Tanzania===
In [[Tanzania]] corporal punishment in schools is widely practised and has lead to lasting damage including death of a punished pupil. The Education Act of 2002 authorizes the minister in charge of education to issue regulations concerning corporal punishment. The Education (Corporal Punishment) Regulation G.N. 294 of 2002 gives the authority to order corporal punishment to the headmaster of a school who can delegate to any teacher on case by case basis. The number of strikes must not be more than 4 for each occurrence, The school should have a register where date, reason, name of pupil and of administering teacher together with the number of strikes is to be recorded &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mwananchi.co.tz/habari/Makala/Ijue-sheria-ya-viboko-shuleni/1597592-4739596-loiigkz/index.html Ijue sheria ya viboko vya wanafunzi], Mwananchi newspaper 2 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Thailand===
Corporal punishment in schools is illegal under the Ministry of Education Regulation on Student Punishment (2005) and the National Committee on Child Protection Regulation on Working Procedures of Child Protection Officers Involved in Promoting Behaviour of Students (2005), pursuant to article 65 of the Child Protection Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/thailand.html#Lawfulness "Legality of corporal punishment in Thailand"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813011454/http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/thailand.html |date=13 August 2014 }}, ''End Corporal Punishment'',  February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thai proverb ''"If you love your cow, tie it up; if you love your child, beat him."'' is still considered "wisdom" and is held by many parents and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;https://seap.einaudi.cornell.edu/proverbs&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ukraine===
Corporal punishment was banned in Soviet (and hence, Ukrainian) schools in 1917.&lt;ref name="Teitelbaum1945"/&gt;
In Ukraine, "physical or mental violence" against children is forbidden by the Constitution (Art.52.2) and the Law on Education (Art.51.1, since 1991) which states that students and other learners have the right “to the protection from any form of exploitation, physical and psychological violence, actions of pedagogical and other employees who violate the rights or humiliate their honour and dignity”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/pdfs/states-reports/Ukraine.pdf Ukraine.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Punishment-record.jpg|thumb|Excerpt from a caning record of a British school (1970)]]
In state-run schools, and in private schools where at least part of the funding came from government, corporal punishment was outlawed by the [[British Parliament]] in 1986, following a 1982 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that such punishment could not be administered without parental consent, and that a child's "right to education" could not be infringed by suspending children who, with parental approval, refused to submit to corporal punishment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghandhi|first=Sandy|date=1984|title=Spare the Rod: Corporal Punishment in Schools and the European Convention on Human Rights|journal=The International and Comparative Law Quarterly|volume=33|issue=2|pages=488–494|jstor=759074}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/25/newsid_2516000/2516621.stm |title=On this day: 25 February. 1982: Parents can stop school beatings |work=BBC News |accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The implement used in many state and private schools in England and Wales was often a rattan [[caning|cane]], struck either across the student's hands or (especially in the case of teenage boys) the clothed [[buttocks]]. "[[Slippering]]"—striking the buttocks with a rubber-soled gym shoe, or [[plimsoll shoe]]—was widely used in many schools, for example King's School, Macclesfield, a boys grammar school in Cheshire.&lt;ref name=corpunkettering&gt;{{cite web |author=Kettering, David |url= http://www.corpun.com/kettering.htm |title=Behave or bend over for the slipper: UK Grammar School life in the 1960s |website= www.corpun.com |access-date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few English cities, a strap was used instead of the cane.&lt;ref name="stopp"&gt;''Guide to LEAs' Corporal Punishment Regulations in England and Wales'', Society of Teachers Opposed to Physical Punishment, Croydon, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland a leather strap, the [[tawse]], administered to the palms of the hands, was universal in state schools,&lt;ref&gt;"Rise and fall of the belt", ''Sunday Standard'', Glasgow, 28 February 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; but some private schools used the cane.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Kamal (27 April 2003). [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/apr/27/labour2001to2005.tonyblair3 "He could talk his way out of things"]. ''The Observer'' (London).&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the ban in private schools in England, the "slippering" of a student at an independent [[boarding school]] was challenged in 1993 before the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/private-schools-can-beat-pupils-european-court-of-human-rights-expresses-misgivings-on-corporal-1499897.html |title=Private schools 'can beat pupils': European Court of Human Rights expresses misgivings on corporal punishment |first=Adam |last=Sage |work=The Independent |date=26 March 1993 |accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court ruled 5–4 in that case that the punishment was not severe enough to infringe the student's "freedom from degrading punishment" under article 3 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The dissenting judges argued that the ritualised nature of the punishment, given after several days and without parental consent, should qualify it as "degrading punishment".&lt;ref name=Tan&gt;{{cite news |author= Ying Hui Tan |title=Law Report: 'Slippering' pupil is not degrading punishment: Costello-Roberts v The United Kingdom.

''[[R (Williamson) v Secretary of State for Education and Employment]]'' (2005) was an unsuccessful challenge to the prohibition of corporal punishment contained in the [[Education Act 1996]], by several [[headmaster]]s of private Christian schools who argued that it was a breach of their religious freedom.

In response to a 2008 poll of 6,162 UK teachers by the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'', 22% of secondary school teachers and 16% of primary school teachers supported "the right to use corporal punishment in extreme cases". The [[National Union of Teachers]] said that it "could not support the views expressed by those in favour of hitting children".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/7649308.stm "A 'fifth of teachers back caning'"].

===United States===
{{Main article|School corporal punishment in the United States}}
There is no federal law addressing corporal punishment in public or private schools. In 1977, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Ingraham v. Wright]]'' held that the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] clause prohibiting "cruel and unusual punishments" did not apply to school students, and that teachers could punish children without parental permission.

As of 2015, 31 states and the [[District of Columbia]] have banned corporal punishment in public schools, though in some of these there is no explicit prohibition. Corporal punishment is also unlawful in private schools in [[Iowa]] and [[New Jersey]]. In 19 U.S. states, corporal punishment is lawful in both public and private schools.&lt;ref name=USReport&gt;[http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/progress/country-reports/usa.html "Country report for USA"] (November 2015). 'Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children.&lt;/ref&gt; It is still common in some schools in the South, and more than 167,000 students were paddled in the 2011-2012 school year in American public schools.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/12/corporal-punishment/420420/|title=The States Where Teachers Can Still Spank Students|last=Anderson|first=Melinda D.|website=The Atlantic|language=English|access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can be physically punished from kindergarten to the end of high school, meaning that even legal [[Adult|adults]] who have reached the [[age of majority]] are sometimes spanked by school officials.&lt;ref name="corpun"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.corpun.com/counuss.htm |title= Corporal punishment in US schools |author= C. Farrell |date=October 2016 |website= www.corpun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  American legal scholars have argued that school paddling is unconstitutional and can cause lasting physical, emotional, and cognitive harm.&lt;ref&gt; See, e.g., Deana A. Pollard, Banning Corporal Punishment: A Constitutional Analysis, 52 Am. U. L. Rev. 447 (2002); Deana A. Pollard, Banning Child Corporal Punishment, 77 Tul. L. Rev. 575 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venezuela===
Corporal punishment in all settings, including schools, was prohibited in [[Venezuela]] in 2007. According to the Law for the Protection of Children and Adolescents, "All children and young people have a right to be treated well. This right includes a non-violent education and upbringing... Consequently, all forms of physical and humiliating punishment are prohibited".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/progress/prohibiting-states/venezuela.html "Prohibition of all corporal punishment in Venezuela (2007)"] Global Initiative to End All Corporal school Punishment of Children.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uganda===
In Uganda, teachers usually keep their huge classes calm by corporal punishment. However, there is some movement, who wants them to change disciplining methods by using positive discipline. Teachers should better teach them how to improve, when they performed badly&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/uganda-non-governmental-organisation-wants-convince-school-teachers-stopping-corporal "End pupils'fear of teachers' canes (2018)"] in D+C Vol. 45 05-06/2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, [[Name of Iran|Persia]] was always a cradle of science, contributing to medicine, [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]] and philosophy. Trying to revive the golden time of Persian science, Iran's scientists now are cautiously reaching out to the world. Many individual [[List of contemporary Iranian scientists |Iranian scientists]], along with the [[Iranian Academy of Medical Sciences]] and [[Academy of Sciences of Iran]], are involved in this revival.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Science in ancient Iran (Persia)==
{{See also|Islamic science|Inventions in medieval Islam|Timeline of Islamic science and technology|Academy of Gundishapur}}
Science in Persia evolved in two main phases separated by the arrival and widespread adoption of Islam in the region.

References to scientific subjects such as natural science and mathematics occur in books written in the [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian |Pahlavi]] languages.

===Ancient technology in Persia===
The [[Qanat]] (a water management system used for irrigation) originated in pre-[[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] Persia. The oldest and largest known qanat is in the Iranian city of [[Gonabad]], which, after 2,700&amp;nbsp;years, still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ward English |first= Paul |title= The Origin and Spread of Qanats in the Old World |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume= 112 |issue= 3 |pages= 170–181 |publisher=[[JSTOR]] |date= 21 June 1968 |jstor= 986162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persian philosophers and inventors may have created the first batteries (sometimes known as the [[Baghdad Battery]]) in the Parthian or Sassanid eras. Some have suggested that the batteries may have been used medicinally. Other scientists believe the batteries were used for electroplating—transferring a thin layer of metal to another metal surface—a technique still used today and the focus of a common classroom experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2804257.stm |work=BBC News |title=Riddle of 'Baghdad's batteries' |date= 27 February 2003 |accessdate= 23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windwheels were developed by the [[Babylonians]] ca. 1700&amp;nbsp;BC to pump water for irrigation. In the 7th&amp;nbsp;century, Persian engineers in [[Greater Iran]] developed a more advanced wind-power machine, the [[windmill]], building upon the basic model developed by the Babylonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psigate.ac.uk/newsite/physics_timeline.html |title=Intute: Science, Engineering and Technology |publisher= Psigate.ac.uk |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.geocities.com/ashishmsu/phytimeline.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091027150205/http://www.geocities.com/ashishmsu/phytimeline.htm |archivedate=2009-10-27 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher= Web.archive.org |date= 27 October 2009 |accessdate= 7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9th century mathematician [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Muhammad Ibn Musa-al-Kharazmi]] created the [[Logarithm]] table, developed algebra and expanded upon Persian and Indian arithmetic systems. His writings were translated into [[Latin]] by [[Gerard of Cremona]] under the title: ''De jebra et almucabola''. [[Robert of Chester]] also translated it under the title ''Liber algebras et almucabala''. The works of Kharazmi "exercised a profound influence on the development of mathematical thought in the medieval West".&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Donald. ''Islamic Science and Engineering''. 1993.

===Medicine===
{{Main article|Ancient Iranian Medicine}}
{{See also|Academy of Guneshapur|Bimarestan|Medicine in medieval Islam|Islamic medicine}}

The practice and study of medicine in Iran has a long and prolific history. Situated at the crossroads of the East and West, [[Persian Empire|Persia]] was often involved in developments in ancient Greek and Indian medicine; pre- and post-Islamic Iran have been involved in medicine as well.

For example, the first teaching hospital where medical students methodically practiced on patients under the supervision of physicians was the [[Academy of Gundishapur]] in the [[Persian Empire]]. Some experts go so far as to claim that: "to a very large extent, the credit for the whole hospital system must be given to Persia".&lt;ref&gt;C. Elgood. ''A Medical history of Persia''. Cambridge Univ. Press. p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Several documents still exist from which the definitions and treatments of the headache in medieval Persia can be ascertained. These documents give detailed and precise clinical information on the different types of headaches. The medieval physicians listed various signs and symptoms, apparent causes, and hygienic and dietary rules for prevention of headaches. The medieval writings are both accurate and vivid, and they provide long lists of substances used in the treatment of headaches. Many of the approaches of physicians in medieval Persia are accepted today; however, still more of them could be of use to modern medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gorji A, Khaleghi Ghadiri M |title= History of headache in medieval Persian medicine |journal=Lancet Neurology |volume=1 |issue=8 |pages=510–5 |date=December 2002  |pmid=12849336 |doi= 10.1016/S1474-4422(02)00226-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century work of [[Shahnameh]], [[Ferdowsi]] describes a [[Caesarean section]] performed on [[Rudabeh]], during which a special wine agent was prepared by a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] priest and used to produce unconsciousness for the operation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Granville Browne]]. ''Islamic Medicine'', Goodword Books, 2002, {{ISBN|81-87570-19-9}}. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Although largely mythical in content, the passage illustrates working knowledge of [[anesthesia]] in ancient [[Persia]].

Later in the 10th century, [[Al-Razi|Abu Bakr Muhammad Bin Zakaria Razi]] is considered the founder of practical physics and the inventor of the special or net weight of matter. His student, [[Abu Bakr Joveini]], wrote the first comprehensive medical book in the [[Persian language|Persian]] language.

After the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Islamic conquest of Iran]], medicine continued to flourish with the rise of notables such as [[Al-Razi|Rhazes]] and [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi|Haly Abbas]], albeit [[Baghdad]] was the new cosmopolitan inheritor of [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] Jundishapur's medical academy.

An idea of the number of medical works composed in Persian alone may be gathered from [[Adolf Fonahn]]'s ''Zur Quellenkunde der Persischen Medizin'', published in [[Leipzig]] in 1910. The author enumerates over 400 works in the Persian language on medicine, excluding authors such as [[Avicenna]], who wrote in Arabic. Author-historians Meyerhof, Casey Wood, and Hirschberg also have recorded the names of at least 80 [[Optometry|oculist]]s who contributed treatises on subjects related to [[ophthalmology]] from the beginning of 800&amp;nbsp;AD to the full flowering of Muslim medical literature in 1300&amp;nbsp;AD.

Aside from the aforementioned, two other medical works attracted great attention in medieval Europe, namely [[Al-Muwaffak|Abu Mansur Muwaffaq]]'s ''Materia Medica'', written around 950&amp;nbsp;AD, and the illustrated ''Anatomy'' of ''Mansur ibn Muhammad'', written in 1396&amp;nbsp;AD.

Modern academic medicine began in Iran when [[Joseph Cochran]] established a medical college in [[Urmia]] in 1878. Cochran is often credited for founding Iran's "first contemporary medical college".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.ac.ir/AIM/0252/0252127.htm |title=Archives Of Iranian Medicine |publisher=Ams.ac.ir |date=18 August 1905 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website of [[Urmia University]] credits Cochran for "lowering the infant mortality rate in the region"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urmia.ac.ir/intro.htm |title=Introduction to Urmia University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608120732/http://www.urmia.ac.ir/intro.htm |archivedate=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for founding one of Iran's first modern hospitals (Westminster Hospital) in Urmia.

[[File:Astrolabe-Persian-18C.jpg|250px|right|thumb|An 18th century Persian astrolabe]]
In 1000&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Biruni]] wrote an astronomical encyclopaedia that discussed the possibility that the earth might rotate around the sun. This was before [[Tycho Brahe]] drew the first maps of the sky, using stylized animals to depict the constellations.

In the tenth century, the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi cast his eyes upwards to the awning of stars overhead and was the first to record a galaxy outside our own. Gazing at the Andromeda galaxy he called it a "little cloud"{{snd}} an apt description of the slightly wispy appearance of our galactic neighbour.&lt;ref name=scotsman&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.scotsman.com/scitech.cfm?id=1634902007 |work=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh, UK | first=Claire | last=Gemson | title=1,001 inventions mark Islam's role in science | date=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tusi believed that a body of matter is able to change but is not able to disappear entirely. He wrote "a body of matter cannot disappear completely. It only changes its form, condition, composition, color, and other properties, and turns into a different complex or elementary matter". Five hundred years later, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] (1711–1765) and [[Antoine Lavoisier|Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier]] (1743–1794) created the law of [[conservation of mass]], setting down this same idea.&lt;ref name=azer92&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/92_folder/92_articles/92_tusi.html |title=9.2 A 13th-Century Darwin? – Tusi's Views on Evolution – Farid Alakbarov |publisher=Azer.com |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it should be noted that Tusi argued for evolution within a firmly Islamic context—he did not, like Darwin, draw materialist conclusions from his theories. Moreover, unlike Darwin, he was arguing hypothetically: he did not attempt to provide empirical data for his theories. Nonetheless his arguments, which in some ways prefigure [[natural selection]], are still considered remarkably 'advanced' for their time.

[[Jābir ibn Hayyān|Jaber Ibn Hayyan]], the famous Iranian chemist who died in 804 at Tous in [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], was the father of a number of discoveries recorded in an encyclopaedia and of many treatises covering two thousand topics, and these became the bible of European chemists of the 18th century, particularly of Lavoisier. These works had a variety of uses including tinctures and their applications in tanning and textiles; distillations of plants and flowers; the origin of perfumes; therapeutic pharmacy, and gunpowder, a powerful military instrument possessed by Islam long before the West. Jabir ibn Hayyan, is widely regarded as the founder of chemistry, inventing many of the basic processes and equipment still used by chemists today such as [[distillation]].&lt;ref name=scotsman/&gt;

===Physics===

[[File:Kamal-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kamal al-Din al-Farisi]]'s autograph manuscript in Optics, Tanqih al-Manazir, 1309 A.D., Adilnor Collection.]]

[[Biruni]] was the first scientist to formally propose that the [[speed of light]] is finite, before [[Galileo]] tried to experimentally prove this.

[[Kamal al-Din Al-Farisi]] (1267–1318) born in [[Tabriz]], Iran, is known for giving the first mathematically satisfactory explanation of the rainbow, and an explication of the nature of colours that reformed the theory of Ibn al-Haytham. Al-Farisi also "proposed a model where the ray of light from the sun was refracted twice by a water droplet, one or more reflections occurring between the two refractions."{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} He verified this through extensive experimentation using a transparent sphere filled with water and a [[camera obscura]].

== Science policy ==
{{see also|Higher education in Iran|List of Iranian Research Centers|List of countries by research and development spending}}The [[Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology]] and the [[National Research Institute for Science Policy]] come under the [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology]]. They are in charge of establishing national research policies.

The government first set its sights on moving from a resource-based economy to one based on knowledge in its 20-year development plan, ''Vision 2025'', adopted in 2005. This transition became a priority after international sanctions were progressively hardened from 2006 onwards and the oil embargo tightened its grip. In February 2014, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei introduced what he called the ‘[[resistive economy|economy of resistance]]’, an economic plan advocating innovation and a lesser dependence on imports that reasserted key provisions of ''Vision 2025''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Iran. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Ashtarian|first=Kioomars|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=389–407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vision 2025'' challenged policy-makers to look beyond extractive industries to the country’s human capital for wealth creation. This led to the adoption of incentive measures to raise the number of university students and academics, on the one hand, and to stimulate problem-solving and industrial research, on the other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Iran's successive five-year plans aim to realize collectively the goals of ''Vision 2025''. For instance, in order to ensure that 50% of academic research was oriented towards socio-economic needs and problem-solving, the ''[[economy of Iran#National economic planning|Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan]]'' (2010–2015) tied promotion to the orientation of research projects. It also made provision for research and technology centres to be set up on campus and for universities to develop linkages with industry.  The ''Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan'' had two main thrusts relative to science policy. The first was the "islamization of universities', a notion that is open to broad interpretation. According to Article 15 of the ''Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan'', university programmes in the humanities were to teach the virtues of critical thinking, theorization and multidisciplinary studies. A number of research centres were also to be developed in the humanities. The plan's second thrust was to make Iran the second-biggest player in science and technology by 2015, behind Turkey. To this end, the government pledged to raise domestic research spending to 3% of GDP by 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Yet, [[Science in Iran#Budget|R&amp;D’s share in the GNP]] is at 0.06% in 2015 (where it should be at least 2.5% of GDP)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper|title=Memorandum of the foreign trade regime of Iran|publisher=[[Ministry of Commerce (Iran)|Ministry of Commerce]]|date=November 2009|url=http://www.irantradelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Irans-Foreign-Trade-Regime-Report.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713054415/http://www.irantradelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Irans-Foreign-Trade-Regime-Report.pdf|archivedate=13 July 2011|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=248319|work=Tehran Times|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Science in Iran#Private sector|industry-driven R&amp;D]] is almost non‑existent.&lt;ref name=article2&gt;{{cite news| title= Iran's Neoliberal Austerity-Security Budget | work = [[Hooshang Amirahmadi]] | url= http://www.payvand.com/news/15/feb/1076.html| accessdate= February 21, 2015| date=February 16, 2015| publisher= Payvand.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vision 2025'' fixed a number of targets, including that of raising domestic expenditure on research and development to 4% of GDP by 2025. In 2012, spending stood at 0.33% of GDP.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2009, the government adopted a ''National Master Plan for Science and Education'' to 2025 which reiterates the goals of Vision 2025. It lays particular stress on developing university research and fostering university–industry ties to promote the commercialization of research results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/Influencing_Policy/Reports/2011-03-28-Knowledge-networks-nations.pdf|title=- Royal Society|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="universityworldnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110330082828206|title=GLOBAL: Strong science in Iran, Tunisia, Turkey|publisher=University World News|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20090827175231370|title=IRAN: 20-year plan for knowledge-based economy|publisher=University World News|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5iB6Zh7nT6ZGhwZrKK7xTUgiE_Hig?docId=N0263521301316235753A|title=China marching ahead in science|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401112927/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5iB6Zh7nT6ZGhwZrKK7xTUgiE_Hig?docId=N0263521301316235753A|archivedate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42313412/ns/technology_and_science-science/|title=China leads challenge to 'scientific superpowers' - Technology &amp; science - Science|date=28 March 2011|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human resources ===
{{See also|Economy of Iran#Labor force|Iran's brain drain}}
In line with the goals of ''Vision 2025'', policy-makers have made a concerted effort to increase the number of students and academic researchers. To this end, the government raised its commitment to higher education to 1% of GDP in 2006. After peaking at this level, higher education spending stood at 0.86% of GDP in 2015. [[Higher education in Iran|Higher education]] spending has resisted better than public expenditure on education overall. The latter peaked at 4.7% of GDP in 2007 before slipping to 2.9% of GDP in 2015. ''Vision 2025'' fixed a target of raising public expenditure on education to 7% of GDP by 2025.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Student enrollment trends ====
{{See also|Women in Iran}}
[[File:Students enrolled in Iranian universities, 2007 and 2013.svg|thumb|Students enrolled in Iranian universities, 2007 and 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015)]]
The result of greater spending on higher education has been a steep rise in tertiary enrollment. Between 2007 and 2013, student rolls swelled from 2.8 million to 4.4 million in the country’s public and private universities. Some 45% of students were enrolled in private universities in 2011. There were more women studying than men in 2007, a proportion that has since dropped back slightly to 48%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Enrollment has progressed in most fields. The most popular in 2013 were social sciences (1.9 million students, of which 1.1 million women) and engineering (1.5 million, of which 373 415 women). Women also made up two-thirds of medical students. One in eight bachelor’s students go on to enroll in a master’s/PhD programme. This is comparable to the ratio in the Republic of Korea and Thailand (one in seven) and Japan (one in ten).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The number of PhD graduates has progressed at a similar pace as university enrollment overall. Natural sciences and engineering have proved increasingly popular among both sexes, even if engineering remains a male-dominated field. In 2012, women made up one-third of PhD graduates, being drawn primarily to health (40% of PhD students), natural sciences (39%), agriculture (33%) and humanities and arts (31%). According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 38% of master’s and PhD students were studying science and engineering fields in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:PhD graduates in Iran by field of study and gender, 2007 and 2012.svg|thumb|PhD graduates in Iran by field of study and gender, 2007 and 2012. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015)]]
There has been an interesting evolution in the gender balance among PhD students. Whereas the share of female PhD graduates in health remained stable at 38–39% between 2007 and 2012, it rose in all three other broad fields. Most spectacular was the leap in female PhD graduates in agricultural sciences from 4% to 33% but there was also a marked progression in science (from 28% to 39%) and engineering (from 8% to 16% of PhD students). Although data are not readily available on the number of PhD graduates choosing to stay on as faculty, the relatively modest level of domestic research spending would suggest that academic research suffers from inadequate funding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The ''Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan'' (2010–2015) fixed the target of attracting 25 000 foreign students to Iran by 2015. By 2013, there were about 14 000 foreign students attending Iranian universities, most of whom came from Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria and Turkey. In a speech delivered at the University of Tehran in October 2014, [[President Rouhani]] recommended greater interaction with the outside world. He said that ‘scientific evolution will be achieved by criticism […] and the expression of different ideas. […] Scientific progress is achieved, if we are related to the world. […] We have to have a relationship with the world, not only in foreign policy but also with regard to the economy, science and technology. […] I think it is necessary to invite foreign professors to come to Iran and our professors to go abroad and even to create an English university to be able to attract foreign students.’&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One in four Iranian PhD students were studying abroad in 2012 (25.7%). The top destinations were Malaysia, the USA, Canada, Australia, UK, France, Sweden and Italy. In 2012, one in seven international students in Malaysia was of Iranian origin. There is a lot of scope for the development of twinning between universities for teaching and research, as well as for student exchanges.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Trends in researchers ====
According to the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]], the number of (full-time equivalent) researchers rose from 711 to 736 per million inhabitants between 2009 and 2010. This corresponds to an increase of more than 2 000 researchers, from 52 256 to 54 813. The world average is 1 083 per million inhabitants. One in four (26%) [[Women in Iran|Iranian researchers is a woman]], which is close to the world average (28%). In 2008, half of researchers were employed in academia (51.5%), one-third in the government sector (33.6%) and just under one in seven in the business sector (15.0%). Within the business sector, 22% of researchers were women in 2013, the same proportion as in Ireland, Israel, Italy and Norway. The number of firms declaring research activities more than doubled between 2006 and 2011, from 30 935 to 64 642. The increasingly tough sanctions regime oriented the [[economy of Iran|Iranian economy]] towards the domestic market and, by erecting barriers to foreign imports, encouraged knowledge-based enterprises to localize production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Research expenditure===
{{See also|Politics of Iran#Budget|l1=Public budget in Iran}}

Iran's national science budget was about $900&amp;nbsp;million in 2005 and it had not been subject to any significant increase for the previous 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Islamic Science Revolution?|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/309/5742/1802?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=iran&amp;searchid=1138556046976_3291&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;journalcode=sci|journal=Science|volume=309|pages=1802–1804|doi=10.1126/science.309.5742.1802|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Iran devoted 0.50% of GDP to research and development. Expenditure peaked at 0.67% of GDP in 2008 before receding to 0.33% of GDP in 2012, according to the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/?queryid=74|title=GERD/GDP ratio in Iran|last=|first=|date=6 June 2017|website=UNESCO Institute for Statistics|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world average in 2013 was 1.7% of GDP.

Iranian businesses contributed about 11% of the total in 2008. The government’s limited budget is being directed towards supporting small innovative businesses, business incubators and science and technology parks, the type of enterprises which employ university graduates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The share of private businesses in total national R&amp;D funding according to the same report is very low, being just 14%, as compared with [[Turkey]]'s 48%.

==== Funding the transition to a knowledge economy ====
{{See also|Foreign direct investment in Iran|Economy of Iran}}
[[File:Scientific publication trends in Iran, 2005–2014, Strong growth in Iranian publications.svg|thumb|Trends in Iranian scientific publications, 2005–2014. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015)]]
''Vision 2025'' foresaw an investment of US$3.7 trillion by 2025 to finance the transition to a knowledge economy. It was intended for one-third of this amount to come from abroad but, so far, FDI has remained elusive. It has contributed less than 1% of GDP since 2006 and just 0.5% of GDP in 2014. Within the country’s ''Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan'' (2010–2015), a [[National Development Fund]] has been established to finance efforts to diversify the economy. By 2013, the fund was receiving 26% of oil and gas revenue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Much of the US$3.7 trillion earmarked in ''Vision 2025'' is to go towards supporting investment in research and development by knowledge-based firms and the commercialization of research results. A law passed in 2010 provides an appropriate mechanism, the Innovation and Prosperity Fund. According to the fund’s president, Behzad Soltani, 4600 billion Iranian rials (circa US$171.4 million) had been allocated to 100 knowledge-based companies by late 2014. Public and private universities wishing to set up private firms may also apply to the fund.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some 37 industries trade shares on the [[Tehran Stock Exchange]]. These industries include the petrochemical, automotive, mining, steel, iron, copper, agriculture and telecommunications industries, ‘a unique situation in the Middle East’. Most of the companies developing high technologies remain state-owned, including in the automotive and pharmaceutical industries, despite plans to privatize 80% of state-owned companies by 2014. It was estimated in 2014 that the private sector accounted for about 30% of the [[pharmaceuticals in Iran|Iranian pharmaceutical market]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Iranians now publish most in engineering, followed by chemistry.svg|thumb|Iranian publications by field of science, 2008-2014.

IDRO has set up special purpose companies in each high-tech sector to coordinate investment and business development. These entities are the Life Science Development Company, Information Technology Development Centre, Iran InfoTech Development Company and the Emad Semiconductor Company. In 2010, IDRO set up a capital fund to finance the intermediary stages of product- and technology-based business development within these companies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Innovation==
{{see also|Intellectual property in Iran|Banking in Iran#Venture capital|l2=Venture capital in Iran}}
[[File:Index of economic complexity - Iran.svg|thumb|[[Economic complexity index]] for Iran (1964-2014).]]
As of 2004, Iran's [[national innovation system]] (NIS) had not experienced a serious entrance to the technology creation phase and mainly exploited the technologies developed by other countries (e.g. [[National Petrochemical Company#Research and development|in the petrochemicals industry]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4777997_A_National_System_of_Innovation_in_the_Making__An_Analysis_of_the_Role_of_Government_with_Respect_to_Promoting_Domestic_Innovations_in_the_Manufacturing_Sector_of_Iran|title=A National System of Innovation in the Making : An Analysis of the Role of Government with Respect to Promoting Domestic Innovations in the Manufacturing Sector of Iran|work=ResearchGate|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Iran ranked second in the percentage of graduates in science and engineering in the [[Global Innovation Index]]. Iran also ranked fourth in [[Higher education in Iran|tertiary education]], 26 in knowledge creation, 31 in gross percentage of tertiary enrollment, 41 in general infrastructure, 48 in human capital as well as research and 51 in innovation efficiency ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.mehrnews.com/news/119205/Iran-ranked-2nd-in-percentage-of-science-engineering-graduates |title=Iran ranked 2nd in percentage of science, engineering graduates|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years several [[Pharmaceuticals in Iran|drugmakers in Iran]] are gradually developing the ability to innovate, away from [[generic drugs]] production itself.&lt;ref name="companiesandmarket"&gt;{{cite web|author=Greg Palast |url=http://www.officialwire.com/main.php?action=posted_news&amp;rid=107645&amp;catid=1015 |title=Pharmaceuticals: Afghan Ufficiale: La NATO Airstrike Uccide 14 |publisher=OfficialWire |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Intellectual property in Iran#Agencies responsible for IP policy in Iran|State Registration Organization of Deeds and Properties]]'', a total of 9,570 national [[invention]]s was registered in Iran during 2008. Compared with the previous year, there was a 38-percent increase in the number of inventions registered by the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1388/3372/html/science.htm |title=Iran Registered 9,000 Inventions Last Year |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415053429/http://www.iran-daily.com/1388/3372/html/science.htm |archivedate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran has several funds to support entrepreneurship and innovation:&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150915104200/http://www.cgiran.org/main/images/files/20140429102612_IranEntrepreneurshipEcosystemReport-IEA2013-v2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samand LX Kermanshah.jpg|thumbnail|[[IKCO]]'s Samand LX]]

[[Economy of Iran#National economic planning|The 5th Development Plan]] (2010–15) requires the private sector to communicate research needs to [[Higher education in Iran|universities]] so that universities would coordinate research projects in line with these needs, with sharing of expenses by both sides.&lt;ref name="en.mehrnews.com"&gt;http://en.mehrnews.com/detail/News/103374&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its weakness or absence, the support industry makes little contribution to the innovation/technology development activities. Supporting the development of [[Industry of Iran#Small and medium enterprises|small and medium enterprises in Iran]] will strengthen greatly the [[supply chain|supplier network]].&lt;ref name="unctad.org" /&gt;

As of 2014, Iran had 930 industrial parks and zones, of which 731 are ready to be [[Privatization in Iran|ceded to the private sector]].&lt;ref&gt;http://iran-daily.com/newspaper/page/4835/4/14035/0&lt;/ref&gt; The [[government of Iran]] has plans for the establishment of 50–60 new [[industrial park]]s by the end of the fifth [[Economy of Iran#National economic planning|Five-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan]] (2015).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mehrnews.com/en/NewsDetail.aspxNewsID=509073?] retrieved 12 February 2008 {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003-report by the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] regarding small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/user_media/Publications/Pub_free/Strategy_document_to_enhance_contribution_of_efficient_and_competitive_SME_sector%20_in_Iran.pdf ''Iran's Small and Medium Enterprises'']. The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (2003). Retrieved 2 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; identified the following impediments to industrial development:

*Lack of monitoring institutions;
*Inefficient [[Banking in Iran|banking system]];
*Insufficient [[Science in Iran#Science in modern Iran|research &amp; development]];
*Shortage of managerial skills;
*[[Corruption in Iran|Corruption]];
*[[Taxation in Iran|Inefficient taxation]];
*Socio-cultural apprehensions;
*Absence of social learning loops;
*Shortcomings in international market awareness necessary for [[Global Competitiveness Report|global competition]],
*Cumbersome bureaucratic procedures;
*Shortage of skilled labor;
*Lack of [[Intellectual property in Iran|intellectual property protection]];
*Inadequate social capital, social responsibility and [[Culture of Iran|socio-cultural values]].

The [[economic complexity index|economic complexity]] ranking of Iran has increased by 1 places over the past 50 years from 66th in 1964 to 65th in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/irn/&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[UNCTAD]] in 2016, private companies in Iran need better [[marketing]] strategies with emphasis on [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://presstv.com/Detail/2016/12/07/496812/Iran-science-technology-development-innovation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unctad"/&gt;

Despite these problems, Iran has progressed in various scientific and technological fields, including [[National Iranian Petrochemical Company|petrochemical]], [[Healthcare in Iran#Pharmaceuticals|pharmaceutical]], [[Iranian Space Agency|aerospace]], [[List of military equipment manufactured in Iran|defense]], and [[Industry of Iran|heavy industry]]. Even in the face of [[sanctions against Iran|economic sanctions]], Iran is emerging as an [[industrialized country]].&lt;ref&gt;Torbat, Akbar (2010): [http://www.ecosecretariat.org/ftproot/Publications/Journal/2/jurnal2.htm Industrialization and Dependency: the Case of Iran].

Parallel to academic research, several companies have been founded in Iran during last few decades. For example, [[CinnaGen]], established in 1992, is one of the pioneering biotechnology companies in the region. [[CinnaGen]] won ''Biotechnology Asia 2005 Innovation Awards'' due to its achievements and innovation in biotechnology research. In 2006, [[Parsé Semiconductor Co.]] announced it had designed and produced a 32-bit computer [[microprocessor]] inside the country for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/news/design/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=191203237 |title=Iran develops 32-bit processor |publisher=Eetimes.com |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Communications in Iran#Software development|Software companies]] are growing rapidly.

Iranian [[Biophysics|biophysicists]], especially molecular biophysicists, have gained international reputations since the 1990s{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. High field [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] facility, micro[[calorimetry]], [[circular dichroism]], and instruments for single protein channel studies have been provided in Iran during the past two decades. [[Tissue engineering]] and research on [[biomaterial]]s have just started to emerge in biophysics departments.

Considering the country's [[Iran's brain drain|brain drain]] and its poor political [[Iran-United States relations|relationship with the United States]] and some other Western countries, Iran's scientific community remains productive, even while [[sanctions against Iran|economic sanctions]] make it difficult for universities to buy equipment or to send people to the United States to attend scientific meetings.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt; Furthermore, Iran considers scientific backwardness, as one of the root causes of political and military bullying by developed countries over developing states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www5.irna.ir/En/View/FullStory/?NewsId=392352&amp;IdLanguage=3]{{dead link|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/156629.html|title='Arrogant powers fear Iran's progress'|date=22 December 2010|publisher=PressTV|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Iranian Revolution]], there have been efforts by the religious scholars to assimilate Islam with modern science and this is seen by some as the reason behind the recent successes of Iran to augment its scientific output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/199119|title=Quarks and the Koran: Iran's Islamic Embrace of Science – The Daily Beast|date=22 May 2009|work=Newsweek|author=Maziar Bahari|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently Iran aims for a national goal of self-sustainment in all scientific arenas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12185&amp;page=61|title=Science and Technology and the Future Development of Societies: International Workshop Proceedings|date=23 January 2001|publisher=Nap.edu|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12185&amp;page=24|title=Science and Technology and the Future Development of Societies: International Workshop Proceedings|date=11 February 2007|publisher=Nap.edu|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many individual [[List of contemporary Iranian scientists|Iranian scientists]], along with the [[Iranian Academy of Medical Sciences]] and [[Academy of Sciences of Iran]], are involved in this revival.

Modern organ transplantation in Iran dates to 1935, when the first cornea transplant in Iran was performed by Professor [[Mohammad-Qoli Shams]] at Farabi Eye Hospital in Tehran, Iran. The [[Shiraz]] Nemazi transplant center, also one of the pioneering transplant units of Iran, performed the first Iranian [[kidney]] transplant in 1967 and the first Iranian [[liver]] transplant in 1995. The first heart transplant in Iran was performed in 1993 in Tabriz.

Agricultural research has been successful in releasing high-yielding varieties with higher stability as well as tolerance to harsh weather conditions. The agriculture researchers are working jointly with international Institutes to find the best procedures and genotypes to overcome produce failure and to increase yield. In 2005, Iran's first [[Genetically modified organism |genetically modified]] (GM) rice was approved by national authorities and is being grown commercially for human consumption. In addition to GM rice, Iran has produced several GM plants in the laboratory, such as insect-resistant maize; cotton; potatoes and sugar beets; herbicide-resistant canola; salinity- and drought-tolerant wheat; and blight-resistant maize and wheat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlypunjab.com/fullstory2k5-insight--status-7-newsID-12171.html Iranian scientists produce GM rice: Middle East Onlypunjab.com- Onlypunjab.com Latest News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royan Institute]] engineered Iran's first [[cloning|cloned animal]]; the sheep was born on 2 August 2006 and passed the critical first two months of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/science/story/2006/08/060805_mf_clone.shtml |title= BBCPersian.com |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=17674 |title=Middle East Online |publisher=Middle East Online |date=30 September 2006 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trends in nanotechnology in Iran, Iran is now ranked seventh worldwide for the number of nanotech-related papers.svg|thumb|Number of Iranian articles on nanotechnology in 2014. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015)]]
Research in nanotechnology has taken off in Iran since the Nanotechnology Initiative Council (NIC) was founded in 2002. The council determines the general policies for the development of nanotechnology and co-ordinates their implementation. It provides facilities, creates markets and helps the private sector to develop relevant R&amp;D activities. In the past decade, 143 nanotech companies have been established in eight industries. More than one-quarter of these are found in the health care industry, compared to just  3% in the automotive industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Today, five research centres specialize in nanotechnology, including the Nanotechnology Research Centre at Sharif University, which established Iran’s first doctoral programme in nanoscience and nanotechnology a decade ago. Iran also hosts the International Centre on Nanotechnology for Water Purification, established in collaboration with UNIDO in 2012. In 2008, NIC established an Econano network to promote the scientific and industrial development of nanotechnology among fellow members of the Economic Cooperation Organization, namely Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Trends in nanotechnology in Iran, The 143 Iranian nanotech companies are active in eight industries.svg|thumb|Industries in which Iranian nanotech companies are active. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030]]

Iran recorded strong growth in the number of articles on nanotechnology between 2009 and 2013, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science. By 2013, Iran ranked seventh for this indicator. The number of articles per million population has tripled to 59, overtaking Japan in the process. Few patents are being granted to Iranian inventors in nanotechnology, as yet, however. The ratio of nanotechnology patents to articles was 0.41 per 100 articles for Iran in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Scientific collaboration==
{{See also|Foreign relations of Iran|Iran's brain drain|Iranian citizens abroad}}

Iran annually hosts international science festivals. The ''International Kharazmi Festival in Basic Science'' and The ''Annual Razi Medical Sciences Research Festival'' promote original research in science, technology, and medicine in Iran. There is also an ongoing [[R&amp;D]] collaboration between [[List of Iranian companies|large state-owned companies]] and the [[List of Iranian Universities|universities in Iran]].

Iranians welcome scientists from all over the world to Iran for a visit and participation in seminars or collaborations. Many Nobel laureates and influential scientists such as [[Bruce Alberts]], [[Frank Sherwood Rowland|F. Sherwood Rowland]], [[Kurt Wüthrich]], [[Stephen Hawking]], and [[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes]] visited Iran after the Iranian revolution. Some universities also hosted American and European scientists as guest lecturers during recent decades.

Although sanctions have caused a shift in Iran’s trading partners from West to East, scientific collaboration has remained largely oriented towards the West. Between 2008 and 2014, Iran’s top partners for scientific collaboration were the USA, Canada, the UK and Germany, in that order. Iranian scientists co-authored almost twice as many articles with their counterparts in the USA (6 377) as with their next-closest collaborators in Canada (3 433) and the UK (3 318).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Iranian and U.S. scientists have collaborated on a number of projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jillson|first=Irene|date=2013-03-18|title=The United States and Iran|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2013/united-states-and-iran|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysia is Iran’s fifth-closest collaborator in science and India ranks tenth, after Australia, France, Italy and Japan. One-quarter of Iranian articles had a foreign co-author in 2014, a stable proportion since 2002. Scientists have been encouraged to publish in international journals in recent years, a policy that is in line with ''Vision 2025''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The volume of scientific articles authored by Iranians in international journals has augmented considerably since 2005, according to Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). Iranian scientists now publish widely in international journals in engineering and chemistry, as well as in life sciences and physics. Women contribute about 13% of articles, with a focus on chemistry, medical sciences and social sciences. Contributing to this trend is the fact that PhD programmes in Iran now require students to have publications in the Web of Science.

Iran has submitted a formal request to participate in a project which is building an [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]] (ITER) in France by 2018. This megaproject is developing nuclear fusion technology to lay the groundwork for tomorrow’s nuclear fusion power plants. The project involves the European Union, China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation and USA. A team from ITER visited Iran in November 2016 to deepen its understanding of Iran’s fusion-related programmes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/12/jul/1199.html|title=Iran joins research team for nuclear fusion project|publisher=Payvand.com|accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran hosts several international research centres, including the following established between 2010 and 2014 under the auspices of the [[United Nations]]: the [[Regional Center for Science Park and Technology Incubator Development]] ([[UNESCO]], est. 2010), the [[International Center on Nanotechnology]] ([[UNIDO]], est. 2012) and the [[Regional Educational and Research Center for Oceanography for Western Asia]] (UNESCO, est. 2014).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Iran is stepping up its scientific collaboration with developing countries. In 2008, Iran’s Nanotechnology Initiative Council established an Econano network to promote the scientific and industrial development of nanotechnology among fellow members of the Economic Cooperation Organization, namely Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The Regional Centre for Science Park and Technology Incubator Development is also initially targeting these same countries. It is offering them policy advice on how to develop their own science parks and technology incubators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Iran is an active member of [[COMSTECH]] and collaborates on its international projects. The coordinator general of COMSTECH, Dr. [[Atta ur Rahman (scientist)|Atta ur Rahman]] has said that Iran is the leader in science and technology among Muslim countries and hoped for greater cooperation with Iran in different international technological and industrialization projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8903261625|title=Fars News Agency:: OIC Official Hails Iran's Leading Role in Science, Technology|date=16 June 2010|publisher=English.farsnews.com|accessdate=21 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301004635/http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8903261625|archivedate=1 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian scientists are also helping to construct the Compact Muon Solenoid, a detector for the Large Hadron Collider of the European Organization for Nuclear Research ([[CERN]]) that is due to come online in 2008{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}.

The then technologically superior Iraq and its use of [[chemical weapons]] on Iranians, made Iran to embark on a very ambitious science developing program by mobilizing scientists in order to offset its [[international isolation]], and this is most evident in the country's nuclear sciences advancement, which has in the past two decades grown by 8,400% as compared to the 34% for the rest of the world. This report further predicts that though Iran's scientific advancement as a response to its international isolation may remain a cause of concern for the world, all the while it may lead to a higher [[quality of life]] for the Iranian population but simultaneously and paradoxically will also isolate Iran even more because of the world's concern over Iran's technological advancements. Other findings of the report point out that the fastest growing sectors in Iran are Physics, Public health sciences, Engineering, Chemistry and Mathematics. Overall the growth has mostly occurred after 1980 and specially has been becoming faster since 1991 with a significant acceleration in 2002 and an explosive surge since 2005.&lt;ref name="Iran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="science-metrix.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-02/s-www021610.php |title=Wall, war, wealth: 30 years in science |publisher=Eurekalert.org |date=17 February 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18546-iran-showing-fastest-scientific-growth-of-any-country.html |title=Iran showing fastest scientific growth of any country – science-in-society – 18 February 2010 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/j3w865q255vgr260/ |title=Scientometrics, Volume 62, Number 2 |publisher=SpringerLink |accessdate=21 October 2011 |doi=10.1007/s11192-005-0017-5 |volume=62 |journal=Scientometrics |pages=239–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that scientific and technological advancement besides [[Nuclear program of Iran|the nuclear program]] is the main reason for United States worry about Iran, which may become a superpower in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aljazeera.com/news/articles/41/Just_like_China_Iran_is_emerging_as_a_super_po.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405095703/http://aljazeera.com/news/articles/41/Just_like_China_Iran_is_emerging_as_a_super_po.html |archivedate=5 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Soroor Ahmed |url=http://www.radianceweekly.com/203/5361/cut-motion-saw-trivialisation-of-politics/2010-05-09/science/story-detail/iran-turkey-break-scientific-monopolyhas-islam-anything-to-do-with-it.html |title=Iran, Turkey Break Scientific Monopoly Has Islam Anything to Do With It? |publisher=Radianceweekly.com |date=2010-05-09 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/israeli-study-exposes-fallacy-of-iran-threat-2140 |title=Israeli study exposes fallacy of Iran threat |publisher=Geopolitical Monitor |date=12 May 2009 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314054457/http://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/israeli-study-exposes-fallacy-of-iran-threat-2140 |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some in Iranian scientific community see sanctions as a western conspiracy to stop Iran's rising rank in modern science and allege that some (western) countries want to monopolize modern technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Maziar Bahari |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/199119/page/2 |title=Quarks and the Koran: Iran's Islamic Embrace of Science – The Daily Beast |work=Newsweek |date=22 May 2009 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527092256/http://www.newsweek.com/id/199119/page/2 |archivedate=27 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A [[Bibliometrics|bibliometric]] analysis of [[Western Asia|middle east]] was released by professional division of [[Thomson Reuters#Operations|Thomson Reuters]] in 2011 titled "Global Research Report Middle East" comparing scientific research in middle eastern countries with that of the world for the first decade of this century. The study findings rank Iran at second position after Turkey in terms of total scientific output with Turkey producing 1.9% of the world's total science output while Iran's share of world's total science output was at 1.3%. Total scientific output of 14 countries surveyed including Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Yemen was just 4% of the world's total output; with Turkey and Iran producing the bulk of scientific research in the region. In terms of growth in scientific research, Iran was ranked first with 650% increase of its share in world's output and Turkey second with a growth of 270%. Turkey increased its research publication rate from 5000 papers in year 2000 to nearly 22000 in the year 2009, while Iran's research publication started from a lower point of 1300 papers in year 2000 and grew to 15000 papers in the year 2009 with a notable surge in Iranian growth after year 2004. In terms of production of highly [[Citation|cited]] papers, 1.7% of all Iranian papers in mathematics and 1.3% of papers in engineering fields attained highly cited status defined as most cited top 1% of world's publications, exceeding the world's average in [[Impact factor|citation impact]] for those fields. Overall Iran produces 0.48% of the world's highly cited output in all fields just about half of what would be expected for parity at 1%. Comparative figures for other countries following Iran in the region are: Turkey producing 0.37% of the world's highly cited papers, Jordan 0.28%, Egypt 0.26% and Saudi Arabia 0.25%. External scientific collaboration accounted for 21% of the total research projects undertaken by researchers in Iran with largest collaborators being United States at 4.3%, United Kingdom at 3.3%, Canada 3.1%, Germany 1.7% and Australia at 1.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://researchanalytics.thomsonreuters.com/m/pdfs/globalresearchreport-aptme.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shota Rustaveli Theater and Georgia State Film University''' (TAFU) is one of the oldest universities in the [[Caucasus]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The Theater and Film University has dedicated solely to the visual and performing arts. The chief founder of the University was a well-known [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] theater actor and director, [[Lado Aleksi-Meskhishvili|Lado Meskhishvili]]

==History==

The first attempt to create a drama school in Georgia related to School Dramas in the Seminaries of Telavi (1782) and Tbilisi (1855), where by law it was possible to play “a comedy or any other conspicuous play once a week.” In 1880, the Statute of the Dramatic Society provided for it to “hold theater classes and temporary courses to prepare and train artists."

In 1912, [[Lado Meskhishivili]] attempted to establish drama courses and set up regulations.

In 1918, Giorgi Jabadari founded a studio and brought to it internationally acclaimed actors such as V. Anjaparidze, U. Chkheidze, A. Vasadze and Sh. Ghambashidze.

In 1922, a Drama Studio established under the leadership of A. Pagava, which according to the Resolution of the Council of People's Commissars dated October 10, 1922 (Protocol N 31), became the basis of the "Institute of Performing Arts." Studio participants enrolled to the second year. An additional enlistment for courses also announced.

The first rector of the Institute was Akaki Paghava, the Artistic Director was [[Kote Marjanishvili]], and the teachers were prominent scientists: I. Javakhishvili, D. Uznadze, G. Chubinashvili, A. Shanidze, G. Akhvlediani, A. Natishvili. The theater Directors were A. Akhmeteli, M. Koreli, and the writers K. Gamsakhurdia, G. Robakidze, N. Shiukashvili. In 1924, the first 21 graduated from the Institute. Among the graduates were: A. Khorava, V. Godziashvili, S. Takaishvili, T. Tsulukidze, M. Mrevlishvili, P. Kobakhidze, P. Kandelaki, P. Murghulia, G.Kuprashvili, N. Shengelaia, S.Chelidze, and others.

In 1927, the Institute ceased to function. New studios formed at the studio of the Rustaveli Theater in 1927-1935, which together with Sandro Akhmeteli was led by Akaki Vasadze, and later in 1935-1939 by Akaki Khorava.

The Training Program of the Studio and the level of graduate specialists is equivalent to other modern colleges. The Studio has trained actors for the theaters of Batumi, Abkhazia, Ossetia, Checheno-Ingushetia.

The Rustaveli Theater Studio taught 152 actors between 1927, and 1939.

A Studio was also established also in the Marjanishvili theater, where D. Janelidze had worked.

In 1933, A. Paghava built “Higher Courses of Performing Arts." Film Actor’s Courses founded at the 'State Film Industry.'

On September 1, 1939, by resolution of the Government in the Akaki Khorava and Akaki Pagava initiative, the Theater Institute was reestablished by the Rustaveli Theater and other Studios. The rector was A. Khorava and the deputy minister A. Paghava.

After A. Khorava the rectors were: D. Aleksidze, M. Kveselava, L. Kiknadze, I. Tavadze, E. Gugushvili, G. Zhordania, G. Lortkipanidze, G. Margvelashvili, N. Chkhaidze, G. Margvelashvili.

In 1992, the Theater Institute was renamed as the State Theater and Film Institute.

In 2002, the Institute was transformed into a university.

==Education==

Graduates of the Shota Rustaveli Theater and the State Film University graduates have had a defining effect on the cultural development and the character of twentieth-century Georgian theater.

In 2005 the Shota Rustaveli Theater and Georgian State Film University was joined by the Ekvtime Takaishvili State University of Culture and Arts.

The University trains actors of drama and film, musical theater, puppetry, marionettes, and pantomime, directors of drama, film, and television, cinematographers, theater and film critics, art historians, specialists of television and other media, choreographers, managers of tourism and experts in the cultural-educational sector.

Students have gained international success and the highest awards in various film and theater festivals and competitions.

The University has the D. Aleksidze theater, a scientific library, laboratories, and an educational, scientific institute, which prepares encyclopedias of Georgian theater and cinema.

The University has faculties of Drama, Film, and Television, Humanities, Social Sciences and Management and Georgian Folk Music and Dance, where over a thousand students study for Bachelor, Master, and Doctoral degrees.

The University played a huge role in training specialists of theater and cinema for the entire Caucasus Region. The University brought together professionals for Russian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Abkhazian, Ossetian, Ingush, Chechen and other theaters. Some now famous theaters founded by the training and diploma performances of the University (such as the Cinema Actors Theater, Meskhetian Theater, Theater Metekhi, Akhmeteli Theater, Theater of Saingilo, Pantomime Theater, and others).

The University maintains creative and scientific relations with other universities in different countries.

The University traditionally trains specialists who make a significant contribution to the development of Georgian Regional Theaters.

The University publishes a newspaper "Duruji." In 2005-2009, its publishing house issued a paper “Culture," which was a joint publication of three art universities. The “Centaur” publishing house produces textbooks, manuals, scientific works and monographs written by professors of the University and also a journal, "Art Science Studies."

The University locates in two buildings: the first building at Rustaveli Ave. N 19-23, the second building at David Agmashenebeli Ave. N40.

Among the first graduates of the institute in 1924 were A. Khorava, V. Godziashvili, T. Tsulukidze, S. Takaishvili and M. Mrevlishvili. The professors were Akaki Paghava, Kote Marjanishvili, Mikheil Koreli, Sandro Akhmeteli and Niko Shiukashvili.

Kote Marjanishvili was the artistic director of the Institute. Instead of faculties, there were studios of drama and opera, and also schools of opera choir, plasticity, and rhythmic gymnastics. Lectures got delivered by I. Javakhishvili, D. Uznadze, G. Chubinashvili, A. Shanidze and others.

In 1926, the institute ceased to function. In 1927-39 only the Rustaveli Theater Studio was working.

In September 1939, the studios of Rustaveli and Marjanishvili Theaters merged with the studio of Film Fabric and the theater Institute has been restored. The members of these studios were accepted in the second, third and fourth courses of the studio.

In 1940, the Faculty of Drama Direction established in the Theater Institute.

In 1956, the Institute expanded again, Music Department added to the Drama Faculty. In 1970, the Puppet Theater Actors specialization joined the Drama Faculty. Its founders were Shota Tsutsqiridze and Givi Sarchimelidze.

Since 1969, the Pantomime Theater Actor’s specialty became he part of the Drama Faculty, in 1978, the Pantomime Theater Actor specialization founded under the guidance of Amiran Shalikashvili

Over the years, the department of actor's skills and stage direction was headed by D. Alexsidze, K. Pataridze.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9568">The '''1997 Simon Fraser University harassment controversy''' was a series of events in [[Canada]] at [[Simon Fraser University]]. In the case at the center of the controversy, [[Rachel Marsden]], then a student, and Liam Donnelly, a [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] [[coach (sport)|coach]], accused each other of [[sexual harassment]].  

Following an internal hearing that the coach declined to participate in, he was dismissed, but reinstated after the case went public.  The case was widely reported in the Canadian press because of the topic of sexual harassment, and controversy over the procedures for investigating it. Ultimately, the case led to the resignation of university president [[John Stubbs (educator)|John Stubbs]] and the reopening and reversal of eleven prior sexual harassment decisions by the university as well as the revision of its harassment policies.

==Case==
In late 1996, [[Simon Fraser University]] (SFU) student [[Rachel Marsden]] and SFU [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] [[coach (sport)|coach]] Liam Donnelly lodged complaints with the SFU harassment office against one another over events that occurred in 1994 and 1995. Marsden's formal complaint involved "seven allegations of unwanted sexual attention, two allegations of intimidating behaviour and a general charge of psychological sexual harassment."&lt;ref name=7allegations&gt;Robert Matas, "SFU report details sex allegations; panel based ruling supporting student’s claim of harassment on balance of probability", The Globe and Mail, 17 July 1997 A4&lt;/ref&gt; Donnelly denied any romantic relationship with Marsden and claimed that she sexually harassed him.&lt;ref name=earlymorning&gt;Steve Simmons, 'The Last Word', The Toronto Sun, June 10, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DonnellysTale2&gt;Dave Cunningham,'Simon Fraser University’s sinking credibility', British Columbia Report, June 30, 1997, v.8(44) Je 30′97 pg 31&lt;/ref&gt;

==SFU process==
The university harassment procedures required a hearing before a panel made up of three members of the university community.  On the advice of his lawyer, the coach dropped his own complaint against Marsden and took it instead to the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP).&lt;ref name=legalconcerns&gt;Marina Jimenez, “Coach presents lurid evidence to get SFU job back.” ''[[Vancouver Sun]]''  31 May 1997, A1.&lt;/ref&gt; No charges were laid after Donnelly made the complaint. In addition, he did not attend the hearing of Marsden's complaint against him.&lt;ref name=Donnellysadvice&gt;Robert Matas, "SFU report details sex allegations; panel based ruling supporting student’s claim of harassment on balance of probability", ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 17 July 1997 A4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=procedure&gt;Robert Matas, "SFU president ignored new harassment information University head was concerned that new material provided to him had not been presented to investigative panel", ''The Globe and Mail'', 11 June 1997, A10&lt;/ref&gt; The panel met, heard Marsden's evidence, and finalized its decision. The result was that Donnelly was fired on May 23, 1997.&lt;ref name=SFUjustifies&gt;"University defends firing of coach who skipped hearing", ''[[The Record (Waterloo Region)|The Kitchener-Waterloo Record]]'' 6 June 1997, pg. A12&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel's report, however, was later leaked to the media. In it the panelists admitted that the specific incidents about which the student complained appeared insignificant and innocuous, but when "the sum total" was considered, it was determined that her complaint was true on a balance of probability. The panel's report, issued on October 11, 1996, recommended that Donnelly be dismissed and that Marsden be financially compensated, given counselling, and be helped with her academic career.&lt;ref name=Donnellysadvice /&gt;&lt;ref name=boardestablish&gt;SFU news, [https://www.sfu.ca/sfunews/sfnews/1997/June19/donnelly.html Independent arbitration board established to review controversial Donnelly dismissal], June 19, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

After dismissing his lawyer and hiring another, Donnelly appealed the ruling and went public with his side of the story. At this time, his colleagues and team-members corroborated his version of events.&lt;ref name=corroborates&gt;Marina Jiménez, "Swim team stands by its fired SFU coach", ''Vancouver Sun'', May 29, 1997, B1&lt;/ref&gt;  SFU refused to reopen the hearing, insisting that Donnelly's boycott of the hearing was itself sufficient justification for his dismissal.&lt;ref name=SFUjustifies /&gt; University policy, however, allowed for employees to file for arbitration in dismissal cases, which Donnelly did.&lt;ref name=boardestablish /&gt;&lt;ref name=arbsought&gt;"Fired swim coach to seek arbitration Simon Fraser won’t change its decision after sexual harassment charge countered", ''The Globe and Mail'', 2 June 1997, C11&lt;/ref&gt; Marsden was invited to participate, but declined.&lt;ref name=refuseparticipate&gt;Marina Jiménez and Scott Simpson, "Rachel Marsden goes public in an effort to clear her name" ''Vancouver Sun'', July 17, 1997, A1&lt;/ref&gt; As a first step in the arbitration process, Donnelly and the university went into voluntary mediation. They agreed to reinstate Donnelly on the grounds that "the findings of the harassment panel were based on Ms. Marsden's credibility. Inconsistencies between her statements before the panel and her response to Mr. Donnelly's harassment complaint cast doubt on her credibility." However, Marsden was not a party to this arbitration and the case never went to any court.

SFU rehired Donnelly and committed to pay his legal fees up to $35,000,&lt;ref name=rehire&gt;"SFU reaches settlement with fired swim coach", ''Globe and Mail'', 25 July 1997, A7&lt;/ref&gt; a sum that was raised to $60,000 a year later.&lt;ref name=amountraised&gt;Robert Matas, "University improves payout to coach SFU decision among several reversals after review of harassment investigations", ''The Globe and Mail'', 2 May 1998, A5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional consequences==
The SFU administration was heavily criticized for its handling of the case, including criticism from the faculty. The president of SFU, [[John Stubbs (educator)|John Stubbs]], approved a secret settlement with Marsden by which she was given $12,000 to compensate her for a scholarship she failed to receive, lost summer employment and injuries to her feelings.&lt;ref name=secretsettlement&gt;''Globe and Mail'', 9 June 1997: Reported deal in harassment case troubles SFU faculty&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the case, SFU radically revised its policies for dealing with harassment.&lt;ref name=SFUharassment&gt;'A difficult search for a delicate balance', ''[[Maclean's]]'' v. 110, no. 26 (July 1, 1997): p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; John Stubbs, who had endorsed Donnelly's dismissal, resigned in December 1997 as university president in the wake of the scandal, although he remained on the university faculty.&lt;ref name=Stubbsresigns&gt;Ian Bailey, "Simon Fraser president quits over handling of sex cases", Canadian Press Newswire, December 12, 1997, section D 12′97&lt;/ref&gt; SFU also reopened ten other harassment cases and reversed their decisions.&lt;ref name=reopened&gt;"Simon Fraser cites mismanagement, reopens harassment cases", Canadian Press Newswire, October 25, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal consequences==
Due to the controversy, media in Canada have been much more cautious about reporting on harassment claims prior to them being presented in the courts.&lt;ref name="Davison"&gt;

This, in turn, creates a greater silence about sexual harassment and greater pressure for women athletes to comply with heterosexualized femininity.

Stockbridge has two [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA) teams: basketball and golf. As a two–year school, its students are not allowed by the NCAA to play on varsity teams. Stockbridge teams compete against small four-year schools, preparatory schools, and community colleges. Stockbridge students may try out for the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association equestrian team and Intercollegiate Dressage Association team. These teams compete throughout the year with other colleges in the Northeast. Students may also take advantage of many noncompetitive recreational opportunities or participate in the University of Massachusetts' intramural program, one of the largest in the East.

== Greek life ==
[[Alpha Tau Gamma]] is the social and academic fraternity of the Stockbridge School of Agriculture. Their Chapter House is located at 118 Sunset Avenue on several acres of land near the Southwest dormitories.
There has been at several time throughout the history of the Stockbridge School of Agriculture a sorority Sigma Sigma Alpha. They are currently not active on campus.

'''''Teach For America Counter-Narratives: Alumni Speak Up and Speak Out''''' ({{ISBN|1433128764}}) is an edited book containing 20 counter-narratives about Teach For America (TFA).  The volume was edited by T. Jameson Brewer and Kathleen deMarrais and was published by Peter Lang in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Teach For America Counter-Narratives: Alumni Speak Up and Speak Out|publisher = Peter Lang Publishing Inc.|date = 2015-06-28|isbn = 9781433128769}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teach For America Counter-Narratives|url = http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=84101&amp;concordeid=312876|website = www.peterlang.com|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each chapter, written by TFA alumni, sheds new light on the once-celebrated organization.  With narratives covering the entire span of TFA's 25 years of operations, the chapters are organized into three broad categories: (1) TFA's Recruitment, Training, and Support Structure; (2) TFA's Approach to Diversity; and (3) TFA's Approach to Criticism and Critics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3545">'''Teofila "Totti" Cohen''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM|OBE}}, ''née'' '''Kaplun''' (5 March 1932 &amp;ndash; 29 August 2010) was an Australian educational reformer and solicitor who served as president of the Federation of [[Parents and Citizens]] Associations of New South Wales from 1973 to 1980.

She was born in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]] to [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] emigrants Stanley Kaplun and Adel, ''née'' Gutman. She attended local primary schools and then [[Parramatta High School|Parramatta]] and [[Sydney Girls' High School|Sydney Girls']] high schools. She topped the state in history in the Leaving Certificate, also winning first-class honours in English and Latin; consequently she won a scholarship to the [[University of Sydney]], where she graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and a [[Bachelor of Law]] in 1956. In that year she married Neville Albert Cohen; they would adopt one son in 1960 before Cohen gave birth to another in 1961. She was the first woman employed as a solicitor at Minter Simpson, before moving to F. W. Jenkins and Co. which she eventually bought after Jenkins's death.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oa.anu.edu.au/obituary/cohen-teofila-totti-16852|title=Cohen, Teofila (Totti) (1932-2010)|last=Brown|first=Malcolm|work=Obituaries Australia|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|date=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She explored the option of teaching when her sons began attending school and enrolled externally at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], but discovered that teaching positions were only readily available north of [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]] and gave up the idea. She joined the Parents and Citizens (P&amp;C) Association at [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee]] and by 1968 rose to the state council. She ran as a candidate for the [[Defence of Government Schools]] group in the [[Australian federal election, 1969|1969 federal election]], challenging the [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], [[William Aston|Sir William Aston]], for his seat of [[Division of Phillip|Phillip]]; she received 2.3% of the vote. In 1973 she was elected president of the Federation of P&amp;C Associations, and significantly increased the influence and political involvement of the organisation. Awarded an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1978, she was a parent representative on the Education Commission and vice-president of the Australian Council of School Organisations. She retired in 1980.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lofthouse|first=Andrea|title=Who's Who of Australian Women|year=1982|publisher=Methuen Australia|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her retirement from the P&amp;C presidency, Cohen served part-time on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Consumer, Trading and Tenancy Tribunal, and was chairwoman of the New South Wales Privacy Committee from 1983 to 1993. Awarded the [[Member of the Order of Australia|AM]] in 1987, she was also involved in the National Council of Jewish Women and the Jewish Board of Deputies. She died in 2010.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

In phylogenetic studies, research data are collected or generated,  such as  comparative observations (e.g. [[Maximum_parsimony_(phylogenetics)#Character_data|character state matrices]] or [[multiple sequence alignment]]s) made on a set of [[taxa]], [[metadata]] about these taxa, and the [[phylogenetic tree]]s  that are inferred to best describe the evolutionary relationships between the taxa.

== Mission ==

The purpose of the TreeBASE project is to provide stable records and identifiers for these data, so that other workers can refer to their deposited data in their publication, and other scientists can locate the data and use them to verify the original research or to include or extend  them in further analyses.

== History and funding ==

The project was started in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanderson|first=M. J.|author2=M. J. Donoghue |author3=W. Piel |author4=T.

Research Report from the National Institute for Environmental Studies|year=2002|issue=171|pages=41–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; with funding from the US [[National Science Foundation]]. After this prototype, a redesign was initiated under the CIPRES&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CyberInfrastructure for Phylogenetic Research|url=http://www.phylo.org|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; project. This new version was released in March 2010 and has been supported by, among others, the pPOD project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=processing PhylOData|url=http://www.phylodata.org|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which funded the addition of a [[RESTful]] web service interface with [[Contextual Query Language|CQL]] search facilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vos|first=Rutger A.|author2=Hilmar Lapp |author3=William H.

Starting in Winter 2010, TreeBASE was regorganized and became associated with the [[Phyloinformatics Research Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phyloinformatics Research Foundation|url=http://www.phylofoundation.org|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LÜK Kasten mit Übungsheft.jpg|thumb|A Tutor Systems box with 24 tiles.]]
'''Tutor Systems''' is an Australian ludic learning tool that allows learners to check their answers for accuracy themselves. There are different sets of tasks, from pre-school to grammar school. This is the English adaptation of German-speaking ''LÜK'', of which ''LÜK'' means "lernen, üben, kontrollieren" (learn, practice, check).

== History ==
This learning tool was invented in the 1960s by the German Heinz Vogel (1919-1980) and is still used successfully today at home, in nursery, primary and secondary schools. Australia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teaching.com.au/catalogue?catalogue=MTA&amp;category=MTA-TUTOR-SYSTEMS Tutor Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; and New Zealand, Tutor Systems has been published since the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teaching.com.au/catalogue?catalogue=MTA&amp;category=MTA-TUTOR-SYSTEMS Tutor Systems by Modern Teaching Aids Pty Ltd]&lt;/ref&gt; and also exported to Malaysia&lt;ref&gt;[http://memoriantik.blogspot.ch/2011/05/tutor-systems-antik.html Malaysian Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.rakuten.co.jp/thrive/cabinet/01217460/chu_kit12.jpg?_ex=128x128 Rakuten Co.]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://auction.rakuten.co.jp/item/12051581/a/10000222/ 受験対策に] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219003243/http://auction.rakuten.co.jp/item/12051581/a/10000222/ |date=2014-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are versions in 18 languages distributed in 35 countries, including ''Veritech'' in France and Canada, ''LÜK'' in German-speaking countries, ''YUP'' in Turkey, ''LYCK'' in Sweden and ''ARCO'' in Venezuela.&lt;ref name="west"&gt;[https://verlage.westermanngruppe.de/luek/landing/lernen-ueben-kontrollieren/50-jahre-luek 50 Jahre LÜK!: LÜK - Lernen, Üben, Kontrollieren]&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced by ''Modern Teaching Aid'' under licence of the [[Westermann Verlag]].

== Use ==
The set consists of a workbook, a flat red box ("Tutor plastic tray") with small depressions and a number of tiles that fit into the depressions and are printed on both sides - on the front with a number, on the back with the part of a motif. The objective is to solve a set of tasks from the workbook and insert the tiles into the tray according to the results. The tray is then closed, turned over and re-opened - comparing the pattern on the back of the tiles and the printed drawing in the workbook, students see if all the tasks have been solved correctly. Already in the first year, more than 15 000 trays were sold. Today about 600 different workbooks are available and cover all school branches.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt;

''Tutor Systems'' is often used like other classical self-control learning devices in the context of individual work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://methodenpool.uni-koeln.de/werkstatt/werkstatt_darstellung.html Methodenpool University Cologne]&lt;/ref&gt; It is used mostly in [[pre-school]]s and [[primary school]]s, but also in [[grammar school]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccbuchner.de Latin in grammar schools]&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[university]] to obtain a more sustainable learning success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/0307-4412(78)90006-7/pdf LÜK/Tutor Systems at a biochemical Institute (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1914, the Superintendent of Schools in [[Gary, Indiana]], requested that local ministers teach principles of [[Christianity]] to school students during the school day.&lt;ref name="McCollum" /&gt; In 1946, Erwin L. Shaver wrote an article entitled, "The Movement for Weekday Religious Education" for the journal, ''Religious Education''&lt;ref name="Shaver"&gt;Shaver, Erwin L. "The Movement for Weekday Religious Education". ''Religious Education'', Vol. 41 No. 1. 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in re: ''[[McCollum v. Board of Education]]'' that religious classes held on public school property are unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="McCollum" /&gt; However, classes continued in locations where the program was held outside school grounds. (See also "Criticisms", below.) The Supreme Court later ruled, in re: ''[[Zorach v. Clauson]]'', that religious classes held outside school grounds, but during the school day, did meet constitutional requirements dictating the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]].

==Current program==
Weekday Religious Education classes are currently offered in several school districts in the United States. The following is a partial list, sorted by state:

In Fort Wayne, Indiana, classes are offered to children in the third, fourth, and fifth [[Educational stages|grades]]. Classes in the third grade focus upon introducing students to a "[[Evangelicalism|personal relationship]] with [[Jesus Christ]]". Third graders also learn about "[[Judaism|Hebrew traditions]]", among which are "[[Shabbat|Sabbath]], the Greatest Commandment, synagogue school and Jesus visiting Jerusalem". Fourth grade classes incorporate lessons about the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]] and other figures from the [[Old Testament]]. In the fifth grade, students are taught that the [[Bible]] is the "inspired Word of God." Classes in Fort Wayne, Indiana use the [[Good News Bible]].&lt;ref name="Associated Churches" /&gt;

Other Indiana programs are supported by the Gideons, International and use the [[New King James Version]] of the Bible.  Some programs teach Creation Science, Old and New Testament Survey and the Life of Christ as young as second grade.

==Criticisms==
Dahlia Lithwick, in her article for [[Slate (magazine)|Slate magazine]],&lt;ref name="Lithwick" /&gt; summarized several criticisms of the Weekday Religious Education program as administered at that time in [[Staunton, Virginia]]. Among these criticisms is that communities in which WRE classes are taught ostracize those students who elect to opt out of the program;&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;Graham, Chris. [http://www.augustafreepress.com/stories/storyReader$31696 Board preserves WRE]. ''Augusta Free Press'', February 15, 2005. Accessed July 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; that WRE classes subtract from classroom time, making education mandated by [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] programs such as the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] more difficult; that WRE inherently discriminates against those who aren't Christians; and that WRE promotes an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] denominational or sectarian viewpoint.
