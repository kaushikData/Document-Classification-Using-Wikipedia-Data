The '''AN/APG-68''' [[radar]] is a long range (up to 296&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deagel.com/Aircraft-Warners-and-Sensors/ANAPG-68_a001560001.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pulse-doppler]] radar designed by Westinghouse (now [[Northrop Grumman]]) to replace [[AN/APG-66]] [[radar]] in the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]].  The AN/APG-68(V)8 and earlier radar system consists of the following [[line-replaceable unit]]s:
* [[Antenna (radio)|Antenna]]
* Dual Mode [[Transmitter]] (DMT)
* Modular Low-power radio frequency (MLPRF)
* Programmable [[signal processor]] (PSP)

The AN/APG-68(V)9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.es.northropgrumman.com/solutions/apg68/assets/APG68.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526024024/http://www.es.northropgrumman.com/solutions/apg68/assets/APG68.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; radar system consists of the following [[line-replaceable unit]]s:
* [[Antenna (radio)|Antenna]]
* Medium Duty Transmitter (MDT)
* Modular Receiver/Exciter (MoRE)
* Common Radar Processor (CoRP)

The AN/APG-68(V)9 radar is the latest development. Besides the increase in scan range compared to the previous version, it has a [[Synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) capability.

The APG-68(V)9 has equipped several variants, including the F-16D Block 52+s of the [[Israeli Air Force]], [[Chilean Air Force]], [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]], [[Turkish Air Force]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/02/25/323057/turkey-completes-deal-for-30-new-f-16s.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Moroccan Air Force]] and [[Greek Air Force]], [[Pakistan Air Force]],F-16C/D Block 52+s of the [[Polish Air Force]] and F-16 A/B Block 15 MLU of the [[Royal Thai Air Force]]

==Specifications==
*Frequency: Starting Envelope frequency around 9.86&amp;nbsp;GHz.
*Under AIS Testing as high as 26&amp;nbsp;GHz
*Range: 296.32&amp;nbsp;km, 184 miles
*Range for 5m2 aerial target is 105km&lt;ref&gt;http://defence.pk/threads/radar-ranges-of-different-fighters.94948/page-7&lt;/ref&gt;
*Search cone: 120 degrees × 120 degrees
*Azimuth angular coverage: ±10 degrees / ± 30 degrees / ± 60 degrees
*Programmable Signal Processor (PSP) - The core radar component which is responsible for signal processing, frequency selection, signal digitization for B-Scope display.  The PSP is controlled through the F-16 Heads Down Display Set (HDDS) or what is commonly called the [[Multi-Function Display]]s (MFDs).  The PSP is directed by the system [[operational flight program]] (OFP), which is controlled and modified for new threats or addition radar system requirements.  The PSP also contains all the controls circuitry for radar [[Air-to-air missile|A/A]] and [[air-to-ground weaponry|A/G]] operational scan patterns and SAR/ISAR operation.
*Modular Low Powered Radio Frequency (MLPRF) - The [[signal generator|frequency generator]] for the radar system.  Frequency generation is dependent on the random frequency selection from the radar tables within the PSP upon system start-up.  The MLPRF will generate a small amount of RF Drive, which is sent to the Dual Mode Transmitter (DMT), where it is amplified and a small RF sample is sent to the MLPRF for comparison checksum (more like a check and balance system).  The MLPRF also is responsible for the receiving of the radar return, generating the RF injection noise (for RF discrimination), and the processed RF within the MLPRF is then later sent to the PSP for video processing and threat/target matching against the radar threat tables within the PSP, prior to flightcrew system display.
*Dual Mode Transmitter (DMT) - A 24,000 volt radar transmitter, containing a [[Travelling wave tube|TWT]], which generates the amplified RF to be sent to the radar Antenna for system emission.  The TWT operates by optical pulses received from the DMT's internal Pulse Decker Unit and TWT Cathode/Anode voltage inputs.
*Antenna - A [[planar array]] antenna, which is constructed to receive RF data through a [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] system.  The transmitted and received pulses are controlled in time by the PMW (Pulse Modulated Wave) radar design, and the waveguide [[duplexer]] assembly.  Internal to the antenna are Uniphaser Assemblies (used for quadrature phase control), Phase Shifters (used of quadrature I/Q data) and [[gimbal]]ized motor control for antenna positioning and position correction.

The '''ATM Industry Association''' ('''ATMIA'''), originally the '''ATM Owners Association''', was established in 1997 in the United States as a global [[nonprofit]] [[trade association]] to service an industry that built around the global growth of the [[Automated teller machine|ATM]].

==History ==
[[File:50 Ann ATM.jpg|thumb|Official logo of the 50th anniversary of the first ATM]]

Liberalization of the retail banking markets in the USA during the 1980s and early 1990s, resulted in [[depository institutions]] losing their monopoly on [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] while [[Independent_ATM_deployer | Independent ATM Deployers (IAD)]] were allowed to compete in the provision of after-hours access to [[cash]].&lt;ref name="KC Fed"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hayashi |first1=Fumiko |last2=Sullivan |first2=Richard |last3=Weiner |first3=Stuart E. |  url=https://www.kansascityfed.org/PUBLICAT/PSR/BksJournArticles/ATMpaper.pdf |title= A Guide to the ATM and Debit Card Industry |publisher= Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City |date=2003 |isbn=0-9744809-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth in this market led Tom Harper and Alan Fryrear to establish the ''ATM Owners’ Association'' (ATMOA) in late 1997 with no staff (except Harper), zero budget, and only a handful of members.&lt;ref name="Networld Media Group"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Tom |last1=Harper |first2=Bernardo |last2=Batiz-Lazo |url=https://www.amazon.com/Cash-Box-Invention-Globalization-ATM/dp/1935497626/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467220875&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Cash+box |title= Cash Box: The Invention and Globalization of the ATM |publisher= Networld Media Group |date=2013 |isbn=1935497626}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first official ATMOA planning meeting took place on October 9, 1998, at the end of the Faulkner &amp; Gray Advanced ATM Conference in [[San Diego]], CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmmarketplace.com/news/atmoa-planning-meeting-announcement/|title=ATMOA Planning Meeting Announcement|date=4 April 2000|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group voted Lyle Elias as the new president, ratified a motion to change their name to the ''ATM Industry Association'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/ATMIA|title=ATMIA|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed several committees and took steps to launch their own industry conference.

In 2000, Michael Lee joined ATMIA as their European executive director and in 2004, he was named chief executive officer and board member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kioskmarketplace.com/top-100/mike-lee-named-ceo-of-atmia-2/|title=Mike Lee named CEO of ATMIA|date=20 July 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progress in bringing industry participants together resulted in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] identifying ATMIA as ''"the leading trade group"'' in the global cash distribution industry in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/03/us/stealing-code-con-men-cash-machines-criminals-focus-atm-s-weak-link-banking.html|title=STEALING THE CODE: Con Men and Cash Machines; Criminals Focus on A.T.M.'s, Weak Link in Banking System|date=3 August 2003|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, ATMIA had over 8,000 members in 66 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atmia.com/about-us/membership-composition/|title=Membership Composition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The membership base included banks and other depository institutions, IADs, [[payment card]] companies, [[cash management]] service companies, [[interbank network]] companies, ATM design and manufacturing companies, and other related service providers.

An '''application strings manager''' is a software tool primarily designed to optimize the download and storage of strings files used and produced in [[software development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4228076/|title=Scalable, Distributed, Dynamic Resource Management for the ARMS Distributed Real-Time Embedded System - IEEE Conference Publication|last=|first=|date=11 June 2007|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|publisher=[[IEEE]]|language=en-US|isbn=1-4244-0909-8|issn=1530-2075|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It centralizes the management of all the product strings generated and used by an organization to overcome the complexity arising from the diversity of strings types, and their position in the overall content workflow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/262693352|title=Distributed applications and interoperable systems : 6th IFIP WG 6.1 International Conference, DAIS 2006, Bologna, Italy, June 14-16, 2006 ; proceedings|date=2006|publisher=Springer|others=Eliassen, Frank., Montresor, Alberto.|isbn=3540351264|location=Berlin|oclc=262693352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58598204|title=RTAS 2005 : 11th IEEE Real Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium : proceedings : 7-10 March, 2005, San Francisco, Calif.|date=2005|publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press|others=IEEE Computer Society.

== Uses ==
Application strings manager is a [[software repository]] for text files, strings, and their corresponding keys. It can be used to store strings files produced by an organization itself, such as product content strings and [[User interface|UI]] content strings, or for third-party content which must be treated differently for both technical and workflow reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~spaunov/files/QoS.pdf|title=Domain-Specific Modeling Languages for Configuring and Evaluating Enterprise DRE System Quality of Service|last=Paunov|first=Stoyan|last2=Hill|first2=James|date=|website=Vanderbilt University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Schmidt|first3=Douglas|last4=D.

=== Uses in software development ===
To manage the [[Source code|source files]] used in [[software development]], organizations typically use [[Version control|revision control]]. The many source files used in software development are eventually built into the product strings (also known as "strings files") which constitute the components of a software product. Consequently, a software product may comprise hundreds and even thousands of individual product strings which must be managed in order to efficiently maintain a coherent and functional software product. This function of managing the product strings is done by an application strings manager. An application strings manager can be thought of as being to strings what revision control is to source files.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a60c/48318c06014dafed77015d46b2d67d33e71e.pdf|title=AIDING THE DEPLOYMENT AND CONFIGURATION OF COMPONENT MIDDLEWARE IN DISTRIBURED, REAL-TIME AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS|last=G. Paunov|first=Stoyan|date=May 2006|website=semanticscholar.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Repository managers ===
Main factors and features of a strings manager include:

* Files manager – files manager simply stores local copies of files.
* Workflow 
* High availability -  a high availability instance allows an enterprise to overcome the risk associated with downtime, through automatic [[Failover Clustering|failover]]. This is achieved by having a redundant set of repository managers work against the same [[database]] and [[File system|file storage]], maintaining enterprise-wide stability and performance at all times.
* User restrictions - strings managers can be integrated with other organizational systems such as [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] or [[Single sign-on|Single Sign-On]] [[Server (computing)|servers]] to centralized user management.

'''Automated tissue image analysis''' is a process by which computer-controlled [[automatic test equipment]] is used to evaluate [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] samples, using computations to derive quantitative measurements from an image to avoid subjective errors.

In a typical application, automated tissue image analysis could be used to measure the aggregate activity of [[cancer cell]]s in a [[biopsy]] of a [[cancer]]ous [[tumor]] taken from a patient.  In [[breast cancer]] patients, for example, automated tissue image analysis may be used to test for high levels of [[proteins]] known to be present in more aggressive forms of breast cancers.

==Applications==
Automated tissue imaging analysis can significantly reduce uncertainty in characterizing [[tumors]] compared to evaluations done by [[histologist]]s,&lt;ref name="O'Gorman_1985"&gt;

==Processes==
The [[United States of America|United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] classifies these systems as [[medical device]]s, under the general instrumentation category of [[automatic test equipment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEHLxh9wxZIC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=%22FDA+automatic+test+equipment%22 |title=Testing Computer Systems for FDA/MHRA Compliance - David Stokes - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2003-11-25|accessdate=2012-07-12|isbn=9780849321634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATIS have seven basic processes (sample preparation, image acquisition, image analysis, results reporting, data storage, network communication, and self-system diagnostics) and realization of these functions highly accurate hardware and well-integrated, complex, and expensive software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.aca.2005.11.083  |title=Analytica Chimica Acta - Advances in cancer tissue microarray technology: Towards improved understanding and diagnostics  |date= | volume=564 |journal=Analytica Chimica Acta |pages=74–81|pmc=2583100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation===
Specimen preparation is critical for evaluating the tumor in the automated system.  In the first part of the preparation process the biopsied tissue is cut to an appropriate size (typically 4&amp;nbsp;mm), fixed in buffered [[formalin]], dehydrated in ethanol-[[xylene]], embedded in [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], [[thin section]]ed typically to 4&amp;nbsp;um slices, then mounted onto at least two [[barcode]]d slides (a [[scientific control|control]] and a test). Next the paraffin is removed from the tissue, the tissue is rehydrated, then [[staining|stained]].  Any inconsistency in these procedures from case to case may result in uncertainties in the outcome of the analysis. These potential and irreducible inconsistencies in analysis results motivated the development of Automated Tissue Image Systems.

===Acquisition===
Digital micrographs are acquired of the stained specimen on the glass slide. The images are taken by a set of [[charge-coupled devices]] (CCD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=A CCD-based tissue imaging system
|author1=MacDonald, J. H. |author2=Wells, K. |author3=Reader, A. J. |author4=Ott, R. J. |publisher=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis===

Image analysis involves complex computer algorithms which identify and characterize cellular color, shape, and quantity of the tissue sample using image pattern recognition technology based on [[vector quantization]]. Vector representations of objects in the image, as opposed to bitmap representations, have superior zoom-in ability. Once the sample image has been acquired and resident in the computer's random access memory as a large array of 0's and 1's, a programmer knowledgeable in cellular architecture can develop deterministic [[algorithms]] applied to the entire memory space to detect cell patterns from previously defined cellular structures and formations known to be significant.&lt;ref name="han12cell"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Han, J.W.| author2=Breckon, T.P.| author3=Randell, D.A.| author4=Landini, G.| title=The Application of Support Vector Machine Classification to Detect Cell Nuclei for Automated Microscopy| journal=Machine Vision and Applications| year=2012| volume=23| pages=15–24| publisher=Springer| doi=10.1007/s00138-010-0275-y| issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aggregate algorithm outcome is a set of measurements that is far superior to any human sensitivity to intensity or [[luminance]] and color hue, while at the same time improving test consistency from eyeball to eyeball.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Reporting===
The systems have the capability of presenting the resulting data in text and graphically, including on high definition monitors, to the system user.  [[Computer printers]], as relatively low image resolution devices, are used mostly to present final [[pathology]] reports that could include text and graphics.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Storage===

Storage of the acquired data (graphical digital slide files and text data) involves saving system information in a [[data storage device]] system having at least convenient retrieval, and file management capabilities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Medical imaging industry standards includes the [[Picture Archiving and Communication Systems]] (PACS), of European origin, which are image and information management solutions in computer networks that allow hospitals and clinics to acquire, distribute and archive medical images and diagnostic reports across the enterprise. Another standard of European origin is the Data and Picture Archiving and Communication System (DPACS). Although medical images can be stored in various formats, a common format has been Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine ([[DICOM]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The '''bioconversion of biomass to mixed alcohol fuels''' can be accomplished using the MixAlco process. Through bioconversion of [[biomass]] to a mixed [[alcohol fuel]], more energy from the biomass will end up as liquid fuels than in converting biomass to [[ethanol]] by [[yeast]] fermentation.

The process involves a biological/chemical method for converting any [[biodegradation|biodegradable]] material (e.g., urban wastes, such as [[municipal solid waste]], [[biodegradable waste]], and [[sewage treatment|sewage sludge]], agricultural residues such as [[corn stover]], sugarcane [[bagasse]], [[cotton gin]] trash, [[manure]]) into useful chemicals, such as [[carboxylic acids]] (e.g., [[Acetic acid|acetic]], [[Propionic acid|propionic]], [[butyric acid]]), [[ketones]] (e.g., acetone, [[methyl ethyl ketone]], [[diethyl ketone]]) and [[biofuels]], such as a mixture of primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, [[Propan-1-ol|propanol]], [[n-Butanol|''n''-butanol]]) and/or a mixture of secondary alcohols (e.g., [[isopropanol]], [[2-butanol]], 3-pentanol). Because of the many products that can be economically produced, this process is a true [[biorefinery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://soilcrop.tamu.edu/podcasts/seminars/MarkHoltzapple/9-5-07-640.wmv Advanced Biomass Refinery – Third-Generation 2007 (video)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701101942/http://soilcrop.tamu.edu//podcasts/seminars/MarkHoltzapple/9-5-07-640.wmv |date=1 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/Region6/6pd/pd-u-sw/wte_ftworth/cafo/holtzapple.pdf EPA Presentation on the process]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2005/techprogram/P14000.HTM Application]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:MixAlco Pilot Plant.JPG|right|thumbnail|500px|Pilot Plant ([[College Station, Texas|College Station]], [[Texas]])]]
The process uses a mixed culture of naturally occurring microorganisms found in natural habitats such as the [[rumen]] of cattle, [[termite]] guts, and marine and terrestrial swamps to [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobically digest]] biomass into a mixture of carboxylic acids produced during the [[acidogenesis|acidogenic]] and [[acetogenesis|acetogenic]] stages of [[anaerobic digestion]], however with the inhibition of the [[methanogenesis|methanogenic]] final stage. The more popular methods for production of ethanol and [[cellulosic ethanol]] use enzymes that must be isolated first to be added to the biomass and thus convert the starch or cellulose into simple sugars, followed then by yeast fermentation into ethanol.

As the microoganisms anaerobically digest the biomass and convert it into a mixture of carboxylic acids, the [[pH]] must be controlled. This is done by the addition of a [[buffering agent]] (e.g., [[ammonium bicarbonate]], [[calcium carbonate]]), thus yielding a mixture of [[carboxylate]] salts. [[Methanogenesis]], being the natural final stage of anaerobic digestion, is inhibited by the presence of the [[ammonium]] ions or by the addition of an inhibitor (e.g., [[iodoform]]).  The resulting fermentation broth contains the produced carboxylate salts that must be dewatered. This is achieved efficiently by [[vapor-compression evaporation]]. Further chemical refining of the dewatered fermentation broth may then take place depending on the final chemical or biofuel product desired.

The condensed distilled water from the vapor-compression evaporation system is recycled back to the fermentation. On the other hand, if raw sewage or other waste water with high [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] in need of treatment is used as the water for the fermentation, the condensed distilled water from the evaporation can be recycled back to the city or to the original source of the high-BOD waste water. Thus, this process can also serve as a [[water treatment]] facility, while producing valuable chemicals or biofuels.

Because the system uses a mixed culture of microorganisms, besides not needing any enzyme addition, the fermentation requires no sterility or aseptic conditions, making this front step in the process more economical than in more popular methods for the production of cellulosic ethanol. These savings in the front end of the process, where volumes are large, allows flexibility for further chemical transformations after dewatering, where volumes are small.

==Carboxylic acids==
{{Details|Carboxylic acid}}
[[Carboxylic acids]] can be regenerated from the carboxylate salts using a process known as "acid springing". This process makes use of a high-molecular-weight [[tertiary amine]] (e.g., trioctylamine), which is switched with the [[cation]] (e.g., ammonium or calcium). The resulting amine carboxylate can then be thermally decomposed into the amine itself, which is recycled, and the corresponding [[carboxylic acid]]. In this way, theoretically, no chemicals are consumed or wastes produced during this step.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, S.A. 2000. Conversion of carboxylate salts to carboxylic acids via reactive distillation. M.S. Thesis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ketones==
{{Details|Ketone}}
There are two methods for making ketones. The first one consists on thermally converting calcium carboxylate salts into the corresponding ketones. This was a common method for making acetone from [[calcium acetate]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Yeh, H. 2002. Pyrolytic decomposition of carboxylate salts. M.S. thesis&lt;/ref&gt; The other method for making ketones consists on converting the vaporized carboxylic acids on a [[catalyst|catalytic bed]] of [[zirconium oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, D. 2002. Ketonization of acetic acid. B.S. student report.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcohols==
{{Details|Alcohol}}

===Primary alcohols===

The undigested residue from the fermentation may be used in [[gasification]] to make [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). This H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can then be used to [[hydrogenolysis|hydrogenolyze]] the [[esters]] over a catalyst (e.g., copper chromite),&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, M.W., Harris, N., Turner, K. 1982. Process for Hydrogenolysis of Carboxylic Acid Esters WO 82/03854, Nov. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which are produced by esterifying either the ammonium carboxylate salts (e.g., [[ammonium acetate]], propionate, butyrate) or the carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, butyric acid) with a high-molecular-weight alcohol (e.g., [[hexanol]], [[heptanol (disambiguation)|heptanol]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jacsat/1951/73/i11/f-pdf/f_ja01155a075.pdf?sessid=6006l3 Preparation of esters by reaction of ammonium salts with alcohols.]&lt;/ref&gt; From the hydrogenolysis, the final products are the high-molecular-weight alcohol, which is recycled back to the [[esterification]], and the corresponding primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, butanol).

===Secondary alcohols===

The secondary alcohols (e.g., isopropanol, 2-butanol, 3-pentanol) are obtained by [[hydrogenation|hydrogenating]] over a catalyst (e.g., Raney nickel) the corresponding ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone).&lt;ref&gt;Aldrett-Lee, S. 2000. Catalytic hydrogenation of liquid ketones with emphasis on gas–liquid mass transfer. PhD dissertation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drop-in biofuels==
The primary or secondary alcohols obtained as described above may undergo conversion to drop-in [[biofuels]], fuels which are compatible with current fossil fuel infrastructure such as [[biogasoline]], [[green diesel]] and bio-jet fuel.  Such is done by subjecting the alcohols to dehydration followed by oligomerization using zeolite catalysts in a manner similar to the [[methanex]] process, which used to produce gasoline from [[methanol]] in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/energy/7D.pdf |title=Production of gasoline from methanol. |access-date=27 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201041305/http://nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/energy/7D.pdf |archive-date=1 December 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acetic acid versus ethanol==

Cellulosic-ethanol manufacturing plants are bound to be net exporters of electricity because a large portion of the [[lignocellulosic biomass]], namely [[lignin]], remains undigested and it must be burned, thus producing electricity for the plant and excess electricity for the grid.  As the market grows and this technology becomes more widespread, coupling the liquid fuel and the [[electricity market]]s will become more and more difficult.{{fact|date=October 2014}}

Acetic acid, unlike ethanol, is biologically produced from simple sugars without the production of [[carbon dioxide]]:

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 10%; border: 1px solid"&gt;
C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; → &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;center&gt;(Biological production of ethanol)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 10%; border: 1px solid"&gt;
C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; → &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH &lt;center&gt;(Biological production of [[acetic acid]])&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Because of this, on a mass basis, the yields will be higher than in ethanol fermentation. If then, the undigested residue (mostly lignin) is used to produce hydrogen by gasification, it is ensured that more energy from the biomass will end up as liquid fuels rather than excess heat/electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/841137-u4bFGI/841137.PDF Eggeman, T., Verser, D., and Weber, E. (2005), An Indirect Route for Ethanol Production US Department of Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 10%; border: 1px solid"&gt;
  3 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; → &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;center&gt;(Hydrogenation of acetic acid)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 10%; border: 1px solid"&gt;
C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (from [[cellulose]]) &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (from lignin)  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; → &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;center&gt;(Overall reaction)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A more comprehensive description of the economics of each of the fuels is given on the pages [[alcohol fuel]] and [[ethanol fuel]], more information about the economics of various systems can be found on the central page [[biofuel]].

==Stage of development==
The system has been in development since 1991, moving from the laboratory scale (10 g/day) to the pilot scale (200&amp;nbsp;lb/day) in 2001. A small demonstration-scale plant (5 ton/day) has been constructed and is under operation and a 220 ton/day demonstration plant is expected in 2012.

==Recording mechanisms ==
===HTL (high to low)===
"Normal" BD-R discs use a phase-changing alloy or a composite that decreases the reflectivity on recording, i.e. "High To Low".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Not all Blu-ray discs are created equal, but does BD-R quality matter?|website=Digistor Blog|url=http://blog.digistor.com/not-all-blu-ray-discs-are-created-equal-but-does-bd-r-quality-matter/|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sony]], for example, uses an inorganic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recording/Playback Mechanism and Recording Materials|url=https://www.sony.net/Products/Media/dvdmedia/Accucore/Blu-ray/outline/index_05.html|website=Sony Global|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; composite that splits into two [[wikt:laminar|laminar]] components with low reflectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recording/Playback Mechanism(-R) “Laminar Phase Separation”|url=https://www.sony.net/Products/Media/dvdmedia/Accucore/Blu-ray/outline/index_06.html|website=Sony Global|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composites used may include [[bismuth nitride|BiN]], [[germanium nitride|Ge&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[palladium|Pd]]-doped [[tellurium suboxide]]. A pair of layers with copper alloy and silicon that combines on recording may alternatively be used.&lt;ref name=Hugh&gt;{{cite web|title=14. Disc Construction and Manufacturing|url=http://www.hughsnews.ca/faqs/authoritative-blu-ray-disc-bd-faq/14-disc-construction-and-manufacturing|website=Hugh's News BD FAQ|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to [[CD-RW]] and [[DVD-RW]], a [[phase transition]] alloy (often [[GeSbTe|GeTeSb]] or [[AgInSbTe|InAgTeSb]])&lt;ref name=Hugh/&gt; is used for BD-RE discs. Melting the material with a very high power beam turns it into an [[amorphous]] state with low reflectivity, while heating at a lower power erases it back to a crystaline state with high reflectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recording Mechanism (-RE) “Phase-change material”|url=https://www.sony.net/Products/Media/dvdmedia/Accucore/Blu-ray/outline/index_07.html|website=Sony Global|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both cases, the data layers are surrounded by a pair of dielectric layers. An adhesive spacer layer and sometimes a semi-reflective layer is used for multi-layer discs.&lt;ref name=Hugh/&gt;

===BD-R LTH (low to high)===
'''BD-R LTH''' is a write-once Blu-ray Disc format that features an [[CD-R#dyes|organic dye recording layer]]. "Low To High" refers to the reflectivity changing from low to high during the burning process, which is the opposite of normal Blu-rays, whose reflectivity changes from high to low during writing. The advantage of BD-R LTH is it can protect a manufacturer's investment in [[DVD-R]]/[[CD-R]] manufacturing equipment because it does not require investing in new production lines and manufacturing equipment. The manufacturer only needs to modify current equipment; it doesn't need to invest in new production lines and equipment. This is expected to lower the cost of disc manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=21422 | title = Pioneer and Mitsubishi Develop Low cost BD-R Discs Using Organic Recording Layers | publisher = CDR info}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Old Blu-ray players and recorders cannot utilize BD-R LTH; however, a firmware upgrade can enable devices to access BD-R LTH. [[Panasonic]] released such a firmware update in November 2007 for its DMR-BW200, DMR-BR100 and MR-BW900/BW800/BW700 models.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=21913 | title = Firmware Adds Support for LTH BD-R Discs to Panasonic Recorders | publisher = CDR info}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneer was expected to ship the first LTH BD drives in Spring 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=22521 | title = Taiyo Yuden, Mitsubishi and Maxell Release First LTH BD-R Discs | publisher = CDR info}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sony upgraded the [[PlayStation 3]] firmware enabling BD-R LTH reading in March, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/13371.cfm | title = PS3 firmware update v2.20 available – added support for LTH BD-R | publisher = After Dawn}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, France's Ministry of Culture and Communication conducted a study on the suitability of data archival of LTH (low to high) discs compared to HTL (high to low) discs. The data they collected indicated that the overall quality of LTH discs is worse than HTL discs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myce.com/news/french-research-avoid-blu-ray-lth-discs-for-data-archival-64265/ French research: Avoid Blu-ray LTH discs for data archival]. myce.

[[Image:Larks tongue.JPG|thumb|right|A chamfer with a lark's tongue finish]]

A '''chamfer''' {{IPAc-en|'|tʃ|æ|m|.|f|ər}} is a transitional edge between two faces of an object.  A form of [[bevel]], it is created at a 45° angle to two adjoining right-angled faces.  A '''lark's tongue''' is a chamfer which ends short of a piece in a gradual upward curve, leaving the balance as a right angle.  Chamfers may be formed in either inside or outside adjoining faces of an object or room.  They are also used to "ease" otherwise sharp edges, both for safety and to prevent damage to them.

By comparison, a ''[[fillet (mechanics)|fillet]]''{{efn|Pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ|l|ᵻ|t}} {{respell|FIL|ət}}, like "fill it"}} is the rounding-off of an interior corner, and a "round" (or "radius") the rounding of an outside one.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen et al., "Engineering Drawing and Design" page 179. Delmar, 2004 {{ISBN|0-7668-1634-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chamfers are commonly employed in [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[manufacturing engineering]], and in poured-in-place [[formwork|concrete formwork]]. They are used in furniture such as counters and table tops to ease their edges; when the edges are rounded instead they are called [[bullnose]]d.  Special tools such as [[chamfer mill]]s and [[chamfer plane]]s are used. 

Chamfers are necessary in parabolic glass mirror manufacture{{cn|date=October 2017}} and desirable in certain [[printed circuit boards]].

==Architecture==
Chamfers are commonly used in architecture, both for functional and aesthetic reasons.  The base of the [[Taj Mahal]] is a [[cube]] with chamfered corners, thereby creating an [[octagon]]al architectural footprint.  Its great gate is formed of chamfered base stones and chamfered [[corbel]]s for a balcony or equivalent [[cornice (architecture)|cornice]] towards the roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tajmahal.gov.in/interior_decoration.html

|publisher=Government of UP, Uttar Pradesh
|accessdate=2014-04-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[city block]]s in [[Barcelona, Spain|Barcelona]], [[València]] and various other cities in [[Spain]], and street corners ([[Curb (road)|curb]]s) in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]], are chamfered. The chamfering was designed as an embellishment and a modernization of urban space in [[Barcelona]]'s mid-19th century [[Eixample]] or Expansion District, where the buildings follow the chamfering of the sidewalks and streets. This pioneering design opens up broader perspectives, provides pleasant pedestrian areas and allows for greater visibility while turning. It might also be considered to allow for turning to be somewhat more comfortable as, supposedly, drivers would not need to slow down as much when making a turn as they would have to if the corner were a square 90 degrees,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} though in Barcelona, most chamfered corners are used as parking spaces or loading-unloading zones, leaving the traffic to run as in normal 90-degree street corners.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Other uses==
===In parabolic glass mirror design===
Outside of aesthetics, chamfering is part of the process of hand-crafting a parabolic glass telescope mirror.&lt;ref name="IUCAA SciPOP"&gt;{{cite web | title=How to Build a Telescope ? | website=[[IUCAA]] SciPOP | url=http://scipop.iucaa.in/Literature/hbt1/hbt-welcome.html | access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the surface of the disc can be ground, the edges must first be chamfered to prevent chipping. This can be accomplished by placing the disc in a metal bowl containing [[silicon carbide]] and rotating the disc with a rocking motion. The grit will thus wear off the sharp edge of the glass.{{Citation needed|reason=At minimum, domain of the above warrants xref to mirror mfg (and many other) fab techniues where edge chipping is problematic.|date=March 2017}}

===In printed circuit board (PCB) design===
[[Image:PCBChamfer.PNG|thumb|right|Right angled and chamfered intersections of a PCB track]]
In [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) designing, a chamfer may be applied to a right-angled edge of a conductive junction in order to strengthen that location. Chamfering of junctions may also be applied in high-frequency PCB design in order to reduce reflections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bogatin|first1=Eric|title=When to worry about trace corners: Rule of Thumb #24|url=http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/all-aboard-/4438573/When-to-worry-about-trace-corners--Rule-of-Thumb--24|website=EDN Network|publisher=UBM Canon|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cured fish''' refers to fish which has been [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] by subjecting it to [[Fermented fish|fermentation]], [[pickling]], [[Smoked fish|smoking]], or some combination of these before it is eaten. These [[food preservation]] processes can include adding [[edible salt|salt]], [[nitrate]]s, [[nitrite]]&lt;ref name="uog"&gt;[http://www.uga.edu/nchfp/publications/nchfp/factsheets/food_pres_hist.html "Historical Origins of Food Preservation."] [http://www.uga.edu/nchfp University of Georgia, National Center for Home Food Preservation]. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[sugar]], can involve [[smoking (food)|smoking]] and [[seasoning|flavoring]] the fish, and may include [[cooking]] it. The earliest form of curing fish was [[Drying (food)|dehydration]].&lt;ref name="uog"/&gt; Other methods, such as [[Smoked fish|smoking fish]] or [[Salted fish|salt-curing]] also go back for thousands of years. The term "cure" is derived from the Latin ''curare'', meaning ''to take care of''. It was first recorded in reference to fish in 1743.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cure "Cure"] ''Online Etymology Dictionary''. Retrieved 23 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Binkerd and Kolari (1975), the practice of preserving meat by salting it originated in Asian deserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Binkerd | first1 = E. F. | last2 = Kolari | first2 = O. E. | doi = 10.1016/0015-6264(75)90157-1 | title = The history and use of nitrate and nitrite in the curing of meat | journal = Food and Cosmetics Toxicology | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 655–661 | year = 1975 | pmid =  1107192| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Saline salts from this area contained impurities such as nitrates that contributed to the characteristic red colour of cured meats. As early as 3,000 BC in Mesopotamia, cooked meats and fish were preserved in sesame oil and dried salted meat and fish were part of the Sumerian diet. Salt from the Dead Sea was in use by Jewish inhabitants around 1,600 BC, and by 1,200 BC, the Phoenicians were trading salted fish in the Eastern Mediterranean region. By 900 BC, salt was being produced in "salt gardens" in Greece and dry salt  curing and smoking of meat were well established. The Romans (200 BC) acquired curing procedures from the Greeks and further developed methods to "pickle" various kinds of meats in a brine marinade. It was during this time that the reddening effect of salting was noted. [[Saltpeter]] (potassium nitrate) is mentioned as being gathered in China and India prior to the Christian era for use in meat curing... In Medieval times, the application of salt and saltpeter as curing ingredients was commonplace and the reddening effect on meat was attributed to saltpeter."&lt;ref name="books.google.co.nz"/&gt;

==Salt curing==
[[File:Curingsalmon.jpg|thumb|right|Salmon prepared for curing]]
{{See also|Salted fish}}

Salt ([[sodium chloride]]) is a primary ingredient used to cure fish and other foods.&lt;ref name="ANSI-3994"&gt;{{cite report|last=Ray|first=Frederick K.|title=Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service|url=http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-2055/ANSI-3994web.pdf|accessdate=15 December 2010|publisher=Oklahoma State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal of water and addition of salt to fish creates a [[solvent|solute]]-rich environment where [[osmotic pressure]] draws water out of microorganisms, retarding their growth.&lt;ref name=ANSI-3994 /&gt;&lt;ref name="mnstate-notes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Curing and Brining (food preservation)|url=http://www.mnstate.edu/provost/BCBT100%20Curing%20and%20Brining.pdf|work=Science of Cooking|publisher=Minnesota State University|accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doing this requires a concentration of salt of nearly 20%.&lt;ref name="mnstate-notes" /&gt; Iodized table salt may be used, but the iodine generally causes a dark end product and a bitter taste. Non-iodized salts like those used for canning and pickling foods and sea salt are the preferred types of salt to use for curing meats.

==Sugar curing==

[[Sugar]] is sometimes added when curing fish, particularly [[salmon]]. The sugar can take many forms, including [[honey]], [[corn syrup]] solids, and [[maple syrup]].&lt;ref name="IL-state-additives"&gt;{{cite web|title=Additives Used in Meat|url=http://labs.ansci.illinois.edu/meatscience/Library/additives.htm|work=Meat Science|publisher=Illinois State University|accessdate=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding sugar alleviates the harsh flavor of the salt.&lt;ref name=ANSI-3994 /&gt; It also contributes to the growth of beneficial bacteria like ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' by feeding them.&lt;ref name="edinformatics"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Curing?|url=http://www.edinformatics.com/math_science/science_of_cooking/curing_foods.htm|work=Science of Cooking|publisher=EDinformatics|accessdate=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nitrates and nitrites==
[[Nitrate]]s and [[nitrite]]s have been used for hundreds of years to prevent botulism in fish and ensure [[microbial]] safety. Nitrates help kill bacteria, produce a characteristic flavor, and give fish a pink or red color.&lt;ref name="Edinformatics" /&gt; The use of nitrates in food preservation is controversial.  This is due to the potential for the formation of [[nitrosamine]]s when the preserved food is cooked at high temperature.&lt;ref name="Edinformatics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edinformatics.com/math_science/science_of_cooking/curing_foods.htm|title=Curing Food|publisher=Edinformatics|accessdate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the production of carcinogenic nitrosamines can be potently inhibited by the use of the antioxidants Vitamin C and the alpha-tocopherol form of Vitamin E during curing. A 2007 study by [[Columbia University]] suggests a link between eating cured meats and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]. [[Nitrites]] were posited as a possible cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6560121.stm |title=Health &amp;#124; Too much bacon 'bad for lungs' |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-04-17 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of either compound is carefully regulated.&lt;ref name="Edinformatics" /&gt; For example, the FDA [[Code of Federal Regulations]] states that sodium nitrite may be safely used: "As a color fixative in smoked cured [[tuna]]fish products so that the level of sodium nitrite does not exceed 10 parts per million (0.001 percent) in the finished product... As a preservative and color fixative, with or without [[sodium nitrate]], in smoked, cured [[sablefish]], smoked, cured [[salmon]], and smoked, cured [[shad]] so that the level of sodium nitrite does not exceed 200 parts per million and the level of sodium nitrate does not exceed 500 parts per million in the finished product."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=172.175 Food Preservatives: Sodium nitrite] ''FDA: Code of Federal Regulations'',
'''21''' (3): 21CFR172.175. Revised 1 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smoking==
{{Main|Smoked fish}}

Fish can also be preserved by smoking, which is drying the fish with [[smoke]] from burning or smoldering plant materials, usually [[wood]]. Smoking helps seal the outer layer of the food being cured, making it more difficult for [[bacteria]] to enter. It can be done in combination with other curing methods such as salting. Common smoking styles include hot smoking, smoke roasting and cold smoking.  Smoke roasting and hot smoking cook the fish while cold smoking does not. If the fish is cold smoked, it should be dried quickly to limit bacterial growth during the critical period where the fish is not yet dry. This can be achieved by drying thin slices of fish.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3618">'''Direct Imports'''  are products imported directly into a country and not through the manufacturer's authorized agent/distributor.  Since there is no factory-authorized middleman involved in the import of these products, the [[added cost]]s are lower and the customer pays less. In addition, many items that are in short supply or are not imported at all by the manufacturer's authorized distributors can be procured as direct imports. There is no difference in the actual products. In most cases, they are manufactured in the same place by the same people and with the same materials. Occasionally, manufacturers will give them a different name.

It is perfectly legal to [[Grey market|directly import and sell]] such products. The only caveat is that since they are not procured from a local factory-authorized middleman, the  manufacturer's warranty may not be applicable.  This type of business is fairly recent and follows the trends of the [[global economy]].

In rapidly growing developing economies like [[Economy of India|India]] where the demand for international consumer products is growing much faster than in-country supply from authorized distributors, direct imports become the only way for consumers to procure a large set of products (especially [[long tail]]). In many cases, even if a particular product is available from an authorized middle-man, a direct import may cost much less since in-country middlemen use their exclusive territorial rights to price products much higher than in the country of origin. Perversely, in countries where such product and price arbitrage is the most obvious, the import process is typically very onerous and not easily navigated by the average consumer leaving the field open to [[predatory pricing]] from in-country middlemen.

== Disintermediation by Technology ==
To help bridge this gap, a new breed of [[E-commerce]] companies acting as direct import facilitators have developed sophisticated [[E-commerce]] and [[supply chain|Supply Chain]] technology to create a cross-border supply chain that allows consumers to [[Online shopping|shop online]] for international products and have them [[Delivered Duty Paid|delivered duty paid]] to their doorstep. The entire procurement, [[international shipping]] and [[import]] process is handled turnkey by the e-commerce providers and the consumer transaction is a simple online purchase.

This is a significant example of how [[Internet]] technology is a powerful force for [[disintermediation]] in commerce.  To illustrate, a typical B2C supply chain involving imports is composed of five entities (in order):
#Foreign Supplier/Manufacturer
#In-country Importer
#In-country Distributor
#In-country Retailer (online or offline)
#In-country Buyer

With the advent of online direct imports that leverage the Internet, the supply chain is reduced to three entities:
#Foreign Supplier/Manufacturer
#Online Direct Import Facilitator
#In-country Buyer

As always, the removal of [[intermediaries]] in a supply chain i.e. "cutting out the middleman" results in high market transparency and efficient pricing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7441">__NOTOC__
The [[General Electric|GE]] '''Elec-Trak''' was the first commercially produced [[electric vehicle|all-electric]] [[garden tractor]], made mostly between 1969 and 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Will, pgs 81-83.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite their limited production and availability, many Elec-Traks are still in use today&lt;ref&gt;http://elec-trak.org/ The Elec-Trak owner's club&lt;/ref&gt; and have a cult following among [[tractor]] and [[electric vehicle]] enthusiasts.&lt;ref name=econogics&gt;[http://www.econogics.com/ev/evtools.htm#General%20Electric%20Elec-Trak Daryl McMahon, www.econogics.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  They are an archetypal or seminal design that has influenced all later electric tractors.

Several models were produced, including: the E8M and ER8-36 (8&amp;nbsp;hp); the E10M (10&amp;nbsp;hp); the E12 and E12M (12&amp;nbsp;hp); the E12S and E15 (14&amp;nbsp;hp); the E16 (an upgraded version of the E15), and the E20 (16&amp;nbsp;hp). GE's claimed horsepower figures were false; the table below includes "real" horsepower.  The E8M and ER8-36 were styled more as ride-on mowers than tractors. The "M" suffix used on some models indicates the ability to accommodate a mid-mounted (belly) mower, and an "H" was used on some models to indicate a heavy duty, double sized battery pack.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

GE also made an industrial version of the Elec-Trak, the I-5. It was orange instead of yellow, and had fenders over the front wheels and attachment points for a roll cage and forklifts of varying heights, but was otherwise identical to the E20.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Elec-trak branded attachments included electric trimmers, edgers, chainsaws, radios, arc welders, fork lifts, front-end loaders, rotary brooms, roller aerators, lawn rollers, dump carts, large vacuums, agricultural sprayers, moldboard plows, row crop cultivators, tillers, disk harrows, sickle bar mowers, belly mowers, front-mounted rotary mowers, front or rear-mounted ganged reel mowers, lawn sweepers, electric rakes, snowblowers, snowplows, golf bag holders, double seats, 120vac rotary inverters, canopy tops, and more.&lt;ref name=econogics /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myelec-traks.com/GEZ-5338C.pdf Scanned copy of 1972 Attachments and Accessories brochure]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of these attachments were connected by a 36VDC "power take off" using a [[NEMA connector|NEMA 10-50 outlet]], usually used in the U.S. for 240VAC clothes dryers and thus compatible with readily available cords in most of the USA.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

After the shutdown of production at GE, Elec-Traks were produced under the [[Wheel Horse]]&lt;ref&gt;Will, pg. 83&lt;/ref&gt; and Avco New Idea&lt;ref name=Geo&gt;George Beckett, http://www.myelec-traks.com/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sshore&gt;Steve Shore, http://www.watts-up-elec-traks.com/ge-elec-trak-history.html&lt;/ref&gt; labels.

Some time after the final shutdown of the Wheel Horse line in 1983, all remaining parts and dies were sold to Bill Gunn,&lt;ref name=GunnMemo&gt;[http://www.myelec-traks.com/9-8-87.pdf Scanned copy of letter directing customers to Bill Gunn]&lt;/ref&gt; a dealer in Edgerton, Wisconsin.  Eventually Gunn retired and all remaining stock was sold to Jim Coate of the Electric Tractor Store.&lt;ref name=Geo /&gt;&lt;ref name=sshore /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1692">The '''flame speed''' is the measured rate of expansion of the [[flame front]] in a [[combustion]] reaction. Whereas ''flame velocity'' is generally used for a [[fuel]], a related term is [[explosive velocity]], which is the same relationship measured for an [[explosive]]. Combustion [[engineer]]s differentiate between the [[laminar flame speed]] and [[turbulent]] flame speed. Flame speed is typically measured in m/s, cm/s, etc.

==In engines==
In an [[internal combustion engine]], the flame speed of a [[fuel]] is a property which determines its ability to undergo controlled combustion without [[detonation]]. Flame speed is used along with [[adiabatic flame temperature]] to help determine the engine's efficiency. According to one source,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...high flame-speed combustion processes, which closely approximate constant-volume processes, should reflect in high efficiencies.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;''NASA Technical Note'', May 1977, "[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19770016170_1977016170.pdf Emissions and Total Energy Consumption of a Multicylinder Piston Engine Running on Gasoline and a Hydrogen-Gasoline Mixture]"&lt;/ref&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The flame speeds are not the actual engine flame speeds, A 12:1 compression ratio gasoline engine at 1500 rpm would have a flame speed of about 16.5 m/s, and a similar hydrogen engine yields 48.3 m/s, but such engine flame speeds are also very dependent on stoichiometry&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faqs.org/faqs/autos/gasoline-faq/part3/section-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GE Energy''' was a [[Division (business)|division]] of [[General Electric]] and was headquartered in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ge.com/pdf/company/ge_organization_chart.pdf GE Company Organization Chart] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215135507/http://www.ge.com/pdf/company/ge_organization_chart.pdf |date=2010-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a company-wide reorganization prompted by financial losses led to the unit's formation from companies within GE Infrastructure division.

On March 29, 2011, GE Energy announced plans to acquire a 90% stake in [[Converteam]] for $3.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110329-710215.html |title=GE Energy To Buy 90% Stake In Converteam For $3.2B |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=29 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407040545/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110329-710215.html |archivedate=April 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-29/ge-to-buy-most-of-converteam-from-barclays-lbo-france-for-3-2-billion.html| title=General Electric Agrees to Buy Converteam for $3.2 Billion| publisher=[[Bloomberg Business]]|date=2011-03-29|accessdate=2015-10-29|first1= Rachel |last1=Layne |website=Bloomberg Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013–present===
After lengthy negotiations, on 2 November 2015 GE finalised the acquisition of [[Alstom]]'s power generation and electricity transmission business, that were integrated into GE Power &amp; Water. Later, the newly acquired Hydro and Wind business of Alstom, together with GE's own Wind Energy division, were spun-off to create a new subsidiary called '''[[GE Renewable Energy]]'''.

Forced by a wave of very negative financial results, the company went through a series of disinvestments and reorganization in 2017.

In May 2017, GE Oil &amp; Gas was combined with Baker Hughes Incorporated to create '''Baker Hughes, a GE company''' (BHGE), a new tier-1 business inside the parent group.

In June 2017, GE Energy Connections merged again with GE Power &amp; Water, to become the present '''GE Power'''. The new combined business unit is led by former GE Energy Connections president and CEO, Russell Stokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genewsroom.com/press-releases/russell-stokes-named-president-and-ceo-ge-power-283838|title=Russell Stokes named President and CEO of GE Power|author=|date=14 June 2017|website=genewsroom.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss-based [[ABB Group]] announced in September 2017 a $2.6 billion deal with GE Power to acquire the Industrial Solutions division.

In October 2017, GE Power sold its Water &amp; Process Technology division to French-based utility company [[Suez Environnement|Suez]] for a total of $3.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.powermag.com/ge-power-sells-lucrative-water-process-technologies-division-to-suez-in-3-4b-deal/|title=GE Power Sells Lucrative Water &amp; Process Technologies Division to SUEZ in $3.4B Deal|date=2017-10-02|work=POWER Magazine|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 2018, the private equity firm [[Advent International]] agreed to buy GE’s distributed power unit for $3.25 billion.  GE had put the unit, which makes Jenbacher and Waukesha brand reciprocating gas engines, up for sale as part of a three-year plan to exit about $20 billion in industrial assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-general-electric-jenbacher/advent-takes-over-ge-distributed-power-unit-for-3-25-billion-idUSKBN1JL1NA|date=2018-06-25|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US|title=Advent takes over GE distributed power unit for $3.25 billion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, GE Power is divided into the following divisions:

* Gas power
** [[Gas turbine#Industrial gas turbines for power generation|Gas turbines]]
** [[Heat recovery steam generator|Heat recovery steam generators]] (HRSG)
* Steam power
** [[Steam turbine|Steam turbines]]
** [[Electric generator|Generators]]

'''Geologic overpressure''' in [[stratigraphic]] layers is caused by the inability of [[connate fluids|connate pore fluids]] to escape as the surrounding mineral matrix compacts under the [[lithostatic pressure]] caused by overlying layers. Fluid escape may be impeded by sealing of the compacting rock by surrounding impermeable layers (such as [[evaporite]]s, [[chalk]] and cemented [[sandstone]]s). Alternatively, the rate of burial of the stratigraphic layer may be so great that the efflux of fluid is not sufficiently rapid to maintain [[Fluid statics|hydrostatic]] pressure.

Common situations where overpressure may occur: in a buried river channel filled with coarse sand that is sealed on all sides by impermeable shales, or when there is an explosion within a confined space.

It is extremely important to be able to diagnose overpressured units when drilling through them, as the [[drilling mud]] weight (density) must be adjusted to compensate. If it is not, there is a risk that the pressure difference down-well will cause a dramatic decompression of the overpressured layer and result in a [[blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] at the well-head with possibly disastrous consequences.
 	
Because overpressured sediments tend to exhibit better [[porosity]] than would be predicted from their depth, they often make attractive [[hydrocarbon]] reservoirs and are therefore of important economic interest.

A '''glass nail file''' is a [[nail file]] with an abrasive surface made of glass, that is used to gently grind down and shape the edges of fingernails. They are often used in manicures and pedicures after the nail has been trimmed using nail clippers.

== Origin ==
In 1997 a new technology for making glass nail files was invented in the [[Czech Republic]], using hardened [[Bohemian glass]], by Dalibor Blažek from Blažek Glass s.r.o company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Blažek|first=Dalibor|title=File, particularly nail file|date=Oct 4, 2001|url=http://www.google.com/patents/EP1138221A1|accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Blažek Glass: Glass Nail and Foot Files|url=https://www.blazek-glass.com/glass-files}}&lt;/ref&gt; The special procedure of thermal hardening resulted in advantages such as excellent shock-proofness and an extremely durable polishing surface. It had a fine-grained steady abrasive surface created by etching in a solution of acids, which allowed grinding nails without any pain or damaging the fingernail structure.

== Production technology ==

Glass nail file&amp;nbsp;— a file for fingernails care&amp;nbsp;— is made of Czech glass. In the course of manufacturing, the material is tempered using the traditional methods of Bohemian glaziers. As a result, the nail file gains a unique wear resistance. Nail files which are made of tempered glass can withstand falls onto the floor and intensive daily use. If such a nail file breaks, it is safe to touch the glass fragments.

'''Production of glass nail files is a step-by-step process'''

* Manufacture of glass sheets of particular size with smooth surface;
* Cutting nail files out of the sheets;
* Processing of the glass surface, chemical etching to obtain a fine-grained abrasive surface;
* Turning the blade edges to make it safer;
* Thermal tempering of glass to give it firmness;
* The final stages of production&amp;nbsp;— nail file decorating:
* Coloring which is fixed by the means of thermal processing;
* More complicated and refined ways of decoration&amp;nbsp;— hand painting, printing, engraving and incrustation with crystals;

== Types and sizes ==

Dimensions of the glass nail files can also be different - from the smallest (length 70&amp;nbsp;mm, thickness 2&amp;nbsp;mm) to the largest (length 195&amp;nbsp;mm, 3–6&amp;nbsp;mm thick).

Types and sizes of a glass nail file: Glass nail files of the largest sizes are used, as a rule, for pedicures. Some also produced with special glass for daily use, of for example, masters in beauty salons. Such nail files have only one working side, so as not to injure the manicure masters' finger skin.

== Distinctive features ==

Mild care: Due to the granular surface the glass nail file doesn't injure fingernails during manicure, grinding them softly and smoothly. With continuous use with such a nail file, the fingernails become stronger and cease to stratify.

Hygiene: A glass nail file is quickly and easily disinfected. It is enough to wash it in warm water with soap.
With frequent use of this manicure tool, such as in beauty salons, the nail files undergo a process of boiling for additional cleaning, where neither the tool nor its decor are damaged.

Unique wear resistance: the granular surface of a glass nail file isn't erased even if used for several years.
The depth of the working surface's relief decreases much more slowly than with equivalent use of a metal nail file.

Density: Hardened bohemian glass is known for its durability.

The '''Hardware Information Navigational Tool''', or '''HINT''', is an information web service developed by the former AG Communications Systems (now [[Alcatel-Lucent]]) which displays hardware and software characteristics of a [[telephone exchange|central office]] switching system.  It displays the hardware equipment as it is positioned in the central office and shows how this equipment is being used.  The program displays an interactive map, allowing the user to select the applicable states/provinces or country, then select the switching system, and then finally the module, circuit pack, and circuit.  The statistical reports allow customers to maintain a watch on their resources. It is also useful for engineering and the daunting task of assigning all of the various telephony services.

All [[telephone exchange]]s are customized to local conditions.  Because of this, there exists a dynamic difference between one central office to another due to capacity, provided features, and hardware vintages.  HINT started out as an internal resource used by [[GTD-5 EAX]] Engineering Services, Remote Technical Assistance, and Sales Support.  It was created with the intent to accurately view a customer’s unique hardware configuration without physically being present at the site.  Deciphering the switch’s own Office Dependent Data (ODD), it provided switching system hardware images that were accurate and up-to-date.  Through internal feedback and subsequent modifications, it evolved into a tool that was viable enough to be offered as a product and sought after by customers.

Due to the similarities between the GTD-5 EAX and the [[5ESS]] product lines, numerous requests were made by HINT users to develop and expand the scope of HINT so that it includes the 5ESS switching system.  After hearing the same request for several years and realizing the revenue potential of adding the 5ESS, AG expanded HINT to include the 5ESS switch type, providing the same features, look, and feel that has made the GTD-5 EAX version so popular.

Presently {{When|date=February 2011}}, over 90% of GTD-5 EAX switching systems are supported and maintained by the customer using HINT.  These [[telephone company|users]] have been using the tool for several years and purchase the service as a yearly subscription subject to annual scrutiny and review.  Because of this, the vendor is continuously upgrading and adding new features to excite interest and retain its customer base.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8441">The '''International Press Telecommunications Council''' ('''IPTC'''), based in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], is a [[consortium]] of the world's major [[news agencies]], other news providers and news industry vendors and acts as the global [[List of technical standard organisations|standards body]] of the news media.

Currently more than 50 companies and organizations from the news industry are members of the IPTC, including global players like [[Associated Press]] (AP), [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP), [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] (dpa), [[BBC]], [[Getty Images]], [[Press Association]] (PA), [[Reuters]] and ''[[The New York Times]]''.

IPTC aims at simplifying the distribution of information. To achieve this technical standards are developed to improve the management and exchange of information between content providers, intermediaries and consumers.
IPTC is committed to open standards and makes all standards freely available to its members and the wider community.

The IPTC was established in 1965 by a group of news organisations including the [[European Alliance of News Agencies|Alliance Européenne des Agences de Presse]] (EANA), American Newspaper Publishers Association (then ANPA, now [[Newspaper Association of America|NAA]]), Fédération Internationale des Editeurs de Journaux (now [[World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers|WAN-IFRA]]) and the North American News Agencies (a joint committee of [[Associated Press]], [[Canadian Press]] and [[United Press International]]) to safeguard the telecommunications interests of the world's press.

== IPTC Standards ==

=== Photo metadata ===

The IPTC defined a set of [[metadata]] properties that can be applied to images, part of a broader standard developed in the early 1990s and known as the [[IPTC Information Interchange Model]] (IIM). Embedded IIM image information is often referred to as an "IPTC header". This basic set of metadata fields is branded as ''IPTC Core'', in 2008 a second set branded as ''IPTC Extension'' was developed.

The [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) has largely superseded IIM's image file header structure, but the properties of the IPTC Core are synchronized between the technical structures of XMP and IIM by a vast majority of imaging software.

Because of its nearly universal acceptance among photographers &amp;mdash; even amateurs &amp;mdash; this is by far IPTC's most widely used standard.

=== IPTC NewsML-G2-Standards Family ===
Using XML and the W3C’s model for the [[Semantic Web]], in 2008 IPTC launched a new series of standards that feature modular construction and many opportunities for embedding metadata. This allows developers to build applications that use only the parts of the IPTC NewsML-G2-Standards that are required by the customer, and that reduce programming costs by re-using XML and metadata modules. Further the NewsML-G2-Standards extend the scope of exchange formats beyond news content, they include event data and well organised information about persons, organisations, points of interest, geopolitical areas or abstract concepts.

These members of the family of standards are available now: [[NewsML-G2]], [[EventsML-G2]] and [[SportsML-G2]]. Although they have different roles within the news industry they share much of the date model and the same XML coding.

====NewsML-G2====
[[NewsML-G2]] acts as an envelope and organizer so that news providers can create single news items &amp;mdash; text, photos, video or anything else &amp;mdash; and bundle them into concise cohesive packages than can be automatically processed by web CMSs or newsroom systems. The content and relationships of the individual news items can be described using a rich set of [[metadata]].

NewsML-G2 is not a text or image mark-up format. For example, it does not contain paragraph or headline tagging. Rather, it is an envelope and organizer that does not, by itself, act as a content format.

====EventsML-G2====
[[EventsML-G2]] optimises the sharing of event information such as meetings, sports events, elections, and even rocket launches — virtually any announced activity that can be broadly classified as an "event." Using XML and metadata, EventsML-G2 allows news providers to create rich descriptions of events plus information about planned coverage, and then share that information with web sites, databases, newsrooms or other customers.

====SportsML-G2====
[[SportsML-G2]] is a convenient way to share sports statistics in a concise, unambiguous way. All major sports are supported, and certain sports that are known for rich or especially complex statistics (such as [[baseball]]) can use special add-on modules. SportsML-G2 has found wide usage outside the news industry; among the user communities are sports teams, [[fantasy sports]] leagues, sports betting firms and sports historians. SportsML-G2 is the newer sibling of [[SportsML]].

===NewsCodes===
NewsCodes is the branding of [[Controlled vocabulary|Controlled Vocabularies]] created and maintained by IPTC. A set of them can be used to classify news content - regardless of the media type - and another set is used to support the functionality of IPTC's news exchange format standards.

===NewsML 1===
[[NewsML]] 1 is an XML standard developed by the IPTC to provide a media-independent, structural enveloping framework for multi-media news. It was recently superseded by [[NewsML-G2]], although IPTC plans to support this standard as ''NewsML 1.x'' indefinitely.

===ninjs===
ninjs standardizes the representation of news in [[JSON]] - a lightweight, easy-to-parse, data interchange format. The format covers the data interchange by APIs and documents in content management systems like search engines.

==={{anchor|NITF}}NITF - News Industry Text Format===
[[News Industry Text Format]] (NITF) is an XML specification published by the IPTC that is designed to standardize the content and structure of text-based news articles.

===RightsML===
RightsML is IPTC's [[Rights Expression Language]] for news media and is based on [[ODRL]].

===rNews===
rNews is a standard for using semantic markup to annotate online news. It defines a data model for embedding machine-readable publishing metadata in web documents and a set of suggested implementations. Some properties of this standard have been adopted by [[Schema.org]] for its metadata schema.

===SportsML===
[[SportsML]] is a convenient way to share sports statistics in a concise, unambiguous way. All major sports are supported, and certain sports that are known for rich or especially complex statistics (such as [[baseball]]) can use special add-on modules. SportsML has found wide usage outside the news industry; among the user communities are sports teams, [[fantasy sports]] leagues, sports betting firms and sports historians. The newer sibling of SportsML is [[SportsML-G2]].

===IPTC 7901===
[[IPTC 7901]] is still a widely used format for plain text news, despite being 30 years old. It is a close relative of the [[Newspaper Association of America]] North American standard [[ANPA-1312]], and uses similar control and other special characters to create a file that can be used to drive computerized news editing systems, photo typesetters or even [[teleprinter]] machines.

The '''''Journal of Power Sources''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] covering all aspects of [[electrochemical energy conversion]] (like [[fuel cell]]s, [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[supercapacitor]]s, and [[Photoelectrochemical cell|photo-electrochemical cells]]). The current [[editors-in-chief]] is Stefano Passerini,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaleditorialboard.cws_home/504093/editorialboard |title=Journal of Power Sources: Editorial Board |publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2017 [[impact factor]] of 6.945 and a 5-year impact factor of 6.496.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jcr.incites.thomsonreuters.com/JCRJournalProfileAction.action?pg=JRNLPROF&amp;journalImpactFactor=6.945&amp;year=2017&amp;journalTitle=JOURNAL%20OF%20POWER%20SOURCES&amp;edition=SCIE&amp;journal=J%20POWER%20SOURCES|title=InCites|last=|first=|date=|website=jcr.incites.thomsonreuters.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Until December 2009, the journal was published in many "small" volumes which contained typically 2 issues. In the years 2010 and 2011, the journal tried to adopt the "one volume per year" convention common outside Elsevier. Starting January 2012, however, it decided to completely abandon the issue numbers and became a volume-only journal.

[[File:Mechanical-calculator-Brunsviga-15-01.jpg|thumbnail|Mechanical calculator Brunsviga 15 with removed shrouds.]]
A '''Leibniz wheel''' or '''stepped drum''' is a cylinder with a set of teeth of incremental lengths which, when coupled to a counting wheel, can be used in the calculating engine of a class of [[mechanical calculator]]s.  Invented by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] in 1673, it was used for three centuries until the advent of the [[electronic calculator]] in the mid-1970s.

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] built a machine called the [[stepped reckoner]] based on the design of the stepped drum in 1694.&lt;ref&gt;[[#IFRAH|Ifrah, p. 125 (2001)]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was made famous by [[Thomas de Colmar]] when he used it, a century and a half later, in his [[Arithmometer]], the first mass-produced calculating machine.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CHASE|Chase, p.204 (1980)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also used in the [[Curta calculator]], a very popular portable calculator introduced in the second part of the 20th century.

==Concept==
By coupling a Leibniz wheel with a counting wheel free to move up and down its length, the counting wheel can mesh with any number of teeth.

The animation on the side shows a nine-tooth Leibniz wheel coupled to a red counting wheel.  It is set to mesh with three teeth at each rotation and therefore would add or subtract 3 from the counter at each rotation.

The computing engine of an Arithmometer has a set of linked Leibniz wheels coupled to a crank handle.  Each turn of the crank handle rotates all the Leibniz wheels by one full turn.  The input sliders move counting wheels up and down the Leibniz wheels which are themselves linked by a carry mechanism.

From the late nineteenth century on, Leibniz stepped drums in purely mechanical calculators were partially supplanted by [[Pinwheel calculator|pinwheels]] which are similar in function but with a more compact design; stepped drums remained the primary technology for electromechanical calculators until the development of purely electronic calculators.

* {{flagicon|Germany}} – J.C. Schuster, Hahn's brother in law, built a few machines of Hahn's design into the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARGIN|Marguin, p.84-86 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flagicon|United Kingdom}} – [[Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] designed a machine using Leibniz wheels in 1777.  He also designed a [[pinwheel calculator]] in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;[[#FELT|Door E. Felt, p.15-16 (1916)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flagicon|Germany}} – Johann-Helfrich Müller built a machine very similar to Hahn's machine in 1783.
* {{flagicon|France}} – [[Charles Xavier Thomas|Thomas de Colmar]] invented his [[Arithmometer]] in 1820 but it took him 30 years of development before it was commercialized in 1851. It was manufactured until 1915. Louis Payen, {{nowrap|Veuve L. Payen}} and Darras were successive owners and distributors of the Arithmometer.
* {{flagicon|France}} – Timoleon Maurel invented his [[Arithmaurel]] in 1842. The complexity of its design limited its capacity and doomed its production, but it could multiply two numbers by the simple fact of setting them on its dials.
* {{flagicon|Europe}} – About twenty clones of the Arithmometer were manufactured in Europe starting with Burkhardt in 1878 then came Layton, Saxonia, Gräber, Peerless, Mercedes-Euklid, XxX, Archimedes, TIM, Bunzel, Austria, Tate, Madas etc. These clones, often more sophisticated than the original arithmometer, were built until the beginning of World War II.
* {{flagicon|United Kingdom}} – Joseph Edmondson invented and manufactured a circular calculator in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rechenmaschinen-illustrated.com/Edmondson.htm Pictures of the Edmonson calculator] www.rechenmaschinen-illustrated.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flagicon|United States}} – Friden and Monroe calculators used a biquinary variant of this mechanism. Both were made in large numbers; Monroe started early in the 20th century; Friden in the 1930s. (The Marchant used a radically different and unique mechanism.)  The variant mechanism worked with digits from 1 through 4 as shown in the animation; digits larger than 4 engaged a five-tooth gear as well as the teeth of the Leibniz wheel. This made it unnecessary for the sliding gear to travel longer distances for the higher-number digits. Otherwise, pressing a 5..9 key would require either a longer stroke (as in a Comptometer) or excessive force combined with a gently sloping cam surface.
* {{flagicon|Austria}} – [[Curt Herzstark]] introduced his [[Curta Calculator|Curta]] portable calculator in 1948, which remained popular until the introduction of electronic calculators in the 1970s.

[[File:Lombard steam log hauler.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A restored Lombard steam log hauler at [[Clark's Trading Post]] in [[Lincoln, New Hampshire]]]]
The '''Lombard Steam Log Hauler''', patented 21 May 1901, was the first successful commercial application of a continuous track for vehicle propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;Alvin O. Lombard, Logging Engine, {{US patent|674737}}, granted May 21, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alvin O. Lombard, Log Hauler, {{US patent|854364}}, granted May 21, 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auman"&gt;Auman (1984) p.99&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was later used for military [[tank]]s during [[World War I]] and for agricultural tractors and construction equipment following the war.

==Description==
[[Alvin Orlando Lombard]] was a blacksmith building [[logging]] equipment in [[Waterville, Maine]]. He built 83 steam log haulers between 1901 and 1917.&lt;ref name="Auman_a"&gt;Auman (1984) p.100&lt;/ref&gt; These log haulers resembled a [[Tank locomotive#Saddle tank|saddle-tank]] [[steam locomotive]] with a small platform in front of the boiler where the [[pilot (locomotive)|cow-catcher]] might be expected. A steering wheel on the platform moved a large pair of [[ski]]s beneath the platform. A set of [[Continuous track|tracked vehicle]] treads occupied the space beneath the boiler where [[driving wheel]]s might be expected. The locomotive [[cylinder (locomotive)|cylinders]] powered the treads through a [[gear]] train. The log haulers mechanically resembled 10- to 30-ton [[snowmobile]]s with a top speed of about {{convert|4.5|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook (1961) pp.77-80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
While the ground was covered with snow and ice, a log hauler could tow a string of [[sled]]s filled with logs. Each sled train required a crew of four men. An [[railroad engineer|engineer]] and [[fireman (steam engine)|fireman]] occupied the cab behind the boiler, and a steersman sat on the platform in front. A [[conductor (rail)|conductor]] rode on the sleds with a bell-rope or wire to signal the crew in the cab.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook (1961) p.78&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest log haulers pulled three sleds, and later models were designed to pull eight sleds. Each train carried 40,000 to 100,000 [[board foot|board-feet]] of logs. The record train length was said to be 24 sleds with a total length of {{convert|1650|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Auman_a" /&gt;

The greatest operational difficulty was on downhill grades where ice allowed the sleds to accelerate faster than the engine. Jack-knifing sleds pushed many log haulers into trees, and most photos of log haulers show rebuilt cabs and bent ironwork on the boiler and saddle tank. [[Hay]] was spread over the downhill routes in an effort to increase friction under the sleds, but hungry deer sometimes consumed the hay before the train arrived.

The steersman was regarded as the hero of the crew. In sub-freezing temperatures down to 40 degrees below zero, he sat in an exposed position in front of the train. Sparks flying out of the boiler stack above him would sometimes set his clothing afire as avoidance of trees required his full attention and effort turning the clumsy steering wheel. Some steersmen earned enough money to purchase fire-resistant leather clothing. Some log haulers had a small roofed shelter built on the steering platform, but the shelter limited the steersman's ability to jump clear when collision became inevitable, and few were able to avoid injury from the following trainload of logs.

[[Brown Company#Berlin Mills Company |Berlin Mills Company]] was one of the larger woods operators to use Lombard log haulers. They purchased one machine in 1904, and then purchased two more to maintain reliable operation when one needed repairs. The company maintained a single {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=mid|-long|0}} iced haul road in [[Stetson, Maine]], by nightly application of water from a sprinkler sled, and strung a telephone line with frequent call boxes to dispatch sled trains over that road. The company estimated those three Lombard log haulers did the work of 60 horses.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook (1961) pp.78-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first two Lombard log haulers were used near [[Eustis, Maine]], in 1901 prior to construction of the [[Phillips and Rangeley Railroad#Eustis Railroad|Eustis Railroad]]. These early machines had an upright boiler and were steered by a team of horses.&lt;ref name="auman"/&gt; Most of the Lombard log haulers were used in [[Maine]] and [[New Hampshire]]. A few were used in [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]] and [[Russia]]. Lombard began building 6-cylinder [[petrol engine|gasoline]]-powered log haulers in 1914, produced a more powerful "Big 6" later, and built one [[Fairbanks-Morse]] [[Diesel engine]] hauler in 1934. The internal combustion log haulers (called Lombard tractors) were less powerful than the steam log haulers; and resembled a stake body truck on a skis and tracks chassis. The steam-powered haulers are thought to have been used as late as 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook (1961) p.79&lt;/ref&gt; At least ten of the Lombard tractors were preserved at [[Eagle Lake (Maine)#Churchill Lake Dam|Churchill Depot]] as recently as the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strout |first=W. Jerome |authorlink = |title =75 Years The Bangor and Aroostook |publisher =[[Bangor and Aroostook Railroad]]  |volume = |edition = |date =1966 |location =[[Bangor, Maine]] |page =45 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Antarctic [[Mount Lombard]] was named in recognition of the Lombard Log Hauler as the first application of knowledge of snow mechanics to trafficability.&lt;ref name=gnis&gt;{{cite gnis | type = antarid | id = 8977| name = Mount Lombard | accessdate = 2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lombard Steam Log Hauler was designated a [[List of Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks|National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark]] in 1982 following nomination by the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/doc/parks/history/allagash/lombards/brochure.pdf|title=The Lombard Log Hauler A National Historic Engineering Landmark|publisher=State of Maine|accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nanoreactors''' are a form of [[chemical reactor]] that are particularly in the disciplines of [[nanotechnology]] and [[nanobiotechnology]]. These special reactors are crucial in maintaining a working [[nanofoundry]]; which is essentially a [[foundry]] that manufactures products on a nanotechnological scale.

==Summary==
===General information===
Researchers in the [[Netherlands]] have succeeded in building nanoreactors that can perform one-pot multistep reactions - the next step towards artificial [[Cell (biology)|cell]]-like devices in addition for applications involving the [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] and [[diagnosis]] of a disease or illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/spotid=3066.php ''Another nanotechnology example of mimicking nature: nanoreactors for one-pot multistep reactions''] at NanoWerk&lt;/ref&gt; A biochemical nanoreactor is created simply by unwrapping a [[virus|biological virus]] through scientific methods, eliminating its harmful contents, and re-assembling its protein coat around a single molecule of enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2007/September/24090702.asp ''Viral nanoreactor captures single molecules''] at RSC.org&lt;/ref&gt; The [[kinetic isotope effect]] is trapped in a single molecule within a membrane-based nanoreactor.&lt;ref name="rsc2"&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2010/September/12091001.asp ''Isotope effect seen on single molecule''] at RSC.org&lt;/ref&gt; This is a phenomenon that has been found by researchers in the [[United Kingdom]] during experiments done in September 2010.&lt;ref name="rsc2"/&gt; The kinetic isotope effect, where the rate of a reaction is influenced by the presence of an  isotopic atom in solution, is an important principle for elucidating reaction mechanisms.&lt;ref name="rsc2"/&gt; This recent finding could open up new methods to study chemical reactions.&lt;ref name="rsc2"/&gt; They may even aid in the process of creating new (and even more powerful) nanoreactors.&lt;ref name="rsc2"/&gt;

Using [[nanocrystal]]s, a scalable and inexpensive process can ultimately create nanoreactors.&lt;ref name="lbl"&gt;[http://www.lbl.gov/tt/techs/lbnl2012.html ''Hollow Nanocrystals and Nanoreactors''] at Berkeley Lab&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] in [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] have the ability to take advantage of the large difference in select components to create these nanocrystals and nanoreactors.&lt;ref name="lbl"/&gt; Nanocrystals are easier to use and less expensive than methods that employ [[sacrificial template]]s in the creation process of [[hollow particle]]s.&lt;ref name="lbl"/&gt; Catalyst particles are separated into [[Electron shell|shell]]s in order to prevent [[particle aggregation]].&lt;ref name="lbl"/&gt; Selective entry into the catalysis chamber reduces the likelihood of desired products undergoing secondary [[Chemical reaction|reaction]]s.&lt;ref name="lbl"/&gt;

Nanoreactors can also be built by controlling the positioning of two different [[enzyme]]s in the central [[Reservoir|water reservoir]] or the [[plastic]] membrane of synthetic nanoscopic bubbles.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070820112825.htm ''Nanoreactors For Reaction Cascades''] at Science Daily&lt;/ref&gt; Once the third enzyme is added into the surrounding solution, it becomes possible for three different enzymatic reactions to occur at once without interfering with each other (resulting in a "one-pot" reaction).&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"/&gt; The potential for nanoreactors can be demonstrated by binding the enzyme [[horseradish peroxidase]] into the membrane itself; trapping the enzyme [[glucose oxidase]].&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"/&gt; The surrounding solution would end up containing the enzyme [[lipase B]] with the [[glucose]] molecules containing four acetyl groups as the substrate.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"/&gt; The resulting glucose would cross the membrane, become oxidized, and the horseradish peroxidase would convert the sample substrate ABTS (2,2’-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) into its radical cation.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"/&gt;

===Abilities===
Nanoreactors can also be used to emulisfy water, create [[hydrogen fuel|hydrofuel]]s (which essentially blends 15% water into the refined diesel product), play a helpful role in the [[Chemical substance|chemical]] industry by allowing multiple streams of raw materials to exists in a single nanoreactor, manufacture personal care products (i.e., [[lotion]]s, [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|pharmaceutical cream]]s, [[shampoo]]s, [[Hair conditioner|conditioner]]s, [[shower gel]]s, [[deodorant]]s), and improve the food and beverage industries (by processing [[sauce]]s, [[purée]]s, [[cooking base]]s for soup, emulsifying [[drink|non-alcoholic beverage]]s, and [[salad dressing]]s).&lt;ref name="ctinanotech"&gt;[http://www.ctinanotech.com/technology/cti-cavitation-industry-applications ''CTI Nano Reactors Applications''] at CTI Nanotech&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal care goods can be enhanced by companies feeding multiple phases of material, using a mixing device with water, and creating instant [[emulsion]]s.&lt;ref name="ctinanotech"/&gt; These emulsions would come with smaller particles, are expected to have a longer [[shelf life]] and an give off an enhanced appearance when sold at retailers.&lt;ref name="ctinanotech"/&gt; The needs of the food and beverage industry can result in lower processing costs, more space, better efficiency, and lower equipment costs.&lt;ref name="ctinanotech"/&gt; This may bring down the cost of food and beverages for consumers; even alcoholic beverages that are subject to hidden [[Pigovian tax|sin taxes]].

Hydrofuel can be used to move heavy duty [[transport]]s, [[train]]s, earth-moving equipment (including [[bulldozer]]s), in addition to providing fuel to most [[boat]]s and [[ship]]s.&lt;ref name="ctinanotech"/&gt; Reduced pollution and increased fuel efficiency may come out of nanoreactor-produced hydrofuel.&lt;ref name="ctinanotech"/&gt; The increased usage of renewable energy may also help to improve the world's environment thanks to nanoreactors.&lt;ref name="ctinanotech"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1208">The '''National Sheep Identification System''' (NSIS) is a [[government regulation]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] for identifying [[sheep]]. It was introduced as part of the [[European Union|EU]]-wide system for the [[Animal identification|identification]] and registration of [[sheep|ovine]] and [[Goat|caprine]] animals in December 2003.  These measures were introduced following the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak]].

Under the NSIS, all sheep [[Herd|flock]] owners must be registered, all sheep must be tagged and details of all sheep on [[farm]]s and all sheep movements must be fully recorded.  This system, which encompasses [[Producer (agriculture)|producer]]s, marts, [[Slaughterhouse|meat factories]] and others, provides that Ireland has full traceability for all sheep, on an individual basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/animalhealthwelfare/animalidentificationmovement/nationalsheepidentificationsystem/ National Sheep Identification System – Department of Agriculture, Food &amp; the Marine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;They have to be tagged to be able to go to the market

'''''NearGlobal''''' is a London, UK, based software developer and publisher of Near, a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] city browser platform and virtual world technology that delivers survey-accurate models of real-world cities that users can explore and interact with from their computer.  The Near software was released in December 2009 with a public beta version incorporating the key shopping districts of London's West End.&lt;ref name="beta"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/retailing/article6851490.ece|title=West End online for a 'virtual Christmas'|publisher=The Times|accessdate=2010-07-07 | location=London | first=Fiona | last=Hamilton | date=2009-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
NearGlobal describes the Near product as a discovery platform,&lt;ref name="discovery"&gt;{{cite web|date=2010-01-07|url=http://london.nearglobal.com/Features.aspx|title=Near features|publisher=NearGlobal|accessdate=2010-07-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815060617/http://london.nearglobal.com/Features.aspx|archivedate=15 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather that a virtual world. Near allows for the seamless integration of existing web-based content into the 3D environment.

==Differentiation==
Near differs significantly from virtual worlds such as [[Second Life]], [[Twinity]] and [[Blue Mars (video game)|Blue Mars]] by focusing more on the presentation of the environment than on its users. The Near software depicts users with blades of light&lt;ref name="avatar"&gt;{{cite web|date=2009-09-28|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/941546/Liberty-M-S-sign-up-Londons-virtual-West-End/|title=Liberty and M&amp;S sign-up to London's virtual West End|publisher=Brand Republic|accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than with human avatars.

'''OpenWebNet''' is a [[communications protocol]] developed by [[Bticino]] since 2000.

The OpenWebNet protocol allows a "high-level" interaction between a remote unit and [[Bus SCS]] of MyHome [[domotic]] system. The latest protocol evolution has been improved to allow interaction with well-known home automation systems like [[KNX (standard)|KNX]] and [[DMX512-A]] system, by using appropriate [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]].

The OpenWebNet protocol is disclosed on MyOpen community.

==OpenWebNet Protocol==
The protocol is thought to be independent from the used technology. For example, it is possible to use a supervisor software connected via [[Ethernet]], via serial [[RS-232]] or via [[USB]] to a gateway that is directly connected to a domotic system.

Everyone can require protocol message extension. It is enough to propose your own [[Request for Comments|RFC]]. It will be examined and disclosed if it respects  ''OpenWebNet'' syntax.

===Syntax===
An ''OpenWebNet'' message is structured with variable length fields separated by the special character '*' and closed by '##'.

The characters admitted in the fields are numbers and the character “#”.

The structure of a message is therefore:
*field1*field2*… *fieldN##

The following fields are admitted:
WHO
WHAT
WHERE
DIMENSION
VALUE

'''WHO'''

It characterizes the domotic system function to which the OpenWebNet message is referred.

For example: WHO = 1, characterizes the messages for lighting system management.

'''WHAT'''

It characterizes an action to do or a status to read. For every WHO (and therefore for every function) there is a specific WHAT table.

The field WHAT can also contain optional parameters: WHAT#PAR1#PAR2… #PARn.

Example of actions: switch ON light, dimmer to 75%, switch DOWN shutter, radio ON, etc. 
Example of status: light ON, active alarm, battery unload, etc.

'''WHERE'''

It characterizes the set of objects to which the OpenWebNet message is referred. It can be a single object, a group of objects, a specific environment, the entire system, etc.

For every WHO (and therefore for every function) there is a specified WHERE table.

The tag WHERE can also contain optional parameters: WHERE#PAR1#PAR2… #PARn.

Example of where: all the lights of group 1, sensor 2 of zone 1 of alarm system, etc.

'''DIMENSION'''

Is a range of value that characterizes the dimension of the object to which the message is referred. For every WHO (and therefore for every function) there is a specific DIMENSION table.

It’s possible to require/to read/to write the value of one dimension.
Every dimension has a prefixed number of values, described in VALUE field.

Example of dimension: sensor temperature, loudspeaker volume, firmware version of a device, etc.

'''VALUE'''

It characterizes the read/written value of a written/required/read dimension.

===Message===
There are 4 types of OpenWebNet Message:

*Command / Status Message
*Status Request Message
*Request/Read/Write Dimension Message
*Acknowledge Message

''Command / Status Message''
 *WHO*WHAT*WHERE##

''Status Request Message''
 *#WHO*WHERE##

''Request/Read/Write Dimension Message''
Request:
 *#WHO*WHERE*DIMENSION##
Read:
 *#WHO*WHERE*DIMENSION*VALUE1*...*VALUEn##
Write:
 *#WHO*WHERE*#DIMENSION*VALUE1*...*VALUEn##

''Acknowledge Message''
ACK:
 *#*1##
NACK:
 *#*0##

==Gateway OpenWebNet==
It is possible to interact with the SCS [[home automation]] [[bus (computing)|bus]] by using a specific [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]].

There are two typologies of gateways that allow a connection to the field bus by using different [[Technical standard|standard]] [[Communications protocol|protocol]]s:
* Gateway [[Ethernet]] ([[Linux]]-based)
* Gateway [[USB]] or [[RS232]]

===Gateway Ethernet===
The current implementation by BTicino is also an [[embedded system|embedded]] [[web server]]. It works as a translator between OpenWebNet messages via TCP/IP and the SCS messages transmitted on the SCS bus.

It is possible to control three different kinds of buses:
* BUS SCS
* [[KNX (standard)|KNX]]
* [[Digital MultipleX|DMX]]

The Ethernet gateway offers two modes of authentication:
* via a list of whitelisted IPAs
* using a nonce-type password exchange (see in the external links for code)

===Gateway USB or RS232===
The gateway is an interface that works as a translator between the OpenWebNet messages transmitted on USB or serial and the SCS messages transmitted on the SCS bus.

The '''Peacock Clock''' is a large [[automaton]] featuring three life-sized mechanical birds. It was manufactured by the [[entrepreneur]] [[James Cox (inventor)|James Cox]] in the 2nd half of the 18th century and through the influence of [[Grigory Potemkin]] it was acquired by [[Catherine the Great]] in 1781. Today it is a prominent exhibit in the collections of the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. The clock is also shown daily on the Russian TV channel [[Russia-K]].

[[Image:Mallet bag.JPG|thumb|335px|Mallet bag showing variety of mallets]]

A '''percussion mallet''' or '''beater''' is an object used to strike or beat a [[percussion instrument]] in order to produce its sound.

The term ''beater'' is slightly more general; A ''mallet'' is normally held in the hand while a ''beater'' may be foot or mechanically operated, for example in a [[bass drum pedal]]; ''Drum stick'' is less general still, but still applied to a wide range of beaters. Some mallets, such as a triangle wand, are normally used only with a specific instrument, while others are used on many different instruments.

Some mallets, such as [[vibraphone]] mallets, are normally just called ''mallets'', others have more specialised names including:

* [[Drum stick]]s, of many types, some used with a wide variety of instruments,.
* [[Wand (percussion)|Wand]]s used to strike a [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]].
* [[Rute (music)|Rute]]s, used with many instruments.
* Brushes, used particularly with [[snare drum]] but also with many other instruments.
* [[Tipper (percussion)|Tipper]]s used to strike a [[bodhrán]]. 
* [[Hammer (percussion)|Hammer]]s, also just called ''mallets'' or ''dongers'',  used with a [[xylophone]].
* [[Bachi]], used with Japanese [[taiko]] drums.

==Types==

===Drum sticks===
{{main|drum stick}}

Drum sticks are beaters normally used in pairs, with each held in one hand, and are similar to or derived from the [[snare drum]] sticks that were subsequently adopted for [[kit drumming]].

They are the most general-purpose beaters, and the term covers a wide variety of beaters, but they are mainly used for untuned percussion.

===Mallets===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Crash cymbal]] --&gt;
[[Image:Model 13 yarn mallets.JPG|thumb|Yarn mallets (model 13)]]
[[Image:Timpani Mallets.JPG|thumb|Timpani Mallets]]
[[File:Cartwheel mallets.JPG|thumb|Cartwheel mallets, with wooden shafts and heads of felt held between steel washers]]
As well as being a general term for a hand-held beater, '''mallet''' is also used specifically to refer to a hand-held beater comprising a '''head''' connected to a thin shaft, and used in pairs. There are three main sorts:

* '''Unwrapped mallets''', used on [[glockenspiel]], [[xylophone]] and other instruments with  keys made of durable material, have heads made of [[brass]], [[rubber]], [[nylon]], [[acrylic resin|acrylic]], [[wood]], or other hard materials.
* '''Wrapped mallets''', mostly used on [[marimba]], [[vibraphone]] and other instruments with softer keys (though they can be used on more durable instruments as well), have heads of [[Composite material|kelon]], rubber, nylon, acrylic or other medium-hard materials wrapped in softer materials like yarn, cord or latex. Wrapped mallets are also the mallets of choice to play [[suspended cymbal]], though drum set players typically simply use drum sticks instead.
* '''[[Felt]] mallets''' or '''cartwheel mallets''' have heads composed of layers of felt, held between two steel washers. They are mainly used on untuned percussion, and in the context of [[kit drumming]] are referred to as ''soft sticks''.

Mallet shafts are commonly made of [[rattan]], [[birch]], or synthetic materials such as [[fibreglass]].

Different mallets are used primarily to alter the [[timbre]] of the mallet instrument being played. Generally, mallets composed of softer materials will stick to the instrument for longer as they bounce off of it, which gives a deeper sound made up of lower frequencies. Harder materials tend to bounce off quicker, and as they stick to the instrument for a shorter amount of time, they tend to be able to excite more of the higher frequencies, giving the sound a higher pitch with more overtones. Mallet choice is typically left up to the performer, though some compositions specify if a certain sound is desired by the composer. 

Players frequently employ two mallets in a matched grip or four mallets in a four-mallet grip; however, use of up to six mallets is not uncommon. More than two mallets may be used even when no [[Chord (music)|chord]]s are called for by the composer so that the performer has a wider range of timbres from which to select or to facilitate performance of music that moves rapidly between high and low, and if hit properly can switch between the two [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]es.

===Brushes===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ride cymbal]] --&gt;

[[Image:Spazzole-brushes.jpg|thumb|Brushes in use on a [[snare drum]]]]
Brushes are a set of bristles connected to a handle so that the bristles make a rounded fan shape. They are often used in [[jazz]] or [[blues]] music, but also in other genres such as [[rock music|rock]], [[country music|country]] and [[pop music|pop]]. The bristles can be made of metal or plastic; the handles are commonly made of wood or aluminum, and are often coated with rubber. Some brushes are telescoping so that the bristles can be pulled inside a hollow handle and the fan made by the bristles can be of variable length, width and density. Retracting the bristles also protects the brush when it is not being used. The non-bristled end of the brush may end in a loop or a ball.

===Rutes===
{{Main|Rute (music)}}
[[File:Rutes and nylon brushes.JPG|thumb|Rutes and nylon brushes: [[Pro-Mark]] Hot Rod (19 canes), Pro-Mark Lightning Rod (7 canes), Livingstone (19 canes), [[Vater Percussion|Vater]] AcouStick (7 canes plus 6 nylon strips), [[Latin Percussion|LP]] light brush partly extended, the same brush fully extended]]
A rute or multi-rod consists of several thin sticks that are bound together to form one stick. Its sound is midway between a stick and a brush.

Long used in orchestral music, in the mid 20th century rutes also became popular for many other purposes including [[kit drumming]] and [[bodhrán]].

By dissipating much of the energy of the stroke within the stick, a rute allows a drummer to achieve both a tone and a playing action that would normally be associated with quite loud playing, but at a moderate or even low volume. The tone produced by many can be adjusted by adjusting the position of one of the bands holding the bundle together.

The [[electrode]]s vary from [[copper]] or [[tungsten]] to [[hafnium]] or [[zirconium]], along with various other [[alloy]]s.  A strong electric current under high voltage passes between the two electrodes as an [[electric arc]]. Pressurized inert gas is [[Ionization|ionized]] passing through the plasma created by the arc. The torch's temperature ranges from {{convert|4000|to|25000|F|C|-2}}.&lt;ref name="recoveredenergy"&gt;

The waste is heated, melted and finally [[Vaporization|vaporized]]. Only at these extreme conditions can molecular [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] occur by breaking apart [[Covalent bond|molecular bonds]]. [[molecule|Complex molecules]] are separated into individual [[atoms]]. The resulting elemental components are in a gaseous phase ([[syngas]]).

=== Feedstocks ===
The feedstock for plasma waste treatment is most often [[municipal solid waste]], [[organic waste]], or both. Feedstocks may also include [[biomedical waste]] and [[Dangerous goods|hazmat]] materials.  Content and consistency of the waste directly impacts performance of a plasma facility. Pre-sorting and recycling useful material before gasification provides consistency. Too much inorganic material such as metal and construction waste increases slag production, which in turn decreases [[syngas]] production. However, a benefit is that the slag itself is chemically inert and safe to handle (certain materials may affect the content of the gas produced, however&lt;ref name=HSW/&gt;). Shredding waste before entering the main chamber helps to increase syngas production. This creates an efficient transfer of energy which ensures more materials are broken down.&lt;ref name=HSW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/plasma-converter.htm| title=How Stuff Works- Plasma Converter|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For improved processing steam is sometimes added into the plasma gasification process.

=== Yields ===

Pure highly calorific [[syngas|synthesis gas]] consists predominantly of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="synconversion"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inorganic compound]]s in the waste stream are not broken down but melted, which includes glass, ceramics, and various metals.

The high temperature and lack of oxygen prevents the formation of many toxic compounds such as [[furan]]s, [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]], or [[sulfur dioxide]] in the flame itself. However, dioxins are formed during cooling of the syngas.

Metals resulting from plasma [[pyrolysis]] can be recovered from the slag and eventually sold as a commodity. Inert slag produced from some processes is granulated and can be used in construction.  A portion of the syngas produced feeds on-site turbines, which power the plasma torches and thus support the feed system. This is self-sustaining electric power.&lt;ref name="synconversion"/&gt;

=== Equipment ===
Some plasma gasification reactors operate at [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]],&lt;ref name=moustakasa/&gt; but all attempt to recover both&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent

* Operational costs are high relative to that of incineration.
* Little or even negative net energy production.
* Wet feed stock results in less syngas production and higher energy consumption.
* Frequent maintenance and limited plant availability.
* For some early technologies, the plasma torch [[Plume (fluid dynamics)|plume]] reduced the diameter of the sampler orifice over time, necessitating frequent maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:Grimme SF 150-60.jpg|thumb|A modern self-propelled potato harvester]]
'''Potato harvesters''' are machines that harvest [[potato]]es. They work by lifting the potatoes from the bed using a share. Soil and crop are transferred onto a series of webs where the loose soil is sieved out.  The potatoes are moved towards the back of the harvester on to a separation unit and then (on manned machines) to a picking table where people pick out the stones, clods, and haulms by hand. The potatoes then go on to a side elevator and into a [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer]] or a potato box.

==Types==

===Potato spinner===
[[File:Old potato digger at Drumin museum. - geograph.org.uk - 258075.jpg|thumb|left|A potato spinner]]
A potato spinner is connected to a [[tractor]] through the [[three-point hitch|three-point linkage]]. Older machines were drawn by [[horse]] and were driven by a ground drive. It works by a flat piece of metal which runs horizontal to the ground lifting the [[potato]]es up and a large wheel with spokes on it called a reel pushing the [[clay]] and potatoes out to the side.  The potatoes are then gathered by hand, placed into containers and transported from the field for further packaging.

The potato spinner is becoming obsolete because modern potato harvesting equipment eliminates  manual gathering of potatoes and leaves fewer potatoes in the soil.

===Haulm topper===
[[File:Lifting potatoes near Bonby, 2011.jpg|thumb|A tractor with a front-mounted haulm topper and a trailed potato harvester]]
A '''haulm topper''' is an [[Agricultural machinery|agricultural machine]] that cuts [[potato]] stems ([[wikt:haulm|haulms]]) before potatoes are harvested.  It is like a [[flail mower]] but has the profile of the potato drills.  Modern potato farmers often mount a haulm topper on the front of the [[tractor]] and have a trailed potato harvester towed behind the tractor. Toppers can also be rear-mounted.
It is a very efficient machine.

A '''propellant''' or '''propellent''' is a [[chemical substance]] used in the [[Energy production|production of energy]] or [[pressurized gas]] that is subsequently used to create [[fluid dynamics|movement of a fluid]] or to generate [[propulsion]] of a [[vehicle]], [[projectile]], or other object. Common propellants are [[energetic materials]] and consist of a [[fuel]] like [[gasoline]], [[jet fuel]], [[rocket fuel]], and an [[oxidizer]]. Propellants are burned or otherwise decomposed to produce the [[propellant gas]].  Other propellants are simply liquids that can readily be vaporized.

In rockets and aircraft, propellants are used to produce a gas that can be directed through a nozzle, thereby producing thrust. In rockets, [[rocket propellant]] produces an exhaust, and the exhausted material is usually expelled under pressure through a [[nozzle]].  The pressure may be from a compressed gas, or a gas produced by a chemical reaction. The exhaust material may be a [[gas]], [[liquid]], [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], or, before the chemical reaction, a [[solid]], liquid, or [[gel]]. In aircraft, the propellant is usually a fuel and is combusted with the air.

In firearm ballistics, propellants fill the interior of an [[Cartridge (firearms)|ammunition cartridge]] or the chamber of a gun or cannon, leading to the expulsion of a bullet or shell ([[gunpowder]], [[smokeless powder]], and large gun propellants). [[Explosive material]] can be placed in a sealed tube and act as a deflagrant low explosive charge in mining and demolition, to produce a low velocity heave effect ([[gas pressure blasting]]).

Cold gas propellants may be used to fill an expansible bag or membrane, such as an automotive airbag (gas generator propellants) or in pressurised dispensing systems, such as aerosol sprays, to force a material through a nozzle. Examples of can propellants include [[nitrous oxide]] that is dissolved in canned [[whipped cream]], and the [[dimethyl ether]] or low-boiling [[alkane]] used in [[hair spray]].  
Rocket propellant may be expelled through an expansion nozzle as a cold gas, that is, without energetic mixing and combustion, to provide small [[delta-v|changes in velocity]] to spacecraft by the use of [[cold gas thruster]]s.

== Aerosol sprays ==
{{further|Aerosol spray#Aerosol propellants}}
In [[aerosol spray]] cans, the propellant is simply a pressurized gas in equilibrium with its liquid (at its [[saturated vapour pressure]]). As some gas escapes to expel the payload, more liquid evaporates, maintaining an even pressure.

== Used to propel solid objects ==
{{further|Rocket propellant}}
Technically, the word '''propellant''' is the general name for chemicals used to create thrust. For vehicles, the term propellant refers only to chemicals that are stored within the vehicle prior to use, and excludes atmospheric gas or other material that may be collected in operation.

Among the English-speaking layperson, used to having fuels propel vehicles on Earth, the word '''fuel''' is inappropriately{{dubious|date=January 2010}} used. In Germany, the word ''Treibstoff''—literally "drive-stuff"—is used; in France, the word ''ergols'' is used; it has the same Greek roots as [[hypergolic]], a term used in English for propellants that combust spontaneously and do not have to be set ablaze by auxiliary ignition system.

To attain a useful density for storage, most propellants are either solid or liquid.

=== Solid propellant ===
{{further|Solid fuel|Solid-fuel rocket}}
In [[ballistics]] and [[pyrotechnics]], a '''propellant''' is a generic name for chemicals used for propelling projectiles from guns and other firearms.

Solid propellants are usually made from [[low explosive|low-explosive]] materials, but may include [[high explosive|high-explosive]] chemical ingredients that are diluted and burned in a controlled way ([[deflagration]]) rather than [[detonation]].  The controlled burning of the propellant composition usually produces [[thrust]] by [[gas]] [[pressure]] and can [[accelerate]] a [[projectile]],  [[rocket]], or other vehicle. In this sense, common or well-known '''propellants''' include, for [[firearm]]s, [[artillery]], and [[solid rocket|solid-propellant rocket]]s:
*Gun propellants, such as:
**[[Gunpowder]] (black powder)
**[[Nitrocellulose]]-based powders
**[[Cordite]]
**[[Ballistite]]
**[[Smokeless powder]]s
*[[Composite propellant]]s made from a solid [[oxidizer]] such as [[ammonium perchlorate]] or [[ammonium nitrate]], a [[synthetic rubber]] such as [[HTPB]], [[Polybutadiene acrylonitrile|PBAN]], or [[Polyurethane]] (or energetic polymers such as [[polyglycidyl nitrate]] or [[polyvinyl nitrate]] for extra energy), optional high-explosive fuels (again, for extra energy) such as [[RDX]] or [[nitroglycerin]], and usually a powdered [[metal]] [[fuel]] such as [[aluminum]].
*Some [[amateur rocketry|amateur]] propellants use [[potassium nitrate]], combined with [[sugar]], [[epoxy]], or other fuels and binder compounds.
*[[Potassium perchlorate]] has been used as an oxidizer, paired with [[asphalt]], [[epoxy]], and other binders.

Propellants that explode in operation are of little practical use currently, although there have been experiments with [[Pulse Detonation Engine]]s. Also the newly synthesized bishomocubane based compounds are under consideration in the research stage as both solid and liquid propellants of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lal|first1=Sohan|last2=Rajkumar|first2=Sundaram|last3=Tare|first3=Amit|last4=Reshmi|first4=Sasidharakurup|last5=Chowdhury|first5=Arindrajit|last6=Namboothiri|first6=Irishi N.

==== Grain ====
Solid propellants are used in forms called [[Solid-fuel rocket#Grain geometry|grains]]. A grain is any individual particle of propellant regardless of the size or shape. The shape and size of a propellant grain determines the burn time, amount of gas, and rate produced from the burning propellant and, as a consequence, thrust vs time profile.

There are three types of burns that can be achieved with different grains.
; Progressive burn: Usually a grain with multiple perforations or a star cut in the center providing a lot of surface area.
; Degressive burn: Usually a solid grain in the shape of a cylinder or sphere.
; Neutral burn: Usually a single perforation; as outside surface decreases the inside surface increases at the same rate.

==== Composition ====
There are four different types of solid propellant compositions:
; Single-based propellant: A single based propellant has nitrocellulose as its chief explosives ingredient. Stabilizers and other additives are used to control the chemical stability and enhance the propellant’s properties.
; Double-based propellant: Double-based propellants consist of nitrocellulose with nitroglycerin or other liquid organic nitrate explosives added. Stabilizers and other additives are also used. Nitroglycerin reduces smoke and increases the energy output. Double-based propellants are used in small arms, cannons, mortars and rockets.
; Triple-based propellant: Triple-based propellants consist of nitrocellulose, nitroguanidine, nitroglycerin or other liquid organic nitrate explosives. Triple-based propellants are used in cannons.
; Composite: Composites contain no nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin, nitroquanidine or any other organic nitrate. Composites usually consist of a fuel such as metallic aluminum, a combustible binder such as synthetic rubber or [[HTPB]], and an oxidizer such as ammonium perchlorate. Composite propellants are used in large rocket motors.

=== Liquid propellant ===
{{further|liquid fuel|liquid-propellant rocket}}
In rockets, three main liquid bipropellant combinations are used:  cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen, cryogenic oxygen and a hydrocarbon, and storable propellants.&lt;ref name=sutton2001&gt;
{{cite book |last=Sutton|first=George |author2=Biblarz, Oscar  |title=Rocket Propulsion Elements |year=2001 |publisher=Willey |isbn=9781601190604 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/rocket-propulsion-elements/oclc/75193234}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
; [[Cryogenic]] [[liquid oxygen|oxygen]]-[[liquid hydrogen|hydrogen]] combination system: Used in upper stages and sometimes in booster stages of space launch systems.This is a nontoxic combination. This gives high [[specific impulse]] and is ideal for high-velocity missions
; Cryogenic oxygen-hydrocarbon propellant system: Used for many booster stages of space [[launch vehicle]]s as well as a smaller number of [[second stage]]s. This combination of fuel/oxidizer has high density and hence allows for a more compact booster design.
; Storable propellant combinations: Used in almost all bipropellant low-thrust, auxiliary or [[reaction control system|reaction control]] rocket engines, as well as in some in large rocket engines for first and second stages of ballistic missiles. They are instant-starting and suitable for long-term storage.

Propellant combinations used for [[bipropellant rocket|liquid propellant rocket]]s include:
* [[Liquid oxygen]] and [[liquid hydrogen]]&lt;ref name=ars20130414a&gt;

A '''reactionless drive''' is a device producing [[motion (physics)|motion]] without the exhaust of a [[propellant]]. A [[Field propulsion|propellantless drive]] is not necessarily reactionless when it constitutes an [[open system (thermodynamics)|open system]] interacting with external [[Field (physics)|field]]s; but a reactionless drive is a particular case of a propellantless drive as it is a [[closed system]] presumably in contradiction with the [[Momentum#Conservation|law of conservation of momentum]] and often considered similar to a [[perpetual motion machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Winchell D. Chung Jr |title=Reactionless drives |url=http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/reactionlessdrive.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from [[Newton's third law]], which is usually expressed as, "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." A large number of infeasible devices, such as the [[Dean drive]], are a staple of [[science fiction]] particularly for [[space propulsion]].

== Closed systems ==
Through the years there have been numerous claims for functional reactionless drive designs using ordinary mechanics (i.e. devices not said to be based on quantum mechanics, relativity or atomic forces or effects). Two of these represent their general classes: The "Dean drive" is perhaps the best known example of a "linear oscillating mechanism" reactionless drive; The "GIT" is perhaps the best known example of a "rotating mechanism" reactionless drive. These two also stand out as they both received much publicity from their promoters and the popular press in their day and both were eventually rejected when proven to not produce any reactionless drive forces. The rise and fall of these devices now serves as a cautionary tale for those making and reviewing similar claims.&lt;ref name=NASA /&gt;

=== Dean drive ===
The [[Dean drive]] was a mechanical device concept promoted by inventor Norman L. Dean. Dean claimed that his device was a "reactionless thruster" and that his working models could demonstrate this effect. He held several private demonstrations but never revealed the exact design of the models nor allowed independent analysis of them.&lt;ref name=EngineWings&gt;{{cite journal |date=Sep 1961 |journal=Popular Mechanics |title=Engine With Built-in Wings}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Phasers&gt;{{cite journal |date=June 1976 |journal=Analog |title=Detesters, Phasers and Dean Drives}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dean's claims of reactionless thrust generation were subsequently shown to be in error and the "thrust" producing the directional motion was likely to be caused by [[friction]] between the device and the surface on which the device was resting and would not work in free space.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{cite conference |last=Mills |first=Marc G. |title=Responding to Mechanical Antigravity |conference=42nd Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit |author2=Thomas, Nicholas E.  |date=July 2006 |publisher=[[NASA]]  |url=http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2006/TM-2006-214390.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030093616/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2006/TM-2006-214390.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Physicists' View of Nature |first=Amit|last=Goswami |date=2000 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gwPHgcHK4sgC&amp;pg=PA60 |publisher=Springer |pages=60 |isbn=0-306-46450-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gyroscopic Inertial Thruster (GIT)===
The Gyroscopic Inertial Thruster is a proposed reactionless drive based on the mechanical principles of a rotating mechanism. The concept involves various methods of leverage applied against the supports of a large gyroscope. The supposed operating principle of a GIT is a mass traveling around a circular trajectory at a variable speed. The high-speed part of the trajectory allegedly generates greater centrifugal force than the low, so that there is a greater thrust in one direction than the other.&lt;ref name=LaViolette2008&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AiqZwmquWKkC&amp;pg=PA384 |page=384 |title=Secrets of Antigravity Propulsion: Tesla, UFOs, and Classified Aerospace Technology |last=LaViolette |first=Paul A. |publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co |date=2008 |isbn=1-59143-078-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish inventor Sandy Kidd, a former RAF radar technician, investigated the possibility (without success) in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=New Scientist |volume=148 |date=1995 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posited that a gyroscope set at various angles could provide a lifting force, defying gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PRa5P6dtkq0C&amp;pg=PA178 |page=178 |title=Anti-Gravity &amp; the Unified Field |last=Childress |first=David Hatcher |publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press |date=1990 |series=Lost Science |isbn=0-932813-10-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, several people sent suggestions to the Space Exploration Outreach Program (SEOP) at NASA recommending that NASA study a gyroscopic inertial drive, especially the developments attributed to the American inventor Robert Cook and the Canadian inventor Roy Thornson.&lt;ref name=LaViolette2008/&gt; In the 1990s and 2000s, enthusiasts attempted the building and testing of GIT machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/4549/mars.html|title=The Adventures of the Gyroscopic Inertial Flight Team|date=1998-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Laithwaite]], the "Father of Maglev", received a US patent for his "Propulsion System", which was claimed to create a linear thrust through gyroscopic and inertial forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|5860317}}&lt;/ref&gt; After years of theoretical analysis and laboratory testing of actual devices, no rotating (or any other) mechanical device has ever been found to produce unidirectional reactionless thrust in free space.&lt;ref name=NASA /&gt;

==Open systems==
{{Main article|Field propulsion}}

===Movement with thrust===

Several kinds of thrust generating methods are in use or have been proposed that are propellantless, as they do not work like rockets and reaction mass is not carried nor expelled from the device. However they are not reactionless, as they constitute open systems interacting with electromagnetic waves or various kinds of fields.

Most famous propellantless methods are the [[Gravity assist|gravity assist maneuver]] or gravitational slingshot of a spacecraft accelerating at the expense of the momentum of the planet it orbits, through the gravitational field, or [[beam-powered propulsion]] using the [[radiation pressure]] of electromagnetic waves from a distant source like a [[laser]].

More speculative methods have also been proposed, like the [[Woodward effect]], the [[quantum vacuum plasma thruster]] or various hypotheses trying to explain the thrust apparently produced by the [[RF resonant cavity thruster#Hypotheses|EmDrive]].

===Movement without thrust===
[[File:Alcubierre.png|thumbnail|2D visualisation of spacetime distortion induced by the Alcubierre metric.]]
{{main article|Alcubierre drive}}

Because there is no well-defined "center of mass" in [[Spacetime#Spacetime in general relativity|curved spacetime]], [[general relativity]] allows a stationary object to, in a sense, "change its position" in a counter-intuitive manner, without violating conservation of momentum.

* The [[Alcubierre drive]] is a hypothetical method of apparent [[faster-than-light]] propulsion for [[interstellar travel]] postulated from the theory of general relativity. Although this concept may be allowed by the currently accepted laws of physics, it remains unproven; implementation would require a [[negative energy]] density, and possibly a better understanding of [[quantum gravity]]. It is not clear how (or if) this effect could provide a useful means of accelerating an actual space vehicle and no practical designs have been proposed, but experiments are underway at [[Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory|NASA's Eagleworks Laboratories]] to attempt the first detection of an induced spacetime curvature, which could be the first step toward proving the validity of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kakaes |first=Konstantin |url= http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-03/warp-factor |title=Warp Factor: A NASA scientist claims to be on the verge of faster-than-light travel: is he for real?, Popular Science, April 2013 |publisher=PopSci.com |accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110015936.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* A hypothetical "impulse engine" or "distortion engine" creating a [[gravitational potential]] in spacetime, with no negative energy source contrary to the Alcubierre drive, would also produce a reactionless motion, being a low velocity (non [[Relativistic speed|relativistic]]) [[warp drive]].{{Citation needed|reason=Prior citation removed for lack of support|date=June 2018}}

* Some [[Bimetric gravity|bimetric theories of gravity]] with [[Variable speed of light#Modern VSL theories as an alternative to cosmic inflation|variable speed of light]] like the [[Jean-Pierre Petit#Janus cosmological model (Twin universe theory)|Janus cosmological model]] hypothesize apparent faster-than-light interstellar travel with no acceleration nor deceleration, using the energy difference of the two conjugated [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]]s to reach relativistic speeds after a mass inversion process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Petit|first1=J.P.|last2=d'Agostini|first2=G.|date=10 November 2014|title=Cosmological bimetric model with interacting positive and negative masses and two different speeds of light, in agreement with the observed acceleration of the Universe|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269464559_Cosmological_bimetric_model_with_interacting_positive_and_negative_masses_and_two_different_speeds_of_light_in_agreement_with_the_observed_acceleration_of_the_Universe|journal=Modern Physics Letters A|volume=29|issue=34|doi=10.1142/S021773231450182X|bibcode=2014MPLA...2950182P}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* “Swimming in spacetime” is a geometrical motive principle that exploits the curved spacetime metric of the gravitational field to permit an extended body undergoing specific deformations in shape, to change position. In weak gravitational fields, like that of Earth, the change in position per deformation cycle would be far too small to detect, but the concept remains of interest as the only unambiguous example of reactionless motion in mainstream physics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v301/n2/full/scientificamerican0809-38.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/hammock_physicist/swimming_through_empty_space|title=Swimming Through Empty Space|work=Science 2.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core mandate for SADAD is to facilitate and streamline bill payment transactions of end consumers through all channels of the Kingdom’s Banks. SADAD was launched on October 3, 2004.

SADAD links the commercial sector and local [[bank]]s, offering the ability to collect customer [[payment]]s electronically through all the banking channels in the kingdom 24 hours a day.

==History and background==

SAMA mandated that all banks must accept bill payments at their [[bank branch|branches]] from anyone. The payer does not have to be a customer of the bank. Pre-SADAD economics of bill payment placed an unduly large burden on banks; it was inefficient and slow. Banks recovered a small portion of the cost through keeping the collected money for varying periods of 7–30 days after the bill was paid.

Approximately 60-70% of bills were paid in cash at bank branches. Due to the high number of bills generated in the Kingdom, this results in high costs for banks in front office, payment processing, IT integration and reconciliation. In addition, consumers queue for a long time at banks’ front office desks before paying their bills. Bill presentment and collection is largely manual and paper-based creating significant inefficiencies and overheads for billers and banks.

Large billers formed bilateral agreements with banks in order to enhance bill payments collection. This enabled consumers to use their bank channels to view and pay bills (without any bill consolidation). It required every biller to connect to the twelve different banks operating in KSA and from banks to connect separately to every biller they are under contract with.

SAMA chose to integrate these connections through SADAD, which is a single platform that links different billers and banks to enable consumers to use the electronic channels of any bank. SADAD is now facilitating the payment of high-volume periodic bills (such as utility bills and phone bills) and customer initiated payments, such as traffic fines.

==How SADAD works==

# Billers send summary bills information to SADAD at a pre-determined schedule
# SADAD validates data received and uploads it into its database
# SADAD notifies billers of any discrepancies
# Customer requests bill information through bank channels
# The bank forwards the request received to SADAD
# SADAD retrieves bill information from its database and forwards it to customer
# Customer selects the bills to be paid and the respective amounts
# The bank debits the customer account and confirms the transaction
# SADAD updates its database based on the bank’s confirmation
# SADAD notifies relevant billers accordingly
# At the end of the day, billers receive reconciliation reports from SADAD showing a breakdown of all transactions processed by SADAD
# At the end of the day, SADAD initiates settlement instructions through [[Saudi Arabian Riyal Interbank Express|SARIE]]
# SADAD updates bills status to 'settled'

'''''Salix viminalis''''', the '''basket willow''',&lt;ref&gt;{{PLANTS|id=SAVI2|taxon=Salix viminalis|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''common osier''' or '''osier''', is a species of [[willow]] native to [[Europe]], [[Western Asia]], and the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref name=rdm&gt;Meikle, R. D. (1984). ''Willows and Poplars of Great Britain and Ireland''. BSBI Handbook No. 4. {{ISBN|0-901158-07-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rushforth&gt;Rushforth, K. (1999). ''Trees of Britain and Europe''. Collins {{ISBN|0-00-220013-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=perttu&gt;Perttu, K. L. and Kowalik, P. J. (1997). ''Salix vegetation filters for purification of waters and soils''. Biomass and Bioenergy, Volume 12, Issue 1, 1997, Pages 9-19. Elsevier Science Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Salix viminalis'' is a multistemmed [[shrub]] growing to between {{convert|3|and|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} (rarely to {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}) tall. It has long, erect, straight branches with greenish-grey [[Bark (botany)|bark]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] long and slender, 10–25&amp;nbsp;cm long but only 0.5–2&amp;nbsp;cm broad; they are dark green above, with a silky grey-haired underside. The [[flower]]s are [[catkin]]s, produced in early [[spring (season)|spring]] before the leaves; they are [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], with male and female catkins on separate plants. The male catkins are yellow and oval-shaped; the female catkins are longer and more cylindrical; they mature in early summer when the [[fruit]] [[capsule (fruit)|capsules]] split open to release the numerous minute [[seed]]s.&lt;ref name=rdm/&gt;&lt;ref name=rushforth/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
It is commonly found by streams and other wet places. The exact native range is uncertain due to extensive historical cultivation; it is certainly native from central Europe east to western Asia, but may also be native as far west as southeastern [[England]]. As a cultivated or [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] plant, it is widespread throughout both [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Ireland]], but only at lower [[altitude]]s. It is one of the least variable willows, but it will [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridise]] with several other species.&lt;ref name=rdm/&gt;&lt;ref name=rushforth/&gt;

==Uses==
Along with other related willows, the flexible twigs (called [[withy|withies]]) are commonly used in [[basket]]ry, giving rise to its alternative common name of "basket willow". In the Chilean village of Chimbarongo, it is used to fashion the renowned baskets.

Another increasing use is in [[energy forestry]],&lt;ref name=rdm/&gt; effluent treatment, in [[wastewater]] gardens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biospherefoundation.org/project/wastewater-gardens/?doing_wp_cron=1537306104.3177440166473388671875|title=Wastewater Gardens® - Biosphere Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[cadmium]] [[phytoremediation]] for [[water purification]].&lt;ref name=perttu/&gt;

''Salix viminalis'' is a known [[hyperaccumulator]] of  [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], petroleum [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[organic solvent]]s, [[Methyl tert-butyl ether|MTBE]], [[Trichloroethylene|TCE]] and byproducts, [[selenium]], [[silver]], [[uranium]], and [[zinc]],&lt;ref&gt;''Phytoremediation.''

The '''Schaffer–Vega diversity system''' (SVDS) was a wireless guitar system developed in 1975–76, engineered and prototyped by [[Ken Schaffer]] in New York City, and manufactured by the Vega Corporation, [[El Monte, California]]. A handheld microphone version was introduced in 1977.

The system was the first cordless system to be adopted by major rock acts because it solved technical problems common to earlier wireless systems. The reliable sound and freedom of movement it provided paved the way for bands to tour with large multi-level stages in arenas. Schaffer-Vegas were used in the late 1970s and early 1980s by many rock bands such as [[Pink Floyd]] (namely guitarist [[David Gilmour]]), [[the Rolling Stones]], [[AC/DC]] and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]].

==Background==
[[File:SVDS CARTOON.jpg|thumb|Early Advertisement]]
Traveling with [[the Rolling Stones]] on the [[The Rolling Stones' Tour of the Americas '75|Tour of The Americas '75]],&lt;ref name=MTV /&gt; New York-based engineer and radio aficionado [[Ken Schaffer]] witnessed the limitations of then-existing wireless systems and sought to develop a better system. The Schaffer-Vega Diversity System (SVDS) combined several new technologies to present a wireless system that was largely immune to the frequent signal fades, interfering signals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7EB4PJMPVsC&amp;pg=PT623 |title=Sound System Engineering |edition=4e |chapter=Microphones |first=Eugene, Jr. |last=Patronis |pages=623–4 |publisher=CRC Press |year=2013 |isbn=1136111417 |editors=Don Davis, Eugene Patronis, Pat Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; and limited dynamic range of previous wireless systems.&lt;ref name=Nady1979&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nady.com/news/gp_1979.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220170751/http://nady.com/news/gp_1979.pdf |archivedate=December 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }} ''Guitar Player Magazine'', March 1979, p. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; Schaffer gave precedence to developing the first system for wireless guitar (1976) and then the wireless microphone (1977).

After prototyping the wireless system, Schaffer arranged its manufacture by the Vega Corporation, based in El Monte, California. The first bands to use Schaffer-Vega Diversity System were [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and [[Electric Light Orchestra]].&lt;ref name=Nady1979/&gt; Though wireless systems afford great mobility on stage, Kiss switched to a wireless system for safety reasons: lead guitarist [[Ace Frehley]] had been knocked unconscious by a near-fatal shock traced to a ground fault between his wired guitar connection and a metal staging element.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starbacks.ca/SunsetStrip/Plaza/4837/guitarpl.htm  Kiss: Ace Frehley Interview] by Tom Wheeler and Steve Rosen, ''Guitar Player Magazine'', 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Going wireless with all guitars and microphones eliminated this hazard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/ace-frehley-i-d-love-to-do-an-instructional-video] Ace Frehley: "I'd Love To Do An Instructional Video&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kissfanshop.de/KissTours/1976USA.htm] The Kiss Shows: July 1, 1976 – April 4, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Gilmour]] of [[Pink Floyd]] was also an endorsee of Schaffer Vega wireless systems. He first used it on the 1980–81 concerts for ''[[The Wall]]'', especially when he performed "[[Comfortably Numb]]" from the top of the wall.

==Technical highlights==
The Schaffer–Vega diversity system used a [[space diversity]] method consisting of two independent VHF receivers fed by antennas placed at least one wavelength apart. Use of two full independent [[Receiver (radio)|receivers]], rather than two [[Directional antenna|parallel antennas]], made the Schaffer-Vega the first "True Diversity" system. The diversity technique prevented [[Degradation (telecommunications)|signal degradation]] due to multi-path cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musictoyz.com/articles/chopangus.php  Angus Young: Seriously, by Jan Obrecht, Guitar Player Magazine], February 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Schaffer-Vega system, a [[comparator]] monitored the instantaneous [[Radio frequency|RF]] signal strength delivered by each antenna to its dedicated receiver, that switched to the other receiver when the currently selected receiver's signal strength fell below a [[Masking threshold|quieting threshold]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musiclab.com.au/default/glossary-of-professional-audio-and-music-terms Diversity Receivers: Musiclab Glossary of Professional Audio and Music Terms] Musiclab, Australia.

The system achieved high [[Noise (audio)|interference]] rejection by using four [[helical resonator]] filters between the antenna and [[preamplifier]] stage of each receiver. This made it possible to use the systems on unused [[Very high frequency|VHF]] television broadcast frequencies and protected the receivers from even strong spurious local signals (such as nearby police calls, taxi dispatch, etc.). Limited by the US [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] to 50&amp;nbsp;mW output, the Schaffer-Vega Diversity System maintained reliable transmission for up to 100 meters in a line of sight from transmitter to receiver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US4061992 US Patent Office, Helical Resonator Filters, US Patent #/4061992, et. al.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the FCC and corresponding agencies in most [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] countries, regulations that limit the transmitter's [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[frequency deviation]] also limited the theoretical [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s and [[dynamic range]]s of wireless systems to approximately 70&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pro.sony.com/bbsccms/assets/files/cat/audio/brochures/UWP_Series_Final3-09.pdf Sony UTX-B2V/B2X Bodypack Transmitter Specs: Typical non-companded wireless signal-to-noise specification]&lt;/ref&gt; The Schaffer-Vega Diversity System also used [[companding]]. By compressing [[Amplitude|signal amplitude]] 2:1 in the transmitter and then expanding it in the receiver, it was possible for the system to deliver a signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range of 100&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shure.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3323/~/what-is-audio-reference-  What is Audio Reference Companding?], Shure Brothers, February 20, 2006. Retrieved February 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in the recording studio==
Although Schaffer's design objective was to create a wireless system that sounded transparent—as close as possible to the wired version—artists, such as [[Rick Derringer]], [[Eddie Van Halen]] and [[Angus Young]] of [[AC/DC]], chose to use their wireless units in the recording studio. The slight coloration added by the Schaffer-Vega was considered part of the desired guitar tone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solodallas.com/let-there-be-vegas-the-quest-formally-begins Angus Young’s Guitar Sound: The Quest Formally Begins] SoloDallas.com, Retrieved February 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the audio section of the SVDS was put into production and brought to market as a stand-alone effect by Filippo "SoloDallas" Olivieri and selected for inclusion in ''Guitar Player'' Magazine's 2015 Hall of Fame.

==Cessation of production==
Production ended in 1981, when Schaffer changed his focus to communications satellites.&lt;ref name=MTV&gt;Seth Scheisel, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/02/technology/circuits/i-want-my-moscow-tv.html?_r=0 "I Want my Moscow TV"], ''New York Times'', December 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Schaffer moved on, numerous competing systems had become staples in the market.

In 2013 the company changed out the management of the company and Mr. Bjørnar Iversen became CEO of the company and the company went true a significant restructuring where Mr. Frederik Wilhelm Mohn became the majority shareholder. The restructuring of Songa Offshore SE was elected by Marine Money Conference to be the offshore restructuring deal of the year 2013, world wide.

The company changed the strategy in 2013 to focus on the harsh environment North Atlantic mid-water market and sold the South East Asia rigs,  Songa Mercur and Songa Venus, to Opus Offshore in July 2014.

The company stands today out as a focused and leading player in the North Atlantic drilling market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Total System Services''' (commonly referred to as '''TSYS''') is a United States [[credit card]] processor, merchant acquirer and [[bank credit card]] issuer. TSYS provides payment processing, merchant, and related payment services to financial and nonfinancial institutions in the United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico, and internationally. It operates through four segments: North America Services, International Services, Merchant Services, and NetSpend.  TSYS has headquarters in [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], United States.

==History==
In 1959 TSYS started as a division of Columbus Bank and Trust (CB&amp;T).  In 1974, CB&amp;T started processing credit cards for other banks.  In 1983, TSYS became a separate publicly traded company, although majority ownership remained with CB&amp;T and its successor, [[Synovus]].  In 1991, TSYS began development on the next generation of processing platforms.  Then in 1994, TSYS launched TS2. On September 24, 1999 TSYS opened up its new Riverfront Campus in Downtown Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tsys.com/About/history.cfm TSYS History]." Retrieved on January 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 25, 2007, TSYS and [[Synovus]] (holding 81% of shares at the time) announced a spin-off that was completed as of the end of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tsys.com/news/Releases/20071025agreementspinoff.cfm TSYS Board Approves Agreement with Synovus for Spin-Off]." Retrieved on March 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 12, 1999, Total System Services, Inc. announced the signing of a multi-year agreement with Bancahsa, to process its Honducard-Visa credit cards, which represented a step in Total System Services' international expansion strategy to become the global processor of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Total+System+Services,+Inc.(R)+Moves+into+Central+America%3B+Signs...-a055122747| title=Total System Services, Inc.(R) Moves into Central America; Signs Leading Honduran Bank for Visa Card Processing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, following  merger between Bank One and Chase to form J.P. Morgan Chase, TSYS was awarded a contract to process its credit services business of 87 million cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-123233177/columbus-ga-based-credit.html|title=Columbus, Ga.-based credit account processor completes J.P.

In February 2017, TSYS's lobbying of the [[GOP]] was credited for a bill that would remove the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]]'s limits on overdraft fees. 10-12% of NetSpend's revenue comes from these fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=93E7701E-B4E3-4A91-9CBB-82CF622FDF07&amp;filingTypeID=78|title=LD-2 Lobbying Report|work=[[United States Senate]]|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/republicans-are-moving-to-scrap-rules-on-overdraft-charges|title=Republicans Are Moving To Scrap Rules That Limit Overdraft Fees|last=Zeitlin|first=Matthew|date=2017-02-08|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TSYS acquired a former [[Citigroup]] card production facility in [[Columbus, Ohio]] and invested $25 million to build out a second, {{convert|200,000|sqft}} credit card production facility which it began operating in late 2017. The facility is intended to have the capacity to produce 67 million credit cards a year when it is at full capacity and employ 145 people. The company said the investment would help it grow production and insulate its business from interruptions due to all work being located in one site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2018/02/02/creditcard-maker-adding-jobs-as-it-ramps-up.html |title=Credit-card maker adding jobs as it ramps up production at Columbus plant |last=Navera |first=Tristan |publisher=''[[Columbus Business First]]'' |location=Columbus, Ohio |date=2018-02-08 |accessdate=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=December 2011}}
'''Timed text''' refers to the presentation of text media in synchrony with other media, such as audio and video.

==Applications==
Typical applications of timed text are the real-time [[subtitles|subtitling]] of foreign-language movies on the [[World Wide Web|Web]], [[captioning]] for people lacking audio devices or having [[hearing impairment]]s, [[karaoke]], scrolling news items or [[teleprompter]] applications.

Timed text for [[MPEG-4]] movies and cellphone media is specified in [[MPEG-4 Part 17|MPEG-4 Part 17 Timed Text]], and its [[MIME]] type is specified by RFC 3839.

==Markup language specifications==
The [[W3C]] keeps two standards intended to regulate timed text on the [[Internet]]: the [[Timed Text Markup Language|Timed Text Markup Language (TTML)]]&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Adams (Ed.): [http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/ Timed Text Markup Language (TTML) 1.0 - W3C Recommendation, 18 November 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[WebVTT]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.w3.org/html5/webvtt/ WebVTT Draft Report]&lt;/ref&gt; (currently in draft stage).
[[SMPTE]] created additional metadata structures for use in TTML and developed a profile of TTML called [[SMPTE-TT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://store.smpte.org/product-p/st%202052-1-2010.htm
 |format=PDF |title=ST-2052-1; SMPTE Timed Text, Copyright © 2010 SMPTE. August 2010 |author=SMPTE |date=August 2010 |accessdate=2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DECE]] incorporated the SMPTE Timed Text in their [[UltraViolet (System)|UltraViolet]] [[Common File Format]] specification.

==Competing formats==
Interoperability for timed text came up during the development of the [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]] 2.0 specification. Today, incompatible formats for captioning, subtitling and other forms of timed text are used on the Web. This means that when creating a SMIL presentation, the text portion often needs to be targeted to a particular playback environment. Moreover, the accessibility community relies heavily on captioning to make audiovisual content accessible. The lack of an interoperable format adds a significant additional cost to the costs of captioning Web content, which are already high.

==Example==
The following is an extract from the [[commons:TimedText:Krazy Kat Bugolist 1916 silent.ogv.en.srt|English closed captioning file]], in [[SubRip]] format, for the 1916 [[:File:Krazy Kat Bugolist 1916 silent.ogv|Krazy Kat Bugolist film]].

The equivalent in W3C [[WebVTT]] is the following:

 WEBVTT
 
 00:22.000 --&gt; 00:27.000

 Something tells me
 
 00:58.000 --&gt; 01:59.000 
 Look, Ignatz, a sleeping bee

The equivalent in W3C TTML is the following:

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;tt xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/ttml"&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div begin="22s" dur="5s"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I'll teach thee Bugology, Ignatzes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div begin="40s" dur="3s"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Something tells me&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div begin="58s" dur="61s"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Look, Ignatz, a sleeping bee&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In domains of [[physics]] and [[electrical engineering]], the '''Universal Dielectric Response''', or '''UDR''', refers to the observed emergent behaviour  of the [[dielectric]] properties exhibited by diverse solid state systems. In particular this widely observed response involves power law scaling of dielectric properties with [[frequency]] under conditions of [[alternating current]], AC. First defined in a landmark article by [[A. K. Jonscher]] in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonscher| first1= Andrew K.| title= The 'universal'dielectric response| journal= Nature| year=1977| volume=267| issue=5613| page=673| bibcode=1977Natur.267..673J| doi=10.1038/267673a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the origins of the UDR were attributed to the dominance many-body interactions in systems, and their analogous RC network equivalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Jonscher| first1= Andrew K.| title= The universal dielectric response and its physical significance| journal= ." IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation| year=1992| volume=27| issue=3| page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universal Dielectric Response manifests in the variation of AC Conductivity with frequency and is most often observed in complex systems consisting of multiple phases of similar or dissimilar materials. Such systems, which can be called heterogenous or composite materials, can be described from a dielectric perspective as a large network consisting of resistor and capacitor elements, known also as an [[RC circuit|RC network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=McCullen | first1= Nicholas J. | title= The robustness of the emergent scaling property of random RC network models of complex materials | journal= . Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics  | year=2009 | volume=42 | issue=6
| page=064001| bibcode= 2009JPhD...42f4001M | doi= 10.1088/0022-3727/42/6/064001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At low and high frequencies, the dielectric response of heterogeneous materials is governed by percolation pathways. If a heterogeneous material is represented by a network in which more than 50% of the elements are capacitors, [[percolation]] through capacitor elements will occur. This percolation results in conductivity at high and low frequencies that is directly proportional to frequency. Conversely, if the fraction of capacitor elements in the representative RC network (P&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) is lower than 0.5, dielectric behavior at low and high frequency regimes is independent of frequency. At intermediate frequencies, a very broad range of heterogeneous materials show a well-defined emergent region, in which power law correlation of [[admittance]] to frequency is observed. The power law emergent region is they key feature of the UDR. In materials or systems exhibiting UDR, the overall dielectric response from high to low frequencies is symmetrical, being centered at the middle point of the emergent region, which occurs in equivalent RC networks at a frequency of :&lt;math&gt;\omega = (RC)^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;. In the power law emergent region, the  admittance of the overall system follows the general power law proportionality &lt;math&gt; Y\propto\omega^{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;, where the power law exponent α can be approximated to the fraction of capacitors in the equivalent RC network of the system α≅P&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Universality of the emergent scaling in finite random binary percolation networks| journal= PLOS One | year=2017 | volume=12 |issue=2 | pages= e0172298| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0172298| pmid= 28207872 | pmc= 5312937 | last1= Zhai | first1= C | last2= et al | bibcode= 2017PLoSO..1272298Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance of the UDR ==
The power law scaling of dielectric properties with frequency is valuable in interpreting [[impedance spectroscopy]] data towards the characterisation of responses in emerging [[ferroelectric]] and [[multiferroic]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=MacDonald | first1= J.R.| title= Generalizations of ''universal dielectric response''and a general distribution‐of‐activation‐energies model for dielectric and conducting systems| journal= Journal of Applied Physics| year=1985| volume=58| issue=5| page=1971| bibcode=1985JAP....58.1971M| doi=10.1063/1.336004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Pattanayak | first1= Samita| title= Generalizations of ''Effect of Dy-substitution on structural, electrical and magnetic properties of multiferroic BiFeO3 ceramics| journal= Ceramics International | year=2014| volume=40| issue=6| page=7983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples for environmental values are forest cover connectivity, [[soil]] stabilization, [[microclimate]] under retained [[tree]]s, [[habitat]]s associated with live or dead trees and species diversity due to habitat preservation, and [[wildlife corridor]] preservation. Variable retention also aids in emulation of natural disturbances by leaving behind some residual structure from previous stand which is typical for stand replacing disturbances &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Franklin | first1 = J.F. | last2 = Spies | first2 = T.A. | last3 = Van Pelt | first3 = R. | last4 = Carey | first4 = A.B. | last5 = Thornburgh | first5 = D.A. | last6 = Berg | first6 = D.R. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2002 | title = Disturbances and structural development of natural forest ecosystems with silvicultural implications, using douglas-fir forests as an example | url = https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=25965&amp;content=PDF| journal = Forest Ecology and Management | volume = 155 | issue = 1-3| pages = 399–423 | doi=10.1016/s0378-1127(01)00575-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional silviculture systems such as [[clearcutting|clearcut]], patch cut, [[shelterwood]], etc. are focused on maximizing timber production and future regeneration of the trees.

== Value of variable retention ==
Variable retention is gradually becoming a popularly promoted tool for helping resolve the dilemma between demands for [[wood]] and demands to maintain [[habitat]] and [[ecology]] [[biodiversity]] and structural diversity in managed forests. What is at issue is how much a forest operation can log without adversely interfering with other ecological processes within the forest.

Variable retention minimizes the impact of logging operation by leaving biological legacies such as coarse woody debris(nurse logs and snags). Either few trees or many trees can be retained under the variable retention system, and trees can be retained in patches (aggregated retention) or left uniformly throughout a stand (dispersed retention); hence the name "variable retention."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Nicholas J.|last2=Beese|first2=William J.|date=2012|title=Effects of Low Levels of Dispersed Retention on the Growth and Survival of Young, Planted Douglas-Fir|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/3/2/230|journal=Forests|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=230–243|doi=10.3390/f3020230|id=http://hdl.handle.net/10613/2717}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a technique for retaining trees as key structural elements of a harvested stand for at least until next harvest rotation in an effort to maintain species, habitat diversity and forest-related processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beese|first=W J|last2=Dunsworth|first2=B G|last3=Zielke|first3=K.|last4=Bancroft|first4=B.|date=2003|title=Maintaining attributes of old-growth forests in coastal B.C. through variable retention|url=http://pubs.cif-ifc.org/doi/abs/10.5558/tfc79570-3|journal=The Forestry Chronicle|volume=79|issue=3|pages=570–578|doi=10.5558/tfc79570-3|issn=0015-7546|id=http://hdl.handle.net/10613/2701}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 meta-analysis of retention forestry research found "support for wider use of retention forestry since it moderates negative harvesting impacts on biodiversity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fedrowitz|first=Katja|last2=Koricheva|first2=Julia|last3=Baker|first3=Susan C.|last4=Lindenmayer|first4=David B.|last5=Palik|first5=Brian|last6=Rosenvald|first6=Raul|last7=Beese|first7=William|last8=Franklin|first8=Jerry F.|last9=Kouki|first9=Jari|date=2014|others=|title=REVIEW: Can retention forestry help conserve biodiversity?

There are four key mechanisms through which variable retention is presumed to maintain [[biodiversity]]:
* By providing a constant supply of structural features that are at high risk to being lost due to modern forestry practices and that are known to be important to [[habitat]] availability, such as large trees, very young trees, [[snag (ecology)|snag]]s, and [[coarse woody debris]]
* By providing adequate refuge for sensitive species that will colonize the surrounding managed forest environment as it develops suitable conditions
* By establishing habitat patches, [[Patch dynamics]], that can serve as stepping stones for the dispersal of newly produced offspring, seeds, and spores
* By increasing the structural diversity of managed stands

== Variable retention - Harvesting methods ==
The method of variable retention is a more deliberate process than [[clearcutting]]. In some cases [[Heli-logging|helicopters]] take the logs out. The use of the helicopters avoid the need to build logging roads inside the forest and hence avoid the disturbance of the forest floor. Yet, helicopter logging is less fuel efficient than truck use. Some logging operations that use variable retention try to emulate [[Disturbance (ecology)|forest disturbances]]. In those cases, deadwood in snags and logs is left behind. Such dead or dying trees provide a growth medium for [[fungi]] and [[epiphytes]], as well as food and shelter for [[insect]]s and the [[bird]]s. Loggers also leave younger trees that will continue to grow.

Variable retention harvesting retains more than 15% of the original stand in both rolling and permanent pockets of untouched trees and [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] patches. Retained forest structure is composed of live and dead trees that enhance structural diversity, and provide a hospitable [[habitat]] for variety of living organisms that prevail in the unlogged forest. This silviculture regime provides post-harvest ecological structure while creating sufficient opportunity to plant and naturally regenerate valuable tree species for [[timber]], as well as restore historical [[conifer]]ous and/or [[deciduous]] tree dominance to the forestland. Some timber companies have restricted the use of variable retention silviculture to only poorly stocked stands of rare but valuable tree species.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

== Controversy ==
[[Ecology|Ecologist]]s regard the variable retention method of harvesting as being far less detrimental to the forest [[ecosystem]] than [[clearcutting]]. However, opponents claim that variable retention is much more laborious, tedious, time-consuming and expensive than clearcutting.

Forestry organizations, such as the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), approve of variable retention and are now declaring [[timber]] obtained through such a harvesting method as [[certified wood]] for [[green building]]. Many forest operations in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[British Columbia]], including [[MacMillan Bloedel]], use the variable retention method to harvest timber in the [[Pacific temperate rain forests (WWF ecoregion)|temperate rain forests along the Pacific coast]].

Many logging companies have not maintained a total commitment to phasing out clearcutting and embracing variable retention harvesting, and even MacMillan Bloedel had occasionally fallen short of its commitment to phase out clearcutting. Although world markets are beginning to ask for [[certified wood]] obtained entirely through variable retention harvesting, it is not yet clear whether the general population of consumers will be willing to pay higher prices for such wood. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Space travel and rocketry gained popularity in Germany following the June 1923 publication of [[Herman Oberth]]'s book ''Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen'' ({{lang-en|The Rocket into Planetary Space}}) and the expanded 1929 work ''Wege zur Raumschiffahrt'' (''Ways to Spaceflight'').

The VfR was founded in 1927 by [[Johannes Winkler]], with [[Max Valier]] and [[Willy Ley]] following participation as expert advisers for [[Fritz Lang]]'s early [[science fiction]] film ''[[Frau im Mond]]'' (''The Woman in the Moon''). Ley and Hermann Oberth had hoped to receive funding from Lang for a real life experimental rocket launch coinciding with the movie's premiere.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SnAMx8A7k68C The Nazi Rocketeers, Dreams of Space and Crimes of War] ({{ISBN|0811733874}} pp 4 and 27. See extensive bibliography there.&lt;/ref&gt; Valier had assisted in [[Fritz von Opel]]'s rocket-powered [[publicity stunt]]s for the [[Opel]] company.

In September 1930, before Hitler came to power, the VfR contacted the German army for funding. Rockets were one of the few fields of military development not restricted by the Versailles treaty at the end of [[World War I]], 11 years earlier. They received permission from the municipality to use an abandoned ammunition dump at [[Reinickendorf]],[http://greyfalcon.us/restored/History%20of%20German%20Rocketry.htm] the [[Berlin rocket launching site]] ({{lang-de|Raketenflugplatz Berlin}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/german/highlights.html|title=Highlights in German Rocket Development|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For three years the VfR fired increasingly powerful rockets of their own design from this location. Following the unsuccessful [[Mirak (rocket)|Mirak rocket]]s, the most powerful rocket of the Repulsor series (named for a spaceship in a German novel by [[Kurd Lasswitz]])&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{Cite book |last=Collins |first=Martin |year=2007 |title=After Sputnik: 50 Years of the Space Age |series= |location=New York |publisher=Smithsonian Books |isbn=978-0-06-089781-9 |page=16 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; reached altitudes over 1&amp;nbsp;km (3,000&amp;nbsp;ft).

In the Spring of 1932; Capt [[Walter Dornberger]], his commander (Captain Ritter von Horstig), and Col [[Karl Heinrich Emil Becker]] viewed a (failed) VfR firing, and Dornberger subsequently issued a contract for a demonstration launch.

The only known VfR rocket artifact is a rejected aluminium Repulsor nozzle which member Herbert Schaefer took to the US when he emigrated in 1935 and which he donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1978.&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt;

'''Visual MIMO''' is an optical communication system. The name is derived from [[MIMO]], where the multiple transmitter multiple receiver model has been adopted for [[light]] in the [[visible spectrum|visible]] and non-visible spectrum. In Visual MIMO, a [[light-emitting diode|LED]] or [[electronic visual display]] serves as the transmitter, while a [[digital camera|camera]] serves as the receiver.

The '''W76''' is a United States [[thermonuclear bomb|thermonuclear warhead]]. It was manufactured from 1978-1987, and is still in service {{As of|2017|lc=on}}.

The W-76 is carried inside a Mk-4 [[MIRV|re-entry vehicle]]. U.S. [[Trident I]] and [[Trident II]] SLBM/[[Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile]]s may carry W76 warheads as one warhead option, along with [[W88]] warheads in the Trident II.

The dimensions of the W76 and Mk-4 [[reentry vehicle]] which carries it are not known; only the warhead's weight of 362 pounds (164&amp;nbsp;kg) has been disclosed.

The W76 has a [[Nuclear weapon yield|yield]] of 100 [[ton|kilotons]].

The upgraded W76-1/Mk4A will be used in both American and British submarines.&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen, Hans. [https://fas.org/blog/ssp/2011/04/britishw76-1.php "British Submarines to Receive Upgraded US Nuclear Warhead."] ''FAS'', 1 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensions to the service lives for 800 of the warheads was approved by the US government in 2000, then later increased to 2,000.  The project is scheduled for completion in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Pincus, Walter, "Strategic Plan Extends Life Span Of Nuclear Arsenal", ''[[Washington Post]]'', 19 May 2011, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The warhead is currently the most numerous weapon in the US nuclear arsenal,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/W76.html&lt;/ref&gt; having replaced the [[UGM-73 Poseidon|Poseidon SLBM]] warhead, the [[W68]], in that capacity.

'''WebAssign''' is an American [[educational]] company which provides online homework application for faculty and students.

==Online instruction==
WebAssign is one service among several online [[homework]] system providers. This particular service was developed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Guernsey |title=Textbooks and Tests That Talk Back |url=http://chronicle.com/free/v45/i23/23a02101.htm |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |publisher= |date=1999-02-12 |accessdate=2007-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; launched, and is hosted at [[North Carolina State University]].

WebAssign's core function is to load end-of-chapter questions from various textbooks into its archives, from which instructors may pick and choose in order to assemble a virtual assignment. Students must pay for access to their homework at a rate that varies based on the text they are accessing and are presented with multiple lengths of time for which they can activate their subscription, but are asked to pay more for longer subscriptions. The associated cost ranges widely, usually requiring students to pay between $15 and $70 per semester or quarter.

==History==
WebAssign was developed in 1997 by a small group of academics in the Department of Physics at North Carolina State University. The product was piloted in several large classes at NCSU.

WebAssign became commercially available as a hosted subscription service in January 1998 under the leadership of John Risley, a physics education specialist and professor in the Department of Physics at North Carolina State University. WebAssign became one of NC State's fastest growing spin-offs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Price|first=Jay|title=NCSU spinoff develops online homework service|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/01/10/1766128/ncsu-spinoff-making-good.html|publisher=newsobserver.com|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feedback from instructors and students in physics, math, statistics, and chemistry is used in expanding and refining the product.

In 1998, WebAssign incorporated under the name Advanced Instructional Systems with Risley as CEO. In 2003, the company officially spun off from NCSU and moved to NCSU's Centennial Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=James|title=WebAssign takes homework to the Web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2009/02/23/smallb1.html?page=all|publisher=Triangle Business Journal|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, WebAssign reincorporated as an employee-owned benefit corporation, a hybrid between a traditional stock corporation (being for profit) and a non-profit that has a social mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McQuaid|first=Annie|title=WebAssign Becomes a 'Benefit Corporation'|url=http://webassignwired.webassign.net/2013/02/06/webassign-becomes-a-benefit-corporation/|publisher=WebAssign Wired|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; WebAssign's stated benefit is education, with all company strategy and decisions dedicated to promoting, supporting, and improving education and learning.

WebAssign was named a finalist in the "Software Company" category by the North Carolina Technology Association (NCTA); the NCTA 21 Awards is North Carolina's statewide technology awards program, recognizing companies that have characterized excellence, innovation, and leadership in 21 categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McQuaid|first=Annie|title=NCTA 21 Awards Finalist|url=http://webassignwired.webassign.net/2012/10/09/ncta-21-awards-finalist/|publisher=WebAssignedWired|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016 Webassign was acquired by [[Cengage Learning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/09/27/cengage-learning-acquires-webassign.aspx | title=Cengage Learning Acquires WebAssign}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a deal led by Judah Karkowsky.
