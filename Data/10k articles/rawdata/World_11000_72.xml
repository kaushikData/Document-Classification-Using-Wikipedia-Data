After the Romans conquered [[Moesia]] in the 75 BC, the new castrum (imperial domain with estates) and municipium was known initially as ''Ulpianorum'' and then ''Remesiana'' ([[Moesi]]) and laid on the [[Via Militaris]] road, between [[Naissus]] and [[Serdica]].

Emperor [[Justinian]] (r. 527–565) had following strongholds in the district of Remesiana:

[[File:ASTRA in Simleu Silvaniei, August 1908.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''ASTRA'' group picture at [[Notre Dame Church, Șimleu Silvaniei]], August 1908 (published same year in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'')]]
'''Asociaţia Transilvană pentru Literatura Română şi Cultura Poporului Român''' (abbreviated '''ASTRA'''; in English, '''The Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and the Culture of the Romanian People''') is a cultural association founded in 1861 in [[Sibiu]]. It had an important role in the cultural life and the movement of [[National awakening of Romania|national awakening]] for the [[Romanians]] in [[Transylvania]].

Its first president was the [[Romania]]n [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of [[Sibiu]] &amp;mdash; [[Andrei Şaguna]]. Its vicepresident was the [[Greek-Catholic]] [[priest]] [[Timotei Cipariu]], and [[George Bariţiu]] was secretary.

Shortly after its founding, the association established a boarding school, museum, and large library in its provenance of Sibiu, and later developed a network of ASTRA libraries in Transylvanian towns. On 7 February 1895, ASTRA decided to edit and publish a ''Romanian Encyclopedia'' under the supervision of [[Cornel Diaconovici]]. It was published in three volumes between 1898 and 1904, and had an important role in the culture and politics of the Romanians.

Today, the central ASTRA library contains approximately half a million works, mostly acquired through donations of the Transylvanian population, local publishing houses, or publication exchanges organized with other libraries.

Liburnicon is a festival for fans of science fiction, fantasy, advanced science, history and mythology, organised by the association "Kulturni front". Liburnicon is held in [[Opatija]], a seaside town situated under the Učka mountain on the shore of northern Adriatic.

The first Liburnicon was held in 2006, under the name Abbacon. It was a gathering of several dozen science fiction and fantasy fans from Opatija and the surrounding region. Initially, Liburnicon was conceived as a small summer convention in the Liburnia region, and over time it developed into a festival that also offers musical, artistic, and excursion content.

'''Drohiczyn Land''' (Polish: ziemia drohiczynska, also ziemia drohicka), named after the town of [[Drohiczyn]], was an administrative unit ([[ziemia]]) of both the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. It was part of [[Podlaskie Voivodeship (1513–1795)|Podlasie Voivodeship]].

The history of Drohiczyn Land as a separate entity dates back to 1413, when it was part of [[Trakai Voivodeship]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In 1513, it made up the newly created Podlasie Voivodeship, together with two other [[ziemia|lands]]: [[Bielsk Land]] and [[Mielnik Land]]. Local [[sejmik]]s took place at Drohiczyn, where two envoys to the [[Warsaw]] [[Sejm]] were elected.

Drohiczyn Land ceased to exist after the [[Partitions of Poland]].

An '''enemy''' or a '''foe''' is an individual or a group that is [[Authentication|verified]] as forcefully adverse or threatening. The concept of an enemy has been observed to be "basic for both individuals and communities".&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer Ostow, ''Spirit, Mind, &amp; Brain: A Psychoanalytic Examination of Spirituality and Religion'' (2007), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "enemy" serves the social function of designating a particular entity as a threat, thereby invoking an intense emotional response to that entity.&lt;ref name="IPP"&gt;Martha L. Cottam, Beth Dietz-Uhler, Elena Mastors, ''Introduction to Political Psychology'' (2009), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The state of being or having an enemy is '''enmity''', '''foehood''' or '''foeship'''.

== Terms ==
[[File:Yevgeny Onegin by Repin.jpg|thumbnail|[[Duel]] between two enemies]]
Enemy comes from the 9th century Latin word ''inimi'', derived from [[Latin language|Latin]] for "bad friend" ({{lang-la|inimicus}}).&lt;ref name="Greene2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Greene|title=The 33 Strategies Of War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LqbbUBHK8b4C&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=29 August 2013|date=3 September 2010|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=978-1-84765-142-6|page=9|quote=...the word “enemy”—from the Latin inimicus, “not a friend”...}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Enemy" is a strong word, and "emotions associated with the enemy would include [[anger]], [[hatred]], [[frustration]], [[envy]], [[jealousy]], [[fear]], [[distrust]], and possibly grudging [[respect]]".&lt;ref name="IPP"/&gt; As a political concept, an enemy is likely to be met with [[hate]], [[violence]], [[battle]] and [[war]]. The opposite of an enemy is a [[friendship|friend]] or [[Allies|ally]]. Because the term "the enemy" is a bit bellicose and [[militaristic]] to use in polite society, informal substitutes are more often used. Often the substituted terms become [[pejorative]]s in the context that they are used. In any case, the designation of an "enemy" exists solely to denote the status of a particular group of people as a threat, and to propagate this designation within the local context. Substituted terms for an enemy often go further to meaningfully identify a known group as an enemy, and to pejoratively frame that identification. A government may seek to represent a person or group as a threat to the public good by designating that person or group to be a [[public enemy]].

The characterization of an individual or/and group as an enemy is called [[demonization]]. The propagation of demonization is a major aspect of [[propaganda]]. An "enemy" may also be conceptual; used to describe impersonal phenomena such [[disease]], and a host of other things. In [[theology]], "the Enemy" is typically reserved to represent an evil [[deity]],&lt;ref name="Tylor"&gt;[[Edward Burnett Tylor]], ''Primitive culture'' (1873), p. 323-4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[devil]] or a [[demon]]. For example, "in early [[Iroquois]] legend, the Sun and Moon, as god and goddess of Day and Night, had already acquired the characters of the great friend and enemy of man, the Good and Evil Deity".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt; Conversely, some religions describe a monotheistic [[God]] as an enemy; for example, in [[1 Samuel]] 28:16, the spirit of Samuel tells a disobedient Saul: "Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?"

"The enemy," as the object of social anger or repulsion, has throughout history been used as the prototypical [[propaganda]] tool to focus the fear and anxiety within a society toward a particular target. The target is often ''general,'' as with an [[ethnic group]] or [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] of people, or it can also be a conceptual target, as with an ideology which characterises a particular group. In some cases the concept of the enemy have morphed; whereas once ''racial and ethnic'' claims to support a call to [[war]] may later have changed to ideological and conceptual based claims.

During the [[Cold War]], the terms "Communists" or "Reds" were believed by many in American society to mean "the enemy," and the meaning of the two terms could be extremely pejorative, depending on the political context, mood, or state of fear and agitation within the society at the time.

Generally, the counterpoint to an enemy is a [[friend]] or [[Pact|ally]], although the term [[frenemy]] has been coined to capture the sense of a relationship wherein the parties are allied for some purposes and at odds with one another for other purposes.

== As a function of social science ==
[[File:British Commonwealth and allies.jpg|thumbnail|Unity of various countries against a common enemy]]
The existence or perceived existence of a collective enemy tends to increase the cohesiveness of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Ferrante-Wallace, ''Sociology: A Global Perspective'' (2006), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the identification and treatment of other entities as enemies may be irrational, and a sign of a psychological dysfunction. For example, [[group polarization]] may devolve into [[groupthink]], which may lead members of the "in" group to perceive nonmembers or other groups as enemies even where the others present neither antagonism nor an actual threat.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Weiten, ''Psychology: Themes and Variations'',  p. 546.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paranoid schizophrenia]] is characterized by the irrational belief that other people, ranging from family members and personal acquaintances to celebrities seen on television, are personal enemies plotting harm to the sufferer.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Weiten, ''Psychology: Themes and Variations'',  p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer Ostow, ''Spirit, Mind, &amp; Brain: A Psychoanalytic Examination of Spirituality and Religion'' (2007), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Irrational approaches may extend to treating impersonal phenomena not merely as conceptual enemies, but as sentient actors intentionally bringing strife to the sufferer.

The concept of the enemy is well covered in the field of [[peace and conflict studies]], which is available as a major at many major universities. In peace studies, enemies are those entities who are perceived as frustrating or preventing achievement of a goal. The enemy may not even know they are being regarded as such, since the concept is one-sided.  

Thus, in order to achieve peace, one must eliminate the threat.  This can be achieved by:
* destroying the enemy
* changing one's perception of an entity as enemy
* achieving the goal the enemy is frustrating.

Personal conflicts are frequently either unexamined (one's goals are not well defined) or examined only from one point of view.  This means it is often possible to resolve conflict (to eliminate the cause of the conflict) by redefining goals such that the frustration (not the person) is eliminated, obvious, negotiated away, or decided upon.

== In literature ==
{{Expand section|date=July 2018}}
In [[literature]], stories are often developed by presenting a primary character, the [[protagonist]], as overcoming obstacles presented by an [[antagonist]] who is depicted as a personal enemy of the protagonist. Serial fictional narratives of heroes often present the hero contending against an [[archenemy]] whose capabilities match or exceed those of the hero, thereby establishing tension as to whether the hero will be able to defeat this enemy. The enemy may be displayed as an evil character who plans to harm innocents, so that the reader will side with the protagonist in the need to battle the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Colm Hogan, ''What Literature Teaches Us about Emotion'' (2011), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
[[File:Abdul Samad, left, a recently reintegrated Taliban commander, and Afghan policeman Nic Mohammed, the commander of the Afghan Local Police in Khas Uruzgan, inventory supplies in Khas Uruzgan district, Uruzgan 120304-N-JC271-051.jpg|thumbnail|Former enemy rebel (on the left) forgiven by a police commander (on the right)]]
Various legal and theological regimes exist governing the treatment of enemies. Many religions have precepts favoring forgiveness and reconciliation with enemies. The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] states that "[h]atred of an enemy is a natural impulse of primitive peoples",&lt;ref name="JE"&gt;Kaufmann Kohler, David Philipson, Treatment of an Enemy, The Jewish Encyclopedia (1906).&lt;/ref&gt; while "willingness to forgive an enemy is a mark of advanced moral development".&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt; It contends that the teaching of the Bible, Talmud, and other writings, "gradually educates the people toward the latter stage",&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt; stating that "indications in the Bible of a spirit of hatred and vengeance toward the enemy... are for the most part purely nationalistic expressions—hatred of the national enemy being quite compatible with an otherwise kindly spirit".&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt;

===Religious doctrines===

Virtually all major religions have "similar ideals of love, the same goal of benefiting humanity through spiritual practice, and the same effect of making their followers into better human beings".&lt;ref&gt;The [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], quoted in John Templeton, ''Agape Love: Tradition In Eight World Religions'' (2008), p. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore widely expressed in world religions that enemies should be treated with love, kindness, compassion, and forgiveness.

The [[Book of Exodus]] states: "If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and thou wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him."&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 23:4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Proverbs]] similarly states: "Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth and let not thy heart be glad when he stumbleth",&lt;ref&gt;Proverbs 24:17.&lt;/ref&gt; and: "If thine enemy be hungry give him bread to eat, and if he be thirsty give him water to drink. For thus shalt thou heap coals of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward thee".&lt;ref&gt;Proverbs 25:21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish Encyclopedia contends that the opinion that the Old Testament commanded hatred of the enemy derives from a misunderstanding of the [[Sermon on the Mount]], wherein [[Jesus]] said: "Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies and pray for them that persecute you".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 5:43-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish Encyclopedia also cites passages in the Talmud stating: "If a man finds both a friend and an enemy requiring assistance he should assist his enemy first in order to subdue his evil inclination",&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt; and: "Who is strong? He who converts an enemy into a friend".&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt;

The concept of [[Ahimsa]] found in [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] also captures this sentiment, requiring kindness and non-violence towards all living things on the basis that they all are connected. [[India]]n leader [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] strongly believed in this principle,&lt;ref&gt;[https://newsblaze.com/world/south-asia/gandhis-philosophy-of-ahimsa-and-its-application-to-current-conflicts_3016/ Gandhi's Philosophy of Ahimsa and Its Application to Current Conflicts]. Newsblaze.com (2007-10-14). Retrieved on 2011-06-15.&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "[t]o one who follows this doctrine there is no room for an enemy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], ''The Satyagraha Ashram'', reported in ''The Gandhi Reader: A Source Book of His Life and Writings'', 2nd ed. (Madras: Samata Books, 1984), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1566">"'''From Clare to Here'''" is a ballad about Irish emigration written by [[Ralph McTell]]. It has also been recorded by [[The Fureys|The Furey Brothers &amp; Davey Arthur]] on the 1977 album ''Emigrant''; by [[Nanci Griffith]] and [[Pete Cummins]] on the 1993 album ''[[Other Voices, Other Rooms (Nanci Griffith album)|Other Voices, Other Rooms]]''; as a b-side by [[Duke Special]] on the 2006 single ''[[Last Night I Nearly Died (But I Woke Up Just in Time)|Last Night I Nearly Died]]''; and by Ben Glover on his 2016 album ''The Emigrant''.

McTell's original version appears on his 1976 album ''[[Right Side Up]]''. In the sleevenotes of the remaster, he wryly describes it as his "second [[Streets of London (song)|most covered song]]".

==Background==
In 1963, McTell was working on a building site, and it is of this time that he wrote, in the mid-1970s, "From Clare to Here". "There was an Irish gang on the site, and the ''[[craic]]'', as they call it, relieved the stress of the hard work. I was working with an Irishman called Michael, as so many of them are. And I said to him, 'It must be very strange to be here in London after the place you come from.' And he responded by saying, 'Yes, it's a long way from [[County Clare|Clare]] to here.'"&lt;ref&gt;"From Clare to Here" (live), ''Live at Troubador Festival 1997''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hatzi-''' or '''Chatzi-''' ({{lang-el|Χατζη-}}) is a [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] of [[Greece|Greek]] family names. It derives ultimately from the Arabic ''[[Hajji]]'', denoting one who has successfully completed a [[pilgrimage]].

In Christianity, the prefix is added when someone had committed the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. For example, if the surname was Stefanou, the name would then be Hatzistefanou after the journey.

'''Hehe''' is a [[Bantu language]] spoken by the [[Hehe people]] of the [[Iringa]] region of [[Tanzania]], lying south of the [[Great Ruaha River]].&lt;ref name=dwyer/&gt; It was reported to have "Ngoni" features, that is, words of a Zulu-like language introduced when conquered by a Nguni or Zulu-like people in the early 19th century. However, other "Ngoni" speeches seem to have lost most of these distinctive features over the past 150-odd years, the language more resembling those of the neighbouring peoples. In 1977 it was estimated that 190,000 people spoke Hehe. There has been some Bible translation (British and Foreign Bible Society).  Hehe may be mutually intelligible with [[Bena language|Bena]].&lt;ref name=dwyer&gt;Dwyer, D. J., Yankee, E., &amp; Michigan State Univ., E. r. (1985). African Language Resource Handbook: A Resource Handbook of the Eighty-two Highest Priority African Languages. Prepublication Edition. http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED256170.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Hehe has 15 noun classes (akin to the genders of European languages); it marks this class with a prefix.&lt;ref&gt;David Odden, ''Introducing Phonology'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of China |expanded = Legislative }}

The '''''Legislation Law of the People's Republic of China''''' is a law passed by the  [[National People's Congress]] which describes the relationship between laws and regulations as well as the roles of various institutions in the [[Chinese government]].

Among the interesting parts of the law is Article 8 which establishes the principle that only a law passed by the NPC can be used to criminalize activity.  This article was invoked in the case of [[Sun Zhigang]] to overturn regulations on the detention of migrants.

In addition Articles 78 to 92 outline a procedure for resolving conflicts between laws which is primarily legislative in nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2430">'''Maugris''' or '''Maugis''' was one of the heroes of the ''[[chansons de geste]]'' and [[romance (heroic literature)|romance]]s of [[chivalry]] and the [[Matter of France]] that tell of the legendary court of King [[Charlemagne]].  Maugis was cousin to [[Renaud de Montauban]] and his brothers, son of Beuves of Aygremont and brother to Vivien de Monbranc. He was brought up by [[Oriande]] the [[fairy]], and became a great [[Enchanter (fantasy)|enchanter]].  He won the magical horse [[Bayard (legend)|Bayard]] and the sword Froberge which he later gave to Renaud.

==French texts==
{{main|The Four Sons of Aymon|Renaud de Montauban}}
The oldest extant version of the story of Maugris was the anonymous [[Old French]] ''[[chanson de geste]]'' ''[[Quatre Fils Aymon]]'' dating from the late 12th century.  It tells the tale of the four sons of Duke Aymon (Renaud de Montauban, Guichard, Allard and Richardet), their magical horse Bayard, and their adventures and revolt against the emperor Charlemagne.  

From the 13th century on, other texts concerning Maugris were created; together with the original, these are grouped as the "[[Renaud de Montauban]] cycle".  These poems are: ''Maugis d'Aigremont'' (story of the youth of Maugis), ''Mort de Maugis'' (story of the death of Maugis), ''Vivien de Monbranc'' (story of the brother of Maugis), ''Bueve d'Aigremont'' (story of the father of Maugis, Bueve d'Aigremont, brother to [[Girart de Roussillon]] and Doon de Nanteuil).&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr and Zink, 1257-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italian texts==
Along with Renaud (as ''Rinaldo''), Maugris, as ''Malagi'' or ''Malagigi'', is an important character in Italian Renaissance epics, including  ''[[Morgante]]'' by [[Luigi Pulci]], ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'' by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]] and ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' by [[Ludovico Ariosto]].

'''Pangaea Ultima''' (also called '''Pangaea Proxima''', '''Neopangaea''', and '''Pangaea II''') is a possible future [[supercontinent]] configuration. Consistent with the [[supercontinent cycle]], Pangaea Ultima could occur within the next 250 million years. This potential configuration, hypothesized by [[Christopher Scotese]], earned its name from its similarity to the previous [[Pangaea]] supercontinent. Scotese later renamed Pangaea Ultima (Last Pangaea) to Pangaea Proxima (Next Pangaea) to alleviate confusion about the name Pangaea Ultima which could imply that it would be the last supercontinent.&lt;ref name="WilliamsNield2007"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026240790762661X | title=Earth's next supercontinent | last=Willams | first=Caroline | last2=Nield | first2=Ted | journal=New Scientist | year=2007 | volume=196 | issue=2626 | pages=36–40 | doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(07)62661-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was based on examination of past cycles of formation and breakup of supercontinents, not on current understanding of the mechanisms of tectonic change, which are too imprecise to project that far into the future.  "It's all pretty much fantasy to start with," Scotese has said. "But it's a fun exercise to think about what might happen.  And you can only do it if you have a really clear idea of why things happen in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast06oct_1 |title=Continents in collision: Pangaea Ultima |publisher=NASA Science News |date=October 6, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supercontinents describe the merger of all, or nearly all, of the [[Earth]]'s landmass into a single contiguous [[continent]].  In the Pangaea Ultima scenario, [[subduction]] at the western Atlantic, east of the [[Americas]], leads to the subduction of the [[Atlantic mid-ocean ridge]] followed by subduction destroying the Atlantic and Indian [[oceanic basin|basin]], causing the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s to close, bringing the [[Americas]] back together with [[Africa]] and [[Europe]]. As with most supercontinents, the interior of Pangaea Proxima would probably become a semi-arid [[desert]] prone to extreme temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Mars: a warmer, wetter planet |chapter=New World |first=Jeffrey S. |last=Kargel |publisher=Springer |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-85233-568-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
{{Life timeline}}
According to the Pangaea Ultima hypothesis, the Atlantic and [[Indian Ocean]]s will continue to get wider until new [[subduction zone]]s bring the continents back together, forming a future Pangaea. Most continents and microcontinents are predicted to collide with [[Eurasia]], just as they did when most continents collided to [[Laurentia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Broad|first=William J. |date=January 9, 2007 |title=Long-Term Global Forecast? Fewer Continents |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/09/science/09geo.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 50 million years from now, [[North America]] is predicted to shift slightly west and Eurasia would shift to the east, and possibly even to the south, bringing [[Great Britain]] closer to the [[North Pole]] and [[Siberia]] southward towards warm, [[subtropical]] latitudes. Africa is predicted to collide with [[Europe]] and [[Arabia]], closing the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (completely closing the [[Tethys Ocean]] (or Neotethys) and the [[Red Sea]]) and forming a supercontinent called [[Afro-Eurasia]]. A long mountain range would then extend from [[Iberia]], across [[Southern Europe]] (the Mediterranean Mountain Range) into [[Asia]]. Some are even predicted to have peaks higher than [[Mount Everest]]. Similarly, [[Australia]] is predicted to beach itself past the doorstep of [[Southeast Asia]], causing the islands to be compressed inland, forming another potential mountain range, and forming a supercontinent, called Afro-Euraustralasia. Meanwhile, [[Southern California|Southern]] and [[Baja California]] are predicted to have already collided with [[Alaska]] with new mountain ranges formed between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/vwdocs/vwlessons/lessons/Pangea/Pangea9.html |title=Our globe in next 50 million years |work=Volcano World |publisher=Oregon State University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405145237/http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/vwdocs/vwlessons/lessons/Pangea/Pangea9.html |archivedate=2009-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 150 million years from now, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] is predicted to stop widening and begin to shrink because some of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] will have been subducted. In this scenario, a [[mid-ocean ridge]] between [[South America]] and [[Africa]] will probably be subducted first; the Atlantic Ocean is predicted to have narrowed as a result of subduction beneath the Americas.  The Indian Ocean is also predicted to be smaller due to northward subduction of oceanic crust into the Central Indian trench. [[Antarctica]] is expected to shift upwards, colliding with [[Madagascar]] and Australia, enclosing a remnant of the Indian Ocean (called the Indo-Atlantic Ocean), and creating a supercontient named Terra Orientalis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotese.com/future1.htm |title=The Atlantic Ocean begins to Close |first=Christopher R |last=Scotese |work=Paleomap Project |accessdate=2012-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the last of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is subducted beneath the Americas, the Atlantic Ocean is predicted to close rapidly.&lt;ref name="scotese"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotese.com/future2.htm |title=Pangaea Ultima\Pangaea Proxima will form 250 million years in the Future |work=Paleomap Project |first=Christopher R |last=Scotese |accessdate=2006-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 250 million years in the future, the Atlantic is predicted to have closed. North America is predicted to have already collided with Africa, but be in a more southerly position than where it drifted. South America is predicted to be wrapped around the southern tip of Africa, completely enclosing the Indo-Atlantic Ocean. The [[Pacific Ocean]] will have grown wider, encircling half the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="scotese"/&gt;

==Other suggested supercontinents==
[[paleogeology|Paleogeologist]] Ronald Blakey has described the next 15 to 100 million years of tectonic development as fairly settled and predictable, without supercontinent formation.&lt;ref name=Manaugh&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/09/what-did-the-continents-look-like-millions-of-years-ago/279892/ |title=What Did the Continents Look Like Millions of Years Ago? |work=The Atlantic |date=23 September 2013 |author=Manaugh, Geoff et al. |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond that, he cautions that the geologic record is full of unexpected shifts in tectonic activity that make further projections "very, very speculative".&lt;ref name=Manaugh/&gt; In addition to Pangaea Ultima, two other hypothetical supercontinents&amp;mdash;"[[Amasia (continent)|Amasia]]" and "[[Novopangaea]]"&amp;mdash;were illustrated in an October 2007 ''[[New Scientist]]'' article.&lt;ref name="NewSci"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19626261-500-pangaea-the-comeback/|title = Pangaea, the comeback|date = 2007-10-20|work = NewScientist|author1=Williams, Caroline |author2=Nield, Ted |accessdate = 2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Progressive Party of Ivory Coast''' ({{lang-fr|Parti Progressiste de Côte d'Ivoire}}) was a pro-France [[political party]] in [[Ivory Coast]].

==History==
The party was established in 1946 as a successor to the Patriotic Action Committee of Ivory Coast (Comité d'Action Patriotique de la Côte d'Ivoire, CAPACI),&lt;ref&gt; Catherine Boone (2003) ''Political Topographies of the African State: Territorial Authority and Institutional Choice'', Cambridge University Press, p199&lt;/ref&gt; which had supported Kouamé Benzème in the [[French legislative election, 1945 (Ivory Coast)|French National Assembly elections]] in 1945. The main leaders of the PPCI were Kacou Aoulou, Joseph Coffi, Julien Yacobi and Etty Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Laurent |last=Gbagbo |authorlink=Laurent Gbagbo |title=Cote-d'Ivoire: Pour une alternative democratique |publisher=L'Harmattan |location=[[Paris]] |year=1983 |pages= |isbn=2-85802-303-4 |oclc=11345813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 PPCI merged with [[Entente of Independents of Côte d'Ivoire]] (EDICI) to form the [[Party of the French Union of Côte d'Ivoire]] (PUFCI).

The '''public holidays in Gibraltar''' are a mix of "bank holidays" and "public holidays" and are often used interchangeably, although strictly and legally there is a difference. Bank holidays are holidays when banks and many other businesses are closed for the day. Public holidays are holidays which have been observed through custom and practice.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[districts of Suriname|ten districts]] of [[Suriname]] are divided into 62 '''resorts''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''ressorten''). Within the capital city of [[Paramaribo]], a resort entails a neighbourhood, in other cases it is more akin to a municipality, consisting of a central place with a few settlements around it. The resorts in the [[Sipaliwini District]] are especially large, since the inlands of Suriname are sparsely inhabited.

The average resort is about 2600&amp;nbsp;km² and has almost 8,000 inhabitants. According to article 161 of the [[Constitution of Suriname]], the highest political body of the resort is the [[resort council]]. Elections for the resort council are held every five years and are usually at the same time as the [[Suriname general election]]s.

It borders the [[Black Sea]] to the southeast, [[Bulgaria]] to the south, [[Ukraine]] to the north, [[Hungary]] to the west, [[Serbia]] to the southwest, and [[Moldova]] to the east. It has a predominantly [[temperate climate|temperate]]-[[continental climate]]. With a total area of 238,397 square kilometres (92,046&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi), Romania is the [[List of European countries by area|12th largest country]] and also the [[List of European Union member states by population|7th most populous]] member state of the [[European Union]], having almost 20 million inhabitants. Its capital and largest city is [[Bucharest]] and other major [[Metropolitan areas in Romania|urban areas]] include [[Iași]], [[Timișoara]], [[Cluj-Napoca]], and [[Constanța]].

Modern Romania was formed in 1859 through a [[United Principalities|personal union]] of the Danubian Principalities of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]. The new state, officially named Romania since 1866, gained independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1877. Following [[World War I]], when Romania fought on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]], [[Bukovina]], [[Bessarabia]], [[Transylvania]] and  parts of [[Banat]], [[Crișana]] and [[Maramureș]] became part of the sovereign [[Kingdom of Romania]]. In June–August 1940, as a consequence of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and [[Second Vienna Award]], Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Northern Transylvania]] to Hungary. In November 1940, Romania signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] and, consequently, in June 1941 entered [[World War II]] on the [[Axis powers|Axis side]], fighting against the Soviet Union until August 1944, when it [[King Michael's Coup|joined]] the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and recovered Northern Transylvania. Following the war, under the occupation of the [[Red Army]]'s forces, Romania became a [[Socialist Republic of Romania|socialist republic]] and member of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. After the [[Romanian Revolution|1989 Revolution]], Romania [[History of Romania since 1989|began a transition]] towards [[democracy]] and a [[market economy]].

Romania remained neutral for the first two years of [[World War I]]. Following the secret [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|Treaty of Bucharest]], according to which Romania would acquire territories with a majority of Romanian population from [[Austria-Hungary]], it joined the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] and declared war on 27 August 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Horne|first =Charles F.|year =|title =Romania's Declaration of War with Austria-Hungary|volume =V|publisher =Source Records of the Great War|url =http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/romaniawardeclaration.htm|access-date =31 August 2008|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081207045455/http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/romaniawardeclaration.htm|archivedate =7 December 2008|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initial advances the [[Romania during World War I|Romanian military campaign]] quickly turned disastrous for Romania as the [[Central Powers]] occupied two-thirds of the country within months, before reaching a stalemate in 1917.

In 1965, [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] came to power and started to conduct the foreign policy more independently from the Soviet Union.

The latter eventually initiated a policy of total reimbursement of the foreign debt by imposing [[1980s austerity policy in Romania|austerity steps]] that impoverished the population and exhausted the economy. The process succeeded in repaying all foreign government debt of Romania in 1989. At the same time, Ceaușescu greatly extended the authority of the Securitate secret police and imposed a severe [[Nicolae Ceaușescu's cult of personality|cult of personality]], which led to a dramatic decrease in the dictator's popularity and culminated in his overthrow and eventual execution, together with his wife, in the violent [[Romanian Revolution]] of December 1989 in which thousands were killed or injured. The charges for which they were executed were, among others, genocide by starvation.

The subsequent disintegration of the Front produced several political parties, including most notably the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]]. The former governed Romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalitions and governments with Ion Iliescu as head of state. Since then, there have been several other democratic changes of government: in 1996 [[Emil Constantinescu]] was elected president, in 2000 Iliescu returned to power, while [[Traian Băsescu]] was elected in 2004 and narrowly re-elected in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-international-6689374-presa-internationala-despre-alegerile-din-romania-traian-basescu-castigat-limita-romanii-mici-sperante-dezghete-ajutorul-fmi.htm Presa internationala despre alegerile din Romania: Traian Basescu a castigat la limita; Romanii au mici sperante sa se dezghete ajutorul de la FMI – International] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002223/http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-international-6689374-presa-internationala-despre-alegerile-din-romania-traian-basescu-castigat-limita-romanii-mici-sperante-dezghete-ajutorul-fmi.htm |date=4 March 2016 }}.

Former President Traian Băsescu (2004–2014) has twice been impeached by the [[Parliament of Romania]] (in 2007 and in 2012), the second time on the background of street protests which occurred earlier in the year.

Since December 1989, Romania has pursued a policy of strengthening relations with the [[Western world|West]] in general, more specifically with the United States and the [[European Union]] albeit with its limited [[Romania–Russia relations|relations with]] [[Russia]]. It joined the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) on 29 March 2004, the European Union (EU) on 1 January 2007, while it had joined the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] in 1972, and is a founding member of the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wto.org/English/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org6_e.htm |title=Understanding the WTO – members |publisher=WTO |access-date=29 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqfQ6Tl4?url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org6_e.htm |archivedate=17 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those territories varied over time, and at one point included all of what is now [[East Africa Protectorate|Kenya]] as well as the [[Zanzibar Archipelago]] of the [[Swahili Coast]]. Later, the kingdom's realm included only a [[British Kenya|ten mile wide coastal strip of Kenya]] and [[Zanzibar]]. Under an agreement concluded on 8 October 1963, the Sultan relinquished sovereignty over his remaining territory in Kenya. On 12 January 1964, Sultan Jamshid bin Abdullah was deposed and lost sovereignty over the last of his dominions, Zanzibar.

== History ==
{{See also|History of Zanzibar}}
In 1698, Zanzibar became part of the overseas holdings of [[Oman]] after [[Saif bin Sultan]], the Imam of Oman, defeated the Portuguese in [[Mombasa]], in what is now [[Kenya]]. In 1832&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ingrams|1967|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1840,&lt;ref name="AppiahGatesp2045"&gt;{{Harvnb|Appiah|Gates|1999|p=2045}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omani ruler [[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman|Said bin Sultan]] moved his court from [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] to [[Stone Town]] on the island of [[Unguja]]. He established a ruling Arab elite and encouraged the development of [[clove]] [[plantation]]s, using the island's [[slave labour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ingrams|1967|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zanzibar's commerce fell increasingly into the hands of traders from the [[Indian subcontinent]], whom Said encouraged to settle on the island. After his death in 1856, two of his sons, [[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar|Majid bin Said]] and [[Thuwaini bin Said, Sultan of Muscat and Oman|Thuwaini bin Said]], struggled over the [[Order of succession|succession]], so Zanzibar and Oman were divided into two separate [[realms]]. Thuwaini became the Sultan of [[Muscat and Oman]] while Majid became the first [[List of Sultans of Zanzibar|Sultan of Zanzibar]], but obliged to pay an annual tribute to the Omani court in Muscat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35834.htm|title=Background Note: Oman|publisher=U.S Department of State - Diplomacy in Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ingrams|1967|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his 14-year reign as Sultan, Majid consolidated his power around the [[Arab slave trade|local slave trade]]. His successor, [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Barghash bin Said]], helped abolish the slave trade in Zanzibar and largely developed the country's infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Michlerp37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Michler|2007|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third Sultan, [[Khalifah bin Said of Zanzibar|Khalifa bin Said]], also furthered the country's progress toward abolishing slavery.&lt;ref name="Ingramsp172"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ingrams|1967|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 16th-century explorer [[Leo Africanus]], the native inhabitants of the Zanzibar (Zanguebar) sultanate were for the most part pagans with curly hair and a black complexion. However, the denizens of the northernmost Zanzibar kingdom of Malindi were Muslims of an almost white complexion, with some pagan black inhabitants among them.&lt;ref name="Leo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Africanus|first1=Leo|title=The History and Description of Africa|date=1526|publisher=Hakluyt Society|pages=51–54|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyanddescr03porygoog#page/n184/mode/2up|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Context for the Sultan's loss of control over his dominions===
[[File:Sultanat de Zanzibar vèrs 1875.png|thumb|Zanzibar's Sultanate circa 1875]]
Until 1884, the Sultans of Zanzibar controlled a substantial portion of the [[Swahili Coast]], known as [[Zanj]], and [[trading route]]s extending further into the continent, as far as [[Kindu]] on the [[Congo River]]. That year, however, the [[Society for German Colonization]] forced local chiefs on the mainland to agree to German protection, prompting Sultan [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Bargash bin Said]] to protest. Coinciding with the [[Berlin Conference]] and the [[Scramble for Africa]], further German interest in the area was soon shown in 1885 by the arrival of the newly created [[German East Africa Company]], which had a mission to colonize the area.

In 1886, the British and Germans secretly met and discussed their aims of expansion in the [[African Great Lakes]], with spheres of influence already agreed upon the year before, with the British to take what would become the [[East Africa Protectorate]] (now [[Kenya]]) and the Germans to take present-day [[Tanzania]]. Both powers leased coastal territory from Zanzibar and established trading stations and outposts. Over the next few years, all of the mainland possessions of Zanzibar came to be administered by European imperial powers, beginning in 1888 when the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] took over administration of [[Mombasa]].&lt;ref name="BEA_Sinclair"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heliograph.com/trmgs/trmgs2/bea.shtml|title=British East Africa|website=www.heliograph.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year the German East Africa Company acquired formal direct rule over the coastal area previously submitted to German protection. This resulted in a native uprising, the [[Abushiri Revolt]], which was crushed by a joint Anglo-German naval operation which heralded the end of Zanzibar's influence on the mainland.

==== 1890 - Establishment by the British of the Zanzibar Protectorate on part of the Sultan's dominions====
With the signing of the [[Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty]] between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and the [[German Empire]] in 1890, Zanzibar itself became a British [[protectorate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ingrams|1967|pp=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1896, following the death of Sultan [[Hamad bin Thuwaini]], Britain and Zanzibar fought a [[Anglo-Zanzibar War|38-minute war]], the shortest in recorded history. A struggle for succession took place as the Sultan's cousin [[Khalid bin Barghash]] seized power. The British instead wanted [[Hamoud bin Mohammed of Zanzibar|Hamoud bin Mohammed]] to become Sultan, believing that he would be much easier to work with. The British gave Khalid an hour to vacate the Sultan's palace in Stone Town. Khalid failed to do so, and instead assembled an army of 2,800 men to fight the British. The British launched an attack on the palace and other locations around the city after which Khalid retreated and later went into exile. Hamoud was then peacefully installed as Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Michler|2007|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That "Zanzibar" for these purposes included the ten-mile coastal strip of Kenya that would later become the [[British Kenya|Protectorate of Kenya]] was a matter recorded in the parliamentary debates at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1895/jun/13/british-east-africa#S4V0034P0_18950613_HOC_216|title=BRITISH EAST AFRICA. (Hansard, 13 June 1895)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1895 - Establishment by the British of the [[East Africa Protectorate]] on part of the Sultan's dominions====
[[File:The Harem and Tower Harbour of Zanzibar (p.234, 1890) - Copy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Harem and Tower Harbour of Zanzibar (p.234), London Missionary Society&lt;ref name=LMS&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Harem and Tower Harbour of Zanzibar|journal=Chronicles of the London Missionary Society|date=1890|url=https://archive.org/details/chroniclelondon00unkngoog|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1886, the British government encouraged [[Sir William Mackinnon, 1st Baronet|William Mackinnon]], who already had an agreement with the Sultan and whose shipping company traded extensively in the [[African Great Lakes]], to establish British influence in the region. He formed a British East Africa Association which led to the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] being chartered in 1888 and given the original grant to administer the territory. It administered about {{convert|150|mi|km}} of coastline stretching from the [[Jubba River|River Jubba]] via Mombasa to [[German East Africa]] which were leased from the Sultan. The British "[[sphere of influence]]", agreed at the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885, extended up the coast and inland across the future Kenya and after 1890 included [[Uganda]] as well. Mombasa was the administrative centre at this time.&lt;ref name="BEA_Sinclair"/&gt;

However, the company began to fail, and on 1 July 1895 the British government proclaimed a [[protectorate]], the [[East Africa Protectorate]], the administration being transferred to the [[Foreign Office]]. In 1902 administration was again transferred to the [[Colonial Office]] and the Uganda territory was incorporated as part of the protectorate also. In 1897 [[Lord Delamere]], the pioneer of white settlement, arrived in the Kenya highlands, which was then part of the Protectorate.&lt;ref name="Roberts-Wray1966"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts-Wray |first=Sir Kenneth|title=Commonwealth and Colonial Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2WOuAAAAIAAJ|year=1966|publisher=F.A. Praeger}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|761}} Lord Delamere was impressed by the agricultural possibilities of the area. In 1902 the boundaries of the Protectorate were extended to include what was previously the Eastern Province of [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name="Roberts-Wray1966" /&gt;{{rp|761}}&lt;ref&gt;East Africa Order in Council, 1902, S.R.O. 1902 No. 661, S.R.O. ^ S.I. Rev. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 1902, the East Africa Syndicate received a grant of {{convert|500|sqmi|km2}} to promote white settlement in the [[Highland (geography)|Highlands]]. Lord Delamere now commenced extensive farming operations, and in 1905, when a large number of new settlers arrived from England and South Africa, the Protectorate was transferred from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office.&lt;ref name="Roberts-Wray1966" /&gt;{{rp|762}} The capital was shifted from Mombasa to [[Nairobi]] in 1905. A regular Government and Legislature were constituted by Order in Council in 1906.&lt;ref name="Roberts-Wray1966" /&gt;{{rp|761}} This constituted the administrator a governor and provided for legislative and executive councils. Lieutenant Colonel J. Hayes Sadler was the first governor and commander in chief. There were occasional troubles with local tribes but the country was opened up by the Government and the colonists with little bloodshed.&lt;ref name="Roberts-Wray1966" /&gt;{{rp|761}} After the First World War, more farmers arrived from England and South Africa, and by 1919 the European population was estimated at 9,000 settlers.&lt;ref name="Roberts-Wray1966" /&gt;{{rp|761}}

====1920 - Sultan loses sovereignty over what became the [[Colony of Kenya]]====

On 23 July 1920, the inland areas of the East Africa Protectorate were annexed as British dominions by Order in Council.&lt;ref&gt;Kenya (Annexation) Order in Council, 1920, S.R.O. 1902 No. 661, S.R.O. &amp; S.I. Rev. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; That part of the former Protectorate was thereby constituted as the [[Colony of Kenya]] and from that time, the Sultan of Zanzibar ceased to be sovereign over that territory. The remaining ten-mile wide coastal strip (with the exception of [[Wituland|Witu]]) remained a Protectorate under an agreement with the Sultan of Zanzibar.&lt;ref&gt;Agreement of 14 June 1890: State pp. vol. 82. p. 653&lt;/ref&gt; That coastal strip, remaining under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Zanzibar, was constituted as the Protectorate of Kenya in 1920.&lt;ref name="BEA_Sinclair"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Council 2343, p. 968"&gt;Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920 S.R.O. 1920 No. 2343, S.R.O. &amp; S.I. Rev. VIII, 258, State Pp., Vol. 87 p. 968&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protectorate of Kenya was governed as part of the [[Colony of Kenya]] by virtue of an agreement between the United Kingdom and the Sultan dated 14 December 1895.&lt;ref name="Roberts-Wray1966" /&gt;{{rp|762}}&lt;ref&gt;Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920, S.R.O. 1920 No. 2343 &amp; S.I. Rev. VIII, 258, State Pp., Vol. 87, p.968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PzTS61nkQPkC&amp;pg=PA783&amp;lpg=PA783&amp;dq=Kenya+Annexation+Order&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JcRZUE4kRF&amp;sig=knGiSaiIZV7esmOCJG_K2Wf7IgU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pV3zVMnRB4PjsATK34DwDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Kenya|title=Kenya Gazette|date=7 September 1921|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, the "Colony of Kenya" referred to the interior lands. The "Protectorate of Kenya" was a ten-mile coastal strip together with certain islands which remained under the sovereignty of the [[Sultan of Zanzibar]] until the independence of Kenya.

====1963 - Sultan cedes sovereignty over the [[British Kenya|Protectorate of Kenya]]====

The Colony of Kenya and the Protectorate of Kenya each came to an end on 12 December 1963. The United Kingdom ceded sovereignty over the Colony of Kenya and, under an agreement dated 8 October 1963, the Sultan agreed that simultaneous with independence for Kenya, the Sultan would cease to have sovereignty over the Protectorate of Kenya.&lt;ref name="Roberts-Wray1966" /&gt;{{rp|762}}&lt;ref&gt;HC Deb 22 November 1963 vol 684 cc1329-400 wherein the UK Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and for the Colonies stated" "An agreement was then signed on the 8th October, 1963, providing that on the date when Kenya became independent the territories composing the Kenya Coastal Strip would become part of Kenya proper."&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, Kenya became an independent country under the [[Kenya Independence Act 1963]]. Exactly 12 months later on 12 December 1964, Kenya became a republic under the name "Republic of Kenya".&lt;ref name="Roberts-Wray1966" /&gt;{{rp|762}}

====1963/1964 - Zanzibar Protectorate ended and Sultan deposed====
[[File:Zanzibar 1964 Jamhuri overprint stamp.jpg|thumb|180 px|Independence stamp overprinted "Republic"]]
On 10 December 1963, the Protectorate that had existed over Zanzibar since 1890 was terminated by the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom did not grant Zanzibar independence, as such, because the UK had never had sovereignty over Zanzibar. Rather, by the Zanzibar Act 1963 of the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;Zanzibar Act 1963: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1963/55/contents/&lt;/ref&gt; the UK ended the Protectorate and made provision for full-self government in Zanzibar as an independent country within the Commonwealth. Upon the Protectorate being abolished, Zanzibar became a [[constitutional monarchy]] under the Sultan.&lt;ref name="DeptofStatep986"&gt;{{Harvnb|United States Department of State|1975|p=986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sultan [[Jamshid bin Abdullah of Zanzibar|Jamshid bin Abdullah]] was overthrown a month later during the [[Zanzibar Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayany|1970|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamshid fled into exile, and the Sultanate was replaced by the [[People's Republic of Zanzibar and Pemba]]. In April 1964, this short-lived communist republic was united with [[Tanganyika]] to form the [[United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar]], which became known as [[Tanzania]] six months later.&lt;ref name="AppiahGatesp2045"/&gt;

==Demographics==
By 1964, the country was a [[constitutional monarchy]] ruled by Sultan [[Jamshid bin Abdullah of Zanzibar|Jamshid bin Abdullah]].&lt;ref name="shillington1716"/&gt; Zanzibar had a population of around 230,000 natives, some of whom claimed [[Persian people|Persian]] ancestry and were known locally as [[Shirazi (ethnic group)|Shirazi]]s.&lt;ref name="speller4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Speller|2007|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contained significant minorities in the 50,000 [[Arabs]] and 20,000 [[South Asians]] who were prominent in business and trade.&lt;ref name="speller4"/&gt;  The various ethnic groups were becoming mixed and the distinctions between them had blurred;&lt;ref name="shillington1716"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shillington|2005|p=1716}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to one historian, an important reason for the general support for Sultan Jamshid was his family's ethnic diversity.&lt;ref name="shillington1716"/&gt; However, the island's Arab inhabitants, as the major landowners, were generally wealthier than the natives;&lt;ref name="parsons106"&gt;{{Harvnb|Parsons|2003|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; the major political parties were organised largely along ethnic lines, with Arabs dominating the [[Zanzibar Nationalist Party]] (ZNP) and natives the [[Afro-Shirazi Party]] (ASP).&lt;ref name="shillington1716"/&gt;

It is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the [[United Nations]].

The [[geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]], formerly known as Formosa, was inhabited by [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|aborigines]] before the 17th century, when [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] colonies opened the island to mass [[Han people|Han]] immigration. After a brief rule by the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], the island was annexed in 1683 by the [[Qing dynasty]], the last dynasty of China. The Qing ceded Taiwan to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in 1895 after the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]]. While Taiwan was under Japanese rule, the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) was established on the mainland in 1912 after the [[Xinhai Revolution|fall of the Qing dynasty]]. Following the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender to the Allies]] in 1945, the ROC took control of Taiwan. However, the resumption of the [[Chinese Civil War]] led to the ROC's loss of the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]], and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949. Although the ROC continued to [[Two Chinas|claim to be the legitimate government of China]], its effective jurisdiction had, since the [[Landing Operation on Hainan Island|loss of Hainan in 1950]], been limited to [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan and several small islands]], with the main island making up 99% of its ''de facto'' territory. As a founding member of the United Nations, the ROC represented [[China and the United Nations|China at the UN]] until 1971, when it [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|lost its seat]] to the PRC.

In the early 1960s, Taiwan entered a period of [[Taiwan Miracle|rapid economic growth]] and [[industrialization]], creating a [[developed country|stable industrial economy]]. In the 1980s and early 1990s, it changed from a [[one-party state|one-party]] military dictatorship dominated by the [[Kuomintang]] to a [[List of political parties in the Republic of China|multi-party democracy]] with a [[semi-presidential system]]. Taiwan is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|22nd-largest economy]] in the world, and its [[high-tech]] industry plays a key role in the global economy.

The PRC has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and asserted the ROC is no longer in legitimate existence. Under its [[One-China policy]] the PRC refuses [[diplomatic relations]] with any country that [[diplomatic recognition|recognizes]] the ROC. Today, 17 countries maintain [[Foreign relations of Taiwan|official ties with the ROC]] but many other states maintain unofficial ties through [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office|representative offices]] and institutions that function as [[de facto embassy|de facto embassies]] and consulates. Although Taiwan is fully self-governing, most international organizations in which the PRC participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate only as a [[non-state actor]]. Internally, the major division in politics is between the aspirations of eventual [[Chinese unification]] or [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwanese independence]], though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal. The PRC has threatened the use of military force in response to any formal declaration of independence by Taiwan or if PRC leaders decide that peaceful unification is no longer possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200503/14/eng20050314_176746.html |title=Full text of Anti-Secession Law |work=People's Daily |date=14 March 2005 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRC and ROC standoff dates from the [[Chinese Civil War]] and has extended through the [[First Taiwan Strait Crisis|first]], [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis|second]] and [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis|third]] Taiwan Strait crises to the present day.

Various names for the island of Taiwan remain in use today, each derived from explorers or rulers during a particular historical period. The name Formosa ({{lang|zh-hant|[[:wikt:福爾摩沙|福爾摩沙]]}}) dates from 1542,{{check|date=December 2015}} when [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] sailors sighted an uncharted island and noted it on their maps as ''Ilha Formosa'' ("beautiful island").&lt;ref name="yb:history"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 3: History |chapterurl=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/docs/ch03.pdf |title=The Republic of China Yearbook 2011 |year=2011 |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514004941/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/docs/ch03.pdf |archivedate=14 May 2012 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npm.gov.tw/exhbition/formosa/english/02.htm National Palace Museum, Taiwan: 'The Emergence of Taiwan on the World Scene in the Seventeenth Century'&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Formosa" eventually "replaced all others in European literature"{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=10|ps=: "A Dutch navigating officer named [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten|Linschotten]] [sic], employed by the Portuguese, so recorded the island in his charts, and eventually the name of Formosa, so euphonious and yet appropriate, replaced all others in European literature."}} and remained in common use among English speakers into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;see for example:

In the early 17th century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a commercial post at [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]] (modern-day [[Anping District|Anping]], [[Tainan]]) on a coastal sandbar called "Tayouan",{{sfnp|Valentijn|1903|p=52}} after their [[ethnonym]] for a nearby [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese aboriginal]] tribe, possibly [[Taivoan people]], written by the Dutch and Portuguese variously as ''Taiouwang'', ''Tayowan'', ''Teijoan'', etc.&lt;ref name="Mair"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mair |first=V.

Mair |date=2003 |title=How to Forget Your Mother Tongue and Remember Your National Language |url=http://pinyin.info/readings/mair/taiwanese.html |quote=The true derivation of the name "Taiwan" is actually from the ethnonym of a tribe in the southwest part of the island in the area around Ping'an. As early as 1636, a Dutch missionary referred to this group as Taiouwang. From the name of the tribe, the Portuguese called the area around Ping'an as Tayowan, Taiyowan, Tyovon, Teijoan, Toyouan, and so forth. Indeed, already in his ship's log of 1622, the Dutchman [[Cornelis Reijersen]] referred to the area as Teijoan and Taiyowan. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This name was also adopted into the Chinese vernacular (in particular, [[Hokkien]], as {{zh|poj={{linktext|Tāi-oân}}/{{linktext|Tâi-oân}}}}) as the name of the sandbar and nearby area ([[Tainan]]). The modern word "Taiwan" is derived from this usage, which is seen in various forms ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|大員}}, {{linktext|大圓}}, {{linktext|大灣}}, {{linktext|臺員}}, {{linktext|臺圓}}}} and {{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|臺窩灣}}}}) in Chinese historical records. The area occupied by modern-day Tainan represented the first permanent settlement by both European colonists and Chinese immigrants. The settlement grew to be the island's most important trading centre and served as its capital until 1887. Use of the current Chinese name ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|臺灣}}}}) was formalized as early as 1684 with the establishment of [[Taiwan Prefecture]]. Through its rapid development the entire Formosan mainland eventually became known as "Taiwan".&lt;ref name="蔡玉仙等編"&gt;{{cite book |script-title=zh:府城文史 | editor=蔡玉仙 |display-editors=etal |year=2007 |publisher=[[Tainan City Government]] |language=Chinese |isbn=9789860094343}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="石守謙主編"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Shih Shou-chien |editorlink=Shih Shou-chien |year=2003 |trans-title = Ilha Formosa: the Emergence of Taiwan on the World Scene in the 17th Century |script-title=zh:福爾摩沙 : 十七世紀的臺灣、荷蘭與東亞 |language=Chinese |publisher = National Palace Museum |place=Taipei |isbn=9789575624415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kato |first=Mitsutaka |origyear=1940 |year=2007 |script-title =zh:昨日府城 明星台南: 發現日治下的老臺南 |language=Chinese |translator=黃秉珩 |publisher=臺南市文化資產保護協會 |isbn=9789572807996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oosterhoff"&gt;{{cite book |title=Colonial Cities: Essays on Urbanism in a Colonial Context |editor1-first=Robert |editor1-last=Ross |editor2-first=Gerard J. |editor2-last=Telkamp |chapter=Zeelandia, a Dutch colonial city on Formosa (1624–1662) |first=J.L. |last=Oosterhoff |pages=51–62 |publisher=Springer |year=1985 |isbn=978-90-247-2635-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Daoyi Zhilüe]]'' (1349), [[Wang Dayuan]] used "[[Liuqiu]]" as a name for the island of Taiwan, or the part of it closest to [[Penghu]].{{sfnp|Thompson|1964|p=166}}
Elsewhere, the name was used for the [[Ryukyu Islands]] in general or [[Okinawa]], the largest of them; indeed the name ''Ryūkyū'' is the Japanese form of ''Liúqiú''.
The name also appears in the ''[[Book of Sui]]'' (636) and other early works, but scholars cannot agree on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan or even [[Luzon]].{{sfnp|Thompson|1964|p=163}}

The official name of the state is the "Republic of China"; it has also been known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC's establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland, the government used the short form "China" (''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|Zhōngguó}}'' ({{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|中國}}}}}})) to refer to itself, which derives from ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|zhōng}}'' ("central" or "middle") and ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|guó}}'' ("state, nation-state"),{{efn|Although this is the present meaning of ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|guó}}'', in [[Old Chinese]] (when its pronunciation was something like {{nowrap|/*qʷˤək/}})&lt;ref name=bs&gt;[[Reconstructions of Old Chinese|Baxter-Sagart]].&lt;/ref&gt; it meant the walled city of the Chinese and the areas they could control from them.&lt;ref name=wilx/&gt;}} a term which also developed under the [[Zhou dynasty]] in reference to its [[demesne|royal demesne]],{{efn|Its use is attested from the 6th-century [[Classic of History]], which states "[[Tian (god)|Huangtian]] bestowed the lands and the peoples of the central state to the ancestors" ({{lang|zh|皇天既付中國民越厥疆土于先王}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|zh|[[:s:zh:尚書|《尚書》]], [[:s:zh:尚書/梓材|梓材]].}} {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and the name was then applied to the area around [[Luoyi]] (present-day Luoyang) during the [[Eastern Zhou]] and then to China's [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] before being used as an occasional synonym for the state during the [[Qing dynasty|Qing era]].&lt;ref name=wilx&gt;{{citation |last=Wilkinson |first=Endymion |title=Chinese History: A Manual |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERnrQq0bsPYC&amp;printsec=frontcover |date=2000 |location=[[Cambridge, Mass.|Cambridge]] |publisher=Harvard University Asia Center |series=Harvard-Yenching Institute Monograph No. 52 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ERnrQq0bsPYC&amp;pg=PA132 132] |isbn=9780674002494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s and 1960s, after the government had withdrawn to Taiwan upon losing the [[Chinese Civil War]], it was commonly referred to as "Nationalist China" (or "[[Free area of the Republic of China|Free China]]") to differentiate it from "Communist China" (or "[[China|Red China]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Garver|first=John W. |title=The Sino-American Alliance: Nationalist China and American Cold War Strategy in Asia|publisher=M.E.

Over subsequent decades, the Republic of China has become commonly known as "Taiwan", after the island that comprises 99% of the territory under its control.

Taiwan was joined to the mainland in the [[Late Pleistocene]], until [[sea level]]s rose about 10,000 years ago.

Around 6,000 years ago, Taiwan was settled by farmers, most likely from mainland China.{{sfnp|Jiao|2007|pp=91–94}} They are believed to be the ancestors of today's [[Taiwanese aborigines]], whose languages belong to the [[Austronesian language family]], but show much greater diversity than the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|rest of the family]], which spans a huge area from [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] west to [[Madagascar]] and east as far as [[New Zealand]], [[Hawaii]] and [[Easter Island]].

The [[Dutch East India Company]] attempted to establish a trading outpost on the [[Penghu]] Islands (Pescadores) in 1622, but were [[Sino–Dutch conflicts|driven off by Ming forces]].&lt;ref name="Wills"&gt;{{cite book | title=Taiwan: A New History | editor-first=Murray A. | editor-last=Rubinstein | chapter=The Seventeenth-century Transformation: Taiwan under the Dutch and the Cheng Regime | first=John E., Jr. | last=Wills | publisher=M.E.

In 1624, the company established a stronghold called [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]] on the coastal islet of Tayouan, which is now part of the main island at [[Anping, Tainan]].&lt;ref name="Oosterhoff" /&gt;
When the Dutch arrived, they found southwestern Taiwan already frequented by a transient Chinese population numbering close to 1,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Andrade|first=Tonio |date=2007 |title=How Taiwan Became Chinese |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/17552533/How-Taiwan-Became-Chinese-by-Tonio-Andrade-Project-Gutenberg-Edition |publisher=Columbia University Press |series=(Project Gutenberg Edition) |page=129 |isbn=978-9622090835 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
David Wright, a Scottish agent of the company who lived on the island in the 1650s, described the lowland areas of the island as being divided among 11 [[chiefdom]]s ranging in size from two settlements to 72. Some of these fell under Dutch control, while others remained independent.&lt;ref name="Oosterhoff" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Formosa Under the Dutch: Described from Contemporary Records, with Explanatory Notes and a Bibliography of the Island |year=1903 |first=William |last=Campbell |authorlink=William Campbell (missionary)|publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner |url=https://archive.org/details/formosaunderdut01campgoog |pages=6–7 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Company began to import labourers from [[Fujian]] and [[Penghu]] (Pescadores), many of whom settled.&lt;ref name="Wills" /&gt;

In 1626, the [[Spanish Empire]] landed on and occupied northern Taiwan, at the ports of [[Keelung]] and [[Tamsui]], as a base to extend their trading. This colonial period lasted 16 years until 1642, when the last Spanish fortress fell to Dutch forces.

Following the fall of the [[Ming dynasty]], [[Koxinga]] (Zheng Chenggong), a self-styled Ming loyalist, arrived on the island and [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia|captured Fort Zeelandia]] in 1662, expelling the [[Dutch Empire]] and military from the island. Koxinga established the [[Kingdom of Tungning]] (1662–1683), with his capital at [[Tainan]]. He and his heirs, [[Zheng Jing]], who ruled from 1662 to 1682, and [[Zheng Keshuang]], who ruled less than a year, continued to launch raids on the southeast coast of mainland China well into the [[Qing dynasty]] era.&lt;ref name="Wills" /&gt;

=== Qing rule ===
{{Main|Taiwan under Qing rule}}
[[File:Taiwanese aboriginese deerhunt1.png|thumb|upright|Hunting deer, painted in 1746]]
In 1683, following the defeat of Koxinga's grandson by an armada led by Admiral [[Shi Lang]] of southern [[Fujian]], the [[Qing dynasty]] formally annexed Taiwan, placing it under the jurisdiction of Fujian province. The Qing imperial government tried to reduce piracy and vagrancy in the area, issuing a series of edicts to manage immigration and respect aboriginal land rights. Immigrants mostly from southern Fujian continued to enter Taiwan. The border between taxpaying lands and "savage" lands shifted eastward, with some aborigines becoming [[sinicized]] while others retreated into the mountains. During this time, there were a number of conflicts between groups of [[Han Chinese]] from different regions of southern Fujian, particularly between those from [[Quanzhou]] and [[Zhangzhou]], and between southern Fujian Chinese and aborigines.

Northern Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were the scene of subsidiary campaigns in the [[Sino-French War]] (August 1884 to April 1885). The French occupied Keelung on 1 October 1884, but were [[Battle of Tamsui|repulsed from Tamsui]] a few days later. The French won some tactical victories but were unable to exploit them, and the [[Keelung Campaign]] ended in stalemate. The [[Pescadores Campaign]], beginning on 31 March 1885, was a French victory, but had no long-term consequences. The French evacuated both Keelung and the Penghu archipelago after the end of the war.

In 1887, the Qing upgraded the island's administration from [[Taiwan Prefecture]] of Fujian Province to [[Taiwan Province#History|Fujian-Taiwan-Province]], the twentieth in the empire, with its capital at [[Taipei]]. This was accompanied by a modernization drive that included building China's first railroad.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|pp=247, 620}}

As the Qing dynasty was defeated in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–1895), Taiwan, along with [[Penghu]] and [[Liaodong Peninsula]], were ceded in full sovereignty to the [[Empire of Japan]] by the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]].

Around 1935, the Japanese began an island-wide [[Japanization|assimilation project]] to bind the island more firmly to the Japanese Empire and people were taught to see themselves as Japanese under the Kominka Movement, during which time Taiwanese culture and religion were outlawed and the citizens were encouraged to adopt [[Japanese surname]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130731160817/http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=3803 Kominka Movement – 台灣大百科全書 Encyclopedia of Taiwan].

The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] operated heavily out of Taiwanese ports. In October 1944 the [[Formosa Air Battle]] was fought between American carriers and Japanese forces based in Taiwan.

While Taiwan was still under Japanese rule, the Republic of China was founded on the mainland on 1 January 1912, following the [[Xinhai Revolution]], which began with the [[Wuchang Uprising]] on 10 October 1911, replacing the [[Qing Dynasty]] and ending over two thousand years of [[Dynasties in Chinese history|imperial rule]] in China.&lt;ref name="cuhk"&gt;{{cite book |title=China, Fiver thousand years of History and Civilization|date=2007|publisher=City University Of Hong Kong Press|page=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-fAxn_9f8wC&amp;pg=PA116|accessdate=9 September 2014|isbn=9789629371401}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its founding until 1949 it was based in mainland China.

After the [[Surrender of Japan]] on 25 October 1945, the [[US Navy]] ferried ROC troops to Taiwan in order to accept the formal surrender of Japanese military forces in [[Taipei]] on behalf of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], as part of [[General Order No. 1]] for temporary [[military occupation]]. General [[Rikichi Andō]], governor-general of Taiwan and commander-in-chief of all Japanese forces on the island, signed the receipt and handed it over to General Chen Yi of the ROC military to complete the official turnover. Chen Yi proclaimed that day to be "[[Retrocession Day|Taiwan Retrocession Day]]", but the Allies considered Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to be under military occupation and still under Japanese sovereignty until 1952, when the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] took effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Although the [[1943 Cairo Declaration]] had envisaged returning these territories to China, in the Treaty of San Francisco and [[Treaty of Taipei]] Japan renounced all claim to them without specifying to what country they were to be surrendered. This introduced the problem of the [[legal status of Taiwan]].

The ROC administration of Taiwan under [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] was strained by increasing tensions between Taiwanese-born people and newly arrived mainlanders, which were compounded by economic woes, such as [[hyperinflation]]. Furthermore, cultural and linguistic conflicts between the two groups quickly led to the loss of popular support for the new government, while the mass movement led by the working committee of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] also aimed to bring down the Kuomintang government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

After the end of World War II, the Chinese Civil War resumed between the Chinese Nationalists (Kuomintang), led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]], and the Communist Party of China, led by [[Mao Zedong]].

After losing most of the mainland, the Kuomintang held remaining control of [[Tibet (1912–51)|Tibet]], the portions of [[Qinghai]], [[Xinjiang]], and [[Yunnan]] provinces along with the [[Hainan Island]] until 1951 before the Communists subsequently captured these territories. From this point onwards, the Kuomintang's territory was reduced to Taiwan, [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] ([[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian Province]]), and two major islands of [[Dongsha Islands]] and [[Nansha Islands]]. The Kuomintang continued to claim sovereignty over all "China", which it defined to include [[mainland China]], Taiwan, [[Outer Mongolia]] and [[Administrative divisions of the Republic of China|other areas]].

Initially, the United States abandoned the KMT and expected that Taiwan would fall to the Communists. However, in 1950 the conflict between [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]], which had been ongoing since the Japanese withdrawal in 1945, escalated into full-blown war, and in the context of the Cold War, US President [[Harry S.

As the Chinese Civil War continued without truce, the government built up military fortifications throughout Taiwan. Within this effort, KMT veterans built the now famous [[Central Cross-Island Highway]] through the [[Taroko Gorge]] in the 1950s. The two sides would continue to engage in sporadic military clashes with seldom publicized details well into the 1960s on the China coastal islands with an unknown number of [[Project National Glory|night raids]]. During the [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]] in September 1958, Taiwan's landscape saw [[Nike-Hercules missile]] batteries added, with the formation of the 1st Missile Battalion Chinese Army that would not be deactivated until 1997. Newer generations of missile batteries have since replaced the Nike Hercules systems throughout the island.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the ROC maintained an authoritarian, single-party government while its economy became industrialized and technology oriented. This rapid economic growth, known as the [[Taiwan Miracle]], was the result of a fiscal regime independent from mainland China and backed up, among others, by the support of US funds and demand for Taiwanese products.&lt;ref name="bbctimeline-coldwar"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/asia_pacific/2000/taiwan_elections2000/1955_1972.stm|title=Taiwan Timeline&amp;nbsp;– Cold war fortress|year=2002|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Makinen|Woodward|1989|ps=: "Yet, the Chinese Nationalist government attempted to isolate Taiwan from the mainland inflation by creating it as an independent currency area.

Because of the Cold War, most Western nations and the United Nations regarded the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China until the 1970s. Later, especially after the termination of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, most nations switched [[diplomatic recognition]] to the PRC (see [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]]).

Up until the 1970s, the government was regarded by Western critics as undemocratic for upholding [[martial law]], for severely repressing any political opposition and for controlling media. The KMT did not allow the creation of new parties and those that existed did not seriously compete with the KMT.

Although the protest was rapidly crushed by the authorities, it is today considered as the main event that united Taiwan's opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/asia_pacific/2000/taiwan_elections2000/1972_1986.stm|title=Out with the old|year=2002|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, Chiang Ching-kuo lifted martial law on the main island of Taiwan (martial law was lifted on Penghu in 1979, Matsu island in 1992 and Kinmen island in 1993). With the advent of democratization, the issue of the [[political status of Taiwan]] gradually resurfaced as a controversial issue where, previously, the discussion of anything other than unification under the ROC was [[taboo]].

After the death of Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, Lee Teng-hui succeeded him and became the first Taiwan-born president. Lee continued to democratize the government and decrease the concentration of government authority in the hands of mainland Chinese. Under Lee, Taiwan underwent a process of [[Taiwanese localization movement|localization]] in which Taiwanese culture and history were promoted over a pan-China viewpoint in contrast to earlier KMT policies which had promoted a Chinese identity. Lee's reforms included printing banknotes from the Central Bank rather than the Provincial Bank of Taiwan, and streamlining the [[Taiwan Provincial Government]] with most of its functions transferred to the [[Executive Yuan]]. Under Lee, the original members of the [[Legislative Yuan]] and [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] (a former supreme legislative body defunct in 2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The previously nominal representation in the Legislative Yuan was brought to an end, reflecting the reality that the ROC had no jurisdiction over mainland China, and vice versa.

The KMT increased its majority in the Legislative Yuan in the [[Republic of China legislative election, 2008|January 2008 legislative elections]], while its nominee [[Ma Ying-jeou]] went on to [[Republic of China presidential election, 2008|win the presidency]] in March of the same year, campaigning on a platform of increased economic growth and better ties with the PRC under a policy of "[[Special non-state-to-state relations|mutual nondenial]]".&lt;ref name="lam200803" /&gt; Ma took office on 20 May 2008, the same day that President Chen Shui-bian stepped down and was notified by prosecutors of [[Chen Shui-bian corruption charges|possible corruption charges]]. Part of the rationale for campaigning for closer economic ties with the PRC stems from the strong economic growth China attained since joining the [[World Trade Organization]]. However, some analysts say that despite the election of Ma Ying-jeou, the diplomatic and military tensions with the PRC have not been reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2009-08-20-voa17-68706212/409333.html |title=Taiwan-China Economic Ties Boom, Military Tensions Remain {{!}} English |publisher=Voice of America |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taiwan NASA Terra MODIS 23791.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Taiwan is mostly mountainous in the east, with gently sloping plains in the west. The [[Penghu Islands]] are west of the main island.]]

The total area of the [[Free area of the Republic of China|current jurisdiction of the Republic of China]] is {{convert|36193|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="taiwan-popstat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sowf.moi.gov.tw/stat/month/m1-01.xls |title=Number of Villages, Neighborhoods, Households and Resident Population |publisher=MOI Statistical Information Service |accessdate=2 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329071215/http://sowf.moi.gov.tw/stat/month/m1-01.xls |archivedate=29 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|137th-largest]] country/dependency, smaller than [[Switzerland]] and larger than [[Belgium]].

The island of Taiwan has an area of {{convert|35883|km2|0|abbr=on}}, and lies some {{convert|180|km}} from the southeastern coast of mainland China across the [[Taiwan Strait]].&lt;ref name="taiwan-popstat" /&gt; The [[East China Sea]] lies to the north, the [[Philippine Sea]] to the east, the [[Bashi Channel]] of the [[Luzon Strait]] directly to the south, and the [[South China Sea]] to the southwest.
Its shape is similar to a [[sweet potato]], giving rise to the slang term ''sweet potato'' used by [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] speakers to refer to people of native Taiwanese descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chao | first1 = Kang | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Marshall | year = 2000 | title = Nationalist Social Sciences and the Fabrication of Subimperial Subjects in Taiwan | journal = Positions | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 151–171 | doi = 10.1215/10679847-8-1-151 }} p. 167/&lt;/ref&gt;

The island is characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of rugged mountains running in five ranges from the northern to the southern tip of the island, and the flat to gently rolling [[Chianan Plain]]s in the west that are also home to most of Taiwan's population. Taiwan's highest point is [[Yushan (mountain)|Yu Shan]] (Jade Mountain) at {{convert|3952|m}},{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=43}} making Taiwan the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest island]].

The [[Penghu Islands]], {{convert|50|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} west of the main island, have an area of {{convert|126.9|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}. More distant [[List of islands of Taiwan|islands of the Republic of China]] are the [[Kinmen]], [[Wuchiu]] and [[Matsu Islands]] off the coast of [[Fujian]], with a total area of {{convert|180.5|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}, and the [[Pratas Islands]] and [[Taiping Island]] in the South China Sea, with a total area of {{convert|2.9|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} and no permanent inhabitants.&lt;ref name="taiwan-popstat" /&gt;
The ROC government also claims the [[Senkaku Islands]] to the northeast, which are controlled by Japan.

=== Climate ===
Taiwan lies on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], and its general [[climate]] is marine [[tropical climate|tropical]].&lt;ref name="cia-factbook"&gt;{{cite web |title=Taiwan|work=CIA World Factbook|location=Langley, Virginia|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tw.html|access-date=10 November 2018|date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical and the mountainous regions are temperate.{{sfnp|Exec.

=== Geology ===
{{Main|Geology of Taiwan}}
[[File:DabajianMountain.jpg|thumb|[[Dabajian Mountain]]]]
The island of Taiwan lies in a complex [[tectonics|tectonic]] area between the [[Yangtze Plate]] to the west and north, the [[Okinawa Plate]] on the north-east, and the [[Philippine Mobile Belt]] on the east and south. The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of [[terrane]]s, mostly old [[island arc]]s which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was [[subduction|subducted]] beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/~anderson/taiwan/tai_index.html |title=Geology of Taiwan |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The east and south of Taiwan are a complex system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between the North Luzon Trough portion of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]] and South China, where accreted portions of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc|Luzon Arc]] and Luzon forearc form the [[Haian Range|eastern Coastal Range]] and parallel inland [[Huatung Valley|Longitudinal Valley]] of Taiwan respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Clift, Schouten and Draut (2003) in ''Intra-Oceanic Subduction Systems: Tectonic and Magmatic Processes'', {{ISBN|1-86239-147-5}} p84–86&lt;/ref&gt;

The major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various [[terrane]]s. These have produced major quakes throughout the history of the island. On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the "[[1999 Jiji (Chichi) earthquake|921 earthquake]]" killed more than 2,400 people. The [[seismic hazard map]] for Taiwan by the USGS shows 9/10 of the island as the highest rating (most hazardous).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/GSHAP/eastasia/asiafin.gif |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000303055258/http://seismo.ethz.ch/gshap/eastasia/asiafin.gif |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 March 2000 |title=USGS seismic hazard map of Eastern Asia |publisher=Seismo.ethz.ch |accessdate=30 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political and legal statuses of Taiwan are contentious issues. The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) claims that the Republic of China government is illegitimate, referring to it as the "Taiwan Authority".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2005 |title=The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue |work=PRC Taiwan Affairs Office and the Information Office of the State Council |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213045631/http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=WhitePaper&amp;title=White%20Papers%20On%20Taiwan%20Issue&amp;m_id=4|url=http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=WhitePaper&amp;title=White%20Papers%20On%20Taiwan%20Issue&amp;m_id=4|archivedate=13 February 2006 |accessdate=3 December 2014}} Section 1: "Since the KMT ruling clique retreated to Taiwan, although its regime has continued to use the designations "Republic of China" and "government of the Republic of China," it has long since completely forfeited its right to exercise state sovereignty on behalf of mainland China and, in reality, has always remained only a separate state on the island of Taiwan."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, "Taiwan Flashpoint", "But Taiwan's leaders say it is clearly much more than a province, arguing that it is a sovereign state. It has its own constitution, democratically elected leaders, and 400,000 troops in its armed forces."&lt;/ref&gt; The ROC has its own constitution, independently elected president and armed forces. It has not formally renounced its claim to the mainland, but ROC government publications have increasingly downplayed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chang |first=Bi-yu |date=2015 |title=Place, Identity, and National Imagination in Post-war Taiwan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hgaUBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=9781317658122&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q=9781317658122&amp;f=false |location=Oxon, UK, and New York, USA |publisher=Routledge |pages=35–40, 46–60 |isbn=978-1-317-65812-2 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally, there is controversy on whether the ROC still exists as a state or a defunct state per [[international law]] due to the lack of wide [[diplomatic recognition]]. In a poll of Taiwanese aged 20 and older taken by [[TVBS]] in March 2009, a majority of 64% opted for the "status quo", while 19% favoured "independence" and 5% favoured "unification".&lt;ref name="tid-tvbs-survey" /&gt;

The political environment is complicated by the potential for military conflict should Taiwan declare de jure independence; it is the official PRC policy to use force to ensure unification if peaceful unification is no longer possible, as stated in its [[anti-secession law]], and for this reason there are substantial military installations on the [[Fujian]] coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/china/facility/liancheng.htm|title=Liancheng / Lianfeng Airbase&amp;nbsp;– Chinese Military Forces|publisher=Federation of American Scientists|accessdate=7 June 2009|quote=In March 2000 it was reported that the PLA Air Force was deploying new air-defense missiles [possibly batteries of Russian-made S-300 missiles] opposite Taiwan at the coastal cities of Xiamen and Shantou, and at Longtian, near Fuzhou.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2004NatDefRpt&gt;{{cite web|year=2004 |title=2004 National Defense Report |format=PDF |work=ROC Ministry of National Defense |url=http://report.mnd.gov.tw/eng/pdf/all-1-360.pdf |accessdate=5 March 2006|pages=89–90|quote=The PRC refusal to renounce using military power against Taiwan, its current emphasis on 'enhancing preparation for military struggle', its obvious intention of preparing a war against Taiwan reflected in operational deployment, readiness efforts, and annual military exercises in the Southeast China coastal region, and its progress in aerospace operations, information warfare, paralyzing warfare, and non-conventional warfare, all of these factors work together so that the ROC Armed Forces face an increasingly complicated and difficult situation in terms of self-defense and counterattack.

The PRC supports a version of the [[One-China policy]], which states that Taiwan and mainland China are both part of China, and that the PRC is the only legitimate government of China. It uses this policy to prevent the international recognition of the ROC as an independent sovereign state, meaning that Taiwan participates in international forums under the name "[[Chinese Taipei]]". With the emergence of the Taiwanese independence movement, the name "Taiwan" has been employed increasingly often on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/world/asia/12taiwan.html|title=Taiwan's Independence Movement Likely to Wane|last=Wong|first=Edward |date=12 March 2008|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taiwanese Embassy in Mbabane.JPG|thumb|[[Embassy of the Republic of China (Taiwan) in the Kingdom of Swaziland|ROC embassy]] in [[Swaziland]].]]

Before 1928, the [[foreign policy]] of Republican China was complicated by a lack of internal unity—competing centres of power all claimed legitimacy. This situation changed after the defeat of the [[Beiyang Government|Peiyang Government]] by the Kuomintang, which led to widespread diplomatic recognition of the Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/countries/china |title=Countries&amp;nbsp;– China|publisher=US Department of State, Office of the Historian|accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the KMT's retreat to Taiwan, most countries, notably the countries in the [[Western Bloc]], continued to maintain relations with the ROC. Due to diplomatic pressure, recognition gradually eroded and many countries switched recognition to the PRC in the 1970s. [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|UN Resolution 2758]] (25 October 1971) recognized the [[People's Republic of China]] as China's sole representative in the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Eyal Propper. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120325191248/http://israelcfr.com/documents/issue5_china.pdf "How China Views its National Security,"] [[Israel Council on Foreign Relations|The Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs]], May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PRC refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation that recognizes the ROC, and requires all nations with which it has diplomatic relations to make a statement recognizing its claims to Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Henckaerts|first=Jean-Marie|title=The international status of Taiwan in the new world order|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=1996|pages=96–97|isbn=978-90-411-0929-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_9kuVIayxDoC&amp;pg=PA96}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, only {{Numrec|ROC||UN member states}} and the [[Holy See]] maintain official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China. The ROC maintains unofficial relations with most countries via ''[[de facto]]'' [[embassy|embassies]] and [[consul (representative)|consulates]] called [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office]]s (TECRO), with branch offices called "Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices" (TECO). Both TECRO and TECO are "unofficial commercial entities" of the ROC in charge of maintaining [[diplomacy|diplomatic relations]], providing consular services (i.e. visa applications), and serving the national interests of the ROC in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Vang|first=Pobzeb |title=Five Principles of Chinese Foreign Policies|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4343-6971-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TvXlFsxmJiMC|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] remains one of the [[Republic of China-United States relations|main allies]] of the country and, through the [[Taiwan Relations Act]] passed in 1979, has continued selling arms and providing military training to the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="TRA-review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/asiaandthepacific/bg1272.cfm|title=The Taiwan Relations Act After 20 Years: Keys to Past and Future Success|first=Stephen J.|last=Yates|author-link=Stephen J.

In January 2010, the Obama administration announced its intention to sell $6.4 billion worth of military hardware to Taiwan. As a consequence, the PRC threatened the US with economic sanctions and warned that their co-operation on international and regional issues could suffer.&lt;ref name="SanctionsAFP"&gt;{{cite news|title=China: US spat over Taiwan could hit co-operation |date=2 February 2010 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jDzKLVZ7X2dz8yrsshklcJZh38Cg |work=[[Google News]] |publisher=[[Google]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206214100/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jDzKLVZ7X2dz8yrsshklcJZh38Cg |archivedate=6 February 2010 |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official position of the United States is that the PRC is expected to "use no force or threat[en] to use force against Taiwan" and the ROC is to "exercise prudence in managing all aspects of [[Cross-Strait relations]]." Both are to refrain from performing actions or espousing statements "that would unilaterally alter Taiwan's status."&lt;ref name="UsPolicyToTaiwan"&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |date=21 April 2004|title=Overview of US Policy Towards Taiwan |url=https://www.state.gov/p/eap/rls/rm/2004/31649.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410165253/http://www.state.gov/p/eap/rls/rm/2004/31649.htm |archivedate=10 April 2008 |accessdate=17 July 2014 |last=Kelly |first=James A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Participation in international events and organizations ===
{{See also|Foreign relations of Taiwan#Relation with International organizations}}

The ROC was a founding member of the United Nations, and held the [[China and the United Nations|seat of China]] on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] and other UN bodies until 1971, when it was expelled by Resolution 2758 and replaced in all UN organs with the PRC. Each year since 1992, the ROC has petitioned the UN for entry, but its applications have not made it past committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwandc.org/un-2001.htm |title=Taiwan and the United Nations |publisher=New Taiwan |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its centre stands a circular symbol depicting a white sun on a blue background. The five Olympic circles (blue, yellow, black, green and red) stand below it.]]
Due to its limited international recognition, the Republic of China is a member of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]], represented by a government-funded organization, the [[Taiwan Foundation for Democracy]] (TFD) under the name "Taiwan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unpo.org/content/view/7908/146/ |title=Taiwan |publisher=UNPO |accessdate=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfd.org.tw/english/about.php|title=About TFD|publisher=TFD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also due to its One China policy, the PRC only participates in international organizations where the ROC is not recognized as a sovereign country. Most [[Member states of the United Nations|member states]], including the United States, do not wish to discuss the issue of the ROC's political status for fear of souring diplomatic ties with the PRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Tkacik |first=John |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2009/05/13/2003443455 |title=JOHN TKACIK ON TAIWAN: Taiwan's 'undetermined' status|newspaper=Taipei Times |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both the US and [[Japan]] publicly support the ROC's bid for membership in the [[World Health Organization]] as an observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Su |first=Joy |title=WHO application: a question of health or politics? |date=19 May 2004 |newspaper=Taipei Times |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/05/19/2003156094}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, though the ROC sought to participate in the WHO since 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minister Chiu leads our WHA delegation to actively hold bilateral talks with delegations from other nations.

Due to PRC pressure, the ROC is forced to use the name "[[Chinese Taipei]]" in international events, such as the [[Olympic Games]], where the PRC is also a party.&lt;ref name="chinese-taipei"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan%20relations/2008/07/25/167036/Taiwan-insists.htm |title=Taiwan insists on 'Chinese Taipei' |newspaper=China Post |date=25 July 2008 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROC is typically barred from using its national anthem and national flag in international events due to PRC pressure; ROC spectators attending events such as the Olympics are often barred from bringing [[Flag of the Republic of China|ROC flags]] into venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Taiwan flags in Salt Lake ruffle a few feelings |date=10 February 2002 |newspaper=The Deseret News |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/894748/Taiwan-flags-in-SL-ruffle-a-few-feelings.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Taiwan also participates in the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum (since 1991) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (since 2002) under the name "Chinese Taipei".
The ROC is able to participate as "China" in organizations that the PRC does not participate in, such as the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]].

=== Opinions within Taiwan ===
{{See also|Taiwan independence|Chinese Unification}}
Within Taiwan, opinions are polarized between those supporting unification, represented by the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] of parties, and those supporting independence, represented by the [[Pan-Green Coalition]].

The KMT, the largest Pan-Blue party, supports the status quo for the indefinite future with a stated ultimate goal of unification. However, it does not support unification in the short term with the PRC as such a prospect would be unacceptable to most of its members and the public.&lt;ref name="ma-three-noes" /&gt; Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the KMT and former president of the ROC, has set out democracy, economic development to a level near that of Taiwan, and equitable wealth distribution as the conditions that the PRC must fulfill for reunification to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/05/16/156644/Unification-with.htm|title=Unification with China unlikely 'in our lifetimes': president-elect|last=Enav|first=Peter |date=16 May 2008|newspaper=China Post|accessdate=13 June 2009|quote='It is very difficult for us to see any unification talks even in our lifetimes,' Ma said. 'Taiwanese people would like to have economic interactions with the mainland, but obviously they don’t believe their political system is suitable for Taiwan.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic Progressive Party]], the largest Pan-Green party, officially seeks independence, but in practice also supports the status quo because its members and the public would not accept the risk of provoking the PRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Eckholm |first=Erik |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/22/world/why-a-victory-in-taiwan-wasn-t-enough-for-some.html |title=Why a Victory in Taiwan Wasn't Enough for Some|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 March 2000 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title=Taiwan Flashpoint: Independence debate |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/asia_pac/04/taiwan_flashpoint/html/independence_debate.stm |year=2009 |quote=Since neither outcome looks likely in the short or even medium term, it is perhaps not surprising that opinion polls suggest most Taiwanese people want things to stay as they are, with the island's ambiguous status unresolved.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 September 2008, Mexican newspaper ''[[El Sol de Mexico|El Sol de México]]'' asked President Ma about his views on the subject of "[[two Chinas]]" and if there was a solution for the sovereignty issues between the two. The president replied that the relations are neither between two Chinas nor two states. It is a [[Special non-state-to-state relations|special relationship]]. Further, he stated that the sovereignty issues between the two cannot be resolved at present, but he quoted the "[[1992 Consensus]]", currently accepted by both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China, as a temporary measure until a solution becomes available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/oem/notas/n836891.htm|title=Impulsa Taiwan la reconciliación|date=2 September 2008|newspaper=El Sol de México|language=Spanish|accessdate=9 June 2009|quote=Esencialmente, no definiríamos la relación a través del estrecho de Taiwan como una relación de dos países o dos Chinas, porque nuestra Constitución no lo permite. Nosotros definiríamos está relación como una relación muy especial, ya que la Constitución nuestra, igual que la Constitución de China continental, no permite la existencia de otro país dentro del territorio.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 September 2017, Taiwanese premier [[William Lai]] said that he was a "political worker who advocates Taiwan independence", but that as Taiwan was an independent country called the Republic of China, it had no need to declare independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=As of 11:59AM  |url=http://www.todayonline.com/chinaindia/china/taiwanese-premiers-independence-stance-incurs-beijings-wrath |title=Taiwanese premier’s independence stance incurs Beijing’s wrath |publisher=TODAYonline |date=28 September 2017 |accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a common position shared by both the ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan. A recent opinion poll shows that more than 90% of the people of Taiwan agree with this position.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of the Republic of China was founded on the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitution of the ROC]] and its [[Three Principles of the People]], which states that the ROC "shall be a democratic republic of the people, to be governed by the people and for the people."&lt;ref name="yb:government"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Republic of China Yearbook |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/ |chapter=Chapter 4: Government |chapterurl=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/docs/ch04.pdf |pages=55–65 |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan) |year=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512091917/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/ |archivedate=12 May 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government is divided into five branches (''Yuan''): the [[Executive Yuan]] (cabinet), the [[Legislative Yuan]] (Congress or Parliament), the [[Judicial Yuan]], the [[Control Yuan]] (audit agency), and the [[Examination Yuan]] (civil service examination agency). The constitution was drafted before the fall of mainland China to the [[Communist Party of China]]. It was created by the KMT for the purpose of all of its claimed territory, including Taiwan, even though the Communist Party boycotted the drafting of the constitution. The constitution went into effect on 25 December 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ginsburg|first=Tom|title=Judicial review in new democracies|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=111|year=2003|isbn=978-0-521-52039-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qJrsouEjOZEC&amp;pg=PA111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROC remained under martial law from 1948 until 1987 and much of the constitution was not in effect. Political reforms beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through the early 1990s liberalized the country and transformed into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]], ending KMT's continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Presidential Building, Taiwan (0747).JPG|thumb|Taiwan's popularly elected president resides in the [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei]], originally built in the Japanese era for colonial governors.]]
The [[head of state]] and commander-in-chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|armed forces]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]], who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president. The president has authority over the Yuan. The president appoints the members of the Executive Yuan as his [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], including a [[Premier of the Republic of China|premier]], who is officially the President of the Executive Yuan; members are responsible for policy and administration.&lt;ref name="yb:government" /&gt;

The main [[Legislature|legislative body]] is the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] Legislative Yuan with 113 seats. Seventy-three are elected by popular vote from single-member constituencies; thirty-four are elected based on the proportion of nationwide votes received by participating political parties in a separate party list ballot; and six are elected from two three-member aboriginal constituencies. Members serve four-year terms. Originally the unicameral [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]], as a standing [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] and [[electoral college]], held some [[parliament]]ary functions, but the National Assembly was abolished in 2005 with the power of constitutional amendments handed over to the Legislative Yuan and all eligible voters of the Republic via referendums.&lt;ref name="yb:government" /&gt;

The premier is selected by the president without the need for approval from the legislature, but the legislature can pass laws without regard for the president, as neither he nor the Premier wields veto power.&lt;ref name="yb:government" /&gt; Thus, there is little incentive for the president and the legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing parties. After the election of the pan-Green's Chen Shui-bian as President in 2000, legislation repeatedly stalled because of deadlock with the Legislative Yuan, which was controlled by a pan-Blue majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Huang |first=Jei-hsuan |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2006/09/14/2003327608 |title=Letter: KMT holds the key|newspaper=Taipei Times |date=14 September 2006 |page=8 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the ROC has been dominated by strongman single party politics. This legacy has resulted in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the president rather than the premier, even though the constitution does not explicitly state the extent of the president's executive power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jayasuriya|first=Kanishka|title=Law, capitalism and power in Asia|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|page=217|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OqGSrD9QhXcC&amp;pg=PA217|isbn=978-0-415-19743-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Judicial Yuan is the highest [[judiciary|judicial]] organ. It interprets the constitution and other laws and decrees, judges administrative suits, and disciplines public functionaries. The president and vice-president of the Judicial Yuan and additional thirteen justices form the Council of Grand Justices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China (2005) |at=Article 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are nominated and appointed by the president, with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The highest court, the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China|Supreme Court]], consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions, each of which is formed by a presiding judge and four associate judges, all appointed for life. In 1993, a separate [[List of constitutional courts|constitutional court]] was established to resolve constitutional disputes, regulate the activities of political parties and accelerate the democratization process. There is no [[jury trial|trial by jury]] but the right to a fair public trial is protected by law and respected in practice; many cases are presided over by multiple judges.&lt;ref name="yb:government" /&gt;

[[Capital punishment]] is still used in Taiwan, although efforts have been made by the government to reduce the number of executions. Nevertheless, according to a survey in 2006, about 80% of Taiwanese still wanted to keep the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/01/02/2003287050|title=Nation keeps death penalty, but reduces executions|last=Chang|first=Rich |date=2 January 2006|newspaper=Taipei Times|accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Control Yuan is a watchdog agency that monitors (controls) the actions of the executive. It can be considered a standing [[Government agency|commission]] for administrative inquiry and can be compared to the [[Court of Auditors]] of the [[European Union]] or the [[Government Accountability Office]] of the United States.&lt;ref name="yb:government" /&gt;

The Examination Yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of [[civil servant]]s. It is based on the old [[imperial examination]] system used in dynastic China. It can be compared to the [[European Personnel Selection Office]] of the European Union or the [[Office of Personnel Management]] of the United States.&lt;ref name="yb:government" /&gt;

The tension between China and Taiwan colours most of the political life, and any government move towards "Taiwan independence" is met by threat of military attack from the PRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/country_profiles/1285915.stm|title=Country profile: Taiwan|date=11 September 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRC's official policy is to [[Chinese unification|reunify Taiwan and mainland China]] under the formula of "[[one country, two systems]]" and refuses to renounce the use of military force, especially should Taiwan seek a declaration of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fapa.org/chinawp/chinathreatwp223.html|title=China's Threats, Editorial|date=23 February 2000|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political scene is generally divided into two major camps in terms of views on how Taiwan should relate to China or the PRC, referred to as [[cross-Strait relations]]. It is the main political difference between two camps: the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]], composed of the pro-unification [[Kuomintang]], [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] (PFP), and [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]], who believe that the ROC is the sole legitimate government of "China" (including Taiwan) and supports eventual [[Chinese unification|Chinese reunification]]. The opposition [[Pan-Green Coalition]] is composed of the pro-independence DPP and [[Taiwan Solidarity Union|Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)]]. It regards Taiwan as an independent, sovereign state [[Four-Stage Theory of the Republic of China|synonymous with the ROC]], opposes the definition that Taiwan is part of "China", and seeks wide [[diplomatic recognition]] and an eventual declaration of formal [[Taiwan independence]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, "Taiwan Flashpoint", "Officially, the DPP still favours eventual independence for Taiwan, while the KMT favours eventual re-unification."&lt;/ref&gt; The Pan-Green camp tends to favour emphasizing the Republic of China as being a distinct country from the People's Republic of China. Thus, in September 2007, the then ruling Democratic Progressive Party approved a resolution asserting separate identity from China and called for the enactment of a new constitution for a "''normal country''". It called also for general use of "''Taiwan''" as the country's name, without abolishing its formal name, the "Republic of China".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-09-30-taiwan_N.htm |title=Taiwan party asserts separate identity from China |newspaper=USA Today |date=30 September 2007 |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the coalition, such as former [[President of the Republic of China|President]] Chen Shui-bian, argue that it is unnecessary to proclaim independence because "Taiwan is already an independent, sovereign country" and the Republic of China is the same as Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Crisis Group |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=1653&amp;l=1 |title=Taiwan Strait I: What's Left of 'One China'?|publisher=International Crisis Group |date=6 June 2003 |accessdate=29 May 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080709035143/http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=1653&amp;l=1 |archivedate = 9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a member of KMT prior to and during his presidency, [[Lee Teng-hui]] also held a similar view and was a supporter of the [[Taiwanization]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shirk |first=Susan L.|title=China: Fragile Superpower|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-530609-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pan-Blue members generally support the concept of the One-China policy, which states that there is only one China and that its only government is the ROC. They favour eventual re-unification of China.&lt;ref name="panblue-reunif-chineseid"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pares|first=Susan |title=A political and economic dictionary of East Asia|publisher=Routledge|date=24 February 2005|page=267|isbn=978-1-85743-258-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xJKePP5ATKUC|quote=The Pan-Blue coalition on the whole favours a Chinese nationalist identity and policies supporting reunification and increased economic links with the People's Republic of China.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more mainstream Pan-Blue position is to lift investment restrictions and pursue negotiations with the PRC to immediately open direct transportation links.

=== Current political issues ===
[[File:2014 太陽花學運 DSC00465 (13573978414).jpg|thumb|[[Sunflower Student Movement|Student protest]] in Taipei against a controversial [[Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement|trade agreement with China]] in March 2014]]
The dominant political issue in Taiwan is [[cross-Strait relations|its relationship with the PRC]]. For almost 60&amp;nbsp;years, there were no direct transportation links, including direct flights, between Taiwan and mainland China. This was a problem for many Taiwanese businesses that had opened factories or branches in mainland China. The former DPP administration feared that such links would lead to tighter economic and political integration with mainland China, and in the 2006 Lunar New Year Speech, President Chen Shui-bian called for managed opening of links. Direct weekend charter flights between Taiwan and mainland China began in July 2008 under the current KMT government, and the first direct daily charter flights took off in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5346905.ece|title=Direct flights between China and Taiwan mark new era of improved relations|last=Yu|first=Sophie|author2=Jane Macartney |date=16 December 2008|newspaper=The Times|accessdate=4 June 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major political issues include the passage of an arms procurement bill that the United States authorized in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Michael S.

The politicians and their parties have themselves become major political issues. Corruption among some DPP administration officials has been exposed. In early 2006, President Chen Shui-bian was linked to possible corruption. The political effect on President Chen Shui-bian was great, causing a divide in the DPP leadership and supporters alike. It eventually led to the creation of a political camp led by ex-DPP leader [[Shih Ming-teh]] which believes the president should resign. The KMT assets continue to be another major issue, as it was once the richest political party in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== National identity ===
{{Main|Taiwanese identity|Chinese nationalism}}

Roughly 84% of Taiwan's population descends from Han Chinese who migrated from Qing China between 1661 and 1895. Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratization and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for ''de jure'' Taiwan independence.&lt;ref name="power-shift"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shambaugh|first=David L.|title=Power shift|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|pages=179–183 |isbn=978-0-520-24570-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pan-green]] camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity, while the [[pan-blue]] camp supports a Chinese identity only.&lt;ref name="panblue-reunif-chineseid" /&gt; The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20081230ho.html|title=No sign of a 'peace agreement'|last=Okazaki|first=Hisahiko|date=30 December 2008|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=15 July 2009|quote=For one thing, I believe there is recognition that the awareness of Taiwanese identity is now irreversible.

The [[Republic of China Army]] takes its roots in the [[National Revolutionary Army]], which was established by [[Sun Yat-sen]] in 1925 in [[Guangdong]] with a goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang. When the [[People's Liberation Army]] won the [[Chinese Civil War]], much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.

Today, Taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as defence against the constant threat of invasion by the [[People's Liberation Army]] under the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]]. This law gives green light to the use of military force when certain Chinese Red Lines formulated in the Anti-Secession Law are crossed like endangering citizens of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name=2004NatDefRpt /&gt; From 1949 to the 1970s, the primary mission of the military was to "retake mainland China" through [[Project National Glory]]. As this mission has shifted to defence because the strength of [[People's Republic of China]] has massively increased, the ROC military has begun to shift emphasis from the traditionally dominant Army to the [[Republic of China Air Force|air force]] and [[Republic of China Navy|navy]].
[[File:IDF Pre-production.jpg|thumb|[[Republic of China Air Force]] [[AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo|Indigenous Defense Fighter]]|alt=A light fighter aircraft on the ground surrounded by two men who are maintaining it.]]

Control of the armed forces has also passed into the hands of the civilian government.&lt;ref name=towards&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fravel|first=M. Taylor|title=Towards Civilian Supremacy: Civil-Military Relations in Taiwans's Democratization|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|year=2002|volume=29|issue=1|pages=57–84|doi=10.1177/0095327X0202900104|url=http://afs.sagepub.com/content/29/1/57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB988242686540854310?mod=googlewsj |title=Committed to Taiwan |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date= 26 April 2001|accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the ROC military shares historical roots with the KMT, the older generation of high-ranking officers tends to have Pan-Blue sympathies. However, many have retired and there are many more non-mainlanders enlisting in the armed forces in the younger generations, so the political leanings of the military have moved closer to the public norm in Taiwan.{{sfn|Swaine|Mulvenon|2001|p=65|ps=: "[...]the ROC military functioned until very recently as an instrument of KMT rule [...] the bulk of the officer corps is still composed of Mainlanders, many of whom allegedly continue to support the values and outlook of more conservative KMT and New Party members. This is viewed as especially the case among the senior officers of the ROC Army. Hence, many DPP leaders insist that the first step to building a more secure Taiwan is to bring the military more fully under civilian control, to remove the dominant influence of conservative KMT elements, and to reduce what is regarded as an excessive emphasis on the maintenance of inappropriate ground force capabilities, as opposed to more appropriate air and naval capabilities."}}

The ROC began a force reduction program, Jingshi An (translated to streamlining program), to scale down its military from a level of 450,000 in 1997 to 380,000 in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2004/P101.htm |title=Taiwan Yearbook 2004 |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China |accessdate=28 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106230514/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2004/P101.htm |archivedate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009}}, the armed forces of the ROC number approximately 300,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=28601&amp;ctNode=3389|title=Women Take Command|last=Bishop|first=Mac William|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China|accessdate=5 June 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428091100/http://www.gio.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=28601&amp;ctNode=3389|archivedate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with nominal reserves totalling 3.6&amp;nbsp;million {{As of|2015|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2005/p104.html |title=Taiwan Yearbook 2005 |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China |accessdate=28 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127214132/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2005/p104.html |archivedate=27 January 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conscription remains universal for qualified males reaching age eighteen, but as a part of the reduction effort many are given the opportunity to fulfill their draft requirement through alternative service and are redirected to government agencies or defence related industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/729500.stm |title=ASIA-PACIFIC &amp;#124; Military alternative in Taiwan |publisher=BBC News |date=1 May 2000 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current plans call for a transition to a predominantly professional army over the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2009/03/21/2003439010/wiki |title=The myth: a professional military in five years|newspaper=Taipei Times |date=21 March 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/print/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_347888.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313072548/http://www.straitstimes.com/print/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_347888.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 March 2009 |title=Taiwan to end conscription |newspaper=The Straits Times |date=9 March 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conscription periods are planned to decrease from 14&amp;nbsp;months to 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=BBAB&amp;d_place=BBAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=124D9E23B9033ED0&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Taiwan to shorten conscription term to one year |publisher=Central News Agency website, Taipei|date=3 December 2008 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last months of the Bush administration, Taipei took the decision to reverse the trend of declining defence spending, at a time when most Asian countries kept on reducing their military expenditures.

According to the 1947 constitution, the territory of the ROC is according to its "existing national boundaries".&lt;ref name=constitution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=A0000001|title=Laws &amp; Regulations Database of The Republic of China|website=law.moj.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Executive Yuan]] in 2012, Mongolia was re-recognized by Republic of China as an independent country when the constitution was announced in 1946.&lt;ref name="ExecutiveYuan_Mongolia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mac.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=101988&amp;ctNode=5650&amp;mp=1 |title=有關外蒙古是否為中華民國領土問題說明新聞參考資料 |publisher=Executive Yuan, Taiwan |location=Taipei |accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ROC retreated to Taiwan in 1949, its claimed territory consisted of 35 provinces, 12 special municipalities, 1 special administrative region and 2 autonomous regions. However, since its retreat, the ROC has controlled only [[Taiwan Province]] and some islands of [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian Province]]. The ROC also controls the [[Pratas Islands]] and [[Taiping Island]] in the [[Spratly Islands]], which are part of the disputed [[South China Sea Islands]]. They were placed under [[Kaohsiung]] administration after the retreat to Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=World: Asia-Pacific Analysis: Flashpoint Spratly |date=14 February 1999 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/279170.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1949, the government has made some changes in the area under its control. [[Taipei]] became a special municipality in 1967 and [[Kaohsiung]] in 1979. The two provincial governments were "streamlined", with their functions transferred to the central government (Fujian in 1956 and Taiwan in 1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1465&amp;CtNode=1347 | work=Taiwan Review | title=Gone with the Times | date=1 October 1999 | accessdate=13 April 2012 | last=Hwang | first=Jim | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226030251/http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1465&amp;CtNode=1347 | archivedate=26 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[New Taipei]], [[Taichung]] and [[Tainan]] were upgraded to [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipalities]].

According to Article 4 of the Local Government Act, laws pertaining to special municipalities also apply to counties with a population exceeding 2 million.  This provision does not currently apply to any county, although it previously applied to Taipei County (now [[New Taipei City]]) and Taoyuan County (now [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]] City).

The quick industrialization and rapid growth of Taiwan during the latter half of the 20th century has been called the "[[Taiwan Miracle]]". Taiwan is one of the "[[Four Asian Tigers]]" alongside [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]] and [[Singapore]].

Japanese rule prior to and during World War II brought changes in the public and private sectors, most notably in the area of public works, which enabled rapid communications and facilitated transport throughout much of the island. The Japanese also improved public education and made it compulsory for all residents of Taiwan.

By 1945, [[hyperinflation]] was in progress in mainland China and Taiwan as a result of the war with Japan. To isolate Taiwan from it, the Nationalist government created a new currency area for the island, and began a price stabilization program. These efforts significantly slowed inflation.

When the KMT government fled to Taiwan it brought millions of [[tael]]s (where 1&amp;nbsp;tael = 37.5 g or ~1.2&amp;nbsp;[[troy ounce|ozt]]) of [[gold]] and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China, which, according to the KMT, stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=6 April 2011 |title=Gold Shipped to Taiwan in 1949 Helped Stabilize ROC on Taiwan|url=http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&amp;mnum=112&amp;anum=9442|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927081949/http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&amp;mnum=112&amp;anum=9442|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 September 2011|newspaper=Kuomintang News Network|accessdate=14 June 2011}} Translated from {{cite news |author=王銘義 |date=5 April 2011 |script-title=zh:1949年運台黃金 中華民國保命本 |newspaper=China Times |url=http://forums.chinatimes.com/report/goldfile/series-cnt0405ct02.htm |accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps more importantly, as part of its retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought the intellectual and business elites from Mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Roy | first =Denny | title =Taiwan: A Political History | publisher =Cornell University Press |year=2003 | location =Ithaca, NY | pages =76, 77 | isbn =978-0-8014-8805-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The KMT government instituted many laws and [[land reform]]s that it had never effectively enacted on mainland China. The government also implemented a policy of [[import substitution industrialization|import-substitution]], attempting to produce imported goods domestically.

In 1950, with the outbreak of the Korean War, the United States began an aid program which resulted in fully stabilized prices by 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Makinen|Woodward|1989}}: "It was the fiscal regime change on Taiwan, as in the European episodes, that finally brought price stability. It was the aid program that brought the budget to near balance, and when the aid program reached its full proportions in 1952, prices stabilized."&lt;/ref&gt; Economic development was encouraged by American economic aid and programs such as the [[Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]], which turned the agricultural sector into the basis for later growth. Under the combined stimulus of the land reform and the agricultural development programs, agricultural production increased at an average annual rate of 4 per cent from 1952 to 1959, which was greater than the population growth, 3.6%.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Clough, "Taiwan under Nationalist Rule, 1949–1982," in Roderick MacFarquar et al., ed., ''Cambridge History of China'', Vol 15, The People's Republic Pt 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 837&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Taiwan had a (nominal) per-capita gross national product (GNP) of $170, placing its economy on a par with those of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. On a [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) basis, its GDP per capita in the early 1960s was $1,353 (in 1990 prices). By 2011 per-capita GNP, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), had risen to $37,000, contributing to a [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) equivalent to that of other developed countries. Taiwan's HDI in 2012 is 0.890, (23rd, very high), according to the UN's new "Inequality-adjusted HDI" calculation method.

In 1974, Chiang Ching-kuo implemented the [[Ten Major Construction Projects]], the beginning foundations that helped Taiwan transform into its current export driven economy. Since the 1990s, a number of Taiwan-based technology firms have expanded their reach around the world. Well-known international technology companies headquartered in Taiwan include personal computer manufacturers [[Acer Inc.]] and [[Asus]], mobile phone maker [[HTC]], as well as electronics manufacturing giant [[Foxconn]], which makes products for Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. [[Computex Taipei]] is a major computer expo, held since 1981.

Today Taiwan has a dynamic, capitalist, export-driven economy with gradually decreasing state involvement in investment and foreign trade. In keeping with this trend, some large government-owned banks and industrial firms are being [[Privatization|privatized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1153&amp;CtNode=128|title=Privatization Set in Motion|last=Her|first=Kelly|date=12 January 2005|newspaper=Taiwan Review|accessdate=5 June 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430041754/http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1153&amp;CtNode=128|archivedate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real growth in [[gross domestic product|GDP]] has averaged about 8% during the past three decades.

The cross-strait investments now exceed US$ 100 billions. Four Taiwanese-owned firms rank among China's top 10 biggest exporters. 10% of the Taiwanese labor force now works in China."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the economy of Taiwan benefits from this situation, some have expressed the view that the island has become increasingly dependent on the Mainland Chinese economy. A 2008 white paper by the Department of Industrial Technology states that "Taiwan should seek to maintain stable relation with China while continuing to protect national security, and avoiding excessive 'Sinicization' of Taiwanese economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DoIT|2008|p=5}} "Although used-to-be-hostile tension between Taiwan and China has been eased to a certain degree, Taiwan should seek to maintain stable relation with China while continuing to protect national security, and avoiding excessive "Sinicization" of Taiwanese economy. Strategies to avoid excessive "Sinicization" of the Taiwanese economy could include efforts to increase geographic diversity of overseas Taiwanese employment, diversifying Taiwan's export markets and investment. "&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that close economic ties between Taiwan and Mainland China would make any military intervention by the PLA against Taiwan very costly, and therefore less probable.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, "Taiwan Flashpoint", "Some Taiwanese worry their economy is now dependent on China. Others point out that closer business ties makes Chinese military action less likely, because of the cost to China's own economy."&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwan's total trade in 2010 reached an all-time high of US$526.04 billion, according to Taiwan's Ministry of Finance. Both exports and imports for the year reached record levels, totalling US$274.64 billion and US$251.4 billion, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wang |first=Audrey  |url=http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=142731&amp;ctNode=453&amp;mp=9|title=Taiwan's 2010 trade hits record high|newspaper=Taiwan Today|date=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ROC has become a major foreign investor in the PRC, [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Vietnam]]. It is estimated that some 50,000&amp;nbsp;Taiwanese businesses and 1,000,000&amp;nbsp;businesspeople and their dependents are established in the PRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Morris |first=Peter |title=Taiwan business in China supports opposition |date=4 February 2004 |newspaper=Asia Times Online |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FB04Ad04.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its conservative financial approach and its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered little compared with many of its neighbours from the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. Unlike its neighbours, South Korea and Japan, the Taiwanese economy is dominated by small and medium-sized businesses, rather than the large business groups. The global economic downturn, however, combined with poor policy co-ordination by the new administration and increasing bad debts in the banking system, pushed Taiwan into [[recession]] in 2001, the first whole year of negative growth since 1947. Due to the relocation of many manufacturing and labour-intensive industries to the PRC, unemployment also reached a level not seen since the 1970s oil crisis. This became a major issue in the [[Republic of China presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]. Growth averaged more than 4% in the 2002–2006 period and the unemployment rate fell below 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5411/is_199801/ai_n21432097/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608110113/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5411/is_199801/ai_n21432097/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 June 2009 |title=Coping with Asian financial crisis: The Taiwan experience &amp;#124; Seoul Journal of Economics |publisher=Find Articles at BNET |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ROC often joins international organizations (especially ones that also include the People's Republic of China) under a politically neutral name. The ROC has been a member of governmental trade organizations such as the [[World Trade Organization]] under the name Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu ([[Chinese Taipei]]) since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/theWTO_e/countries_e/chinese_taipei_e.htm|title=Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei) and the WTO|publisher=World Trade Organization|accessdate=7 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Transportation and Communications (Republic of China)|Ministry of Transportation and Communications]] of the Republic of China is the cabinet-level governing body of the transportation network in Taiwan. Taiwan has an extensive highway network, classified into five levels: national highways, provincial highways, county routes, township routes, and special routes, with the first four being common. Taiwan also has an extensive bus network, most of which are run by private bus companies. Inter-city rail services are provided by [[Taiwan Railway Administration]] (TRA) and [[Taiwan High Speed Rail]] (THSR). Rapid transit systems include the [[Taipei Metro]], [[Taoyuan Metro]] (incl. the [[Airport MRT]]) and [[Kaohsiung MRT]], while [[Taichung Metro]] is under construction. Major airports include [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|Taiwan Taoyuan]], [[Kaohsiung International Airport|Kaohsiung]], [[Taipei Songshan Airport|Taipei Songshan]] and [[Taichung Airport|Taichung]]. There are currently seven airlines in Taiwan, the largest ones being [[China Airlines]] and [[EVA Air]]. There are four international seaports: [[Port of Keelung|Keelung]], [[Port of Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung]], [[Port of Taichung|Taichung]], and [[Port of Hualien|Hualien]].

The higher education system was established in Taiwan by Japan during the colonial period. However, after the Republic of China [[Retrocession Day|took over]] Taiwan from Japan in 1945, the system was promptly replaced by the same system as in mainland China which mixed with features of the Chinese and American educational systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Postiglione|first=Gerard A.|author2=Grace C.

Taiwan is well known for adhering to the Confucian paradigm of valuing education as a means to improve one's socioeconomic position in Taiwanese society.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/fears-over-over-education-in-taiwan/news-story/aeae2a2d83898f684fd0ac5aaffd5816 |title=Fears over over-education in Taiwan |date= 3 September 2012 |website=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy investment and a cultural value for education has catapulted the resource poor nation consistently atop the global education rankings. Taiwan is one of the top-performing countries in reading literacy, maths and sciences. In 2015, Taiwanese students achieved one of the world's best results in mathematics, science and literacy, as tested by the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/pisa-worldwide-ranking-of-math-science-reading-skills-2016-12 |title=The latest ranking of top countries in math, reading, and science is out — and the US didn't crack the top 10 |last= Kiersz |first=Andy |date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strong scholastic and educational performance of Taiwanese students has prompted the nation to build a highly educated labour force that possesses a strong background in mathematics and science to cope with the current labor market demands of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Taiwan's Democracy: Economic and Political Challenges |last=Garver |first= John  |date=2011 |publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taiwanese education system has been praised for various reasons including its comparatively high test results and its major role in ushering Taiwan's [[Taiwan Miracle|economic development]] while creating one of the world’s most highly educated workforces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isc.bc.edu/PDF/t03_download/T03_M_Chap1.pdf |title=TIMSS Math 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://isc.bc.edu/PDF/t03_download/T03_S_Chap1.pdf| title= TIMSS Science 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has also been praised for its high university entrance rate where the university acceptance rate has increased from around 20 percent before the 1970s to 49 percent in 1996 and over 90 percent since 2006, among the highest in Asia.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/education-in-taiwan-taiwans-colleges-and-universities/ |title=Education in Taiwan: Taiwan’s Colleges and Universities |last=Chou |first=Chuing |publication-date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nation's high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce making Taiwan one of the most highly educated countries in the world with 68.5% of Taiwanese high school students going on to attend university. Taiwan has a high percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree where 45 percent of Taiwanese aged 25–64 hold a bachelor's degree or higher compared with the average of 33 percent among member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; On the other hand, the system has been criticized for placing excessive pressure on students and eschewing creativity in favor of rote memorization. In addition, the system has been criticized for producing an excess supply of over-educated university graduates and a higher unemployment rate. With a large supply of university graduates seeking a limited demand of prestigious white collar jobs in an environment that is increasingly losing its competitive edge has led many degree holders ending up with lower end jobs with salaries far beneath than their expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/education/university-degrees-mindset-shift-needed |title=University degrees: Mindset shift needed |last=Lee |first=Pearl |publisher=The Straits Times |publication-date=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Taiwan’s universities have also been under criticism for not being able to fully meet the requirements and demands of Taiwan’s 21st century fast-moving job market citing a skills mismatch among a large number of self-assessed overeducated university graduates that don't fit the demands of the modern Taiwanese labor market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://monitor.icef.com/2016/08/taiwans-higher-education-enrolment-starts-downward-slide/ |title=Taiwan’s higher education enrolment starts a downward slide |date=16 August 2016 |website=ICEF Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taiwanese government has also been criticized for undermining the economy as it has been unable to produce enough jobs to meet the demands of numerous underemployed university graduates.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-24156168 |title=The draw of blue collar jobs in Taiwan |last=Sui |first=Cindy |date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Taiwanese economy is largely science and technology based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment. Although current Taiwanese law mandates only nine years of schooling, 95% of junior high graduates go on to attend a senior vocational high school, university, junior college, trade school, or other higher education institution.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Many Taiwanese students attend cram schools, or [[bushiban]], to improve skills and knowledge on problem solving against exams of subjects like mathematics, nature science, history and many others. Courses are available for most popular subjects. Lessons are organized in lectures, reviews, private tutorial sessions, and recitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investintaiwan.nat.gov.tw/en/news/200509/2005090201.html |title=Over 70% of Taiwanese parents send kids to English bushibans |publisher=Invest in Taiwan, Department of Investment Services |date=2 September 2005 |accessdate=28 May 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080608050510/http://investintaiwan.nat.gov.tw/en/news/200509/2005090201.html |archivedate = 8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=C.

Taiwan has a population of about 23.4 million,{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=36}} most of whom are on the island proper. The remainder live on [[Penghu]] (101,758), [[Kinmen]] (127,723), and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] (12,506).&lt;ref name="taiwan-popstat" /&gt;

The ROC government reports that over 95% of the population is [[Han Taiwanese|Han Chinese]], of which the majority includes descendants of early Han Chinese immigrants who arrived in Taiwan in large numbers starting in the 18th century. Alternatively, the ethnic groups of Taiwan may be roughly divided among the [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] (70%), the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] (14%), the [[Waishengren]] (14%), and indigenous peoples (2%).&lt;ref name="cia-factbook" /&gt;

The [[Hoklo people]] are the largest Han subgroup (70% of the total population), whose ancestors migrated from the coastal southern [[Fujian]] region across the [[Taiwan Strait]] starting in the 17th century. The [[Hakka people|Hakka]] comprise about 15% of the total population, and descend from Han migrants to [[Guangdong]], its surrounding areas and Taiwan. Additional people of Han origin include and descend from the 2 million Nationalists who fled to Taiwan following the communist victory on the mainland in 1949.&lt;ref name="cia-factbook" /&gt;

The indigenous [[Taiwanese aborigines]] number about 533,600 and are divided into 16 recognized groups.{{sfnp|Exec.

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Taiwan}}

[[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] is the official national language and is spoken by the vast majority of the population of Taiwan. It has been the primary language of instruction in schools since the end of Japanese rule. As in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], [[Traditional Chinese]] is used as the writing system in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="yb-languages"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Republic of China Yearbook 2011 |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan) |chapter=Chapter 2: People and Language |chapterurl=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/docs/ch02D.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514004814/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/docs/ch02D.pdf |archivedate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 70% of the population belonging to the [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] ethnic group speak [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] (a variant of the [[Min Nan]] speech of [[Fujian]] province) as their mother tongue, in addition to Mandarin, and many others have some degree of understanding. The Hakka ethnic group (15% of the population) use [[Hakka Chinese]]. Most ''[[Mainland Chinese|waishengren]]'' speak primarily Mandarin. Although Mandarin is the language of instruction in schools and dominates television and radio, non-Mandarin [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] have undergone a revival in public life in Taiwan, particularly since restrictions on their use were lifted in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="yb-languages" /&gt;

Taiwan's indigenous languages, the [[Formosan languages]], do not belong to the Chinese or Sino-Tibetan language family, but rather to the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. Their use among Taiwan's aboriginal minority groups has been in decline as usage of Mandarin has risen.&lt;ref name="yb-languages" /&gt; Of the 14 extant languages, five are considered [[moribund language|moribund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Formosan Language Archive: Linguistic Analysis and Language Processing |author1=Zeitoun, Elizabeth |author2=Yu, Ching-Hua |journal=Computational Linguistics and Chinese Language Processing |volume=10 |issue=2 |page=168 |url=http://aclclp.org.tw/clclp/v10n2/v10n2a2.pdf |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Health care]] in Taiwan is managed by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bureau of National Health Insurance |date=18 July 2006 |publisher=Taiwan BNHI |url=http://www.nhi.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current program was implemented in 1995, and is considered to be a form of social insurance. The government health insurance program maintains compulsory insurance for citizens who are employed, impoverished, unemployed, or victims of natural disasters with fees that correlate to the individual and/or family income; it also maintains protection for non-citizens working in Taiwan. A standardized method of calculation applies to all persons and can optionally be paid by an employer or by individual contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhi.gov.tw/english/webdata.asp?menu=11&amp;menu_id=295&amp;webdata_id=1865 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823191235/http://www.nhi.gov.tw/english/webdata.asp?menu=11&amp;menu_id=295&amp;webdata_id=1865 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 August 2007 |title=Bureau of National Health Insurance-National Health Insurance Act |publisher=Bureau of National Health Insurance, ROC |accessdate=28 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BNHI insurance coverage requires co-payment at the time of service for most services unless it is a preventative health service, for low-income families, veterans, children under three years old, or in the case of catastrophic diseases. Low income households maintain 100% premium coverage by the BNHI and co-pays are reduced for disabled or certain elderly people.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

According to a recently published survey, out of 3,360&amp;nbsp;patients surveyed at a randomly chosen hospital, 75.1% of the patients said they are "very satisfied" with the hospital service; 20.5% said they are "okay" with the service.

In 2004, the infant mortality rate was 5.3 with 15&amp;nbsp;physicians and 63&amp;nbsp;hospital beds per 10,000&amp;nbsp;people. The life expectancy for males was 73.5&amp;nbsp;years and 79.7&amp;nbsp;years for females according to the World Health Report.

In July 2013, the Department of Health was restructured as the [[Ministry of Health and Welfare (Republic of China)|Ministry of Health and Welfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ministry of Health and Welfare completes restructuring |date=24 July 2013 |author=Hsiao, Alison |publisher=Taipei Times |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/07/24/2003568050 |accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:taiwan.nch.ntnu.apo-hsu.2005-10a.altonthompson.jpg|thumb|[[Apo Hsu]] and the [[National Taiwan Normal University|NTNU]] Symphony Orchestra on stage in the [[National Concert Hall (Taiwan)|National Concert Hall]]]] The cultures of Taiwan are a hybrid blend of various sources, incorporating elements of traditional Chinese culture, attributable to the historical and ancestral origin of the majority of its current residents, Japanese culture, traditional Confucianist beliefs, and increasingly Western values.

After their move to Taiwan, the [[Kuomintang]] imposed an official interpretation of traditional Chinese culture over Taiwan. The government launched a [[History of the Kuomintang cultural policy|program]] promoting [[Chinese calligraphy]], [[Chinese painting|traditional Chinese painting]], [[Chinese folk art|folk art]], and [[Chinese opera]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The status of Taiwanese culture is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yip|2004|pp=230–248}}; {{harvnb|Makeham|2005|pp=2–8}}; {{harvnb|Chang|2005|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is disputed whether Taiwanese culture is a regional form of Chinese culture or a distinct culture. Reflecting the continuing controversy surrounding the [[political status of Taiwan]], politics continues to play a role in the conception and development of a Taiwanese cultural identity, especially in the prior dominant frame of a Taiwanese and [[China|Chinese]] dualism. In recent years, the concept of Taiwanese [[multiculturalism]] has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought and behaviour shared by the people of Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hsiau|2005|pp=125–129}}; {{harvnb|Winckler|1994|pp=23–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Identity politics]], along with the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China, has led to distinct traditions in many areas, including [[Taiwanese cuisine|cuisine]] and [[Music of Taiwan|music]].

One of Taiwan's greatest attractions is the [[National Palace Museum]], which houses more than 650,000 pieces of Chinese bronze, jade, calligraphy, painting, and porcelain and is considered one of the greatest collections of Chinese art and objects in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557357_9/Museum.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028163715/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557357_9/Museum.html|title=Museum|archivedate=28 October 2009|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KMT moved this collection from the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing in 1933 and part of the collection was eventually transported to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. The collection, estimated to be one-tenth of China's cultural treasures, is so extensive that only 1% is on display at any time. The PRC had said that the collection was stolen and has called for its return, but the ROC has long defended its control of the collection as a necessary act to protect the pieces from destruction, especially during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Relations regarding this treasure have warmed recently; Beijing Palace Museum Curator Zheng Xinmiao said that artefacts in both Chinese and Taiwanese museums are "China's cultural heritage jointly owned by people across the Taiwan Strait."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The classical music culture in Taiwan is highly developed and features artists such as violinist [[Cho-Liang Lin]], pianist [[Ching-Yun Hu]], and the Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society Artist Director [[Wu Han (pianist)|Wu Han]]. [[Karaoke]], drawn from contemporary Japanese culture, is extremely popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV. KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms varying on the number of guests in a group. Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to form all-encompassing elaborate evening affairs for families, friends, or businessmen. Tour buses that travel around Taiwan have several TV's, equipped not for watching movies, but primarily for singing Karaoke. The entertainment counterpart of a KTV is an MTV, being found much less frequently out of the city. There, movies out on DVD can be selected and played in a private theatre room. However, MTV, more so than KTV, has a growing reputation for being a place that young couples will go to be alone and intimate.

Taiwan has a high density of 24-hour convenience stores, which, in addition to the usual services, provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government agencies such as collection of parking fees, utility bills, traffic violation fines, and credit card payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei |authorlink=American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei |title=Convenience Stores Aim at Differentiation |journal=Taiwan Business Topics |volume=34 |issue=11 |url=http://www.amcham.com.tw/publication_topics_view.php?volume=34&amp;vol_num=11&amp;topics_id=558 |format=&amp;nbsp;– &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AConvenience+Stores+Aim+at+Differentiation&amp;as_publication=Taiwan+Business+TOPICS&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516161020/http://www.amcham.com.tw/publication_topics_view.php?volume=34&amp;vol_num=11&amp;topics_id=558 |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also provide a service for mailing packages.

Taiwanese culture has also influenced other cultures. [[Bubble tea]] and milk tea are available in Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Europe, and North America. [[List of Taiwanese television series|Taiwanese television shows]] are popular in Singapore, Malaysia, and other Asian countries. [[Cinema of Taiwan|Taiwanese films]] have won various international awards at film festivals around the world. [[Ang Lee]], a Taiwanese director, has directed critically acclaimed films such as: ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]''; ''[[Eat Drink Man Woman]]''; ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]''; ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''; ''[[Life of Pi (film)|Life of Pi]]''; and ''[[Lust, Caution]]''. Other famous Taiwanese directors include [[Tsai Ming-liang]], [[Edward Yang]], and [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]].

[[Baseball]] is Taiwan's [[national sport]] and it is a popular spectator sport. Two of the most famous Taiwanese baseball pitchers are [[Chien-Ming Wang]] and [[Wei-Yin Chen]]; both are pitchers in [[Major League Baseball]]. Other notable players playing in the United States include [[Chin-hui Tsao]] who played for the [[Colorado Rockies]] (2003–2005) and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (2007, 2015–2016), [[Hong-Chih Kuo]], [[Fu-Te Ni]], and [[Chin-lung Hu]]. The [[Chinese Professional Baseball League]] in Taiwan was established in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316075320/http://www.cpbl.com.tw/html/english/cpbl.asp|url=http://www.cpbl.com.tw/html/english/cpbl.asp|archivedate=16 March 2009 |title=Intro of CPBL |publisher=Cpbl.com.tw |accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually absorbed the competing [[Taiwan Major League]] in 2003. {{As of|2015}}, the CPBL has four teams with average attendance over 5,000 per game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbsc.org/news/pro-baseball-leagues-open-2016-seasons-worldwide-approx-150-million-fans-expected/|title=Pro Baseball Leagues open 2016 seasons worldwide – approx. 150 million fans expected|publisher=WBSC|date=17 April 2016|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides baseball, [[basketball]] is Taiwan's other major sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Audrey | last = Wang | title = A Passion for Hoops | date = 1 June 2008 | publisher = Taiwan Review | url = http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=43967&amp;CtNode=128 | work = The Taiwan Review | accessdate = 8 April 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120215062917/http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=43967&amp;CtNode=128 | archivedate = 15 February 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taekwondo has also become a mature and successful sport in recent years. In the 2004 Olympics, [[Chen Shih-hsin]] and [[Chu Mu-yen]] won the first two gold medals in women's flyweight event and men's flyweight event, respectively. Subsequent taekwondo competitors such as [[Yang Shu-chun]] have strengthened Taiwan's taekwondo culture.

Taiwan participates in international sporting organizations and events under the name of "[[Chinese Taipei]]" due to [[political status of Taiwan|its political status]]. In 2009, Taiwan hosted two international sporting events on the island. The [[World Games 2009]] were held in [[Kaohsiung]] between 16 and 26 July 2009. Taipei hosted the [[21st Summer Deaflympics]] in September of the same year. Furthermore, Taipei hosted the Summer [[Universiade]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Christie | last = Chen | title = UNIVERSIADE: Foreign athletes praise Taipei's efforts as host city | date = 30 August 2017 |work=Focus Taiwan | url = http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aftr/201708300026.aspx | accessdate = 25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwan is also a major Asian country for [[Korfball]]. In 2008, Taiwan hosted the World Youth Korfball Championship and took the silver medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Netherlands Retains World Youth Korfball Champion; Taiwan is on the Way to the World.. |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/11/08/idUS82890+08-Nov-2008+BW20081108 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203071126/https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/11/08/idUS82890%2B08-Nov-2008%2BBW20081108 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 February 2012 |accessdate=14 June 2011 |agency=Reuters Newswire |date=8 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Taiwan's korfball team won a bronze medal at the World Game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hazeldine|first=Richard|title=Jujitsu, korfball put Taiwan back on winning track|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2009/07/22/2003449286|accessdate=14 June 2011|newspaper=Taipei Times|date=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yani Tseng]] is the most famous Taiwanese [[professional golfer]] currently playing on the US-based [[LPGA Tour]]. She is the youngest player ever, male or female, to win five [[Women's major golf championships|major championships]] and was ranked number 1 in the [[Women's World Golf Rankings]]  for 109 consecutive weeks from 2011 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=At Only 22, Tseng Wins Fifth Major|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/01/sports/golf/2011-womens-british-open-yani-tseng-wins-fifth-major.html|date=1 August 2011|agency=Associated Press|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Victorious Tseng takes No. 1 ranking|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/02/14/2003495832|date=14 February 2011|agency=Agence France-Presse|work=Taipei Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/9063564/stacy-lewis-wins-lpga-founders-cup-takes-world-no-1 |title=Stacy Lewis wins, now No. 1 in world |agency=Associated Press |date=17 March 2013 |work=ESPN |accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calendar ===
{{Main|Minguo calendar}}
{{See also|Chinese calendar|Public holidays in Taiwan}}

[[File:ROC calendar.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A calendar that commemorates the first year of the Republic as well as the election of [[Sun Yat-sen]] as the provisional President|alt=A calendar with a picture of a Chinese man in the centre. On top of it stands a flag with five horizontal stripes (red, yellow, blue, white, and black).]]
Taiwan uses two official calendars: the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the [[Minguo calendar]]. The latter numbers years starting from 1911, the year of the founding of the Republic of China. For example, 2007 was the "96th year of the Republic" (民國96年),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lotta Danielsson-Murphy |url=http://www.us-taiwan.org/taiwan_holidays.html |title=Taiwan Calendar and Holidays |publisher=US-Taiwan Business Council |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while its months and days were numbered according to the Gregorian calendar.

Usually, year numbering may use the Gregorian system as well as the ROC era system. For example, 3 May 2004, may be written 2004-05-03 or 93-05-03. The use of two different calendar systems in Taiwan may be confusing, in particular for foreigners. For instance, products for export marked using the Minguo calendar can be misunderstood as having an expiration date 11&amp;nbsp;years earlier than intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2006/02/25/2003294523 |title=Taiwan may drop idiosyncratic Republican calendar|newspaper=Taipei Times |date=25 February 2006 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwan also uses the [[Chinese calendar|lunar calendar]] for traditional festivals such as the [[Chinese New Year]], the [[Lantern Festival]], and the [[Dragon Boat Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/festival_c/index_e.htm |title=Holidays and Festivals in Taiwan |publisher=Government Information Office, ROC |accessdate=28 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009021955/http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/festival_c/index_e.htm |archivedate=9 October 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
