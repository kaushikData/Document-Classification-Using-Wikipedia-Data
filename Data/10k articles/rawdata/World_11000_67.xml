The '''AN-52''' was a [[France|French]]  [[tactical nuclear weapon]] carried by [[fighter bomber]] aircraft.

The weapon was first tested on 28 August 1972, and entered service in October of that year. Between 80 and 100 bombs were manufactured for use by French tactical aircraft.

The AN-52 was 4.2 m (13&amp;nbsp;ft 9 in) long and weighed 455&amp;nbsp;kg (1,003&amp;nbsp;lb). It shared the [[MR 50 CTC]] (''charge tactique commune'' - common tactical warhead) [[warhead]] of the [[Pluton (missile)|Pluton missile]], with two yield options: a low-yield version with an explosive yield of 6 to 8 [[kiloton]]s and a higher-yield version with a 25&amp;nbsp;kt yield. It was carried by [[Dassault Mirage III|Dassault Mirage IIIE]], [[SEPECAT Jaguar|SEPECAT Jaguar A]], and [[Dassault Super Étendard]] aircraft. It was also temporarily carried by the first 30 [[Dassault Mirage 2000N]]-K1 nuclear-strike fighters, pending introduction of the standard Mirage 2000N-K2 version, which was armed with the [[Air-Sol Moyenne Portee|ASMP]] nuclear cruise missile.

It was retired in 1992 in favour of the [[Air-Sol Moyenne Portée|ASMP]] missile. A practice example of the AN 52 is preserved on its trolley in the main hanger at the [[Musée National de la Marine (Rochefort)]], France. Note the AN 52 is not identified as such and has neither labeling or signage.

'''''Aargauer Zeitung''''' (English: ''Aargauer Newspaper'') is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[German language|German-language]] [[daily newspaper]], published by [[AZ Medien Gruppe]], [[Aarau]], [[Aargau]].

==History and operations==
[[Image:Picswiss AG-26-22.jpg|thumb|''Aargauer Zeitung'''s building in [[Aarau]].]]

''Aagauer Zeitung'' was created in 1996 through the merger of the ''[[Aargauer Tagblatt (newspaper)|Aargauer Tagblatt]]'' and ''[[Badener Tagblatt (newspaper)|Badener Tagblatt]]'' newspapers.&lt;!--at august 2012, intentionally added "(newspaper)" and piped link to avoid self redirect. predecessor newspapers have a history and future-article potential--&gt;  The paper is edited in Aarau and [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]], Aargau. It produces several local editions, including under the titles ''Zofinger Tagblatt'' and ''Limmattaler Tagblatt''.&lt;!--not linked at august 2012, future-article potential seems slim--&gt;

Since January 2002, ''[[Mittelland Zeitung]]'' has been the common, core section of the newspaper as well as for newspapers ''[[Oltner Tagblatt]]'' and ''[[Solothurner Zeitung]]'' with a circulation of 200,000.{{when|date=August 2012}}

In 1997 ''Aargauer Zeitung'' had a circulation of 118,578 copies.&lt;ref&gt;

The Administrative Courts are an integral part of the [[Judicial system of Albania]], in that they deal with administrative law disputes, particularly disputes concerning the exercise of public power. Their role is to ascertain that official acts are consistent with the law and they are separate from Courts of General Jurisdiction, such as the [[District courts in Albania|District Courts]].  The Administrative Court System is a relatively new addition to the [[Judicial system of Albania|Court System of Albania]], having been established in 2012, by virtue of Law no. 49/2012 ''"On the organization and functioning of administrative courts and administrative disputes"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanders|first1=Anne|title=Report  on the Individual E valuation of Judges in  Albania|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/cepej/cooperation/Albania/Report_Evaluation_Judges_Sanders_EN.pdf|website=Council of Europe|publisher=1 EU / CoE Support to Efficiency of Justice  – SEJ|accessdate=13 August 2017|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial jurisdiction for these cases belongs to the Administrative Courts of First Instance, while the Administrative Court of Appeals is the competent court for the review of the lower court decisions.   After the Court of Appeals has rendered its decision, the aggrieved parties can seek redress to the Administrative Chamber of the [[Supreme Court of Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gjykatat Administrative (Administrative Courts)|url=http://www.zabgj.gov.al/web/Gjykatat_Administrative_178_1.php|website=Government of Albania|accessdate=13 August 2017|language=Albanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Courts ==

At present, there are six Administrative Courts of First Instance, comprising 36 [[judge]]s, while there is one Administrative Court of Appeal, made up of 7 [[judge]]s.  The respective courts are as follows:

*Administrative Court of First Instance of Durrës
*Administrative Court of First Instance of Gjirokastra
*Administrative Court of First Instance of Korce
*Administrative Court of First Instance of Shkodër
*Administrative Court of First Instance of Tirana
*Administrative Court of First Instance of Vlora
*Administrative Court of Appeal

The '''African and Malagasy Union (AMU)''' ({{lang-fr|'''Union Africaine et Malgache (UAM)'''}}) was an [[intergovernmental organization]] created to promote cooperation among newly independent states in [[Françafrique|Francophone Africa]]. The organization derives its name from the name of the [[continent]] of Africa and from the former [[Malagasy Republic]], now [[Madagascar]]. The organization went defunct in 1985.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite book

==History==
The organization was founded on 12 September 1961 in [[Antananarivo]] by members of the Brazzaville Group of French-Speaking States developing out of a meeting held in [[Brazzaville]] in December 1960. Twelve [[francophone]] countries agreed to maintain close relationships but also a special relationship with the former [[colonial power]], France. The original aims were both economic and political: to adopt common stands on international issues, to promote economic and culture cooperation, and to maintain a common defense organization. However, this caused a problem: the organization would have to depend on France. The diversity, geography, and post-colonial problems of the different countries stopped the organization from ever becoming significant.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite book

In March 1964 the UAM changed its name to the Afro-Malagasy Union for Economic Cooperation (Union Africaine et Malgache de Coopération Économique; UAMCE).&lt;ref name="HronikaBelgrade"&gt;Milutin Tomanović (1965) ''Hronika međunarodnih događaja 1964'', [[Institute of International Politics and Economics]], p224 (in [[Serbo-Croatian]])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moktar Ould Daddah]] was elected as the president of the organisation while the city of [[Yaoundé]] was selected as the headquarters seat.&lt;ref name="HronikaBelgrade"/&gt; Subsequently, it confined itself to economic affairs and by 1966 had become inactive.&lt;ref name="UAMCE"&gt;{{cite book

The African and Malagasy Common Organization (Organization Commune Africaine et Malgache; OCAM) was the successor to the UAMCE. It was set up at [[Nouakchott]] in February 1965 and comprised the original 12 members of the UAM with the addition of [[Togo]]. In May 1965 its membership was increased by the admission of the former [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian colonies]] of [[Congo (Kinshasa)]] and [[Rwanda]]. In June 1965, however, Mauritania withdrew. The remaining 14 then signed the new OCAM charter on 27 June at a meeting in [[Antananarivo]], [[Madagascar]]. The aims of the organization were economic, social, technical, and cultural cooperation. OCAM dropped the political and defense objectives that its predecessor, the UAM, had attempted to embrace. It created the structures of an international organization: a Conference of Heads of State and Government, a Council of Ministers, a Secretariat and Secretary-General, and established its headquarters at [[Bangui]] in the [[Central African Republic]]. It developed a number of joint services and of these the most successful and most well known is the multinational airline [[Air Afrique]]. In 1979 the airline was separated from OCAM.

The organization's later history became increasingly troubled. [[Mauritius]] joined in 1970. Congo (Kinshasa), by then renamed [[Zaire]], withdrew in 1972; [[Congo (Brazzaville)]] in 1973; Cameroon, Chad and Madagascar in 1974; Gabon in 1977. However, some of these countries retained their links with OCAM's various agencies. In 1982 OCAM held a summit at [[Abidjan]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]]; it had then changed its name, though only to substitute Mauritius for Madagascar, to Organization Commune Africaine et Mauricienne. OCAM, also, has ceased to operate.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The organization officially became extinct in 1985.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

'''Aghabullogue Bridge''' is a bridge in [[County Cork]], Ireland, situated {{convert|0.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-east of [[Aghabullogue]] village, and {{convert|6.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-west of [[Coachford]] village. A footstick over the Delehinagh River is depicted on the 1841 surveyed OS map, where the bridge now stands. It would appear to have been constructed by the beginning of the twentieth century, and is depicted on the 1901 surveyed OS map, but not named. The bridge is located at the meeting point of the [[townlands]] of [[Clonmoyle West]] and Dromatimore, within both the [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] and catholic [[parish]] of [[Aghabullogue]].

Many surviving bridges in mid-Cork are originally constructed of stone, arched in shape, and late eighteenth or early nineteenth century in date, and often contain semi-circular arches and pointed breakwaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=compiled by Denis Power et al.|title=Archaeological inventory of county Cork, volume 3|year=1997|publisher=Stationery Office|location=Dublin|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aghabullogue Bridge, however, would appear to be of a later construction date.

'''Arbetslinjen''' ({{IPA-sv|²arbeːtsˌlɪnjɛn|lang}}, ''the work line'') is a [[social]] [[political]] principle that emphasizes measures that primarily attempt to give the unemployed jobs instead of assistance in the form of allowance, as much as possible. This line was developed in Sweden between the years 1914 and 1920, and the term itself was used as early as the 1920s.

Arbetslinjen has been the main theme of the [[Moderate Party]] since 2005 and the core of former [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]]s policies with lower taxes for low and middle income earners, reduced allowance and increased focus on reducing exclusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1337">'''Balkan Hemus Group AD''' is an organization, part of the larger holding company [[Chimimport]], that operates the three Bulgarian airlines: [[Bulgaria Air]], [[Hemus Air]] and [[Viaggio Air]] and various other aviation activities. '''Balkan Hemus Group AD''' has a 20% stake at the ''Lufthansa Technik Sofia'', [[Lufthansa Technik]]'s fifth European base. The organization joined the three companies together under one name, Bulgaria Air.  Balkan Hemus Group has plans to acquire up to 15 new aircraft for the conjoined airline; the first deliveries took place already in 2008.
Another major project of the company is the developing of the new [[Kazan Airport]] until 2012, where Balkan Hemus Group AD will invest up to 300 million US dollars and later operate it together with [[Fraport]]. Also the company's owner Chimimport has announced it has formed a joint venture with the government of the [[Republic of Tatarstan]] to operate the semi-autonomous republic's airline [[Tatarstan Airlines]]; the delivery of the first plane already took place, the plane is former Bulgaria air [[B-737]].

In 2003 the name of the group was changed to  Bulgarian Aviation Group Plc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chimimport.bg/en/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bilen'''{{mdash}}also variously transcribed as '''Blin''', and also formerly known as the Bogo, Bogos&lt;ref name="Pease1909"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pease |first=A. E. |author-link=Alfred Edward Pease |title=The Book of the Lion |publisher=Ravenio Books |url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=XHyIDQAAQBAJ&amp;q=bogos#v=snippet&amp;q=bogos&amp;f=false |date=1909-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or North [[Agaw people|Agaw]]&lt;ref name="Minahan"/&gt;{{mdash}}are an [[ethnic group]] on the [[Horn of Africa]]. They are primarily concentrated in central [[Eritrea]], in and around the city of [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]] and further south toward [[Asmara]], the nation's capital.

==Overview==
Some of the Bilen entered Eritrea from [[Ethiopia]] during the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Niaz Murtaza, ''The Pillage of Sustainability in Eritrea, 1600s-1990s: Rural Communities and the Creeping Shadows of Hegemony'', (Greenwood Publishing Group: 1998), p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily [[agriculturalist]]s, they number about 96,000 and represent around 2.1% of Eritrea's population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2854.htm U.S. Department of State - Background Note: Eritrea]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Traditional House (8384453114).jpg|thumb|Traditional Bilen homestead]]
The Bilen practice both [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. Muslim adherents mainly inhabit rural areas and have intermingled with the adjacent [[Tigre people|Tigre]], while [[Christian]] Bilen tend to reside in urban areas and have intermingled with the Biher-Tigrinya.&lt;ref name="Minahan"&gt;James Minahan, ''Miniature empires: a historical dictionary of the newly independent states'', (Greenwood Publishing Group: 1998), pp.77-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Bilen speak the [[Bilen language]] as a mother tongue, which belongs to the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language family. Many also speak other Afro-Asiatic languages such as [[Tigre language|Tigre]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]]. In addition, younger Bilen often employ [[Arabic language|Arabic]] words and expressions in their everyday speech.&lt;ref name="Minahan"/&gt;

As of 2018, seven firms in the [[United Kingdom]] rank among the world's biggest [[book publisher|publishers]] of [[books]] in terms of revenue: [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]], [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Informa]], [[Oxford University Press]], [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]], [[The Quarto Group|Quarto]], and [[RELX Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20180917/78036-pearson-is-still-the-world-s-largest-publisher.html |title= The World's 54 Largest Publishers, 2018 |date= 14 September 2018 |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |location=US |volume=265 |number= 38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Of these, several also topped the list in 2016 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |work=Publishers Weekly |location=US |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/international/international-book-news/article/71268-the-world-s-52-largest-book-publishers-2016.html |title=World's 52 Largest Book Publishers, 2016 |date= 26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |location=US |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/international/international-book-news/article/74505-the-world-s-50-largest-publishers-2017.html |title=World's 54 Largest Publishers, 2017 |date= 25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
{{see also|Global spread of the printing press}}

In 1477 [[William Caxton]] in [[Westminster]] printed ''[[Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers|The Dictes or Sayengis of the Philosophres]],'' considered "the first [[Colophon (publishing)|dated]] book printed in England."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/printing/ |title=Printing in England from William Caxton to Christopher Barker: an Exhibition, November 1976 - April 1977 |publisher= [[University of Glasgow]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the book in the United Kingdom has been studied from a variety of cultural, economic, political, and social angles. The learned [[Bibliographical Society]] first met in 1892. In recent years influential scholars include [[Frederic Sutherland Ferguson]], [[Philip Gaskell]], [[Ronald Brunlees McKerrow]], and [[Alfred W. Pollard]].

The University of Oxford's [[Bodleian Library]] was founded in 1602.

The [[British Library]] was formally established in 1973, its collection previously part of the [[British Museum]] (est. 1753).

The [[Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003]] stipulates that the British Library receives a copy of every printed work published in the United Kingdom. Five other libraries are entitled to copies: [[Cambridge University Library]], University of Oxford's Bodleian Library, the [[National Library of Scotland]], the [[Library of Trinity College, Dublin]], and the [[National Library of Wales]]. The London-based Copyright Agency became the Edinburgh-based [[Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.legaldeposit.org.uk/about.html |accessdate=30 November 2017 |title=Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries |work=Legaldeposit.org.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Daily Sun''''' is a tabloid daily newspaper in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=245435|title=Tabloid Journalism in South Africa|website=Indiana University Press|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a circulation of over 287,000 daily sales in 2013, it is South Africa's largest daily paper, and second only to the ''[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]]'' in terms of largest circulation among all papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/news-and-analysis/sas-media-the-old-is-dying-the-new-is-struggling-t|title=SA`s media: The old is dying, the new is struggling to be born - NEWS &amp; ANALYSIS {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ''Daily Sun'' was launched on 1 July 2002 by [[Media24]], a division of the [[Naspers]] group. It was the brainchild of veteran journalist, Deon du Plessis, who remained its publisher and minority shareholder until 11 September 2011, when he died suddenly at his Johannesburg home.

The newspaper is based at Media Park in Auckland Park, Johannesburg, but is printed countrywide. It is now overseen by Publisher Jeremy Gordin, who took up the role in 2013. 

It targets readers in and around the major urban centres. These readers are predominantly black, English-literate with high-school or further education, and working-class earners – the economic core of South Africa.&lt;ref name=ad&gt;{{cite web|title=Daily Sun Advertising Site|url=http://www.dailysunads.co.za/dailysun/readership.htm|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital terrestrial television in Estonia''', was officially launched on 15 December, when the operator [[Zuum TV]] launched its pay service on two multiplexes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitag.org/DTTNews/article.php?Id=1463 |title=Estonia - Official launch of DTT services |date=15 December 2006 |accessdate=18 October 2007 |publisher=DigiTAG |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719013855/http://www.digitag.org/DTTNews/article.php?Id=1463 |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmissions are made with [[MPEG-4 AVC]] compression using the [[DVB-T]] standard.

In June 2007, Levira and ETV announced that they had agreed to launch an HDTV trial in July 2007. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.levira.ee/fl334eng.html |title=Levira and ETV agreed to start HD transmissions over DTT |date=4 June 2007 |publisher=Levira |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612022708/http://www.levira.ee/fl334eng.html |archivedate=12 June 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, a third multiplex was launched, covering almost all of the country. This multiplex was to be used by free-to-air services, while the two existing national multiplexes would only carry pay channels. Hence the public channel [[Eesti Televisioon|ETV]] was transferred to the new multiplex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/today/?p=2825 Third DTT mux for Estonia : Broadband TV News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the only free-to-air channels available were ETV and [[Kalev Sport]], but they were followed by [[Kanal 2]], [[TV6 Estonia|TV6]] and [[Kanal 11]] in March 2008.

As of 2010, the multiplexes contain the following channels: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.levira.ee/dyna/site/programm.pdf|title=LEVIRA DTT|accessdate=26 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1940">The '''International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators''' ('''IAATO''') was founded in 1991 by seven companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-11316653.html&lt;/ref&gt; The primary goal of the association is to "''advocate and promote the practice of safe and environmentally responsible private-sector travel to the Antarctic".&lt;ref name="iaato.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iaato.org/home|title=Home - IAATO|website=iaato.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the group's inception membership has grown to over 100 members. In addition there are tour groups working outside the association which may not follow its safety and environmental guidelines.

The need for an association like the IAATO is that seven countries have made territorial claims in [[Antarctica]]. However, no country recognizes the claim of any other country. In fact, in some cases, countries claim the same piece of the continent. Therefore, it is rarely clear what authority is in charge. This has left the [[Tourism in Antarctica|Antarctic tourism industry]] largely [[Self-regulatory organization|self-regulated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2007-11-27-antarctica-tourism-boom_N.htm|title=Cruise ship sinking sparks concerns over Antarctica tourism - USATODAY.com|website=www.usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the need for an organization like the IAATO.

There is a IAATO website&lt;ref name="iaato.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iaato.org/home|title=Home - IAATO|website=iaato.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has information on the Antarctic Treaty, visitor guidelines, visitor briefing videos, tourism statistics and more.

'''''MS Georg Ots''''' was a cargo/passenger ferry that sailed between [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] and [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]] from 1980 to 2000.  From 2002 it was used as a cargo/passenger ferry that sailed between [[St.Petersburg]] and [[Baltiysk]]. The ship was built for the [[Estonian Shipping Company]]. The 12,600-ton ship (length 134 meters, breadth 21 meters, draft 5,7 meters) could carry 1200 passengers, thirteen 13.6 m-long trailers or 107 passenger cars. It was named after the Estonian baritone, [[Georg Ots]].  In 2002 she was sold to the St. Petersburg Shipping Company and sailed until 2010. In 2012 the ship was rented to an unnamed company who sailed it to China and illegally sold it to be scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.err.ee/v/society/de81fe3f-791c-4948-a0c3-3ed53849be16 "Legendary Estonian Ferry Finds Sad End in Chinese Scrap Yard"], ''[[Eesti Rahvusringhääling]]''.

The '''[[Moldova]] national [[rugby league]] team''' first competed into international competition in 1993. Moldova has not competed internationally since the [[1995 Rugby League Emerging Nations Tournament|1995 Emerging Nations World Cup]]. Rugby league is no longer played in Moldova and while there were attempts to revive the national team for a tournament in 2003 (likely based on Russian players of Moldovan descent and Moldovan rugby union players) the team failed to materialise. There are no known current plans to resurrect the team, though rugby league has recently started in neighbouring Ukraine.

The Moldovan national side was largely based on the semi-professional Tiraspol side who played in the Russian Rugby League in its early seasons, where they even won some early titles, though at one stage there was also a small amateur Tiraspol league.

Spence began his radio presenting career with the pirate station [[Radio Atlanta]], which began broadcasting in May 1964 from the motor vessel [[MV Mi Amigo]] off the east coast of the UK. When Radio Atlanta was taken over by [[Radio Caroline]] in July 1964, Spence resigned and left the station. At some point that year he worked briefly as a DJ at [[Radio City (pirate radio station)|Radio City]], which broadcast from an old army fort at Shivering Sands in the Thames Estuary. A short time later he was as at [[Radio 390|Radio Invicta]], a "sweet music station" which broadcast from a second world war fort at Red Sands, near Whitstable in Kent.&lt;ref&gt;Skues (2009) Pop Went the Pirates, p.21, p.98, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 1964 a demo tape won Spence a lunchtime spot on [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]], which was due to begin broadcasting in December that year from the motor vessel [[USS Density (AM-218)|MV Galaxy]]. Along with the other launch presenters he adopted a new on-air name, Dave Dennis. Among his early colleagues were [[Earl Richmond]], [[Kenny Everett]], [[Dave Cash (disc jockey)|Dave Cash]], and senior DJ Tony Windsor, who had been with Spence at Radio Atlanta. Later arrivals included [[Tony Blackburn]].

The station was ground-breaking for UK pirate radio, in that unlike its major rival Radio Caroline it used a tight American top-40 format. "Caroline had always been what I call catch-as-catch-can radio," said Dave Cash: "You used to go out there with a bunch of records and play them. No one had any idea what order they were in. No one had any idea of format at all."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/bigl1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

After a shaky start, Spence became comfortable with the Radio London format and quickly established his lunchtime show as the most popular on the station, working live for three hours a day, often in rough seas where gramophone needles skipped across vinyl records, and with blankets to deaden the echo from the steel walls of the studio. His ratings could not be put down to formatting or music choice alone, as every DJ followed a similar tight format, based on the Dallas station KLIF. It was almost unheard of for a lunchtime radio show on any station to be a bigger draw than the breakfast show. An eventful two years saw Spence in his fast-talking persona of Dave Dennis keep his lunchtime show at the top of the station's ratings despite later competition from a wildly comedic teatime show presented by Kenny Everett and Dave Cash.

In April 1966 Spence took his holiday in New York, where he was influenced by the high-pressure presentation style of DJs such as [[Bruce Morrow]] and [[Jack Spector]], and the formatting skills of WABC's [[Rick Sklar]] and [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]]'s Ruth Meyer with her team-radio approach to presentation known as the 'Good Guys.'&lt;ref&gt;Billboard, 14 May 1966, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Billboard, Letters, 23 October 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence quit Radio London in December 1966. His parting shot was a hit single which reached number 19 in the station's own chart, featuring his sickly-sweet reading to music of a Victorian newspaper editorial,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newseum.org/exhibits/online/yes-virginia/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus|'Yes, Virginia']], reassuring a young girl that Santa Claus did indeed exist.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ndploWfH-c&lt;/ref&gt; He went to live in Southern Ireland with [[Jo Spence]], then a photographer's assistant and later a pioneering feminist photographer of the 1970s and eighties, who changed her name to his by deed poll.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Spence, 1986, Putting Myself in the Picture, p.90, p.217  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hsJTAAAAMAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio programming career==

Radio London closed down in 1967 with the introduction of the [[Marine Broadcasting Offences Act]] in 1967, and [[BBC Radio 1]] began broadcasting the same year. On his return to England, Spence began making jingles and trails for Radio 1, where many of his pirate radio contemporaries were forging on-air DJ careers. [[Kenny Everett]] in his first BBC broadcast in May 1967 jokingly named the Double-D as one of his "best friendships."&lt;ref&gt;Skues (2009) Pop Went the Pirates, p.256-57&lt;/ref&gt; Spence later said he had worked for all four BBC Radio networks, including the classical station [[BBC Radio 3]] and the speech based [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref&gt;Billboard, 30 April 1977, p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 he was appointed the first programme controller of the [[United Biscuits Network]], UBN, a station which began broadcasting by landline to two of the UK factories of United Biscuits in September that year. The aim of the station was to keep workers entertained and productive, reducing staff turnover and absenteeism while providing safety and hygiene information. A year later UB chairman [[Hector Laing, Baron Laing of Dunphail|Hector Laing]] announced the station was achieving its objectives despite many doubters, and would expand to other factories. Spence told the Financial Times with some justification that the station's quality equaled BBC Radio 1 and was "a great sound."&lt;ref&gt;'Tuning in to United Biscuits.' Financial Times [London] 7 Oct. 1971: 22. The Financial Times Historical Archive, 1888-2010. Accessed 27 Oct 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Spence developed a station which provided a top-40 format during the day, a middle-of-the-road MOR format in the evening, and a soul, blues and reggae format at night.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard, Letters, 23 October 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence also gained a reputation for talent spotting, and for developing the careers of DJs, who frequently moved on to regular broadcast stations. Among those whose early careers he helped to forge were [[Graham Dene]], who he discovered in the BBC Gramophone Library, [[Adrian Love]], and [[Roger Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/jocks/dd/daveobit.html&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Independent Local Radio]] (ILR) began to expand, many UBN presenters left to work at the new stations. In 1977 Spence himself moved to ILR, taking over as programme controller at [[Radio Trent]] from former UBN presenter Bob Snyder.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard, 30 April 1977, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; At Trent, Spence developed formats to appeal to a broad local audience, and continued to find and develop new talent. Among his hires there was [[Dale Winton]], another DJ who had been at UBN.&lt;ref&gt;Dale Winton, 2012, My Story, p.146-47  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6n7XkAZC7-sC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio training career==

Spence's first training job was in the late 1960s at the "London Broadcasting School" run by his ex-colleague [[Earl Richmond]]. Among his first trainees was [[James Whale]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/jocks/dd/daveobit.html&lt;/ref&gt; Spence developed a strong commitment to training and development during his years at UBN and Radio Trent, and that, together with his ability to talent spot, led [[Michael Bukht]], then programme controller at [[Capital Radio]], to ask him in 1980 to join the newly established [[National Broadcasting School]] as head of programmking.

From 1980 to 1985, Spence led intensive three-month courses to train music radio presenters. The school's aim was to develop talent for ILR, but many also went on to work for the BBC and in television as well as overseas, including in pirate radio. Alumni from his presentation courses included BBC presenter [[Jeremy Vine]] John Leech and the musician [[Mikey Dread]]. When the school closed in 1985, it appears Spence refused offers of work and was believed to have returned to farming. He resisted all invitations from former colleagues to attend reunions, particularly those from his pirate radio days. He died in Lincolnshire in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/jocks/dd/daveobit.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presentation style==

When the founders of Radio Atlanta had discussed where to find suitable voices for a commercial station broadcasting to the UK, they concluded that no British broadcasters were capable of the task as they were so firmly rooted in the BBC style.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/odds48.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However, they took Spence on, together with a number of DJs well-versed in commercial broadcasting in Australia. Surviving recordings give a flavour of Spence's conventional and actorly British delivery. Although formal by comparison to US and Australian commercial stations, his style was far more relaxed than the BBC of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Spence, Radio Atlanta, 1964  http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/audio/nspence.mp3&lt;/ref&gt;

Moving to Radio Invicta, Spence maintained his actor-DJ style. However, by the time he arrived at Radio London in late 1966 his performance was still considered "stuffy" by senior DJ Tony Windsor and programme director Ben Toney.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Dennis, Radio London, 9 January 1965  http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/audio/bigl03.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; Windsor was tasked with turning Neil Spence the announcer and presenter into Dave Dennis the DJ, and was asked by Toney to "break in" Spence and "give him a few tips on how to present a proper deejay show." Spence, who had grown up with little else to listen to except the BBC, responded poorly to Windsor's direction. "In the end I could tell he was about to drive Dave around the bend," said Toney, who then asked Spence to use his acting training and in effect to create "Dave Dennis, the Double-D" as a character to be played on air.

Toney was using off-air tapes of the Dallas top-40 station KLIF as a formatting aid for Radio London, and instructed Spence to listen to them carefully. "I then told him that if he were any kind of actor, he would be able to create the style of programming recorded on the tapes. As it turned out, Dave went from being a stuffy announcer to a top-notch deejay in a matter of weeks," said Toney.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Toney, 2011, The Amazing Radio London Adventure  http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/rl/bentoney/bookp3.html&lt;/ref&gt; Toney later said that of all the DJs he encouraged towards the new style of British commercial broadcasting, Spence "made the greatest amount of progress of them all." As new voices came on board, Spence the actor-DJ resolutely maintained the Dave Dennis character, catchphrases and all, in the face of a rising tide of ever more elaborate jokes aimed against him.

His cabin mate Kenny Everett began the trend by making on-air references to his smelly feet and terrible temper.&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, David &amp; Caroline Stafford (2013) Cupid Stunts  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4Tn_AgAAQBAJ&lt;/ref&gt; As the comedy became more sophisticated, Spence found himself on air with Everett having been invited to recite the weirdly obscure lyrics of the song 'Along Comes Mary' by The Association in his best actorly voice. After the words of the final chorus, "When we met I was sure out to lunch, Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch," Everett announced: "That was 'Along Comes Mary,' ladies and gentlemen, as Dave Dennis crawls out of the studio on his knees." Everett told his audience that Spence deserved an OBE for his performance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/jocks/dd/daveobit.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Recordings of Spence's lunchtime programme as Dave Dennis&lt;ref&gt;Dave Dennis, Radio London, 14 March 1965  http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/audio/dennis1.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; show his own humour breaking through his former style, as he combines a rich British-accented voice with an irreverent approach which slyly and then more confidently sends up the BBC announcers of the day, with the speed of his delivery matching the rhythm of the music he plays and his theme tune 'Go Mean' by Ruffle.

In April 1966 Spence spent his holiday from Radio London in New York, where his reputation gave him access top radio DJs and programmers.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard, 14 May 1966, p.4, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; On his return, his presentation style was even faster than before, as if to eliminate any possibility of dead air, and his microphone technique was adapted to cut through mush by making maximum use of the station's transmitter power.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Dennis, Radio London, June 1966  https://audioboom.com/boos/1099627-dave-dennis-neil-spence-radio-london-june-66&lt;/ref&gt; "DD's on-air style became machinegun-like with the volume at+3dB," said fellow London Radio DJ [[Duncan Johnson]]. "I made a comment and he said the top man in New York says you have to push the compressor to hold the listener. I didn't bother to ask why."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/dennis.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence's later on-air style remained contemporary and continued to hold the large audience he had built. "Dave Dennis swings," said one of his jingles made by [[Kenny Everett]]. But photographs began to show his newer colleagues taking on the fashions of the Swinging Sixties, while Dave Dennis remained in the swing of an earlier era. After his departure from the station, Spence's Christmas single recorded under his own name made full use of his actor-DJ talents and his acerbic humour - any eight-year-old listening would genuinely believe there was a Santa Claus, while anyone older would hoot with laughter at the cloying sentimentality.

==Training and mentoring style==

The veteran radio presenter John Peters has described his own broadcasting style as bright, tight, brief and real.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.community-net.co.uk/members/aircheck/johnpeterstracker.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Peters was trained and mentored by Spence at UBN, and these were precisely the qualities Spence emphasised to trainees from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s. Spence's own presentation style when he left Radio London at the end of 1966 was far removed from the style he encouraged in later years as a radio executive and trainer. But despite his abandonment of what he later called the "disc jokey" style, his approach was entirely consistent in having respect for the audience. If the audience had moved on, then so should the presenters.

As a trainer and mentor, Spence became a ferocious critic of the on-air performances of radio DJs. [[Dale Winton]] described him as "a very hard taskmaster who took no prisoners and could be terrifyingly blunt and honest if he didn't like your performance." On listening to Winton's second show at Radio Trent, Spence "true to form, pulled my performance to pieces with all the skill of a friendly surgeon without the use of anaesthetic."&lt;ref&gt;Dale Winton, 2012, My Story, p.146-47  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6n7XkAZC7-sC&lt;/ref&gt; Spence liked Winton enough to give him a regular afternoon show. If he didn't like a DJ, the words he used might be much the same, but the surgeon's delivery would be icily dismissive.

However, most DJs with the talent on which to build a career came to respect and admire Spence, who despite an abrasive personality at times, could warm towards those in whom he saw significant potential.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/jocks/dd/daveobit.html&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly he was keen to ensure that every presenter he trained and mentored produced their best possible performances on air. Given the qualities and immediacy of the medium, it was crucial for DJs to have the ability to recover from a mistake or a setback and continue to broadcast effectively and entertainingly, and Spence's withering critiques could be seen as essential to build on-air resilience.

At UBN in the early 1970s he ran in effect a different radio station for each factory shift. A morning top-40 format gave way to an evening middle-of-the-road feel, and then a soul, blues and reggae station at night. "The whole station is run on tight commercial lines," he told trade magazine Billboard, but added: "Unlike US Top 40 we allow much scope for a DJ's personality - and for factories in England this is just what is needed and indeed, required. This does not necessarily mean more rap [i.e. chat] - just better rap."&lt;ref&gt;Billboard, Letters, 23 October 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

At the National Broadcasting School, Spence distilled the lessons of his pirate days as well as his experience of UBN and Radio Trent. He brought on presenters suitable for ILR stations, which although they carried advertising, had a strong public service requirement as well as a commercial need to appeal to as many people in their local area as possible. At Radio London, Spence had been scrupulous in meeting and talking to his listeners, and listening to them in return, and he now instilled this approach into a new generation.

He was disparaging about presenters from his pirate days who went into ILR without changing their style to reflect a different audience and different times, telling one trainee in the early 1980s that if she listened to his old Radio London colleague Dave Cash, at that time a presenter at ILR's [[Heart Bristol|Radio West]], she would never find an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Cash, 2012, He Sounds Much Taller - Part 1, Chapter 2  https://play.spotify.com/album/2vIDbwlKVDW4xx5W4p5SDh&lt;/ref&gt; Any trainee who mentioned Spence's own pirate radio past was given a cold stare and a cold shoulder. He told a former Radio London colleague who invited him to a reunion that he refused to get involved in "this dated, rebarbative and otiose subject."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/dennis.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The actor-DJ who had thrived on a comedic onslaught by Dave Cash and Kenny Everett was careful to tell trainees that the only result if they did this to their own colleagues would be to make the butt of their jokes more popular, and their own ratings slide.

Spence took a high standard of technical competence as a basic requirement to present a tightly formatted show, and a bright personality was an absolute essential. But above all he insisted that presenters should be their authentic selves, despite his own success as a DJ having come from adopting an on-air persona. However, the personable Dave Dennis was still a recognisable part of Spence's often spikey off-air personality. His ferocious assessments of trainees' performance seemed designed to strip away any artifice or pretension, and force presenters to be genuine and real. Authenticity also meant they should use their own accent. Presenters who acquired a mid-Atlantic twang should be taken to the mid-Atlantic and left there. And he insisted DJs should be brief and to the point: "Just remember they want to hear the record. It's the people who made the record who have the real talent, not you."

Spence's critiques were always delivered while wearing his trademark dark suit and polished shoes, with every inch of his angular six foot two frame reinforcing that he was in charge. Spence played the part of programme controller with aplomb. He used the quintessential English upper-middle class accent that many successful actors adopted. His vocabulary was extensive to the point of baroque. His volume would rise and the speed increase as a trainee tried to get a word in edgeways, but in keeping with his ingrained  professionalism, there was never a swearword, just in case somewhere a microphone was open.

==Influence and legacy==

During Spence's 1966 trip to New York, the editors of the trade magazine Billboard were interested not only in his ability to build and hold a large radio audience, but in his views on the regulatory environment and the likelihood of commercial radio being introduced in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard, 14 May 1966, p4, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Spence was demonstrable proof to the US industry that British audiences wanted more than the BBC was prepared to offer, and that US top-40 format commercial radio could be adapted to attract large advertising spends while still being authentically British.

He was not the only DJ broadcasting to the UK to develop the American top-40 format for a British audience, but he was the first to master it, and he took it further and faster than his contemporaries, making early pirate radio colleagues like Earl Richmond and Tony Windsor look stuffy in their turn. In doing so, he helped prove to the British government that British audiences had a thirst for something other than the staid BBC approach. In the event, in 1967 the British government introduced the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act, and the BBC established its national pop music station Radio 1. Once commercial radio had been ruled out by the British government, interest in Spence in the US was nil.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard, 2 October 1971, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence's legacy as what Dale Winton called "one of the best ever DJs on pirate radio"&lt;ref&gt;Dale Winton, 2012, My Story, p.146-47  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6n7XkAZC7-sC&lt;/ref&gt; could easily have been a host of imitators in the same Dave Dennis Double-D mould. David Lloyd, a former member of the Radio Authority, acknowledges Spence's impact saying: "His was a powerful voice and influence on the station from launch."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davidlloydradio.com/#!insight/ckzl&lt;/ref&gt; But perhaps Spence's greatest achievement was to know when the pirate days had become tired and old, well before parodies like [[Smashie and Nicey]] started to bite those pirate DJs who became part of the BBC Radio establishment.

At UBN he turned what would have otherwise been a minor industrial radio station into an unlikely but significant source of major talent for ILR.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Stoller, Sounds of Your Life, 2010 p.120   https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OblPAQAAIAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his work at Radio Trent and the National Broadcasting School, he produced not one but several generations of presenters who knew how to respect an audience in the best possible way - by keeping as many of them as possible entertained. His contribution to making independent radio a viable alternative to the monolithic BBC radio of the day was significant. As Dale Winton put it, he was already "an influential guy" before he even began to play a pivotal role at the National Broadcasting School.

Spence's former Radio London colleague Dave Cash, acknowledging that Spence as Dave Dennis had been a superb DJ, added: "His true vocation was teaching."&lt;ref&gt;Dave Cash, 2012, He Sounds Much Taller - Part 1, Chapter 2  https://play.spotify.com/album/2vIDbwlKVDW4xx5W4p5SDh&lt;/ref&gt; In a profession tending naturally towards self-obsession, while Radio 1's ex-pirate DJs matured into their comfortable berths, Spence was developing not his own presentation style but that of others - together with a finely tuned  ear for how a station should sound, what made it distinctive from its competitors, and most importantly how it could stay in touch with its audience.

'''Operation Echo''' was the codename given by the [[Canadian Forces]] for its air activities during the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999. In support of the NATO [[Operation Allied Force]] Canadian aircraft based at [[Aviano Air Base]] in northeastern Italy [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|flew bombing missions]] over the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/od-bdo/di-ri-eng.asp?IntlOpId=96&amp;CdnOpId=110 |title=Details/Information for Canadian Forces (CF) Operation Kinetic |work=CMP Directorate of History and Heritage|year=2013 |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the campaign the Canadian air contingent consisted of 18 [[McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet|CF-18 Hornet]] aircraft from [[441 Tactical Fighter Squadron|441]] and [[425 Tactical Fighter Squadron]]s, with 69 aircrew and 250 ground crew. Between March 24 and June 10, 1999, they flew 684 [[sortie]]s in 224 missions, and dropped nearly {{Convert|500,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gravity and precision-guided bombs. Despite the fact that they comprised less than 2% of the nearly 1,000 Allied aircraft engaged in the conflict, they flew on 10% of all bombing missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cdfai.org/bergenarticles/New%20historic%20Battle%20Honour%20for%20Canadian%20jet%20fighter%20squadrons%20bittersweet.pdf |title=New historic Battle Honour for Canadian jet fighter squadrons bittersweet |first=Bob |last=Bergen |work=Canadian Defence &amp; Foreign Affairs Institute |year=2013 |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gambling table - Zensar (3630410644).jpg|thumb|The gamble of outsourcing - as demonstrated at an outsourcing summit in London in 2009]]
'''''Outsourcing''''' is "an agreement in which one company hires another company to be responsible for an existing internal activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Ian|last2=Anagnostou|first2=Angela|title=The impact of outsourcing on the transaction costs and boundaries of manufacturing|journal=International Journal of Production Economics|volume=88|issue=1|pages=61–71|doi=10.1016/s0925-5273(03)00183-x|year=2004|citeseerx=10.1.1.468.9139}}&lt;/ref&gt; It often involves the [[contract]]ing of a [[business process]] (e.g., payroll processing, claims processing), operational, and/or non-core functions, such as manufacturing, [[facility management]], [[call center]] support). The term "outsourcing" came from "outside resourcing" and dates back to at least 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | outsourcing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | outsource}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outsourcing sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one [[firm]] to another. Outsourcing is also the practice of [[Privatization|handing over control of public services to private enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, Dave, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/01/afscme-public-interest-privatization_n_3530817.html "Public Interest Group Challenges Privatization Of Local, State Government Services"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211181510/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/01/afscme-public-interest-privatization_n_3530817.html |date=2013-12-11 }}, The Huffington Post, July 1, 2013. Retrieved 2013-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting,&lt;ref name="Hira, Ron 2008"&gt;Hira, Ron, and Anil Hira. Outsourcing America: What's behind Our National Crisis and How We Can Reclaim American Jobs. New York: AMACOM, 2008. Print # 67-96.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes includes [[offshoring]] (relocating a business function to a distant country)&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Paul. ''What's This India Business?: Offshoring, Outsourcing, and the Global Services Revolution''. London: Nicholas Brealey International, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[nearshoring]] (transferring a business process to a nearby country). Outsourcing is often confused with offshoring, however, they can be distinguished: a company can outsource (work with a service provider) and not offshore to a distant country. For example, in 2003 [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] outsourced their facilities' management support, but it did not involve offshoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2012/07/09/11898/5-facts-about-overseas-outsourcing/|title=5 Facts About Overseas Outsourcing|date=2012-07-09|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial savings from lower international labor rates can provide a major motivation for outsourcing or offshoring. There can be tremendous savings from lower international labor rates when offshoring.

In contrast, [[insourcing]] entails bringing processes handled by third-party firms in-house, and is sometimes accomplished via [[vertical integration]]. However, a business can provide a contract service to another organization without necessarily insourcing that business process.

==Overview==
Two organizations may enter into a contractual agreement involving an [[Financial transaction|exchange]] of [[Service (economics)|services]], expertise, and [[payments]]. Outsourcing is said to help firms to perform well in their core competencies, fuel innovation, and mitigate a shortage of skill or expertise in the areas where they want to outsource.&lt;ref&gt;Overby, S (2007) [http://www.cio.com/article/40380/ABC_An_Introduction_to_Outsourcing ABC: An Introduction to Outsourcing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630130752/http://www.cio.com/article/40380/ABC_An_Introduction_to_Outsourcing |date=2007-06-30 }}. CIO.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, businesses increasingly outsourced to suppliers outside their own country, sometimes referred to as offshoring or [[offshore outsourcing]]. Several related terms have emerged to refer to various aspects of the complex relationship between economic [[organizations]] or [[Business networking|networks]], such as [[nearshoring]], [[crowdsourcing]], [[multisourcing]],&lt;ref&gt;(Q4 2006)[http://www.btquarterly.com/?mc=mandatory-multisourcing-discipline&amp;page=ss-viewresearch Mandatory Multisourcing Discipline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928142453/http://www.btquarterly.com/?mc=mandatory-multisourcing-discipline&amp;page=ss-viewresearch |date=2007-09-28 }} Business Trends Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2006) [http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2006/gb20061108_738883.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business Mandatory Multisourcing Discipline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119082031/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2006/gb20061108_738883.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business |date=2007-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[strategic alliances]]/[[strategic partnerships]], strategic outsourcing.,&lt;ref&gt;see Holcomb &amp; Hitt, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[vested outsourcing]].

Outsourcing can offer greater budget flexibility and control. Outsourcing allows organizations to pay for the services and business functions they need, when they need them. It also reduces the need to hire and train specialized staff, brings in fresh [[engineering]] expertise, and can reduce capital, operating expenses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olive|first=B|title=Outsourcing Growing, Despite Controversy|journal=Power|year=2004|pages=148(4), 19–20.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and risk.

"Do what you do best and outsource the rest" has become an internationally recognized business tagline first "coined and developed"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haus|first1=Marian|title=Best 10 Peter Drucker quotes|url=http://pmseed.com/best-10-peter-drucker-quotes/|website=pmseed|publisher=pmseed|accessdate=26 April 2015|date=2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416043146/http://pmseed.com/best-10-peter-drucker-quotes/|archivedate=16 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s by the "legendary management consultant" [[Peter Drucker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vitasek|first1=Kate|title=A New way to Outsource|journal=Forbes|date=1 June 2011|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/06/01/vested-outsourcing-microsoft-intel-leadership-managing-kate-vitasek.html|accessdate=26 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415132447/http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/01/vested-outsourcing-microsoft-intel-leadership-managing-kate-vitasek.html|archivedate=15 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy. It has been said that Mr. Drucker began explaining the concept of "Outsourcing" as early as 1989 in his ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' article entitled "Sell the Mailroom."&lt;ref&gt;Drucker Peter F, (1989) "Sell the Mailroom," ''Wall Street Journal'', accessible at {{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113202230063197204 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522111235/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113202230063197204 |archivedate=2015-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Drucker's perspective, a company should only seek to subcontract in those areas in which it demonstrated no special ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wartzman|first1=Rick|title=The Drucker Difference:  Insourcing and Outsourcing: the Right Mix|journal=Bloomberg Business|date=5 February 2010|url=http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/feb2010/ca2010024_507452.htm|accessdate=6 May 2015|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522173550/http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/feb2010/ca2010024_507452.htm|archivedate=22 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The business strategy outlined by his slogan recommended that companies should take advantage of a specialist provider's knowledge and economies of scale to improve performance and achieve the service needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Gwynne|title=Warehouse Management: A Complete Guide To Improving Efficiency and Minimizing Costs In the Modern Warehouse|date=2014|publisher=Kogan Page Limited|location=Walnut Street Suite 1100 Philadelphia PA 19102|isbn=978 0 7494 6934 4|page=316|edition=Second|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oimhAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA316&amp;lpg=PA316&amp;dq=Do+what+you+do+best+and+outsource+the+rest+drucker+drucker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rE56Ap5bc9&amp;sig=g4gAp2w9iinUOujS7uJnJFDqqHI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Iac7VZH3DsKWNvDYgKgI&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Do%20what%20you%20do%20best%20and%20outsource%20the%20rest%20drucker%20drucker&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053857/https://books.google.com/books?id=oimhAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA316&amp;lpg=PA316&amp;dq=Do+what+you+do+best+and+outsource+the+rest+drucker+drucker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rE56Ap5bc9&amp;sig=g4gAp2w9iinUOujS7uJnJFDqqHI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Iac7VZH3DsKWNvDYgKgI&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Do%20what%20you%20do%20best%20and%20outsource%20the%20rest%20drucker%20drucker&amp;f=false|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 by way of recognition, Peter Drucker posthumously received a significant honor, when he was inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame for his outstanding work in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wartzman|first1=Rick|title=Insourcing and Outsourcing: the Right Mix|journal=Bloomberg Business|date=February 2010|url=http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/feb2010/ca2010024_507452.htm|accessdate=26 April 2015|publisher=Bloomberg Business.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522173550/http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/feb2010/ca2010024_507452.htm|archivedate=22 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outsourcing models ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2018}}
A serial report published in the 2010s looking at outsourcing models in [[clinical development]] described seven distinct models: Preferred Provider, Fee-for-Service, Functional Service Provider (FSP), Hybrid Full Service/FSP, In-Sourced, Compound/Program-based, and Sole-Source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Miseta|first=Ed|date=August 20, 2018|title=Clinical Outsourcing Models: Still A Lot Of Churn And Uncertainty|url=https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/clinical-outsourcing-models-still-a-lot-of-churn-and-uncertainty-0001|department=From the Editor|magazine=Clinical Leader|type=Interview of Andrew Schafer|publisher=VertMarkets, Inc.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for outsourcing===
Companies primarily outsource to reduce certain costs, which may include peripheral or "non-core" business expenses,&lt;ref&gt;Forey, Gail, and Jane Lockwood. Globalization, Communication and the Workplace: Talking across the World. New York: Continuum, 2011. Electronic Book #21-26.&lt;/ref&gt; high taxes, high energy costs, excessive government regulation or mandates, and production or labor costs. The incentive to outsource may be greater for U.S. companies due to unusually high corporate taxes and mandated benefits like [[social security]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and safety protection ([[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] regulations).&lt;ref&gt;Buchholz, Todd G. Bringing the Jobs Home: How the Left Created the Outsourcing Crisis&amp;nbsp;— and How We Can Fix It. New York: Sentinel, 2004. Print 97-118.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it appears U.S. companies do not outsource to reduce executive or managerial costs. For instance, [[executive pay in the United States]] in 2007 was more than 400 times more than average workers—a gap 20 times bigger than it was in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Albert R. "Letter From Washington: As U.S. rich-poor gap grows, so does public outcry" NY Times 2/18/2007&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons include:
*Reducing and controlling operating costs.
*Improving company focus.
*Gaining access to world-class capabilities.
*Freeing internal resources for other purposes. 
*Streamlining or increasing efficiency for time-consuming functions. 
*Maximizing use of external resources.

===White-collar outsourcing===
Outsourcing of [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] work has grown rapidly since the early 21st century, despite a focus on manufacturing outsourcing. The [[digital workplace|digital workforce]] of countries like [[India]] and [[China]] are only paid a fraction of what would be [[minimum wage]] in the US. On average, [[software engineers]] are getting paid between 250,000 and 1,500,000 rupees (US$4,000 to US$23,000) in India as opposed to $40,000–$100,000 in countries such as the [[US]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="Gillis"&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/203549187 Gillis, A. (2001, Digital sweatshops. This, 34, 6-6.]&lt;/ref&gt; Outsourcing has also expanded to include many different countries; [[Costa Rica]] has become a big source for outsourcing work as it offers the advantage of a highly educated labor force, a large bilingual population, stable democratic government, shares similar time zones with the United States, and it takes only a few hours to travel between Costa Rica and the US. Companies such as Intel, Procter &amp; Gamble, HP, Gensler, Amazon and Bank of America have big operations in Costa Rica.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the recent years there has been an exponential growth in white collar work with service providers emerging in a wide range of activities, from banking and legal services to companies like Resources US,&lt;ref name="Resources US"&gt;[http://www.resourcesus.net Resources US pioneer in outsourcing services to US architecture firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611173821/http://www.resourcesus.net/ |date=2016-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a pioneer in outsourcing services for architecture firms in United States. Unlike outsourced manufacturing, outsourced white collar work, offers workers the flexibility to choose their working hours, and which companies to work for. With many individuals [[telecommuting]] from home, the companies that require this type of work do not need to allocate additional funds for setting up of office space, management salary, and employee benefits as these individuals are [[independent contractor|contracted workers]].&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;Ross, J; Irani, L; Silberman, M.S.; Zaldivar, A; Tomlinson, B (2010). "Who are the Crowdworkers? Shifting Demographics in Mechanical Turk". CHI 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

===For business===

====Management processes====
Globalization and complex [[supply chains]], along with greater physical distance between higher management and the production-floor employees often requires a change in management methodologies, as inspection and feedback may not be as direct and frequent as in internal processes. This often requires the assimilation of new communication methods such as [[voice over IP]], [[instant messaging]], and [[Issue tracking]] systems, new [[time management]] methods such as [[Comparison of time tracking software|time tracking software]], and new cost- and schedule-assessment tools such as [[Comparison of development estimation software|cost estimation software]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====Communications and customer service====
In the area of [[call center]] outsourcing, organizations that are not experienced in working with outsourced call centers may suffer from lower end-user-experience as a result of outsourcing. This is exacerbated when outsourcing is combined with offshoring in regions where the first language and culture are different.&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, S (2009) [http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf Macaulay's (Cyber) Children: The Cultural Politics of Outsourcing in India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620105537/http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf |date=2010-06-20 }}. Cultural Sociology.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, foreign [[call center]] agents may speak with different [[linguistics|linguistic]] features such as [[Accent (dialect)|accents]], word use and phraseology, which may impede comprehension. The visual cues that are missing in a  [[telephone call]] may lead to misunderstandings and difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Alster, N (2005) [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/4390954/c_2984406/?f=archives Customer Disservice.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702092211/http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/4390954/c_2984406/?f=archives |date=2007-07-02 }} www.CFO.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Governance====
In 1979, Nobel laureate [[Oliver E. Williamson]] wrote that the governance structure is the "framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided." Adding further that "because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction."&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1979) "Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations," Journal of Law and Economics: Vol. 22: No. 2, Article 3|accessible at: {{cite web |url=http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919093134/http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3/ |archivedate=2016-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; University of Tennessee researchers have been studying complex outsourcing relationships since 2003. Emerging thinking regarding strategic outsourcing is focusing on creating a contract structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex business arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, ﬂexible, and credible way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vitasek|first=Kate, et. al.|title=The Vested Outsourcing Manual|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0230112684|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Security====
Before outsourcing, an organization is responsible for the actions of their entire staff, sometimes a substantial liability. When these same people are transferred to an outsource service provider, they may not even change desks. But their legal status changes. They are no longer directly employed by (and responsible to) the organization. This creates legal, security and compliance issues that are often addressed through the contract between the client and the suppliers. This is one of the most complex areas of outsourcing and sometimes involves a specialist third-party adviser.

Fraud is a specific security issue as well as criminal activity, whether it is by employees or the supplier staff. However, it can be disputed that fraud is more likely when outsourcing is involved. For example, in April 2005, a high-profile case involved the theft of $350,000 from four [[Citibank]] customers when call-center workers acquired the passwords to customer accounts and transferred the money to their own accounts opened under fictitious names. Citibank did not find out about the problem until the American customers noticed discrepancies with their accounts and notified the bank.&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro, J (2005) [http://www.infoworld.com/article/2668975/application-development/indian-call-center-workers-charged-with-citibank-fraud.html Indian call center workers charged with Citibank fraud] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042721/http://www.infoworld.com/article/2668975/application-development/indian-call-center-workers-charged-with-citibank-fraud.html |date=2015-09-24 }}. www.infoworld.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insourcing===
Outsourcing has gone through many iterations and reinventions. Some outsourcing contracts have been partially or fully reversed, citing an inability to execute strategy, lost transparency &amp; control, onerous contractual models, a lack of competition, recurring costs, hidden costs, and so on. Companies shifting to [[insourcing]] often cite the desire to increase control, compliance and to gain competitive differentiation through vertical integration or the development of shared services, commonly called a [[center of excellence]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Further, the label ''outsourcing'' has been found to be used for too many different kinds of exchanges often in confusing ways. For example, global software development, which often involves people working in different countries, cannot simply be called outsourcing. The outsourcing-based market model fails to explain why these development projects are jointly developed, and not simply bought and sold in the marketplace. Recently, a study has identified an additional system of governance, termed algocracy, which appears to govern global software projects alongside bureaucratic and market-based mechanisms. The study&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Aneesh|Aneesh]], A. Global Labor: Algocratic Modes of Organization, Sociological Theory 27:4 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes code-based governance system from bureaucracy and the market, and underscores the prominent features of each organizational form in terms of its ruling mechanism: bureaucracy (legal-rational), the market (price), and algocracy (programming or algorithm). So, global software development projects, though not insourced, are not outsourced either. They are in-between, in a process that is sometimes termed "remote in-sourcing."&lt;ref&gt;BPM Watch: {{cite web |url=http://www.bpmwatch.com/columns/in-sourcing-a-closer-look-at-an-emerging-outsourcing-trend/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303212216/http://www.bpmwatch.com/columns/in-sourcing-a-closer-look-at-an-emerging-outsourcing-trend/ |archivedate=2013-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects are developed together where a common software platform allows different teams around the world to work on the same project together.

===Standpoint of labor===
From the standpoint of labor, outsourcing may represent a new threat, contributing to worker insecurity, and is reflective of the general process of [[globalization]] and [[Polarization (economics)|economic polarization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul]] (2006). "Feeling No Pain." ''New York Times'', March 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2009, [[Jeff Immelt]], the CEO of [[General Electric]], called for the United States to increase its manufacturing base employment to 20% of the workforce, commenting that the U.S. has outsourced too much and can no longer rely on consumer spending to drive demand.&lt;ref name=Immelt&gt;Bailey, David and Soyoung Kim (June 26, 2009).[https://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/8578904 GE's Immelt says U.S. economy needs industrial renewal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611181851/http://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/8578904 |date=2015-06-11 }}.''UK Guardian.''. Retrieved on June 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standpoint of government===
Western governments may attempt to compensate workers affected by outsourcing through various forms of legislation. In Europe, the [[Acquired Rights Directive]] attempts to address the issue. The Directive is implemented differently in different nations. In the United States, the [[Trade Adjustment Assistance]] Act is meant to provide compensation for workers directly affected by international trade agreements. Whether or not these policies provide the security and fair compensation they promise is debatable.

====Policy-making strategy====
A main feature of outsourcing influencing policy-making is the unpredictability it generates regarding the future of any particular sector or skill-group. The uncertainty of future conditions influences governance approaches to different aspects of long-term policies.

=====Competitiveness strategy=====
Economic growth requires change, therefore a governance disposed to helping social and economic structures adapt to the changing environment will facilitate growth and a stable transition to new economic structures&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006"&gt;Baldwin, Richard. (2006). "Globalisation: the great unbludning(s)," Chapter 1, in Globalization Challenges for Europe, Secretariat of the Economic Council, Finnish Prime Minister's Office, Helsinki, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; until the economic structures become detrimental to the social, political and cultural structures.

In [[Developing country|developing countries]], policies that embrace the global phenomenon of outsourcing are a logical response to the ongoing movement towards "open markets" and "trade liberalization." Outsourcing, when interpreted as a trade phenomenon, complements trade liberalization strategies not only by promoting technological spillovers and capital inflows but also by offsetting the increasing levels of unemployment which result from opening up domestic markets. As prices adjust to those in the global market they no longer reflect domestic productivity, driving lower-productivity firms in the previously protected sectors out of business. Economic theorists argue that the resulting unemployment is only temporary as workers readjust and are eventually incorporated into the country's most productive sectors, namely those which enjoy a competitive edge over other players in the international market. Nonetheless, rapid liberalization of markets in developing countries has not maximized the productivity potential of the region. In the Global South, where technological development is drastically lower than in the North, the redeployment of human and capital resources into new export markets has not come at the cost of necessarily low-productivity sectors but rather underdeveloped ones. In other words, many of the previously protected sectors were not competitive yet on a global scale, not because they naturally lacked the comparative advantage, but because industry efficiency had not yet been reached.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz, J. And Charlton 2005"&gt;Stiglitz, J. And Charlton, A., (2005). "Trade can be Good for Development," Ch. 2 in Fair Trade for All, Oxford University Press, Oxford, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases where liberalization stunts the growth of potential industries, unemployment is a reflection of many underemployed resources.

Outsourcing fills in the gap of receding protected national industries, improving employment and living standards. Among other economic externalities, outsourcing promotes capital inflows and infrastructure. In Mexico, wage convergence was faster in cities where outsourcing first took hold through [[maquiladora]]s, along the [[Mexico–United States border]]. Studies suggest that for every 10% increase in US wages, northern cities in Mexico which are most influenced by outsourcing would experience wage rises of 2.5%, about 0.69% higher than in inner cities.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, G. (2003), "What Has Happened to Wages in Mexico Since NAFTA", NBER Working Paper Series, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption and reduced tax revenues after the signing of [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] have limited the economic resources available to the Mexican government, thus explaining the difference in investment policies between Mexico and China.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz, J. And Charlton 2005" /&gt; Conversely, one of the successes of Asian countries in the twentieth century has been their promotion of higher rates of saving and investment. Studies suggest that the increase in capital input fueled the ‘Asian miracle’ rather than improvements in productivity and industrial efficiency. Though the previous conclusion suggests production conditions in the region remained static, the situation in East Asia experienced rapid transformations. Not only were national educational rates raised drastically, but there was also an increase in patenting and research and development expenditures. Rising levels of education, urbanization and even of patenting illustrate the active role of the government in advancing education as well as encouraging research and development.&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, P., Obtsfeld, M. And Melitz, M., (2012) "East Asia: Success and Crisis", in International Economics: Theory and Policy, Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Education strategy=====
Jobs become outsourced not based on the skill-level group it represents, but rather based on a variety of other factors including transportation cost of ideas, wage and labour productivity edge.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006"/&gt; Because of the overall uncertainty regarding the future dynamics of outsourcing it is not possible to predict the nature of labour demand in different regions. To better prepare the domestic workforce to future industry demands, therefore, national education programs ought to focus on flexibility and diversity of skills rather than on any specific task-oriented skills. Emphasis should go on preparing students both to succeed in non-habitual tasks and to adapt to changes in labour demands in the market.&lt;ref&gt;Blinder, A. (2006), "Offshoring: The Next Industrial Revolution?" Foreign Affairs, 85:2, 113.128&lt;/ref&gt; A specific goal that ought to be adopted is teaching students how to learn rather than teach them particular skills. This strategy would help students adapt to changing skill requirements in the future thus reducing friction from structural unemployment.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006"/&gt;

=====Welfare state strategy=====
The uncertainty regarding the domestic productivity edge renders caution a key element of governance to ensure a sustainable regional developmenloyed{{Neologism inline|date=May 2017}} re-enter the work force and smoothly transition into high-demand labour opportunities, potentially through re-training programs, the government{{Who|date=May 2017}} should also address the socioeconomic struggle and other welfare concerns of displaced employees.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Richard. (2006). "Globalisation: the great unbludning(s)," Chapter 1, in Globalization Challenges for Europe, Secretariat of the Economic Council, Finnish Prime Minister's Office, Helsinki, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative welfare effects of outsourcing have gathered substantial public attention. The possibility of outsourcing has internationalized labour markets which used to be local, opening up jobs which were traditionally non-traded to international competition. The resulting combination of lower wages and unemployment for certain jobs has driven the perceived ‘losers’ to engage in heated political debate.

Labour unions in the European Union have succeeded in pushing through protectionist policies in favour or lower-skilled groups throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including the Common Agricultural Policy on farming.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006" /&gt; Interest groups opposing outsourcing have been more active to voice their disapproval because the negative outcomes of the phenomenon are more concentrated on specific groups of people, namely those losing jobs to external competition, whereas the benefits from it become dissipated among the population at large. Overall lower prices and greater quality and variety of goods in domestic markets are some of the benefits of exploiting a country's comparative advantage through outsourcing.

Unlike the alleged ‘losers’ from outsourcing, those affected positively by it lack the motivation to organize to voice their support. There has been a wave of protectionism{{When|date=May 2017}} concerned with deep changes in the social structure allegedly imposed on the global system through globalization and outsourcing. The activists{{Who|date=May 2017}} see a readjustment of class systems and highlight an increased fracture in societies between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’ as different groups adjust to increasingly or decreasingly advantageous positions in the system of outsourcing. Opponents of outsourcing have also denounced it as a threat to local cultural integrity.

The argument on cultural disintegration points to the standardization of practices and norms as multinational corporations become involved with industries in regions culturally different from those in the country of origin. The alleged diffusion of culture has raised concern over the endurance of cultural norms and values, sociopolitical institutions and frameworks, or even cultural preferences and traditions in a context of increasing foreign presence.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrik, D., (2007), "Globalization for Whom", Ch. 9 in One Economics Many Recipes, Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased uncertainty regarding future socioeconomic security ought to be met with policies promoting equality and a fair redistribution of economic gains for a government to maintain its voters’ favour. Because of overall unpredictability, governments will likely need to reassure civilians that the burden of employment jobs resulting from outsourcing will be shared among taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006" /&gt;

The fluctuations in employment levels are determined by the types of jobs which can be profitably outsourced or offshored. Domestic jobs become offshored or outsourced when lower productivity in other regions is compensated by lower wages, making outsourcing profitable even despite the added costs of transportation. The overall cost-effectiveness of the spatial unbundling of the industrial process thus depends on the cost of transporting specific services or ideas given the available technology. Because of these technological advancements such as the telecommunications revolution, air shipping or the Internet have deeply accelerated outsourcing and may continue to boost this process.

The future results of technological ingenuity and innovation are unknown, as are its potential impacts employment levels on any given task or job across regions.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006" /&gt; In the [[Global South]], policies attracting multinational corporations can help increase employment levels and promote growth. Governments that pursue these policies facilitate welfare protection given the context of increased unemployment in industries which cannot compete with the international market due to trade liberalization policies.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz, J. And Charlton 2005" /&gt;

=====Industrial policy=====
Outsourcing results from an internationalization of labor markets as more tasks become tradable. According to leading economist Greg Mankiw, the labour market functions under the same forces as the market of goods, with the underlying implication that the greater the number of tasks available to being moved, the better for efficiency under the gains from trade. With technological progress, more tasks can be offshored at different stages of the overall corporate process.&lt;ref&gt;Mankiw, G. and Swagel, P. (2005). "The Politics and Economics of Offshore Outsourcing," working paper for the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Environmental policy=====
There are widespread claims that outsourcing has pushed environmental standards down in developing regions as countries compete to attract foreign projects and investment. Similar to lower wages, lower health and environmental regulations contribute to giving a country a comparative advantage over another due to lower production costs. The controversy this raises, however, is that unlike wages, lower health or environmental standards does benefit the new employees joining the workforce.
Import competition has caused a de facto ‘race-to-the-bottom’ where countries lower environmental regulations to secure a competitive edge for their industries relative to other countries. As Mexico competes with China over Canadian and American markets, its national Commission for Environmental Cooperation has not been active in enacting or enforcing regulations to prevent environmental damage from increasingly industrialized Export Processing Zones. Similarly, since the signing of NAFTA heavy industries have increasingly moved to the US which has a comparative advantage due to its abundant presence of capital and well-developed technology. A further example of environmental de-regulation with the objective of protecting trade incentives have been the numerous exemptions to carbon taxes in European countries during the 1990s. The evidence suggests that even if outsourcing has promoted lower environmental protection, there are no intrinsic geographic implications that the Global South has been more negatively affected than the North. o Although outsourcing can influence environmental de-regulatory trends, the added cost of preventing pollution does not majorly determine trade flows or industrialization.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, B. (2007), "Trade and the Environment: What do we do now", Ch. 39 in Handbook on International Trade Policy, ed. Kerr, W and Gaosford, J., Edward Elgar Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization and socio-economic implications===
{{Main|Globalization}}

====Global inequality and development====

=====Industrialization=====
Outsourcing has contributed to further levelling of global inequalities as it has led to general trends of industrialization in the Global South and deindustrialization in the Global North.

Even though outsourcing has promoted a movement of industrial sites from the Global North to Global South regions, it has not been the only reason for the concurrent deindustrialization and industrialization of the North and South respectively. Deindustrialization in more economically and technologically developed regions has also been affected by increased industrial productivity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Baldwin, Richard. (2006). "Globalisation: the great unbundling(s)," Chapter 1, in Globalization Challenges for Europe, Secretariat of the Economic Council, Finnish Prime Minister's Office, Helsinki, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in industrial efficiency which characterized development in developed countries has occurred as a result of labor-saving technological improvements. Although these improvements do not directly reduce employment levels but rather increase output per unit of work, they can indirectly diminish the amount of labor required for fixed levels of output.&lt;ref&gt;Easterly, W. (2002), "Solow's Surprise: Investment is not the Key to Growth", Ch. 3 in The Elusive Quest for Growth, The MIT Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a trending shift in demand towards non-tradable services such as those in the health-care or government sectors has further accelerated deindustrialization in the Global North. Since these tasks cannot be outsourced, the demand for them needs to be met domestically abiding by the local market price. Consequently, a shift in the labor force towards fulfilling these profitable services has mostly taken place at the expense of industry since the agricultural sector in the early industrializing Global North had already been maximizing its labour capacity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Despite the variety of domestic and international factors affecting deindustrialization in the Global North, those concerning the external influence of the global market have been the most influential ones since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Rowthorn, R. and Coutts, K. ( 2004), "Deindustrialization and the balance of payments in advanced economies," UNCTAD Discussion Paper No.170&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent industrialization process outsourcing has encouraged in the Global South has taken place at a much faster pace than it did during its beginnings in the North, given that the well-developed technology was already developed, and merely spread to further regions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=====Growth and income=====
The almost simultaneous industrialization of the developing Global South and deindustrialization of the more developed Global North resulted in an international convergence of incomes.

Outsourcing has been characterized by rapid rates of growth and industrialization in the Global South. Conversely, the Global North has experienced a moderate slowdown in growth. Patterns of global industrialization and deindustrialization are explained by a combination of models in economic geography and economic growth. Models in economic geography illustrate that decreasing communication costs reduce the spatial clustering of industrial development. The lower cost to the spread of ideas improved coordination and communication within corporations across greater geographic distances. This process originated roughly after the international chaos of the World Wars, as a consequence of advancements in information technology during the 1960s. Further adaptations to technological progress, particularly the spread of the internet and liberalization of the telecommunications industry, permitted an acceleration of the movement of ideas and consequently of outsourcing since about the 1980s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=====Urbanization=====
The pace of urbanization in the Global North decreased considerably relative to its high levels following the Industrial Revolution. Rates of urban growth have been higher in the Global South.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Richard. (2006), "Globalisation: the great unbundling(s)," Chapter 1, in Globalization Challenges for Europe, Secretariat of the Economic Council, Finnish Prime Minister's Office, Helsinki, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trade====
Outsourcing emerged with a new wave of globalization marked by high volumes of trade and capital flows. The increased movement of capital and goods contrasted starkly with the barriers and protectionism prevalent throughout the World Wars and the Great Depression during the Interwar Years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Migration====
The level of migration has remained relatively low, particularly compared to the mass migratory trends which characterized the Industrial Revolution roughly between 1850 and 1914.,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; probably because labor markets are not free now. Countries now have discrimination labor laws, only allow people with citizenship cards live and work free in their territories, even getting a citizenship card is difficult for some one not born in their territory. Free labor markets, discrimination based with a person skills would help reduce outsourcing problems, letting people freely follow their jobs in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chang|first=Howard|title=Cultural Communities in a Global Labor Market: Immigration Restrictions as Residential Segregation|year=2007|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Law School|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Domestic inequality====
Outsourcing in the Global North led to a rising divergence in domestic employment levels in different tasks within a given industry, making tackling unemployment more difficult for governments as job losses ceased to be primarily sectoral.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==By country==

===United States===
"Outsourcing" has become a continuing political issue in the United States, having been conflated with offshoring, during the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]]. The political debate centered on outsourcing's consequences for the domestic U.S. workforce. [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] U.S. presidential candidate [[John Kerry]] criticized U.S. firms that outsource jobs abroad or that incorporate overseas in [[tax haven]]s to avoid paying their "fair share" of [[Taxation in the United States|U.S. taxes]] during his 2004 campaign, calling such firms "[[Benedict Arnold]] corporations".

Criticism of outsourcing, from the perspective of [[U.S. citizen]]s, generally revolves around the costs associated with transferring control of the labor process to an external entity in another country. A [[Zogby International]] poll conducted in August 2004 found that 71% of American voters believed that "outsourcing jobs overseas" hurt the economy while another 62% believed that the U.S. government should impose some legislative action against companies that transfer domestic jobs overseas, possibly in the form of increased taxes on companies that outsource.&lt;ref&gt;Zogby International survey results online at [http://www.zogby.com/news/2004/09/22/majority-of-americans-71-say-outsourcing-jobs-overseas-bad-for-us-economy-china-viewed-as-greatest-e/ zogby.com]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; One prediction (form 2010) claims that, by 2014, more than 1.3 million positions will disappear because of "the accelerated movement of work to India ..." and some other countries willing to accept outsourced jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Bonasia, J. (2010, December 03). Offshoring, for good or ill, comes of age putting India on the map competitive world markets demand outsourcing, but it does drain domestic jobs. Investor's Business Daily. A04.&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama promoted an act titled '[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s3364 Bring Jobs Home Act]' that would help reshore jobs by giving incentives such as a tax cut or a 20 percent tax credit for moving operations back to the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Documents and Publications.

Labor advocates accuse [[union busting]] as one possible cause of outsourcing. They argue that as unions are disadvantaged by union busting legislation, workers lose bargaining power and it becomes easier for corporations to fire them and ship their job overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another rationale is the high corporate income tax rate in the U.S. relative to other OECD nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/1466.html |title=U.S. Lagging Behind OECD Corporate Tax Trends |publisher=The Tax Foundation |date=2006-05-05 |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706032603/http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/1466.html |archivedate=2009-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Tamny |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODZjNjI4ZTNjZmNiOGMxYjAwOTg1ZGI0NmFiOWFjZjI= |title=John Tamny on Hillary Clinton Economics on NRO Financial |publisher=Article.nationalreview.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109171714/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODZjNjI4ZTNjZmNiOGMxYjAwOTg1ZGI0NmFiOWFjZjI= |archivedate=2009-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=June 2018}} and the practice of taxing revenues earned outside of U.S. jurisdiction, a very uncommon practice. However, outsourcing is not solely a U.S. phenomenon as corporations in various nations with low tax rates outsource as well, which means that high taxation can only partially, if at all, explain US outsourcing. For example, the amount of corporate outsourcing in 1950 would be considerably lower than today,{{when|date=June 2018}} yet the tax rate was actually higher in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also suggested that lowering the corporate income tax and ending the double-taxation of foreign-derived revenue (taxed once in the nation where the revenue was raised, and once from the U.S.) will alleviate corporate outsourcing and make the U.S. more attractive to foreign companies. However, while the US has a high official tax rate, the actual taxes paid by US corporations may be considerably lower due to the use of tax loopholes, tax havens, and "gaming the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/high-corporate-tax-rate-is-misleading-22463/ |title=High Corporate Tax Rate Is Misleading at |publisher=Smartmoney.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210200332/http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/high-corporate-tax-rate-is-misleading-22463/ |archivedate=2010-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than avoiding taxes, outsourcing may be mostly driven by the desire to lower labor costs (see standpoint of labor above). [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] has also been cited as a factor for corporate flight from U.S. jurisdiction.

Where outsourcing involves the transfer of an undertaking, it is subject to Council Directive 77/187 of 14 February 1977, on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees’ rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses (as amended by Directive 98/50/EC of 29 June 1998; consolidated in Directive 2001/23 of 12 March 2001). Under that directive, rights acquired by employees with the former employer are to be safeguarded when they, together with the undertaking in which they are employed, are transferred to another employer, i.e., the contractor. An example of a case involving such contracting-out was the decision of the European Court of Justice in Christel Schmidt v. Spar- und Leihkasse der früheren Ämter Bordesholm, Kiel und Cronshagen, Case C-392/92 [1994]. Although subsequent decisions have disputed whether a particular contracting-out exercise constituted a transfer of an undertaking (see, for example, [[Süzen v Zehnacker Gebaeudereingung GmbH|Ayse Süzen v. Zehnacker Gebäudereinigung GmbH Krankenhausservice]], Case C-13/95 [1997]), in principle, employees of an enterprise outsourcing part of its activities in which they are employed may benefit from the protection offered by the directive.

Seeking to implement the cost-cutting solutions, many Western European firms have been transferring tech projects eastward. For example, Deutsche Bank has some of its software developed in Ukraine, Siemens possess R&amp;D center in Romania. Europe Outsourcing has produced outstanding results and henceforward they are increasing them in numbers.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Despite unfavorable economic conditions from 2007 to 2009, the outsourcing services market continued to flourish in Central and Eastern European. In 2008 when the inflow of investment in Western Europe was down by 48%, it fell by only 9% in Central and Eastern Europe. In [[Poland]] alone, during 2009, the year following the global economic downturn, approximately 10,000 jobs were created in [[business process outsourcing]] (BPO).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Co-sourcing==
'''Co-sourcing''' is a business practice where a service is performed by staff from inside an organization and also by an external service provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=80237620 | title='Co-Sourcing' and More | publisher=hreonline.com | date=March 16, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2012 | author=McIlvaine, Andrew R. | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513092203/http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=80237620 | archivedate=May 13, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/6502924 | title=Out With 'Outsourcing' And In With 'Co-Sourcing' | publisher=informationweek.com | date=September 2, 2002 | accessdate=May 23, 2012 | author=Khirallah, Diane Rezendes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be a service performed in concert with a [[customer|client]]'s existing internal [[audit]] department. The scope of work may focus on one or more aspects of the [[internal audit]] function. Co-sourcing can serve to minimize sourcing risks, increase transparency, clarity and lend toward better control over the processes outsourced.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary: {{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/co-sourcing.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819235940/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/co-sourcing.html |archivedate=2016-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of co-sourcing services are supplementing the in-house internal audit staff with specialized skills such as information [[risk management]] or integrity services, providing routine assistance to in-house auditing for operations and control evaluations in peak period activity and conducting special projects such as fraud investigation or plant investment appraisals. Another example of co-sourcing is outsourcing part of [[software development]] or [[software maintenance]] activities to an external [[organization]], while keeping part of the development in-house. Other internal business activities such as [[Human Resources|HR]] and administrative tasks can also be co-sourced by [[Professional Employer Organization|employee leasing]] companies.

===Identity management co-sourcing===
It is an approach to enterprise [[identity management]] in which the identity service interacts directly or through some technical footprint with an organization's [[Information Technology]] (IT) identity back-end infrastructure: [[directory service|directories]], [[database]]s, and other identity repositories. The organization and the external service provider typically have a shared responsibility for building, hosting and operating the identity service. The balance of this responsibility can vary depending on the service levels required, and span from an all on-premises deployment, where the identity service is built, hosted and operated within the organization's [[IT infrastructure]] and managed on-premises by the external service provider. This contrasts with an "all in-the-cloud" service scenario, where the identity service is built, hosted and operated by the service provider in an externally hosted, [[cloud computing]] infrastructure.

==Counterwave outsourcing==
Some firms have reversed the decision to outsource because the results were not entirely as expected. The circumstances which allow firms to unbundle the different tasks or stages of its manufacturing process into different locations have not been fully determined. Though the nature of the tasks plays a role determining their interconnectedness, other factors such as innovation in the manufacturing process or advances in transport and communication technology also affect the need for direct contact among employees. As the process which ties tasks together within firms remains unclear, there is a degree of uncertainty about which tasks need to remain geographically clustered together. In many cases firms took risks experimenting with outsourcing while lacking a firm understanding of the relationship among internal tasks and its spatial implications.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Despite saving money, companies have often faced unexpected drawbacks from outsourcing, such as miscommunication or lower quality of intermediate products, which end up delaying the overall production process. Another reason for a decrease in outsourcing is that many jobs that were subcontracted abroad have been replaced by technological advances.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

According to a Deloitte Consulting survey carried out in 2005, a quarter of the companies which had outsourced tasks reversed their strategy. Many big companies like Lenovo considered turning around outsourcing strategies of outsourcing.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569572-after-decades-sending-work-across-world-companies-are-rethinking-their-offshoring|title=Here, There and Everywhere|publisher=''[[The Economist]] [London] n.d.: n. pag.|date=17 January 2013|accessdate=19 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118202607/http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569572-after-decades-sending-work-across-world-companies-are-rethinking-their-offshoring|archivedate=18 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public opinion in the US and other Western powers opposing outsourcing was particularly strengthened by the drastic increase in unemployment as a result of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In the first decade from 2000 to 2010, the US experienced a net loss of 687,000 jobs due to outsourcing, primarily in the computers and electronics sector. Public disenchantment with outsourcing has not only stirred political responses, as seen in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 US presidential campaigns]], but it has also made companies more reluctant to outsource or offshore jobs.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

A 2016 Deloitte survey suggested that companies are no longer reluctant to outsource.&lt;ref&gt;"Outsourcing accelerates forward," (2016) Deloitte 2016 Global Outsourcing Survey accessed 18 August 2016 at {{cite web |url=http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-cons-sdt-gos-exec-summary-2016.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112100552/https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-cons-sdt-gos-exec-summary-2016.pdf |archivedate=2017-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deloitte's survey identified three trends: 
*Companies are broadening their approach to outsourcing as they begin to view it as more than a simple cost-cutting play
*Organizations are "redefining the ways they enter into outsourcing relationships and manage the ensuing risks."  
*Organizations are changing the way they are managing their relationships with outsourcing providers to "maximize the value of those relationships."

'''''Proč právě Zeman?''''' (English: ''Why Zeman?'') is a book by Czech authors [[Jan Herzmann]] and [[Martin Komárek]], about [[Miloš Zeman]]'s [[Czech presidential election, 2013|2013 presidential campaign]] and reasons for his victory. It was published in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KNIHA: Proč právě Zeman?|url=http://neviditelnypes.lidovky.cz/kniha-proc-prave-zeman-06u-/p_politika.aspx?c=A130311_100543_p_politika_wag|website=Lidovky.cz|accessdate=15 February 2017|date=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proč právě Herzmann?

'''''Realpolitik''''' (from {{lang-de|real}}; "realistic", "practical", or "actual"; and ''{{lang|de|Politik}}''; "politics", {{IPA-de|ʁeˈaːlpoliˌtiːk}}) is politics or diplomacy based primarily on considerations of given circumstances and factors, rather than explicit ideological notions or moral and ethical premises. In this respect, it shares aspects of its philosophical approach with those of [[Realism (international relations)|realism]] and [[pragmatism]]. It is often simply referred to as "'''pragmatism'''" in politics, e.g. "pursuing pragmatic policies". The term ''Realpolitik'' is sometimes used pejoratively to imply politics that are perceived as [[Coercion|coercive]], [[Amorality|amoral]], or [[Machiavellian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Humphreys|first1=Adam R. C.|title=Realpolitik|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118474396.wbept0865/abstract|website=The Encyclopedia of Political Thought|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118474396.wbept0865/abstract|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==
The term ''Realpolitik'' was coined by [[Ludwig von Rochau]], a German writer and politician in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="haslam"&gt;{{cite book |title=No Virtue Like Necessity: Realist Thought in International Relations since Machiavelli |last=Haslam |first=Jonathan |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=London |isbn=0-300-09150-8 |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1853 book ''Grundsätze der Realpolitik angewendet auf die staatlichen Zustände Deutschlands'' describes the meaning of the term:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AGVCAAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=Die%20politischen%20Organismus%20der%20menschlichen%20Gesellschaft&amp;pg=PA1#v=snippet&amp;q=Die%20politischen%20Organismus%20der%20menschlichen%20Gesellschaft&amp;f=false|title=Grundsätze der Realpolitik angewendet auf die staatlichen Zustände Deutschlands|author=von Rochau, Ludwig}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The study of the forces that shape, maintain and alter the state is the basis of all political insight and leads to the understanding that the law of power governs the world of states just as the law of gravity governs the physical world. The older political science was fully aware of this truth but drew a wrong and detrimental conclusion—the right of the more powerful. The modern era has corrected this unethical fallacy, but while breaking with the alleged right of the more powerful one, the modern era was too much inclined to overlook the real might of the more powerful and the inevitability of its political influence.}}

Historian John Bew suggests that much of what stands for modern ''Realpolitik'' today deviates from the original meaning of the term. ''Realpolitik'' emerged in mid-19th century Europe from the collision of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] with state formation and power politics. The concept, Bew argues, was an early attempt at answering the conundrum of how to achieve [[Liberalism|liberal]] enlightened goals in a world that does not follow liberal enlightened rules.

Publicist, journalist and liberal political reformer Von Rochau coined the term in 1853 and added a second volume in 1869 that further refined his earlier arguments. Rochau, exiled in Paris until the 1848 uprising, returned during the revolution and became a well-known figure in the national liberal party. As the liberal gains of the 1848 revolutions fell victim to coercive governments or were swallowed by powerful social forces such as class, religion and nationalism, Rochau—according to Bew—began to think hard about how the work that had begun with such enthusiasm had failed to yield any lasting results.

He said that the great achievement of the Enlightenment had been to show that might is not necessarily right. The mistake liberals made was to assume that the law of the strong had suddenly evaporated simply because it had been shown to be unjust. Rochau wrote that "to bring down the walls of Jericho, the Realpolitiker knows the simple pickaxe is more useful than the mightiest trumpet". Rochau's concept was seized upon by German thinkers in the mid and late 19th century and became associated with [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s statecraft in [[unification of Germany|unifying Germany]] in the mid 19th century. By 1890, usage of the word ''Realpolitik'' was widespread, yet increasingly detached from its original meaning.&lt;ref name="Bew"&gt;{{cite book |title=Real Realpolitik: A History |last=Bew |first=John |year=2014 |publisher=The Library of Congress |location=Washington, D.C.| url=https://www.loc.gov/today/cyberlc/feature_wdesc.php?rec=6285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political realism in international relations ==
Whereas ''Realpolitik'' refers to political practice, the concept of [[Realism (international relations)|political realism in international relations]] refers to a theoretical framework aimed at offering explanations for events in the [[international relations]] domain. The theory of political realism proceeds from the assumption that states—as actors in the international arena—pursue their interests by practising ''Realpolitik''. Conversely, ''Realpolitik'' can be described as the exercise of policies that are in line with accepted theories of political realism. In either case, the working hypothesis is generally that policy is chiefly based on the pursuit, possession and application of power (see also [[power politics]]). However, some international relations realists, such as [[Kenneth Waltz]], have viewed state policy in terms of the pursuit of survival or security, rather than the pursuit of power for its own sake.

== History and branches ==
See [[political realism]] for branches and antecedents more relevant to contemporary diplomacy and the particular modern, international relations paradigm.
* [[Sun Tzu]], a Chinese military strategist who wrote ''[[The Art of War]]'' that foreshadowed elements of ''Realpolitik'' developed later.
* [[Thucydides]], a Greek historian who wrote the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' and is also cited as an intellectual forebearer of ''Realpolitik''.
* [[Chanakya]] (or Kautilya), an early Indian statesman and writer on the ''[[Arthashastra]]''.
* [[Ibn Khaldun]], an Arab Muslim historiographer and historian and one of the founding fathers of modern historiography author of [[Muqaddimah]] a universal history of time.
* [[Han Fei]], a Chinese scholar who theorised [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] (or Legism) and who served in the court of the King of Qin—later unifier of China ending the [[Warring States period]]. His theory centres on the Two Handles (about penalty and rewards as tools of governance). He theorised about a neutral, manipulative ruler who would act as [[head of state]] while secretly controlling the executive through his ministers—the ones to take real responsibility for any policy.
* [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], an Italian political philosopher who wrote ''[[Il Principe]]'' (''The Prince'') in which he held that the sole aim of a prince (politician) was to seek power, regardless of religious or ethical considerations. However, there is scholarly debate about whether his sentiment was genuine, or a satirical criticism of contemporary politics.
* [[Cardinal Richelieu]], a French statesman who destroyed domestic factionalism and guided France to a position of dominance in foreign affairs.
* [[Thomas Hobbes]], an English philosopher who wrote ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' in which he stated the [[state of nature]] was prone to a "war of all against all".
* [[Frederick the Great]], a Prussian monarch who transformed Prussia into a great European power through warfare and diplomacy.
* [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]], a French diplomat who guided France and Europe through a variety of political systems.
* [[Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich]], a Koblenz-born Austrian statesman opposed to political revolution.
* [[Carl von Clausewitz]], an 18–19th century Prussian general and military strategist who wrote ''[[On War]]'' (''Vom Kriege'').
* [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Camillo Benso of Cavour]], an Italian statesman who diplomatically managed to maneuver the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] to become a new great power in Europe, controlling a nearly united [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] that was five times as large as the Kingdom of Sardinia had been before he came to power.

[[File:Otto Fürst von Bismarck.JPG|thumb|Otto von Bismarck, a German statesman often associated with Realpolitik ]]
In the United States, the term is often analogous to [[power politics]] while in Germany ''Realpolitik'' has a somewhat less negative connotation, referring to realistic politics in opposition to idealistic (or unrealistic) politics. It is particularly associated with the era of 19th century [[nationalism]]. ''Realpolitik'' policies were employed in response to the failed [[revolutions of 1848]] as means to strengthen states and tighten social order.

The most famous German advocate of ''Realpolitik'' was [[Otto von Bismarck]], the first Chancellor (1862–1890) to [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Bismarck used ''Realpolitik'' in his quest to achieve Prussian dominance in Germany. He manipulated political issues such as the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]] and the Hohenzollern candidature to antagonize other countries and cause wars if necessary to attain his goals. Such policies are characteristic of Bismarck, demonstrating a pragmatic view of the "real" political world. Another example was his willingness to adopt some social policies of the socialists such as employee insurance and pensions; in doing so, he used small changes from the top down to avoid the possibility of major change from the bottom up. Likewise, Prussia's seemingly illogical move of not demanding territory from a defeated Austria, a move that later led to the [[unification of Germany]], is an oft-cited example of ''Realpolitik''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Adolf Hitler]]'s attempt to annex the predominantly German region of [[Czechoslovakia]] called the [[Sudetenland]] in 1938 may also be described as ''Realpolitik''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} At first, Hitler unsuccessfully demanded that Czech President [[Edvard Beneš]] hand over that region of the country. However, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] subsequently gave the Sudetenland to Hitler in the (ultimately unsuccessful) hope of preventing a war as codified in the [[Munich Agreement]]. With Britain a guarantor of Czech independence, Hitler knew that Beneš' opinion on the matter was immaterial if Chamberlain was prepared to give Hitler what he desired.

[[E. H. Carr]] was a liberal realist and [[left-wing]] British historian and [[international relations]] theorist who argued for realistic international policies versus utopian ones. Carr described realism as the acceptance that what exists is right and the belief that there is no reality or force outside history such as [[God]]. He argued that in realism there is no moral dimension; and that what is successful is right and what is unsuccessful is wrong. Carr was convinced that the [[Bolshevik]]s were destined to win the [[Russian Civil War]] and approved of the Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]]'s opposition to the anti-Bolshevik ideas of the War Secretary [[Winston Churchill]] under the grounds of ''Realpolitik''.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Robert William "Edward Hallett Carr, 1892–1982" pages 473–511 from ''Proceedings of the British Academy'', Volume 69, 1983 page 477.&lt;/ref&gt; In Carr's opinion, Churchill's support of the [[White movement|White Russian]] movement was folly as Russia was likely to be a great power once more under the leadership of the Bolsheviks.

=== United States ===
American ''Realpolitik'' began in the 1960s with the influence of Polish-American [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], later National Security Adviser to [[Jimmy Carter]]. Contrary to [[McCarthyism|McCarthy]]-era hostility (and [[John Foster Dulles]]' talk of the military "liberation" of the Eastern Bloc), Brzezinski proposed "peaceful engagement" with the Soviet Union while he was advising Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Brzezinski, uninterested in promoting anti-Soviet propaganda for the benefit of the United States, felt the United States would be more successful through frequent interactions with regimes and people under communist rule. Brzezinski knew the tough economic realities of those living in the Eastern Bloc, in particular the permanent shortage of goods; and that their attachment to the Soviet Union was born of historic necessity rather than common ideology. Brzezinski suggested enticing these countries economically and through educational and cultural exchanges that would appeal to intellectuals, followed by favoritism for regimes showing signs of liberalization or less reliance on Moscow. Through this approach, Brzezinski "offered a realistic, evolutionary alternative to empty political rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gati|first1=Charles|title=Zbig: The Strategy and Statecraft of Zbigniew Brzezinski|date=2013|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9781421409771|pages=23-24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GU4DAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT24|accessdate=1 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Kissinger]] has been credited with formally introducing the policy of ''Realpolitik'' to the [[White House]] as Secretary of State to [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Sholto|title=Time to Rethink Realpolitik|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/north-america/2009/02/obama-kissinger-world-russia|publisher=New Statesman|accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the policy meant dealing with other powerful nations in a practical manner rather than on the basis of political doctrine or ethics—for instance, Nixon's diplomacy with the [[People's Republic of China]] despite American opposition to [[communism]] and the previous doctrine of [[containment]]. Another example is Kissinger's use of [[shuttle diplomacy]] after the [[1973 Arab-Israeli war|1973 Arab–Israeli war]], where he persuaded the Israelis to withdraw partially from the Sinai in deference to the political realities created by the oil crisis.

Kissinger generally receives credit for introducing ''Realpolitik'' to American foreign policy. Kissinger himself said that he had never used the term and has said that it is used by both liberal and realist foreign policy thinkers to label, criticize and facilitate a choosing of sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Limits of Universalism|last = Kissinger|first = Henry|date = June 2012|journal = New Criterion|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kissinger had looked at what he implemented while serving as Secretary of State and United States Security Advisor not in the confines of making ''Realpolitik'' a standard policy, but within the terms of being a statesman. This political mindset can be seen in Kissinger’s book ''[[A World Restored]]'' and is pointed out by historian [[John Bew (historian)|John Bew]] in his book ''Realpolitik''. Kissinger goes on to say that the role of the statesman is "the ability to recognize the real relationship of forces and to make this knowledge serve his ends".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A World Restored: Metternich, Castlereagh and the Problems of Peace, 1812–1822|last = Kissinger|first = Henry|publisher = Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|year = 1999|isbn = |location = London|pages = 312–322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Realpolitik: A History|last = Bew|first = John|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2015|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, one can see how ''Realpolitik'' principles can influence American policy, but not as standard policy. The reach and influence of ''Realpolitik'' is found instead in pragmatic and flexible policy that changes to the needs of the situation. This type of policy making could be seen as recently as in the administration of [[Barack Obama]]. Bew makes note of this direction in the Obama administration when Obama's chief of staff [[Rahm Emanuel]] remarked in an article in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' that everyone wanted to break it down into contrasts of idealist and realist, but "if you had to put him in a category, he's probably more realpolitik, like [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] 41 [...] You’ve got to be cold-blooded about the self-interests of your nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Realpolitik: A History|last = Bew|first = John|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2015|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realpolitik is distinct from ideological politics in that it is not dictated by a fixed set of rules, but instead tends to be goal-oriented, limited only by practical exigencies. Since ''Realpolitik'' is ordered toward the most practical means of securing national interests, it can often entail compromising on ideological principles. For example, during the [[Cold War]] the United States often supported authoritarian regimes that were [[Human rights violations|human rights violators]] in order to theoretically secure the greater national interest of regional stability.&lt;ref name="DeConde Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|editors=DeConde, Alexander et al.|chapter=Dictatorships|title=Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy, Volume 1|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2001|isbn=9780684806570|page=499|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h7dG-pVarDAC&amp;pg=PA499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adams, Francis|title=Deepening democracy: global governance and political reform in Latin America|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2003|isbn=9780275979713|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXZCdsSlRLcC&amp;pg=PA31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McMahon, Robert J.|title=The limits of empire: the United States and Southeast Asia since World War II|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780231108805|page=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7a2WMyTc7YUC&amp;pg=PA205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grandin &amp; Joseph"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grandin &amp; Joseph|first=Greg &amp; Gilbert|title=A Century of Revolution|year=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|pages=397–414}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the Cold War, this practice continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chick|first1=Kristen|title=US resumes arms sales to Bahrain.

Most recently, former ambassador [[Dennis Ross]] advocated this approach to foreign policy in his 2007 book ''Statecraft: And How to Restore America's Standing in the World''. For the purposes of contrast and speaking in [[ideal type]]s, political [[ideologue]]s would tend to favor principle over other considerations. Such individuals or groups can reject compromises which they see as the abandonment of their ideals and so may sacrifice political gain in favor of adhering to principles they believe to be constitutive of long-term goals.

{{Chinese Legalism}}
China has a "realistic" tradition dating back thousands of years. Often referred to as [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Chinese Legalism]], the spirit of its content may be most readily recognized by Western viewers through one of its kindred, ''[[The Art of War]]''.&lt;ref name="Wealth and Power"&gt;Wealth and Power. Orville Schell&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese administrative organization influenced Western administrative practices not later than the 12th century, playing a significant role in the development of the modern state, including use of the examination.&lt;ref name="Creel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Creel|first1=Herrlee G.|title=Shen Pu-Hai: A Secular Philosopher of Administration|journal=Journal of Chinese Philosophy|date=March 1974|volume=1|issue=2|pages=119–136|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6253.1974.tb00644.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van der Sprenkel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins of Statecraft in China"&gt;Origins of Statecraft in China&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sjsu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/legalism.htm|title=Legalism and the Legalists of Ancient China|work=sjsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (771–476/403 BC), a trend of "realistic" reformers were taken on to advance the material interest of their respective [[Seven Warring States|states]], with the [[Qin state]] founding the first Chinese Empire, [[Qin dynasty]] in 221 BCE, ending China's [[Warring States period]]. The political theory developed during the era, including that of [[Confucianism]] would influence every dynasty thereafter.

Those termed Legalist are more purely "Realpolitikal"&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Civilization and Realpolitik'', by Prasenjit Duara, India International Centre Quarterly, Vol. 36, No. 3/4, INDIACHINA Neighbours Strangers (WINTER 2009 SPRING 2010), pp. 20-33.&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to Confucianism and include non-legal [[Shen Pu-hai]] derived political technique, which charges the ruler engage in [[Wu wei|passive observation]] to determine facts rather than take on too much himself. [[Sinologist]] [[Herrlee G. Creel]] writes: "If one wishes to exaggerate, it would no doubt be possible to translate (foundational Realist) Shen Buhai's term Shu, or [[Scientific technique|technique]], as '[[Scientific method|science]]', and argue that Pu-hai was the first political scientist," though Creel does "not care to go this far".&lt;ref name="Creel"/&gt;

During the Spring and Autumn period,&lt;ref name="Origins of Statecraft in China"/&gt; the prevalent philosophy had dictated war as a gentleman's activity; military commanders were instructed to respect what they perceived to be Heaven's laws in battle.&lt;ref name="morton26"&gt;Morton 1995, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when [[Duke Xiang of Song]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Not to be confused with any Duke of the [[Song dynasty]] of a later period.&lt;/ref&gt; was at war with the state of Chu during the Warring States period, he declined an opportunity to attack the enemy force (commanded by Zhu) while they were crossing a river.

The Qin disregarded this military tradition, taking advantage of their enemy's weaknesses.

{{over-quotation|section|date=February 2018}}
{{quote|text=The PAP government has taken pains to present its principles of meritocracy and pragmatism as a viable alternative to liberal democracy and multi-party competition, sometimes by drawing from a specious notion of Confucian values and Asian culture to construct ideological bulwarks—like "Asian democracy"—against the criticisms of the so-called liberal West. By crediting meritocracy and pragmatism for creating the right conditions for economic success, the PAP government has been able not only to justify its (liberal) democratic deficit, but also to produce ideological resources and a structure of authorization for the maintenance of a one-party dominant regime. In "pragmatic" terms, Singapore's considerable economic success is justification enough for its authoritarian means.|sign=Kenneth Paul Tan|source="The Ideology of Pragmatism: Neo-liberal Globalisation and Political Authoritarianism in Singapore"&lt;ref name="Pragmatism 2012"/&gt;}}
According to Kenneth Paul Tan of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, "Chua Beng Huat (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chua|first1=Beng-Huat|title=Communitarian ideology and democracy in Singapore|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780415120548|edition=Repr. 1996.}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the rhetoric of pragmatism in Singapore is ideological and hegemonic in nature, adopted and disseminated in the public sphere by the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) government and institutionalized throughout the state in all its administrative, planning and policy-making functions. It is suggested that by doggedly describing itself as pragmatic, the Singapore state is actually disguising its ideological work and political nature through an assertion of the absence of ideology and politics. Chan Heng Chee (1975) earlier described Singapore as a depoliticized "administrative state", where ideology and politics had triumphantly been replaced by rational and scientific modes of public administration".&lt;ref name="Pragmatism 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|title=The Ideology of Pragmatism: Neo-liberal Globalisation and Political Authoritarianism in Singapore|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|date=February 2012|volume=42|issue=1|pages=67–92|doi=10.1080/00472336.2012.634644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Red Peters''''' (a pseudonym for Boston-area comedian '''Douglas Stevens'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=McNulty|first=Michael|title=A Custom Music Shop, Plus More...|magazine=Video Systems Magazine|page=S15|date= September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a musician and songwriter who has made five CDs.  He is the host of ''The Red Peters Comedy Music Hour'' on [[Sirius XM]], and a frequent guest on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]].''

==Early career==
Stevens attended [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in Boston from 1968–1971, majoring in film.  He was one of the original students of The Studio For Interrelated Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handsomebrothers.com/bios/stevens.html|title=Douglas Stevens|publisher=Handsome Brothers|accessdate=July 22, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911141047/http://www.handsomebrothers.com/bios/stevens.html|archivedate=September 11, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevens left art school in late 1971 to go on the road with his first music group, Gross National Productions (or "GNP") as lead vocalist under the stage name "Matt Maverick."&lt;ref name=NEMO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nemo-newengland.blogspot.com/2011/06/gross-national-productions.html|title=Gross National Productions|publisher= NEMO New England |date=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; GNP recorded their debut album, "P Flaps and Low Blows" on Metromedia Records in 1972; the album was produced by George "Shadow" Morton and John Linde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofrecording.com/George_Shadow_Morton.html|title=George "Shadow" Morton|publisher= History of Recording|accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Off the album, the band toured nationally, both headlining as well as opening for major acts such as [[Lee Michaels]], [[Tommy James]], [[Sha Na Na]], [[Badfinger]], [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]], [[Jeremy Steig]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[The Mahavishnu Orchestra]], and [[Frank Zappa]] and [[The Mothers of Invention]].&lt;ref name=NEMO/&gt;

Following GNP's breakup, Stevens (under the name "Red Stevens") co-wrote and directed the rock comedy musical theater production ''Rockfights – Rich Amusement'', which played at the Overland Theater in Boston in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/redpeters/4725481372/|title=The Overland Theater|publisher=Red Peters|date=March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Music===
In 1984, the song "Blow Me (You Hardly Even Know Me)" was the first single ever released by Stevens as "Red Peters," as a 45rpm single. He co-wrote the song with Ed Grenga (a.k.a. "Babe Marino"), who also gave Stevens the stage name "Red Peters."  As Peters told Outer Shell Magazine, "My music director, Babe Marino, and I were messing around with a big band arrangement one day and the words just flowed out. We brought the scratch recording to a party that night and people went shithouse for it. We went on to formally record it with his orchestra along with the Alan Pinchloaf Singers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harper|first=Roy|title=Red Peters – "Ol' Blue Balls"|journal=Outer Shell|volume= 2|issue= 17|date=July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Peters released "How's Your Whole... Family?" as a second single.  This led to a full-length release, produced by Grenga, in 1995 for Ugly Sisters Records, ''I Laughed... I Cried... I Fudged My Undies!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/i-laughedi-criedi-fudged-my-undies-mw0000646322|title=I Laughed...I Cried...I Fudged My Undies|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]|accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nationwide radio tour followed, including the [[Mancow Muller]] show, the [[Dr. Demento]] radio show, and eventually [[Howard Stern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Red Pleads For Mercy|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page=109|date=January 27, 1996|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his first appearance on Stern's show in 1996, he sang "A Ballad of a Dog Named Stains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redpeters.com/news/deansplanet/|title=Red Peters|publisher=deansplanet.com|date=December 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Peters released his 2nd full-length album, "''Ol' Blue Balls Is Back!''" on Ball Bag Records. It was again produced by Grenga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/ol-blue-balls-is-back-mw0000258813|title=Ol' Blue Balls Is Back|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]|accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2003, Peters and Ball Bag Records signed an exclusive distribution deal with [[Oglio Records|Oglio]] Entertainment Group, and his music is distributed by Universal Fontana.  This led to two single releases, "I Can't Say These Things" in 2005, and "When I Jerkoff, I Think of You" in 2006.  ''"The Best of the Red Peters Comedy Music Hour, Vol. #1"'', a compilation album of various artists, was the first full-length release with Oglio in 2007.&lt;ref name=Catalog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglio.com/red-peters|title=Red Peters – Catalog|publisher=[[Oglio Records]]|accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This album consisted of songs and artists featured on his Sirius Howard 101 radio show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/#/album/red-peters/the-best-of-the-red-peters-comedy-music/1079544|title=The Best of the Red Peters Comedy Music Hour, Vol. 1 – Red Peters|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Peters released ''It's A Red Peters Christmas! Vol. 1'', a collection of holiday songs from guests that appeared on his Red Peters Comedy Music Hour holiday radio programs on Sirius XM Howard 101, once again performed by various artists.  In 2010, another compilation from his radio show, called ''Red Peters Presents The Summer Song Sizzler'', was released.&lt;ref name=Catalog/&gt;

In October 2010, Peters and comic [[Margaret Cho]] recorded a cover of the Dick Shreve song, "The Christmas Gift (Just A Little Christmas Blow Job)"  when Cho was in Boston on her "Cho Dependent" national tour, performing at the Wilbur Theater. The song was released as a single on Oglio Records in November 2010.&lt;ref name=Catalog/&gt;

===Audio production===
In 1976, Stevens founded the music production company Handsome Brothers Music Service with fellow GNP band member Tom Dempsey.  The company specializes in commercial music production for television, radio, corporate videos, advertising, and motion pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handsomebrothers.com/|title=Handsome Brothers Music Service|publisher=Handsome Brothers Music Service|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composer Ed Grenga became a business partner in 1984; besides corporate work, Grenga has produced all of Peters' albums and scored numerous feature films as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1406695/|title=Ed Grenga|publisher=[[IMDB]]|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2009 baseball season, Grenga and Stevens created pregame, in-game and post-game music for [[NESN]]'s broadcasts of [[Boston Red Sox]] games.  The music debuted on Opening Day in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bostonherald.com/sports/baseball/red_sox/view/2009_04_05_Work_is_a_ball_for_writers_of_NESN_Red_Sox_game_songs|title=Work is a ball for writers of NESN Red Sox game songs|author=Paul Restuccia|publisher=[[Boston Herald]]|date=April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio show===
In 2005, Peters started a Sirius Satellite Radio show called ''The Red Peters Comedy Music Hour'' on Howard Stern's "Howard 101" channel, as a weekly broadcast.  The first show aired November 18, 2005.  The show is described as "uncensored songs, oddities, taboo subjects and the forbidden spoken word."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.siriusxm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=183533|title=Howard Stern Makes History!|publisher=[[Sirius XM]]|date=January 9, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130202130639/http://investor.siriusxm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=183533|archivedate=February 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Peters' show went to a schedule of 8 one-hour specials a year, primarily on holiday weekends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ogliocomedy.com/tag/red-peters-comedy-music-hour/|title=Red Peters Comedy Music Hour|publisher=[[Oglio Records]]|accessdate=July 23, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824185751/http://ogliocomedy.com/tag/red-peters-comedy-music-hour/|archivedate=August 24, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television, movies, and theater===
In 1997, Peters appeared on Stern's radio show, and shortly thereafter on his CBS late night television show, ''[[The Howard Stern Radio Show]]''.  He was featured in a live segment from the radio show, and in music video footage of his song, "The Ballad of a Dog Named Stains".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By8cS75U8Ow|title=Red Peters- Howard Stern CBS Show Appearance|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peters appeared in the movie ''Johnny Slade's Greatest Hits'' (''Meet The Mobsters'') in 2005.  Handsome Brothers partner Grenga produced the songs and scored the film.  Peters' "Blow Me (You Hardly Even Know Me)" was featured in the film's opening scenes, and actor John Fiore sang an arrangement of Peters' song, "The First Time I Met You". Peters had a role in the film, playing himself, as a wise cracking stand-up comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389053/|title=Johnny Slade's Greatest Hits|publisher=[[IMDB]]|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Peters and singer/songwriter Gregory Roman, star of the short film ''Titler'' that won an Honorable Mention at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0224263/|title=Awards for Titler|publisher=[[IMDB]]|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-wrote and produced the Nu-vaudeville production, ''Oddvile''.  It was a 2-hour show, featuring a variety of music, comedy, and novelty acts.  It premiered June 7, 2008, at Boston's Cutler Majestic Theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2008/06/06/red_peters_steps_out_of_shadows_with_oddville|title=Red Peters steps out of shadows with 'Oddville'|author=Nick A. Zaino III|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident with President Obama==
In August 2011, while vacationing on Martha's Vineyard, Peters is reported to have accidentally farted in front of [[Barack Obama]].  "Mr. Obama was forced from the fiction aisle to the self-help section until the Secret Service deemed the area was clear," Peters told the ''Boston Herald''. "They were polite but not amused. The young daughter (Sasha) was blocking her nose. I was so embarrassed."  The President's security detail then escorted Peters from the bookstore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bostonherald.com/track/inside_track/view/2011_0825wheres_obamacare_when_you_need_it|title=Where's Obamacare when you need it?|author=Gayle Fee and Luara Raposa with Megan Johnson|work=[[Boston Herald]]|date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Triana Park''' ({{lang-lv|Triānas Parks}}) is a Latvian group consisting of vocalist Agnese Rakovska, guitarist Artūrs Strautiņš, drummer Edgars Viļums and bassist Kristaps Ērglis.

Triana Park is one of the most extravagant acts from their homeland – Latvia. Their sound is unique and eclectic as it combines pop and electronic with hints of hip-hop and some bold rock vibes. The band was founded in 2008 by Agnese Rakovska, who is also the leader of the band. She is backed up by Arturs Strautins (guitar), Edgars Vilums (drums) and Kristaps Erglis (bass). To date they've released two records; their debut, EnterTainment, in 2010 and an EP, Triana Park, in 2014.
The group have played almost every relevant festival in Latvia and they've done some pretty impressive work abroad as well, taking stage at SXSW (USA), Reeperbahn (Germany), Eurosonic Noordeslag (The Netherlands), Waves Bratislava (Slovakia), Waves Vienna (Austria), and the Siirt Gapgenc festival (Turkey). Triana Park are known for their explosive live performances, always filled with energy.

They represented [[Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017]] with their song "[[Line (song)|Line]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eurovoix.com/2017/02/26/latvia-triana-park-kyiv/|title=Latvia: Triana Park to Kyiv|date=26 February 2017|publisher=Eurovoix|website=eurovoix.com|last=Herbert|first=Emily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kodis"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kodis|first1=Miroslavs|title=Miroslavs Kodis: «Triānas parka» uzvara «Supernovā» izraisījusi sajūsmas vilni|url=http://www.lsm.lv/lv/raksts/arpus-etera/miroslavs-kodis-trianas-parka-uzvara-supernova-izraisijusi-sajusmas-vilni.a225767/|accessdate=14 March 2017|publisher=LSM.lv|date=27 February 2017|language=lv}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also previously attempted to represent the nation in [[Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], [[Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]], [[Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]], [[Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]], and [[Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/10733 |title=Latvia decided: The Pirates to Eurovision |publisher=ESCtoday.com |date=2008-03-01 |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5256|title=Intars Busulis wins Eirodziesma 2009|last=Calleja Bayliss|first=Marc|date=2009-02-28|publisher=''Oikotimes''|accessdate=2017-02-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206022820/http://oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5256|archivedate=2010-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14885|title=LTV reveals 10 Eirodziesma finalists|last=Hondal|first=Victor|date=2010-01-22|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=8263&amp;_t=LTV+reveals+Latvian+final+ten|title=LTV reveals Latvian final ten|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|date=2010-01-22|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mercereau"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mercereau|first1=Damien|title=Eurovision 2017 : Triana Park, le coup de folie de la Lettonie|url=http://tvmag.lefigaro.fr/programme-tv/eurovision-2017-triana-park-le-coup-de-folie-de-la-lettonie_e4236838-04ba-11e7-aad0-d9371b2c396c/|accessdate=15 March 2017|publisher=[[Le Figaro]]|date=9 March 2017|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
The group was formed by Agnese Rakovska and her father Aivars Rakovski, with them being joined by Edgars Viļums and eventually also by Kristaps Ērglis. They attempted to represent Latvia in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, failing to win the ''[[Eirodziesma]]''. In 2011, their song "Upside Down" qualified for the final of the preselection, but the band pulled out as Rakovski fell ill. Triana Park's debut studio album, ''EnterTainment'', was released in 2010. A follow-up eponymous extended play was made available for purchase in August 2014, including the lead single "Iron Blue".

The band attempted to represent Latvia for a sixth time in 2017 with "[[Line (song)|Line]]" and were successful, receiving 51.56% of the public vote and winning the right to perform for Latvia at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2017]]. It was eventually announced that they would take part in the first semi final on 9 May 2017 at the [[International Exhibition Centre]] in [[Kiev]], Ukraine as the closing act. In Kiev, they failed to qualify for the final, finishing last out of 18 countries in the first semi final with 21 points. 

The band released their second album, Alive on 18 April 2018. It is made up of 13 songs including the Eurovision entry, Line.

She was launched on 29 March 1992 and commissioned on 2 April 1993.  Homeported at [[Odessa]] since March 2014, she is the [[flagship]] of the [[Ukrainian Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/kozhara-hetman-sahaidachny-frigate-to-join-natos-anti-piracy-operation/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130917123531/http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/kozhara-hetman-sahaidachny-frigate-to-join-natos-anti-piracy-operation/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 September 2013 |title=Kozhara: Hetman Sahaidachny frigate to join NATO’s anti-piracy operation |work=[[Interfax-Ukraine]] |date=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history==
Built at the [[Zalyv Shipbuilding yard]], the ship was intended to be used by the [[Soviet Border Troops]] as ''Kirov''. However, on 4 July 1993, the newly named (after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]]) ''Hetman Sahaydachniy'' raised the flag of the [[Ukrainian Navy]].&lt;ref name=KS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svitlytsia.crimea.ua/index.php?section=article&amp;artID=4052 |publisher=Кримська Свiтлиця |last= Armashevska |first=Alain |script-title=uk:Гетьман Сагайдачний: корабель та людина |date=11 August 2006 |accessdate=8 February 2015|language=Ukrainian }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was given the identification number of U130.

In 1994, ''Hetman Sahaydachniy'' set sail for [[France]] to take part in the 50th anniversary commemorations of the [[Normandy landings|Allied invasion of Normandy]].

In 1995, ''Hetman Sahaydachniy'' visited [[Abu Dhabi]] during the "[[International Defence Exhibition|Idex-95]]" exhibitions. The frigate was scheduled to visit [[Norfolk, Virginia]] in the United States with ''Kostiantyn Olshansky''. ''Olshansky'' visited but for unknown reasons the ''Sahaydachniy'' did not.

The vessel has also visited ports in [[Algeria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Egypt]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Israel]], [[Portugal]], [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]].

Between November 2006 and November 2007, she underwent major repairs in [[Mykolaiv]] at a cost of 15 million [[hryvnia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novosti-n.mk.ua/news/read/?id=3192 |script-title=ru:Отремонтированный фрегат «Гетьман Сагайдачний» отправился в Севастополь.

In 2008, ''Hetman Sahaydachniy'' took part in "[[Operation Active Endeavour]]" in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

In February 2013, it was announced that she would be taking part in [[NATO]]'s "[[Operation Ocean Shield]]", an anti-piracy campaign off the [[Horn of Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/military_news/20130222/179631923.html|title=Ukraine Joins NATO's Counter-Piracy Operation|first=John|last=Thys|work=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=22 February 2013|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hetman Sahaydachniy'' joined the Naval Force of the European Union ([[EUNAVFOR]]) in early January 2014 for anti-piracy operations. As she refueled in [[Greece]], while [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian forces seized control of Crimea]], Russian Senator [[Igor Morozov (politician)|Igor Morozov]] claimed on 1 March 2014 that the ship's crew had defected to Russia and raised the Russian flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rt.com/news/ukraine-navy-flaghsip-protest-389/|title=Ukrainian Navy flagship takes Russia’s side|work=RT|date=1 March 2014|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, independent news organizations reported that the ship was still flying the Ukrainian flag in port in [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304815004579415310363248616?KEYWORDS=Ukraine&amp;mg=reno64-wsj|title=Ukraine Ousts Top Naval Officer After He Joins Separatists|first=Alexander|last=Kolyandr|work=Wall Street Journal |date=2 March 2014|accessdate=8 February 2015}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commander of the ship confirmed that the crew had never defected to the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mil.gov.ua/index.php?lang=en&amp;part=news&amp;sub=read&amp;id=32772|title=News|publisher=Mil.gov.ua|date=2014-03-02|accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She arrived in [[Odessa]] under the Ukrainian flag on 5 March.

'''Verrückt''' ([[German language|German]] for ''crazy'' or ''insane'') was a water slide at the [[Schlitterbahn Kansas City]] water park.
