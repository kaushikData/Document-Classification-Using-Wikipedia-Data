[[Image:Graham's_Hierarchy_of_Disagreement-en.svg|thumb|right|375px|[[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]]'s Hierarchy of Disagreement lists ad hominem as the second lowest type of argument in a disagreement.]]

However, its original meaning was an argument "calculated to appeal to the person addressed more than to impartial reason".&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, H. W. (1926), ''A Dictionary of Modern English Usage'' (under ''Technical Terms'')&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallacious ''ad hominem'' reasoning is categorized  among [[informal fallacy|informal fallacies]],&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Doug Walton|Walton, Douglas]] |title=Informal Logic: A Pragmatic Approach |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowell|first1=Tracy|last2=Kemp|first2=Gary|title=Critical Thinking: A Concise Guide|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=0-415-47183-4|pages=210–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Irving M.|last=Copi|title=Informal Logic|isbn=0-02-324940-4|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|pages=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; more precisely as a [[genetic fallacy]], a subcategory of [[fallacies of irrelevance]].

== Types ==
{{See also|List of fallacies}}

===''Tu quoque''===
{{Main|Tu quoque}}
''Ad hominem tu quoque'' (literally: "You also") refers to a claim that the source making the argument has spoken or acted in a way inconsistent with the argument. In particular, if Source A criticizes the actions of Source B, a ''tu quoque'' response is that Source A has acted in the same way. This argument is invalid because it does not disprove the premise; if the premise is true then Source A may be a [[hypocrite]], but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective. Indeed, Source A may be in a position to provide personal testimony to support the argument.

For example, a father may tell his son not to start smoking as he will regret it when he is older, and the son may point out that his father is or was a smoker. This does not alter the fact that his son may regret smoking when he is older.

===Circumstantial===
{{Main|Bulverism}}
''Circumstantial ad hominem'' points out that someone is in circumstances such that they are disposed to take a particular position. It constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. This is fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid; this overlaps with the [[genetic fallacy]] (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source).&lt;ref name="Walton (1998) p18-21"&gt;{{cite book |last=Walton |first=Douglas |title=Ad Hominem Arguments |publisher=University of Alabama Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-8173-0922-5 |pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumstantial fallacy does not apply where the source is taking a position by using a logical argument based solely on premises that are generally accepted. Where the source seeks to convince an audience of the truth of a premise by a claim of authority or by personal observation, observation of their circumstances may reduce the evidentiary weight of the claims, sometimes to zero.&lt;ref name="Fallacy Files"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html |title=Argumentum ad Hominem |accessdate=2007-09-10 |work=Fallacy Files |last=Curtis |first=Gary N.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070920193815/http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html| archivedate= 20 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Examples''':

# [[Mandy Rice-Davies]]'s famous testimony during the [[Profumo Affair]], "He would [say that], wouldn't he?", is an example of a valid circumstantial argument. Her point was that a man in a prominent position, accused of an affair with a [[callgirl]], would deny the claim whether it was true or false.  His denial, in itself, provides little evidence against the claim of an affair.

However, this argument is valid only insofar as it devalues the denial; it does ''not'' strengthen the original claim.  To construe invalid evidence of the denial as valid evidence of the original claim is fallacious (on several different bases, including that of ''argumentum ad hominem'' and ''appeal to emotions''); however likely the man in question would be to deny an affair that did in fact happen, he is even more likely to deny an affair that never happened. (For example, inferring guilt from a denial{{snd}}or, less starkly, excessive devaluation of a denial{{snd}}is a very common feature in [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], [[witch-hunt]]s, [[show trials]], [[struggle sessions]], and other coercive circumstances in which the person targeted is presumed guilty.)

# Glassner suggests that Bennett is somehow unqualified to criticize rap music because of positions Bennett has taken on other issues. However wrong Bennett may or may not have been on other issues, that does not mean that his criticisms of rap were mistaken.&lt;ref name="Fallacy Files"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html |title=Argumentum ad Hominem |accessdate=2007-09-10 |work=Fallacy Files |last=Curtis |first=Gary N.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070920193815/http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html| archivedate= 20 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guilt by association===
{{Main|Association fallacy}}
Guilt by association can sometimes also be a type of ''ad hominem'' fallacy if the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.&lt;ref name="Walton (1998) p18-21"/&gt;

This form of the argument is as follows:
# Source S makes claim C.
# Group G, which is currently viewed negatively by the recipient, also makes claim C.
# Therefore, source S is viewed by the recipient of the claim as associated to the group G and inherits how negatively viewed it is.

An example of this fallacy could be "My opponent for office just received an endorsement from the Puppy Haters Association. Is that the sort of person you would want to vote for?"

== Non-fallacious reasoning ==
When a statement is challenged by making an ''ad hominem'' attack on its author, it is important to draw a distinction between whether the statement in question was ''an argument'' or ''a statement of fact'' (''testimony''). In the latter case the issues of the credibility of the person making the statement may be crucial.&lt;ref name="Fallacy Files"/&gt;

== Criticism as a fallacy ==

[[Doug Walton]],  Canadian academic and author, has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning is not always fallacious, and that in some instances, questions of personal conduct, character, motives, etc., are legitimate and relevant to the issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walton, Douglas |title=Informal Logic: A Pragmatic Approach |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; as when it directly involves hypocrisy, or actions contradicting the subject's words.

The philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning (discussing facts about the speaker or author relative to the value of his statements) is essential to understanding certain moral issues due to the connection between individual persons and morality (or moral claims), and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the [[apodicticity|apodictic]] reasoning (involving facts beyond dispute or clearly established) of philosophical naturalism.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Charles Taylor (philosopher) |last=Taylor |first=Charles |title=Philosophical Arguments |year=1995 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674664760 |pages=34–60 |url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=iqtLAsIBZ2sC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=explanation+and+practical+reason+charles+taylor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NULkg3WL_-&amp;sig=BaEwQ_OXdRBysmVeQVkM4uKJ2s8&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Explanation and Practical Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}
'''Applied anthropology''' refers to the application of the method and theory of [[anthropology]] to the analysis and solution of practical problems. In ''Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application'', Kedia and Van Willigen define the process as a "complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kedia, Satish|first=and Willigen J. Van|title=Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application|year=2005|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn|pages=16, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, applied anthropology is the praxis-based side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and [[activism]] within the participating [[community]].

==Spanning academic disciplines==
The [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) website describes anthropology as a focus on "the study of humans, past and present. To understand the full sweep and complexity of cultures across all of human history, anthropology draws and builds upon knowledge from the social and biological sciences as well as the humanities and physical sciences." Thus, the field is divided into four subareas: [[sociocultural anthropology]], [[Biological anthropology|biological (or physical) anthropology]], [[archaeology]], and [[linguistic anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Anthropological Association|title=What is Anthropology?|url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because a central tenet of the anthropological field is the application of shared knowledge and research about humans across the world, an anthropologist who specializes in any of these areas and enacts research into direct action and/or policy can be deemed an "applied anthropologist". Indeed, some practical problems may invoke all sub-disciplines. For example, a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] community development program may involve archaeological research to determine legitimacy of water rights claims, ethnography to assess the current and historical cultural characteristics of the community, linguistics to restore language competence among inhabitants, medical anthropology to determine the causality of dietary deficiency diseases, etc.

==Professional engagement==
Applied anthropologists often work for nonacademic clients, such as [[government]]s, development agencies, [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), [[Tribe|tribal]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] associations, [[advocacy group]]s, social-service and educational agencies, and businesses. It is also not uncommon for an anthropologist to initiate activist work surrounding his or her own area of study; frequently, sociocultural anthropological studies begin as mere research inquiries that blossom into community advocacy projects, and even new specialized NGOs.

Applied anthropologist methodology includes, but is not limited to, [[ethnography]], [[participant observation]], [[snowball sampling|snowballing]], interviews, and [[focus group]]s. They also use [[textual analysis]], surveying, [[archival research]], and other empirical methods to inform policy or to market products.

==Problems and criticisms==
The process of conducting anthropological research and then applying knowledge in attempts to ameliorate the lives of research participants can be problematic, and is often laced with elements of [[Orientalism]] and/or [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Said|first=Edward W.|title=Orientalism|year=1994|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kedia and Van Willigen describe the moral dilemma embedded in this work: "The ethical requirements of applied anthropology are especially challenging since the practitioner must negotiate an intricate balance between the interests of the clients who commission the work, and those of the community being studied." The authors continue by stating that this negotiation leads to issues of privacy, ownership, and the implications and purposes of the study being produced (p.&amp;nbsp;16). 

Although guidelines for ethicalities of applied anthropology are put forth by major anthropological organizations—including the American Anthropological Association (AAA), the [[Society for Applied Anthropology]] (SFAA), and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA)—it is increasingly difficult to ensure that the high volume of worldwide anthropologists proceed with their research in ways that are both culturally relative and sensitive to community needs. Kedia and Van Willigen describe the myriad roles an applied anthropologist must play as effective resource for communities in need; a researcher must be an advocate, cultural "broker", evaluator, policy researcher, public participation specialist, and research analyst. 

The multinational phenomenon of [[female genital cutting]] (FGC) exemplifies the necessity for an anthropologist to account for relative cultural contexts: "The work of scholars who stress the fundamental importance of offering perspectives on cultural factors that promote the practice of female genital cutting has brought the debate surrounding cultural relativism into sharp focus. Greunbaum (1996) notes that analyses that ''do'' offer [[Emic and etic|emic]] interpretations and cultural contextualizations are often criticized as bordering on advocacy for the practice" [emphasis in original].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shell-Duncan, Bettina|first=and Ylva Hernlund|title=Female "circumcision" in Africa: Culture, Controversy, and Change|year=2000|publisher=Lynne Rienner|location=Boulder|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these instances, it is imperative that an anthropologist not cloud his or her own preconceived notions about health and gender relations in an attempt to "remedy" a complex social issue.

==Debates about objectivity in anthropology==
The field of anthropology is also fraught with debate surrounding accurate and effective approaches to conducting research. More specifically, there is continued debate about the essentiality of [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] in anthropological fieldwork. Some [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] scholars contend that it is impossible to remove one's own preconceived cultural notions from one's work. In this line of thought, it is more productive to recognize that anthropologists are themselves culturally programmed observers, and must always be wary of biases that influence information they receive. In contrast, the [[Positivism|positivist]] approach to anthropology emphasizes the necessity for 
an objective, regimented, and scientific approach to anthropological research.

==Scholarly works and organizations==
The premiere journal of applied anthropology in the United States is called ''[[Human Organization]]'', published by the Society for Applied Anthropology. In the UK, the main journal for applied anthropology is called ''[[Anthropology in Action]]''.

Under the directorship of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute]], Jonathan Benthall (author of ''The Best of Anthropology Today'') created the annual [[Lucy Mair]] Medal of Applied Anthropology. This recognizes excellence in using anthropology "for the relief of poverty or distress, or for the active recognition of human dignity".

The Association of Social Anthropologists (ASA) has a network of Applied Anthropologists known as "Apply". Within the [[European Association of Social Anthropologists]] (EASA), there is the [http://www.applied-anthropology.com/ Applied Anthropology Network], which annually organises the international symposium Why the World Needs Anthropologists. Theme of the first symposium was New Fields for Applied Anthropology in Europe (Amsterdam, 2013), of the second Coming Out of the Ivory Tower (Padua, 2014), of the third Burning Issues of Our Hot Planet (Ljubljana, 2015), of the fourth Humanise IT (Tartu, 2016), of the fifth Powering the Planet (Durham, 2017), and of the sixth Designing the Future (Lisbon, 2018). Within the EASA [[Medical anthropology|Medical Anthropology]] Network, there is also an applied anthropology special interest group.

There are three primary groups based out of the US that are founded on the application of anthropology with acute attention to ethics and social implications: American Anthropological Association (AAA), Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA), and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA).

'''Australia: Boom to Bust''' is a 2014 book by the economist Lindsay David. David was a student of the world's most prestigious business school [[International Institute for Management Development]] in [[Lausanne, Switzerland]]

==Synopsis==
The book argues Australia is facing an unprecedented housing and credit bubble, by comparing exposure of Australian banks to extraordinary levels of debt and the relatively non-diverse Australian economy with the conditions leading to other financial crashes, such as the [[Global financial crisis]] and the [[Lost Two Decades]] in [[Japan]].
David points out that housing prices in Sydney are higher than in [[London]], [[Tokyo]], [[Geneva]] or [[New York City]], in some cases significantly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/australias-housing-bubble-is-real-and-banks-are-to-blame-says-author-20140828-109ahx.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
His book was reviewed in the ''[[Australian Financial Review]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afr.com/real-estate/residential/the-shires-property-prophet-of-doom-20140828-jcz1t&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Macro Business''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2014/08/australias-boom-to-bust/&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others.

'''Chunchucmil''' was once a large, sprawling [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya city]] located in the western part of what is now the state of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], [[Mexico]].

Although the famous explorer and author [[John Lloyd Stephens]] traveled within a few kilometers of Chunchucmil during his historic journey across the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] (he even met with the owner of the nearby [[hacienda]]s),&lt;ref&gt;Stephens 1962 (1842).&lt;/ref&gt; the archaeological site went relatively unnoticed by [[Mayanist|Maya scholars]] for more than a century because virtually no monuments ([[stelae]]) or other grand sculptures have been found there.  The lack of royal monuments, combined with other archaeological data, may indicate that Chunchucmil was not a city ruled by a single divine king, as most other [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[polity|polities]].  Instead, it may have been a commercial center, organized by various lineages and focused upon funneling goods between regions—such as the trade between the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico|Gulf of Mexico]] and the interior of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]].

Chunchucmil was most populous in the Middle Classical Period (400-650 AD),

==Site characteristics==

===Location===
[[File:Poniente Peninsula Yucatan.jpg|thumb|300px|Thematic map of major archaeological sites and ecological zones related to Chunchucmil]]The site center is located ca. 27&amp;nbsp;km (16.8&amp;nbsp;mi) inland from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and approximately halfway between the coast and the next largest [[archaeological site]] of [[Oxkintok]].  It was named in the late 1970s after the nearest modern settlement (the [[Hacienda]] and [[village]] of Chunchucmil), however the archaeological site is so large that it extends onto the [[ejido]] lands of at least five modern communities: Chunchucmil, Kochol, San Mateo, Coahuila and Halachó.  The majority of the ancient Maya site is located within the [[municipality of Maxcanú]], however a portion of it is situated on land pertaining to the [[municipality of Halachó]].

===Environment and ecology===
[[File:Celestún salinas.jpg|thumb|left|Salt evaporation ponds of Celestún in the Yucatan Peninsula]]The site of Chunchucmil is located on a narrow band of [[semi-arid]] terrain that parallels portions of the western and northern coastlines in [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] and [[Campeche]].  This particular environmental zone is considered the driest in all of the Maya area,&lt;ref&gt;Luzzadder-Beach 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dahlin et al. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; with less than 800&amp;nbsp;mm (31.5&amp;nbsp;in) of annual rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;Beach 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Compounding these harsh conditions, nearly fifty percent of the surface around Chunchucmil is exposed [[limestone]] [[bedrock]].  Even when soils are encountered, they are rarely more than a few centimeters in depth.  Vegetation in this region is generally considered [[Scrubland|scrub forest]] dominated by [[acacia]] and other drought-resistant species (similar to the European [[heathland]]).  One of the mysteries surrounding Chunchucmil is how such a large city could have sustained itself in one of the poorest regions for agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Vlcek et al. 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farrell et al. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the ancient city was situated at the edge of this semi-arid ecological zone, exactly where the dry Yucatecan plains dip and fracture into vast [[wetland]]s (see map).  Immediately to the west of Chunchucmil are found the seasonally inundated [[savanna]]s, fresh water ''petenes'' (or ''ojos de agua''), and eventually the brackish [[mangrove]] [[estuary]] where the Yucatán [[aquifer]] empties into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] near the ancient Maya coastal site of [[Canbalam]].  It is likely that ancient Chunchucmil was purposefully situated to take advantage of multiple [[ecoregion|ecological zones]], including coastal resources such as the [[Salt evaporation pond|salt-beds]] of the [[Celestún]] peninsula, and to increase accessibility to the vigorous circum-peninsular [[canoe]] [[trade route]] of [[Pre-Columbian]] times, using Canbalam as its port of entry.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlin et al. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The term "Chunchucmil" was originally used to name a freshwater well (''Ch'en Chun Chukum''), the central water source for the cattle ranch that eventually grew to become the historic [[henequen]] hacienda of Chunchucmil.  Most wells in this region are named after animals or plants.  In this case, the words ''Ch'en Chun Chukum'' literally mean "the well at the base of the Chukum tree" (''[[Havardia albicans]]'').  Local [[Yucatec Maya language|Maya speakers]] still refer to the modern village of Chunchucmil as ''Chun Chukum'' when speaking in their native tongue.  The ancient Maya archaeological site was given the name Chunchucmil by archaeologists in the 1970s because that was the closest modern community to the site center.&lt;ref&gt;Garza &amp; Kurjack 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  Local [[Maya peoples|Maya villagers]] today do not have a single term to refer to the ruins, since the ancient city is so large that it encompasses most of their lands.

===Site size===
[[Image:Chun-airsar-dem-orthophoto.jpg|thumb|right|Digital Elevation Model combined with an aerial photograph showing pyramidal architecture of Chunchucmil]]The exact size of Chunchucmil is currently being studied using [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], and survey [[transects]] by the Pakbeh Regional Economy Project (who have been working at Chunchucmil since the mid-1990s, under the direction of Dr. Bruce H. Dahlin).  Estimates range from 25&amp;nbsp;km² for the more compact urban settlement to around 64&amp;nbsp;km² for the city and its adjoining suburbs and farmsteads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.famsi.org/aztlan/uploads/papers/Hixson-MayaNewsletter.pdf Hixson 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, this places the site of Chunchucmil among some of the largest and most densely settled ancient Maya polities.

===Chronology===
[[Sherd|Ceramic data]] indicate that the Chunchucmil region was occupied from the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic period|Middle Preclassic]] (Middle Formative) through the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic period|Postclassic]] periods of Maya prehistory.  However, widespread test excavations within the architectural groups of ancient Chunchucmil indicate that the city reached its apogee during the latter part of the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic period|Early Classic]] and the early part of the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic period|Late Classic]], attaining its maximum spatial extent, population, and structural density.  This period is defined in some areas as the  "Middle Classic."&lt;ref&gt;Varela 1990; see also Ardren 2000; Stanton 2000; Dahlin &amp; Mazeau 2002, 2004, and Hutson et al. 2005, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chunchucmil appears to have gone into decline during the latter part of the Late Classic.  The [[Mesoamerican chronology|Terminal Classic]] (or [[Puuc]]) occupation at Chunchucmil is ephemeral at best, and the Postclassic occupation at the site consisted of [[squatter]]-like settlement.  A few early [[New Spain|colonial]] homesteads have been found, but the region was largely abandoned between the Maya Postclassic period and the beginnings of the cattle ranches and henequen haciendas of [[Yucatán (state)#Mid 19th century through mid 20th century|historic]] and modern times.

==Built environment==
[[Image:Chunchucmil-sitecentermap.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the central 1 km² of ancient Chunchucmil]]

===Monumental architecture===
[[Image:chunchucmil-reconstruction-2.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstruction of the "Pich" Quadrangle Group at Chunchucmil]]The Classic Period site center of Chunchucmil is dominated by over a dozen [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] ranging in height from 8 to 18&amp;nbsp;m (26 to 60&amp;nbsp;ft) tall.  Each pyramid is part of a structural arrangement referred to as a “quadrangle group” by members of the Pakbeh Regional Economy Project.  Quadrangle groups consist of an enclosed [[courtyard]] flanked by a pyramid on one side (which faces inward towards the courtyard) and a number of ranged and compact structures along the remaining three sides.   Within each quadrangle group's courtyard is a small central platform that is interpreted as a focal point of ritualized activities (such as an [[altar]]).  Other ceremonies would have taken place within the [[temple]]s atop each pyramid.  With the temple pyramids and central platforms acting as loci of [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]-based ritual, quadrangle groups likely housed the upper-echelon [[elites]] of ancient Chunchucmil that may have been active in the socio-political, ideological and economic administration of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlin &amp; Ardren 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of particular importance is the fact that each major quadrangle group is connected to the others through a network of [[sacbe]]ob (stone causeways), suggesting an unknown degree of connectedness between the residing lineages and (potentially) cooperation or competition in ruling Chunchucmil. If this was indeed the case, Chunchucmil's political structure may have been roughly analogous to that suggested for the later Maya capital of [[Chichen Itza]], referred to as a "multepal" system and characterized as rulership through council.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006:581.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residential architecture===
Residential architecture at Chunchucmil often follows the same pattern as the large quadrangle groups, with structures arranged on four sides of a small plaza.  This arrangement conforms to the "patio cluster" or "patio group" model for Maya residential organization, where two or more structures, potentially housing multiple family units, face a shared patio or courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;Ashmore 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilk 1988:143&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:chunchucmil-reconstruction-3.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstruction of the "Lóol" Residential Group at Chunchucmil]] At Chunchucmil, these clusters of associated structures are encircled by low-lying stone walls (called ''albarradas''), that demarcate domestic space by bounding the group’s residential lot or yard (called a ''solar'').  The entire unit, consisting of the architecture and the associated solar, is today referred to as an "albarrada group".  Unlike at the vast majority of Maya sites, Chunchucmil’s albarrada groups contain clear boundaries between residential house lots&lt;ref&gt;Vlcek 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and, as of result of this, researchers are better able to study such issues as settlement patterns, occupational density, population estimates, lineage structure, and social organization.&lt;ref&gt;Hutson et al. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutson et al. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many residential groups had a small temple or shrine (similar to the placement of the temple pyramids of their larger counterparts).  These buildings served as loci for the performance of household rituals or other types of ideological practices.&lt;ref&gt;Magnoni et al. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; One such residential shrine that has been excavated and consolidated at the Lool Group revealed its form to be [[Mesoamerican architecture#Talud-tablero|''talud-tablero'']].  This style of architecture is most famous at sites in Central Mexico, such as at the contemporaneous city of [[Teotihuacan]].  Beneath the stair of this shrine was a vessel that also replicated the pottery of that Central Mexican city.  While this should not be used as evidence of direct Teotihuacan influence, it does suggest Chunchucmil's participation in the greater Mesoamerican communication sphere at the time of Teotihuacan's dominance.  It should also be noted that all other structures excavated at Chunchucmil thus far lack demonstrable Teotihuacan influence.

===Transportation arteries===
[[Image:Chunchucmil-callejuela.jpg|thumb|left|Pathway (''Callejuela'') between two albarrada groups of Chunchucmil]][[Image:Chunchucmil-Sacbe.jpg|thumb|View along Sacbe 2, towards the "Chukum" Quadrangle Group]]One of the distinguishing characteristics of Chunchucmil is its network of stone-lined paths.  As mentioned above, the majority of residential lots are surrounded by albarradas (stone walls) that, when viewed on a map, give the site a honeycomb appearance.  The space between adjacent albarradas form avenues or paths for foot traffic (called ''callejuelas'', see photo) that radiate outward from the site center and into Chunchucmil's dense residential zone.  By mapping these formations, researchers have been able to better understand the flow of traffic in and out of the site center as well as the relationship between Chunchucmil's central core, its residential urban sprawl, and its outlying peripheral settlement.

Beyond Chunchucmil, in the seasonally inundated western wetlands, researchers have found a network of rock alignments that connect Chunchucmil's periphery to other outlying settlements.  Such rock alignments, called ''andadores'' by Maya archaeologists, would have provided sure footing through the wetlands, like stepping stones, leading travelers to various towns and resources in Chunchucmil's hinterland.  While not all of these andadores have been followed to their final destinations, the general orientation of the longest alignments suggest that they may have functioned to connect Chunchucmil with the coast near Canbalam.&lt;ref&gt;see report chapters by Hixson in Ardren 2000; Stanton 2000; Dahlin &amp; Mazeau 2002, 2004; and Hutson et al. 2005, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barricade and abandonment===
One of the first features of Chunchucmil to gain widespread attention was a stone wall, visible in aerial photos taken by the Atlas project,&lt;ref&gt;Garza &amp; Kurjack 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; that roughly encircles 350,000&amp;nbsp;square metres of the site center (including most of the major Quadrangle Groups).&lt;ref&gt;Kurjack &amp; Andrews 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early reconnaissance by the Pakbeh Regional Economy Project in the late 1990s found that the wall, which stood between 1 and 1.5&amp;nbsp;m tall and had a perimeter of 1.8&amp;nbsp;km, was incomplete.  It formed a large "C" shape with a 340&amp;nbsp;m wide gap open to the west (see map).  Further mapping and excavation revealed that the wall runs above every major feature at the ancient site (crossing sacbeob', albarradas, and many residential groups).  Based upon the [[law of superposition]] (an archaeological concept borrowed from the field of [[geology]]), this meant that the large barricade was likely the last feature to be built at the site.  Furthermore, the stones used to create the barricade were clearly robbed from nearby structures (rather than freshly quarried).  Given this data, it has been hypothesized that the barricade was constructed rapidly at the end of Chunchucmil's history, possibly to protect the remaining inhabitants from an invasion that arrived before the wall could be completed,&lt;ref&gt;Dahlin 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the ultimate demise of the ancient city.

==Economy and diet==

===Lithic economy===
[[Image:chunchucmil-obsidian.jpg|thumb|Obsidian prismatic blade fragment, Chunchucmil]]The chipped-stone [[Assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]] of Chunchucmil is dominated by [[obsidian]] [[prismatic blade]]s.  The [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|prismatic blade industry]] was ubiquitous throughout [[Mesoamerica]] and primarily used in the [[lithic reduction|production]] of obsidian tools.  [[Lithic analysis|Lithic analyses]] have determined that the majority of the blades at Chunchucmil were likely imported in finished form, as suggested by the general scarcity of [[lithic core|polyhedral cores]], [[debitage|production debitage]], rejuvenation artifacts, and manufacturing errors at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Clark 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark &amp; Bryant 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of tools made from obsidian, especially [[Biface|formal bifacial tools]], are rare, but present, at Chunchucmil.  Bifacial obsidian tools include a small collection of [[projectile point]]s and ambiguous tool fragments.  [[Uniface|Unifacial]] tools are generally absent.  Other types of industries, such as expedient [[Lithic flake|flake]] production or bipolar reduction, are also absent at Chunchucmil.

The exploitation of non-obsidian stone resources (e.g., [[chert]], [[chalcedony]], and [[quartz]]) did occur at Chunchucmil, but these materials are much less common than obsidian.  The majority of these resources, especially chert, were obtained locally from nodules in the limestone bedrock, but were very poor in quality.  While a number of formal tools were produced from chert and quartz, most non-obsidian tools were informal and produced through expedient flake production.

The fact that obsidian was favored over local resources for utilitarian tools is interesting, especially considering that obsidian had to be imported over long distances.  The [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|El Chayal]] obsidian source (which is the most common at Chunchucmil), is located nearly 1000&amp;nbsp;km (621&amp;nbsp;mi) away ([[as the crow flies]]) in [[Guatemala]].  This, once again, indicates Chunchucmil's close ties with external trade routes and the greater Mesoamerican world of the Classic period.

===Market system===
[[Image:Chunchucmil-marketplace.jpg|thumb|View of market area and surrounding landscape, Chunchucmil.]]The site of Chunchucmil is also notable for the likely presence of a [[marketplace]].&lt;ref&gt;Dahlin et al. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Geochemical soil tests combined with careful excavations of an open area in the site center have revealed a possible market for distributing [[Food|comestibles]] and other goods.  Excavations also revealed ephemeral stone alignments that may have been brace foundations for perishable market stall walls.  High levels of [[phosphorus]] correlate with these alignments, suggesting high concentrations of [[Decomposition|organic decay]].  Additionally, the distribution of obsidian within the Chunchucmil region itself, especially among a variety of sociocultural contexts,&lt;ref&gt;Hirth 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; may also indicate the presence of a [[market economy]], which is relatively rare among Early Classic Maya economies.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlin 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsistence===
As mentioned above, one important question concerning ancient Chunchucmil is how such a large population could have survived in one of the poorest areas for [[agriculture]].  According to bone [[Isotopic signature|isotope]] studies conducted by Pakbeh Regional Economy Project member Geni Mansell,&lt;ref&gt;[http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~rtykot/13%20Mansell%20et%20al.pdf Mansell et al. 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; the diet of the ancient inhabitants may have been more diversified than in other areas of the Maya region.  When compared with skeletal remains from other parts of Yucatán, [[Belize]] and the southern Maya lowlands, human remains from Chunchucmil indicate that their [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] included significantly less [[maize|corn]] (''maize'', the staple crop for most communities in the Maya area).  Access to the more ecologically diverse wetlands and coastal resources, as well as access to inter-regional trade routes and a centralized marketplace, may have been critical to ancient subsistence at Chunchucmil.&lt;ref&gt;see also, Dahlin et al. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6975">[[Cultural identity]] refers to a person's sense of belonging to a particular [[culture]] or group.  This process involves learning about and accepting [[traditions]], [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], [[language]], [[religion]], [[ancestry]], [[aesthetics]], thinking patterns, and [[social structure]]s of a culture.  Normally, people internalize the beliefs, values, norms, and social practices of their culture and identify themselves with that culture.  The culture becomes a part of their [[self-concept]] (Lustig, 2013).  However, some studies have noted that existing cultural identity theory may not account for the fact that different individuals and groups may not react to or interpret events, happenings, attitudes, etc. in the same ways as other individuals or groups.

Myron Lustig notes that cultural identities are central to a person’s sense of self.  That is because cultural identities “are central, dynamic, and multifaceted components of one’s self concept” (Lustig, 133).  Lustig also points out that cultural identities are dynamic, and they exist within a changing social context.  As a result, a person’s identity changes as do one’s ongoing experiences in life (Lustig, 135).  Other researchers describe cultural identity as referring to the content of values as guiding principles, to meaningful symbols, and to life styles that individuals share with others, though not necessarily within recognizable groups (Boski et al., 2004).  In addition, Boski et al. point out that most books and studies have ignored cultural identity as a theoretical construct in the field of [[cross-cultural psychology]].  Instead, books and journals report works on the theme of social identity.  [[Social identity]] is described as a sense of “We-ness,” or attachment to a group that one is a member of, and by comparison to others.  The sense of “We-ness” remains culturally empty, however.  Even with natural groups, it is portrayed in trait-attributes, “which is not different from those used to characterize individuals” (Boski et al., 2004).  There is, however, research evidence about the social (ethnic) vs. cultural distinction (Sanchez-Burks et al., 2000).  This study found that the task-oriented cultural style was generally more favored than the task-plus interpersonal alternative, particularly among Anglo-American participants, for whom ethnicity did not matter.  Mexican and Latino participants, however, showed some degree of favoritism toward ethnically similar participants (Sanchez-Burks et all, 2000).

It seems that there are different viewpoints regarding cultural and social identities.  Cultural identity is defined as the identity of a group or culture or of an individual as far as one is influenced by one’s belonging to a group or culture.  Further, Cultural identity is similar to, and overlaps with, [[identity politics]].  New forms of identification have been suggested to break down the understanding of the individual as a whole subject into a collection of various cultural identifiers.  Such identifiers can result from various conditions including: location, gender, race, history, nationality, language, sexuality, religious beliefs, ethnicity, aesthetics, and even food.  In places like the U.S. and Canada, where the people are ethnically diverse, social unity is primarily based on common social values and beliefs.  However, some critics of cultural identity declare that cultural identity based upon difference is a divisive force in society.  In addition, cultural identity may be defined by the social network of people imitating and following the social norms as presented by the media.  Therefore, instead of learning behavior and knowledge from cultural or religious groups, people may be learning social norms from the media to build on their cultural identity.  Language may also be an important factor in culture identity.  The communication that comes with sharing a language promotes connections and roots to ancestors and cultural histories.

	When young people are severed from the ideals and positively sanctioned statuses, feelings of alienation or social isolation may develop.  These feelings can result in undesired treatment and status.  This process results in personal marginalization, and it may lead to social marginalization which includes that person’s relative economic, employment, educational, and cultural loss compared to those around him.  This provides a second source of alienation from mainstream society.  This can cause an individual to experience extreme discomfort called ego identity discomfort.  Because external sources have too much control, the individual cannot construct a personal definition of him/her self.  The person is then motivated to identify with an alternative social group such as a drug subcultural group.  Such groups provide opportunities to resolve identity problems.   Identification with such a group reduces the person’s ego identity discomfort, or it helps to solve identity problems.  Scholars today are focusing on the basic elements of social organization (race, ethnicity, gender, and social class) in their theory and research.  In the case of drug subcultures, it is reported that Anderson (1998) discovered that the composition of the drug subcultural groups differed between blacks and whites.  Blacks described neighborhood and school based groups as securing an improved social status and reputation.  On the other hand, Anderson (1998) found that the drug subcultural groups reported by whites differed.  These groups were located at nightclubs, bars, colleges, high schools and around the neighborhood.  Some of these groups were “other” activity oriented, such as college groups or the entertainment industry, and these groups had a “very strong” interest in drugs.  Whites reported using many different drugs, from alcohol and cocaine to marijuana and heroin.  These differences are significant, and such differences could alter the cultural identity theory. This is because different groups, such as blacks and whites, perceive events and problems in different ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3017">{{for|the 19th-century art movement known as eclecticism|academic art}}
'''Eclecticism''' is a kind of mixed style in the [[fine arts]]: "the borrowing of a variety of [[Art movement|style]]s from different sources and combining them" {{harv|Hume|1998|loc=5}}. Significantly, Eclecticism hardly ever constituted a specific style in [[art]]: it is characterized by the fact that it was not a particular style. In general, the term describes the combination in a single work of a variety of influences—mainly of elements from different historical styles in [[architecture]], [[painting]], and the [[graphic arts|graphic]] and [[decorative arts]]. In [[music]] the term used may be either [[Eclecticism in music|eclecticism]] or [[polystylism]].

==In the visual arts==
The term '''eclectic''' was first used by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] to characterize the art of the [[The Carracci|Carracci]], who incorporated in their paintings elements from the [[Renaissance]] and [[Art in ancient Greece#Classical|classic]]al traditions. Indeed, [[Agostino Carracci|Agostino]], [[Annibale Carracci|Annibale]] and [[Lodovico Carracci]] had tried to combine in their art [[Michelangelo]]'s line, [[Titian]]'s [[color]], [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]]'s [[chiaroscuro]], and [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]'s [[symmetry]] and [[wiktionary:grace|grace]]. 

In the 18th century, [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], head of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in [[London]], was one of the most influential advocates of eclecticism. In the sixth of his famous academical ''Discourses'' (1774), he wrote that the painter may use the work of the ancients as a "magazine of common property, always open to the public, whence every man has a right to take what materials he pleases" {{harv|Reynolds|1775|loc=26}}.

==Western architecture==
{{see also|Victorian architecture|Revivalism (architecture)}}
Early examples of eclectic architecture were built in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], particularly in the [[Palazzina Cinese]] in [[Palermo]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}.
[[File:Palazzina cinese 0004.JPG|thumb|[[Palazzina Cinese]] in [[Palermo]]|alt=Palazzina cinese 0004.JPG]]

Eclecticism "was an important concept in Western architecture during the mid- and late 19th century, and it reappeared in a new guise in the latter part of the 20th century" {{harv|Muthesius|n.d.}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34539">In a paper delivered to the [[Aristotelian Society]] on 12 March 1956,&lt;ref&gt;Published immediately as Gallie (1956a); a later, slightly altered version appears in Gallie (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. B. Gallie|Walter Bryce Gallie]] (1912&amp;ndash;1998) introduced the term '''essentially contested concept''' to facilitate an understanding of the different applications or interpretations of the sorts of abstract, [[Qualitative properties|qualitative]], and [[Evaluation|evaluative]] notions&lt;ref&gt;They are "evaluative" in the sense that they deliver some sort of "value-judgement".&lt;/ref&gt;—such as "[[art]]" and "[[social justice]]"—used in the domains of [[aesthetics]], [[political philosophy]], [[philosophy of history]], and [[philosophy of religion]].

Garver (1978) describes their use as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The term essentially contested concepts gives a name to a problematic situation that many people recognize: that in certain kinds of talk there is a variety of meanings employed for key terms in an argument, and there is a feeling that [[Dogma#Dogma outside of religion|dogmatism]] ("My answer is right and all others are wrong"), [[skepticism]] ("All answers are equally true (or false); everyone has a right to his own truth"), and [[eclecticism]] ("Each meaning gives a partial view so the more meanings the better") are none of them the appropriate attitude towards that variety of meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Garver (1978), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Essentially contested concepts involve widespread agreement on a [[concept]] (e.g., "fairness"), but not on the best realization thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Hart (1961, p. 156) speaks of "a uniform or constant feature", and "a shifting or varying criterion used in determining when, for any given purposes, cases are alike or different".&lt;/ref&gt; They are "concepts the proper use of which inevitably involves endless disputes about their proper uses on the part of their users",&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), p. 169. The dispute is about the proper use of the concept; and all argue that the concept is being "used inappropriately" by others (Smith, 2002, p. 332).&lt;/ref&gt; and these disputes "cannot be settled by appeal to [[empirical evidence]], linguistic usage, or the canons of logic alone".&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1977), p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identifying the presence of a dispute==

Although Gallie's term is widely used to denote imprecise use of [[technical terminology]], it has a far more specific application. And, although the notion could be misleadingly and evasively used to justify "agreeing to disagree",&lt;ref&gt;A statement that, in essence, is usually nothing more than a simple observation that the apparent dispute it is simply a consequence of the same label being applied to different referents.&lt;/ref&gt; the term offers something more valuable:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since its introduction by W.B. Gallie in 1956, the expression "essentially contested concept" has been treated both as a challenge and as an excuse by social theorists. It has been treated as a challenge in that theorists consider their uses of terms and concepts to be in competition with the uses advocated by other theorists, each theorist trying to be deemed the champion. It has been treated as an excuse in that, rather than acknowledge that the failure to reach agreement is due to such factors as imprecision, ignorance, or belligerence, instead theorists point to the terms and concepts under dispute and insist that they are always open to contest — that they are terms and concepts about which we can never expect to reach agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes (2000), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The disputes that attend an essentially contested concept are driven by substantive disagreements over a range of different, entirely [[reasonable]] (although perhaps mistaken) interpretations of a mutually-agreed-upon [[archetypical]] notion, such as the legal precept "treat like cases alike; and treat different cases differently", with "each party [continuing] to defend its case with what it claims to be convincing arguments, evidence and other forms of justification".&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a) p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallie speaks of how "This picture is painted in [[Oil paint|oils]]" can be successfully contested if the work is actually painted in [[tempera]];&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; while "This picture is a work of art" may meet strong opposition due to disputes over what "work of art" denotes. He suggests three avenues whereby one might resolve such disputes:
#Discovering a new meaning of "work of art" to which all disputants could thenceforward agree.
#Convincing all the disputants to conform to one meaning. 
#Declaring "work of art" to be a number of different concepts employing the same name.
 
Otherwise, the dispute probably centres on [[polysemy]].&lt;ref&gt;The embedded meaning of the term ''[[polysemy]]'' is that the polysemous word’s meanings have multiplied over time (in the sense of its original meaning being extended).
* When discussing finance, "bank" is an essentially contested concept; because the discussion involves establishing the "correct" application, meaning or interpretation of this polysemous term.
* In a different dispute over banks, where one speaks of [[Bank|financial institutions]] and the other of [[riparian zones]], it is obvious that two [[homonyms]] have been confused.&lt;/ref&gt;
Here, a number of critical questions must be asked:
* Has the term been incorrectly used, as in the case of mistakenly using [[Decimation (Roman Army)|decimated]] for devastated ([[catachresis]])?&lt;ref&gt;Which is "''a conflict between truth and error''" (Garver, 1990, p. 259)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Do two or more different concepts share the same word, as in the case of ''ear'', ''bank'', ''sound'', ''corn'', ''scale'', etc. ([[homonymy]])?&lt;ref&gt;Which is "''a disagreement generated because the parties to the conflict are [[talking past each other]]''" (Garver, 1990, p. 259) – the "talking past each other" is an allusion to the interaction between [[Thrasymachus]] and [[Socrates]] over the question of "justice" in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato dialogue)|Republic I]]'', where neither addressed any of the issues raised by the other. Gallie (1956a, p. 168.) speaks of this as being a case in which "''two '''different''' concepts about whose proper application no one need to have contested at all''" having become "'''confused'''".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Is there a genuine dispute about the term's correct application that, in fact, ''can'' be resolved?
* Or, is it really the case that the term is an ''essentially contested concept''?

===Contested versus contestable===
Clarke has made a valuable contribution to the overall debate by suggesting that, in order to determine whether a particular dispute was a consequence of true polysemy or inadvertent homonymy, one should seek to "locate the source of the dispute".

This source might be "within the concept itself", or "[within] some underlying non-conceptual disagreement between the contestants".&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1979), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke then drew attention to the substantial differences between the expressions "essentially contested" and "essentially contestable", that were being extensively used within the literature as though they were interchangeable.

Clarke argued that to state that a concept is merely "contested" is to "attribute significance to the contest rather than to the concept". Yet, to state that a concept is "contestable" is to "attribute some part of any contest to the concept". In other words, this is "to claim that some feature or property of the concept makes it polysemantic, and that the concept contains some internal conflict of ideas"; and it is this fact that provides the "essentially contested concept" with its ''inherent potential'' for "generating disputes".&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1979), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
In 1956 Gallie proposed a set of seven conditions for the existence of an essentially contested concept.&lt;ref&gt;See Gallie (1956a).&lt;/ref&gt; Gallie was very specific about the limits of his enterprise: it dealt exclusively with abstract, qualitative notions, such as ''art'', ''religion'', ''science'', ''democracy'', and ''social justice''&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), passim. Kekes (1977, p. 71) offers ''art'', ''morality'', ''logic'', ''the novel'', ''nature'', ''rationality'', ''democracy'', ''culture'', ''science'', and ''philosophy'' as another set of examples of "concepts" that are ''essentially contested''.&lt;/ref&gt; (and, if Gallie’s choices are contrasted with negatively regarded concepts such as ''evil'', ''disease'', ''superstition'', etc., it is clear that the concepts he chose were exclusively positively regarded).

Freeden remarks that "not all essentially contested concepts signify valued achievements; they may equally signify disapproved and denigrated phenomena",&lt;ref&gt;Freeden (1998), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gerring&lt;ref&gt;Gerring (1999), p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; asks us to imagine just how difficult it would be to "[try] to craft definitions of slavery, fascism, terrorism, or genocide without recourse to 'pejorative' attributes".

These features distinguish Gallie's "essentially contested concepts" from others, "which can be shown, as a result of analysis or experiment, to be radically confused";&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; or, as Gray&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1977), p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; would have it, they are the features that relate to the task of distinguishing the "general words, which really denote an essentially contested concept" from those other "general words, whose uses conceal a diversity of distinguishable concepts":&lt;ref&gt;They are unpackings of, elaborations upon, or extensions of Gallie's original seven features that have been made by a very wide range of scholars spread over a wide range of academic and intellectual pursuits over the last 60 years.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Essentially contested concepts are ''evaluative'', and they deliver ''value-judgements''.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin stresses that whilst "''not all value judgements are appraisive''", "''[any act of] appraisal presupposes an accepted set of criteria''" (Baldwin (1997), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Essentially contested concepts denote comprehensively evaluated entities that have an ''internally complex'' character.&lt;ref&gt;For this reason, Benn and Gaus (1983, pp. 3-5) advocate using the term "''complex-structured concepts''".&lt;/ref&gt;
#The evaluation must be attributed to the internally complex entity ''as a whole''. 
#The different ''constituent elements'' of that internally complex entity are initially ''variously describable''.
#The different users of the concept will often allocate substantially different orders of ''relative importance'', substantially different "''weights''", and/or substantially different ''interpretations'' to each of those constituent elements.
#Psychological and sociological causes influence the extent to which any particular ''consideration'' is ''salient'' for a given individual, regarded as a ''stronger reason'' by that individual than by another, and regarded as ''a reason'' by one individual and not by another.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1990), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The disputed concepts are ''open-ended''&lt;ref&gt;Gallie cites "''democracy''" an example of a concept being "''open''" in its character: "''Politics being the art of the possible, '''democratic targets will be raised or lowered as circumstances alter''', and democratic achievements are always judged in the light of such alterations''" (Gallie, 1956a, p. 186, emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt; and vague, and are subject to considerable modification in the light of ''changing circumstances''.&lt;ref&gt;Because, in the absence of this condition, it is possible that experience could establish one ''instantiation'' as "''universally more acceptable than another''" (Gallie, 1956a, p. 174).&lt;/ref&gt;
#This further modification can neither be ''predicted'' nor ''prescribed'' in advance.
#Whilst, by Gallie's express stipulation, there is no ''best'' instantiation of an essentially contested concept (or, at least, none knowable to be the best), it is also obvious that some instantiations will be considerably ''better'' than others;&lt;ref&gt;Swanton (1985), p. 815.&lt;/ref&gt; and, furthermore, even if one particular instantiation seems best at the moment, there is always the possibility that a new, better instantiation will emerge in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1990), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Each party knows and recognizes that its own peculiar usage/interpretation of the concept is disputed by others who, in their turn, hold different and quite incompatible views.&lt;ref&gt;For, otherwise, it would only be, at best, an essentially "''contestable''" concept.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Each party must (at least to a certain extent) understand the criteria upon which the other participants’ (repudiated) views are based.
#Disputes centred on essentially contested concepts are "perfectly genuine", "not resolvable by argument",&lt;ref&gt;Connolly (1974, p. 40) expressed the view that once the participants in a particular political dispute realized that the concept was an essentially contested concept, the ensuing political discussions would be far more "''enlightened''" (Connolly, 1974, p. 40).&lt;/ref&gt; and "nevertheless sustained by perfectly respectable arguments and evidence".&lt;ref&gt;All from Gallie (1956a), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Each party's use of their own specific usage/interpretation is driven by a need to ''uphold'' their own particular (''correct'', ''proper'' and ''superior'') usage/interpretation against that of all other (''incorrect'', ''improper'' and ''irrational'') users.
#Because the use of an essentially contested concept is always the application of one use ''against'' all other uses, any usage is intentionally ''aggressive'' and ''defensive''.
#Because it is essentially contested, rather than "radically confused", the continued use of the essentially contested concept is justified by the fact that, despite all of their on-going disputation, ''all'' of the competitors acknowledge that the contested concept is derived from a ''single common exemplar''.&lt;ref&gt;This agreement is ''a pre-requisite for'' the argument, it is not ''a consequence of'' the argument. See McKnight (2003), p. 261; and Perry (1977), p. 25. In an attempt to account for cases where disputants trace their individual notions back to ''entirely different'', but ''mutually compatible exemplars'', Connolly (1974, p. 14) proposes that we think of the shared exemplar as a "cluster concept".&lt;/ref&gt;
#The continued use of the essentially contested concept also helps to sustain and develop our understanding of the concept's original exemplar/s.

== Concepts and conceptions ==
Scholars such as [[H. L. A. Hart]], [[John Rawls]], [[Ronald Dworkin]], and [[Steven Lukes]] have variously embellished Gallie's proposal by arguing that certain of the difficulties encountered with Gallie’s proposition may be due a consequence of the unintended [[Conflation#Logic|conflation]] of two separate domains associated with the term ''concept'':
: (a) the ''concepts'' (the abstract, ideal ''notions'' themselves), and
: (b) the ''conceptions'' (the particular ''instantiations'', or ''realizations'' of those ideal and abstract notions).&lt;ref&gt;The concept/conception terminology seems to originate with Gallie's (1956a) own comment that, whilst they might still continue to employ the contested ''concept'', the "different teams [could] come to hold… very different ''conceptions'' of how the game should be played" (p. 176, emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, Hart (1961), Rawls (1971), Dworkin (1972), and Lukes (1974) distinguished between the "unity" of a notion and the "multiplicity" of its possible instantiations.

From their work it is easy to understand the issue as one of determining whether there is a single notion that has a number of different instantiations, or whether there is more than one notion, each of which is reflected in a different ''usage''.

In a section of his 1972 article in ''The New York Review of Books'', Dworkin used the example of "fairness" to isolate and elaborate the difference between a ''concept'' (''[[Jedem das Seine|suum cuique]]'') and its ''conception'' (various instantiations, for example [[utilitarian ethics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin (1972), pp. 27-28 (an almost identical passage appears at Dworkin, 1972, pp. 134-135). The four-paragraph passage is in Section II of the article [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/10204]. It commences with "''But the theory of… ''" and ends with "''…I try to answer it ''".&lt;/ref&gt;

He supposes that he has instructed his children not to treat others "unfairly" and asks us to recognize that, whilst he would have undoubtedly had particular "examples" (of the sorts of conduct he was intending to discourage) in mind at the time he spoke to his children, whatever it was that he ''meant'' when he issued such instructions was not confined to those "examples" alone, for two reasons:

#"I would expect my children to apply my instructions to situations I had not and could not have thought about."
#"I stand ready to admit that some particular act I had thought was fair when I spoke was in fact unfair, or vice versa, if one of my children is able to convince me of that later."

Dworkin argues that this admission of error would not entail any "change" to his original instructions, because the true ''meaning'' of his instructions was that "[he] meant the family to be guided by the ''concept'' of fairness, not by any specific ''conception'' of fairness [that he] might have had in mind". Therefore, he argues, his instructions do, in fact, "cover" this new case.
 
Exploring what he considers to be the "crucial distinction" between the overall ''concept'' of "fairness" and some particular, and specific ''conception'' of "fairness", he asks us to imagine a group whose members share the view that certain acts are ''unfair''.&lt;ref&gt;These unfair acts involve either "a wrongful division of benefits and burdens, or a wrongful attribution of praise or blame".&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of this group "agree on a great number of standard cases of unfairness and use these as benchmarks against which to test other, more controversial cases".

In these circumstances, says Dworkin, "the group has a ''concept'' of unfairness, and its members may appeal to that concept in moral instruction or argument."&lt;ref&gt;Emphasis added to original.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the members may still disagree over many of these "controversial cases"; and differences of this sort indicate that members ''have'', or ''act upon'', entirely different theories of why and how each of the "standard cases" are, in fact, genuine acts of "unfairness".

And, because each considers that certain principles "[which] must be relied upon to show that a particular division or attribution is unfair" are far a more "fundamental" sort of principle than certain other principles, it can be said that members of the group have different ''conceptions'' of "fairness".

Consequently, those responsible for giving "instructions", and those responsible for setting "standards" of "fairness", in this community may be doing one of two things:
#Appealing to the ''concept'' of "fairness", by demanding that others act "fairly". In this case, those instructed to act "fairly" are responsible for "developing and applying their own conception of fairness as controversial cases arise".&lt;ref&gt;He notes that this does not "[grant] them a discretion to act as they like''"; but, from the fact that "it assumes that one conception is superior to another", it is clear that "it sets a standard they must try — and may fail — to meet".&lt;/ref&gt; Each of those issuing the instructions (or setting the standards) may have quite different explanations underlying their actions; and, also, they may well change their explanations from time to time, without ever changing the standards they set.&lt;ref&gt;Thus, we could say, there is a demand for [[orthopraxy]] (the correctness of action), not for [[orthodoxy]] (the correctness of thought).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Laying down a particular ''conception'' of "fairness"; by, for example, specifying that all hard cases were to be decided "by applying the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian ethics]] of [[Jeremy Bentham]]".

It is important to recognize that rather than it just being a case of delivering two different instructions; it is a case of delivering two different ''kinds'' of instruction:
#In the case of the appeal to the ''concept'' of "fairness", one invokes the ideal (and, implicitly, the universally agreed upon) notion of "fairness"; and whatever one might believe is the best ''instantiation'' of that notion is, by and large, irrelevant. 
#In the case of laying down a ''conception'' of "fairness", one specifies what one believes to be the best instantiation of the notion "fairness"; and, by this action, one specifies what one ''means'' by "fairness"; and whatever one might believe is the ideal ''notion'' of "fairness" is, by and large, irrelevant.

As a consequence, according to Dworkin, whenever an appeal is made to "fairness", a moral issue is raised; and, whenever a conception of "fairness" is laid down, an attempt is being made to answer that moral issue.

==Not "hotly disputed" concepts==
Whilst Gallie's expression "essentially contested concepts" precisely denotes those "essentially questionable and corrigible concepts" which "are permanently and essentially subject to revision and question",&lt;ref&gt;Hampshire (1965), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; close examination of the wide and varied and imprecise applications of Gallie's term subsequent to 1956, by those who have ascribed their own literal meaning to Gallie's term without ever consulting Gallie's work, have led many philosophers to conclude that "essentially disputed concepts" would have been far better choice for Gallie's meaning, for at least three reasons:

#Gallie's term has led many to the mistaken belief that he spoke of ''hotly disputed'', rather than ''essentially disputed'' concepts.&lt;ref&gt;See Waldron (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Expressly stipulating that a specific issue can never be resolved, and then calling it a "contest" seems both absurd and misleading.&lt;ref&gt;There seems to be a radical fault in the very notion of a contest that can not by its nature be won or lost. (Gray, 1999, p. 96)&lt;/ref&gt;
#Any assertion that "essentially contested" concepts are ''[[Commensurability (ethics)|incommensurable]]'' made at the same time as an assertion that "they have any common subject-matter" is incoherent; and, also, it reveals an "inconsistency in the idea of essential contestability".&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1999), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Waldron]]'s research has revealed that Gallie's notion has "run wild" in the law review literature over the ensuing 60 years and is now being used to denote something like "very hotly contested, with no resolution in sight",&lt;ref&gt;Waldron (2002, p. 149) found that the following concepts had been labelled as "essentially contested" in the [[Westlaw]] database: alienation, autonomy, author, bankruptcy, boycott, citizenship, civil rights, coherence, community, competition, the Constitution, corruption, culture, discrimination, diversity, equality, equal protection, freedom, harm, justification, liberalism, merit, motherhood, the national interest, nature, popular sovereignty, pornography, power, privacy, property, proportionality, prosperity, prostitution, public interest, punishment, reasonable expectations, religion, republicanism, rights, sovereignty, speech, sustainable development, and textuality.&lt;/ref&gt; due to an entirely mistaken view&lt;ref&gt;Of course, the equivalent view about the term in general is reasonable: it merely uses the descriptive [[definition]]. The descriptive definition is still a definition, even if one may think it less interesting than Gallie's definition.&lt;/ref&gt; that the ''essential'' in Gallie's term is an "[[intensifier]]", when, in fact, "[Gallie's] term 'essential' refers to the location of the disagreement or indeterminacy; it is contestation at the core, not just at the borderlines or penumbra of a concept".&lt;ref&gt;Waldron (2002), pp. 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet is also clear that "if the notion of logical justification can be applied only to such theses and arguments as can be presumed capable of gaining in the long run universal agreement, the disputes to which the uses of any essentially contested concept give rise are not genuine or rational disputes at all"{{clarify|date=May 2012}} (Gallie, 1956a, p.&amp;nbsp;188).

Thus, Gallie argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So long as contestant users of any essentially contested concept believe, however deludedly, that their own use of it is the only one that can command honest and informed approval, they are likely to persist in the hope that they will ultimately persuade and convert all their opponents by logical means. But once [we] let the truth out of the bag — i.e., the essential contestedness of the concept in question — then this harmless if deluded hope may well be replaced by a ruthless decision to cut the cackle, to damn the heretics and to exterminate the unwanted.&lt;ref&gt;Gallie, 1956a, pp. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4071">'''Fenslerfilm''' (stylized as '''FENSLERFILM''') is an [[United States|American]] video production company, based in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States, and headed by Eric Fensler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fenslerfilm.com/ |title=Fenslerfilm |publisher=Fenslerfilm |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company gained a reputation in 2003 for a series of [[short film]]s which parodied the [[public service announcement]] safety messages used at the end of every episode of the 1980s [[animated series]] ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|G.I. Joe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baldwin|first=Rosecrans|title=The Digital Ramble: Military Investigation|url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/the-digital-ramble-military-investigation/|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenslerfilm also did some ''[[Sealab 2021]]'' TV spots for [[Adult Swim]]. The spots mirrored the previous G.I. Joe PSAs in tone and execution, as they were animated and dubbed in a similar fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DeMartino|first=Joe|title=Eric Fensler: An interview with the creator of the GI Joe PSA parodies|url=http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2011/06/eric-fensler-an-interview-with-the-creator-of-the-gi-joe-psa-parodies.html|newspaper=WFMU|date=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fensler contributed music videos for the songs "Don't Mess With Illinois", "Hand Over Fist" and "Special Effect" by his fellow Chicagoans, electronic music group [[TRS-80 (group)|TRS-80]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TRS-80 at Frenetic Fringe Festival Sunday |url=http://www.29-95.com/art/story/trs-80-frenetic-fringe-festival-sunday |newspaper=29-95.com |date=August 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407084613/http://www.29-95.com/art/story/trs-80-frenetic-fringe-festival-sunday |archivedate=2011-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also produced a music video for [[Daniel Johnston]]'s song "The Monster Inside of Me", using footage from the [[Captain America]] [[The Marvel Super Heroes|animated series]] from the 1960s.

==In popular culture==
*In the movie tie-in video game, ''[[G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (video game)|G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra]]'', the developers [[Double Helix Games]] had planned to include the line "Porkchop Sandwiches" from one of Fensler's films as an exclamation, and had every voice actor record that line for its use. However, Hasbro rejected its use, citing the need to avoid damaging pending lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamervision.com/gamer/coop/news/article/_quot_porkchop_sandwiches_quot_cut_from_g_i_joe_game/ |title="Porkchop Sandwiches" Cut from G.I.

*The second season episode "Hate Floats" of the animated series ''[[The Venture Bros]]'' features the character Henchman 21 wearing a "porkchop sandwiches" shirt while out of uniform.
*[[Weezer]]'s "[[Pork and Beans (song)|Pork and Beans]]" music video, which features stars of internet viral videos, contains a scene in which young animated versions of the band are seen listening to ''G.I. Joe'' member Gung Ho.
*In the [[G.I. Joe (IDW Publishing)|IDW ''G.I. Joe'']] comic book series, Storm Shadow indicates that he wants to leave early, as he's in the mood for porkchop sandwiches.
*In ''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]'' after killing pig cops occasionally [[Duke Nukem (character)|Duke]] will say "Porkchop Sandwiches!". He will also utter the phrase "Body Massage!" after grabbing a vibrator in the Titty City level.

'''Friedrich Wilhelm Quintscher''' (October 3, 1883 – May 8, 1945), better known under his self-assumed name '''Rah Omir''' Quintscher, was a notable [[German people|German]] member of the [[Neopagan]] religion of [[Adonism]], as well as being a noted occultist and [[ceremonial magic]]ian. In 1922 he founded a group known as the Orden Mentalistischer Bauherren (Order of the Mental Architects), which he closed down in 1928, leading its members to join another occult group, the [[Fraternitas Saturni]]. He went on join the Adonistic Society of Franz Sättler, but fell out with him, possibly over a woman, Sättler's lover and secretary, Justine Schnattinger. Leaving the Adonistic Society, Quintscher went on to further propagate Adonism through his own esoteric group, the '''Atescha-Taganosyn'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gibeciere''' is a large pouch-like device used by [[magic (illusion)|magic]]ians as a utility device, most often to aid in the performance of the famous [[magic trick]] known as "[[Cups and balls|The Cups and Balls]]".  In modern times, it is often used by [[street magician]]s due to its ability to hold large items (frequently referred to as "loads" within performing circles) such as fruits, various balls and sometimes stuffed or even real animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Cramer|first=Stuart|last2=Willmarth|first2=Phil|date=October 1984|editor-last=Bamman|editor-first=Howard|title=Parade: Stuart Cramer|url=http://askalexander.org/display/40602/Linking+Ring/81|journal=The Linking Ring|publisher=The International Brotherhood of Magicians|volume=64|issue=10|pages=81–82|via=|editor first=|editor last=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It is commonly held around the performer's waist by a belt, in plain sight, and the pouch commonly rests along the front of the body, just below the waistline.

'''Global feminism''' is a [[feminist theory]] closely aligned with [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial theory]] and [[postcolonial feminism]]. It concerns itself primarily with the forward movement of [[women's rights]] on a global scale.  Using different historical lenses from the legacy of colonialism, global feminists adopt global causes and start movements which seek to dismantle what they argue are the currently predominant structures of global [[patriarchy]]. Global feminism is also known as '''world feminism''' and '''international feminism'''.

Two historical examples Global Feminists might use to expose patriarchal structures at work in colonized groups or societies are medieval Spain (late eleventh to thirteenth centuries) and nineteenth-century Cuba. The former example concerns women of the ''Mudejar'' communities of Islamic Spain and the strict sexual codes through which their social activity was regulated. ''Mudejar'' women could be sold into slavery as a result of sexual activity with a Christian man; this was to escape the deemed punishment. Because of their simultaneous roles as upholding one's family honor and one of "conquered status and gender", "''Mudejar'' women suffered double jeopardy in their sexual contact with Christians [in Spain]".&lt;ref name="Tmara L. Hunt and Micheline R. Lessard"&gt;Tamara L. Hunt and Micheline R. Lessard, eds. ''Women and the Colonial Gaze''. {{ISBN|0-8147-3647-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century Cuba can be looked at as an example of colonialism and neocolonialism working together in a slave-based society to affect women's lives under patriarchy, where Cuba "remained a Spanish colony while enduring a neocolonial relationship with the United States".&lt;ref name="Tmara L. Hunt and Micheline R. Lessard" /&gt; Havana, a city noted for its "absence of the female form", had, "of all the major cities in the West...the most strict social restrictions on the female portion of its population".&lt;ref name="Tmara L. Hunt and Micheline R. Lessard" /&gt; Upper-class Cuban women were "a constant visual reminder of the separation between elite white society and the people of color they ruled".&lt;ref name="Tmara L. Hunt and Micheline R. Lessard" /&gt;

==Transnational mothering==
Forced commitment to double shifts, struggle for individual autonomy, and blurring the private and [[public sphere]] of labor are all additional concerns to the primary issue for migrant women, which is the right to [[motherhood]]. The phenomena of motherhood in a [[transnational feminism|transnational]] and contemporary time creates structural constraints for migrant women. Abusive employers and intimate violence is not the only problem these women have to face, but there are structural issues regarding the right to motherhood in this transnational era.&lt;ref&gt;Ladd-Taylor, Molly. "Mother-Worship/Mother-Blame: Politics and Welfare in an Uncertain Age." Ed. Andrea O'Reilly. Maternal Theory: Essential Readings (2007): 640–48. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Women immigrants leave their chance overseas at an idealized motherhood of watching their children grow up while performing their [[gender role]], and deport to be the breadwinner. The restructuring of care from the effects of [[globalization]] and [[neoliberalism]] institutionalizes these women.

Globalization is constantly changing and as a result it is supporting the phenomena of women in the global south migrating to developed countries to serve domestic labors. The role of transnational mothering within a neoliberal spectrum affects the exploitation of women through the deprivation of their [[Civil and political rights|citizen rights]], by extracting the benefits of immigrant's labor while minimizing or eliminating any obligations, whether social or fiscal to the society or state.&lt;ref name="Choy, Catherine Ceniza 2003"&gt;Choy, Catherine Ceniza. (2003). "Empire of Care: Nursing and Migration in Filipino American History." Durham, NC: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Migrant women of [[Third World]] countries are not drawn from their countries to the advancing economy of the First World, rather drawn from their economies that have been disrupted and distorted by Western colonial incursions, leaving many to be torn free of their roots and recruited to countries to fill its non permanent labor needs, preventing competition with native workers; fulfilling the complementary void.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Evelyn Nakano. "Women and Labor Migration." Ed. Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan. An Introduction to Women's Studies: Gender in a Transnational World (2006): 444–48. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Transnational mothering is viewed as an accommodation for both classes.

Motherhood, along with [[reproductive freedom]] and marriage, is the fundamental right of women but is prohibited by nations that justify foreign domestic services, as much as view immigrant women as a threat to its nationalism.&lt;ref name="Choy, Catherine Ceniza 2003"/&gt; Nations create a process of [[racial formation]] through which women of different national and racial identities experience discrepant integration within a society, ultimately contributing to hierarchies of citizenship. In relation to [[social Darwinism]], natives believe that Third World migrants "just can't make it", and fear degeneration, thus nations try to weed out those who do not fit the upper or [[middle class]] society in ways such as sterilization; e.g.; black women are identified as devious, immoral, domineering, sexually promiscuous, and bad mothers, resulting in their reproductive rights being threatened by regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Dorothy, and Andrea O'Reilly. "Killing the Black Body." Maternal Theory: Essential Readings (2007): 482–500. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Hollinger box''', also known as a "document box" or "archives box," is a specially constructed cardboard box used in [[archives]] for [[Preservation_%28library_and_archival_science%29|preservation]] of documents and photographs. The term "Hollinger" refers to the manufacturer, Hollinger Metal Edge, a company founded in 1945 in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]]. Hollinger Metal Edge worked with officials at the [[Library of Congress]] and [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] of the United States to develop acid free papers, storage boxes and envelopes that would preserve archival collections.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollingermetaledge.com/modules/cms/index.html?pageID=9 "Our History," Hollinger Metal Edge Company&lt;/ref&gt; The boxes are designed for long-term storage, and typically rest on standard [[Bookcase#Library shelving|library shelving]].


The [[Society of American Archivists]] defines it as a "container that holds folders containing paper documents vertically and that measures roughly 10 inches high, 12 or 15 inches wide, and 6 or 3 inches deep, and that usually has an integral top hinged at the upper back."&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/d/document-box&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Maya civilization}}
'''La Amelia''' is a [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archaeological site near [[Itzan]], in the lower [[Pasión River]] region of the [[Petén Department]] of [[Guatemala]]. It formed a [[polity]] in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]] (AD 600 to 830), and was involved in the war between [[Tikal]] and [[Calakmul]] followed, in 650, by La Amelia's takeover by [[Dos Pilas]].  Two centuries of intermittent warfare followed until the area's population was so diminished by about 830, that this is considered the beginning of abandonment of Classic sites in the region.
==Location==
La Amelia is located on a series of low hills in the [[Municipalities of Guatemala|municipality]] of [[Sayaxché]], {{convert|4|km|mi}} south of La Florida and the [[Pasión River]]. The site sits at a level of {{convert|150|to|160|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level]]. The low-lying areas around the hills are prone to flooding.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz de León 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The main site area is maintained as a forest park by the nearby village of San Francisco El Tumbo. More than 90 percent of the mounds at the site have been looted.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
La Amelia was a subordinate site in the Classic Period [[Petexbatún]] kingdom of Mutal that was first ruled from [[Dos Pilas]] and then from [[Aguateca]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; The site is located to the northwest of Dos Pilas, and may have originally been called B'ahlam.&lt;ref&gt;Guenter, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; The rapidly expanding Dos Pilas kingdom conquered La Amelia in the early 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest et al 1991, p.229&lt;/ref&gt; The occupational history of La Amelia appears to have been brief and limited to the Late Classic.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz de León 2004, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In AD 802 the last known ruler of the kingdom, [[Tan Te' K'inich]], supervised a ritual conducted by the ruler of La Amelia, [[Lachan K'awiil Ajaw Bot]], the last reference anywhere to Tan Te' K'inich.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.409&lt;/ref&gt; Lachan K'awiil Ajaw Bot, the local La Amelia king, is depicted on La Amelia Panel 2, dated to AD 804 and continued to raise monuments at the site, the last of which that can be dated was erected in 807 and contains the last reference to the Petexbatún kingdom of Mutal.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Lachan K'awiil Ajaw Bot is also mentioned on Panel 1 and Hieroglyphic Stairway 1 at the site. He is known to have been born on 25 June 760 and to have been enthroned on 1 May 802.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

La Amelia was abandoned some time in the middle of the 9th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz de León 2004, pp.21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
The [[Carnegie Institution]] carried out investigations at the site in 1937. That project documented several carved stone monuments, and created a partial site map which was published by [[Sylvanus Morley]] in his 1938 volume ''The Inscriptions of Peten''.&lt;ref&gt;Morley 1938&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yale University]] carried out further investigations from 1984 to 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz de León 2004, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mapping and excavation project was conducted at the site by the La Amelia Archaeological Project in 1997. That work was directed by Dr. Antonia Foias of [[Williams College]]. During the summer 1997 field season, the La Amelia Archaeological Project completed mapping of the central site area and excavated several test units.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==The site==
La Amelia is a small site covering an area of approximately {{convert|0.74|km2|sqmi}}. The site is divided into four groups, two of which have monumental architecture, and a further 13 smaller residential groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz de León 2004, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 mapping project recorded a total of 71 structures at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The central plaza area appears to have been focused around the "Group of the Three Pyramids" in the southern portion of the site. That group included three pyramids of between {{convert|3|and|8|m|ft}} in height, all of which have been severely damaged by looter trenches.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Group of the Hieroglyphic Stairway" is situated {{convert|0.5|km|mi}}north of the main plaza, in the northwest quadrant of the site, and was constructed principally by terracing and flattening the summit of a natural hill.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 1997&lt;/ref&gt; This group exhibits three frontal terraces, and an interior courtyard on the summit which is surrounded by six narrow range structures. Access to the lowest terrace is achieved via a 5-step monolithic stairway featuring limestone blocks carved with glyphs and scenes. Two carved panels (called alternately '''Stela 1''' and '''Panel 2''') originally decorated the front of the structure to either side of the stairway.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monuments===
[[Image:LA AMELIA STEP 7.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Step 7 from the Hieroglyphic Stairway]]
When [[Edwin M. Shook]] of the [[Carnegie Institution]] first documented the site of La Amelia in 1937, he noted the presence of six [[hieroglyphic]] blocks which functioned as risers along the uppermost level of the monolithic stairway.&lt;ref&gt;Morley 1937&lt;/ref&gt; This led him to identify the '''Hieroglyphic Stairway''' at the site, and to name the associated architectural group accordingly. A seventh carved block was recovered in 1997 from a test unit excavated on the plaza immediately southwest of the staircase.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the carved stones from the Hieroglyphic Stairway were entirely glyphic, while the four remaining stones (including the one recovered in 1997) feature reclining male figures along with short texts.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Houston documented one of the three glyphic stones, although no record exists of the other two.&lt;ref&gt;Houston 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Shook sketched the three steps he saw that  depicted human figures, but did not include any details regarding the glyphic texts on those stones.&lt;ref&gt;Morley 1937&lt;/ref&gt; None of the six steps recorded by Shook remained ''[[in situ]]'' by 1997, and their ultimate disposition is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The four carved steps featuring human figures from the Hieroglyphic Stairway at La Amelia all display images of simply-dressed males, who were likely ancestors of the site's ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 1997&lt;/ref&gt; All four of these figures hold heads or masks of [[God K]].  The panel discovered in 1997 included a [[Calendar Round]] date of 2 Caban 2 Muan, and an associated text describing a ritual involving God K which took place on that date. The emblem glyph for the figure on this panel may be that of [[Tamarindito]].&lt;ref&gt;Foias 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The carved panels which originally flanked the Hieroglyphic Stairway at La Amelia depict dancing rulers in full ceremonial costume, as well as glyphic texts. A lower register on each monument depicts a reclining [[jaguar]] which looks up at the dancing ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Morley 1938; Houston 1993&lt;/ref&gt; '''Panel 2''' records a date of AD 804 and depicts the ruler Lachan K'awiil Ajaw Bot dressed as a ballplayer.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000; Zender 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Panel 2 now resides in front of the Mayor's building in Sayaxché. '''Stela 1''' was originally located west of the Hieroglyphic Stairway and records a date of AD 807.&lt;ref&gt;Tourtellot &amp; González 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Stela 1 now resides at the National Museum of Anthropology and Ethnology in [[Guatemala City]].

The question whether the use of language influences [[spatial cognition]] is closely related to theories of [[linguistic relativity]]—also known as the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]—which states that the structure of a language affects cognitive processes of the speaker. Debates about this topic are mainly focused on the extent to which language influences spatial cognition or if it does at all. Research also concerns differences between perspectives on spatial relations across [[cultures]], what these imply, and the exploration of potentially partaking cognitive mechanisms.

==Frames of reference across cultures==
Research shows that frames of reference for spatial cognition differ across cultures and that language could play a crucial role in structuring these different frames.&lt;ref name="Majid, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Majid, Bowerman, Kita, Haun, &amp; Levinson|title=Can language  restructure cognition? The case for space|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=2004|volume=8|issue=3|pages=108–114|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Three types of perspectives on space can be distinguished:&lt;ref name="Majid, 2004"/&gt;
* The '''Relative''' perspective (dominant in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) is dependent on the viewer's position towards the object and often uses descriptions like "the object is to the left/right of ...".
* The '''Absolut''' perspective (found in speakers of [[Arrernte language|Arrernte]], [[Guugu Yimithirr language|Guugu Yimithirr]], [[Kuuk Thaayore]], and [[Tzeltal language|Tzeltal]]) is based on cardinal directions such as north, east, south, and west. Therefore, the description of the location of an object does not change according to the position towards it.
* The '''Intrinsic''' perspective (found in speakers of [[Mopan language|Mopan]] and [[Totonac]]) describes the location of an object without referring to yourself or the use of cardinal directions. Instead it uses the relation towards another object to specify spatial relations (e.g. "the object is at the back/front/side of ...").
Languages like English or Dutch do not exclusively make use of relative descriptions but these appear to be most frequent compared to intrinsic or absolute descriptions. An absolute frame of reference is usually restricted to large scale geographical descriptions in these languages. Speakers of the [[Australian]] languages [[Arrernte language|Arrernte]], [[Guugu Yimithirr language|Guugu Yimithirr]], and [[Kuuk Thaayore]] only use absolute descriptions.&lt;ref name="Majid, 2004" /&gt;
The relative and intrinsic perspectives seem to be connected as there is no known language which applies only one of these frames of reference exclusively.&lt;ref name="Levinson, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levinson|title=Space in Language and Cognition: Explorations in Cognitive Diversity|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pederson, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pederson|title=Spatial Cognition III: Routes and  Navigation, Human Memory and Learning, Spatial Representation and Spatial Learning|date=2003|publisher=Springer Verlag|pages=287–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two views on spatial cognition==
(1.) It has been argued that people universally use an [[egocentric]] representation to solve non-linguistic spatial tasks which would align with the relative frame of reference.&lt;ref name="Wang, 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wang &amp; Spelke|title=Human spatial representation: insights from animals|date=2002|pages=376–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(2.) Other researchers have proposed that people apply multiple frames of reference during their daily lives and that languages reflect these cognitive structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallistel|title=Language and spatial frames of reference in mind and brain|journal=Trends Cogn. Sci.|date=2002|volume=6|pages=321–322|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(02)01962-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the light of the current body of literature the second view seems to be the more plausible one.&lt;ref name="Levinson, 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levinson, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levinson|title=Returning the tables: language affects spatial reasoning|journal=Cognition|date=2002|volume=84|pages=155–188|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(02)00045-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pederson, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pederson|title=Semantic typology and spatial conceptualization|journal=Language|date=1998|volume=74|pages=557–589|doi=10.1353/lan.1998.0074}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wassmann &amp; Dasen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wassmann &amp; Dasen|title=Balinese spatial orientation: some empirical evidence of  moderate linguistic relativity|journal=J. R. Anthropol. Inst|date=1998|volume=4|pages=689–711|doi=10.2307/3034828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directional gestures==
The dominant frames of reference have found to be reflected in the common types of [[gesticulation]] in the respective language.&lt;ref name=McNeill&gt;{{cite book|last1=McNeill|title=Hand and Mind|date=1992|publisher=Chicago University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers of absolute languages would typically represent an object moving north with a hand movement towards the north.&lt;ref name="Haviland, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haviland|title=Anchoring, iconicity, and orientation in GuuguYimithirr pointing  gestures|journal=J. Linguist. Anthropol.|date=1993|volume=3|pages=3–45|doi=10.1525/jlin.1993.3.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haviland, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haviland|title=Guugu Yimithirr cardinal directions|journal=Ethos|date=1998|volume=26|pages=25–47|doi=10.1525/eth.1998.26.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas speakers of relative languages typically depict a movement of an object to the right with a hand movement to the right, independent of the direction they are facing during speech.&lt;ref name="Kita, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kita &amp; Özyürek|title=What does cross-linguistic variation in semantic coordination  of speech and gesture reveal? Evidence for an interface representation of spatial thinking and speaking|journal=J. Mem. Lang.|date=2003|volume=48|pages=16–32|doi=10.1016/s0749-596x(02)00505-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers of intrinsic languages would, for example, typically represent human movement from the perspective of the mover with a [[sagittal]] hand gesture away from the speaker.&lt;ref name="kita, 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kita|title=Cultural speciﬁcity of spatial schemas as manifested in spontaneous  gestures|date=2001|publisher=MIT Press|pages=115–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The spatial representation of time==
A study by Boroditsky and Gaby&lt;ref name="Boroditsky, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boroditsky &amp; Gaby|title=Remembrances of times east: Absolute spatial  representations of time in an aboriginal Australian community|journal=Psychological Science|date=2010|volume=21|pages=1635–1639|doi=10.1177/0956797610386621|pmid=20959511}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared speakers of an absolute language—[[Pormpuraawans]]—with English speakers. The task on which they compared them consisted of the spatial arrangement of cards which showed a temporal progression. The result was that the speakers of the relative language (Americans) exclusively chose to represent time spatially as progressing from left (earlier time) to right (later time). Whereas the [[Pormpuraawans]] took the direction they faced into account and preferred to depict time as progressing from east (earlier time) to west (later time) the most.

==Third variables==
[[Confounding variables]] could potentially explain a significant proportion of the measured difference in performance between the linguistic frames of reference. 
These can be categorized into three types of confounding factors:
* '''Environmental factors''' (e.g. rural vs. urban or open terrain vs. dense forest) could influence linguistic and non-linguistic categories.&lt;ref name="Li, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li &amp; Gleitman|title=Turning the tables: language and spatial reasoning|journal=Cognition|date=2002|volume=83|pages=265–294|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(02)00009-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindsey, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindsey &amp; Brown|title=Color naming and the phototoxic effects of sunlight on  the eye|journal=Psychol. Sci.|date=2002|volume=13|pages=506–512|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00489}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Global cognitive styles''' (e.g. [[individualism]] vs. [[collectivism]]) could act as a [[:wikt:mediator|mediator]] between language and cognition.&lt;ref name="Greenfield, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenﬁeld|title=Cultural pathways through universal development|journal=Annu. Rev. Psychol.|date=2003|volume=54|pages=461–490}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Differences in habitual action''' (could be reflected in subsistence patterns) might shape the differing use of frames of reference in language and cognition.&lt;ref name=Gallistel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallistel|title=Conception, perception and the control of action. Reply to Majid.|journal=Trends Cogn. Sci.|date=2002|volume=6|page=504|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(02)02033-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The importance of language for cognition===
Gentner, Özyürek, Gürcanli, and Goldin-Meadow&lt;ref name="Gentner, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gentner, Özyürek, Gürcanli, and Goldin-Meadow|title=Spatial language  facilitates spatial cognition: Evidence from children who lack language input|journal=Cognition|date=2013|volume=127|issue=3|pages=318–330|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2013.01.003|pmid=23542409|pmc=3708650}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that deaf children, who lacked a conventional language, did not use gestures to convey spatial relations (see [[home sign]]). Building on that, they showed that deaf children performed significantly worse on a task of spatial cognition compared to hearing children. They concluded that the acquisition of (spatial) language is an important factor in shaping spatial cognition.

==Cognitive mechanisms==
Several mechanisms accounting for or contributing to the possible effect of language on cognition have been suggested: 
*'''Perceptual tuning and attention''': Experience (with language) can direct habitual attention so that perception becomes more oriented towards particular features in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstone|title=Perceptual learning|journal=Annu. Rev. Psychol.|date=1998|volume=49|pages=585–612|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sloutsky|title=The role of similarity in the development of categorization|journal=Trends Cogn. Sci.|date=2003|volume=7|pages=246–251|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00109-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[The novice-expert shift]]''': Increased experience in a specific domain can lead to a recoding of representational units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bailenson|title=A bird’s eye view: biological categorization and reasoning within  and across cultures.|journal=Cognition|date=2002|volume=84|pages=1–53|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(02)00011-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|title=Cultural and experiential differences in the development of folkbiological  induction|journal=Cogn. Dev.|date=2003|volume=18|pages=25–47|doi=10.1016/s0885-2014(02)00142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Structure-mapping''': When comparing conceptual representations based on similarities, language can influence what tends to be compared to what by promoting the saliency of specific categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowerman &amp; Choi|title=Space under construction: language-speciﬁc spatial  categorization in ﬁrst language acquisition|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|pages=387–427}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gentner|title=Why we’re so smart|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|pages=195–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Costs of computation''': Based on the assumption of language promoting the formation of different categories, it would result that the cognitive effort to access the more salient frame of reference in the respective language (relative, absolute or intrinsic) is lower in comparison to switching to another frame.&lt;ref name="Levinson, 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunt &amp; Agnoli|title=The Whorﬁan hypothesis: a cognitive psychology perspective|journal=Psychol.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9358">The official '''language of Illinois''' is [[English language|English]]. Nearly 80% of the population speak English natively, and most others speak it fluently as a second language. The forms of [[American English]] spoken in [[Illinois]] range from [[Inland Northern American English|Inland Northern]] near Chicago and the northern part of the state, to [[Midland American English|Midland]] and [[Southern American English|Southern]] dialects further [[Downstate Illinois|downstate]].  Illinois has speakers of many other languages, of which [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is by far the most widespread. Illinois's indigenous languages disappeared when the Indian population was deported under the policy of [[Indian Removal]].

==Official language==
English is Illinois's [[official language]]. Illinois was one of the first states in America to pass an official language law, though its first official language was not English but "American".  In 1923, Representative [[Washington J. McCormick]] of [[Montana]] had failed to pass a bill in the United States Congress declaring "American" to be the official language of the United States.  Following the bill's failure, Senator Frank Ryan introduced a similar bill to the [[Illinois General Assembly]].  The bill passed with the support of Irish and Jewish politicians in [[Chicago]], who, by rejecting the term "English", wanted to show their opposition to British policies in [[Ireland]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/faculty/debaron/essays/langlaw.htm |title=Language Laws and Related Court Decisions |last1=Baron |first1=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Baron |date=n.d. |website=Dennis Baron: Professor of English and linguistics  |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] Department of English |accessdate=30 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, another act of the General Assembly replaced "American" with "English."  Meanwhile, the term "American language" survives in some legislation from the period.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{ILCS|225|705|27.01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike [[English-only movement|official language laws]] in many other states, the statute in Illinois is purely symbolic, having the same status as laws naming [[List of Illinois state symbols|state symbols]] like the state bird and state fossil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baron |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Baron |year=2001 |chapter=Language Legislation and Language Abuse: American Language Policy through the 1990s |editor1-last=Dueñas González |editor1-first=Roseann |editor2-last=Melis |editor2-first=Ildikó |title=Language Ideologies: Critical Perspectives on the Official English Movement |volume=2: History, Theory, and Policy |location=Mahwah, New Jersey |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |isbn=0-8058-4054-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dce2AgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects of English==
The English of Illinois varies from [[Inland Northern American English|Inland Northern]] in the northern part of the state, to [[Midland American English|Midland]] and [[Southern American English|Southern]] further south.  The [[Northern Cities Vowel Shift]] is advanced in Chicago and its vicinity, and some features of the shift can be heard along The St. Louis Corridor, a southwestern extension of the NCVS stretching from the Chicago area to [[St. Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/Events/PLC/plc36/abstracts/Friedman_PLC36.pdf |title=A Northern Cities Shift Retreat in the St. Louis Corridor |last1=Friedman |first1=Lauren |year=2012 |website=36th Annual Penn Linguistics Colloquium |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]] |accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distribution of dialect features reflects the origins of early English-speaking settlers: Inland Northern predominates in areas first settled by people from [[New England]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Germany]]; Midland and Southern are spoken in areas settled by people from the [[southern United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frazer |first=Timothy C. |year=2007 |title=Tongue ties: The linguistic map of western Illinois |url=http://www.lib.niu.edu/2007/ih070512.html |journal=Illinois Heritage |publisher=[[Illinois State Historical Society]] |location=Springfield |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=12–15 |accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[African American Vernacular English]] is also spoken in parts of the state.

==Other languages==
As of 2010, 78.26% (9,315,206) of Illinois residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a [[primary language]], while 12.74% (1,516,674) spoke [[Spanish language|Spanish]], 1.64% (195,600) [[Polish language|Polish]], 0.67% (80,954) [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (which includes [[Cantonese]] and [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]), and 0.64% (75,754) [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. In total, 21.74% (2,587,254) of Illinois's population age 5 and older spoke a [[mother language]] other than English.&lt;ref name=MLAData&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/cgi-shl/docstudio/docs.pl?map_data_results |title=Illinois |publisher=[[Modern Language Association]] |accessdate=August 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815140430/http://www.mla.org/cgi-shl/docstudio/docs.pl?map_data_results |archivedate=August 15, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among those who speak a language other than English at home, most (57.3%) were reported in 2010 to speak English "very well."  20.7% spoke English "well," 15.9% spoke it "not well," and only 6.2% "not at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acs-22.pdf |title=Language Use in the United States: American Community Survey Reports |last1=Ryan |first1=Camille |date=August 2013 |website=Census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=30 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the colonial period, the [[Miami-Illinois language]] was spoken throughout the territory of the modern state. [[Jacques Gravier]], a missionary at [[Starved Rock]], wrote the first French-Illinois dictionary in 1700; Jean Le Boullenger wrote another in 1725.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/muslink/nat_amer/post/htmls/id_lang.html |title=The Illinois Identity: Language |year= 2000|website=MuseumLink Illinois |publisher=Illinois State Museum |accessdate=30 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other indigenous languages at the time of statehood in 1818 included [[Potawatomi language|Potawatomi]], [[Fox language|Sauk-Fox]], and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]].  These languages disappeared from Illinois when the U.S. carried out [[Indian Removal]], culminating in the [[Black Hawk War]] of 1832 and the [[Treaty of Chicago#1833 Treaty of Chicago|Second Treaty of Chicago]] in 1833.

[[French language|French]] was the language of [[Illinois Country|colonial Illinois]] before 1763, and under British rule remained the most-spoken language in the main settlements of [[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia]] and [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]].  Many French speakers left Illinois after it came under U.S. control following the [[Illinois Campaign]] of 1778, but Illinois was still a bilingual territory for several more years before the flood of Anglo-American settlers overwhelmed the old communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boggess |first=Arthur Clinton |year=1908 |title=The Settlement of Illinois 1778-1830 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34049/34049-pdf.pdf |location=Chicago |publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]] |page=50 |isbn= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516010101/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34049/34049%2Dpdf.pdf|archivedate=2010 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=30 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of statehood in 1818, French was in decline for matters of politics and government.&lt;ref&gt;Boggess, 135&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial French died out in Illinois but survived as [[Missouri French]] in some communities across the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Connor |first=Rorye |date=15 November 2012 |title=French still thrives in the Illinois territory |url=http://www.register-news.com/x1988173620/French-still-thrives-in-the-Illinois-territory |journal=[[Mt.

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) [[World Heritage site]]s are places of importance to [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage]] as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972.&lt;ref name=convention&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ |title=The World Heritage Convention |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brazil|Federative Republic of Brazil]] accepted the convention on 1 September 1977, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2017, there are 21 World Heritage sites in Brazil, including fourteen cultural sites and seven natural sites.&lt;ref name=brazil&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/br/ |title=Brazil |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first site in Brazil, the [[Ouro Preto|Historic Town of Ouro Preto]], was inscribed on the list at the 4th Session of the [[World Heritage Committee]], held in [[Paris]], [[France]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom80.htm#124 |title= Report of the Rapporteur|publisher=UNESCO |date=29 September 1980 |accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, [[Jesuit Missions]] of the [[Guaraní people|Guaranis]] was accepted to the list in a joint bid with [[Argentina]], making it Brazil's first trans-border property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom83.htm#275 |title=Report of the 7th Session of the Committee |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iguaçu National Park]] was enlisted in 1986 as the first site selected for its natural significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom86.htm#355 |title=Report of the 10th Session of the Committee |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil's latest contribution to the World Heritage List, the [[Valongo Wharf|Valongo Wharf Archaeological Site]], was inscribed in 2017.&lt;ref name=valongo/&gt;

In addition to its inscribed sites, Brazil also maintains twenty-three properties on its tentative list.&lt;ref name=braziltent/&gt;

Hudson, [http://michaelchudson.com/about/ "About"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
While conducting fieldwork in Lebanon for his doctoral dissertation, Hudson taught history at the American Community School in Beirut from 1962-1963. Also while completing his doctoral degree, he served as an instructor at Swarthmore College, from 1963-1964. Upon completing his studies at Yale University, Hudson became Assistant Professor at [[Brooklyn College]] at the [[City University of New York]], from 1964-1968, and then an Associate Professor (tenured), from 1968-1970. In 1970, he became Associate Professor in the [[School of Advanced International Studies]] (SAIS) at the [[Johns Hopkins University]]. He remained at SAIS until 1975, when he co-founded the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies (CCAS) at Georgetown University with a distinguished group of academics, including [[Hisham Sharabi]], John Ruedy, [[Ibrahim Oweiss]], Ambassador Clovis Maksoud, and Dean [[Peter F. Krogh]]. Hudson served as the director of CCAS from 1976-1989, and directed it again in 2000, 2003-2006, and 2007-2010.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Contemporary Arab Studies [http://www.mei.nus.edu.sg/about-mei/staff/research "Academics"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Hudson became the Director of the Middle East Institute (MEI) and Professor of Political Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Hudson was the first director of MEI, which was founded in 2007 as an autonomous research institute within NUS. He continues to direct MEI today. Hudson is also Professor Emeritus at Georgetown University.&lt;ref&gt;Middle East Institute, National University of Singapore [http://www.mei.nus.edu.sg/about-mei/staff/research "About MEI"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, he was appointed as the Kuwait Foundation Visiting Scholar at Harvard Kennedy School's [http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/project/64/middle_east_initiative.html Middle East Initiative]. He is leading a study group at the Kennedy School on "Rethinking the Arab State: The Collapse of Legitimacy in Arab Politics." &lt;ref&gt;[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/project/64/middle_east_initiative.html "Middle East Initiative"]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the course of his career, Hudson has served on numerous boards and committees related to the fields of political science and Middle East studies. He was a founding member of the [[Middle East Studies Association of North America]], and served as President of the association from 1986-87. He has served on the editorial boards of the International Journal of Middle East Studies, the Journal of Arab Affairs, and Cambridge University Press's "Middle East Library" series.

In addition to his distinguished record of establishing and directing premier centers for Middle East studies (CCAS and MEI), Hudson has been an authoritative scholar of contemporary Middle East politics. His most notable contributions are on the problem of political legitimacy in the Arab world, as set out in his seminal work ''Arab Politics: The Search for Legitimacy''.&lt;ref&gt;''Arab Politics: The Search for Legitimacy''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; He has identified and explored the legitimacy 'deficits' of various Arab governments, focusing on cultural, institutional, and leadership sources of legitimacy. He argues that the question of participation is key to legitimacy, an issue borne out by the Arab uprisings beginning in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;“Awakening, Cataclysm, or Just a Series of Events?  Reflections on the Current Wave of Protest in the Arab World,” in ''The Dawn of the Arab Uprisings: End of an Old Order?'' edited by Bassam Haddad, Rosie Bsheer and Ziad Abu-Rish, London: Pluto Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, new information technologies and social media have invigorated civil societies in these countries.&lt;ref&gt;For example: “Information Technology, International Politics and Political Change in the Arab World,” ''Bulletin of the Royal Institute for Inter-Faith Studies'' (Amman, Jordan) 4:2 (Autumn/Winter 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hudson has also contributed to the scholarship on politics in divided societies, U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, and regional integration and conflict in the Middle East. On politics in divided societies, he has taken Lebanon as an ongoing case study (see his book ''The Precarious Republic''), critiquing the theory of consociationalism and advocating the deconstruction rather than the institutionalization of sectarianism in Lebanon and elsewhere in the region, despite the recent apparent resurgence of sectarian polarization.&lt;ref&gt;''The Precarious Republic: Political Modernization in Lebanon'', New York: Random House, 1968; a publication of the Harvard Center for International Affairs; reissued with new preface in 1985 by Westview Press, Boulder, CO.&lt;/ref&gt; On U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, Hudson contends that a [[Pax Americana]] for the Middle East is illusory, owing to the U.S.'s unbalanced approach to the Palestine-Israel conflict, the negative consequences of military interventions, and the failure to maintain [[soft power]] and capitalize on a legacy of good will.&lt;ref&gt;For example: “To Play the Hegemon: Fifty Years of US Policy Toward the Middle East.” ''Middle East Journal'', 50:3 (Summer 1996): 329-43.&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts that "Imperial America" has been driven by dysfunctional domestic pressures and poor decision-making, and has lately suggested that the so-called "American decline" in the Middle East might not be a bad thing for all concerned. Dealing with questions of regional integration and conflict in the greater Middle East, Hudson has explored the interplay between 'rationalist' classical international relations theory approaches and 'sociological' approaches that focus on the domestic decision-making arena.&lt;ref&gt;For example: “Rethinking Political Culture Explanations of Arab Authoritarianism and Democratization,” in ''Political Liberalization and Democratization in the Arab World: Theoretical Perspectives'', edited by Bahgat Korany, Paul Noble, and Rex Brynen, Boulder: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced in his academic training by [[Kenneth Waltz]] on the one hand and [[Karl W. Deutsch]] on the other, Hudson has argued against theoretical stovepiping; understanding integrative and conflict tendencies requires acknowledgement of Waltz's 'third image' approach as well as Deutsch's 'social mobilization approach.'&lt;ref&gt;For example: “Social Mobilization Theory and Arab Politics," in ''From National Development to Global Community: Essays in Honor of Karl W. Deutsch'', edited by Richard L. Merritt and Bruce M. Russett, London: Allen and Unwin, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a professor at Georgetown University and elsewhere, Hudson has taught courses on comparative politics, international politics, comparative politics of the Middle East, Middle East international politics, Lebanese politics, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict, an introduction to social science, networked cultures and networked politics, Yemeni politics, U.S. policy in the Middle East, and politics in divided societies. Hudson is frequently consulted by news organizations for interviews and guest appearances to discuss political developments in the Middle East. Furthermore, he regularly contributes to the media through opinion editorials and short essays. Some of these outlets include ''Al-Jazeera English'', ''Jadaliyya'', ''Foreign Policy'', Singapore's ''Middle East Insights'', ''The Washington Post'', Lebanon's ''The Daily Star'' and ''Al-Mustaqbal'', the ''International Herald Tribune'', and others.&lt;ref&gt;List of op-eds [http://michaelchudson.com/media-opinion/ "Media and Opinion"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Hudson's academic work has been supported by competitive grants and fellowships. These have included the Robert R. McCormick Fellowship from Yale University (1959–62), American Philosophical Society grants (1965 and 1968), the Harvard Center for International Affairs Fellowship (1965–66), a Guggenheim Fellowship (1975–76), and a Fulbright Senior Fellowship to Yemen in 1994. He has also been the recipient of various honors and awards for his academic and administrative contributions to Middle East studies, including the "Jere L. Bacharach Service Award" from the Middle East Studies Association in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Middle East Studies Association [http://www.mesa.arizona.edu/awards/jere-bacharach-service.html#previous "Jere L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8120">The '''Monarchomachs''' ({{lang-fr|Monarchomaques}}) were originally [[Early Modern France|French]] [[Huguenot]] [[political theory|theorists]] who opposed [[monarchism|monarchy]] at the end of the 16th century, known in particular for having theoretically justified [[tyrannicide]]. The term was originally a pejorative word coined in 1600 by the Scottish royalist and Catholic [[William Barclay (jurist)|William Barclay]] (1548–1608) from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] μόναρχος (''monarchos'' {{spaced ndash}} "monarch, sole ruler") and μάχομαι ("makhomai" {{spaced ndash}} the verb meaning "to fight"), meaning "those who fight against monarchs".

Born out of the [[French Wars of Religion]], they were most active between 1573, a year after the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], and 1584. The Monarchomachs pleaded in favour of a form of "[[popular sovereignty]]". Arguing for a sort of contract between the sovereign and the people, they have been considered as the precursors of [[social contract]] theories.&lt;ref name=Gallica&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/themes/PolXVI6.htm Les Monarchomaques], ''[[Gallica]]'' {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory of tyrannicide ==

The Monarchomachs included jurists such as the Calvinists [[François Hotman]] (1524–1590), [[Théodore de Bèze]] (1519–1605), [[Simon Goulart]] (1543–1628), [[Nicolas Barnaud]] (1538–1604), [[Hubert Languet]] (1518–1581), [[Philippe de Mornay]] (1549–1623) and [[George Buchanan]] (1506–1582). Through the means of [[libel (poetry)|libels]] and theoretical tracts, they revived the doctrine of the [[tyrannicide]]. It had been opposed during the [[Middle Ages]] by the "legists" (jurists who theorized the royal power) who attempted to reserve the title of [[tyrant]] to those who tried to overturn the ruling monarch. Legists thus ended up legitimizing, under the name of "tyrannicide", the assassinations of political opponents ordered by the monarch.

Monarchomachs considered that the end of the [[Sovereign state|state]] was prosperity of the whole social group, as the true sovereign, granting effective practice of power to the king, whose authority remained of [[divine right of king|divine right]].&lt;ref name=Gallica/&gt; Exercise of popular sovereignty was to be delegated to the magistrates and the officers of the crown. They considered that the people were a collective body, possessed of a specific wisdom, which allowed them to understand better than the king the common good, distinct from the interest of each of its parties. Assimilated to the medieval ''[[wikt:universitas|universitas'',]] the people was thus considered as a legal subject, whose interests were represented by the [[French States-General|General Estates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memo.fr/dossier.asp?ID=1011 Memo.fr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070507125351/http://www.memo.fr/dossier.asp?ID=1011 |date=2007-05-07 }} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://multitudes.samizdat.net/Un-pouvoir-constituant-pour-libres.html Un pouvoir constituant... pour libres professeurs ?] (on the book of Jean Fabien Spitz, ''[[John Locke]] et les fondements de la liberté moderne''), by François Matheron, ''[[Multitudes]]'', June 2002 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conception of the magistrates and the association of wise people as best representants of the people separated them from modern conception of [[democracy]], as they restricted effective power to a minority. [[Max Weber]] considered them in his lecture ''[[Politics as a Vocation]]'' as participants of the movement of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] of law in Europe. 

The Monarchomachs also claimed that if the sovereign persecuted true religion, he would violate the contract concluded between God and the people, who were thus granted a [[right of rebellion]]. They were inspired by [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the [[School of Salamanca]] on the killing of "bad kings". This legimitization of tyrannicide may have inspired as much the [[Jacques Clément|friar Clément]], who assassinated [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] in 1589, as [[François Ravaillac|Ravaillac]], who assassinated [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] in 1610.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/litteraire/20061130.FIG000000196_jacques_clement_avant_ravaillac.html Jacques Clément avant Ravaillac], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 30 November 2006 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebellion against tyranny was considered not only as necessary, but as a divine right.

== Monarchomach theory in the 16th century ==

The term ''Monarchomachs'' was coined by [[William Barclay (jurist)|William Barclay]]&lt;ref name=Skinner&gt;[[Quentin Skinner]], ''The Foundations of Modern Political Thought'', Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''De Regno et Regali Potestate'' (About the Powers of Authority and Royalty), published in 1600. Barclay's theory was that the Huguenots had lost their struggle with the Catholic Church and were turning their battle towards the government to undermine the king's support of the Catholics. Eventually, the term was used to classify anyone who was opposed to the king's rule. 

At first a Protestant doctrine, the notion of tyrannicide was reappropriated by the Catholics when Protestants came to be kings. It was then used in [[French Revolution|revolutionary]] discourses during the debates concerning the execution of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], while the right of rebellion was included in the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]. 

Influenced by the Huguenots, some British thinkers also embraced the Monarchomaque movement.

[[Image:Meister des Rasikapriyâ-Manuskripts 001.jpg|thumb|17th-century Mughal painting]]
[[File:Mansurtulip.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Ustad Mansur]] (fl.&amp;nbsp;1590-1624), who came to prominence during the reign of Jahangir]]
'''Mughal painting''' is that particular style of South Asian painting which generally confines  [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] either as book illustrations or as single works to be kept in albums, which emerged from [[Persian miniature]] painting (itself largely of [[Chinese painting|Chinese origin]]), with Indian Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist influences, and developed largely in the court of the [[Mughal Empire]] of the 16th to 18th centuries. 

Mughal paintings later spread to other Indian courts, both Muslim and Hindu, and later Sikh. The mingling of foreign Persian and indigenous Indian elements was a continuation of the patronisation of other aspects of foreign culture as initiated by the earlier Turko-Afghan [[Delhi Sultanate]], and the introduction of it into the subcontinent by various Central Asian Turkic dynasties, such as the [[Ghaznavids]].

==Origins==
This art of painting developed as a blending of Persian and Indian ideas. There was already a Muslim tradition of miniature painting under the Turko-Afghan Sultanate of Delhi which the Mughals overthrew, and like the Mughals, and the very earliest of Central Asian invaders into the subcontinent, patronized foreign culture. Although the first surviving manuscripts are from [[Mandu, Madhya Pradesh|Mandu]] in the years either side of 1500, there were very likely earlier ones which are either lost, or perhaps now attributed to southern Persia, as later manuscripts can be hard to distinguish from these by style alone, and some remain the subject of debate among specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 161-166&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of the Mughal invasion, the tradition had abandoned the high viewpoint typical of the Persian style, and adopted a more realistic style for animals and plants.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

No miniatures survive from the reign of the founder of the dynasty, [[Babur]], nor does he mention commissioning any in his diaries, the ''[[Baburnama]]''.  Copies of this were illustrated by his descendents, Akbar in particular, with many portraits of the many new animals Babur encountered when he invaded India, which are carefully described.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 187&lt;/ref&gt;  However some surviving un-illustrated manuscripts may have been commissioned by him, and he comments on the style of some famous past Persian masters.  Some older illustrated manuscripts have his seal on them; the Mughals came from a long line stretching back to [[Timur]] and were fully assimilated into [[Persianate]] culture, and expected to patronize literature and the arts.

Mughal painting immediately took a much greater interest in realistic portraiture than was typical of Persian miniatures.  Animals and plants were also more realistically shown.  Although many classic works of [[Persian literature]] continued to be illustrated, as well as Indian works, the taste of the Mughal emperors for writing memoirs or diaries, begun by Babur, provided some of the most lavishly decorated texts, such as the [[Padshahnama]] genre of official histories.  Subjects are rich in variety and include portraits, events and scenes from court life, wild life and hunting scenes, and illustrations of battles.  The Persian tradition of richly decorated borders framing the central image was continued.

The style of the Mughal school developed within the royal [[atelier]]. Knowledge was primarily transmitted through familial and apprenticeship relationships, and the system of joint manuscript production which brought multiple artists together for single works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sensiblereason.com/artistic-stylistic-transmission-in-the-royal-mughal-atelier/|title=Artistic Stylistic Transmission in the Royal Mughal Atelier|first=Greg|last=Sarafan|date=6 November 2011|publisher=Sensible Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the second Mughal emperor, [[Humayun]] was in exile in [[Tabriz]] in the [[Safavid]] court of [[Shah Tahmasp I]] of Persia, he was exposed to Persian miniature painting, and commissioned at least one work there, an unusually large painting of ''Princes of the House of Timur'', now in the [[British Museum]].  When Humayun returned to India, he brought two accomplished Persian artists [[Abd al-Samad]] and [[Mir Sayyid Ali]] with him.  His usurping brother [[Kamran Mirza]] had maintained a workshop in [[Kabul]], which Humayan perhaps took over into his own.  Humayan's major known commission was a ''[[Khamsa of Nizami]]'' with 36 illuminated pages, in which the different styles of the various artists are mostly still apparent.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the London painting, he also commissioned at least two miniatures showing himself with family members,&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; a type of subject that was rare in Persia but was to be common among the Mughals.&lt;ref&gt;Beach, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Mughal painting developed and flourished during the reigns of [[Akbar]], [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]].

===Akbar (1556-1605)===
During the reign of Humayun's son [[Akbar]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1556-1605), the imperial court, apart from being the centre of administrative authority to manage and rule the vast Mughal empire, also emerged as a centre of cultural excellence. Akbar inherited and expanded his father's library and atelier of court painters, and paid close personal attention to its output. He had studied painting in his youth under [[Abd as-Samad]], though it is not clear how far these studies went.&lt;ref&gt;Beach, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1560 and 1566 the ''[[Tutinama]]'' ("Tales of a Parrot"), now in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] was illustrated, showing "the stylistic components of the imperial Mughal style at a formative stage".&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among other manuscripts, between 1562 and 1577 the atelier worked on an illustrated manuscript of the ''[[Hamzanama]]'' consisting of 1,400 canvas [[Bookbinding|folio]]s. [[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]]'s masterpiece The ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]'' was produced at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in 1582, a ''[[Darab Nama]]'' around 1585; the [[Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208)]] followed in the 1590s and [[Jami]]'s ''Baharistan'' around 1595 in [[Lahore]]. As Mughal-derived painting spread to [[Hindu]] courts the texts illustrated included the Hindu [[Epic poetry|epic]]s including the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]; themes with animal fables; individual portraits; and paintings on scores of different themes.  Mughal style during this period continued to refine itself with elements of realism and naturalism coming to the fore. Between the years of 1570 to 1585 Akbar hired over a one hundred painters to practice Mughal style painting.&lt;ref&gt;Eastman&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jahangir (1605–25)===
[[Jahangir]] had an artistic inclination and during his reign Mughal painting developed further.  Brushwork became finer and the colors lighter. Jahangir was also deeply influenced by European painting. During his reign he came into direct contact with the English Crown and was sent gifts of oil paintings, which included portraits of the King and Queen. He encouraged his royal atelier to take up the single point perspective favoured by European artists, unlike the flattened multi-layered style used in traditional miniatures. He particularly encouraged paintings depicting events of his own life, individual portraits, and studies of birds, flowers and animals. The ''[[Jahangirnama]]'', written during his lifetime, which is an autobiographical account of Jahangir's reign, has several paintings, including some unusual subjects such as the union of a saint with a tigress, and fights between spiders.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;!-- possible, Thackston 1999 p. xvii says it included a painting between a snake and a spider Lionel Messi The Best Of All Time --&gt;

===Shah Jahan (1628–59)===
During the reign of [[Shah Jahan]] (1628–58), Mughal paintings continued to develop, but court paintings became more rigid and formal. The illustrations from the "Padshanama" (chronicle of the King of the world), one of the finest Islamic manuscripts from the Royal Collection, at Windsor, were painted during the reign of Shah Jahan. Written in Persian on paper that is flecked with gold, has exquisitely rendered paintings. The "Padshahnama" has portraits of the courtiers and servants of the King painted with great detail and individuality. In keeping with the strict formality at court, however the portraits of the King and important nobles was rendered in strict profile, whereas servants and common people, depicted with individual features have been portrayed in the three -quarter view or the frontal view. 
Themes including musical parties; lovers, sometimes in intimate positions, on terraces and gardens; and ascetics gathered around a fire, abound in the Mughal paintings of this period.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Later paintings==
[[Aurangzeb]] (1658-1707) did not actively encourage Mughal paintings, but as this art form had gathered momentum and had a number of patrons, Mughal paintings continued to survive, but the decline had set in.  Some sources however note that a few of the best Mughal paintings were made for Aurangzeb, speculating that they believed that he was about to close the workshops and thus exceeded themselves in his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1600_1699/aurangzeb/darbarscene/darbarscene.html Commentary]  by [[Stuart Cary Welch]]&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a brief revival during the reign of [[Muhammad Shah]] 'Rangeela' (1719–48), but by the time of [[Shah Alam II]] (1759–1806), the art of Mughal painting had lost its glory. By that time, other schools of Indian painting had developed, including, in the royal courts of the Rajput kingdoms of [[Rajputana]], [[Rajput painting]] and in the cities ruled by the [[British East India Company]], the [[Company style]] under Western influence.  Late Mughal style often shows increased use of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and recession under Western influence.

The Persian master artists [[Abd al-Samad]] and [[Mir Sayyid Ali]], who had accompanied [[Humayun]] to India in the 16th century, were in charge of the imperial atelier during the formative stages of Mughal painting.  Many artists worked on large commissions, the majority of them apparently Hindu, to judge by the names recorded.  Mughal painting flourished during the late 16th and early 17th centuries with spectacular works of art by master artists such as [[Basawan]], Lal, [[Daswanth]],&lt;ref&gt;Diamind, Maurice. [http://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257529.pdf.bannered.pdf "Mughal Painting Under Akbar the Great"] Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Miskin (Mughal painter)|Miskin]]. Another influence on the evolution of style during Akbar's reign was [[Kesu Das]], who understood and developed "European techniques of rendering space and volume".&lt;ref name="BloomBlair2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Jonathan M.|last2=Blair|first2=Sheila S.|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA380|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|volume=1|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Govardhan (Mughal painter)|Govardhan]] was a noted painter during the reigns of Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan.

The sub-imperial school of Mughal painting included artists such as [[Mushfiq]], Kamal, and Fazl.

During the first half of the 18th century, many Mughal-trained artists left the imperial workshop to work at Rajput courts. These include artists such as Bhawanidas and his son [[Dalchand]].

Mughal painting generally involved a group of artists, one to decide the composition, the second to actually paint, and the third to focus on portraiture, executing individual faces.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mughal style today==
Mughal-style miniature paintings are still being created today by a small number of artists in Lahore concentrated mainly in the National College of Arts. Although many of these miniatures are skillful copies of the originals, some artists have produced contemporary works using classic methods with, at times, remarkable artistic effect.

The skills needed to produce these modern versions of Mughal miniatures are still passed on from generation to generation, although many artisans also employ dozens of workers, often painting under trying working conditions, to produce works sold under the signature of their modern masters.

'''Onondaga Nation Language''' ('''Onoñdaʔgegáʔ nigaweñoʔdeñʔ''' ({{IPA-iro|onũdaʔɡeɡáʔ niɡawẽnoʔdẽʔ|IPA}}, literally "Onondaga is our language") is the language of the [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]] [[First Nation]], one of the original five constituent tribes of the League of the [[Iroquois]] (Haudenosaunee).

This language is spoken in the United States and Canada, primarily on the reservation in central [[New York state]], and near [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]], [[Ontario]].

== Usage and revitalization ==
The Onondaga Nation Language Center (called ''Ne' Eñhadiweñnayeñde'nha''', or "they will get to know the language") has been engaged in language revitalization efforts since 2010. Children learn the Onondaga language at Onondaga Nation School, and classes are also available for adults. In September 2015, it was announced that fifteen adults would enter a full-time language immersion class in Onondaga, after which they would become teachers of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Onondaga Nation's urgent mission: Saving our language|url = http://www.syracuse.com/empire/index.ssf/2015/09/onondaga_nation_leaders_members_work_to_revitalize_their_language.html|accessdate = 2015-10-03|date = September 13, 2015|website = Syracuse.com|last = Moses|first = Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
This table shows the (consonant) [[phonemes]] that are found in Onondaga.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|+Consonant phonemes
!

The two [[Plosive consonant|plosive]]s, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} are [[allophone|allophonically]] voiced to {{IPA|[d]}} and {{IPA|[ɡ]}} before vowels and [[resonants]] (the bottom row of the chart labelled 'sonorant') and are spelled {{angle bracket|d}} and {{angle bracket|g}} in this case. There is considerable palatalization and affrication in the language.

Onondaga has five [[oral vowel]]s, {{IPA|/i e o æ a/}} ({{IPA|/æ/}} is sometimes represented orthographically as {{angle bracket|ä}}), and two [[nasal vowel]]s, {{IPA|/ẽ/}} and {{IPA|/ũ/}}. The nasal vowels, following the Iroquoianist tradition, are spelled with [[ogonek]]s in the scholarly literature and in Ontario ({{angle bracket|ę}} and {{angle bracket|ǫ}} or {{angle bracket|ų}}). In New York, they are represented with a following {{angle bracket|ñ}} ({{angle bracket|eñ}} and {{angle bracket|oñ}}). Vowels can be both short and long. When vowel length derives from the now lost consonant *r, it is phonemic. Vowel length is written with a following colon, {{angle bracket|:}} or raised dot {{angle bracket|·}}.

==Morphology==
Onondaga is a [[polysynthetic]] language, exhibiting a great deal of inflectional and derivational morphology on the verbal forms (including [[noun incorporation]]). Nominal forms have less morphology. Additionally, there are particles, which are monomorphemic.

===Verbal morphology===
Onondaga verbs can be divided into three main classes according to their aspectual properties (discussed below). These are the active verbs, motion verbs, and stative verbs. We must distinguish between tense and aspect. [[Grammatical tense|Tense]] refers to when the event takes place, either in the past, the present or the future. [[Grammatical aspect|Aspect]] refers to the event itself, such as whether it is finished or ongoing or occurs repeatedly. 

There are four aspects in Onondaga. The first is the habitual aspect (HAB). This aspect is used to refer to an event that takes place repeatedly or on an ongoing basis. The second is the punctual aspect (PUNC) (also known as perfective aspect). This aspect refers to an entire event in its completeness. When used in the past tense, the event is described as “over and done-with.” It cannot describe an event that is interrupted or incomplete. The third aspect is the stative (STAT) (also known as imperfective) refers to an event that is ongoing or incomplete or, if it occurs in the past tense, that has some bearing on the present. Finally, there is the purposive aspect (PURP), which refers to imminent action and usually implies intent or volition on the part of the subject. Active verbs can appear with any of the first three aspects. Motion verbs can appear with any of all four aspects. Stative verbs can only appear with the stative aspect.

====Verbal template====

A typical Onondaga verb consists of several morphemes (components). The following chart outlines the order of the morphemes. Obligatory morphemes appear in boldface, and optional morphemes are in standard font. Note that some of the “optional” morphemes are obligatory with certain verb roots. The obligatory morphemes, however, must appear on each and every single verb.

| '''aspect suffix'''
| expanded aspect suffix
|}

Each of the following sections outlines the shapes that these morphemes can take.

====Pre-pronominal prefixes====
=====Modal pre-pronominal prefixes=====

The prepronominal prefixes express a variety of concepts and ideas. The first concept is [[Linguistic modality|modality]], which expresses the degree of urgency, certainty or likelihood of the event. There are three modal prefixes in Onondaga. The modal prefixes only appear with the punctual aspect. They also appear if there is a modalizer suffix. The first of these is commonly called the future modal prefix (FUT). This prefix expresses events that have not yet taken place at the time the speaker is talking. The second is the factual modal prefix (FACT). This prefix indicates that the speaker knows the event happened for a fact. It typically has a past tense reading (since we are normally only sure about events that happened in the past). The third is [[optative]] modal prefix (OPT). This prefix expresses the idea that the event should or ought to take place. It is also used to express untrue events or events that might have taken place but have not. Here are some examples.

 	(36)	a. 	ęhayę́:twaʔ
 			ę-	ha-		yętw-	aʔ
 			FUT-	3.SG.M.AG-	plant-	PUNC
 			‘He will plant it.’

 		b. 	waʔhayę́:twaʔ
 			waʔ-	ha-		yę:tw-	aʔ
 			FACT-	3.SG.M.AG-	plant-	PUNC
 			‘He planted it.’

 		c. 	ahayę́:twaʔ
 			a-	ha-		yę:tw-	aʔ
 			OPT-	3.SG.M.AG-	plant-	PUNC
 			‘He might plant it.’

The following chart lists forms of the three modal prepronominal prefixes and indicates when to use which form.

=====Non-modal pre-pronominal prefixes=====

	In addition to the modal prefixes, there is also a set of prefixes that express a variety of concepts, some of which do not have a clearly distinct meaning, rather their meaning varies depending on context. The list of these includes repetitive, cislocative, dualic, translocative, partitive, coincident, contrastive, and negative.

======Repetitive======

	The repetitive morpheme adds the meaning of doing something again or repeating some-thing. The basic form of the repetitive morpheme is /s-/. Here are some examples. Example (37) has the prepronominal prefix /sa-/, which is a combination of both repetitive and factual mood. Example (38) has the prepronominal prefix /ęs-/, which is a combination of repetitive and future. These contrast with example (39), which does not have the repetitive morpheme.

 	(37)	sahayę́:twaʔ
 		sa–	ha–	yętw–	aʔ
 		REP.FACT-	3.SG.M-	plant-PUNC
 		‘He planted it again.’		

 	(38)	ęshayę́:twaʔ
 		ęs–	ha–	yętw–	aʔ
 		REP.FUT-	3.SG.M-	plant-PUNC			
 		‘He will plant it again.’				

 	(39)	waʔhayę́:twaʔ
 		waʔ–	ha–	yętw–	aʔ
 		FACT-	3.SG.M-	plant-PUNC		
 		‘He planted it.’

======Cislocative======

The cislocative (CLOC) morpheme is used to indicate movement toward the speaker. It can also mean that a particular event is pinpointed back in time. In some cases, the meaning of the cislocative is unpredictable. Some of these are listed below. There are two forms of the cislocative. 

/t-/	default&lt;br&gt;
/di-/	used with any 2nd person or 1st person inclusive, except 2.SG.AG

======Translocative======

The translocative (TLOC) morpheme is used to indicate movement away from the speaker. The form of the translocative is /he-/

======Dualic======

The dualic (DUC) does not have a specific meaning. The form of the dualic is /de-/, but changes when it appears in combination with other prepronominal prefixes. Whenever it appears with a verb stem, it changes the meaning in unpredictable ways. Usually, however, there is some notion of there being two of something or of some reciprocal activity such as trading. Also, some verb roots must appear with the dualic prepronominal prefix. In examples (41) and (42), the dualic prefix is obligatory. In example (43), the dualic prefix adds the meaning of becoming two pieces.

 	(41)	deyǫshę́thwas 
 		de-	yǫ-	ashęthw-as	
 		DUC-	3.SG.F-	cry-HAB				
 		‘She is crying' 			

 	(42)	dehahahíyaʔks 
 		de-	ha-	ahah-	iyaʔk-	s	
 		DUC-	3.SG.M-	road-	cross-	HAB	
 		‘He crosses a road.’	

 	(43)	dehá:yaʔks 
 		de-	ha-	yaʔk-	s	
 		DUC-	3.SG.M-	break-	HAB	
 		‘He breaks it into two.’

 	(44)	há:yaʔks 
 		ha-	yaʔk-	s	
 		3.SG.M-	break-	HAB	
 		‘He breaks it off.’

====Pronominal prefixes====

There are three series of pronominal prefixes in Onondaga. There is a transitive series, used with transitive verbs. Intransitive verbs use either the agent series or the patient series. The choice between the latter two is often complex, as we will see. The phonological shape of the pronominal prefix depends on the identity of the following sound. This gives rise to several series of pronominal prefixes, which are labelled according to the following segment. These include the c-series (for pronominal prefixes which precede a consonant), the a-series (for pronominal prefixes which precede /a/), the e-series, ę-series, o-series, ǫ-series, and i-series. Finally, the pronominal prefixes inflect for person, number and gender. We discuss each of these in turn.

Onondaga distinguishes three [[Grammatical person|persons]]: first (I or we), second (you) and third (he, she, it or they). The first person can be either [[clusivity|exclusive]] (EXCL), which excludes the listener, or inclusive (INCL), which includes the listener.

Here, when John says we, it does not include the person he’s talking to. In other words, Mary doesn’t get to go to the movies. This use of we is called the first person exclusive. English does not make a distinction between inclusive and exclusive we but Onondaga does. Consider the following two words. The pronominal prefix /dn-/ indicates a first person dual inclusive subject, and the pronominal prefix /agn-/ indicates a first person dual exclusive subject.

 	(45)	weʔdnek
 		weʔ–	dn–		ek–	Ø						
 		FACT-	1.DU.INCL-	eat-	PUNC						
 		‘We two (you and I) ate it.’	

 	(46)	waʔagnek
 		waʔ–	agn–		ek–	Ø	
 		FACT-	1.DU.EXCL-	eat-	PUNC		
 		‘We two (someone else and I) ate it.’

Three numbers are also distinguished in Onondaga: singular (for one entity, SG), dual (for two entities, DU), and plural (for three or more entities, PL). In the glosses, ‘singular’ is marked with SG, ‘dual’ is marked with DU, and ‘plural’ is marked with PL.

 	(47)	waʔsek
 		waʔ–	s–	ek–	Ø	
 		FACT-	2.SG-	eat-	PUNC		
 		‘You (sing.) ate it.’	

 	(48)	weʔsnek
 		weʔ–	sn–	ek–	Ø		
 		FACT-	2.DU-	eat-	PUNC		
 		‘You two ate it.’					

 	(49)	weʔswek
 		weʔ–	sw–	ek–	Ø	
 		FACT-	2.PL-	eat-	PUNC	
 		‘You all ate it.’

Additionally, Onondaga distinguishes three genders, which are realized in the third person only. The first is masculine (M), which is used to refer to male humans and certain animals, either alone or in a group. The second is feminine (F). This is used to refer to female humans, certain animals, or some unknown person. It is sometimes called the feminine-indefinite. For groups of people that contain both men and women, the masculine is used. The third is neuter (N), which is used to refer to most animals and inanimate objects. In older texts, the neuter is used to refer to human females in certain circumstances, although this usage is no longer common. See Abrams (2006: 17) for more discussion. (Abbott, 1984 also discusses two feminine genders in Oneida.) Here are some examples.

 	(50)	a. 	waʔek
 			waʔ-	e-	k-	Ø
 			FACT-	3.SG.F-	eat-	PUNC
 			‘She ate it.’ OR ‘Someone ate it.’

 		b.	waʔwek
 			waʔ-	we-	k-	Ø 
 			FACT-	3.SG.N-	eat-	PUNC
 			‘Something/it ate it.’

 		c. 	waʔhek
 			waʔ-	he-	k-	Ø
 			FACT-	3.SG.M-	eat-	PUNC
 			‘Something/it ate it.’

Finally, we observe that there are two series of prefixes for intransitive verbs, the agent series (AG) and the patient series (PAT). As a general rule, verbs which involve active, purposeful movement or activity on the part of the subject are conjugated with the agent series. Verbs which involve involuntary action or states are conjugated with the patient series. There are so many exceptions to this generalization, however, that one has to simply learn for each intransitive verb whether it takes the agent or the patient series. There is an additional rule for the intransitive verbs that take the agent series. When these verbs appear with stative aspect, they use the patient series rather than the agent series. This rule does not have any exceptions.

There are six classes of conjugations which depend on the initial sound of the following morpheme (i.e., the first sound of the verb root or of the incorporated noun if there is one).

====Reflexive and semireflexive====

This section discusses [[reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] sentences such as “John saw himself,” and “We like ourselves,” and reciprocal sentences such as “We like each other.” The basic form of the reflexive marker (REFL) is /atat-/ and it appears right after the pronominal prefix and before the incorporated noun, if any. The reflexive is typically found only on transitive verbs, but because there is only one participant in the event, we use the intransitive series of pronominal prefixes. Here’s an example of a reflexive and a regular (non-reflexive) transitive for comparison.

 	(56)	a.	waʔgadadaehsę́thwaʔ
 			waʔ-	k-		atat-	aehsęthw-	aʔ
 			FACT-	1.SG.AG-	REFL-	kick-		PUNC
 			‘I kicked myself.’

 		b.	waʔsgaehsę́thwaʔ
 			waʔ-	sk-			aehsęthw-	aʔ
 			FACT-	2.SG.AG:1.SG.PAT-	kick-		PUNC
 			‘You kicked me.’

In the non-reflexive transitive form there is a pronominal prefix, /sk-/ that indicates the subject (‘you’) and the object (‘me’). In the reflexive form, there is only one participant in the act of kicking (‘me’), so the intransitive form of the pronominal prefix is used, /k-/.

A reflexive action is something that you do to yourself. A reciprocal action is something people do to each other. Reciprocals must have at least two people involved. They are formed with the reflexive marker and the dualic prepronominal prefix discussed in section 3.4.1.1.2.4. Here is an example.

 	(57)		waʔthyadadyǫ́dyahdęʔ
 		 	waʔ-	t-	hy-		atat-	yǫtya-	ht-	ęʔ
 		 	FACT-	DUC-	3.DU.AG-	REFL-	laugh-	CAUS-	PUNC
 	 		‘They two made each other laugh.’

The [[semireflexive]] (SRFL) appears in a variety of circumstances that are not easy to pin down. The usual form of the semireflexive is /at-/, but certain verb roots take different forms. Listed here are some of the more common situations in which the semireflexive is used. 

	First, when a person’s own body part is the object of the action a semireflexive is normally used. Here is an example with and without a semireflexive. Again notice that the form with the semireflexive uses the intransitive pronominal prefix while the form without the semireflexive uses the transitive pronominal prefix.

 	(58)	a. 	waʔgadnęntshagetsgwaʔ
 	 		waʔ-	k-		at-	nęntsh-	a-	getsgw-	aʔ
 		 	FACT-	1.SG.AG-	SRFL-	arm-	JOIN-	raise-		PUNC
 		 	‘I raised my arm.’

 		b. 	waʔkhenęntshagetsgwaʔ
 			waʔ-	khe-			nęntsh-	a-	getsgw-	aʔ
 			FACT-	1.SG.AG:3.SG.F.PAT-	arm-	JOIN-	raise-		PUNC
 			‘I raised her arm.’

	Second, the semireflexive is used with verbs of grooming.

 	(59)		John	waʔhadyaʔdohaeʔ 			
 	 		John	waʔ-	ha-		at-	yaʔt-	ohae-	ʔ
 			John	FACT-	3.SG.M.AG-	SRFL-	body-	wash-	PUNC
 			‘John washed (himself).’	

Finally, the semireflexive is used to describe events or actions that are internally caused or spontaneous.

 	(60)	a.	waʔwadehnhóhwak				
  			waʔ-	w-		at-	ehnhohw-	aR-	k
  			FACT-	3.SG.NT.PAT-	SRFL-	door-		apply-	PUNC
  			‘The door closed.’	

  		b.	odųhwejiyáʔgi:h					
  			o-		at-	ųhwęjy-	yaʔk-	ih
  			3.SG.NT.PAT-	SRFL-	earth-		break-	STAT
 			‘The earth has caved in.’ 

:waʔdyųdetgwęʔdaʔné·ga·ʔ
:waʔ-d-yų-adet-gwęʔd-ʔnega·-aʔ
:factual.mode-change.of.state-she-self-belly-burst-at.one.point.in.time
:"she blabbed, she revealed a secret" [literally, 'she burst her belly']

The constituent morphemes are separated by hyphens in the second line of the example. Each one is translated, as closely as possible, in the third line. It is important to understand that none of the component morphemes is a separate word, since they cannot be uttered, or understood, in isolation.

A second way in which linguists classify the morphology of languages is in terms of how the morphemes of a word combine. This distinction is between languages that are [[fusional language|fusional]] and languages that are [[agglutinative]]. Fusion occurs in two ways: a single morpheme may have two or more functions (or meanings) in a given word or contiguous morphemes may affect each other's shape in such a way that it is difficult to segment the word into morphemes. A language is agglutinative if the morphemes composing a word each carries its own meaning and can be easily segmented from its neighbor. Onondaga is fusional (in the second sense of that term). Fusion is especially prevalent at the boundary between prefixes and the stem. Here certain phonological processes take place which change the shapes of one or both contiguous morphemes. For example:

:gędé·ih
:ga-idę·-ih
:neuter.agent.prefix-help.out-stative.aspect
:"it is helping."

Languages are also classified in terms of the preeminent morphological processes they manifest. In Onondaga the two major morphological processes are prefixing and suffixing. Prefixes and suffixes are bound morphemes, that is, they are morphemes that cannot occur in isolation. Onondaga verbs must, minimally, begin in a pronominal prefix and inflect for [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]. For example: 

:hayę́thwas
:ha-yę́thw-as
:third.person.singular.masculine.agent-plant-habitual.aspect
:"he plants"

Nouns must, minimally, begin in a nominal prefix and end in a noun suffix. For example:
:ganáʔjyaʔ
:ga-naʔjy-aʔ
:neuter.agent-pail-noun.suffix
:"pail"

===Nominal Morphology===

A basic noun is composed of the following three morphemes in this order: noun prefix, root, and noun suffix.

According to Woodbury (2003), nouns in Onondaga are categorized into two main classes. These are non-human and human. The inanimate nouns are further divided into natural and man-made. The prefix (NPRE) on the noun depends on these classes. For inanimate nouns, the prefix is either /o-/ for natural objects or /ka-/ for man-made objects. The noun forming suffix also depends on the noun class. It is / aˀ/ for non-human nouns and /-h/ for human nouns.

==Noun incorporation==

Noun [[incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]] is a process of compounding in which two stems, a noun and a verb stem, are combined into a new stem that is inflected with verbal morphology and that functions as a verb. Nouns occupying the semantic roles or [[thematic relations]], of patient, theme, factitive theme, location, goal, path, or instrument are eligible for incorporation. Of these, it is nouns designating semantic patients and themes that are most frequently incorporated. Semantic agents, causers, and beneficiaries are not eligible for incorporation. 

The first example shows that the nominal root -nęh- "corn" has been incorporated into the verbal complex forming a single word. The second example shows the noun /onęhaʔ/ ('corn') as a separate word and preceded by the particle neʔ, a particle which marks a following word or phrase as a nominal.

:waʔhanęhayę́thwaʔ
:waʔ-ha-nęh-yęthw-aʔ
:factual.mode-he-corn-plant-punctual.aspect
:'he planted corn' [literally, 'he corn-planted'].

:waʔhayę́thwaʔ neʔ onę́haʔ
:waʔ-ha-yęthw-aʔ neʔ o-nęh-aʔ
:factual.mode-he-plant-punctual.aspect nominal.particle it-corn-noun.suffix
:'he planted (the) corn'

Noun incorporation is a highly productive process in Onondaga. However, its productivity is an attribute of individual nouns and verbs. Every noun and every verb is lexically marked in terms of its incorporation characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Some nouns incorporate frequently, that is, they can combine with many different verbs,  others almost never. Among the verbs that can incorporate—and some do not incorporate at all—there is a continuum of productivity. At their most productive, verbs can incorporate one of any number of nouns, in fact, some verbs can only occur together with an incorporated noun. Verbs at their most unproductive can incorporate only a single noun. Between these extremes are additional types: verbs that can incorporate only a restricted set of nouns; verb and noun combinations that are highly idiomatic—these often denote conventionalized activities (e.g., English 'he information-gathered)—so that separating the noun, though interpretable, is perceived as inappropriate. 

The use of noun incorporation is governed by various discourse factors. It is often used as a way of backgrounding information.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Word order==

[[Word order]] is typically free in Onondaga (though see question formation below). It depends on various discourse factors.

==Question formation==

[[Wh-questions]] begin with the interrogative word: 

:gaę nų́ tganųhsá·yęʔ
:gaę nų́ t-ga-nųhs-yę-ʔ
:where place here-it-house-be.lying-stative.aspect
:"Where is the house?"

:wadę́ʔ nihsa·dyé·haʔ
:wadę́ʔ ni-hs-adyé·-haʔ
:what thus-you-do-habitual.aspect
:"What are you doing?"

Yes-no questions are formed by appending the question-particle to the questioned item:

:Sędáʔwih khę́h.
:sa-idáʔw-ih khę́h.
:you-be.asleep-stative.aspect question.particle
:"Are you asleep?"

'''Out-of-Home Entertainment''' (also '''OOHE''' or '''OHE''') is a term coined by the amusement industry to collectively refer to experiences at regional attractions like theme parks and waterparks with their thrill rides and slides, and smaller community-based entertainment venues such as family entertainment and cultural venues.

In the US alone, there are nearly 30,000 attractions&amp;mdash;theme and amusement parks, attractions, water parks, family entertainment centers, zoos, aquariums, science centers, museums, and resorts, producing a total nationwide economic impact of $219 billion in 2011, according to leading international industry association, [[International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions]] (IAAPA). The industry directly employs more than 1.3 million and indirectly generates 1 million jobs in the US, creating a total job impact of 2.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iaapa.org/resources/by-park-type/amusement-parks-and-attractions/industry-statistics|title=Amusement Park and Attractions Industry Statistics|website=www.iaapa.org|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the use of this term has gained acceptance with and been popularized by amusement industry players, industry associations, trade magazines and even securities analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seekingalpha.com/article/4062446-investors-play-dave-and-busters|title=Investors Should Play At Dave &amp; Buster's|last=Berner|first=Mike|date=2017-04-14|work=Seeking Alpha|access-date=2018-01-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This stems from the desire to distinguish between the social, competitive atmosphere and dedicated hardware found in location-based entertainment venues from at-home consumer-game entertainment, [[mobile entertainment]] or even [[Augmented reality|augmented reality (AR)]] and [[Virtual reality|virtual reality (VR)]].  The reality is that the lines are increasingly blurred with today's sophisticated consumers and emerging technologies.

This term is not to be confused with [[Out-of-home advertising|out-of-home media advertising]] as used by the advertising industry, although the convergence of digital out-of-home advertising and the digital out-of-home entertainment is producing innovations in retail and hospitality, steeped in fundamentals of social gaming experiences defined by the video amusement industry during the 70’s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/damian-bazadona/a-new-way-to-view-social-_b_14691878.html|title=A New Way To View Social Gaming|last=Bazadona|first=Damian|date=2017-02-13|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
{{See also|History of video games}}
Digital out-of-home entertainment (also '''DOE''') is a sector that is understood by few but is a fast-growing technology sector with plenty of innovations transforming the sector.  Its roots lie in the popularity of [[coin-op]]erated [[arcade video game]]s such as racing, fighting, Japanese imports, or pinball that [[Generation X]] will vividly recall with fond memories of countless hours of their youth spent in dimly-lit video-game rooms (popularly known as 'arcades').

When [[Generation Y]] came along, an audience well-versed in digital gaming favored game consoles over arcade machines.  So while video amusement remains an integral part of the [[popular culture]] fabric today, its relevancy is diminished and even perceived as 'dead' partly due to the lack of coverage by consumer-game media even as the amusement industry transformed itself and research and development investments continue to pour into the sector, evolving and growing the out-of-home, pay-to-play experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=1h6rBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=out+of+home+entertainment+dave+and+busters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RcQoiWIrrM&amp;sig=MLxxfXmIfOk5I26_Xv8xrGA9rck&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihyIaCh_DYAhXBs48KHejvC-EQ6AEIXDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=out%20of%20home%20entertainment%20dave%20and%20busters&amp;f=false|title=The Out-of-Home Immersive Entertainment Frontier: Expanding Interactive Boundaries in Leisure Facilities|last=Williams|first=Kevin|last2=Mascioni|first2=Michael|date=2014-06-27|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781472426956|edition= 1st|location=|pages=5|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the non-profit Digital Out-of-Home Interactive Entertainment Network Association&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dna-association.com/|title=DNA Association Website — Digital Out-of-home Interactive Entertainment Network Association|website=www.dna-association.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established to help "define these amorphous groups that comprise this vibrant industry and illustrate how they all interact" with groups spanning from "[[family entertainment center]]s (FEC), location-based entertainment sites, visitor attractions, theme parks as well as retail, shopping malls and the hospitality sector – and not forgetting museums, heritage sites, schools".

== Forms of Out-of-Home Entertainment ==
Moviegoing is one of the most popular and affordable forms of out-of-home entertainment.
Other classic and expanded forms of OOHE making up the DOE sector include:{{div col|colwidth=30em}}

== Key Actors in Out-of-Home Entertainment ==
=== Family Entertainment Centers ===
{{See also|family entertainment center}}The traditional [[Family entertainment center|FECs]] is a classic form of OOHE that is easily understood by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehutchinson.com/leisure/familyctr.shtml|title=Family Entertainment Centers|website=www.whitehutchinson.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FECs are essentially a converged outgrowth of [[theme restaurant]]s and the winning formula of combining food and entertainment as a business model has been around for more than 30 years.  The first [[Dave &amp; Buster's]] was opened in 1982 in [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas]], [[Texas]] after discovering this winning formula and is a highly-successful FEC chain today with their "Eat, Drink, Play, Watch" offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehutchinson.com/leisure/articles/thatseatertainment.shtml|title=That's Eatertainment! Everything you need to know about combining entertainment and food service to build profit and repeat business|website=www.whitehutchinson.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chuck E. Cheese's|Chuck E. Cheese]] first opened a store in 1977 and became the public embodiment of the typical children's party room combined with a pizza restaurant and arcade.  Other restaurants started to come round to seeing the importance of amusement games and "anchor" attractions ([[bowling alley]]s, [[miniature golf]], [[laser tag]]s, [[batting cage]]s, [[Roller rink|roller skating rinks]], etc.) to encourage dwell time of 1–2 hours and stimulating repeat visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=1h6rBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=out+of+home+entertainment+dave+and+busters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RcQoiWIrrM&amp;sig=MLxxfXmIfOk5I26_Xv8xrGA9rck&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihyIaCh_DYAhXBs48KHejvC-EQ6AEIXDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=out%20of%20home%20entertainment%20dave%20and%20busters&amp;f=false|title=The Out-of-Home Immersive Entertainment Frontier: Expanding Interactive Boundaries in Leisure Facilities|last=Williams|first=Mr Kevin|last2=Mascioni|first2=Mr Michael|date=2014-06-28|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=|isbn=9781472426956|location=|pages=66|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arcade Video Game Developers ===
{{See also|Arcade game|Timeline of arcade video game history}}Probably known more by the [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] arcade video game titles they produced rather than by company names, these video game developers played a defining role in the birth of the video amusement industry. In 1972, [[Atari, Inc. (Atari, SA subsidiary)|Atari]] essentially created the first commercially successful video game ''[[Pong]],'' marking the beginning of the coin-operated [[video game industry]].  In 1978, the first blockbuster arcade video game, ''[[Space Invaders]]'' was produced by [[Taito|Taito Corporation]] and ushered in the [[golden age of arcade video games]]. [[Namco]] (of [[Pac-Man|''Pac-Man''']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s fame), [[Nintendo]] ([[Donkey Kong (video game)|''Donkey Kong'']]), [[Konami]] ([[Frogger's Adventures: The Rescue|''Frogger'']]), [[Capcom]] ([[Street Fighter|''Street Fighters'']]), [[Sega AM2]] (''[[Daytona USA (video game)|Daytona]]'') are among some of the most notable video game developers that remain active today in the video amusement scene.

[[Video game publisher]]s are also making inroads into the OOHE market by licensing iconic IPs ([[intellectual property]]) to experienced arcade game developers and manufacturers, such as the recent collaboration between [[Ubisoft]] and LAI Games to produce ''Virtual Rabbids: The Big Ride'', an attendant-free VR attraction based on the popular ''[[Rabbids]]'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.replaymag.com/lai-december-2017/|title=LAI Virtual Rabbids – December 2017 {{!}} RePlay Magazine|website=www.replaymag.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vrfocus.com/2017/11/ubisofts-rabbids-are-back-in-vr-with-virtual-rabbids-the-big-ride/|title=Ubisoft’s Rabbids Are Back In VR With Virtual Rabbids – The Big Ride|work=VRFocus|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blooloop.com/features/ubisoft-vr-rabbids-maze-lbe/|title=Ubisoft - Rabbids and Assassins Creed VR target new LBE audiences {{!}} blooloop|work=Blooloop|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Redemption Game Manufacturers ===
{{See also|Redemption game}}A redemption game is an arcade amusement game involving skill that rewards the player (in gifts, tokens, etc.) proportionately to his or her score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/redemption-game|title=Redemption-game dictionary definition {{!}} redemption-game defined|website=www.yourdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Merchandiser|Merchandizers]] also fall in the redemption game category.)  One of the most popular redemption games, [[Skee-Ball|''Skee Ball'']], has more than 100,000 Skee-Ball branded alley games in use worldwide by some estimates and continue to endure after more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/why-skee-ball-doesnt-change/509117/|title=Why Skee-Ball Doesn't Change|last=Klin|first=Richard|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, BayTek Games (known for their hit game ''Big Bass Wheel'') bought the rights to ''Skee-Ball'' from Skee-Ball Amusement Games, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vendingtimes.com/articles/bay-tek-acquires-skeeball-the-worlds-oldest-and-re-1344?iid=24D69C2C3ECE4F6C8AA75ED13523F6EE|title=Bay Tek Acquires Skee-Ball, The World's Oldest And Renowned Arcade Alley Game Brand  {{!}} Articles {{!}} Vending Times|website=www.vendingtimes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Innovative Concepts in Entertainment (ICE), another reputable manufacturer, produced hit [[midway (fair)|midway]]-style redemption games such as ''Down The Clown'' and ''Gold Fishin''.  LAI Games (formerly part of the Leisure and Allied Industries Group which founded [[Timezone (video arcades)|Timezone]]) produced hit games such as [[Stacker (game)|''Stacker'']] and ''Speed of Light,'' the latter in which was embedded in popular culture with its appearance in [[Nickelodeon]] TV show [[Game Shakers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.intergameonline.com/coin-op/news/lai-games-debuts-on-nickelodeon|title=LAI Games debuts on Nickelodeon|last=|first=|date=2015-11-10|work=InterGame: iGaming, Casino &amp; Coin-Op News|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable players include Apple Industries, Inc., Coastal Amusements, Universal Space (UNIS), Adrenaline Amusements.

=== Simulator Video Game Manufacturers ===
{{See also|Simulation video game}}Another category of video amusement games are simulators. [[Raw Thrills]], best known for developing arcade video games based on films such as ''[[Jurassic Park Arcade]]'' and ''[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s [[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The]]'' [[The Walking Dead (TV series)|''Walking Dead'']] ''Arcade'', is a common name found in medium and larger-sized FECs.  Other established companies in this category are Triotech, maker of [[Typhoon (simulator)|''Typhoon'']] - a 3D arcade machine with 2 seats and delivers up to 2G Forces of acceleration, and [[CJ Group|CJ 4DPLEX]] with their ''Mini Rider 3D'' - a 2-seat simulator on an electric motion base with a choice of several 3D movies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3448">A '''prismatic compass''' is a [[navigation]] and [[surveying]] instrument which is extensively used to find out the [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] of the traversing and included angles between them, waypoints (an endpoint of the lcourse) and direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-a-prismatic-compass.htm |title=What is a prismatic Compass? |work=wiseGEEK.com | accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Compass]] surveying is a type of surveying in which the directions of surveying lines are determined with a magnetic compass, and the length of the surveying lines are measured with a tape or chain or [[laser]] [[range finder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://civilguides.com/surveyor-and-prismatic-compass/|title=What is Prismatic compass survey?|last=|first=|date=|work=CivilGuides|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compass is generally used to run a traverse line. The compass calculates bearings of lines with respect to [[magnetic north]]. The included angles can then be calculated using suitable formulas in case of clockwise and anti-clockwise traverse respectively. For each survey line in the traverse, surveyors take two bearings that is fore bearing and back bearing which should exactly differ by 180&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; if [[local attraction]] is negligible. The name ''Prismatic compass'' is given to it because it essentially consists of a prism which is used for taking observations more accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EM-sLyVmMwIC | title=Surveying Vol. 1 | accessdate=14 December 2014 | author=Dr. B.C Punmai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Least count==
Least count means the minimum value that an instrument can read which is 15 minutes in case of prismatic compass. It means compass can read only those observations which are multiples of 30 minutes, 5&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; 25&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;, 15&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; 55&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;, 35&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; 45&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt; 30&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DKQuL-uwypsC&amp;pg=PA457 | title=Surveying | accessdate=14 December 2014 | author=Cl Kochher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bearings==
The compass calculates the bearings in whole circle bearing system which determines the angle which the survey line makes with the magnetic north in the clockwise direction. The included angles can be calculated by the formulas '''F-P ±180''' in case of anti-clocwise traverse and '''P-F ±180''' in case of clockwise traverse, where 'F' is the fore bearing of forward line in the direction of survey work and 'P' is the fore bearing of previous line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DKQuL-uwypsC&amp;pg=PA457 | title=Surveying | accessdate=14 December 2014 | author=Cl Kochher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roy Andrew Miller''' (September 5, 1924 &amp;ndash; August 22, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;[http://obits.staradvertiser.com/2014/09/20/roy-andrew-miller/ Obituary] (''[[Honolulu Star-Advertiser]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity-memorial/obituary.aspx?n=Roy-Miller&amp;lc=4873&amp;pid=172513260&amp;mid=6098742 Obituary] (Borthwick Mortuary).&lt;/ref&gt; was an American linguist notable for his advocacy of Korean and Japanese as members of the [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] group of languages.

== Biography ==
Miller was born in [[Winona, Minnesota|Winona]], [[Minnesota]], on September 5, 1924, to Andrew and Jessie (née Eickelberry) Miller. In 1953, he completed a Ph.D. in Chinese and Japanese at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]]. Long a student of languages, his early work in the 1950s was largely with Chinese and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]. For example, in 1969 he wrote the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] entry on the [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] of [[South Asia]].

He was Professor of Linguistics at the [[International Christian University]] in [[Tokyo]] from 1955 to 1963. Subsequently he taught at [[Yale University]]; between 1964 and 1970, he was chairman of the department of East and South Asian Languages and Literatures. From 1970 until 1989 he held a similar post at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]]. He then taught in Europe, mainly in Germany and [[Scandinavia]].

He wrote extensively on the Japanese language, from ''A Japanese Reader'' (1963) and ''The Japanese Language'' (1967) to ''Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages'' (1971) and ''Nihongo: In Defense of Japanese'' (1986). He later broadened his scope by linking Korean both to Japanese and Altaic, most notably in ''Languages and History: Japanese, Korean, and Altaic'' (1996).

On the occasion of his 75th birthday, Professors [[Karl Menges]] and [[Nelly Naumann]] prepared a [[Festschrift]] highlighting his career and including articles on Altaic languages.&lt;ref&gt;Menges, Karl H., and Nelly Naumann (eds.) (1999). ''Language and Literature &amp;ndash; Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages: Studies in Honour of Roy Andrew Miller on His 75th Birthday''. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sebastian Patrick Quintus Rahtz''' (13 February 1955 – 15 March 2016) was a British digital humanities information professional. Born in 1955 to [[Somerset]]-focused archaeologist  [[Philip Rahtz]], Sebastian trained in archaeology, before delving into the computing realm via ''Lexicon of Greek Personal Names'' in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/ |title=Homepage, Lexicon of Greek Personal Names, University of Oxford |publisher=Lgpn.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a long-term contributor to multiple communities in the broader digital humanities, including LGPN,  [[TeX]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tug.org/interviews/rahtz.html |title=Sebastian Rahtz - Interview - TeX Users Group |publisher=Tug.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact Author |url=https://www.ctan.org/author/rahtz?lang=en |title=Contributor Sebastian Rahtz |publisher=CTAN |date= |accessdate=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; computer methods in archaeology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caa-international.org/2016/03/16/sebastian-rahtz/ |title=Sebastian Rahtz |publisher=CAA International |date=2016-02-16 |accessdate=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Text Encoding Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/FM1.html |title=iii.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6358">The '''Serapeum of Saqqara''' is a [[serapeum]] located north west of the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] at [[Saqqara]], a [[necropolis]] near [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in [[Lower Egypt]]. It was a burial place of [[Apis (deity)|Apis bulls]], [[sacred bull]]s that were incarnations of the [[ancient Egyptian deities|ancient Egyptian deity]] [[Ptah]]. It was believed that the bulls became immortal after death as ''[[Osiris]] Apis'', a name that appears in [[Coptic language|Coptic]] as {{Lang|cop|ⲟⲩⲥⲉⲣϩⲁⲡⲓ}}, ''Userhapi'', which was borrowed in [[Greek language|Greek]] as {{lang|grc|Σέραπις}}, ''Serapis'', in the [[Hellenistic period]].

==History==
The most ancient burials found at this site date back to the reign of [[Amenhotep III]], the ninth pharaoh of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] during the 1350s BC.

Working as an administrator during the reign of his father, [[Khaemweset]], a son of [[Ramesses II]] (1279–1213 BC) of the nineteenth dynasty, ordered that a tunnel, now known as "The Lesser Vaults", be excavated through one of the mountains at the site and designed with side chambers to contain large granite [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] weighing up to 70 tonnes each, to hold the mummified remains of the bulls.&lt;ref&gt;Mathieson, I., Bettles, E., Clarke, J., Duhig, C., Ikram, S., Maguire, L., et al. (1997). The National Museums of Scotland Saqqara survey project 1993-1995. ''Journal of Egyptian archaeology'', ''83'', 17-53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathieson, I., Bettles, E., Dittmer, J., &amp; Reader, C. (1999). The National Museums of Scotland Saqqara survey project, earth sciences 1990-1998. ''Journal of Egyptian archaeology'', ''85'', 21-43.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A second tunnel, approximately 350 m in length, 5 m tall and 3 m wide ({{convert|350|*|5|*|3|m|ft|disp=output only}}), now known as "The Greater Vaults", was excavated under [[Psamtik I]] (664–610 BC) of the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]] and later used by the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].

The long boulevard leading to the ceremonial site, flanked by 600 [[sphinx]]es, likely was built under [[Nectanebo I]], (379/8–361/0 BC) the founder of the thirtieth dynasty (the last native one).

==Discovery==
The temple was discovered by [[Auguste Mariette]],&lt;ref&gt;Malek, J. (1983). Who Was the First to Identify the Saqqara Serapeum? ''Chronique d'Egypte Bruxelles'', ''58''(115-116), 65-72.&lt;/ref&gt; who had gone to Egypt to collect Coptic-language manuscripts, but later grew interested in the remains of the Saqqara necropolis.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Adès, ''A Traveller's History of Egypt'' (Chastleton Travel/Interlink, 2007) {{ISBN|1-905214-01-4}} p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, Mariette found the head of one sphinx sticking out of the shifting desert [[dune]]s, cleared the sand and followed the boulevard to the site. After using explosives to clear rocks blocking the entrance to the catacomb, he excavated most of the complex.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson, A. (2000). The Eighteenth Century discovery of the Serapeum. ''KMT'', ''11''(3), 48-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, his notes of the excavation were lost, which has complicated the use of these burials in establishing an [[Egyptian chronology]]. 

Mariette found one undisturbed burial, which is now at the Agricultural Museum in [[Cairo]]. The other 24 sarcophagi of the bulls, had been robbed.&lt;ref&gt;Farag, Sami (1975). ''Two Serapeum Stelae'': Egypt Exploration Society. JEA, 61, pp 165-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
A controversial aspect of the Saqqara find is that for the period between the reign of [[Ramesses XI]] and the twenty-third year of the reign of [[Osorkon II]] &amp;ndash; about 250 years &amp;ndash; only nine burials have been discovered, including three sarcophagi Mariette reported to have identified in a chamber too dangerous to excavate (that have not been located since). Because the average lifespan of a bull was between 25 and 28 years, egyptologists believe that more burials should have been found. Furthermore, four of the burials attributed by Mariette to the reign of Ramesses XI have since been retrodated. Scholars who favour changes to the standard [[Egyptian chronology]], such as [[David Rohl]], have argued that the dating of the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] should be pushed some 300 years later on the basis of the Saqqara discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Beechick, R. (2001). Chronology for everybody. ''Technical Journal'', ''15''(3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohl, D. M. ''Pharaohs and kings'': Crown Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohl, D. M. (1992). ''A Test of Time: The New Chronology of Egypt and its Implications for Biblical Archaeology and History''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most scholars rebut that it is far more likely that some burials of sacred bulls are waiting to be discovered and excavated.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, M. (1999). ''THE NEW CHRONOLOGY DEBATE - Problems of Synthesis - A criticism of the New Chronology from Margreet Steiner''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Molnár, J. (2003).

'''Sirpur Group of Monuments''' are an archaeological and tourism site containing Buddhist monuments from the 5th to 12th centuries in [[Mahasamund district]] of the state of [[Chhattisgarh]], [[India]].&lt;ref name=pradhan854&gt;Atula Kumar Pradhan and Shambhoonath Yadav (2013), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/44158887 Sirpur - A unique township of early medieval India], Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, Vol. 74 (2013), pp. 854-864&lt;/ref&gt; Located near an eponymous village, it is {{convert|78|km}} east of [[Raipur]], the capital of the state.&lt;ref name="raipurgov1"&gt;[http://raipur.gov.in/tourism.htm#Bk3 Sirpur] raipur.gov.in&lt;/ref&gt; The site is spread near the banks of the river [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]].&lt;ref name="prasarbharti"&gt;[http://www.newsonair.nic.in/SIRPUR-%20A%20Goldmine%20of%20History.asp SIRPUR : A Goldmine of History ] Prasar Bharti&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of Sirpur (aka Shirpur) has been mentioned in epigraphic and textual records dated to the 5th to the 8th centuries CE. The city was once the capital of the [[Sharabhapuriya dynasty|Sharbhapuriya]] and [[Somavamshi dynasty|Somavamshi]] kings of [[Dakshina Kosala]] state. It was an important Buddhist, Hindu and Jain settlement of the South Kosala kingdom between the 5th and the 12th century CE.&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt; It was visited by Hieun Tsang, the 7th century Chinese Buddhist pilgrim. Recent excavations have uncovered 12 Buddhist [[vihara]]s, 1 Jain vihara, monolithic statues of [[Buddha]] and [[Mahavira]], 22 [[Shiva]] temples and 5 [[Vishnu]] temples, Shakti and Tantric temples, underground granary market and a sixth century bath house.

==History==
[[File:8th century couple at Tivara Deva temple, she steps on his feet seeks forgiveness with namaste gesture, Sirpur monuments Chhattisgarh India.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Sirpur relief excavated: she steps on his feet, seeks forgiveness with a namaste gesture.]]
Sirpur, also referred to as Shripur and Sripura (literally, "city of auspiciousness, abundance, Lakshmi") in ancient Indian texts and inscriptions, is a village on the [[Mahanadi River]] {{convert|78|km}} east of [[Raipur]]. In the second half of the 1st millennium CE, it was the capital city with major commercial and religious significance for the [[Dakshina Kosala]] kingdom.&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt; The earliest documented evidence states that it was first a capital of [[Sharabhapuriya dynasty]], followed by [[Panduvamshis of Dakshina Kosala|Panduvamshi]] dynasty.&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt; The Sharabhapuriya dynasty itself is dated to the late 5th century CE, but inscriptions mention its first capital to be Sharabhapura, as yet an unknown site.&lt;ref name="Williams1981p137"/&gt;

The abundant inscriptions of the mid-6th century CE in the region mention the Hindu Shaiva king Teevardeva and 8th-century king Shivagupta Balarjuna establishing temples and monasteries for Hindus, Buddhists and Jains in his kingdom. The Chinese pilgrim and traveller [[Xuanzang|Huen T'sang]] mentions visiting Sirpur in 639 CE in his memoirs.&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt; He wrote that the king was a [[Kshatriya]] and benevolent to the Buddhists, the region was prosperous. According to his memoir, some 10,000 Mahayana Buddhist ''bhikshus'' (monks) lived here in some 100 monasteries, and there were over 100 temples.&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt;

The earliest dated Sirpur monument is the Lakshmana temple, dated to 595-605 CE. Along with it, numerous other temples along the Mahanadi River stretching over {{convert|150|km}} from Rajim to Kharod have been located and dated to between 600 and 710 CE.&lt;ref name="Williams1981p137"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joanna Gottfried Williams|title=Kalādarśana: American Studies in the Art of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-qoeAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA137 |year=1981|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-06498-2|pages=137–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Kosala kingdom, along with the capital Sirpur, was taken over by the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri dynasty]] in the 11th century, with eastern parts of the South Kosala taken over by the Somavamshi kingdom to their east.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarty2010p107"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dilip K. Chakrabarty|title=The Geopolitical Orbits of Ancient India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIAyDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT107 |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-908832-4|pages=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th century and 13th century history of the region is unclear. Excavations in the region have yielded layers of deposits, traceable from the mid 1st millennium BCE, the Gupta Empire period, through the late medieval period with the youngest layer of deposits being ruins mixed with ''chilum'' (smoke pipe) and Sultanate era coins suggesting that Sirpur was an active human settlement at least through the early Delhi Sultanate.&lt;ref name="Sharma2007p46"&gt;{{cite book|author=G.S. Khwaja|editor=Arun Kumar Sharma|title=Excavations at Sirpur, Chhattisgarh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wM-pCR35QZMC|year=2007|publisher=Indian Archaeological Society|pages=46–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological site===
Sirpur became a major archaeological site after it was visited in 1882 by [[Alexander Cunningham]], a colonial British India official.&lt;ref name="Cunningham1884"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Alexander Cunningham|title=Report of a Tour in the Central Provinces and Lower Gangetic Doab in 1881-1882|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUYpAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA23|year=1884|pages=23–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His report on a Laxman (Lakshmana) temple at Sirpur brought it to international attention. The site remained neglected in early 20th-century during the decades of the World Wars, and excavations resumed in 1953.&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt; There were further excavations in 1990s and then particularly after 2003 when 184 mounds were identified and some selectively excavated. Those excavations have so far yielded 22 Shiva temples, 5 Vishnu temples, 10 Buddha Viharas, 3 Jain Viharas, a 6th/7th century market and snana-kund (bath house).&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt; The site shows extensive syncretism, where Buddhist and Jain statues or motifs intermingle with Shiva, Vishnu and Devi temples.&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt;

There are two theories on the demise of Sirpur city and what led to the capital's sudden ruin. One posits that an earthquake leveled the entire region and people abandoned the capital and the kingdom. Another posits a catastrophic destruction after invasion and plunder. Coins of Sultan Alaud din Khalji of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] have been found among the ruins, and the stairs of one of the monuments show signs of partial caving in, neither establishes nor rules out the proposals. The discovery of Khalji era coins mixed with the ruins during the excavation can be attributed to other reasons such as trade between Delhi Sultanate and Dakshina Kosala kingdom, and a spot caving in can be because of localized soil [[subsidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Om Prakash Misra|title=Archaeological Excavations in Central India: Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0ISjDDWJwQC |year=2003|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-874-7|pages=208–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sirpur is also a major archaeological site for "bronze sculptures from the early medieval period". According to Geri Hockfield Malandra, Sirpur was a significant bronze workshop of ancient India and the Buddhist bronze artwork excavated from Sirpur are among the "finest bronze sculptures" of that era.&lt;ref name="Malandra1993p112"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geri Hockfield Malandra|title=Unfolding A Mandala: The Buddhist Cave Temples at Ellora|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MU44LPu3mbUC&amp;pg=PA112|year=1993|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1355-5|pages=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are striking similarities between the artwork in Sirpur and the [[Ellora Caves]] as well as Ratnagiri, according to Malandra, and this may suggest a flow of ideas and artists between the two regions.&lt;ref name="Malandra1993p112"/&gt;

==Hindu monuments==
[[File:7th century Lakshmana Hindu temple, Sirpur Chhattisgarh India 1.jpg|thumb|left|Laxman temple at Sirpur]]

===Lakshmana temple===
The Lakshmana temple, also spelled Laxman temple, is a 7th-century brick temple, mostly damaged and ruined. The garbhagriya entrance along with the tower and door carvings of the Lakshmana temple at Sirpur are reasonably intact enough to be studied. Above the sanctum door's lintel are carvings show a reclining Vishnu on Sesha (Anantasayana Vishnu) and a panel on Krishna from ''Bhagavata Purana''. Around the door are bands of carvings which show the ten [[avatar]]s of Vishnu along with daily life and couples in various stages of courtship and [[mithuna]]. The temple stands on a stone ''jagati'' platform (about 40'x80') with wide enough space for circumambulation. The temple itself is built of brick except for the carved frame around the grabha-griya (sanctum) made of stone. The sanctum opens to the east. In front of the sanctum is the outline of an antarala (vestibule), and an oblong mandapa (ceremonial community hall). The hall shows stub places for pillars, all now lost to history. Except for the sanctum and the tower, much is in ruins. The sanctum stone frame outside is a 22x22 feet square, inside it is about 10x10 feet square. The sanctum walls are plain like typical Hindu temples. The original statue of sanctum is missing. The site management has installed several small statues for visitors from what was found in the ruins pile.&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt;

===Rama temple===
Rama temple is situated less than 100 meters southeast of the Lakshmana temple, but it is almost entirely in ruins. The Rama temple site, however, does preserve the foundation outline of several shrines as well as brick stub of the lower part of the original Rama temple.&lt;ref name="stadtner139"/&gt; Immediately to the north of the Rama temple is an outline which local tradition states was also dedicated to Lakshmana as Rama-Lakshmana pair. The Rama temple follows a stellate (star-shape) jagati pattern, while its Lakshmana pair was without one. The mandapa and other features of the Rama were destroyed long ago, according to Donald Stadtner, and the Rama temple site is likely to be from about 600 CE. This is one of the earliest star shape ''jagati'' platform temple in central India. It may have served as a prototype practice temple, before Sirpur architects of the 7th century built much grander stellate-principle Hindu temples in Kharod, Palari and Rajim.&lt;ref name="stadtner139"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Stadtner|editor=Joanna Gottfried Williams|title=Kalādarśana: American Studies in the Art of India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-qoeAAAAIAAJ|year =1981|publisher=BRILL Academic| isbn=90-04-06498-2|pages=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gandheshwar temple===
Gandheshwar Temple: an active Shiva temple, Gandheshwar temple is situated on the banks of the [[Mahanadi|Mahanadi River]].&lt;ref name="cgtourism.choice.gov.in"/&gt; From the river, there are stone stairs to walk to the sanctum. The temple is routinely re-washed and re-painted. It likely includes recovered ruins from the area, in which the locals have included Hindu, Buddhist and Jain iconography. A stone slab that is part of the temple wall has a Sanskrit inscription in Nagari script, starting with Om symbol and dedicated to Shiva, which has been dated to the 8th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ajay Mitra Shastri|title=Inscriptions of the Śarabhapurīyas, Pāṇḍuvaṁśins and Somavaṁśins|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7cyQ8BxzR4kC |publisher= Motilal Banarsidass  |isbn= 978-81-208-0637-5|pages= 152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baleshwar Mahadev temples===
Baleshwar Mahadev temples group: A Shiva temple about 50 meter northwest of the Teevar dev monument, across the Sirpur road. It consists of several temples. For three Shiva temples excavated, a circumambulatory [[Jagati (temple)|Jagati]] in the form of a high rise platform, similar to Lakshmana temple survives. For another only the foundation is visible. The cluster was built by the Shaiva king Shivagupta Balarjuna, and is dated to the mid 8th century. Two of the temple are located side by side, and unlike most Sirpur temples, these open to the west. Both have a mandapa, an antarala and have a star shaped garbha griya made out of bricks and stone. The stellate sanctum is formed out of two squares, one rotated by 45 degrees. Some of the artwork discovered during excavations are displayed, and these show women and couple standing dressed up in 8th-century attire. The sanctum has Shiva linga made from marble.

[[File:7th - 9th century Surang tila temple, Sirpur monuments Chhattisgarh.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.85|Surang tila temple, Sirpur.]]

===Surang tila===
Surang tila: It is the largest temple complex in Sirpur, with a pillared terrace raised 30 feet above the group, stone steps connecting the terrace to the ruined mandapa platform remains below. The stairs have partially caved it in a spot from ground [[subsidence]]. The pillared terrace on the top was likely a mandapa, as it has ruins of many carved pillars in navaranga pattern. The terrace connects with five sanctums, which have two gray Shiva linga, one features a black granite Shiva linga and other two are dedicated to Vishnu. The temple is made out of white stone. It used to be a soil mound with tunnels (''surang'') used by the locals, but the temple was excavated between 2006 and 2007. An inscription was found during the excavation which is now in the Raipur museum. According to this inscription, this temple was operating during the time of Shivagupta Balarjuna, and the temple is dated to 7th or 8th century. Below the temple terrace, are ruins of two buildings, one likely a residence for priests and monks, another a small tantric temple with 16-edge Shiva linga possibly from later centuries.&lt;ref name=outlook2014/&gt;

===Other monuments===
Rakela Tal, fort ruins and other temples: located south near the Rama temple on the east side of the Sirpur road is a man made lake full of lotus flowers. Around the lake are ruins of an old fort, several Hindu and Buddhist monuments mixed in with farmlands and a modern era Krishna temple. Sirpur has over 20 other excavated medieval temples and 50 additional unexcavated mounds spread over a three square kilometres area.

==Buddhist monuments==
[[File:8th century Buddha statue at Tivara Deva Vihara, Sirpur monuments Chhattisgarh India.jpg|thumb|left|A Buddha statue excavated from monastery ruins.]]

===Ananda Prabhu vihara===
Ananda Prabhu Kuti vihara: a temple and 14-room monastery, built by Bhikshu Anand Prabhu, called Ananda Prabha in some inscriptions, with sponsorship from the Hindu king Sivagupta Balarjuna. The monastery and temple ruins included a monument to [[Avalokiteśvara]] and Makarwahini Gange. A stone inscription found at the site, in Sanskrit written in Nagari script and dated to mid 8th century CE uses a mix of Vedic meters (Anustubh, Sragdhara, Arya, Vasantatilaka and others). The inscription states starts with auspicious symbol Om and Siddham, praises Sugata (Buddha) then lauds king Balarjuna. It thereafter mentions monk Anandaprabha, devoted to the Buddha the Maravarin (enemy of Mara) and the destroyer of the cycle of rebirth and death. The inscription says the king established a "vihara kuti" (monastery residences) and a free feeding house for all the monks there furnished with ''setike'' and ''vyanjana'' (rice meal with condiments) for  "so long as the sun adorns the sky" (perpetuity). The inscription poem thereafter reminds the monks to remember the spirit of the king's gift, the [[impermanence]] of wealth, that [[dharma]] is the only saving grace to suffering-filled worldly existence. The inscription is signed by the artist who created it for the monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ajay Mitra Shastri|title=Inscriptions of the Śarabhapurīyas, Pāṇḍuvaṁśins and Somavaṁśins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7cyQ8BxzR4kC |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass  |isbn=978-81-208-0637-5|pages=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swastika vihara===
Swastika vihara: excavated in the 1950s, the aerial view of this monument's layout reminds of the swastika sign. This site yielded a Buddha statue and metallic idols relating to the Buddhist era. Along with Buddha was the image of Padamapani carrying a fly whisk.&lt;ref name="cgtourism.choice.gov.in"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cgtourism.choice.gov.in/sites/default/files/temp/31%20Sirpur%20Leaflet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801134451/http://cgtourism.choice.gov.in/sites/default/files/temp/31%20Sirpur%20Leaflet.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teevardev===
Teevar dev: a monastery from the [[Dakshina Kosala]] era, this Vihara, also referred to as Tivradeva, is located near a Shiva temple and is about 1&amp;nbsp;km away from the Lakshmana temple. The temple is syncretic, built by a Shaiva king and his Buddhist queen, it shows Hindu and Buddhist themes. The monument is a syncretic collection of Buddhist and Hindu arts, as it shows along with Buddha statues and Buddhist artwork, Hindu themes such as Ganga and Yamuna goddesses, kama and mithuna scenes, ''Panchatantra'' tales as well as Gajalakshmi.&lt;ref name=outlook2014&gt;[https://www.outlookindia.com/outlooktraveller/destinations/sirpur_the_tantric_trail/ Sirpur: The tantric trail], Bibek Bhattacharya, Outlook traveller (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jain monuments==
One Jain basati and monastery ruins has been discovered near the river banks and about 100 meters from an 8th-century Shiva temple. A bronze image of [[Rishabhanatha|Adinatha]] (Rishbha, the first Tirthankara) was found in the ruins, and the image is dated to the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Om Prakash Misra|title=Archaeological Excavations in Central India: Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0ISjDDWJwQC |year=2003|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-874-7|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ASI Museum==
A museum managed by [[Archaeological Survey of India]] in the Lakshmana temple premises preserves the artwork parts and pieces of archaeological ruins found during excavations in the 1950s and in the 2000s. These belong to [[Shaivism|Shaiva]], [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnav]], Buddha and [[Jainism|Jain]] religions and variously dated to between 6th and 12th centuries.&lt;ref name="cgtourism.choice.gov.in"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_tktd_chts_laxman.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12443">'''TRACE''' is a [[connectionist]] model of [[speech perception]], proposed by [[James McClelland (psychologist)|James McClelland]] and [[Jeffrey Elman]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="trace"&gt;McClelland, J.L., &amp; Elman, J.L. (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on a structure called "the Trace," a dynamic processing structure made up of a network of units, which performs as the system's working memory as well as the perceptual processing mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McClelland|first1=James|last2=Elman|first2=Jeffrey|title=The TRACE Model of Speech Perception|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=January 1986|volume=18|issue=1|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(86)90015-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; TRACE was made into a working computer program for running perceptual simulations.  These simulations are predictions about how a human mind/brain processes speech sounds and words as they are heard in real time.

==Inspiration==
TRACE was created during the formative period of connectionism, and was included as a chapter in ''Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructures of Cognition''.&lt;ref&gt;McClelland, J.L., D.E. Rumelhart and the PDP Research Group (1986). Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition. Volume 2: Psychological and Biological Models, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press
&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found that certain problems regarding speech perception could be conceptualized in terms of a connectionist interactive activation model.  The problems were that (1) speech is extended in time, (2) the sounds of speech (phonemes) overlap with each other, (3) the articulation of a speech sound is affected by the sounds that come before and after it, and (4) there is natural variability in speech (e.g. foreign accent) as well as noise in the environment (e.g. busy restaurant). Each of these causes the speech signal to be complex and often ambiguous, making it difficult for the human mind/brain to decide what words it is really hearing. In very simple terms, an interactive activation model solves this problem by placing different kinds of processing units (phonemes, words) in isolated layers, allowing activated units to pass information between layers, and having units within layers compete with one another, until the “winner” is considered “recognized” by the model.

==Key findings==
"TRACE was the first model that instantiated the activation of multiple word candidates that match any part of the speech input."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weber|first=Andrea|last2=Scharenborg|first2=Odette|date=2012-05-01|title=Models of spoken-word recognition|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.1178/abstract|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=387–401|doi=10.1002/wcs.1178|issn=1939-5086}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simulation of speech perception involves presenting the TRACE computer program with mock speech input, running the program, and generating a result.  A successful simulation indicates that the result is found to be meaningfully similar to how people process speech.

===Time-course of word recognition===
It is generally accepted in [[psycholinguistics]] that (1) when the beginning of a word is heard, a set of words that share the same initial sound become activated in memory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marslen-Wilson | first1 = W. | last2 = Tyler | first2 = L. K. | year = 1980 | title = The temporal structure of spoken language understanding | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 1–71 | doi=10.1016/0010-0277(80)90015-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2) the words that are activated compete with each other while more and more of the word is heard,&lt;ref&gt;
Luce, P. A., &amp; Pisoni, D. B.  (1998).  Recognizing spoken words:  The neighborhood activation model.  Ear and Hearing, 19, 1-36.&lt;/ref&gt; (3) at some point, due to both the auditory input and the lexical competition, one word is recognized.&lt;ref name="trace"/&gt;

For example, a listener hears the beginning of ''bald'', and the words bald, ball, bad, bill become active in memory. Then, soon after, only bald and ball remain in competition (bad, bill have been eliminated because the vowel sound doesn't match the input). Soon after, bald is recognized.  TRACE simulates this process by representing the temporal dimension of speech, allowing  words in the lexicon to vary in activation strength, and by having words compete during processing.  Figure 1 shows a line graph of word activation in a simple TRACE simulation.
[[File:TRACE simulation of the word 'bald'.png|thumb|center|325px|Figure 1 - A simple TRACE simulation. Word activation and competition unfolds in time. In this simulation, the word "bald" becomes the most active, therefore it is considered to be the one that is recognized.]]

===Lexical effect on phoneme perception===
If an ambiguous speech sound is spoken that is exactly in between {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}, the hearer may have difficulty deciding what it is.  But, if that same ambiguous sound is heard at the end of a word like woo/?/ (where ? is the ambiguous sound), then the hearer will more likely perceive the sound as a {{IPA|/d/}}.  This probably occurs because wood is a word but woot is not.  An ambiguous phoneme presented in a lexical context will be perceived as consistent with the surrounding lexical context.  This perceptual effect is known as the Ganong effect.&lt;ref&gt;Ganong, W. F. (1980). Phonetic categorization in auditory perception. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human 
Perception and Performance, 6, 110–125.&lt;/ref&gt; TRACE reliably simulates this, and can explain it in relatively simple terms.  Essentially, the lexical unit which has become activated by the input (i.e. wood) feeds back activation to the phoneme layer, boosting the activation of its constituent phonemes (i.e. {{IPA|/d/}}), thus resolving the ambiguity.

===Lexical basis of segmentation===
Speakers usually don't leave pauses in between words when speaking{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}, yet listeners seem to have no difficulty hearing speech as a sequence of words.  This is known as the [[speech perception#segmentation|segmentation problem]], and is one of the oldest problems in the [[psycholinguistics|psychology of language]]. TRACE proposed the following solution, backed up by simulations.  When words become activated and recognized, this reveals the location of word boundaries.  Stronger word activation leads to greater confidence about word boundaries, which informs the hearer of where to expect the next word to begin.&lt;ref name="trace"/&gt;

==How TRACE works==
The TRACE model is a connectionist network with an input layer and three processing layers: pseudo-spectra (feature), phoneme and word. Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of TRACE. There are three types of connectivity: (1) feedforward excitatory connections from input to features, features to phonemes, and phonemes to words; (2) lateral (i.e., within layer) inhibitory connections at the feature, phoneme and word layers; and (3) top-down feedback excitatory connections from words to phonemes. 
The input to TRACE works as follows.  The user provides a phoneme sequence that is converted into a multi-dimensional feature vector.   This is an approximation of acoustic spectra extended in time.  
The input vector is revealed a little at a time to simulate the temporal nature of speech.  As each new chunk of input is presented, this sends activity along the network connections, changing the activation values in the processing layers. Features activate phoneme units, and phonemes activate word units.  Parameters govern the strength of the excitatory and inhibitory connections, as well as many other processing details.  
There is no specific mechanism that determines when a word or a phoneme has been recognized.  If simulations are being compared to reaction time data from a perceptual experiment (e.g. lexical decision), then typically an activation threshold is used.  This allows for the model behavior to be interpreted as recognition, and a recognition time to be recorded as the number of processing cycles that have elapsed. For deeper understanding of TRACE processing dynamics, readers are referred to the original publication&lt;ref name="trace"/&gt; and to a TRACE  [http://maglab.psy.uconn.edu/jtrace/ software tool] that runs simulations with a graphical user interface.

==Criticism==

===Modularity of mind debate===
TRACE’s relevance to the [[modularity of mind|modularity]] debate has recently been brought to the fore by Norris, Cutler and McQueen’s (2001) report on the [[Merge (psycholinguistics)|Merge (?)]] model of speech perception.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, D., McQueen, J. M., &amp; Cutler, A. (2000). Merging information in speech recognition: Feedback is never necessary. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 23, 299-370.
&lt;/ref&gt; While it shares a number of features with TRACE, a key difference is the following. While TRACE permits word units to feed back activation to the phoneme level, Merge restricts its processing to feed-forward connections. In the terms of this debate, TRACE is considered to violate the principle of information encapsulation, central to modularity, when it permits a later stage of processing (words) to send information to an earlier stage (phonemes).  Merge advocates for modularity by arguing that the same class of perceptual phenomena that is accounted for in TRACE can be explained in a connectionist architecture that ''does not'' include feedback connections.  Norris et al. point out that when two theories can explain the same phenomenon, [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] dictates that the simpler theory is preferable.

==Applications==

===Speech and language therapy===
Models of language processing can be used to conceptualize the nature of impairment in persons with [[speech therapy|speech and language disorder]]. For example, it has been suggested that language deficits in [[expressive aphasia]] may be caused by excessive competition between lexical units, thus preventing any word from becoming sufficiently activated.&lt;ref&gt;Self-organizing dynamics of lexical access in normals and aphasics.  McNellis, Mark G.; Blumstein, Sheila E.; Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, Vol 13(2), Feb 2001. pp. 151-170.&lt;/ref&gt;  Arguments for this hypothesis consider that mental dysfunction can be explained by slight perturbation of the network model's processing. This emerging line of research incorporates a wide range of theories and models, and TRACE represents just one piece of a growing puzzle.

===Distinction from speech recognition software===
Psycholinguistic models of speech perception, e.g. TRACE, must be distinguished from computer [[speech recognition]] tools.  The former are psychological theories about how the human mind/brain processes information. The latter are engineered solutions for converting an acoustic signal into text.  Historically, the two fields have had little contact, but this is beginning to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scharenborg | first1 = O. | last2 = Norris | first2 = D. | last3 = ten Bosch | first3 = L. | last4 = McQueen | first4 = J.M. | year = 2005 | title = How should a speech recognizer work? | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 29 | issue = 6| pages = 867–918 | doi=10.1207/s15516709cog0000_37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
TRACE’s influence in the psychology literature can be assessed by the number of articles that cite it.  There are 345 citations of McClelland and Elman (1986) in the [[PsycINFO]] database.  Figure 3 shows the distribution of those citations over the years since publication.  The figure suggests that interest in TRACE grew significantly in 2001, and has remained strong, with about 30 citations per year.

'''''The Automatic Message''''' (1933) (''Le Message Automatique'') was one of [[André Breton]]'s significant theoretical works about automatism. The essay was first published in the magazine ''[[Minotaure]]'', No. 3-4, (Paris) 1933.

In 1997 it became the title of a compilation of [[surrealism|surrealist]] writing of [[André Breton]], [[Paul Éluard]] and [[Philippe Soupault]], amongst  others. The book includes two vital “automatic” texts of surrealism.

Breton’s prefatory essay ''The Automatic Message'' relates the technique to the underlying concepts and aesthetic of surrealism.

''[[Les Champs Magnétiques|The Magnetic Fields (Les Champs Magnétiques)]]'' (1919) by Breton and Soupault, was the first work of literary surrealism and one of the foundations of modern European thought and writing. ''The Automatic Message'' contains the authorised translation by the poet [[David Gascoyne]], himself a member of the group, and a friend of both authors.

''The Immaculate Conception'' (1930) traces the interior and exterior life of man from ''Conception'' and ''Intra-Uterine Life'' to ''Death and The Original Judgement'', and includes a section with a series of “simulations” of various types of mental instability.

'''''The Blonde, the Brunette and the Vengeful Redhead''''' is a one-woman play by Australian playwright [[Robert Hewett]]. It is presented as a series of eight individual monologues by seven characters who were affected by the actions of Rhonda Russell, the first character in the play. It was published by [[Currency Press]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewett|first=Robert|title=The Blonde, the Brunette and the Vengeful Redhead|year=2007|publisher=Currency Press|location=Sydney|isbn=978-0-86819-806-4|url=http://www.currency.com.au/product_detail.aspx?productid=1518&amp;ReturnUrl=/plays-general.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was premiered at the Stables Theatre in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in 2004. It was later produced at other theatres in Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, and the US.

==Synopsis==

An adulterous husband, a meddlesome neighbour and a dropped ice-cream cone are among the circumstances that combine to shatter the life of suburban housewife Rhonda Russell.

Everyone has their own story to tell about the day that Rhonda went berserk in the shopping mall. And who’s to know where the truth lies? With the best friend who might have egged her on? With the husband who denies responsibility? Or with the victim’s family whose lives were changed forever? And then there’s the story of the vengeful redhead herself, but she’s probably the least likely to know what really happened.

In this gripping adventure, the world is turned upside down in a disastrous and comic sequence of events. As the intrigue unfolds, seven different characters give a fresh twist of perspective – all played by one multifaceted performer.

==First production==
''The Blonde, the Brunette and the Vengeful Redhead'' was first produced by [[Stewart D'Arrietta]] for Saxophone Productions at the Stables Theatre, Sydney, on 26 February 2004 with the following participants:

Performer: [[Jacki Weaver]]

Director: Jennifer Hagan

Assistant Director: Sean Taylor

Designer: Laurence Eastwood

Lighting Designer: Peter Neufeld

}}
'''''The Wrong Trousers''''' is a 1993 British [[Stop motion|stop-motion animated]] short film directed by [[Nick Park]] at [[Aardman Animations]], featuring his characters [[Wallace and Gromit]]. It is the second film featuring the eccentric inventor Wallace (voiced by [[Peter Sallis]]) and his dog Gromit, following ''[[A Grand Day Out]]'' (1989)''.'' In the film, a sinister penguin uses Wallace and Gromit's robotic "Techno Trousers" to steal a diamond.

''The Wrong Trousers'' premiered in the United States on 17 December 1993, and the United Kingdom on 26 December 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/499585?view=transmission|title=The Wrong Trousers (1993)|work=BFI|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was commercially successful and won the 1993 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]. It also inspired a charity fundraising day, known as "Wrong Trousers Day", one of several events. A sequel, ''[[A Close Shave]]'', was released in 1995.

==Plot==
Wallace gives Gromit a pair of futuristic ‘techno trousers’. Wallace decides to advertise the spare bedroom to let. The room is taken by a penguin, who befriends Wallace and isolates Gromit. The penguin takes an interest in the techno trousers after seeing Gromit use their suction feet to walk on the ceiling while decorating. After Gromit is driven from the house, the penguin secretly rewires the techno trousers for radio control.

While Gromit hunts for lodgings, he discovers a wanted poster offering a reward for the capture of a criminal chicken by the name of Feathers McGraw. In fact, the "chicken" is the lodger penguin, who disguises himself by wearing a rubber glove on his head. Wallace's morning routine is interrupted when Feathers replaces his clothes with the techno trousers, and tires him out by sending him on an extended test run through town. Later, Gromit spies on Feathers as he takes measurements of the city museum. Returning home, he discovers Feathers' plans to steal a diamond from the museum.

While Wallace sleeps, Feathers marches him to the museum and uses the trousers to infiltrate the building. He uses a remotely-operated crane claw, contained in a helmet he has made Wallace wear, to capture the diamond, but triggers the alarm, waking a panicked Wallace. Feathers marches him back to the house and traps him and Gromit in a wardrobe at gunpoint.

Gromit rewires the trousers to break open the wardrobe. He and Wallace chase Feathers aboard their model train set. Wallace disarms Feathers and frees himself from the trousers. After Feathers' train collides with the trousers, Gromit captures him in a milk bottle, and he is later taken to the police, who imprison him in a city zoo. Wallace and Gromit celebrate paying off their debts with the reward money while the techno trousers, consigned to the dustbin, walk off into the sunset.

==Reception==
''The Wrong Trousers'' was voted as the eighteenth-best British television show by the British Film Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/list.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911083558/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/list.php |archivedate=11 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a unanimously positive score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with 24 reviews, 100% positive and an average score of 9.1/10. The film was awarded the Grand Prix at the [[Tampere Film Festival]] and the Grand Prix at the World Festival of Animated film – [[Animafest Zagreb]] in 1994. 

''The Wrong Trousers'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]].

In September 2018, "The Wrong Trousers" inspired the development of the exoskeleton suit for disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-36368877/how-an-exoskeleton-suit-is-helping-me-to-walk-again|title=Exoskeleton is helping me to walk again|website=BBC News|language=en|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-45552016/the-hi-tech-trousers-inspired-by-wallace-and-gromit|title=Wallace and Gromit inspire smart trousers|website=BBC News|language=en|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Topoxte''' ({{IPA|/tɒpɒʃtˈɛ/}}) (or '''Topoxté''' in [[Spanish orthography]]) is a [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[archaeological site]] in the [[Petén Basin]] in northern [[Guatemala]] with a long occupational history dating as far back as the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Preclassic]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated16&gt;Pinto &amp; Noriega 1995, pp.576–7.&lt;/ref&gt; As the capital of the [[Kowoj|Kowoj Maya]], it was the largest of the few [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] [[Mesoamerica]]n sites in the area. Topoxte is located on an island on [[Laguna Yaxhá|Yaxha Lake]] across from the important Classic period center of [[Yaxha]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated26&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.617.&lt;/ref&gt;

Topoxte was named by [[Teobert Maler]] in 1904;&lt;ref name=autogenerated30&gt;Chase 1976, p.155.&lt;/ref&gt; the name means "seed of the [[Ramón tree]]." There is no record of the name Topoxte prior to this.&lt;ref name=autogenerated30 /&gt; The Ramón tree, commonly known as breadnut, was an important component of the ancient [[Maya diet and subsistence|Maya diet]]. Prior to this the site was known as ''Islapag'', as noted in 1831 by [[Juan Galindo]] in his report to the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated30 /&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Guatemala-Peten-around-Flores.png|thumb|450px|The location of Topoxté in relation to other Maya sites in the eastern Petén.]]
Topoxte occupies five of a cluster of six islands at the western end of Lake Yaxha in the [[Municipalities of Guatemala|municipality]] of [[Melchor de Mencos]] in the eastern part of the [[Departments of Guatemala|Guatemalan department]] of [[Petén Department|Petén]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated30 /&gt; Due to the extreme fluctuations of the water level of the lake, these islands can sometimes become landlocked.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;Chase 1976, pp.155–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal occupation existed on the three islands named Topoxte, Cante and Paxte.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Pinto &amp; Noriega 1995, pp.572–3.&lt;/ref&gt; When the water level was higher the lake was connected via a natural canal to the neighbouring Lake Sacnab, which lies to the east.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Three smaller lakes lie to the west, from west to east they are lakes Chompoxte, Colorada and Coloradita.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Chase 1976, p.156.&lt;/ref&gt;

The island of Topoxte lies at an altitude of {{convert|168|m|ft}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; The island is formed from [[limestone]] with the highest elevation in the northern part of the island, sloping gently down towards the south.&lt;ref&gt;Hermes &amp; Acevedo 1992, p.265.&lt;/ref&gt;

The closest town is [[Flores, El Petén|Flores]], the capital of the Petén department, {{convert|52|km|mi}} to the west as the crow flies. Topoxte is {{convert|29|km|mi}} west of the international border with [[Belize]] and about {{convert|80|km|mi}} south of the international border with [[Mexico]]. It is {{convert|28|km|mi}} northeast of [[Zacpeten]], another important Kowoj settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Pugh &amp; Rice 2009b, p.166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Archaeological investigations have revealed that the site was occupied from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Preclassic]] right through to the Late Postclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt; [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|Obsidian]] from the [[Ixtepeque]] source started to be used from the Terminal Classic onwards and is used as a diagnostic marker for dating finds to the later periods of occupation at the site, when Ixtepeque became the principal source of obsidian for Topoxte and the wider Maya lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;Braswell et al. 2005, p.184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was abandoned at the end of the Classic period (ca. 900) and reoccupied during the Postclassic at approximately 1100.&lt;ref name=autogenerated26 /&gt;  After being inhabited for a further three and a half centuries it may finally have been abandoned around 1450, although this has now been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.617. Pugh &amp; Rice 2009a, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preclassic Period===
The site was first occupied toward the end of the Middle Preclassic,&lt;ref name=autogenerated34&gt;Hermes 1999, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; as evidenced by a number of burials and artifacts dating to this period, and the possible Late Preclassic substructure underlying Building C on Topoxte Island.&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo 1995, pp.169–234. Pinto &amp; Noriega 1995, pp.576–9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, evidence for Middle Preclassic occupation is scarce and is largely confined to the Main Plaza on Topoxte Island.&lt;ref name=autogenerated43&gt;Hermes et al. 1996, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceramic evidence indicates that there was a degree of contact with the Guatemalan highlands in the Late Preclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated43 /&gt;

===Classic Period===
Burial 49, which dates to AD 750, indicates a marriage of the Lady Twelve Guacamaya from Topoxte with a prince from [[Tikal]]. In the Terminal Classic, immediately prior to the temporary abandonment of the site, the ceramic style of Topoxte was very similar to the ceramics of [[Tikal]] and [[Uaxactun]].&lt;ref&gt;Rice &amp; Forsyth 2005, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Topoxte was a part of the Yaxha polity.&lt;ref&gt;Hermes &amp; Martínez 2005, p.143.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postclassic Period===
[[File:Parque Yaxha Nakum Naranjo Sitio Topoxte 2015-01-21-06.JPG|thumb|350px|Ceremonial architecture at Topoxte, Buildings E, D and C on the main plaza of the principal island.&lt;ref name=autogenerated20 /&gt;]]

Topoxte was an important site in the Postclassic and had close ties with the city of [[Mayapan]] in the north of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated26 /&gt; It was fortified and probably served as an important nexus in the [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade routes]] between the Maya highlands and the Yucatán.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.617. Adams 2000, p.243.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a small capital with about six temples and a similar number of open halls.&lt;ref name=autogenerated17&gt;Adams 1996, p.313.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as strong ties with Mayapan, there are striking similarities with sites of the [[Tulum]] group, indicating that these sites belong to the same specific cultural tradition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated17 /&gt;

Some plain [[stele|stelae]] were raised in the Postclassic, which were perhaps covered in [[stucco]] and painted.&lt;ref name=autogenerated26 /&gt; This may represent a revival of the [[Katun (Maya calendar)|katun]]-ending ceremonies that occurred in the Classic Period, again reflecting ties with the northern Yucatán.&lt;ref name=autogenerated26 /&gt; Strong ties with Mayapan are also reflected by the ceramic style, particularly modelled effigy incense burners.&lt;ref name=autogenerated26 /&gt;

The three principal islands were densely inhabited during the Postclassic with a great deal of construction taking place.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25&gt;Hermes &amp; Noriega 1998, p.886.&lt;/ref&gt; The site was abandoned about the same time as Mayapan, around 1450,&lt;ref name=autogenerated26 /&gt; when the [[Kowoj|Kowoj Maya]], moved their capital west to [[Zacpetén]] Island in the Salpetén lake, near the [[Peten Itza]] lake.

===Colonial history===
Spanish missionaries Fuensalida and Orbita are said to have passed by Lake Yaxha in 1618, at which time they reported that there appeared to be no inhabitants, indicating that the site had already been abandoned by this time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; However, it has been suggested that their indigenous guides deliberately led them via a neighbouring lake in order to mislead them into thinking that the Yaxhá region was uninhabited.&lt;ref&gt;Chase 1976, pp.156–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The mention of Lake Yaxha by these missionaries is the only mention of the lake in colonial period records.&lt;ref&gt;Chase 1976, p.157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
Although he probably never visited the site, the existence of Topoxte was first reported by Juan Galindo in 1831, in his report to the Society of Antiquaries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated30 /&gt; [[Teoberto Maler]] spent three days at the site in 1904, clearing the site core and describing Building C and recording 9 stela-altar pairs. [[Sylvanus Morley]] visited Topoxte in 1914, describing the sculptured stelae of the site, including 2 on Cante Island. In 1933 Cyrus L. Lundell and L. C. Stuart made a new plan of the main plaza and assigned the nomenclature to the structures that is still used today. William R. Bullard carried out excavations at Topoxte from 1958 to 1960 and identified the Postclassic occupation of the site. Further excavations were carried out in 1973 and 1974 by Don and Prudence Rice, on Cante Island.&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo et al. 1997, pp.640–641.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was damaged by [[Illicit antiquities|looters]] in the 1970s and 80s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated41&gt;Pinto &amp; Noriega 1995, p.574.&lt;/ref&gt; PRONAT (''Proyecto Nacional Tikal'') undertook clearing and restoration work at Topoxte in 1989, including the erection of scaffolding and a protective roof on Building C, the main temple.&lt;ref&gt;Pinto &amp; Noriega 1995, pp.575–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological investigations of the site were undertaken from 1991 to 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The site==
The principal ruins of the pre-Columbian city are spread over three islands:Topoxte, Cante and Paxte, in the southwest of Yaxha Lake, of which Topoxte is the largest.&lt;ref name=autogenerated32&gt;Hermes &amp; Noriega 1998, p.880.&lt;/ref&gt; All three of these islands were densely occupied, with all construction except the ceremonial architecture being aligned according to the local topography.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25 /&gt;

===Paxte Island===
Paxte Island is the smallest of the three principal islands with a surface area of approximately {{convert|3|ha|sqft}}.&lt;ref name="autogenerated880"&gt;Hermes &amp; Noriega 1998, p.880. Acevedo et al. 1997, p.641.&lt;/ref&gt; It is about {{convert|100|m|ft|0}} west of Topoxte Island.&lt;ref name=autogenerated32 /&gt; 68 structures have been identified on Paxte, mostly low rectangular platforms built from unworked limestone, presumably the remains of domestic buildings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated880"/&gt; There are two groups of larger buildings located on the highest part of the island, aligned north-south, a fact that distinguishes them from the smaller residential buildings, which are aligned according to the local topography.&lt;ref name=autogenerated32 /&gt; Excavations suggest that Paxte was occupied from the Late Postclassic into the Postclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated29&gt;Pugh &amp; Rice 2009a, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cante Island===
Cante Island has a surface area of approximately {{convert|6.5|ha|sqft}}, with a steep slope on the east side and a gentler slope on the west side.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;Acevedo et al 1997, p.641.&lt;/ref&gt; Cante lies to the west of Paxte Island and contains the remains of 142 structures that have been mapped.&lt;ref name=autogenerated32 /&gt; The main group is organised around a plaza but the majority of the buildings were arranged according to the local topography.&lt;ref name=autogenerated32 /&gt; Almost all the structures of Cante are medium-sized rectangular platforms.&lt;ref name=autogenerated32 /&gt; Like Paxte, Cante appears to have been occupied from the Late Postclassic into the Postclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated29 /&gt; Sylvanus Morley found 2 sculpted stelae on the island in 1914, they have been dated to the Late Classic.&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo et al. 1997, p.640.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topoxte Island===
[[File:Maler p58 Fig 10 Topoxté Sketch Plan of the Ruins.png|thumb|right|Plan of the ruins as published in 1908 by Teoberto Maler]]
Topoxte Island measures roughly {{convert|450|m|ft}} from north to south and {{convert|400|m|ft}} from east to west, it has a crescent shape with a bay on the west side.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; It is the largest of the three principal islands and contains the remains of around 100 structures, as well as the principal ceremonial centre of the city.&lt;ref name=autogenerated32 /&gt; The largest structures are largely concentrated in two groups in the centre and in the north of the island.&lt;ref name=autogenerated32 /&gt;

Topoxte Island had a surge in construction activity in the Postclassic suggesting a population influx at this time, in parallel to an equivalent influx into the area of [[Lake Petén Itzá]] region in response to the collapse of [[Chichen Itza]] in the north of the Yucatán Peninsula.&lt;ref name=autogenerated29 /&gt; The ceremonial architecture at Topoxte includes two major periods of construction in the Late Postclassic and closely reflects that at [[Zacpeten]], another Kowoj site, and also seems to be linked to activity at Mayapan.&lt;ref&gt;Pugh &amp; Rice 2009a, p.112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten different construction phases are apparent in the [[archaeology|archaeological record]] of Topoxte.&lt;ref name=autogenerated34 /&gt;  The first three phases date to the Preclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated34 /&gt; There are three distinctive groups at the site, two 5&amp;nbsp;meter tall platforms, and a low residential area consisting of more than 100 structures.  The site’s central plaza is bounded by 3 temples constructed in the Postclassic [[architecture|architectural]] style similar to structures at Mayapan (incorporating vertical walls, columns and flat stone ceilings).&lt;ref name=autogenerated26 /&gt;

The ruins on the island of Topoxte start about four meters above the current level of Lake Yaxha, indicating that the Postclassic water level was roughly the same as present, or perhaps slightly higher.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; The site was laid out in a manner very similar to the contemporary site of [[Nojpetén|Tayasal]] on [[Lake Petén Itzá]], now covered by the modern town of [[Flores, El Petén|Flores]], with buildings on the north, south and east side of the main plaza and the west side open to the lake and the sunset.&lt;ref name=autogenerated41 /&gt; The stone buildings of Topoxte were all built with limestone.&lt;ref name=autogenerated41 /&gt;

The '''Main Plaza''' is built upon an artificial platform constructed with more than {{convert|9|m|ft}} of fill.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14&gt;Pinto &amp; Noriega 1995, p.573.&lt;/ref&gt; It is roughly rectangular with a surface area of approximately {{convert|1410|m2|ft2}}, it is one of the highest plazas on the island.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; The plaza is open on the west side and bordered on the north by Building G, on the south by Building B and on the east by Buildings C, D and E.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; The majority of worked monuments at Topoxte are located in the southwest corner of this plaza.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; The Main Plaza was the focus of activity from very early in the history of the site, with an offering dating to the Middle Preclassic being found in front of Building E and further Middle Preclassic evidence being found in deep levels in front of Building D.&lt;ref&gt;Hermes &amp; Acevedo 1992, p.256. Hermes et al. 1996, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the plaza did not reach its maximum size until the Postclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Hermes &amp; Noriega 1998, p.881.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Building C====
{{multiple image|align=right|total_width=400|image1=Topoxté 3.jpg|caption1=Building C at Topoxté|image2=Maler Upper Usumatcintla Plate 14 Topoxté Main Temple.png|caption2=Rear view of Building C as published by Teoberto Maler in 1908|width2=237}}
[[File:Maler p59 Fig 11 Topoxté Ground-plan and section of Main Temple.png|thumb|right|Maler's plan of Building C]]
'''Building C''' is perhaps the best example of Postclassic architecture in the Petén region.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; It is located on the east side of the Main Plaza and is a stepped pyramid with three platforms, measuring {{convert|2.45|m|ft}}, {{convert|2.2|m|ft}} and {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; The pyramid has a steep stairway ascending from the plaza on the west side of the building at an angle of 49°.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt;

A fourth level is built upon the three platforms, with its own access stairway climbing from the top platform.  This fourth level supported the temple building, which originally had walls approximately {{convert|4.8|m|ft}} high and {{convert|0.8|m|in}} thick.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; A broken stela fragment measuring {{convert|69|by|50|cm|in}} by {{convert|23|cm|in}} was found on the third tier, in front of the access stairway to the temple.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Pinto &amp; Noriega 1995, p.578.&lt;/ref&gt; It was associated with an offering of human bones (Burial 22).

The temple building was divided into two rooms covering an area of {{convert|10.9|by|6.8|m|ft}}. The rooms were divided by a wall and two columns, and a {{convert|10|cm|in|adj=on}} step.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; The entrance to the temple is divided into three {{convert|1|m|ft|adj=on}} wide sections divided by two columns.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; The stone construction was originally covered with stucco or whitewash.&lt;ref name=autogenerated41 /&gt; The building was damaged in modern times by two looters' pits, one at the base and one near the top.&lt;ref&gt;Pinto &amp; Noriega 1995, pp.574–5.&lt;/ref&gt; During investigation of the upper pit, Burial 21 was discovered.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21&gt;Pinto &amp; Noriega 1995, p.577.&lt;/ref&gt; A second burial (Burial 23) was found in the third tier of the pyramid during restoration work.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

Building C was built upon a previous structure dating to the end of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]] or the beginning of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Classic]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated27&gt;Pinto &amp; Noriega 1995, p.579.&lt;/ref&gt; This earlier building was enlarged in the Postclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated27 /&gt;

====Other structures====
'''Building A''' is the only large building that can be assigned to the Late Classic. It was formed of a three-tier stepped platform supporting a small temple, perhaps sporting a [[roof comb]]. This building was badly damaged in the Postclassic when it was quarried for building stone for later buildings, completely stripping away the facade.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;Hermes et al. 1996, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Building B''' is a long, north-facing palace-type structure standing on the south side of the Main Plaza.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt;

'''Building D''' and Building E are built on the same platform on the east side of the Main Plaza, immediately to the north of Building C.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; Building D is a rectangular platform with rounded corners.&lt;ref name=autogenerated43 /&gt;

'''Structure E''' occupied the same platform as Building D.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; The structure was part of a temple complex.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15&gt;Pugh &amp; Rice 2009a, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; It shows two construction phases with the earlier taking place around 1200.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15 /&gt;

'''Building G''' is a small square structure on the north side of the Main Plaza.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; It faces southward onto the plaza.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt;

'''Structure J''' is a low platform in the middle of the plaza opposite the stairway of Structure C. It is poorly preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Chase 1976, p.163.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Building K''' is on the east side of the Main Plaza and once supported two Late Classic stelae.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;

====Burials====
As of 1995, 26 burials had been excavated at Topoxte.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.171.&lt;/ref&gt; Two burials were interred in rough [[cist]]s, two were interred in caves and one in a funerary urn.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt; Eighteen burials were individual, four were multiple burials and four consisted of single burials with additional skulls interred with the deceased.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;

'''Burial 1''' dates to the Postclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.174.&lt;/ref&gt; It was excavated in a possible residential patio among a group of small buildings at the south end of Topoxte island.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; It was possibly interred in a seated position.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The remains belong to an adult male aged between 15 and 25 years old and were found buried with fragments of [[Tortoiseshell material|tortoiseshell]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

'''Burial 2''' was found in the south of Topoxte island.&lt;ref name=autogenerated23&gt;Acevedo 1995, pp.175–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains belong to an adult male between 25 and 35 years old and were oriented north-south.&lt;ref name=autogenerated23 /&gt; Associated offerings included an [[earthenware]] bowl and a necklace consisting of four shell or bone beads.&lt;ref name=autogenerated23 /&gt; This burial dates to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated23 /&gt;

'''Burial 3''' was found in the south of Topoxte island.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.176.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains are those of an adult male aged from 25 to 35 years old and are mixed with the bones of a second individual.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Associated offerings include two [[obsidian]] [[prismatic blade]]s. The burial dates to the Early Classic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

'''Burial 4''' was excavated from an artificial terrace near the northwest corner of Building A and dates to the Postclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains belonged to an adult female between 17 and 25 years old.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt; She was buried with a broken copper disk and a piece of flint.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt;

'''Burial 5''' was excavated from a residential area in the northwest of Topoxte island. The remains were those of a child between 2 and 4 years old, possibly buried in a seated position.&lt;ref name=autogenerated38&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.178.&lt;/ref&gt; A shell bead was found under the skull.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt; The age of the remains is uncertain, but they may date to the Preclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated38 /&gt;

'''Burial 6''' was partially excavated from the extreme southeastern edge of the island, the remains are those of an adult and were apparently interred outside of the limits of the urban area of the site.&lt;ref name=autogenerated38 /&gt; The gender of the remains is uncertain but they have been tentatively identified as female and date to the Early Classic.&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo 1995, pp.178–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burial 7''' was found in a residential area in the northern part of Topoxte island.&lt;ref name=autogenerated24&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.179.&lt;/ref&gt; Only about 10% of the remains were recovered, they belong to an adult tentatively identified as male.&lt;ref name=autogenerated24 /&gt; The remains were buried with the head aligned towards the south and were associated with two pieces of worked flint.&lt;ref name=autogenerated24 /&gt; They date to the Postclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated24 /&gt;

'''Burial 8''' dates to the Postclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated33&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.181.&lt;/ref&gt; It was excavated from the western edge of Building E, which is located by the Main Plaza.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.180.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains are those of an adult male between 17 and 25 years old.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; A second skull was found interred with the burial, belonging to an adult female of similar age to the principal remains.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

'''Burial 9''' dates to the Postclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.182.&lt;/ref&gt; The bones are those of an adult male between 17 and 25 years old.&lt;ref name=autogenerated33 /&gt; The remains were interred with a prismatic blade of grey obsidian, they were found in a columned building in the extreme north of Topoxte island.&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo 1995, pp.181–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burial 10''' was found in the northern extreme of Topoxte island, the remains are those of an adult male and date to the Postclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo 1995, pp.182–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Interred with the deceased were a worked flint and a piece of [[slate]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;

'''Burial 11''' was associated with an altar platform to the west of Building E, in the Main Plaza.&lt;ref name=autogenerated36&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.183.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains are those of an adult of indeterminate gender, between 15 and 25 years old.&lt;ref name=autogenerated36 /&gt; Two pieces of flint were buried with the remains, which date to the Postclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated36 /&gt;

'''Burial 12''' is located to the south of a low residential platform, upon an artificial terrace in the north of Topoxte island.&lt;ref name=autogenerated36 /&gt; The burial contains the remains of two or possibly three individuals.&lt;ref name=autogenerated36 /&gt; Various items were associated with the burial, such as a fragment of a flint knife and another of grey obsidian, and several pieces of bone needle.&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.184.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the skeletons belongs to an adult female between 17 and 25 years of age, the other is that of a child of between 5 and 8 years of age, they both date to the Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo 1995, pp.184–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burial 13''' was found to the south of Building G, in the Main Plaza, and may have been interred at the time that the plaza was levelled.&lt;ref name=autogenerated35&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.185.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains are those of an adult, possibly female, between 25 and 40 years old.&lt;ref name=autogenerated35 /&gt; The burial is associated with several pieces of flint and obsidian and dates to the Early Classic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated35 /&gt;

'''Burial 14''' was interred near the northeastern shore of Topoxte island, near a residential complex.&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.186.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of two individuals, an adult male between 17 and 25 years old and a seated adult female between 25 and 35 years old.&lt;ref name=autogenerated42&gt;Acevedo 1995, pp.186–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The burial dates from the Postclassic Period.&lt;ref name=autogenerated42 /&gt;

'''Burial 15''' was found to the north of Building H, on an artificial elevation near the centre of Topoxte island, among mixed residential and non-residential buildings.&lt;ref name=autogenerated40&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.187.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains are those of an adult, tentatively identified as female and of unknown age.&lt;ref name=autogenerated40 /&gt; The burial dates to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.188.&lt;/ref&gt; Associated offerings included an inverted ceramic vessel, a flint projectile point, a grey obsidian prismatic blade, a shell disk, two perforated ceramic disks and various other pieces of worked flint. Some of these items may actually be rubbish dumped on top of the burial, with only the inverted vessel being a definite offering associated with the human remains.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The burial dates to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

'''Burial 16''' was found under a patio in the central area of Topoxte island, to the east of some relatively tall structures.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The remains are those of an adult, possibly male, aged between 17 and 25 years old.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The burial dates to the Postclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo 1995, pp.188–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burial 17''' were excavated from an artificial terrace in east of the centre of Topoxte island, immediately to the southeast of a residential complex.&lt;ref name=autogenerated31&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.189.&lt;/ref&gt; The burial contains the remains of three individuals.&lt;ref name=autogenerated31 /&gt; The first was an adult male over 30 years old, buried in a seated position with a couple of associated pieces of flint. The remains date to the Postclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated31 /&gt; The second individual was buried prone, oriented northwards, they have been tentatively identified as a male of unknown age.&lt;ref name=autogenerated28&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.190.&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred in the Late Classic with a ceramic vessel, a ceramic bowl and a ceramic disk.&lt;ref name=autogenerated28 /&gt; The third individual is represented only by a skull, which belonged to a child of between 2 and 5 years of age.&lt;ref name=autogenerated28 /&gt; The skull was associated with various Early Classic artifacts but it is unclear if it dates from the same period or was deposited during the Postclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated39&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.191.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burial 18''' was found close to the junction of the lowest tier of Building C with the main stairway of the pyramid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated39 /&gt; The burial dates to the Postclassic and consists of three individuals.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19&gt;Acevedo 1995, pp.191–2.&lt;/ref&gt; They are of indeterminate gender, one being aged between 12 and 18 years old, the second being aged between 16 and 25 years old and the other being aged between 25 and 35 years old.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19 /&gt; The entire burial dates to the Postclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.192.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burial 19''' was found in the southern part of Topoxte island, under the platform supporting Building A.&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.193.&lt;/ref&gt; The burial consists of two individuals and two additional skulls.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;Acevedo 1995, pp.193–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Both individuals are adult males of between 17 and 25 years of age, with offerings consisting of a shell and various pieces of worked stone including flint, limestone and jasper.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; The entire burial has been dated to the Protoclassic (AD 0–250).&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo 1995, pp.193–6. Hermes 1999, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burial 20''' was located in a system of artificial caves in the southern part of the island, near Building A.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.196.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of an adult of indeterminate age and gender associated with a great deal of mixed rubbish. The remains date to the Protoclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

'''Burial 21''' was found under the temple at the summit of Building C when archaeologists investigated a looters' tunnel.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21 /&gt; It dates to the Postclassic and was an adult male aged between 35 and 50 years of age, lying horizontally with an east-west orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Pinto &amp; Noriega 1995, p.577. Acevedo 1995, p.197.&lt;/ref&gt; There were few graves goods recovered, a monochrome vessel with a lid containing three small pieces of [[jade]], a piece of [[quartz]] crystal, a shell bead and some pieces of [[turquoise]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated21 /&gt;

'''Burial 22''' is a collection of disarticulated longbones, belonging to a young child of between 2½ to 4 years old, buried at the base of a stela on the third tier of Building C.&lt;ref&gt;Pinto &amp; Noriega 1995, p.578. Acevedo 1995, p.198.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burial 23''' was found inserted into the east side of the third tier of Building C.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; The burial was contained in a cist, with the remains aligned north-south.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; The skull was missing and the burial had no associated grave goods.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; The remains belonged to an adult female of between 23 and 30 years of age and date to the Postclassic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated37&gt;Acevedo 1995, p.199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[archeology]], a '''uniface''' is a specific type of stone tool that has been flaked on one surface only. There are two general classes of uniface tools: modified flakes&amp;mdash;and formalized tools, which display deliberate, systematic modification of the marginal edges, evidently formed for a specific purpose. 

== Modified flakes ==
While many worked stone tools can be technically designated as "modified flakes," for [[lithic analysis]] purposes a '''modified flake''' is usually defined as a [[lithic flake]] with one or more edges that were altered either through opportunistic use or through nonsystematic retouching; it is often difficult to identify the process that produced the observed edge. Opportunistic use occurs when a sharp flake is used as-is, without edge-modification. Nonsystematic retouching occurs when [[pressure flaking]] is used to remove a few trimming flakes from the edge, in no discernible or extensive pattern.

== Formalized uniface tools ==
Some unifaces are characterized by systematic edge retouch, which was used to thin, straighten, sharpen, and smooth an artifact's edge, and were usually created with a specific purpose in mind. These '''formalized unifaces''' were often intended for woodworking, cutting, chopping, or hide-working purposes, and generally fall into easily classifiable types. While the following discussion does not cover some specialized types of unifaces, it does include the most common types.

[[Scraper (archaeology)|Scrapers]] are unifacial tools that were used either for hideworking or woodworking. Whereas this term is often used for any unifacially flaked tool that defies classification, most lithic analysts maintain that the only true scrapers are defined on the base of use-wear, and are usually worked at their distal ends—i.e., "[[end scraper]]s." Other scrapers include the so-called "[[side scraper]]s." Most scrapers are either oval or blade-like in shape. The working edges of scrapers tend to be convex, and many have trimmed and dulled lateral edges to facilitate hafting. One important variety of scraper is the [[thumbnail scraper]], a scraper shaped much like its namesake. This scraper type is common at [[Paleo-Indian]] sites.

[[Chisel#Gouge|Gouges]] (or [[adze]]s) may be either bifacial or unifacial, and are defined as tools with chisel-like working edges that were used for woodworking purposes; they may also have been used to remove marrow from bones. Gouges are generally triangular in shape, with the working edge—characteristically steep-angled—appearing at the wide base of the triangle. The opposite edge, at the point of the triangle, was the hafted end; the tool itself was generally hafted at right angles to the handle.

[[Denticulate tool]]s display edges that are worked into a multiply notched shape, much like the toothed edge of a saw. Indeed, these tools might have been used as saws, more likely for meat processing than for wood. It is possible, however, that some or all of these notches were used for smoothing wooden shafts or for similar purposes.

The '''Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa''' (''[[Enuma Anu Enlil]]'' Tablet 63) refers to the record of astronomical observations of [[Venus]], as preserved in numerous [[cuneiform]] [[clay tablet|tablet]]s dating from the first millennium BC. It is believed that this astronomical record was first compiled during the reign of King [[Ammisaduqa]] (or Ammizaduga), the fourth ruler after [[Hammurabi]]. Thus, the origins of this text should probably be dated to around the mid-seventeenth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Russell |last=Hobson |title=The Exact Transmission of Texts in the First Millennium B.C. |type=PhD thesis |publisher=[[University of Sydney]] |date=2009 |url=http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/5404/1/r-hobson-2009-thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (according to the [[Middle Chronology]]).

The tablet recorded the rise times of [[Venus]] and its first and last visibility on the horizon before or after sunrise and sunset (the [[heliacal risings]] and settings of Venus) in the form of lunar dates. These observations are recorded for a period of 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=John David |last=North |author-link=John North (historian) |title=Cosmos: an illustrated history of astronomy and cosmology |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |date=2008 |page=41 |isbn=0-226-59441-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The sources==
This Venus tablet is part of ''[[Enuma anu enlil]]'' ("In the days of Anu and Enlil"), a long text dealing with [[Babylonian astrology]], which mostly consists of [[omen]]s interpreting celestial phenomena.

The earliest copy of this tablet to be published, a 7th-century BC [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]],  part of the [[British Museum]] collections, was recovered from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|library at Nineveh]]. It was first published in 1870 by Henry Creswicke Rawlinson and [[George Smith (assyriologist)|George Smith]] as ''Enuma Anu Enlil'' Tablet 63, in "Tablet of Movements of the Planet Venus and their Influences" (''The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia'', volume III).

As many as 20 copies of this text are currently on record, many of them fragmentary, falling into 6 groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Erica |last1=Reiner |author-link1=Erica Reiner |first2=David Edwin |last2=Pingree |author-link2=David Pingree |title=Babylonian planetary omens |volume=Volume 3 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |date=1998 |isbn=90-5693-011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest of these copies is believed to be Source "B", found at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] in 1924. It was copied from a tablet written at Babylon while [[Sargon II]] was King of [[Assyria]] between 720 and 704 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hermann |last1=Hunger |author-link1=Hermann Hunger |first2=David Edwin |last2=Pingree |author-link2=David Pingree |title=Astral sciences in Mesopotamia |series=Handbuch der Orientalistik |volume=Volume 44 |page=32 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |date=1999 |isbn=90-04-10127-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Several dates for the original observations, as contained in the tablet, were proposed early in the 20th century. The following dates, corresponding to the High, [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|Middle]], [[Short chronology timeline|Low]] and [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|Ultra-Low Chronologies]], were inferred for the beginning of the Venus observations: [[1702 BC]], [[1646 BC]], [[1582 BC]], 1550 BC, respectively.

The tablet's significance for corroborating [[Babylonia]]n chronology was first recognised by [[Franz Xaver Kugler]] in 1912, when he succeeded in identifying the enigmatic "Year of the Golden Throne" ("Venus" tablet K.160) as potentially the 8th year of the reign of Ammisaduqa, based on one of his year names. 
&lt;ref&gt;Franz Xaver Kugler, Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel - II. Buch: Natur, Mythus und Geschichte als Grundlagen babylonischer Zeitordnung, nebst eingehenden Untersuchungen der älteren Sternkunde und Meteorologie, 2. Teil. Heft 1, Aschendorff, 1912&lt;/ref&gt;
Since then, this 7th-century BC copy has been variously interpreted to support [[Chronology of the Ancient Orient|several chronologies]] in the [[2nd millennium BC]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1982JHA....13...23W&amp;classic=YES] Weir, J. D, The Venus Tablets - a Fresh Approach, Journal for the History of Astronomy, vol. 13, pp. 23, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Many uncertainties remain about the interpretation of the record of astronomical observations of Venus, as preserved in these surviving tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote=We then discuss why the 56/64 year Venus cycle cannot be traced in the Venus Tablet and therefore cannot serve as an anchor for the search of chronologies. |last=Gurzadyan |first=V.

Problems of atmospheric refraction were addressed by [[Vahe Gurzadyan]] in a 2003 publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=V. G. |last=Gurzadyan |arxiv=physics/0311036 |title=The Venus Tablet and refraction |journal=Akkadica |volume=124 |date=2003 |pages=13–17 |publisher=Assyriological Center Georges Dossin |location=Brussels|bibcode = 2003physics..11036G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry for some years, notably 13 and 21 are not physically possible and are considered in error. Also, the tables used to calculate the helical rising of Venus assume a rate at which the earth is slowing, a rate which is not certain, causing "clock-time errors".&lt;ref&gt;John D. Weir, The Pattern of Venus Tablet Solutions, JACF, vol. 7, pp.70-76, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Verdaille''' is a painting executed entirely or primarily in shades of green. Such a painting is described as having been painted "''en verdaille''".&lt;ref name="Sale1380"&gt; Christie’s, ''Sale 1380, Old Master Paintings'', lot 49, New York, Christie’s, 17 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;   

''Verdaille'' has its roots in 12th century [[stained glass]] made for [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monasteries, which prohibited the use of colored art in 1134. Such paintings are less common than paintings executed in grey (''[[grisaille]]'') or in brown (''[[brunaille]]'').&lt;ref name="Sale1380"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7378">'''Vital heat''', also called '''innate''' or '''natural heat''', or '''''calidum innatum''''', is a term in [[Ancient Greek medicine]] and [[philosophy]] that has generally referred to the heat produced within the body, usually the heat produced by the [[heart]] and the [[circulatory system]].  Vital heat was a somewhat controversial subject because it was formerly believed that heat was acquired by an outside source such as the element of fire.
[[File:Gray491.png|thumb|border|right|The human heart, thought to be the source of vital heat]]

==Origin of concept==

It was a previously accepted concept that heat was absorbed through external sources, however the concept of vital heat was more or less stumbled upon by a physiological observation that associates cold with the dead and heat with the living.  "For the concept of vital heat we may--somewhat arbitrarily-- take our starting point in Parmenides.  His correlation of dead with cold, alive with warm, may not have been primarily intended as a contribution to physiology, yet the physiological significance of this thought was perceived by his successors; witness Empedocles, who taught 'sleep comes about when the heat of the blood is cooled to the proper degree, death when it becomes altogether cold'".&lt;ref name=Solsmen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solsmen|first=Friedrich|title=The Vital Heat, The Inborn Pneuma, and the Aether|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|year=1957|volume=77|issue=Part 1|pages=119–123|jstor=628643 |doi=10.2307/628643}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle would eventually modify this doctrine stating that "sleep is a temporary overpowering of the inner heat by other factors in the body, death its final extinction."&lt;ref name="Solsmen"/&gt;

==Vital heat and ancient medicine==
[[File:Ancientgreek surgical.jpg|thumb|Tools of Ancient Greek medicine]]
According to [[Ancient Greek]] physicians, vital heat was produced by the [[heart]], maintained by the ''[[pneuma]]'' (air, breath, [[spirit]] or [[soul]]), and circulated throughout the body by blood vessels, which were thought to be intact tubes using blood to transmit heat. [[Aristotle]] supported this argument by showing that when the heart is made cold compared to other organs, the individual dies. He believed that the heat produced in the heart caused blood to react in a similar way to boiling, expanding out through the blood vessels with every beat. This extreme heat, according to him, can lead to a [[spontaneous human combustion|self-consuming flame]] if it is not cooled by air from the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;Lutz, Peter. ''The Rise of Experimental Biology''. Humana Press. 2002. {{ISBN|0-89603-835-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galen]] wrote in ''On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body'' (170): "The heart is, as it were, the hearthstone and source of the innate heat by which the animal is governed." In the 11th century, [[Avicenna]] agreed with this notion, stating that the heart produced [[breath]], the "vital power or innate heat" within the body, in his ''Canon of Medicine''.&lt;ref&gt;Findlen, Paula. "[http://www.stanford.edu/class/history13/earlysciencelab/body/heartpages/heart.html The History of the Heart]". ''History of the Body''. Stanford University. URL accessed 2006-05-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the term ''innate heat'' was attributed to friction caused by the motion of blood through arteries, as evidenced by the ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1728):

:"For 'tis hence we know, that this ''innate Heat'' is no more than the Attrition of the Parts of the Blood; occasion'd by its circulatory Motion, especially in the Arteries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=1728 |author=Chambers, Ephraim |url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0293&amp;q1=Attrition%20of%20the%20Parts%20of%20the%20Blood |title=Cyclopædia, or, An universal dictionary of arts and sciences  |accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristotle's views==
Aristotle believed that the source of vital heat lies in the heart and is intimately connected to the soul. "This link is not for Aristotle simply an accidental connection, but rather the existence of vital heat is necessitated by the most basic living activity: [[nutrition]]. In De anima ii 4.416b28-29, Aristotle says: 'All food must be capable of being digested, and that whose activity causes [[digestion]] is heat. For this reason, every animate thing has heat.'".&lt;ref name=Studtmann&gt;{{cite journal|last=Studtmann|first=Paul|title=Living Capacities and Vital Heat in Aristotle|journal=Ancient Philosophy|year=2004|volume=24|issue=2|pages=365–379|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/collection/authorizedshow?id=ancientphil_2004_0024_0002_0365_0380&amp;file_type=pdf&amp;page=1|accessdate=23 March 2014|doi=10.5840/ancientphil200424247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although prominent scholars like Aristotle accepted this concept of innate heat and its role in digestion, there were others who were skeptical and retained a different point of view.  "However, if we look for antecedents of Aristotle's theories, the most important are probably to found in the ''Timaeus''.  Here Plato shows in some detail how in respiration the 'Hot' in us is cooled by the air which enters from outside, and he relies on the cutting power of the fire, which here is identical to the 'Hot', to explain the process of digestion &lt;ref name="Solsmen"/&gt;

[[File:52-aspetti di vita quotidiana, amore,Taccuino Sanitatis, Cas.jpg|thumb|border|right|[[Aristotle]] believed that vital heat played a vital role in reproduction.]]
Along with his theory of the role of vital heat in nutrition and digestion, Aristotle believed that vital heat played a role in reproduction which includes several physical parts of the body different from the parts that participate in nutrition. Aristotle believed that blood was created through the process of digestion via vital heat and then pushed to the extremities of the body. However, blood is not in its final form but is transformed to a final substance to be used for the nourishment of the body. "Aristotle holds that semen is nutriment in its final stage of concoction before it becomes part of the body. Hence, blood, before it turns into flesh, bones, etc., first turns into semen."&lt;ref name=Studtmann /&gt;  Although blood is not in its final form, it can still be used to nourish the body and create flesh and bone. "Young males do not have semen because the conversion into flesh and bone must be done quickly owing to their rapid growth. And women do not have semen because they are not as hot as men and so lack the power of concocting blood into semen."&lt;ref name=Studtmann /&gt;  Blood in women is then naturally used to explain the [[menses]].  Therefore, when a male and female copulate and semen is emitted in the woman, the menses and the semen mix and begin a process that creates a new organism. "That it is the heat of the semen that gives it the power to concoct the menses is shown, according to Aristotle by the fact that in some insects which do not produce semen the female inserts a part of her body into the male which then is acted upon by the heat of the male".&lt;ref name=Studtmann /&gt;

'''''Who Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity''''' (2004) is a treatise by [[political scientist]] and [[historian]] [[Samuel P. Huntington]] (1927–2008). The book attempts to understand the nature of [[American identity]] and the challenges it will face in the future.&lt;ref name="TOC of book on Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|title=Table of contents for Who are we? : the challenges to America's national identity / Samuel P. Huntington|url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0645/2004042902-t.html|website=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Describing American identity==
In describing the American identity, Huntington first contests the notion that the country is, as often repeated, "a nation of immigrants". He writes that America's founders were not [[Immigration|immigrants]], but [[Settler|settlers]], since British settlers came to North America to establish a new society, as opposed to migrating from one existing society to another one as immigrants do. Later peoples who joined the culture present in the original British colonies, already established by these settlers, were indeed immigrants.

Many people point to the [[American Creed]] as the core of American identity. Huntington defines the American Creed as embodying the "principles of liberty, equality, individualism, representative government, and private property".&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 41"&gt;{{cite book|title=Who Are We?  The Challenges to America's National Identity|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Huntington asks:&lt;blockquote&gt;Would America be the America it is today if in the 17th and 18th centuries it had been settled not by British Protestants but by French, Spanish, or Portuguese Catholics? The answer is no. It would not be America; it would be Quebec, Mexico, or Brazil.&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 59"&gt;Who Are We?, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Huntington argues that, of all the nations in Europe, and of all the colonies, America alone developed the American Creed, and that this simple observation requires explanation. This observation leads to two conclusions: that America was an English colony, and that America alone was formed as a result of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].

To advance his argument about the contribution to America of its English heritage, he says:

{{Quotation|The political and legal institutions the settlers created in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries embodied in large part the institutions and practices of England's late-sixteenth-century and early-seventeenth-century "[[Tudor constitution]]."  These included: the concept of a fundamental law superior to and limiting government; the fusion of executive, legislative, and judicial functions and the division of power among separate institutions and governments; the relative power of the legislature and chief executive; the merger of the "dignified" and "efficient" functions in the chief executive; a two-house legislature; the responsibility of the legislature to their local constituencies; a legislative committee system; and primary reliance for defense on militia rather than a standing army.&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 60"&gt;Who Are We?, pp. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

As for the importance of [[Protestantism]], Huntington states: "The American Creed is the unique creation of a dissenting [[Protestant culture]]". In particular, he highlights the:

{{Quotation|Protestant emphasis on the individual conscience and the responsibility of individuals to learn God's truths directly from the Bible promoted American commitment to individualism, equality, and the rights to freedom of religion and opinion.  Protestantism stressed the work ethic and the responsibility of the individual for his own success or failure in life…With its congregational forms of church organization, Protestantism fostered opposition to hierarchy and the assumption that similar democratic forms should be employed in government.&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 68"&gt;Who Are We?, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

==Challenges to American identity==
Huntington argues that it is during the 1960s that American identity begins to erode. This was the result of several factors:

*The beginning of [[economic globalization]] and the rise of global subnational identities
*The easing of the [[Cold War]] and its end in 1989 reduced the importance of [[national identity]]
*Attempts by candidates for political offices to [[identity politics|win over groups of voters]]
*The desire of subnational group leaders to enhance the status of their respective groups and their personal status within them
*The interpretation of [[Act of Congress|Congressional acts]] that led to their execution in expedient ways, but not necessarily in the ways the framers intended
*The passing on of feelings of sympathy and guilt for past actions as encouraged by academic elites and intellectuals
*The changes in views of [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] as promoted by [[Civil rights law|civil rights]] and [[Immigration law|immigration laws]]

Huntington places the passage and subsequent misinterpretation of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] at the center of government actions that eroded the American Creed. Huntington writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Senator Hubert Humphrey, the floor manager of the bill, assured the Senate that nothing in the bill gave courts or executive agencies the power "to require hiring, firing, or promotion of employees in order to meet a racial 'quota' or to achieve a certain balance…Title VII prohibits discrimination…[and] is designed to encourage hiring on the basis of ability and qualifications, not race or religion."&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 147"&gt;Who Are We?, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;Yet these acts gave rise to a system of quotas and affirmative action, so that "the Court derived from Title VII a legal requirement that the proponents of the law had expressly disclaimed".&lt;ref name="Colorblind"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Color-Blind Constitution | first=Andrew | last=Kull | year=1992}}, pp. 214-216&lt;/ref&gt;

Another component of American identity that Huntington sees as under attack is the use of [[English language|English]]. Up until the late 20th century, English has been the dominant language of America and was actively taught to immigrants. This was not only because Americans throughout history had spoken this language, but also because, with a variety of languages brought by different immigrant groups to the United States, teaching everyone to learn to speak and write English ensured communication among these groups. This tradition was inadvertently undermined by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of "national origin". The act was interpreted to mean that potential voters who did not speak English were entitled to assistance under this "national origin" clause so that they would not be disadvantaged. This led to bilingual voting ballots and the beginning of bilingual education. In 1974, the Civil Rights Act "was amended to require schools to provide instruction in a student's native language and culture 'to the extent necessary to allow the child to progress effectively through the education system.{{Single double}} However, Huntington states that the result was, as stated by 1985 [[United States Secretary of Education|Secretary of Education]] [[William Bennett]], that the program became:&lt;blockquote&gt;a way of enhancing students' knowledge of their native language and culture. Bilingual education was no longer seen so much as a means to ensure that students learned English, or as a transitional method until students learned English. Rather, it became an emblem of cultural pride, a means of producing a positive self-image in the student.&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 164"&gt;Who Are We?, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Finally, the single most imposing challenge to America, in Huntington's view, is the problem of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican immigration]] and the resulting "Hispanization" of those regions of the United States adjacent to and acquired from Mexico. He fears that the result of Mexican immigration could be a "bifurcated" America. Huntington argues that Mexican immigration differs from previous waves of immigration in several fundamental ways, including:

*'''Contiguity:''' America is the only [[First World]] country in the world sharing a long, undefended border with a [[Third World]] country, making the crossing both easy and appealing to Mexicans.&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 222"&gt;Who Are We?, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Numbers:''' In the 1990s, Mexican immigration accounted for 25% of all legal immigration, much larger than the influx of [[Irish Americans|Irish]] or [[German Americans|German]] immigrants earlier in American history.&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 223"&gt;Who Are We?, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Illegality:''' Roughly 8–10 million [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] were in the United States by 2003, 58% of which were Mexican.&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 225"&gt;Who Are We?, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Regional concentration:''' "In 2000, nearly two thirds of Mexican immigrants lived in the West, and nearly half in California".&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 226"&gt;Who Are We?, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Persistence:''' It is estimated that nearly half a million Mexicans will immigrate to the United States each year until 2030, culminating in nearly a half century of high immigration from a single country.&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 228"&gt;Who Are We?, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Historical presence:''' "No other immigrant group in American history has asserted or has been able to assert a historical claim to American territory. Mexicans and Mexican-Americans can and do make that claim".&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 229"&gt;Who Are We?, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only does Mexican immigration differ from previous immigration in these ways, but Huntington argues that Mexicans lag other immigrants in their assimilation into American society for several reasons, including:

*'''Language:''' Different from other immigrants, [[Hispanic]] immigrants emphasize the need for their children to be fluent in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].
*'''Education:''' Mexicans were less likely to graduate high school and attend college than other immigrant groups.&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 234"&gt;Who Are We?, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Occupation and income:''' Mexican immigrants were far less likely to hold professional or managerial positions, and had low rates of self-employment and entrepreneurship. This parallels their educational attainment. Mexican immigrants were also more likely to live in poverty and to be on welfare than any other ethnic group, except [[Dominican Americans (Dominican Republic)|Dominicans]].&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 235"&gt;Who Are We?, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Citizenship:''' The rate of [[naturalization]] of Mexican immigrants was among the lowest of all immigrant groups. At least part of this may be attributable to the influence of illegal immigration.
*'''Intermarriage:''' Rates of Hispanic intermarriage are roughly equivalent to that of other immigrant groups.
*'''Identity:''' Mexican immigrants and their children generally refer to themselves as Mexican first and American second. However, approximately one quarter of Hispanics convert to Protestantism, a fact that Huntington attributes to assimilation of American culture, as many Hispanics come from a [[Catholicism|Catholic]] tradition.&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 241"&gt;Who Are We?, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

Huntington argues that these differences are the result of cultural differences between American Anglo Protestant culture and Hispanic "culture of Catholicism". Lionel Sosa, a [[Texas]] Mexican-American businessman, summarizes these differences as "mistrust of people outside the family; lack of initiative, self-reliance, and ambition; low priority for education; acceptance of poverty as a virtue necessary for entrance into heaven".&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 254"&gt;Who Are We?, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Huntington argues that this persistent pattern of a massive influx of immigrants from [[Latin America]], especially Mexico, has already resulted in changes in culture, business, language, and education in the [[Southwestern United States]]. If the trend continues, this could result in the consolidation of this part of the country into a distinct cultural bloc within the United States that threatens to bifurcate America.
	
Finally, Huntington lists other ways in which America's identity has weakened. These include: the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] left the United States without an enemy against which to define itself; the denationalization of business, professional, intellectual, and academic elites; and the influence of [[Diaspora|diasporas]]. By "denationalization", Huntington means that these Americans think of themselves mostly as members of an international community and not really as citizens of the United States.

==Renewing American identity==
After laying out the concerns for the weakening and subsequent dissolution of America, which could plausibly occur due to cultural bifurcation and/or a government formed of [[Davos Man|denationalized elites]] that increasingly ignore the will of the public, Huntington attempts to formulate a solution to these problems. He argues that adherence to the American Creed is by itself not enough to sustain an American identity. An example of a state that attempted to use ideology alone was the Soviet Union, which attempted to impose [[communism]] on different cultures and nationalities, and eventually collapsed. A similar fate could lie in store for the United States unless Americans "participate in American life, learn America's language [English], history, and customs, absorb America's Anglo-Protestant culture, and identify primarily with America rather than with their country of birth".&lt;ref name="Who Are We, p. 339"&gt;Who Are We?, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Huntington suggests that Americans turn to Protestantism, and recognize that what distinguishes America from other countries is that it is an extremely religious Western country, founded on the principles of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Protestant Reformation]].

== Reception ==

On the year of the book's release, [[Alan Wolfe]] of ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' wrote, "to claim that there exists a common '[[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant#WASP culture|Anglo-Protestant culture]]...' ignores the fact that Protestants have disagreed vehemently with each other over what that culture is." He furthermore argued that "Huntington fails to appreciate the degree to which immigrants shaped American culture even as they assimilated" and that the [[liberal elite]]s he criticizes "include disproportionately large numbers of the Anglo-Protestants whose culture Huntington wants to celebrate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Native Son: Samuel Huntington Defends the Homeland|issue=May/June 2004|website=Foreign Affairs|author=Alan Wolfe|accessdate=10 January 2018|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2004-05-01/native-son-samuel-huntington-defends-homeland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michiko Kakutani of the ''New York Times'' further criticized it as "recycling arguments made by a wide array of earlier thinkers... while glossing masses of research with decidedly subjective analysis" and as "riddled with gross [[generalization]]s... and equally questionable assertions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Books of the Times; An Identity Crisis for Norman Rockwell America|date=28 May 2004|website=The New York Times|author=Michiko Kakutani|accessdate=10 January 2018|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/28/books/books-of-the-times-an-identity-crisis-for-norman-rockwell-america.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 2013 ''Washington Post'' article by [[Dylan Matthews]] challenged Huntington's points, arguing that Latino immigrants have been adapting to English just as quickly as Asian and European immigrants have as of 2000, that proficiency in English and support for English as the official language of the United States among Latino Americans increased over generational status, and that Hispanic Americans are no less religious or hard-working than white Americans are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Hispanic immigrants are assimilating just as quickly as earlier groups|date=28 January 2013|website=The Washington Post|author=Dylan Matthews|accessdate=10 January 2018|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/01/28/hispanic-immigrants-are-assimilating-just-as-quickly-as-earlier-groups/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ''Washington Post'' book critic Carlos Lozada penned an editorial describing Huntington's works as "[anticipating] America's political and intellectual battles -- and [pointing] to the country we may become." He states that Huntington "captures the dissonance between working classes and elites, between nationalism and cosmopolitanism, that played out in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 campaign]]." He also comments that Huntington's expressed in ''Clash of Civilizations'' and ''Who Are We?'' contrast sharply with those he expressed in his 1981 work ''American Politics: The Promise of Disharmony'', wherein Huntington argues that Americans are primarily united by a [[Classical liberalism|classically liberal]] creed rather than "ethnic identity or religious faith." Lozada goes on to challenge criticism of Huntington's ideas as "single-minded," stating that "Huntington foresees an America roiled by [[self-doubt]], [[white nationalism]] and [[Islamophobia|enmity against Islam]]." However, he concedes that Huntington offers a "narrow view of [[American exceptionalism|American uniqueness]]," ultimately warning against [[isolationism]], "demonizing newcomers and demanding cultural fealty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Samuel Huntington, a prophet for the Trump era|date=18 July 2017|website=The Washington Post|author=Dylan Matthews|accessdate=10 January 2018|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2017/07/18/samuel-huntington-a-prophet-for-the-trump-era/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54033">This '''list of the works of [[William Crooke]]''' (1848–1923) represents much of his literary output in pursuit of his interests in [[ethnology]] and [[folklore]], for which he was far many years considered to be a leading authority.

In addition to the items listed below in respect of ''Folk-lore Record'' and its successor, ''Folk-lore'', the journal of the [[Folklore Society]], Crooke also contributed frequently to that journal in the form of letters and brief observations. He was editor of the journal from 1915 until his death.&lt;ref name=Rose1923p383/&gt;

In addition to these works, Crooke made many contributions to the ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics''.

He had been editing the ''Katha Sagara Kosa'', as translated by [[Charles Henry Tawney]], at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=Rose1923p383/&gt;

'''Xuan paper''' (''xuanzhi'' {{zh|t=[[wikt:宣紙|宣紙]]|s=[[wikt:宣纸|宣纸]]|p={{linktext|xuānzhǐ}}}}), or '''Shuen paper''' or '''rice paper''', is a kind of [[paper]] originating in ancient [[China]] used for writing and painting. Xuan paper is renowned for being soft and fine textured, suitable for conveying the artistic expression of both [[Chinese calligraphy]] and painting.

== Origin ==
Xuan paper was first mentioned in ancient Chinese books ''Notes of Past Famous Paintings'' and ''[[New Book of Tang]]''. It was originally produced in the [[Tang dynasty]] in [[Jing County, Anhui|Jing County]], which was under the jurisdiction of [[Xuancheng|Xuan Prefecture]] (Xuanzhou), hence the name Xuan paper. During the Tang dynasty, the paper was often a mixture of [[hemp]] (the first fiber used for paper in China) and mulberry fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Technology, treatment, and care of a chinese wood block print|author1=Fei Wen Tsai|author2=Dianne van der Reyden|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|p=4|url=https://www.si.edu/mci/downloads/RELACT/chinese_prints.pdf}} originally appeared as "Analysis of modern Chinese paper and treatment of a Chinese woodblock print" in ''The Paper Conservator'', 1997, pp. 48-62&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Song dynasty]], the paper producing industries in Huizhou and Chizhou were gradually transferred to Jing County.

== Classification ==
Due to different producing methods, Xuan paper can be classified into ''Shengxuan'', ''Shuxuan'', and ''Banshuxuan''. Shengxuan (literally "Raw Xuan"), which is not specially processed, excels in its ability to absorb water, causing the ink on it to blur. Shuxuan (literally "Ripe Xuan"), however, has [[Potassium alum]] worked into it during production, which results in a stiffer texture, a reduced ability to absorb water, and less resistance to shear stress (meaning that it can be torn much more easily). This feature makes Shuxuan more suitable for [[Gongbi]] rather than Xieyi. Banshuxuan (literally "Half-ripe Xuan") has intermediate absorbability, between Shengxuan and Shuxuan.

== Features ==
Xuan paper features great tensile strength, smooth surface, pure and clean texture and clean stroke, great resistance to crease, corrosion, moth and mold. The majority of ancient Chinese books and paintings by famous painters that survived until today are well preserved on Xuan paper. Xuan paper won the Golden Award at the Panama International Exposition in 1915. Xuan paper was used to make scrolls.

== Material and production ==
The material Xuan paper uses is closely related to the geography of Jing County. The bark of ''[[Pteroceltis tatarinowii]]'', a common species of [[elm]] in the area, was used as the main material to produce Xuan paper. [[Rice]], along with several other materials, was subsequently added to the recipe in the Song and Yuan Dynasties. [[Bamboo]] and [[mulberry]] also began to be used to produce xuan paper around that time.

The production of Xuan paper can be loosely described as an 18-step process, and a detailed account would involve over a hundred. Some paper makers have invented steps which have been kept secret from others. The process includes steaming and bleaching the bark of ''Pteroceltis tatarinowii'', as well as the addition of a variety of juices.

'''YoWorld''' (Formerly '''''Yoville''''') is a browser-based [[virtual world]] game which was released on May 8, 2008. It is currently developed by [[Big Viking Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bigvikinggames.com/yoworld/|title=YoWorld|work=Big Viking Games|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game operates on the [[freemium]] model, and is supported through [[Microtransaction|microtrasactions]], as well as a [[In-game advertising|voluntary in-game ad program]]. The game itself is free-to-play, however, players can purchase in-game currencies or enroll in special programs and offers to improve their game-play experience or help them progress faster, using real money. 

Users can create a [[Avatar (computing)|virtual avatar]], and enter the [[virtual world]]. Within YoWorld, players can earn [[Virtual currency|virtual coins and currencies]] (like ''YoCoins'' and ''YoCash'') in-game by completing various jobs and tasks in-game. They can also purchase more with real money. ''YoWorlders'' can then use these funds to purchase and decorate new homes, purchase more clothing and gear for their avatars, adopt pets, or even take advantage of the game's [[virtual economy]], and make investments by buying, selling, and trading items with other players. Other activities in-game include mini-games, hosting parties, socializing and chatting with other users, and role-play. The game is currently available on the social media platform, [[Facebook]], as a browser-based game. It can also be accessed through Facebook's Game Room platform.

The game was originally released and developed by Tall Tree Games in 2008. That same year, the game was purchased by gaming giant [[Zynga]], inspiring other later titles like [[FarmVille]] and [[CityVille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2008/07/21/daily45.html|title=https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2008/07/21/daily45.html|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/07/22/zynga-raises-29-million-b-round-led-by-kleiner-perkins-and-buys-virtual-world-facebook-app-yoville/|title=Zynga Raises $29 Million B Round (Led By Kleiner Perkins) and Buys Virtual-World Facebook App YoVille – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/709971/Farmville-Legal-Fight-Who-Owns-Ville.html|title=G4TV|website=www.g4tv.com|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tall Tree Games was the original name for the game's current company, Big Viking Games, who sought to acquire the game back from Zynga after its closure was announced on January 10, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.siliconbeat.com/2014/01/13/zynga-to-shut-down-yoville-game/|title=Zynga to shut down YoVille game|date=2014-01-13|work=SiliconBeat|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement of the game's closure led to months of organized virtual in-game protests, and boycott threats from passionate fans towards Zynga.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/game-thousands-yovillers-rally-doomed-virtual-town-n25001|title=Game On: Thousands of YoVillers Rally for Doomed Virtual Town|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout these months, negotiation took place between Zynga and Big Viking Games, which eventually concluded with the decision to allow the game to continue running with Big Viking Games as its new developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/01/28/why-big-viking-wants-to-save-yoville-from-zyngas-axe/#3961e5c730a0|title=Why Big Viking Wants To Save 'YoVille' From Zynga's Axe|last=Tassi|first=Paul|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/saveyoville-succeeds-zynga-sells-game-back-creators-relaunch-n89711|title=#SaveYoVille Succeeds: Zynga Sells Game Back to Creators for Relaunch|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition came with re-branding the game, from ''YoVille'' to ''YoWorld.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/24/yoville-renamed-yoworld-and-officially-acquired-from-zynga-by-big-viking-games/|title=YoVille Renamed YoWorld And Officially Acquired From Zynga By Big Viking Games – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/04/24/yoville-lives-zynga-agrees-to-let-developer-big-viking-games-take-over-operations/|title=YoVille lives: Zynga agrees to let developer Big Viking Games take over operations|date=2014-04-24|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is pretty much a [[Life simulation game|life-simulation]], and players can live it as they please.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.virtualworldsland.com/games/reviews/yoworld|title=YoWorld Review - Virtual Worlds Land!|website=www.virtualworldsland.com|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; To keep the game interesting, the developers regularly release new "''themes''" within the game. Themes are new furniture, clothing, pets, and housing lines that are released all in correlation with one another. Themes can be based on or inspired by a number of things, such as holidays, real-life locations, time periods and eras, stories and folklore, lifestyles, artistic movements, and genres of fiction. 

To make money, players can take on jobs, or perform daily tasks and collect bonuses, like opening free mystery chests they receive from friends. They can also participate in the game's virtual economy by buying, selling, and trading [[virtual goods]], such as furniture and clothing. Watching ads is also another way of making free YoCoins within the game.  

YoWorld has its own map filled with public locations, as well as various hangouts players can go to meet new people, such as, but not limited to, a vintage diner and a nightclub. YoWorlders can also make posts and participate in discussion on the YoWorld Forums, where they can give feedback for new themes, features, and assets they'd like to see in-game.
