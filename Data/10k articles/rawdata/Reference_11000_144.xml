The '''Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar Literature Museum Library''' ({{lang-tr|Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar Edebiyat Müze Kütüphanesi}}) is a literary museum and archive dedicated to [[Turkish literature]] and named after the Turkish novelist and essayist [[Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar]] (1901–1962). Located in [[Istanbul]], Turkey, the museum was established by the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism]] and opened on November 12, 2011.&lt;ref name="tz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="s1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hbr7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ktb"/&gt;

The museum is housed in the two-storey [[Procession Kiosk]] ({{lang-tr|Alay Köşkü}}), a 19th-century historic building on the outer walls of [[Gülhane Park]] that belongs to [[Topkapı Palace]].&lt;ref name="hbr7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ktb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt; It was used by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultans to accept salute of [[janissary]] soldiers parading as well as a pleasure locale.&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt; The building is situated across the [[Sublime Porte]].&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt; It was used from the 1910s on as the center of the Fine Arts Association.&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt; From 1928 to the end 1930s, it served as a meeting place of an association dedicated to Turkish language and literature.&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt;

On the ground floor, there are two rooms and an entrance hall.&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt; The first floor houses the former throne room, in addition to two halls and three rooms.&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt; The ground floor is designed as a cafeteria,&lt;ref name="hbr7"/&gt; called the "Writers' Café", where prize-winning literary works are exhibited.&lt;ref name="tz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="s1"/&gt; Special corners on the upper floor are dedicated to the life and works of around 50 renowned authors native to Istanbul, with [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]]s of some,&lt;ref name="s1"/&gt; including [[Nedîm]] (1681–1730), [[Yahya Kemal Beyatlı]] (1884–1958), [[Nâzım Hikmet Ran]] (1902–1963), [[Necip Fazıl Kısakürek]] (1904–1983), [[Aziz Nesin]] (1915–1995), [[Orhan Pamuk]] (born 1952), [[Ayşe Kulin]] (born 1941), [[Zülfü Livaneli]] (born 1946) and [[Doğan Hızlan]] (born 1937) in addition to Tanpınar.&lt;ref name="tz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt; It is also a place for discussions on various authors,&lt;ref name="z1"/&gt; poetry performances, literature award ceremonies, and writing workshops.&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ek"/&gt; The library of the museum accommodates over 8,000 books, including about 1,000 books on Istanbul as well as volumes of more than 100 periodicals on literature and other fields of the arts.&lt;ref name="tz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="s1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hbr7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt; The museum hosts also temporary art exhibitions.&lt;ref name="tk"/&gt; It is the fourth of its kind in Turkey after the literature museums in [[Ankara]], [[Adana]] and [[Diyarbakır]].&lt;ref name="tz1"/&gt;

The '''Chronicle of Ramon Muntaner''', written in Xirivella between 1325 and 1328, is the longest of the four great chronicles and narrates the facts from the birth of [[James I of Aragon]] (1207) to the coronation of [[Alfonso IV of Aragon]] (1328). His character of "mirror of princes" and "mirror of citizens" has been pointed out by all scholars.&lt;ref name="Soldevila2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ferran Soldevila|title=Les quatre grans croniques: Llibre dels feits del rei En Jaume|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=yoMi0efe7foC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ferran+soldevila+quatre+grans&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0tujcvZDWAhWKvRQKHbo8AEwQuwUIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ferran%20soldevila%20quatre%20grans&amp;f=false|year=2007|publisher=Institut d'Estudis Catalans|isbn=978-84-7283-901-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He explains things that happened really and that he saw and lived. Muntaner often uses "I was there", which underlines its role as witness, and the data it provides helps to know the time of James I. The Catalan writer and investigator, [[Ferran Soldevila]] has been one of the main interpreters of the work of this medieval chronicler and his praise is quite eloquent.&lt;ref name="raco"&gt;{{cite book|title =Les 4 grans cròniques | publisher = Raco.cat||year =2012 |url =http://www.raco.cat/index.php/LlenguaLiteratura/article/view/306354/396261| access-date = September 6, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Author ==
[[Ramon Muntaner]] was born in [[Peralada Castle|Peralada]] in 1265. He was the son of a remarkable family that hosted Jaume I the Conqueror (in 1274, Jaume I went to the [[Council of Lyon]] and sojourned in the [[Peralada Castle|Castle of Peralada]] with [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X the Wise of Castile]].This fact, which occurred when he was nine years old, was one of his most precious memories and he mentions this event with emotion in the ''Chronicle''. In the same way that in the European novelist tradition (for example, [[Chrétien de Troyes]] ), it is exposed to us, how the vision of a great hero in the eyes of a child is capable of changing the course of his life. Muntaner says that the vision of James I when he was a child led him to devote himself as a writer explaining everything he had seen..&lt;ref name="de)1842"&gt;{{cite book|author=Conde de Osona Moncada (Francisco de)|title=Expedicion de los Catalanes y Aragoneses contra Turcos y Griegos.

In 1285, [[Peralada]] was destroyed by the Almogavars during the Crusade against the [[Crown of Aragon]] and had to emigrate. When he was twenty, [[Ramon Muntaner]] took part in the conquest of Menorca ; Later, he participated in the fight against the French during the War of Sicily, in 1300 at the Siege of Messina, next to Roger de Flor and as the administrator of his company. In the summer of 1302, he began under the orders of this leader, the expedition to the East. In 1307, he left the company, and in 1311 he got married..&lt;ref name="Moncada2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francisco de Moncada|title=Expedición de catalanes y aragoneses al Oriente|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iuc4dubUDe0C|date=1 January 2014|publisher=Linkgua digital|isbn=978-84-9897-757-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1315, he had to travel between [[Sicily]] and [[Roussillon]], as he was in charge of a delicate mission: to transport from [[Catania]] to [[Perpignan]] an orphan baby, the future Jaume III of Mallorca, in order to deliver him to his grandparents. From that moment on, his memoirs were removed and matured for ten years, until he had a revealing "dream" that prompted him, in 1325, at the age of sixty, in Valencia, to start writing the ''Chronicle'', which he finished three years later. Muntaner died in [[Ibiza]] in 1336

== Work ==
[[File:Setorius and the Example of the Horses, after Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|220px|right|''Sertorius and the Example of the Horses'', after [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]. The drawing illustrates the example Sertorius gave to his followers that in the same way a horse's tail can be picked out hair by hair but not pulled out all at once, so smaller forces could defeat the Roman armies.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Müller in ''Hans Holbein the Younger: The Basel Years, 1515–1532,'' Christian Müller; Stephan Kemperdick; Maryan Ainsworth; ''et al'', Munich: Prestel, 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-7913-3580-3}}, {{nowrap|pp. 263–64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Muntaner had a personal relationship with all the kings of the House of Aragon, the House of Mallorca and the House of Sicily belonging to the lineage of the Casal de Barcelona that were contemporary to him. In doing his work, he mainly resorted to historiographic texts for the reigns of James I and Peter the Great, and, from Alfons el Franc, his almost exclusive source is his own experience.

The work was written to be read aloud. Whenever he addresses his "listeners", he usually calls them "lords". Muntaner managed to establish direct communication with his "listeners". For this, he uses joglaresque procedures (such as the question "What will I say?"), As well as using a live and colloquial language

The fundamental objective of the work is to glorify the kings of the House of Aragon. The monarchism of our chronicler is closely related to providentialism and nationalism. The blood, a common destiny and the language (the ''beautiful catalanesc of the world'' ) are the elements that make up the base of the Catalan and Aragonese community. It is impossible to find in the whole of medieval Europe anything that resembles the "national" maturity of the ''Chronicle'' 

His life and adherence to the dynasty and the Catalan language, to which he expressed an extraordinary devotion, represent the counterweight to the centripetal forces within the Catalan national community resulting from the organization of conquered lands in new kingdoms (Mallorca, Valencia, Sicily) and, sometimes, the implantation of a new dynastic branch (Mallorca, Sicily). The awareness of the danger of division and the value of the union also explained it in its chronicle, especially in the example of the rush plant, "mata de jonc" in Catalan (Similar to the [[Sertorius]] horse tail example).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Plutarch's Lives of Sertorius, Eumenes, Agesilaus, and Pompey.

With this work, Ramón Muntaner also became the first author in the Catalan language to capture the aspirations of a large part of the Catalan elite for an Iberian political reunification, as he commented on Ariza's interview between the monarchs of the [[Crown of Aragon]] and the [[Crown of Castile]], in which the latter proposed to Peter the Great an alliance between them, the king of Portugal and the king of Mallorca, Muntaner added: ".''.. And, assuredly, he spoke the truth; if these four Kings of Spain whom he named, who are of one flesh and blood, held together, little need they fear all the other powers of the world.''.." ''(."..si aquests quatre reys que ell nomenava d'Espanya, qui són una carn e una sang, se teguessen ensemps, poch duptare tot laltre poder del món.''").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/muntaner_goodenough.pdf#page=206 Muntaner's Chronicle-p.206, L.Goodenough-Hakluyt-London-1921]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margarit i Pau, Joan: ''Paralipomenon Hispaniae libri decem''. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lluisvives.com/servlet/SirveObras/jlv/91348064098793506388868/ima0197.htm Cervantes Virtual; f. LXXXIIIv.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contrast between the Chronicle of Muntaner and the Chronicle of Pachymeres ==
Regarding the Catalan Company of the East, Ramon Muntaner began to write his chronicle in 1325, that is, 17 years after the Byzantine Greek [[George Pachymeres]] wrote his work ''De Michaele et Andronico Palæologis''. While the work of Pachymeres offers the Greek vision of the facts, emphasizing the atrocities committed by the Company and Roger de Flor until 1308, the Chronicle of Ramon Muntaner is the only western source that relates the events experienced by the Catalan Company of The Orient. In some aspects, the work of [[Ramon Muntaner]] becomes, not only a glorification of Roger de Flor and the Company, but also a counter-narrative of the work of Pachymeres, relating some facts that the Greek does not mention, and eluding to explain facts that the Greek author does report in detail. Some of these facts would be:
* Massacre of the Genoese : Pachymeres affirms that the origin of the massacre began as a result of a debt that [[Roger de Flor]] had not settled with the Genoese, while Muntaner did not explain why the confrontations originated.
* Battle of Germe : despite being a minor battle, Muntaner does not comment anything.
* Executions summary of Germe: Pachymeres explains the barbarism of [[Roger de Flor]] in wanting to execute the Greek military who had surrendered the fortress to the Turks, accusing them of cowardice. Muntaner does not comment anything.
* Summary executions of Kula: Again, Pachymeres explains the barbarism of [[Roger de Flor]] in wanting to execute the Greek military who had rendered the fortress to the Turks, accusing them of cowardice. Muntaner does not comment anything.
* War contributions to Philadelphia: Pachymeres explains that, after releasing the city of Philadelphia, [[Roger de Flor]] imposed on the city the payment of illegal and abusive war contributions. Muntaner does not comment anything.
* War contributions to Ephesus: Pachymeres explains that, after [[Bernat de Rocafort]] met with [[Roger de Flor|Roger de Flo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r in Ephesus, he committed all kinds of atrocities to raise the payment of more war contributions. Muntaner does not comment anything.
* The Siege of Magnesia : Pachymeres explains that the governor of Magnesia executed the almogavar garrison that was protecting the treasure of the Company and seized it, and then withstood the siege to which the Company underwent the city. Muntaner does not comment anything.
* Figures: it is unknown in what source Muntaner was based when citing the number of the armies, the number of killed, wounded and captured people, which are always favorable to [[Roger de Flor]] and the [[Catalan Company|Catalan East Company]], which in fact is a truism for they stayed there from 1303 till 1390 being the Turkish uncapable to defeat them.

== Codex and editions ==
Muntaner's work had great repercussions and diffusion during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and was used, for example, in various passages of ''[[Tirant lo Blanch|Tirant lo Blanc]]'' by [[Joanot Martorell]]. It was edited for the first time in the sixteenth century, coinciding with a time of great revision of historiography; This first edition was commissioned and paid by the jurors of the city of Valencia. New printed editions took place during the 19th century, during the period of romantic exaltation of the European medieval past, even a translation into English made by the Hakluyt Society in 1920-21&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/muntaner_goodenough.pdf#page=435 Muntaner's Chronicle-p.435, L.Goodenough-Hakluyt-London-1921]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Some exonyms of the chronicle ==

An '''application launcher''' is a [[computer program]] that helps a [[User (computing)|user]] to locate and start other computer programs.  An application launcher provides shortcuts to computer programs, and stores the shortcuts in one place so they are easier to find.

In the '''comparison of desktop application launchers''' that follows, each section is devoted to a different [[desktop environment]].

'''''Cooper NO en Andere v Die Meester en 'n Ander''''',&lt;ref&gt;1992 (3) SA 60 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; an important case in [[South Africa]]n [[South African property law|property]] [[South African law|law]], was heard in the Appellate Division on 7 November 1991, with judgment handed down on 5 March 1992.

== Judgment ==
The [[Insolvency Act]]&lt;ref&gt;Act 24 of 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; contains an exhaustive list of priorities of statutory preferences on insolvency.&lt;ref&gt;ss 96-102.&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that a special notarial bond over specified [[movable property]], when that property has remained in the possession of the mortgagor until the sequestration of his estate, is not included in this list and accordingly does not confer a statutory preference in favour of the mortgagee. It follows, held the court, that the mortgagee has no preference above other concurrent creditors in respect of the free residue.

The decision in the [[Orange Free State]] Provincial Division, in ''Cooper NO en Andere v Die Meester en 'n Ander'',&lt;ref&gt;1991 (3) SA 158.&lt;/ref&gt; was thus reversed.

The '''Crusade of Romanianism''' ({{lang-ro|Cruciada Românismului}}, also known as ''Vulturii Albi'', "White Eagles", or ''Steliștii'', "Stelists") was an eclectic [[far-right]] movement in [[Romania]], founded in 1934 by [[Mihai Stelescu]]. It originated as a dissident faction of the [[Iron Guard]], Romania's main [[Fascism|fascist]] movement, and was virulently critical of Guard leader [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]]. Stelescu reinterpreted nationalist ideology through the lens of [[anticapitalism]] and "humane" [[antisemitism]], appropriating some ideas from [[communism]] and [[Italian fascism]]. The Crusade was famously associated with [[Panait Istrati]], world-renowned novelist and dissident communist, who added into the mix of "Romanianism" some elements of [[libertarian socialism]].

The Stelists oscillated between maverick independence and electoral alliances with more prestigious nationalist parties. The Crusade was a minor party, whose decision of publicly settling scores with the Iron Guard proved fatal. In the summer of 1936, Stelescu was murdered by an [[Iron Guard death squads|Iron Guard death squad]], and his party only survived for one more year. Its caretakers during that final period were journalist [[Alexandru Talex]] and General [[Nicolae Rădescu]].

==History==

===Beginnings===
[[File:Stelescu &amp; Codreanu, Casa Verde, 1933.JPG|thumb|260px|Iron Guard rally, 1933. Codreanu is front row, right, with Stelescu by his side]]
Originally named "The White Eagles",&lt;ref&gt;Gheran, p.439&lt;/ref&gt; the Crusade emerged in early 1935, as a splinter group from the Iron Guard. Stelescu's break with Codreanu was sudden and public. In 1932, Stelescu was a prominent Guard politico, tasked with political campaigning in [[Bucharest]] and the youngest [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]] member.&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.159, 228, 241&lt;/ref&gt; As documented by visitors [[Jean Tharaud|Jean]] and [[Jérôme Tharaud]], Stelescu eclipsed his political boss in matters of oratory and political competence.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p.253; Veiga, p.241&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of this, Codreanu began handing him risky assignments, implicating him in the assassination of [[Prime Minister of Romania|Premier]] [[Ion G. Duca]] (for which Stelescu served a term in prison).&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p.253, 446&lt;/ref&gt; It is also likely that Stelescu was infuriated by Codreanu's refusal to tackle the political establishment head on: in 1934, the Guard was keeping a low profile, content with mildly criticizing the authoritarian [[King of Romania]], [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.306-307; Veiga, p.228-230, 241&lt;/ref&gt;

When, in September 1934, Stelescu went public with his first denunciations of Codrenist tactics, he was promptly excluded from the Guard. The decision had a vague disclaimer: Stelescu could be welcomed back into the Guard on condition that he perform an exceptional act of self-sacrifice.&lt;ref name="zo(95)306"&gt;Ornea (1995), p.306&lt;/ref&gt; According to later Codrenist mythology, Stelescu had in fact been exposed as the would-be assassin of Codreanu.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.122; Heinen, p.253, 277; Veiga, p.241&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Stelescu alleged that, by hinting at reconciliation, Codreanu had discreetly urged him to poison another one of the Iron Guard's adversaries: [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Minister]] [[Nicolae Titulescu]].&lt;ref&gt;"Iron Guard Accused of Plotting Titulescu's Death", in the [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] ''News'', Nr. 213/1937&lt;/ref&gt;

Stelescu left together with some other high-ranking activists of Codreanu's movement, who helped him establish the "White Eagles" party, and possibly convinced all of the Guard's youth sections in Bucharest to join them.&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.229, 241&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Franklin L. Ford sees the schism as important, arguing that Stelescu effectively took control of the "Cross Brotherhood" network, which he had helped recruit for the Guard in the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, p.268&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the Guard's supposed [[elitism]], Stelescu hoped to rely on support from more populist Guardsmen, including [[Ion Moța]] and [[Gheorghe Clime]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p.253. See also Clark, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, the splinter group soon found support among figures of the Carol regime, who financed it as a way of drawing away support from the Guard.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.122&lt;/ref&gt;

Talex, who was politically independent, had been university colleagues with Stelescu. He was moved by Stelescu's marginalization, but, as he recalled in a later interview, personally disliked him.&lt;ref name="mptalex"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mugur Popovici, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/panait_istrati_m-a_ajutat_sa_raman_om_intr-o_lume_de_lupi " 'Panait Istrati m-a ajutat să rămân om într-o lume de lupi' "], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 48/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Talex and Stelescu were allegedly supplied with funds by Prince [[Constantin Karadja]],&lt;ref name="zo(95)306"/&gt; who also contributed to the paper.&lt;ref name="zoistrscriit"/&gt; Another important figure was [[Gheorghe Beza]], an [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] dissident of the Iron Guard, famous for his earlier involvement in political conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p.183-184, 187, 278, 477&lt;/ref&gt; Other men involved with Stelescu's newspaper, and probably his movement, were journalists Sergiu Lecca, Dem.

More famously, ''Cruciada Românismului'' hosted articles by [[Panait Istrati]]. He was a literary celebrity and long-time [[Socialism|socialist]], whose public denunciation of the [[Soviet Union]] had sparked an international controversy. It is still unclear whether Istrati was ever formally affiliated with the Crusade as a political party. Some authors suggest as much.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.122; Ionesco, p.184; Veiga, p.229&lt;/ref&gt; In April Istrati died from [[tuberculosis]] in Bucharest. He had been unable to support himself during his last months, and relied on government handouts—an appeasement that was much ridiculed from the [[far left]].&lt;ref name="mptalex"/&gt; An independent [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] newspaper, ''Proletarul'', claimed that the Stelists had supervised Istrati's funeral ceremony, driving away his leftist friends.&lt;ref name="stt(04)53"&gt;Tănase (2004), p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under Stelescu===
[[File:Înmormântarea lui Panait Istrati, apr 1935.jpg|thumb|400px|Stelescu and other Crusade members at [[Panait Istrati]]'s funeral, April 1935]]
The Stelists were intensely courted by other far-right organizations, with which the Guard was competing for the nationalist vote. The Crusade was especially close to the [[National-Christian Defense League]] (LANC), from which the Guard had split almost a decade before, and envisaged the creation of a "united front" against democracy and "the radical left".&lt;ref&gt;"Demisia Doctorului Trifu", in ''Cruciada Românismului'', November 22, 1934, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1935, a Crusade delegation attended a LANC's national congress. The state monitored such agreements, which also involved the [[Romanian Front]], and reported that the Crusade was in the process of merging with the LANC.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Radu Florian Bruja, [http://www.history-cluj.ro/Istorie/anuare/AnuarBaritHistorica2010/06.pdf "Din istoria partidului național creștin în Bucovina (1935-1937)"], in the [[Romanian Academy]] (George Bariț Institute of History) ''Historica Yearbook'' 2010, p.83&lt;/ref&gt;

The LANC merger never took place. In September 1935, the Crusade of Romanianism sealed a pact with the right-wing [[National Liberal Party-Brătianu|"Georgist" Liberals]] and [[Grigore Forțu]]'s extremist [[Citizen Bloc|Citizens' Bloc of National Salvation]].&lt;ref name="ghifomul8"&gt;Gheorghe I. Florescu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/FLORESCUdec9.html "Alexandru Averescu, omul politic (VIII)"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This three-pronged alliance aimed at involvement in national politics. The "Georgists" had also formed a cartel with the [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]] (PP), which had previously been one of the three most powerful parties in Romania. The "Georgist"-Populist alliance, or "Constitutional Front", came to include both the Stelists and the Citizen's Bloc.&lt;ref name="ghifomul8"/&gt;

PP leader [[Alexandru Averescu]] was working to gather as much support as needed for prompting Carol to hand him power. His plan backfired: on one hand, the Stelists did not necessarily endorse the idea of a new Averescu government; on the other, the PP moderates protested against Averescu's cohabitation with fascist groups.&lt;ref name="ghifomul8"/&gt; By early 1936, the Constitutional Front still existed, but the PP had effectively withdrawn from it.&lt;ref name="ghifomul8"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the Crusade was preparing to settle scores with the Iron Guard. Its newspapers published detailed reports about the contacts between Codreanu and King Carol, noting that the Guard enjoyed free publicity "in the official and semiofficial press", and even that government money was being spent on manufacturing Guardist insignia.&lt;ref&gt;Eliza Campus, "Despre politica externă antinațională a guvernelor burghezo-moșierești din România, în timpul politicii imperialiste de așa-zisă 'neintervenție' ", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Nr. 3/1952, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; More disturbingly for Codreanu, Stelescu was publishing information regarding secret contacts between the Guard and the royal mistress, [[Elena Lupescu]],&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p.298-299, 306-307&lt;/ref&gt; as well as statements implicating Codreanu in the Duca assassination&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p.277&lt;/ref&gt; and questioning his Romanian ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu &amp; Savu, p.310; Clark, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stelescu and Beza visited with [[Armand Călinescu]], the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Minister of Internal Affairs]], providing him with a full record of the Guard's policy on assassinations.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu &amp; Savu, p.292-293&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stelescu's assassination and aftermath===
{{Fascism in Romania}}
Stelescu himself already expected to be assassinated by the Codrenists, and repeatedly taunted his adversaries, instructing them to shoot him, but "not in the back".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p.307&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1936, while recovering at the [[Brâncovenesc Hospital]], where he had undergone an [[appendectomy]], Stelescu fell victim to the Guard's revenge. A [[Iron Guard death squads|''Decemviri'' death squad]], comprising ten Theology students,&lt;ref name="fv229"&gt;Veiga, p.229&lt;/ref&gt; had formally received Codreanu's blessing at the Iron Guard Congress in [[Târgu Mureș]] that April.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu &amp; Savu, p.310; Clark, p.121, 123, 134; Gheorghe &amp; Șerbu, p.268; Heinen, p.259-260, 278, 281-284, 290, 446; Ornea (1995), p.204, 307&lt;/ref&gt; Seizing its opportunity, it stormed into the hospital building and shot Stelescu to death. This murder left an enduring mark on public memory because of its ritualistic nature: Stelescu's body was not just riddled with bullets, but also bludgeoned or hacked to pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu &amp; Savu, p.310; Clark, p.123; Gheran, p.440; Heinen, p.260; Ornea (1995), p.308; Veiga, p.229&lt;/ref&gt;

The orphaned movement still counted among its members some relevant figures in Romanian politics. [[Nicolae Rădescu]], a [[Romanian Land Forces]] general, was an affiliate, and, according to some sources, became the Crusade's leader upon Stelescu's murder.&lt;ref&gt;V. Liveanu, "Particularități ale strategiei politice a Partidului Comunist Român în revoluția populară. Revendicările imediate și obiectivul final", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Nr. 3/1971, p.584&lt;/ref&gt; He was in any case the decision-maker, and probably contributed to the movement's financing.&lt;ref name="amit94"&gt;Mitchievici, p.94&lt;/ref&gt; Previously registered with Averescu's PP, Rădescu was a stated enemy of the political establishment. In 1933, upon presenting his resignation from the army, he had accused "profiteering politicians" and the king's "[[camarilla]]" of commercializing military life.&lt;ref name="cgh&amp;mș303"&gt;Gheorghe &amp; Șerbu, p.303&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Crusade members were harmed by Codrenist attacks, and, within the Iron Guard, "Stelism" became a crime punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.123; Heinen, p.260, 278, 283-284, 291, 483&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Codreanu feared retaliation, and surrounded himself with body guards.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.123&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cruciada Românismului'' newspaper was in print until 1937,&lt;ref name="isd&amp;al316"/&gt; by which time some of its members had embraced other causes. Moving on from the Crusade, Sergiu Lecca was involved in arranging contacts between the mainstream [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ) and communist cells.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stelian Tănase]], [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/pdf/Sfera_136.pdf "N.D. Cocea, un boier amoral/N.D.

In March 1937, the [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]] government clamped down on all paramilitary movements, banning political uniforms, including the Guard's green shirts and the Crusade's [[Carmine (color)|carmine]] shirts.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.184-185&lt;/ref&gt; The group dissolved itself, but Rădescu remained politically active into World War II, and was listed as one of King Carol's more potent enemies.&lt;ref name="cgh&amp;mș303"/&gt; He survived the "[[National Legionary State|National Legionary]]" episode of Iron Guard rule, when he was reportedly marginalized as a "[[Freemasonry in Romania|Freemason]]".&lt;ref name="ndreplica"/&gt; According to one testimony, the general was never forgiven by the Guard for having supported Stelescu. During the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|putsch of January 1941]], Iron Guard assassin squads were on the lookout for Rădescu, who went into hiding.&lt;ref name="aș6martie"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alexandru Șerbănescu, [http://revista.memoria.ro/?location=view_article&amp;id=730 "Nicolae Rădescu 6 martie 1945"], in ''Memoria. Revista Gândirii Arestate'', Nr. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Some former Crusade members were already working at undermining Romania's involvement with the [[Axis Powers]]. From 1940, Beza took to the underground, redesigning the Peasant Guards as a "Free Romanian Movement"; tried for sedition, he was forced into exile.&lt;ref name="laibeza"/&gt; When, under the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime, Romanian troops occupied [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]], Rădescu issued a formal protest and spent a full year in the concentration camp.&lt;ref name="cgh&amp;mș303"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aș6martie"/&gt; From his diplomatic post, Prince Karadja extended protection to Jews fleeing the [[Holocaust]], coming into conflict with the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]].&lt;ref&gt;Trașcă &amp; Obiziuc, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Sergiu Lecca, who was the brother of Antonescu aide [[Radu Lecca]], took part in informal negotiations between Romania and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Amedeo Lăzărescu]], Andrei Goldner, "Opțiuni în politica externă", in Ion Solacolu (ed.), ''Tragedia României: 1939-1947.

===Final echoes===
Although still an [[Anticommunism|anticommunist]], Rădescu was brought to high office by the [[Soviet occupation of Romania]], and, from December 1944, served as [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]]. He refused to sanction Soviet abuse of power and clashed with the [[Romanian Communist Party]], while pursuing war against [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="ndreplica"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Neagu Djuvara]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Replica.-Din-nou-despre-exilul-romanesc*articleID_5908-articles_details.html "Replică. Din nou despre exilul românesc"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 140, October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aș6martie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe &amp; Șerbu, p.303-304&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Rădescu was also at war with the Iron Guard puppet government that was set up behind enemy lines, but it is still debated whether or not he actually protected those Guardsmen who did not defect to the Germans.&lt;ref name="ndreplica"/&gt;

The toppling of Rădescu's cabinet in February 1945 was a new step toward the [[communization]] of Romania.&lt;ref name="aș6martie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe &amp; Șerbu, p.304-305&lt;/ref&gt; Indicted as a crypto-fascist by the communist authorities, he escaped to [[New York City]], where he helped form the [[Romanian National Committee]].&lt;ref name="aș6martie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe &amp; Șerbu, p.305, 307&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving membership of the Crusade of Romanianism was also hunted down. According to aviator Ion Coșoveanu, who was for long a political prisoner of the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist republic]], Stelists were a distinct faction among the [[Romanian anti-communist resistance movement|anticommunist underground]]. Coșoveanu (quoted by writer Niculae Gheran) recalled that, once in prison, Crusade members used to bicker with Iron Guard rivals. Coșoveanu also notes that the Stelist faction accepted into its ranks the poet [[Radu Gyr]], until discovering that he was informing on them for the Guardists.&lt;ref&gt;Gheran, p.439-440&lt;/ref&gt;

Talex himself was not touched by communist persecutions and was perceived by the authorities as a fellow traveler.&lt;ref name="amit94"/&gt; When Istrati was posthumously [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] in the 1970s, Talex worked on publishing his manuscripts and his correspondence.&lt;ref name="zoistrscriit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mptalex"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.88-89, 94&lt;/ref&gt; As argued by cultural historian [[Zigu Ornea]], Talex's work in this field makes a point of obfuscating Istrati's contribution to the Crusade, as well as Talex's own.&lt;ref name="zoistrscriit"/&gt; This contrasted with the treatment of other former Crusade people: Dem. Bassarabeanu's poetry was stricken from public memory by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]], due to the author's fascist beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Andrei Moldovan, [http://www.revistavatra.ro/pdf/vatra_1-2011.pdf "Din corespondența lui Liviu Rebreanu"], in ''[[Vatra (Romanian magazine)|Vatra]]'', Nr. 11/2011, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; Another poet, [[Mihu Dragomir]], albeit formally aligned with communist ideology, was investigated for a supposed teenage involvement with the Crusade.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Anii-50-si-Tinarul-scriitor*articleID_13865-articles_details.html "Anii '50 și ''Tînărul Scriitor''"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 285, August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==

==="Confusing the extremes"===
Political historian [[Stanley G. Payne]] describes the Crusade as distinct among the Romanian fascist groups: "a tiny organization which sought to target workers and to inspire socioeconomic transformation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne]], ''A History of Fascism 1914-45'', [[Routledge]], London, 1995, p.284.  {{ISBN|978-0-299-14874-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the party, there was always a degree of assimilation between fascist trappings and [[far-left]] causes, indicative of Stelescu's indecision. In his first-ever editorial column, Stelescu derided all [[political uniform]]s, and implicitly all political extremes, stating: "one can believe in something without donning a colored shirt, just as one can wear a colored shirt without believing in anything." He demanded a "united front" of "fearless warriors", entirely cut off from all preexisting ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai Stelescu, "Prefață", in ''Cruciada Românismului'', November 22, 1934, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Stelescu had personally selected green-colored shirts as the Iron Guard uniform, before his own movement settled on carmine.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.184, 185&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1935 [[Eugène Ionesco]], the left-leaning literary columnist, noted that Stelescu's newspaper made a habit of "confusing the extremes". Ionesco was referring to ''Cruciada Românismului''{{'}}s appreciation for the socialist poetry of [[Liviu Bratoloveanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ionesco, p.183-184&lt;/ref&gt; The appropriation of leftist ideas was especially apparent after the Crusade's involvement in the international Istrati scandal. When he first publicized his pact with Stelescu, Istrati specified an "absolute requirement that the Crusade keep itself equally distant from fascism, communism and the [[antisemitism]] of hooligans."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Teodor Vârgolici, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/publicistica_lui_panait_istrati "Publicistica lui Panait Istrati"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 14/2007&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his letters, where he paraphrases the Stelist program, Istrati reaffirms this principle, while also noting: "Ours is a national movement for economic change, for civic education and for social combat. We are against capitalism, oppression and violence."&lt;ref name="mm&amp;alt292"&gt;Mermoz &amp; Talex, p.292&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was entirely against the [[parliamentary system]], but harbored two distinct currents when it came to supplanting it. Stelescu himself wrote that "democracy sickens us", since it had resulted in inept governance "by a mass of nitwits".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p.59-60&lt;/ref&gt; The movement viewed liberalism and [[Philosophy of human rights|human rights]] with suspicion rather than hostility, since they left the door open for "capitalism and politicking".&lt;ref&gt;Const. Barcaroiu, "Incertitudinea muncii", in ''Cruciada Românismului'', November 22, 1934, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Istrati had dissenting views. In its Christmas 1934 issue, ''Cruciada Românismului'' published his "Letter to... the Right", which called democracy "putrid" but described dictatorship as an unsound regime: "Dictatorship, of whatever kind, signals that the social organism has grown old. It is the system that will suppress in its adversary all his fighting means, to take them over for its own use, like an old man who ties up a robust youth and then proceeds to beat him up at his own convenience."&lt;ref&gt;"Revista revistelor. ''Cruciada Românismului''", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 2/1935, p.476-477&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond its anticapitalism, the Crusade had as its main characteristic a strong connection with [[Italian fascism]], as opposed to [[Nazism]]. Historian Francisco Veiga describes this as being a necessary repositioning against "Codreanu's [[Germanophilia]]"—when Nazi Germany and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] where still competing with each other in [[Southeastern Europe]].&lt;ref name="fv229"/&gt; Other historians also stress the Crusade's anti-Nazism. F. L. Ford also writes that Stelescu's "dramatic forecasts" are notable protests against the Guard's Nazification.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, p.268-269&lt;/ref&gt; Armin Heinen paraphrases Stelescu's message: "he feared [Germany] would impose upon Romania the status of a colony."&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p.253&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to Heinen, Codreanu's celebration of Nazism as an international phenomenon had turned Stelescu's attention toward the [[Benito Mussolini]] alternative.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p.300&lt;/ref&gt;

===Istrati's "spiritual movement"===
As Talex recalls, Istrati was bothered by Stelescu's homages to Mussolini, and, on one occasion, threatened to withdraw from the common enterprise.&lt;ref name="mptalex"/&gt; His own political preferences were veering toward [[libertarian socialism]] and [[anarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mermoz &amp; Talex, p.282, 283, 299-300; Mitchievici, p.82-83, 88-89; Roux, p.95-96, 101-104&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by [[Gandhism]], the "Letter to... the Right" advised against all forms of political violence.&lt;ref name="lbistratiind"&gt;{{ro icon}} Liviu Bordaş, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ "Istrati, Rolland și reprezentanții 'Renașterii indiene' "], in ''[[Idei în Dialog]]'', Nr. 8/2005&lt;/ref&gt; Istrati saw the Crusade as "rather a spiritual movement". According to Ornea, this was a naive assessment, and evidenced the degree to which Istrati was being "manipulated" by Talex.&lt;ref name="zoistrscriit"/&gt;

For Istrati's adversaries on the left, the Crusade involvement was proof that Istrati was a covert fascist. The allegations were publicized by two of Istrati's former colleagues in international communism, [[Henri Barbusse]] and [[Francis Jourdain]].&lt;ref&gt;Mermoz &amp; Talex, p.284-285, 289, 291, 301-302, 305; Roux, p.103; Tănase (2004), p.56&lt;/ref&gt; According to such sources, Istrati's "mercenary literature" and his contributions to a "fascist newspaper" earned him some 50,000[[French franc|₣]], paid for by [[Petrochemical industry in Romania|big oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [[Cayetano Córdova Iturburu]], "Panait Istrati", in ''Nueva Revista. Política, Arte, Economía'', Nº 4/1935, p.3 (online copy at the [[Internet Archive]] [https://archive.org/details/fedorganzf006a Fedor Ganz Collection])&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Trotskyist commentators were more lenient, writing off Istrati's inconsistencies as a sign of his perennial nervous instability.&lt;ref name="stt(04)53"/&gt;

Istrati made a point of responding in Stelescu's paper, under the headline "The Objectivity of the 'Independent' Communist Press" (March 21, 1935).&lt;ref&gt;Mermoz &amp; Talex, p.289&lt;/ref&gt; He was publicly defended by his friend, the anti-Soviet leftist [[Victor Serge]], who described Istrati's last combat in verse:

&lt;poem&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;

|}

However, Istrati's connection with the Crusade was not his only contact with right-wing radicalism: he had also promised to have his political testament printed in ''[[Gringoire (newspaper)|Gringoire]]'', a newspaper of the [[History of far-right movements in France|French far-right]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.86, 94&lt;/ref&gt; Against Talex's disclaimers, several later exegetes have reanimated the debate about Istrati's possible fascist leanings. Historian Jean-Michel Palmier includes Istrati's name on a list of "intellectuals [who] saw for a moment in fascism the possibility of arousing a crisis-struck Europe from its lethargy." He is in the company of [[Knut Hamsun]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Wyndham Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Palmier, ''Weimar in Exile: The Antifascist Emigration in Europe and America'', [[Verso Books]], London &amp; New York City, 2006, p.49-50.  {{ISBN|1-84467-068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philologist Tudorel Urian asks: "Who really is Istrati: the frantic socialist he was before his visit to the USSR [...] or the nationalist of his very last months, the emblem of a Guardist periodical? There is something that those who judge him rarely take into account: in the periods when he flirted with socialism [...] and Guardism, both movements where in their romantic, idealistic stages. Once he came face to face with the brutal realities of the Soviet regime, Istrati broke with socialism and perhaps his famous motto, ''je ne marche pas'' ['no, I won't bite'] would have come into play in relation with the Guardists, should he have lived to see their earliest crimes."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Tudorel Urian, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/cine_a_fost_panait_istrati "Cine a fost Panait Istrati?"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 10/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

According to literary historian [[Angelo Mitchievici]], "Interestingly, [the Crusade] had stated its dissidence and a distinct position within the Iron Guard movement. Perhaps it was the group's marginal, dissident status that appealed to Istrati. [...] Even if, in this very context, Panait Istrati endures as a freelancer, he could not have evaded the abusive assimilation into a direction that did not truly reflect his affinities."&lt;ref name="amit94"/&gt;

===On antisemitism and Christianity===
The Istrati scandal touches another controversial aspect of Stelist policies: their Iron Guard-inherited antisemitism. Stelescu sent the message in November 1934, when he criticized [[Minorities of Romania|ethnic minorities]] for monopolizing the job market: "Factory positions for Romanian workers, our own kind first and if anything is left we would gladly share it with the foreigner, if he is indeed in need of."&lt;ref&gt;Mihai Stelescu, "Șomajul", in ''Cruciada Românismului'', November 22, 1934, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; According to Veiga, Istrati "toned down the antisemitism of Stelescu and his followers, but the [Stelist] Movement continued to be a far-right one."&lt;ref name="fv229"/&gt; Also, "the disillusionment he felt toward Soviet communism did not manage to make Istrati into a fascist; quite the contrary, he was the one to influence Stelescu, making him renounce, for instance, his antisemitism."&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.241&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Crusade men, Prince Karadja witnessed first-hand the application of antisemitic terror in 1930s Germany, and was already taking measures to protect the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish Romanian]] expatriates.&lt;ref&gt;Traşcă &amp; Obiziuc, p.110-113&lt;/ref&gt;

In his papers of 1935, Istrati presents himself exclusively as an enemy of "the Jewish bourgeoisie", a class he describes as "corrupt, pseudo-humanitarian, pseudo-democratic" and accuses of stirring up scandal.&lt;ref name="mm&amp;alt292"/&gt; Istrati's articles in ''Cruciada Românismului'' are more adamantly [[philosemitic]]. One of them, "A Letter to Love", led to a series of articles on the subject, from Stelescu and other Crusade people.&lt;ref name="zoistrscriit"/&gt; In his own articles, Talex answered for the Stelist movement: "Panait Istrati, do you know what it is we need? A fist... The Crusade of Romanianism will attempt to become that fist... Our antisemitism? Just the same as yours: a humane one. But it is also combative, for as long as the Judaic element shall attempt to set up a state within our own state, sabotaging us with any opportunity it gets".&lt;ref name="zoistrscriit"/&gt; Stelescu's newspaper was noted for its obstinate claim that Jews were a rootless, disloyal race.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Zalis]], "Despre Mihail Sebastian, cu dragoste și cu strângere de inimă", in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 54-55/1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monumentul lui Eminescu aşa cum şi-l imaginează d. Tonitza.JPG|thumb|250px|A satirical take on "the Romanian eagle" as "the guiding principle of Romanianism". 1929 cartoon by [[Nicolae Tonitza]]]]
The Crusade's agenda was debated among Jewish Romanian intellectuals. Fellow writer [[Mihail Sebastian]] described Istrati as politically "illiterate" and "addled".&lt;ref&gt;Tănase (2004), p.53-55&lt;/ref&gt; In his words, "Mr. Istrati fights nowadays for the Crusade of Romanianism, searching for the formula of reasonable antisemitism (neither here nor there), for the way into a more gentle chauvinism, for a nice agreement between his anarchic vocation and a methodical process of bashing heads in."&lt;ref&gt;Tănase (2004), p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Other Jewish literary figures, including [[Josué Jéhouda]], issued statements in support of Istrati's stance.&lt;ref&gt;Mermoz &amp; Talex, p.292-294&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crusade may have contextualized its antisemitic reflexes within a pro-Christian bias. The [[American Jewish Committee]] papers describe the Crusade as "a Fascist group which did not have anti-Jewish tendencies", quoting Stelescu's statement "that he was not a Jew-baiter and that, although his party was nationalist, it was inspired by genuine Christian principles."&lt;ref&gt;Harry Scheiderman, ''[http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1937_1938_4_YearReview.pdf Review of the Year 5697]'', p.440, at the [http://www.ajcarchives.org/main.php American Jewish Committee Archives]; retrieved February 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The movement resented the secularization of public affairs, and expressed admiration for [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodoxy]]: "And if some church servants have indeed trespassed, faith itself is not to blame. The belief in God and The Cross is a banner and support for our combat, and the token of our coming victory."&lt;ref name="amfostatenți"&gt;"Am fost atenți...", in ''Cruciada Românismului'', November 22, 1934, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to at least one account, the ailing Istrati was in the process of becoming a militant [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel de Galzain, ''Une Âme du feu: Monseigneur Vladimir Ghika'', Éditions Beauchesne, Paris, 1961, p.83-84&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crusade believed that its mission included protecting Christian interests against the consequences of modernity. It was critical of [[feminism]], noting that Christianity itself had liberated women, had given them status and purpose. However, it also asserted that woman was "the guardian angel, always in the shadow of man." Feminism, meanwhile, was "equality in vice."&lt;ref&gt;Icadé, "Cronica femenină. Femeia", in ''Cruciada Românismului'', November 22, 1934, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; The Stelists also accused the Soviet Union and its Romanian sympathizers (for instance the staff of ''[[Cuvântul Liber (1933)|Cuvântul Liber]]'' newspaper) of mounting an international campaign against Christianity.&lt;ref name="amfostatenți"/&gt;

===Defining "Romanianism"===
When Stelescu founded his "White Eagles", the right-wing [[Nativism (politics)|nativists]], the [[Centrism|centrists]] and the advocates of [[left-wing nationalism]] in Romania had been disputing over the concept of "Romanianism" for over a decade. The idea of a homegrown ideological current of that name was swiftly embraced by intellectual sympathizers of the Iron Guard, among them [[Nae Ionescu]], [[Nichifor Crainic]], [[Alexandru Randa]], [[Traian Brăileanu]] and [[Mihail Manoilescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p.87-95, 98-102, 108, 110, 124-126, 374&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative Romanianism, liberal and skeptical toward nationalist rhetoric, was being promoted by the philosophers [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]] and [[Mircea Eliade]], who demanded the continuous [[Westernization]] of Romanian society.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p.119-129, 134-137&lt;/ref&gt; Before he was won over by fascism, Eliade defined Romanianism as "neither fascism nor chauvinism—rather, the mere desire to realize an organic, unitary, ethnic, balanced state".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p.135-136&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crusade's version of the concept borrowed from all sides of the debate. In his "democracy sickens us" essay, Stelescu proposed: "Romanianism is the only credo that might invigorate this nation. Solutions for its sons, from its bosom, within its spirit, on its soil".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p.60&lt;/ref&gt; According to Talex, this brand of Romanianism was "noble and creative", Istrati being its leading exponent.&lt;ref name="zoistrscriit"/&gt; When first introduced to Gandhism and the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] in 1930, Istrati himself had declared: "To me, the Occident is dead."&lt;ref name="lbistratiind"/&gt; In 1934, Stelescu's newspaper noted with satisfaction that nationalism was even making its comeback in the Soviet Union. Reading the [[Printed media in the Soviet Union|Soviet press]], the Stelists remarked that references to the [[Comintern]] and the cause of [[proletarian internationalism]] were being discarded, and that [[Mother Russia]] was returning in force.&lt;ref&gt;"Presa de peste graniță", in ''Cruciada Românismului'', November 22, 1934, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Talex, who described himself as a "know-nothing" in political matters,&lt;ref name="mptalex"/&gt; had for a personal idol the nationalist historian [[Vasile Pârvan]]. He was especially inspired by Pârvan's [[Russophobia]], which colored his reading of Istrati's work.&lt;ref name="mptalex"/&gt; His admiration for "Romanianism" pitted him against the more cosmopolitan liberals of the day, prompting the Crusade's journalistic attacks against [[Eugen Lovinescu]], the doyen of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Romanian liberalism]]. Lovinescu (who had been Talex's high school teacher)&lt;ref name="mptalex"/&gt; was called "a con artist" in ''Cruciada Românismului''.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p.439-440&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Dowden''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|d|ən}}; 3 May 1843 – 4 April 1913), was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[critic]] and [[poet]].

==Biography==
He was the son of John Wheeler Dowden, a merchant and landowner, and was born at [[Cork (city)|Cork]], three years after his brother [[John Dowden|John]], who became [[Bishop of Edinburgh]] in 1886.  Edward's literary tastes emerged early, in a series of essays written at the age of twelve. His home education continued at [[Queen's College, Cork]] and at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]; at the latter he had a distinguished career, becoming president of the [[University Philosophical Society (Trinity College, Dublin)|Philosophical Society]], and winning the vice-chancellor's prize for English verse and prose, and the first [[senior moderatorship]] in [[ethics]] and [[logic]]. In 1867 he was elected professor of [[Eloquence|oratory]] and [[English literature]] in Dublin University.

Dowden's first book, ''Shakespeare, his Mind and Art'' (1875), resulted from a revision of a course of lectures, and made him widely known as a critic: translations appeared in [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]; his ''Poems'' (1876) went into a second edition. His ''Shakespeare Primer'' (1877) was  translated into [[Italian language|Italian]] and German. In 1878 the Royal Irish Academy awarded him the Cunningham gold medal "for his literary writings, especially in the field of Shakespearian criticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mocavo.com/Proceedings-of-the-Royal-Irish-Academy-2/125174/142#141| title= Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, 1878|accessdate = 10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later works by him in this field included an edition of ''The Sonnets of William Shakespeare'' (1881), ''Passionate Pilgrim'' (1883), ''Introduction to Shakespeare'' (1893), ''Hamlet'' (1899), ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1900), ''[[Cymbeline]]'' (1903), and an article entitled "Shakespeare as a Man of Science" (in the ''National Review'', July 1902), which criticized T.E. Webb's ''Mystery of William Shakespeare''. His critical essays "Studies in Literature" (1878), "Transcripts and Studies" (1888), "New Studies in Literature" (1895) showed a profound knowledge of the currents and tendencies of thought in various ages and countries; but his ''Life of Shelley'' (1886)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley|author=Dowden, Edward|year=1886|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001112864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley'' by Edward Dowden|journal=The Quarterly Review|date=April 1887|volume=164|pages=285–321|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b661337;view=1up;seq=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; made him best known to the public at large. In 1900 he edited an edition of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]'s works.

[[Image:Edward Dowden.png|thumb|right|Edward Dowden c.1874]]
Other books by him which indicate his interests in literature include: [[Robert Southey]] (in the "[[English Men of Letters]]" series, 1880), his edition of ''Southey's Correspondence with [[Caroline Bowles]]'' (1881), and ''Select Poems of Southey'' (1895), his Correspondence of Sir [[Henry Taylor (dramatist)|Henry Taylor]] (1888), his edition of [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]]'s ''Poetical Works'' (1892) and of his ''Lyrical Ballads'' (1890), his ''French Revolution and English Literature'' (1897; lectures given at [[Princeton University]] in 1896), ''History of French Literature'' (1897), ''Puritan and Anglican'' (1900), ''[[Robert Browning]]'' (1904) and ''[[Michel de Montaigne]]'' (1905). His devotion to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] led to his succeeding [[Max Müller]] in 1888 as president of the English Goethe Society.

In 1889 he gave the first annual [[Taylorian Lecture]] at the [[University of Oxford]], and from 1892 to 1896 served as  Clark lecturer at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. To his research are due, among other matters of literary interest, the first account of [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s ''Lectures on periods of European culture''; the identification of Shelley as the author of a review (in ''The Critical Review'' of December 1814) of a romance by [[Thomas Jefferson Hogg]]; a description of Shelley's ''Philosophical View of Reform''; a manuscript diary of [[Fabre d'Églantine]]; and a record by Dr [[Wilhelm Weissenborn]] of Goethe's last days and death. He also discovered a ''Narrative of a Prisoner of War under Napoleon'' (published in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''), an unknown pamphlet by [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]], some unpublished writings of [[William Hayley]] relating to [[William Cowper|Cowper]], and a unique copy of the ''Tales of Terror''.

His wide interests and scholarly methods made his influence on criticism both sound and stimulating, and his own ideals are well described in his essay on ''The Interpretation of Literature'' in his ''Transcripts and Studies''. As commissioner of education in Ireland (1896–1901), trustee of the [[National Library of Ireland]], secretary of the [[Irish Liberal Union]] and vice-president of the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]], he enforced his view that literature should not be divorced from practical life. His biographical/critical concepts, particularly in connection with Shakespeare, are played with by Stephen Dedalus in the library chapter of James Joyce's ''Ulysses''. Leslie Fiedler was to play with them again in ''The Stranger in Shakespeare''.

Dowden married twice, first (1866) Mary Clerke, and secondly (1895) Elizabeth Dickinson West, daughter of the dean of St Patrick's. His daughter by his first wife, [[Hester Dowden]], was a well-known spiritualist medium.

'''Ephemera''' (singular: '''ephemeron''') are any transitory written or printed matter not meant to be retained or preserved. The word derives from the Greek ''ephemeros'', meaning "lasting only one day, short-lived".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ephemera&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[collectible]] ephemera are advertising [[trade cards]], [[air sickness bag|airsickness bags]], [[bookmark]]s, catalogues, [[greeting cards]], letters, [[pamphlet]]s, [[postcard]]s, [[poster]]s, [[Prospectus (finance)|prospectuses]], defunct [[stock certificate]]s or [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]]s, and [[zine]]s.

==Etymology==
Ephemera (ἐφήμερα) is a noun, the plural neuter of ephemeron and ephemeros, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[New Latin]] for ἐπί – epi "on, for" and ἡμέρα – hemera "day" with the ancient sense extending to the [[mayfly]] and other short lived insects and flowers and for something which lasts a day or a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ephemera | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ephemera | publisher=The Free Dictionary | accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printed ephemera==
[[File:Stallion Phoenomenon.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 1798 printed [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]] advertising the availability of a [[stallion]] for horse-breeding]]
In [[library and information science]], the term ephemera also describes the class of published single-sheet or single page documents which are meant to be thrown away after one use. This classification excludes simple letters and photographs with no printing on them, which are considered [[manuscript]]s or [[typescript]]s.  Large academic and [[national library|national libraries]] and museums may collect, organize, and preserve ephemera as [[history]]. A particularly large and important example of such an archive is the John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/johnson/johnson.htm Bodley.ox.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Bodleian Library]], [[Oxford]]. Over 2,000 images from the John Johnson Collection are available to search online for free at [[VADS (organisation)|VADS]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vads.ac.uk/results.php?cmd=advsearch&amp;words=john+johnson&amp;field=all&amp;oper=or&amp;words2=&amp;field2=all&amp;mode=boolean&amp;submit=search&amp;JJPP=1&amp;JJTP=1 VADS (the Visual Arts Data Service)]&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 65,000 items are available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://johnjohnson.chadwyck.co.uk/marketing.do Johnjohnson.chadwyck.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;  The extensive [[Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection]] from the [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] gathers 32,000 [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] greeting cards and 450 [[Valentine's Day]] cards dating from the early nineteenth century, printed by the major publishers of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = MMU Special Collections - Victorian Ephemera| publisher = [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]| date = | url =http://www.specialcollections.mmu.ac.uk/victoria.php| author = |accessdate = November 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ephemera Kabinett at the Los-Angeles–based [[Institute of Cultural Inquiry]] contains 'first' items from cultural turning points of the last two decades, such as a copy of the first [[Marvel Comics|Marvel comic]] in which a lead character comes out of the closet and one of the first [[Red ribbon|AIDS red ribbons]].&lt;ref&gt;Florenkowsky, Emilie. [http://www.meta-magazine.com/articles/inquiry-into-the-institute-of-cultural-inquiry "Inquiry into the Institute of Cultural Inquiry."] Meta magazine, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video and audio ephemera==
By extension, '''video ephemera''' and '''audio ephemera''' refer to transitory audiovisual matter not intended to be retained or preserved.  Surprisingly, the great bulk of video and audio expression has, until recently, been ephemeral.  Early TV broadcasts were not preserved (indeed, the technology to preserve them postdates the invention of television).  Even if radio and television stations preserve archives of their broadcasts, those backcatalogs are inaccessible in practice to the general public, leaving it to a small number of underground [[tape trading|tape traders]] to exchange the rare, lucky moments when something unexpected or historical came across the air.

An article on the Ephemera Society of America website notes
&lt;blockquote&gt;Printed ephemera gave way to audio and video ephemera in the twentieth century. ... These present even more of a preservation problem than printed materials. Although seldom made available for libraries, when videotapes are acquired for archival preservation they are found to be made on low quality tape, poorly processed, and damaged from abuse by users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ephemerasociety.org/articles/lla-phillips.html "'I Like Ike': Collecting Political Ephemera", Faye Philips]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The large capacity and reach provided by resources such as the [[Internet Archive#Media collections|Internet Archive]] and [[YouTube]] have made finding and sharing video ephemera (past and present) dramatically easier.

'''''Errors and Expectations: A Guide for the Teacher of Basic Writing''''', published in 1977 by [[Oxford University Press]], by [[Mina P. Shaughnessy]], was the first book-length investigation of writing problems experienced by under-prepared college freshmen.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  At the time of the book’s publication, Shaughnessy was the director of the Instructional Resource Center and an associate dean of [[CUNY]], having previously worked both as a [[basic writing]] (BW) instructor and the director of basic writing at [[City College of New York|City College]] in [[New York City|New York]].

The book grew out of Shaughnessy’s nine years’ experience teaching basic writing to [[open admissions]] students.  Overwhelmed by the error-ridden compositions produced by her students, she systematically analyzed 4,000 placement essays written by incoming freshmen at City College in order to better understand the logic of student errors in composition.  This research—funded in part by the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] grant—coupled with her own experience provides the foundation of the book which seeks both to inform basic writing instructors and provide them with a means for approaching their students’ areas of weakness. Perhaps the central and most important observation [[Mina P. Shaughnessy|Shaughnessy]] makes is that there is a pattern to student error.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Alison. Review. ''The School Review'' 86.2 (February 1978): 292-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==

''Errors and Expectations'' devotes a chapter to eight of the (at the time) most salient considerations in basic writing.  Each chapter follows a three-pronged format: first, a range of examples; second, an explanation of causes of the problems; and third, suggestions with which to approach the problems.  Although more than forty years have passed since the book’s original publication date, the majority of the information remains pertinent and insightful today.

'''Chapter 1: Introduction.'''  Shaughnessy discusses the background of the open admissions movement, detailing her own experience when she begins to grade the essays produced by her first group of open admissions students and finds herself unprepared to proceed in spite of previous years of experience in teaching composition.  She also provides a rationale for her focus on error, explaining the realities of academia, the ways in which errors are viewed, and the relationship between reader and writer.

'''Chapter 2: [[Handwriting]] and [[punctuation]].'''  After briefly discussing handwriting, the bulk of the chapter (27 of 29 pages) focuses on the myriad ways in which basic writers use and misuse punctuation.  In order to understand the logic behind the errors, Shaughnessy explores the concept of the sentence and the differences between spoken and written English.  Commas, periods, and capitalization are the primary elements examined.

'''Chapter 3: [[Syntax]].'''  Four general categories of error are examined (accidental errors, blurred patterns, consolidation errors, and inversions) in the context of the academic tone which college students are expected to adopt and with which basic writers often struggle as they expand their writing ability.

'''Chapter 4: Common errors.'''  Shaughnessy provides examples in the primary problem areas of verbs, nouns, pronouns, and subject-verb agreement before discussing the discouragement felt by teachers and students alike as they approach the recurring common errors present in student writing.  She offers simple suggestions for reducing error and provides a thorough diagnostic test.

'''Chapter 5: [[Spelling]].'''  Shaughnessy first makes a distinction between misspelling and incorrectly inflecting various parts of speech before classifying spelling mistakes under four heads: problems with the spelling system, incongruities between spoken and written English, ignorance of spelling rules, and the inexperienced eye.  She suggests nine steps in addressing spelling problems and warns against two general assumptions—that adult students can’t be taught how to spell correctly and that spelling can only be taught one way.

'''Chapter 6: [[Vocabulary]].'''  Basic writing students enter college without having developed the vocabulary of academia, a slow-growing task that generally takes years to accomplish.  Shaughnessy compares the writing of basic, intermediate, and advanced freshman writers to discuss their vocabulary skills and the depth of ideas investigated through vocabulary.  She also indicates basic writing students’ needs as they approach vocabulary-rich courses (such as biology or anatomy).

'''Chapter 7: Beyond the sentence.'''  Although many teachers complain that basic writing students lack ideas, Shaughnessy claims that their ideas are hidden by their novice skills and attempts at elaboration.  She suggests three needs specific to BW students: how to arrive at a main idea, how to see and create structure in writing, and how to recognize specific patterns that link together sentences and paragraphs.

'''Chapter 8: Expectations.'''  Shaughnessy discusses the powerful link between expectations and achievement, showing sample essays from the beginning and end of a semester course and citing statistics that demonstrate the effectiveness of basic writing courses.

== Reception and Influence ==
Over 12,000 hardcover copies were sold within six months after it was published (the typical number for a scholarly book with a focused topic was 1,000{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}), and by 1979, more than 40,000 paperback copies had been sold.[http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/basicbib/content/ht_bwdc.html#24] The book has been cited as one of the most important and influential studies of basic writing, relevant for teachers of both remedial courses and writing in general.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Susan. Review. ''Rhetoric Society Quarterly'' 8.2 (Spring 1978): 63-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, Shaughnessy’s work has been criticized for a variety of reasons: devoting so much time to grammar instruction;&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Harvey S. Review. ''College English'' 38.7 (March 1977): 715-17.&lt;/ref&gt; categorizing only the errors of finished products, rather than the errors of each draft; and focusing so completely on error, despite the fact that she herself insists that error correction should not be the only focus of a basic writing course,&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Roy F. Review. ''The English Journal'' 67.7 (October 1978): 86.&lt;/ref&gt; among others.{{Which|date=December 2009}}

{{For|Wikipedia's FAQs|Wikipedia:FAQ}}
'''Frequently asked questions''' ('''FAQ'''), also '''Questions and Answers''' ('''Q&amp;A'''), are listed questions and answers, all supposed to be commonly asked in some context, and pertaining to a particular topic. The format is commonly used on email mailing lists and other online forums, where certain common questions tend to recur.

"FAQ" is pronounced as either an [[initialism]] (F-A-Q) or an [[acronym]]. Since the acronym ''FAQ'' originated in textual media, its [[pronunciation]] varies; "F-A-Q",&lt;ref name=pron&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/faqs/about-faqs/ |title=About FAQs: Pronunciation |publisher=Faqs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly heard. Depending on usage, the term may refer specifically to a single frequently asked question, or to an assembled list of many questions and their answers. Web page designers often label a single list of questions as an "FAQ", such as on [[Google Search|Google.com]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
| title = FAQ
| url = http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/faq/
| publisher = [[Google]]
| accessdate = May 30, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt; while using "FAQs" to denote multiple lists of questions such as on [[United States Department of the Treasury|United States Treasury]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
| title = OFAC FAQs: Question Index
| url = http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/ques_index.aspx
| publisher = [[United States Department of the Treasury]]
| accessdate = May 30, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
While the name may be recent, the FAQ format itself is quite old. For example, [[Matthew Hopkins]] wrote ''The Discovery of Witches'' in 1647 as a list of questions and answers, introduced as "Certain Queries answered". Many old [[catechism]]s are in a question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) format. ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', written by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the second half of the 13th century, is a series of common questions about Christianity to which he wrote a series of replies. [[Plato#The dialogues|Plato's dialogues]] are even older.

===On the Internet===
The "FAQ" is an [[Internet]] textual tradition originating from the technical limitations of early mailing lists from [[NASA]] in the early 1980s. The first FAQ developed over several pre-Web years, starting from 1982 when storage was expensive. On [[ARPANET]]'s SPACE mailing list, the presumption was that new users would download archived past messages through [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]]. In practice this rarely happened, and the users tended to post questions to the mailing list instead of searching its archives. Repeating the "right" answers became tedious, and went against developing [[netiquette]]. A series of different measures were set up by loosely affiliated groups of computer system administrators, from regularly posted messages to [[netlib]]-like query [[email]] [[Daemon (computer software)|daemons]]. The acronym ''FAQ'' was developed between 1982 and 1985 by Eugene Miya of NASA for the SPACE mailing list.&lt;ref name=faqsaboutfaqs&gt;Hersch, Russ. [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/faqs/about-faqs/ FAQs about FAQs]. 8 January 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The format was then picked up on other mailing lists and [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]]s. Posting frequency changed to monthly, and finally weekly and daily across a variety of mailing lists and newsgroups. The first person to post a weekly FAQ was [[Jef Poskanzer]] to the Usenet [news:net.graphics net.graphics]/[news:comp.graphics comp.graphics] [[newsgroup]]s. Eugene Miya experimented with the first daily FAQ.

Meanwhile, on Usenet, [[Mary Ann Horton|Mark Horton]] had started a series of "Periodic Posts" (PP) which attempted to answer trivial questions with appropriate answers.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Periodic summary messages posted to Usenet newsgroups attempted to reduce the continual reposting of the same basic questions and associated wrong answers. On Usenet, posting questions which are covered in a group's FAQ came to be considered poor netiquette, as it showed that the poster has not done the expected background reading before asking others to provide answers. Some groups may have multiple FAQs on related topics, or even two or more competing FAQs explaining a topic from different points of view.

Another factor on early ARPANET mailing lists was people asking questions promising to 'summarize' received answers, then either neglecting to do this or else posting simple concatenations of received replies with little-to-no quality checking.

==Modern developments==
Originally the term "FAQ" referred to the Frequently Asked Question itself, and the compilation of questions and answers was known as a "FAQ list" or some similar expression. The term became more frequently used to refer to the list, and a text consisting of questions and their answers is often called a FAQ regardless of whether the questions are actually ''frequently'' asked, if they are asked at all, or if there is even any way of asking questions.

In some cases, informative documents not in the traditional FAQ style have also been described as FAQs, particularly the [[videogame|video game]] FAQ, which is often a detailed description of gameplay, including tips, secrets, and beginning-to-end guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-09-09-what-the-faq-article|title=What the FAQ?|last=Teti|first=John|date=9 September 2010|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely are videogame FAQs in a question-and-answer format, although they may contain a short section of questions and answers.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Over time, the accumulated FAQs across all Usenet newsgroups sparked the creation of the "*.answers" moderated newsgroups such as [news:comp.answers comp.answers], [news:misc.answers misc.answers] and [news:sci.answers sci.answers] for [[crossposting]] and collecting FAQ across respective comp.*, misc.*, sci.* newsgroups.

The '''Golden Bull of 1242''' was a [[golden bull]] or [[edict]], issued by King [[Béla IV of Hungary]] to the inhabitants of [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gradec]] (part of today's [[Zagreb]], the capital of [[Croatia]]) during the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]]. By this golden bull, King Béla IV proclaimed Gradec a [[royal free city]].&lt;ref name=posta.hr&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.posta.hr/default.aspx?id=3622&amp;m=39 | title=750th anniversary of the Golden Bull granted by Bela IV | publisher=[[Croatian Post]] | accessdate=18 February 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113220/http://www.posta.hr/default.aspx?id=3622&amp;m=39 | archivedate=4 March 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The document was issued on 16 November 1242 in [[Virovitica]] and reaffirmed in 1266.&lt;ref name="enciklopedija"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zlatna bula Bele IV.|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=67295|website=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography]]|accessdate=13 June 2017|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original is written on a piece of [[parchment]] {{convert|57|by|46|cm}} in size, and is kept in strictly controlled conditions in the [[Croatian State Archives]] in Zagreb, while a copy is exhibited in the [[Zagreb City Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zlatna bula – povijesni dokument Zagreba|url=http://hupzagreb.com/blog/predstavljamo-zlatnu-bulu-najvazniji-i-najvrjedniji-povijesni-dokument-zagreba/|website=hupzagreb.com|accessdate=13 June 2017|language=hr-HR|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provisions ==
The Golden Bull declared and proclaimed "a free royal city on Gradec, the hill of Zagreb". The town was to be presided by a "city judge" ({{lang-hr|gradski sudac}}, {{lang-la|iudex}}), who was elected yearly by the citizenry and fulfilled the role of the [[mayor]]. In addition, eight jurors ({{lang-la|jurati}}) and twenty city councillors were elected each year on 3 February, the Feast of [[St. Blaise]].{{sfn|Škreblin|2014|pp=25–26}} Gradec remained ruled by the ''iudex'' until 1850, when Gradec, Kaptol and several other municipalities were formally unified into a new royal city of Zagreb.{{sfn|Šašić|1998}}

The edict brought many benefits and freedoms to Gradec's inhabitants. Among others, it stated that the towns were subject directly to the King, not to the nobles whose estate they were situated on. This also brought it outside the jurisdiction of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb|Diocese of Zagreb]], which collected revenue from large land holdings, and was headquartered on the neighbouring hill of [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]]; during the Middle Ages, conflicts would often break out between the citizens of Gradec and [[canon (priest)|canon]]s of Kaptol, sometimes resulting in civil wars.{{sfn|Škreblin|2014|pp=25–26}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Milčec|first=Zvonimir|title=Krvavi Most|url=http://www.zagreb.hr/krvavi-most/28046|website=Zagreb.hr|publisher=City of Zagreb|accessdate=13 June 2017|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens also gained freedom of movement, free use of their property,{{sfn|Škreblin|2014|p=27}} and the freedom to freely draw up their own testament. In addition, they were absolved of paying road and bridge tolls in the Croatian-Hungarian Kingdom.&lt;ref name="enciklopedija" /&gt;

In return for the privileges gained, the citizens were required to erect fortifications around the town at their own expense, which they did in 1266.{{sfn|Šašić|1998}} They were also required to supply the king with "12 oxen, 1000 loaves of bread and 4 barrels of wine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zlatna bula Bele IV.|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=67295|website=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography]]|accessdate=13 June 2017|language=hr|quote=U slučaju kraljeva posjeta Gradecu, građani su trebali za njegov i objed njegove pratnje osigurati »12 volova, 1000 kruhova i 4 bačve vina«...}}&lt;/ref&gt; in case of a royal visit, and ten armed soldiers in case of war. The latter requirement was repealed by the king in 1266. The citizens also had to provide for a visit by the [[Duke of Slavonia]] or [[Ban of Croatia]] (only one visit for the Ban).&lt;ref name="enciklopedija" /&gt;

The bull also defined the borders of land controlled by Gradec—the city was entitled to land south of the ridge of the [[Medvednica]] mountain, west of [[Vrapčak]] stream and north of the [[Sava|Sava River]].&lt;ref name="enciklopedija" /&gt;

== Motive ==
[[File:Gornji grad aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Gradec today]]
The Golden Bull of 1242 was only one in a series of proclamations of royal privileges to towns.&lt;ref name="narod.hr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kralj Bela IV Gradecu izdao Zlatnu bulu kojom je postao slobodni kraljevski grad – narod.hr|url=https://narod.hr/kultura/kralj-bela-iv-gradecu-izdao-zlatnu-bulu-kojom-je-postao-slobodni-kraljevski-grad|website=Narod.hr|accessdate=15 June 2017|language=hr-HR|date=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years preceding the Golden Bull, Mongols had invaded Europe under [[Batu Khan]]'s command. In early 1241 they reached Hungary, bringing defeat in April that year at the [[Battle of Mohi]] on the [[Sajó River]]. King Béla IV and the royal family hid from the Mongols in Zagreb. In the winter of 1241–42, Mongols crossed the frozen [[Drava]] and [[Danube]] rivers. The king fled to [[Dalmatia]] as Mongols approached the poorly fortified Zagreb, which they levelled and burnt to the ground.{{sfn|Šašić|1998}} The recently consecrated [[Zagreb Cathedral]] was razed by the invading army.&lt;ref name=narod.hr/&gt; The Mongol army continued pursuing Béla until March, when the word of [[Great Khan]] [[Ögedei]]'s death reached them, and they retreated to Central Asia.{{sfn|Šašić|1998}} Following the cease of hostilities, and in anticipation of a new invasion, Béla IV issued dozens of privileges encouraging the building of [[fortifications|fortified]] urban settlements, as these turned out to be the only viable holdouts during the war.{{sfn|Škreblin|2014|p=27}}

== Impact ==
Helped by its location at the intersection of two important trade routes,{{sfn|Škreblin|2014|p=28}} the new town of Gradec—protected by stone walls, unlike its neighbour Kaptol—reached a population of around 3,000 in the 14th century,{{sfn|Škreblin|2014|p=26}} which made it a sizable city in then largely rural Central Europe.{{sfn|Škreblin|2014|p=28}} It was also a financial centre of the Croatian-Hungarian Kingdom, as it held a silver [[mint (facility)|mint]], and was the base of the [[thirtieth (tax)|thirtieth]] tax collection in [[Slavonia]], a major source of employment for the town.{{sfn|Škreblin|2014|p=29}} In 1267, the citizens of Gradec were absolved of paying the thirtieth.&lt;ref name="enciklopedija" /&gt; As a royal free city, Gradec was also allowed to hold daily and weekly tax-free fairs, as well as a fortnightly fair around the Feast of [[St. Mark]] (held from 17 April to 3 May), which was first held in 1256,{{sfn|Škreblin|2014|p=29}}&lt;ref name="enciklopedija" /&gt; on [[St. Mark's Square, Zagreb|St. Mark's Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vidaković|first1=Senka|title=U Zagrebu otvoren Markov sajam – festival starih zanata|url=http://magazin.hrt.hr/336213/markov-sajam-festival-starih-zanata|website=[[Croatian Radiotelevision]]|accessdate=19 June 2017|language=hr|date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The St. Mark's fair was revived at the turn of the 21st century, and continues in the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dabo Hunjak|first1=Emina|title=Otvoren festival starih zanata – Markov sajam :: Radio Sljeme|url=http://radio.hrt.hr/radio-sljeme/clanak/otvoren-festival-starih-zanata-markov-sajam/147273/|website=[[Croatian Radiotelevision]]|accessdate=13 June 2017|language=hr|date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1992, the city of Zagreb celebrated the 750th anniversary of the Golden Bull. An exhibition was held by the Zagreb City Museum and the {{ill|Zagreb State Archive|hr|Državni arhiv u Zagrebu}} to commemorate this occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stublić|first1=Zlatko|title=Zlatna bula 1242.-1992.|url=http://www.mgz.hr/hr/izlozbe/zlatna-bula-1242-1992,13.html|website=[[Zagreb City Museum]]|accessdate=13 June 2017|language=hr|date=15 November 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huxley Hoard at the Museum of Liverpool 6.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Lead fragments found with the Huxley Hoard]]
The '''Huxley Hoard''' is a [[hoard]] of [[Viking]] jewellery from around 900-910 found buried near [[Huxley, Cheshire|Huxley]], [[Cheshire]], England. It consists of 21 silver [[bracelets]], one silver [[ingot]], and 39 [[lead]] fragments, weighing around {{convert|1.5|kg}} in total. The bracelets might have been produced by [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Norse]] settlers in [[Dublin]] and possibly buried for safekeeping by Viking refugees settling in [[Cheshire]] and the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] in the early 900's. It was discovered by Steve Reynoldson  in November 2004&lt;ref name="mol" /&gt; after he found fragments of lead {{convert|30|cm}} underground using a [[metal detector]].&lt;ref name="ca" /&gt;

The bracelets were folded flat, sixteen decorated by [[Punch (tool)|punched]] patterns, six with [[cross]]es stamped in their centre, and another six with centre cross and one at each end. Two have lattice patterns, one an [[hourglass]] stamp around the edge, one [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] with central and end crosses, and one (found as a twisted bar) a [[zig-zag]] pattern; the remaining four are plain. The lead fragments suggest the hoard could have been buried either in a lead sheet or a lead-lined wood box.&lt;ref name="mol" /&gt;

One of a cluster of hoards found in the [[Chester]] area,&lt;ref name="ca" /&gt; it was held by the [[British Museum]] until early 2007 before making a July 2007 debut at the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref name="culture24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="culture24" /&gt; A [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] grant&lt;ref name="heritagelottery" /&gt; of £45,000&lt;ref name="culture24" /&gt; enabled its purchase by joint owners [[Grosvenor Museum]], [[Cheshire Museums Service]] and [[National Museums Liverpool]],&lt;ref name="mol" /&gt; which have it on display at the [[Museum of Liverpool]].&lt;ref name="mol" /&gt; It was the subject of a book published by the National Museums Liverpool in 2010.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

'''Intermingling''', or [[heterophily]], from a sociological perspective includes the various forms of interactions between individuals that go against a particular society's [[Norm (social)|cultural norms.]]  These relationships stem from [[Interpersonal ties#Weak tie hypothesis|weak]] or [[absent ties]], which are contrary to [[Interpersonal ties#Strong ties hypothesis|strong ties]] and constitute of networks between individuals who know little or nothing about one another. Examples of intermingling can include networking, work-place romance, or cross-cultural dating.{{wiktionary}}

__TOC__

== Overview ==
Intermingling is the opposite of homophily and xenophobia but individuals tend to be less heterophilic and more homophilic- associating and bonding with individuals similar to themselves. Homophily is more prevalent than heterophily because the strength of all ties between any two people depend on the amount of time spent together, of mutual confiding, and of emotional intensity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Granovetter|first=Mark|date=May 1973|title=The Strength of Weak Ties|url=|journal=American Journal of Sociology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homophilic relationships are perceived to be easier to build and maintain as individuals feel they have a great deal in common.
  
Pertaining to the diffusion of relationships, intermingling and heterophily are perceived to create more damage. Thus, since individuals practice homophily tend to be strongly connected and hold strong ties between their groups, when an individual is removed from the group information is still passed easily among those who remain. Contrarily, in sectors where there is intermingling and the group fabricates weak ties and bridges (individuals who connect two strangers) the removal of an individual from this group threatens the continuation of relationships between the others left in the group.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Networking ==
[[Personal network]]s and [[Business networking|business networks]] are the social circles individuals find themselves within that are made up of strong and weak ties. The goal of these networks is to exchange information, act upon new opportunities, and have personal gain from the relationship. Intermingling has been known to enhance individuals' networking practices as heterophily is said to make people more successful through them being able to receive new information from weak ties. This conclusion comes from the observation of those who are perceived to be privileged and unprivileged (based on race, class, and gender) and how much in comparison to the other each group intermingles thus creating weak ties. The unprivileged groups (i.e. women, minorities, and lower classes) tend to be in small cliques with a very limited amount of weak ties meaning that their access to new opportunities and information is also limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giuffre|first=Katherine|last2=Paxton|first2=Pamela|date=July 1997|title=Building Social Networks|url=http://search.proquest.com/socabs/docview/223525952/fulltext/A752A4D55E134729PQ/1?accountid=10901|journal=Teaching Sociology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups have been known to only interact with each other causing information to be trapped within their own circle and no new information to enter into the circle. In [[Stanley Milgram|Stanley Milgram's]] [[Small-world experiment|Small World Problem]] this breach in the spread of new information is described as group inbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milgram|first=Stanley|date=May 1967|title=Small World Problem|url=http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/milgram67smallworld.pdf|journal=Psychology Today|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship diffusion ===
According to [[Mark Granovetter]] in his work the Strength of Weak Ties, intermingling is necessary in gaining access to new opportunities and personal gain as weak ties increase an individuals exposure to new information. Additionally, Granovetter's work found that information diffuses (spreads) more quickly and further when the network is made up of weak ties and bridges (individuals who connect two strangers). This is benefiting to individuals as information usually contain information on employment, business opportunities, and new ventures.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== In romantic relationships ==

Intermingling is a term sometimes used to refer to several different ideas regarding how people connect in [[love]] [[Exogamy|intermarriage]], [[cultural assimilation]], [[miscegenation]] (racial mixing). Note that the history of cultural exchange and inter-societal conflict has produced terms for "intermingling" concepts which are colored by various cultural and societal norms such as xenophobia and [[racism]].

=== Within the workplace ===
Intermingling in the workplace is considered and commonly called [[workplace romance]]. Intermingling within the workplace is considered a sexual attraction between two individuals who work within the same organization and the relationship is perceived within the eyes of a third party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Anderson|first = Claire|last2 = Fisher|first2 = Caroline|date = 1 August 1991|title = Male-Female Relationships in the Workplace: Perceived Motivations in Office Romance|url =|journal = Sex Roles|volume = 25-25|issue = 3–4|pages = 163–180|doi =10.1007/BF00289852|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workplace romance is deemed a form of intermingling because they are usually not approved or allowed by company officials leading it to be taboo dating practice.[[File:Triangular Theory of Love.gif|thumb|Triangular Theory of Love components]]The interactions that take place within the workplace are romantically charges as both individuals are voluntarily involved and the mingling that takes place is not forced or unwanted. Additionally the individuals are officially labeled as more than just co-workers once they act physically on their mutual romantic feelings for each other. This may come in the form of dating or casual sex.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Pierce|first = Charles|last2 = Byrne|first2 = Donn|date = January 1996|title = Attraction in organizations: a model of workplace romance|url =|journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior|doi =10.1002/(sici)1099-1379(199601)17:1&lt;5::aid-job734&gt;3.0.co;2-e|volume=17|pages=5–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confirmation of intermingling within the workplace context also must support Sternberg's [[triangular theory of love]] which states that loving relationships consist of three components; [[Intimate relationship|intimacy]] (which attracts the individuals to each other), [[Passion (emotion)|passion]] (which causes the need to express feelings through physical attention and sexual intercourse), and [[Promise|commitment]] (which leads to the individuals deciding to stick with each other).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Types of workplace romances ====

Relationships formed within the workplace are one of three types; hierarchical, lateral, or couples without direct interaction in their job description.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Bill og Melinda Gates 2009-06-03 (bilde 01).JPG|thumb|Bill and Melinda Gates]]
Relationships that are hierarchal within the place of employment happen when the involved individuals do not hold the same power in the context of their work. One individual's job position is seen as subordinate when compared to their significant other's position within the same company.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karl|first=Katherine|last2=Sutton|first2=Cynthia|date=Spring 2000|title=An examination of the perceived fairness of workplace romance|url=|journal=Journal of Business and Psychology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous examples of hierarchal romances include [[Bill Gates]] (CEO of [[Microsoft]]) and [[Melinda Gates|Melinda French]] (previous Product Manager of Microsoft),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/melinda-gates-turned-down-bill-gates-first-date|title=Why Melinda Gates Turned Bill Gates Down When He First Asked Her Out|website=PEOPLE.com|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]] (previous [[Associate attorney|Summer Associate]] at [[Sidley Austin|Sidley Austin - Chicago Branch]]) and [[Michelle Obama|Michelle Robinson]] (Barack's Summer Mentor/Advisor) ''see [[Michelle Obama#Family life|Obama - Family Life]]'', and the notorious romance between [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] and [[Monica Lewinsky]] (White House Intern) see [[Lewinsky scandal]].

Relationships that are lateral within the workplace are formed when the involved individuals are seen as holding equally powerful positions in their job descriptions. Persons participating in a lateral workplace romance can not be seen as superior or subordinate to one another.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Leaders of organizations favor lateral relationships more than hierarchal relationships even though neither are fully supported. The dynamics of hierarchal relationships within the work context can possibly lead to a higher number of claims of sexual harassment. The [[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]] case, which claimed that workplace romances are not excluded in the [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]], established that employers are responsible for the actions executed to their employees by the power-holding leaders of the institution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Also, hierarchal relationships can lead to conflict as the subordinate individual begins to be viewed by their co-workers as more favored than their equals. This favor is symbolized through pay raises, promotions, transfers, work load discrepancies and it usually leads to co-workers envying one another or carrying feelings of inequality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Couples who work for the same institution but have no direct interaction during their tasks at work may be two individuals who work in different departments or different sites. This form of dating stirs even less suspicions of favoritism than lateral and hierarchical forms of dating.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:HMS VIGILANT MOD 45137620.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The United Kingdom relies on four [[Vanguard-class submarine|''Vanguard''-class submarines]] to provide its nuclear deterrent. At least one submarine is always armed and on active service, carrying up to 16 [[Trident II]] [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s. Each missile has a range of 7000 miles (11,000&amp;nbsp;km), and can carry 12 independently controlled warheads each capable of destroying a large city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Brown move to cut UK nuclear subs |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8270092.stm |publisher= BBC News |date=23 September 2009 |accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The '''letters of last resort''' are four identically worded handwritten letters from the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] to the commanding officers of the four British [[Vanguard-class submarine|ballistic missile submarines]]. They contain orders on what action to take in the event that an enemy nuclear strike has destroyed the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] and has killed or otherwise incapacitated both the prime minister and the "second person" (normally a high-ranking member of [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|the Cabinet]]) whom the prime minister has designated to make a decision on how to act in the event of the prime minister's death. In the event that the orders were to be carried out, the action taken could be the last official act of [[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government]].&lt;ref name="Taylor 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=Every new British prime minister pens a handwritten ‘letter of last resort’ outlining nuclear retaliation | website=Washington Post | date=13 July 2016 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/13/every-new-british-prime-minister-pens-a-hand-written-letter-of-last-resort-outlining-nuclear-retaliaton/ | accessdate=13 July 2016 | last=Taylor | first=Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters are stored inside two nested safes in the control room of each submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Rosenbaum |first= Ron | authorlink= |author2= |date=January 2009 |title=The Letter of Last Resort |journal=Slate Magazine |volume= | issue = |pages= |id= |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2208219 |accessdate= 18 May 2009 |quote= In the control room of the sub, the Daily Mail reports, "there is a safe attached to a control room floor. Inside that, there is an inner safe. And inside that sits a letter. It is addressed to the submarine commander and it is from the Prime Minister.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letters are destroyed unopened after a prime minister leaves office, so their content remains known only to the prime minister who issued them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Rosenbaum |first= Ron | authorlink= |author2= |date=January 2009 |title=The Letter of Last Resort |journal=Slate Magazine |volume= | issue = |pages= |id= |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2208219 |accessdate= 18 March 2012 |quote= [E]very prime minister in recent years has written such a letter and ... letters that go unused (Tony Blair's for instance) are destroyed without being read.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The letters are written as soon as a new prime minister takes office, after being told by the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] "precisely what damage a [[Trident missile]] could cause".&lt;ref name="Norton-Taylor 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Norton-Taylor | first=Richard | title=Theresa May's first job: decide on UK's nuclear response | website=the Guardian | date=11 July 2016 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/12/theresa-mays-first-job-decide-on-uks-nuclear-response | accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are then delivered to the submarines, with the previous prime minister's letters being destroyed without being opened.&lt;ref name="Bunkall 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Bunkall | first=Alistair | title=May To Be Handed Keys To Nuclear Red Button | website=Sky News | date=13 July 2016 | url=http://news.sky.com/story/may-to-be-handed-keys-to-nuclear-red-button-10499943 | accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of the deaths of both the prime minister and the designated alternative decision-maker as a result of a nuclear strike, the commander(s) of the nuclear submarine(s) (at any time at least one is on patrol) would use a series of checks to ascertain whether the letters of last resort will have to be opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theresa May’s grim first task: Preparing for nuclear armageddon|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/the-grim-task-awaiting-theresa-may-preparing-for-nuclear-armageddon-uk-prime-minister-british-defense-letter-of-last-resort/|accessdate=15 July 2016|work=Politico|date=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Peter Hennessy]]'s book ''The Secret State: Whitehall and the Cold War, 1945 to 1970'', the process by which a {{sclass-|Vanguard|submarine}} commander would determine if the British government continues to function includes, amongst other checks, establishing whether [[BBC Radio 4]] continues broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HMS Apocalypse: Deep in the Atlantic, a submarine waits on alert with nuclear missiles that would end the world...|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1090400/HMS-Apocalypse-Deep-Atlantic-submarine-waits-alert-nuclear-missiles-end-world--.html|accessdate=10 May 2012 | location=London|work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2017}}

In 1983, the procedure for [[UK Polaris programme|Polaris]] submarines was to open the envelopes if there was an evident nuclear attack, or if all UK naval broadcasts had ceased for four hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last= Goodall| first= David| publication-date=1 August 2013

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Options==
While the contents of these letters are secret, according to the December 2008 BBC Radio 4 documentary ''The Human Button'', there were four known options given to the prime minister to include in the letters.  The prime minister instructs the submarine commander to:

* retaliate with [[nuclear weapon]]s;
* not retaliate;
* use his or her own judgement; or
* place the submarine under an allied country's command, if possible.  The documentary mentions Australia and the United States.

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported in 2016 that the options are said to include: "Put yourself under the command of the US, if it is still there", "Go to Australia", "Retaliate", or "Use your own judgement".&lt;ref name="Norton-Taylor 2016" /&gt;

The actual option chosen remains known only to the writer of the letter, as they are destroyed unopened when a Prime Minister leaves office. In a debate prior to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]] the opposition leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]], a lifelong anti-nuclear weapons campaigner, stated that he would write the letters of last resort if elected but did not state what option he would choose, while also saying that any use of nuclear weapons would be a “disaster”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Lifelong anti-nuclear campaigner Jeremy Corbyn says he’ll issue orders to Trident commanders | website=Metro | date=29 May 2017 | url=https://metro.co.uk/2017/05/29/lifelong-anti-nuclear-campaigner-jeremy-corbyn-says-hell-issue-orders-to-trident-commanders-6670785/ | accessdate=20 Jun 2018 | last=Smith | first=Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
[[David Greig (dramatist)|David Greig]]'s 2012 play ''The Letter of Last Resort'' deals with the consequences and paradoxes of the letters.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Greig (dramatist)|David Greig]], ''[http://www.front-step.co.uk/2015/09/30/letter-of-last-resort/ The Letter of Last Resort]'' (full text of play), front-step.co.uk (David Greig's official website), posted 30 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was first staged in February 2012 as a part of a cycle of plays on "The Bomb" at the [[Tricycle Theatre]] in London, directed by [[Nicolas Kent]], with [[Belinda Lang]] playing the role of the incoming prime minister and [[Simon Chandler]] her advisor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]], [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/feb/21/the-bomb-review The Bomb - review], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The production was also seen at the [[Traverse Theatre]] in Edinburgh, for the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] later the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tricycle.co.uk/home/about-the-tricycle-pages/about-us-tab-menu/archive/archived-theatre-production/the-letter-of-last-resort/ Edinburgh Transfer: The Letter of Last Resort], [[Tricycle Theatre]], August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year it was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]], with the same cast, first transmitted on 1 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Saturday Drama, The Last Resort|work=BBC Radio 4 website|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0210spc|date=1 June 2013|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KGB's attempts to obtain the contents of the letters of last resort are part of the plot of the BBC [[Cold War]] spy drama ''[[The Game (UK TV series)|The Game]]'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Frost |first1=Vicky |title=The Game recap: series one, episode two – Operation Glass is revealed |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/may/07/the-game-recap-series-one-episode-two-operation-glass-is-revealed |accessdate=14 November 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=7 May 2015 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6117">'''Loan words in [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialects|Sri Lankan Tamil]]''' came about mostly due contact between [[Colonialism|colonial]] powers and the native population. Linguists study a language's lexicon for a number of reasons. Languages such as Tamil with centuries of [[Tamil literature|literature]] and multi-cultural contact offer the chance to compare the various processes of lexical change. The words of foreign origin or [[loanword]]s illustrate those processes: [[calque]]s, [[loanword]]s, the distinction between [[function word]]s and content words.

''Note: For information on the transcription used, see [[National Library at Calcutta romanization]] and [[Tamil script]].

==European contribution==
[[Sri Lankan Tamil dialects]] are distinct from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] dialects used in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and other states of India. They are used in Sri Lanka and in the [[Tamil diaspora]]. Linguistic borrowings from European colonizers such as the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[England|English]] and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] have also contributed to a unique vocabulary that is distinct from the colloquial usage of Tamil in the Indian mainland. Furthermore, a form of Tamil spoken exclusively by [[Sri Lankan Moors]] has been strongly influenced by [[Arabic]]. Words that are peculiar to [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialect]]s are marked with an asterisk (*). 

===Portuguese===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Portuguese language]] --&gt;
Most Portuguese loan words are for items the native population lacked when the encounter happened c. 1505. Some are administrative terms, others are personal usage terms as well as items directly introduced from [[South America]] via the Portuguese traders. Most of these words are also shared with [[Sinhalese language]] users.

==Sinhalese==
Loanwords from the neighbouring [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] are quite sparse in Sri Lankan Tamil (as opposed to the large number of [[List of Sinhalese words of Tamil origin|Tamil loan words in Sinhala]]), which is most likely due to the relative isolation of the exclusively Tamil-speaking settlements in the North and East of the island.

The works of [[William Gibson]] encompass literature, journalism, acting, recitation, and performance art. Primarily renowned as a novelist and short fiction writer in the [[cyberpunk]] milieu, Gibson invented the metaphor of [[cyberspace]] in "[[Burning Chrome]]" (1982) and emerged from obscurity in 1984 with the publication of his [[debut novel]] ''[[Neuromancer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

At the turn of the 1990s, after the completion of his [[Sprawl trilogy]] of novels, Gibson contributed the text to a number of performance art pieces and exhibitions,&lt;ref name="remembering"/&gt;&lt;ref name="architecture"&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Goldberger |title=In San Francisco, A Good Idea Falls With a Thud |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DB103CF931A2575BC0A966958260 |work=Architecture View |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=1990-08-12 |accessdate=2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=skier/&gt; as well as writing lyrics for musicians [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] and [[Debbie Harry]].&lt;ref name=technodon/&gt;&lt;ref name="debravation"/&gt; He wrote the critically acclaimed artist's book ''[[Agrippa (a book of the dead)]]'' in 1992 before co-authoring ''[[The Difference Engine]]'', an alternate history novel that would become a central work of the [[steampunk]] genre.&lt;ref name="steampunkt"&gt;{{cite news | first = Peter | last = Bebergal | title = The age of steampunk | url = http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/26/the_age_of_steampunk/ | publisher = [[The Boston Globe]] | page = 3 | date = 2007-08-26 | accessdate = 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then spent an unfruitful period as a Hollywood [[screenwriter]], with few of his projects seeing the light of day and those that did being critically unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/johnny_mnemonic/ Johnny Mnemonic] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Retrieved 2008-01-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he had largely abandoned short fiction by the mid-1990s, Gibson returned to writing novels, completing his second trilogy, the [[Bridge trilogy]] at the close of the millennium. After writing two episodes of the television series ''[[The X-Files]]'' around this time, Gibson was featured as the subject of a documentary film, ''[[No Maps for These Territories]]'', in 2000.&lt;ref name="nomaps"&gt;{{cite video |people=Mark Neale (director), William Gibson (subject) |title=[[No Maps for These Territories]] |publisher=Docurama |medium=Documentary |date=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson has been invited to address the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (1993) and the [[Directors Guild of America]] (2003) and has had a plethora of articles published in outlets such as ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''. His third trilogy of novels, ''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]'' (2003), ''[[Spook Country]]'' (2007) and ''[[Zero History]]'' (2010) have put Gibson's work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030510/ai_n12684401 |title=Books: Hardbacks |accessdate=2007-07-08 |last=Hirst |first=Christopher |date=2003-05-10 |publisher=[[The Independent]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013205201/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030510/ai_n12684401 |archivedate=2007-10-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''London lore: the legends and traditions of the world's most vibrant city''''' is a 2008 book by [[Steve Roud]], concerning the [[folklore]] and history of [[London]]. Another edition was published in 2010. 

==Background==
The book presents various unique stories and traditions to come from historical London, such as [[Spring-heeled Jack]] and [[Pearly Kings and Queens]].

==Reception==
In ''[[The Guardian]]'' Nicholas Lezard chose the book as a favourite and wrote ' it doesn't matter if you're reading this in London, Glasgow or Smolensk: you're going to find this an enthralling book. Assuming, that is, that you are interested in superstitions, magic, legends, history and the endless parade of human credulity'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/24/london-lore-legends-traditions-round&lt;/ref&gt; [[Londonist]] described the book as 'an excellent tome'&lt;ref&gt;http://londonist.com/2008/10/book_review_london_lore_by_steve_ro.php&lt;/ref&gt; while in the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' [[Will Self]] wrote that he had been 'enthralled' by the book.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.standard.co.uk/standard-home/london-lore-the-legends-and-traditions-of-the-worlds-most-vibrant-city-by-steve-roud-6921589.html&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also praised by historian [[Peter Ackroyd]], in the ''[[Camden New Journal]]'' as 'fascinating' and 'admirably put together'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecnj.com/review/2009/012909/books012909_01.html&lt;/ref&gt; and 'a spellbinding study of our city's folklore' in the ''[[Newham Recorder]]''.

'''Museum Street''' is a street in the [[Bloomsbury]] area of the [[London Borough of Camden]], [[England]]. To the north is the [[British Museum]], hence its current name. The street is populated by cafes and bookshops to appeal to the international [[museum]]-going public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/regions/bloomsbury/museum-street.php Museum Street, Bloomsbury Shopping Guide], All In London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londononline.co.uk/area/Museum_Street_WC1A/ Shops on Museum Street, WC1A], LondonOnline.&lt;/ref&gt; To the north is Great Russell Street. To the south are [[Bloomsbury Way]] and [[New Oxford Street]]. The nearest tube stations are [[Tottenham Court Road tube station|Tottenham Court Road]] and [[Holborn tube station|Holborn]] to the southwest and southeast respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londontown.com/LondonStreets/museum_street_7df.html London guide to Museum Street, WC1A], LondonTown.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The street goes back to the 14th century and beyond. It remained largely rural until the late 17th century when the growth of London caused its urbanisation.  

Known as a thoroughfare since records began, it soon came to be known as ''Peter Street''.  The origins of this name are unsure though scholars agree {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} it is unlikely to have been an eminent Peter (notwithstanding perhaps St Peter) and more probable it derives from a [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]] manufactory which is thought to have existed there long before the British Museum opened in the 1750s.  During the early years the street was the site of hovels of slum tenements and rather unsavoury characters such as pickpockets and prostitutes.  An attempt at gentrification saw its name changed to ''Queen Street'' and it became home to parish schools to ensure the spiritual and secular education of poor children in London.  Around this time [[Charles Mudie]] opened his bookshop and stationers here, he soon explored the possibility of lending books as well as selling them and ''Mudie's Select Library'' proved so popular that it moved out to larger premises after ten years.  The street also became a rather fashionable area with many of the foremost writers of the day gathering in taverns to converse and debate.  [[Charles Dickens]] drank here when he was dedicating his energy to amateur dramatics, [[John Keats]], [[George Orwell]] and the [[Bloomsbury Set]] were also patrons.

On the corner of Great Russell Street at the northern end is the Museum Tavern, a [[public house]] that traces its origins back to 1723.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, John N. (1989). ''A history of the Museum Tavern in Bloomsbury''. London: Blemund's Books. {{ISBN|0-9514913-0-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1723 to 1762 the pub was called the ''Dog and Duck'' (so called because duck hunting was popular in the ponds in the Long Fields behind [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]] in the 17th and 18th centuries). The occult [[Atlantis Bookshop]] was opened on the street in 1922.

More recent history has seen the street set up as a paragon for pedestrian access.  [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]]'s 2003, ''Car Free Day'' saw the streetscape give right of way to foot passengers — a success which was heralded across [[Europe]] as an example of best practice in cutting vehicular noise and pollution.

Traditionalist Jews in [[Hungary]] were the first anywhere to form [[Schism in Hungarian Jewry|independent Orthodox Jewish organizations]] in the 19th century.]]
'''Orthodox Judaism''' is a collective term for the traditionalist branches of contemporary [[Judaism]]. [[Theology|Theologically]], it is chiefly defined by regarding the [[Torah]], both [[Written Torah|Written]] and [[Oral Torah|Oral]], as literally [[revelation|revealed]] by God on [[biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] and faithfully transmitted ever since. Orthodox Judaism therefore advocates a strict observance of Jewish Law, or ''[[Halakha]]'', which is to be [[Posek|interpreted]] only according to received methods and canonical sources, due to its divine origin. It regards the entire ''halakhic'' system as the unfolding and application of an immutable revelation, essentially beyond external and historical influence. Other key doctrines include belief in a future [[resurrection of the dead]], divine reward and punishment, the [[Election of Israel]] and an eventual [[Third Temple#Orthodox Judaism|restoration of the Temple]] in Jerusalem under the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]].

Orthodox Judaism is not a centralized denomination. Relations between its different subgroups are sometimes strained, and the exact limits of Orthodoxy are subject to intense debate. Very roughly, it may be divided between [[Ultra-Orthodox]] or "[[Haredi]]", which is more conservative, and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] which is relatively open to outer society. Each of those is itself formed of independent streams. While adhering to traditional beliefs, the movement is a modern phenomenon. It arose as a result of the breakdown of the autonomous Jewish community since the 18th century, and was much shaped by a conscious struggle against the pressures of [[secularization]] and rival alternatives. 

The strictly observant and theologically aware Orthodox are a definite minority among all Jews, but there are also numerous semi- and non-practicing persons who are officially affiliated or personally identifying with the movement. In total, Orthodox Judaism is the largest Jewish religious group, estimated to have over 2 million practicing adherents and at least an equal number of nominal members or self-identifying supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Those who choose to say [[Kaddish]] for a [[Yartzeit]] at an Orthodox synagogue. {{cite newspaper  |newspaper=The New York Daily News

==Definitions==
The earliest known mentioning of the term "Orthodox Jews" was made in the [[Berlinische Monatsschrift]] in 1795. The word "Orthodox" was borrowed from the general German [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] discourse, and used not to denote a specific religious group, but rather those Jews who opposed Enlightenment. During the early and mid-19th century, with the advent of the progressive movements among German Jews and especially early [[Reform Judaism]], the title "Orthodox" became the epithet of the traditionalists who espoused conservative positions on the issues raised by modernization. They themselves often disliked the alien, Christian name, preferring titles like "Torah-true" (''gesetztreu''), and often declared they used it only for the sake of convenience. The Orthodox leader Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] referred to "the conviction commonly designated as Orthodox Judaism"; in 1882, when Rabbi [[Azriel Hildesheimer]] became certain that the public understood that his philosophy and Liberal Judaism were radically different, he removed the word "Orthodox" from the name of his [[Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary|Rabbinical Seminary]]. By the 1920s, the term became common and accepted even in Eastern Europe, and remains as such.&lt;ref name="JB"/&gt;

Orthodoxy perceives itself ideologically as the only authentic continuation of Judaism throughout the ages, as it was until the crisis of modernity; in many basic aspects, such as belief in the unadulterated divinity of the Torah or strict adherence to precedent and tradition when ruling in matters of Jewish Law, Orthodoxy is indeed so. Its progressive opponents often shared this view, regarding it as a fossilized remnant of the past and lending credit to their own rivals' ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Salmon, Aviezer Ravitzky, Adam Ferziger. ''Orthodox Judaism: New Perspectives'' (in Hebrew). The Hebrew University Magnes Press, 2006. pp. 5-22, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the term "Orthodox" is often used generically to refer to traditional (even if only at the default sense, of being unrelated to the modernist non-Orthodox movements) synagogues, prayer rites, observances, and so forth.

However, academic research has taken a more nuanced approach, noting that the formation of Orthodox ideology and organizational frameworks was itself a product of modernity. It was brought about by the need to defend and buttress the very concept of tradition, in a world where it was not self-evident anymore. When deep secularization and the dismantlement of communal structures uprooted the old order of Jewish life, traditionalist elements united to form groups which had a distinct self-understanding. This, and all that it entailed, constituted a great change, for the Orthodox had to adapt to the new circumstances no less than anyone else; they developed novel, sometimes radically so, means of action and modes of thought. "Orthodoxization" was a contingent process, drawing from local circumstances and dependent on the extent of threat sensed by its proponents: a sharply-delineated Orthodox identity appeared in Central Europe, in [[Germany]] and [[Hungary]], by the 1860s; a less stark one emerged in Eastern Europe during the [[Interwar period]]. Among the [[History of the Jews under Muslim rule|Jews of the Muslim lands]], similar processes on a large scale only occurred around the 1970s, after they immigrated to Israel. Orthodoxy is often described as extremely conservative, ossifying a once-dynamic tradition due to the fear of legitimizing change. While this was not rarely true, its defining feature was not the forbidding of change and "freezing" Jewish heritage in its tracks, but rather the need to adapt to being but one segment of Judaism in a modern world inhospitable to traditional practice. Orthodoxy developed as a variegated "spectrum of reactions" – as termed by [[Benjamin Brown (scholar)|Benjamin Brown]] – involving in many cases much accommodation and leniency. Scholars nowadays, mainly since the mid-1980's, research Orthodox Judaism as a field in itself, examining how the need to confront modernity shaped and changed its beliefs, ideologies, social structure, and ''halakhic'' rulings, making it very much distinct from traditional Jewish society.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Benjamin Brown, [http://www.academia.edu/5121180/ The Varieties of Orthodox Responses, Ashkenazim and Sephardim (Hebrew)]. In: Aviezer Ravitzky, ''Shas: Cultural and Ideological Perspectives'', [[Am Oved]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
===Orthodox attitudes===
A definite and conclusive [[credo]] was never formulated in Judaism; the very question whether it contains any equivalent of [[dogma]] is a matter of intense scholarly controversy. Some researchers attempted to argue that the importance of daily practice and punctilious adherence to ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) relegated theoretical issues to an ancillary status. Others dismissed this view entirely, citing the debates in ancient rabbinic sources which castigated various [[Heresy in Judaism|heresies]] without any reference to observance. However, while lacking a uniform doctrine, Orthodox Judaism is basically united in affirming several core beliefs, disavowal of which is considered major [[blasphemy]]. As in other aspects, Orthodox positions reflect the mainstream of traditional [[Rabbinic Judaism]] through the ages.

Attempts to codify these beliefs were undertaken by several medieval authorities, including [[Saadia Gaon]] and [[Joseph Albo]]. Each composed his own creed. Yet the [[13 principles of faith|13 principles]] expounded by [[Maimonides]] in his ''[[Mishnah#Commentaries|Commentary on the Mishna]]'', authored in the 1160s, eventually proved the most widely accepted. Various points – for example, Albo listed merely three fundamentals, and did not regard the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]] as a key tenet – the exact formulation, and the status of disbelievers (whether mere errants or heretics who can no longer be considered part of the People Israel) were contested by many of Maimonides' contemporaries and later sages. But in recent centuries, the 13 principles became standard, and are considered binding and cardinal by Orthodox authorities in a virtually universal manner.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [[Marc B. Shapiro]]. ''The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised''. Littman Library of Jewish Civilization (2011). pp. 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, two systems of thought competed for theological primacy, their advocates promoting them as explanatory foundations for observance of the Law. One was the rationalist-philosophic school, which endeavored to present all commandments as serving higher moral and ethical purposes, while the other was the mystical tradition, exemplified in ''[[Kabbalah]]'', which assigned each rite with a role in the hidden dimensions of reality. Sheer obedience, without much thought and derived from faithfulness to one's community and ancestry, was believed fit only for the common people, while the educated classes chose either of the two schools. In the modern era, the prestige of both suffered severe blows, and "naive faith" became popular. At a time when excessive contemplation in matters of belief was associated with secularization, luminaries such as [[Israel Meir Kagan]] stressed the importance of simple, unsophisticated commitment to the precepts passed down from the Beatified Sages. This is still the standard in the ultra-Orthodox world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Brown (scholar)|Benjamin Brown]], ''[https://www.academia.edu/5157136 The Comeback of Simple Faith - The Ultra-Orthodox Concept of Religious Belief and Its Rise in the 19th Century]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more open Orthodox circles, attempts were made to formulate philosophies that would confront modern sensibilities. Notable examples are the [[Hegel]]ian-Kabbalistic theology of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who viewed history as progressing toward a Messianic redemption in a dialectic fashion which required the strengthening of heretical forces, or the existentialist thought of [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], who was deeply influenced by [[Neo-Kantian]] ideals. On the fringes of Orthodoxy, thinkers who were at least (and according to their critics, only) sociologically part of it, ventured toward radical models. These, like the [[Apophatic theology|apopathic]] views of [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] or the Feminist interpretation of [[Tamar Ross]], had little to no influence on the mainstream.

Orthodox Judaism [[Shema Yisrael|affirms]] [[monotheism]], the belief in one, and only one, deity. This is said several times per day in the prayers, including those said when going to sleep (men and women, girls and boys).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bedtime Shema  |website=MyJewishLearning.com

|title=Why Say Shema at Bedtime? - Didn't we just say it in Maariv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic tenets, drawn from ancient sources like the Talmud as well as later sages, include the attributes of [[God in Judaism]]: one and indivisible, preceding all creation which he alone brought into being, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent, absolutely incorporeal, and beyond human reason. Maimonides delineated this understanding of a [[monotheistic]], [[personal God]] in six articles concerning his status as the sole creator, his oneness, his impalpability, that he is first and last, that God alone may be worshipped, and no other being, and that he is omniscient.

===Revelation===
The defining doctrine of Orthodox Judaism is the belief that the [[Torah|Law]], both [[Written Torah|Written]] and [[Oral Torah|Oral]], was revealed by God to [[Moses]] on Mount Sinai, and that the Law was transmitted faithfully from Sinai in an unbroken chain ever since. One of the foundational texts of Rabbinic tradition is the list opening the [[Ethics of the Fathers]], enumerating the sages who received and passed on the Torah, from Moses through [[Joshua]], the Elders, and [[Hebrew Prophet|Prophets]], and then onward until [[Hillel the Elder]] and [[Shammai]].

The basic philosophy of Orthodoxy is that the body of revelation is total and complete; its interpretation under new circumstances, required of scholars in every generation, is conceived as an act of inferring and elaborating based on already prescribed methods, not of innovation or addition. One clause in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] asserts that anything which a veteran disciple shall teach was already given at Sinai; and a story in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] claims that upon seeing the immensely intricate deduction of future [[Rabbi Akiva]] in a vision, Moses himself was at loss until Akiva proclaimed that everything he teaches was handed over to Moses. Lacunae in received tradition or disagreements between early sages are attributed to disruptions, especially persecutions which caused to that "the Torah was forgotten in Israel" — according to Rabbinic lore, these eventually compelled the legists to write down the Oral Law in the [[Mishna]] and [[Talmud]] — but the wholeness of the original divine message and the reliability of those who transmitted it through the ages are axiomatic.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Meyer, ''Response to Modernity: A History of the Reform Movement in Judaism''. Wayne State University Press (1995). pp. 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eschatology===
{{Main|Jewish eschatology}}
Orthodox Judaism now includes opinions on eschatology which, in past centuries, were not mainstream views in Judaism. The prophecy of the coming of a Messiah is now central to Orthodox Judaism. According to this doctrine, a Messiah will arise from King David's lineage, and will bring with him signs such as the restoration of the Temple, peace, and universal acceptance of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=David|title=The Fragility of Religious Doctrine: Accounting for Orthodox Acquiescence in the Belief in a Second Coming|journal=Modern Judaism|date=2002|volume=22|issue=2|pages=103–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Messiah will embark on a quest to gather all Jews to the Holy Land, will proclaim prophethood, and will restore the Davidic Monarchy.

Classical Judaism did incorporate a tradition of belief in the [[resurrection of the dead]].&lt;ref name="Levenson2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jon Douglas Levenson

{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
For guidance in practical application of Jewish law, the majority of Orthodox Jews appeal to the [[Shulchan Aruch]] ("Code of Jewish Law" composed in the 16th century by Rabbi [[Joseph Karo]]), together with its surrounding commentaries. Thus, at a general level, there is a large degree of uniformity amongst all Orthodox Jews. Concerning the details, however, there is often variance: [[Posek|decisions]] may be based on various of the [[Halakha#Codes of Jewish law|standardized codes of Jewish Law]] that have been developed over the centuries, as well as on the various ''[[responsa]]''. These codes and responsa may differ from each other as regards detail (and reflecting the above philosophical differences, as regards the weight assigned to these). By and large, however, the differences result from the [[Diaspora|historic dispersal of the Jews]] and the consequent development of differences among regions in their practices (see [[minhag]]).

* [[Mizrahi]] and [[Sephardi]]c Orthodox Jews base their practice on the ''Shulchan Aruch''. The recent works of Halakha, ''[[Yaakov Chaim Sofer|Kaf HaChaim]]'', ''[[Ben Ish Chai]]'' and ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' are considered authoritative in many Sephardic communities. Thus, Mizrahi and Sephardi Jews may choose to follow the opinion of the ''[[Ben Ish Chai]]'' when it conflicts with the ''Shulchan Aruch''. Some of these practices are derived from the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] school of [[Isaac Luria]].
* [[Ashkenazi]]c Orthodox Jews have traditionally based most of their practices on the ''ReMA'', the [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]] on the ''Shulchan Aruch'' by Rabbi [[Moses Isserles]], reflecting differences between Ashkenazi and Sephardi custom. In the post-World War II period, the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'' has become authoritative. Ashkenazi Jews may choose to follow the ''[[Mishna Brurah]]'' instead of a particular detail of Jewish law as presented in the ''Shulchan Aruch''.
* [[Chabad]] [[Lubavitch]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] follows the rulings of [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] in the ''[[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]]''.
* Traditional [[Yemenite Jews#Religious groups|Baladi]] and [[Dor Daim]] ([[Yemenite Jews]]) base most of their practices on the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', the compendium by [[Maimonides]] of halakha, written several centuries before the ''Shulchan Aruch''. The ''[[Dor Daim#Talmide ha-Rambam|Talmidei haRambam]]'' also keep Jewish law as codified in the ''Mishneh Torah''.
* A smaller number, such as the [[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] Jews, traditionally rule according to the ''[[Jerusalem Talmud]]'' over the ''[[Talmud Bavli|Babylonian Talmud]]''.
* [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] consider the Shulchan Aruch authoritatively, but differ from other Sephardim by making less allowance for more recent authorities, in particular customs based on the [[Kabbalah]]. Some customs are based on Maimonides or the ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]''.

Orthodox Judaism emphasizes practicing rules of ''[[kashrut]]'', [[Shabbat]], [[family purity]], and ''[[tefilah]]'' (daily prayer). Many Orthodox Jews can be identified by their manner of dress and family lifestyle. Orthodox men and women dress modestly by keeping most of their skin covered. Married women cover their hair, most commonly in the form of a scarf, also in the form of hats, [[Snood (headgear)|snoods]], berets, or, sometimes, wigs. Orthodox men wear a skullcap known as a ''kipa'', and often fringes called ''tzitzit''. Many men grow beards, and Haredi men wear black hats (with a ''kipa'' underneath) and suits. Modern Orthodox Jews are sometimes indistinguishable in their dress from those around them, although they too wear ''kipa''s and ''tzitzit''; additionally, on Shabbat, Modern Orthodox men wear suits (or at least a dress shirt) and dress pants, while women wear fancier dresses or blouses.

Along with these practices, Orthodox Jews practice the laws of ''[[negiah]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/shomer-negiah/|title=Shomer Negiah, the Prohibition on Touching - My Jewish Learning|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means touch. Orthodox men and women do not engage in physical contact with those of the opposite sex outside of their spouse, or immediate family members (such as parents, siblings, and children).

== History ==

===Roots of Orthodox Judaism===
The roots of Orthodox Judaism can be traced to the late 18th or early 19th century, when elements within [[German Jew]]ry sought to reform Jewish belief and practice in the early 19th century in response to the [[Age of Enlightenment]], [[Jewish Emancipation]], and ''[[Haskalah]]''. The [[Haskalah]] movement sought to modernize education in light of contemporary scholarship. They rejected claims of the absolute divine authorship of the Torah, declaring only biblical laws concerning ethics to be binding, and stated that the rest of ''halakha'' (Jewish law) need not be viewed as normative for Jews in wider society. (see [[Reform Judaism]]).
&lt;!-- [[File:Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch.png|thumb|upright=0.7|Rabbi S.R. Hirsch]] --&gt;
In reaction to the emergence of Reform Judaism, a group of traditionalist German Jews emerged in support of some of the values of the [[Haskalah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Orthodoxy |title=YIVO &amp;#124; Orthodoxy |publisher=Yivoencyclopedia.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also wanted to defend the classic, traditional interpretation of Jewish law and tradition. This group was led by those who opposed the establishment of a new temple in [[Hamburg]] [1819], as reflected in the booklet "Ele Divrei HaBerit". As a group of Reform Rabbis convened in [[Braunschweig]], Rabbi [[Jacob Ettlinger]] of Altona published a manifesto entitled "Shlomei Emunei Yisrael" in [[German language|German]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], having 177 Rabbis sign on. At this time, the first Orthodox Jewish periodical, "Der Treue Zions Waechter", was launched with the Hebrew supplement "Shomer Zion HaNe'eman" [1845 - 1855]. In later years, it was Rav Ettlinger's students Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] and Rabbi [[Azriel Hildesheimer]] of Berlin who deepened the awareness and strength of Orthodox Jewry. Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch commented in 1854:&lt;blockquote&gt;It was not the "Orthodox" Jews who introduced the word "Orthodoxy" into Jewish discussion. It was the modern "progressive" Jews who first applied this name to "old", "backward" Jews as a derogatory term. This name was at first resented by "old" Jews. And rightly so. "Orthodox" Judaism does not know any varieties of Judaism. It conceives Judaism as one and indivisible. It does not know a Mosaic, prophetic, and rabbinic Judaism, nor Orthodox and Liberal Judaism. It only knows Judaism and non-Judaism. It does not know Orthodox and Liberal Jews. It does indeed know conscientious and indifferent Jews, good Jews, bad Jews, or baptized Jews; all, nevertheless, Jews with a mission which they cannot cast off. They are only distinguished accordingly as they fulfill or reject their mission. (Samson Raphael Hirsch, Religion Allied to Progress, in JMW. p. 198)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Dan |last=Cohn-Sherbok |title=Judaism: History, Belief, and Practice |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |page=264 |isbn=978-0415236607 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Hirsch held the opinion that Judaism demands an application of Torah thought to the entire realm of human experience, including the secular disciplines. His approach was termed the ''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]'' approach, or "neo-Orthodoxy". While insisting on strict adherence to Jewish beliefs and practices, he held that Jews should attempt to engage and influence the modern world, and encouraged those secular studies compatible with Torah thought. This pattern of religious and secular involvement has been evident at many times in Jewish history. Scholars{{who|date=October 2010}} believe it was characteristic of the Jews in [[Babylon]] during the [[Amoraim|Amoraic]] and [[Geonim|Geonic]] periods, and likewise in early [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|medieval Spain]], shown by their engagement with both Muslim and Christian society. It appeared as the traditional response to cultural and scientific innovation.

Traditionalist and reformist Jews in the middle of the nineteenth century had a consensus that the "Orthodox" label was inappropriate. Reformists even referred to the Orthodox as "''der so genannte Orthodoxen''" ("the so-called Orthodox"). The traditionalists blamed the reformists for causing this label to come about by drawing a distinction between themselves and those Jews who adhered to the old ways.&lt;ref name="JB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blutinger|first1=Jeffrey|title="'So-Called Orthodoxy': The History of an Unwanted Label".|journal=Modern Judaism|date=2007|volume=27|issue=3|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars believe that [[Modern Orthodoxy]] arose from the religious and social realities of [[Western Europe]]an Jewry. While non-Orthodox Jews consider Modern Orthodoxy traditional today, some (the Haredi/Hasidic groups) within the Orthodox community consider some elements to be of questionable validity. The neo-Orthodox movement holds that Hirsch's views are not accurately followed by Modern Orthodoxy. [See [[Torah im Derech Eretz]] and [[Torah Umadda]] "Relationship with Torah im Derech Eretz" for a more extensive listing.]

===Development of Orthodox religious practice===
[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Jewish Encyclopedia e9 327-0.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'', published in 1565, is the authoritative legal code for Orthodox Jews]]
Contemporary Orthodox Jews believe that they adhere to the same basic philosophy and legal framework that has existed throughout [[Jewish history]], whereas the other denominations depart from it. Orthodox Judaism, as it exists today, is an outgrowth that claims to extend from the time of Moses, to the time of the ''Mishnah'' and Talmud, through the development of [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|oral law]] and [[rabbinic literature]], until the present time. For some, Orthodox Judaism has been seen as a continuation of what was the mainstream expression of Judaism prior to the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Auerbach1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Auerbach|title=Encyclopedia of Multiculturalism: Daniel Ken Inouye-Mythology, American Indian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H9spAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 May 2013|year=1994|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-1-85435-674-1|page=976|quote=Until the French Revolution, all Jews would probably have been regarded as Orthodox, but in modern times, Orthodoxy has developed a self-conscious ideology that, for some, distinguishes it from historical or traditional Judaism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Orthodox claim to absolute fidelity to past tradition has been challenged by modern scholars who contend that the Judaism of the Middle Ages bore little resemblance to that practiced by today's Orthodox. Rather, the Orthodox community, as a counterreaction to the liberalism of the [[Haskalah]] movement, began to embrace far more stringent halachic practices than their predecessors, most notably in matters of [[Kashrut]] and [[Passover]] dietary laws, where the strictest possible interpretation becomes a religious requirement, even where the Talmud explicitly prefers a more lenient position, and even where a more lenient position was practiced by prior generations.&lt;ref name=Kraemer&gt;{{cite book|last=Kraemer|first=David C.|title=Jewish Eating and Identity Through the Ages|year=2007|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780203941577|pages=151–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steinberg&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Paul|title=Celebrating the Jewish Year: The Spring and Summer Holidays: Passover, The Omer, Shavuot, Tisha B'Av|year=2009|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|isbn=9780827608504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish historians also note that certain customs of today's Orthodox are not continuations of past practice, but instead represent innovations that would have been unknown to prior generations. For example, the now-widespread ''Haredi'' tradition of cutting a boy's hair for the first time on his third birthday (''[[upshirin]]'' or ''upsheerin'', [[Yiddish]] for "haircut") "originated as an Arab custom that parents cut a newborn boy's hair and burned it in a fire as a sacrifice", and "Jews in Palestine learned this custom from Arabs and adapted it to a special Jewish context".&lt;ref name="Marcus"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fine|first1=Lawrence |title=Judaism in Practice: From the Middle Ages Through the Early Modern Period|year=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691057873|pages=117–119|author2=Ivan G. Marcus|authorlink=Honey Cakes and Torah}} The tradition of lighting bonfires on ''Lag B'omer'' also derives from the same Arab practice of burning the child's cut hair, as it was initially on that day (rather than on the third birthday) that the cutting ceremony was performed.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ashkenazi]] prohibition against eating ''[[kitniyot]]'' (grains and legumes such as rice, corn, beans, and peanuts) during Passover was explicitly rejected in the Talmud,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} has no known precedent before the 12th century, and represented a minority position for hundreds of years thereafter, but nonetheless has remained a mandatory prohibition among Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews due to their historic adherence to [[Moses Isserles|ReMA]]'s rulings in the [[Shulchan Aruch]].&lt;ref&gt;Orach Haim 453:1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth of Orthodox affiliation===
In practice, the emphasis on strictness has resulted in the rise of "homogeneous enclaves" with other Haredi Jews that are less likely to be threatened by assimilation and intermarriage, or even to interact with other Jews who do not share their doctrines.&lt;ref name=Linker&gt;{{cite book|last=Linker|first=Damon|title=The Religious Test|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=9780393080551|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, this strategy has proved successful, and the number of adherents to Orthodox Judaism, including Haredi and Hasidic communities, has grown rapidly.&lt;ref name=Linker /&gt;

In 1915, Yeshiva College (later [[Yeshiva University]]) and its [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] was established in [[New York City]] for training in an Orthodox milieu. A school branch was established in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], California.

A number of other influential Orthodox seminaries, many of them Haredi, were established throughout the country, most notably in New York; [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], Maryland; and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], Illinois. [[Beth Medrash Govoha]], the Haredi yeshiva in [[Lakewood, New Jersey]], is the largest Talmudic academy in the United States, with a student body of over 5,000 students.

== Organization and demographics ==
[[File:Reb Moshe Feinstein.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], a leading 20th-century American Orthodox authority.]]
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Orthodox Judaism is heterogeneous, whereby subgroups maintain significant social differences, and less significant differences in understanding Halakha. What unifies various groups under the "Orthodox" umbrella is the central belief that Torah, including the Oral Law, was given directly from [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] to Moses at [[Mount Sinai]] and applies in all times and places. As a result, all Orthodox Jews are required to live in accordance with the [[mitzvah|Commandments]] and [[Halakha|Jewish law]].

Since there is no one Orthodox body, there is no one canonical statement of principles. Rather, each Orthodox group claims to be a non-exclusive heir to the received tradition of Jewish theology. Many groups have affirmed a literal acceptance of [[Maimonides]]' [[13 Principles of Faith|thirteen principles]].

Given this (relative) philosophic flexibility, variant viewpoints are possible, particularly in areas not explicitly demarcated by the Halakha. The result is a relatively broad range of ''hashqafoth'' (Sing. ''[[hashkafa]]'' {{lang-he|השקפה}} – [[world view]], Weltanschauung) within Orthodoxy. The greatest differences within strains of Orthodoxy involve the following issues:

* the degree to which an Orthodox Jew should integrate or disengage from [[secularism|secular society]]
* based, in part, on varying interpretations of the [[Three Oaths]], whether [[Zionism]] is part of Judaism or opposed to it, and defining the role of the modern State of Israel in Judaism
* their spiritual approach to Torah, such as the relative roles of mainstream Talmudic study and [[Hasidic philosophy|mysticism]] or [[Mussar movement|ethics]]
* the validity of secular knowledge, including critical Jewish scholarship of [[Rabbinic literature]] and [[Jewish philosophy|modern philosophical]] ideas
* whether [[Torah im Derech Eretz#Earning a livelihood|the Talmudic obligation to learn while ''also'' practicing a trade/profession]] applies in our times
* the centrality of [[yeshiva]]s as the place for personal Torah study
* the validity of authoritative spiritual guidance in areas outside of Halakhic decision ([[Da'as Torah]])
* the importance of maintaining non-Halakhic [[Minhag|customs]], such as dress, language, and music
* the [[Role of women in Judaism#Orthodox Judaism|role of women]] in (religious) society
* the nature of the relationship with non-Jews

Based on their philosophy and doctrine vis-a-vis these core issues, adherents to Orthodoxy can roughly be divided into the subgroups of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Haredi Judaism]], with [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jewish]] groups falling into the latter category.

===Modern Orthodoxy===
{{main|Modern Orthodox Judaism}}
In general, Modern Orthodoxy's "overall approach ... is the belief that one can and should be a full member of modern society, accepting the risks to remaining observant, because the benefits outweigh those risks".&lt;ref name="HelmreichShinnar"&gt;William B. Helmreich and Reuel Shinnar: [http://www.jcpa.org/cjc/jl-383-helmreich.htm Modern Orthodoxy in America: Possibilities for a Movement under Siege]&lt;/ref&gt; Jews should engage constructively with the world that they are in to [[tikkun olam|foster goodness and justice]] within both themselves and the larger community, such as by avoiding [[sin]] in their personal lives while also [[Tzedakah|caring for the unfortunate]].

Thus, Modern Orthodoxy holds that [[halakha|Jewish law]] is [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] and binding, while simultaneously attaching a positive value to interaction with the modern world. In this view, as expressed by Rabbi [[Saul Berman]],&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Saul J. Berman, [http://www.shma.com/2001/02/the-ideology-of-modern-orthodoxy/ The Ideology of Modern Orthodoxy]&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox Judaism can "be enriched" by its intersection with modernity; further, "modern society creates opportunities to be productive citizens engaged in the Divine work of [[tikkun olam|transforming the world to benefit humanity]]". At the same time, in order to preserve the integrity of [[halakha]], any area of "powerful inconsistency and conflict" between Torah and modern culture must be filtered out.&lt;ref&gt;This includes Modern Orthodox's unequivocal stance prohibiting its members from engaging in gay and Lesbian relationships. There is, however, a difference of opinion as to what stance to take with individuals who violate [[halakha]] in this regard. See {{cite web |url= http://statementofprinciplesnya.blogspot.co.il/ |title= Statement of principles of the orthodox rabbis |accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Orthodoxy also assigns a central role to the "People of Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/document.cfm?title=Some+Comments+on+Centrist+Orthodoxy&amp;hyperlink=lamm21.html&amp;type=Document&amp;category=Orthodoxy+and+Modernity&amp;authortitle=Rabbi+Dr&amp;firstname=Norman&amp;lastname=Lamm&amp;pubsource=Tradition,+22:3&amp;authorid=285|title=Here is your document: Some Comments on Centrist Orthodoxy|website=www.edah.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here two characteristics are manifest: In general, Modern Orthodoxy places a high [[nationalism|national]], as well as religious, significance on the [[State of Israel]], and institutions and individuals are, typically, [[Zionist]] in orientation; relatedly, involvement with non-Orthodox Jews will extend beyond "[[Baal teshuva#Orthodox outreach organizations|outreach]]" to include institutional relations and cooperation.

Other "core beliefs" &lt;ref name="HelmreichShinnar"/&gt; are a recognition of the value and importance of secular studies (see [[Torah Umadda#Torah and secular knowledge|Torah Umadda:Torah and secular knowledge]]), a commitment to equality of education for both men and women, and a full acceptance of the importance of being able to financially support oneself and one's family.

===Haredi Judaism===
[[Haredi Judaism]] is a broad spectrum of groups within Orthodox Judaism, all characterized by a rejection of modern [[secularism|secular]] culture. Its members are often referred to as "strictly Orthodox" or "ultra-Orthodox" in English, although the term "ultra-Orthodox" is considered pejorative by many of its adherents.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/should-ultra-orthodox-jews-be-able-to-decide-what-theyre-called/2014/02/06/99c2a506-8f74-11e3-878e-d76656564a01_story.html|title=Should ultra-Orthodox Jews be able to decide what they're called? |last=Markoe |first=Lauren |date=February 6, 2014|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haredim regard themselves as the most religiously authentic group of Jews,&lt;ref name="DumovaFiordo2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tatyana Dumova|author2=Richard Fiordo|title=Blogging in the Global Society: Cultural, Political and Geographical Aspects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TBQqS-bFBUYC&amp;pg=PA126|date=30 September 2011|publisher=Idea Group Inc (IGI)|isbn=978-1-60960-744-9|page=126|quote=Haredim regard themselves as the most authentic custodians of Jewish religious law and tradition which, in their opinion, is binding and unchangeable. They consider all other expressions of Judaism, including Modern Orthodoxy, as deviations from God's laws.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this claim is contested by other streams.&lt;ref name="Rubel2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nora L. Rubel|title=Doubting the Devout: The Ultra-Orthodox in the Jewish American Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NR2lyBRvt9QC&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=24 July 2013|year=2010|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14187-1|page=148|quote=Mainstream Jews have—until recently—maintained the impression that the ultraorthodox are the 'real' Jews.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ilan|2012}}: "One of the main sources of power enabling Haredi Jews' extreme behavior is the Israeli public's widely held view that their way of life represents traditional Judaism, and that when it comes to Judaism, more radical means more authentic. This is among the most strongly held and unfounded myths in Israel society."&lt;/ref&gt;

Haredi Judaism is a reaction to societal changes, including emancipation, enlightenment, the ''[[Haskalah]]'' movement derived from enlightenment, acculturation, secularization, religious reform in all its forms from mild to extreme, the rise of the [[Zionism|Jewish national movements]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;For example: Arnold Eisen, ''Rethinking Modern Judaism'', University of Chicago Press, 1998. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Modern Orthodox Judaism, which hastened to embrace [[modernity]], the approach of the Haredim was to maintain a steadfast adherence both to [[halakah|Jewish Law]] and custom by segregating themselves from modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Batnitzky|2011|pp=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many Haredi communities in which getting a professional degree or establishing a business is encouraged, and contact exists between Haredi and non-Haredi Jews, as well as between Haredim and non-Jews.&lt;ref name="LIDMAN"&gt;{{cite web |last1=LIDMAN |first1=MELANIE |title=As ultra-Orthodox women bring home the bacon, don’t say the F-word |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-ultra-orthodox-women-bring-home-the-bacon-dont-say-the-f-word/ |accessdate=26 November 2018 |date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wertheimer"/&gt;

Haredi communities are primarily found in [[Israel]], [[North America]], and [[Western Europe]].

===Hasidic Judaism===
[[File:Rabbi Schneerson - Lag BaOmer parade.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Lag BaOmer]] parade in front of Chabad headquarters at [[770 Eastern Parkway]], [[Brooklyn]], New York, in 1987]]
[[Hasidic Judaism]], or ''Chasidism'', arose as a spiritual revival movement in contemporary [[Western Ukraine]] during the 18th century, and spread rapidly throughout [[Eastern Europe]]. Today, most affiliates reside in the [[United States]], [[Israel]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Israel Ben Eliezer, the [[Baal Shem Tov]], is regarded as its founding father, and his disciples developed and disseminated it. Present-day Hasidism is a sub-group within Haredi Judaism, and is noted for its religious conservatism and social seclusion. Its members adhere closely both to Orthodox Jewish practice – with the movement's own unique emphases – and the traditions of Eastern European Jews, so much so that many of the latter, including various special styles of dress and the use of the [[Yiddish language]], are nowadays associated almost exclusively with Hasidism.

Hasidic thought draws heavily on [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], and, to an extent, is a popularization of it. Teachings emphasize God's [[immanence]] in the universe, the need to cleave and be one with Him at all times, the devotional aspect of religious practice, and the spiritual dimension of corporeality and mundane acts. ''Hasidim'', the adherents of Hasidism, are organized in [[Hasidic dynasty|independent sects known as "courts" or dynasties]], each headed by its own hereditary leader, a ''[[Rebbe]]''. Reverence and submission to the ''Rebbe'' are key tenets, as he is considered a spiritual authority with whom the follower must bond to gain closeness to God. The various "courts" share basic convictions, but operate apart, and possess unique traits and customs. Affiliation is often retained in families for generations, and being Hasidic is as much a sociological factor – entailing, as it does, birth into a specific community and allegiance to a dynasty of ''Rebbe''s – as it is a purely religious one. There are several "courts" with many thousands of member households each, and hundreds of smaller ones. The total number of Hasidim, both adults and children, is estimated to be above 400,000.

=== Demographics ===
As of 2001, Orthodox Jews and Jews affiliated with an Orthodox synagogue accounted for approximately 50% of [[British Jews]] (150,000), 27% of [[Israeli Jews]] (1,500,000),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.528994 Poll: 7.1 percent of Israeli Jews define themselves as Reform or Conservative] Haaretz, 11 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and 13% of [[American Jews]] (529,000). Among those affiliated to a synagogue body, Orthodox Jews represent 70% of British Jewry,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpr.org.uk/downloads/Synagogue%20membership.pdf Synagogue membership in the United Kingdom in 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/60Mnkiz1A?url=http://www.jpr.org.uk/downloads/Synagogue%20membership.pdf|date=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 27% of American Jewry.&lt;ref name="AJRD"&gt;[http://www.jewishfederations.org/local_includes/downloads/7579.pdf American Jewish Religious Denominations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118200821/http://www.jewishfederations.org/local_includes/downloads/7579.pdf|date=2012-01-18}}, United Jewish Communities Report Series on the National Jewish Population Survey 2001-01, (Table 2, pg. 9)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:בניין המשרדים 788-784 (2).jpg|thumb|left|The [[New York City Metropolitan Area]] is home to the largest American Orthodox Jewish population. Seen here is [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] in [[Brooklyn]].]]
In 1880, the number of members of the American Jewry was 250,000. Their numbers swelled with European Jewish migration in the closing decades of the 19th century and opening decades of the 20th century to 3.5 million by 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zev Eleff|title=Modern Orthodox Judaism: A Documentary History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=osksDAAAQBAJ|date=July 2016|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8276-1291-4|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; This migration was discouraged by several Rabbis, stating that the American environment was not conducive to Jewish observance, an observation many Jews agreed with, but only after settling in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zev Eleff|title=Modern Orthodox Judaism: A Documentary History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=osksDAAAQBAJ|date=July 2016|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8276-1291-4|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sizable Orthodox Jewish communities are located throughout the United States, the highest number of American Orthodox Jews live in [[New York (state)|New York]] State, particularly in the [[New York City Metropolitan Area]]. Two of the main Orthodox communities in the United States are located in [[New York City]] and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. In New York City, the neighborhoods of [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]], Midwood, [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], and [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]], located in the [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Brooklyn]], have particularly large Orthodox communities. The most rapidly growing community of American Orthodox Jews is located in Rockland County and the [[Hudson Valley]] of New York, including the communities of [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]], [[Monroe (village), New York|Monroe]], [[New Square, New York|New Square]], [[Kiryas Joel, New York|Kiryas Joel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimesus.com/neighbors-riled-as-insular-hasidic-village-seeks-to-expand/|title=Neighbors riled as insular Hasidic village seeks to expand|newspaper=The Korea Times|date=February 27, 2017|accessdate=March 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ramapo Town, New York|Ramapo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/longform/news/local/rockland/ramapo/2017/01/08/ramapo-ny-breaking-point/95369994/|title=Ramapo nears breaking point|author=Jonathan Bandler, Steve Lieberman, and Richard Liebson|publisher=NorthJersey.com, part of the USA TODAY network|date=January 9, 2016|accessdate=January 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also sizable and rapidly growing Orthodox communities throughout [[New Jersey]], particularly in [[Lakewood, New Jersey|Lakewood]], [[Jackson Township, New Jersey|Jackson Township]], [[Freehold Township, New Jersey|Freehold]], [[Manalapan Township|Manalapan]],&lt;ref name=ManalapanOrthodoxJewish&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishlinknj.com/community-news/bergen/20261-manalapan-a-welcoming-jewish-community-in-the-heart-of-new-jersey|title=Manalapan: A Welcoming Jewish Community in the Heart of New Jersey|author=Jill Kirsch|publisher=Jewish Link of New Jersey|date=August 17, 2017|accessdate=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Teaneck, New Jersey|Teaneck]], [[Englewood, New Jersey|Englewood]], [[Passaic, New Jersey|Passaic]], and [[Fair Lawn, New Jersey|Fair Lawn]]. Growth in the Orthodox Jewish population in Lakewood has driven overall population growth, making it the fastest growing town by absolute numerical increase in New Jersey between roughly 2008 and 2012; Lakewood's population grew from 70,046 to 96,575, an increase of 26,529 over that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2017/03/the_20_fastest_growing_towns_in_nj.html#incart_m-rpt-2|title=The 20 fastest growing towns in New Jersey|author=Stephen Sirlling|publisher=NJ Advance Media for NJ.com|date=March 1, 2017|accessdate=March 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[Maryland]] has a large number of Orthodox Jews, many of whom live in [[Baltimore]], particularly in the [[Park Heights, Baltimore|Park Heights]], [[Mount Washington, Baltimore|Mount Washington]], and [[Pikesville, Maryland|Pikesville]] areas. Two other large Orthodox Jewish centers are southern [[Florida]], particularly [[Miami Beach]], and the [[Los Angeles]] area of [[California]].

In contrast to the liberal American Jewish community, which is dwindling due to low [[fertility rate|fertility]] and high [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|intermarriage]] and assimilation rates, the Orthodox Jewish community of the United States is growing rapidly. Among Orthodox Jews, the [[fertility rate]] stands at about 4.1 children per family, as compared to 1.9 children per family among non-Orthodox Jews, and intermarriage among Orthodox Jews is practically non-existent, standing at about 2%, in contrast to a 71% intermarriage rate among non-Orthodox Jews. In addition, Orthodox Judaism has a growing retention rate; while about half of those raised in Orthodox homes previously abandoned Orthodox Judaism, that number is declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2013/10/01/news-opinion/united-states/pew-survey-u-s-jewish-intermarriage-rate-rises-to-58-percent|title=Pew survey of U.S. Jews: soaring intermarriage, assimilation rates|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/17/eight-facts-about-orthodox-jews-from-the-pew-research-survey/|title=Eight facts about Orthodox Jews from the Pew Research survey|date=17 October 2013|work=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the high growth rate of Orthodox Jews will eventually render them the dominant demographic force in New York - and American - Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/opinion/brooks-the-orthodox-surge.html?_r=0|title=The Orthodox Surge|author=David Brooks|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 7, 2013|accessdate=March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Orthodox Jews subscribing to [[Modern Orthodoxy]] in its American and UK incarnations, tend to follow far more [[right-wing politics]] than both non-Orthodox and other Orthodox Jews. While the majority of non-Orthodox American Jews are on average strongly [[liberalism|liberal]] and supporters of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], the Modern Orthodox subgroup of Orthodox Judaism tends to be far more conservative, with roughly half describing themselves as political conservatives, and are mostly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/chapter-6-social-and-political-views/|title=Jewish American's Social and Political Views - Pew Research Center|date=1 October 2013|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Orthodox Jews, compared to both the non-Orthodox American Jewry and the Haredi and Hasidic Jewry, also tend to have a stronger connection to Israel due to their attachment to Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/chapter-5-connection-with-and-attitudes-towards-israel/#attachment-to-israel|title=Jewish Americans' Connection With and Attitudes Toward Israel - Pew Research Center|date=1 October 2013|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Movements, organizations, and groups ===
[[File:Jerusalem Great Synagogue05.jpg|thumb|[[Heichal Shlomo]], former seat of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] in Jerusalem.]]
* [[Agudath Israel of America]] is the largest and most influential Haredi organization in America. Its roots go back to the establishment of the original founding of the Agudath Israel movement in 1912 in Katowitz, [[Prussia]] (now [[Katowice]], [[Poland]]). The American Agudath Israel was founded in 1939. There is an [[Agudat Israel]] (Hasidic) in Israel, and also [[Degel HaTorah]] (non-Hasidic "[[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]]"), as well as an Agudath Israel of Europe. These groups are loosely affiliated through the [[World Agudath Israel]], which from time to time holds a major gathering in Israel called a ''knessia''. Agudah unites many rabbinic leaders from the Hasidic Judaism wing with those of the non-Hasidic "yeshiva" world. It is generally non-nationalistic, and more or less ambivalent towards the modern [[State of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Aguddah.html|title=The "Aguddat Israel" Movement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, known as the [[Orthodox Union]], or "OU", and the [[Rabbinical Council of America]], "RCA", are organizations that represent Modern Orthodox Judaism, a large segment of Orthodoxy in the United States and Canada. These groups should not be confused with the similarly named [[Union of Orthodox Rabbis]] (described below).
* The [[National Council of Young Israel]] (NCYI) and the [[Council of Young Israel Rabbis]] (CYIR) are smaller groups that were founded as Modern Orthodox organizations, are Zionistic, and are in the right wing of Modern Orthodox Judaism. Young Israel strongly supports, and allies itself with, the settlement movement in Israel. While the lay membership of synagogues affiliated with the NCYI are almost exclusively Modern Orthodox in orientation, the rabbinical leadership of the synagogues ranges from Modern Orthodox to Haredi.
* The [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israel-mfa.gov.il/gov/relaffs.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125033058/http://www.israel-mfa.gov.il/gov/relaffs.html |date=January 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded with the intention of representing all of Judaism within the State of Israel, and has two chief rabbis: One is Ashkenazic (of the East European and Russian Jewish tradition), and one is Sephardic (of the Mediterranean, North African, [[Central Asia]]n, Middle-Eastern, and of [[Caucasus]] Jewish tradition.) The rabbinate has never been accepted by most Israeli Haredi groups. Since the 1960s, the Chief rabbinate of Israel has moved somewhat closer to the positions of Haredi Judaism.
* [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]], and political parties such as [[Mafdal]] and [[National Union (Israel)]] all represent certain sectors within the [[Religious Zionist]] movement, both in Israel and the diaspora. The defunct&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica: Volume 8, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gush Emunim]], [[Meimad]], [[Tzohar (organization)|Tzohar]], [[Hazit]], and other movements represent over competing divisions within the sector. They firmly believe in the "Land Of Israel for the People of Israel according to the Torah of Israel" principle, although the left-wing Religious Zionist [[Meimad]] party is more pragmatic about such program. [[Gush Emunim]] are the settlement wing of [[National Union (Israel)]], and support widespread kiruv as well, through such institutions as [[Machon Meir]] and [[Merkaz HaRav]], and individuals like Rabbi [[Shlomo Aviner]]. Another sector includes the [[Hardal]] faction, which tends to be unallied to the Government and quite centristic.
* [[Chabad Lubavitch]] is a branch of Hasidic Judaism widely known for its emphasis on [[Orthodox Jewish outreach|outreach]] and education. The organization has been in existence for 200 years, and especially after the [[Second World War]], it began sending out emissaries (''[[Shaliach (Chabad)|shluchim]]'') who have as a mission the bringing back of disaffected Jews to a level of observance consistent with Chabad norms (i. e., Orthodox Judaism, [[Hasidic philosophy#Schools of thought|Chassidus]], [[Chabad messianism]],&lt;ref name="sacks"&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Hasidism'', entry: Habad, Jonathan Sacks, pp. 161–164&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tanya]]). They are major participants in what is known as the ''[[Baal teshuva|Baal Teshuva]]'' movement. Their mandate is to introduce Chabad philosophy to non-observant Jews, and to make them more observant as [[Beinoni]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wertheimer|first1=Jack|title=Why the Lubavitch Movement Thrives in the Absence of a Living Rebbe|url=http://www.ou.org/jewish_action/06/2014/lubavitch-movement-thrives-absence-living-rebbe/|accessdate=30 September 2014|work=JA Mag in Jewish World|agency=Orthodox Union|date=June 16, 2014|quote=Among the latter is the Jewish Learning Institute, the largest educational program for Jewish adults in the world (with the possible exception of the Daf Yomi enterprise), which currently enrolls over 66,000 teens and adults at some 850 sites around the world, each following a prescribed course of study according to a set timetable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web name=Wertheimer|last=Wertheimer|first=Jack|title=The Outreach Revolution|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/the-outreach-revolution/|publisher=Commentary Magazine|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chabad hosts Jewish perspectives on staying positive|url=http://newjerseyhills.com/hanover_eagle/news/chabad-hosts-jewish-perspectives-on-staying-positive/article_593e3277-7566-5bce-afd1-4d931ee0e270.html|accessdate=3 November 2014|agency=Hanover Eagle|publisher=New Jersey Hills Media Group, Bernardsville, NJ|date=October 30, 2014|quote="How Happiness Thinks" was created by the [[Rohr Jewish Learning Institute]]- an internationally acclaimed adult education program running on over 350 cities worldwide, which boast over 75,000 students.

This is due in part to the existence of the "non-Orthodox Hasidim" (of which include former Israeli President [[Zalman Shazar]]), the lack of official recognition of political and religious distinctions within Judaism, and the open relationship with non-Orthodox Jews represented by the activism of Chabad emissaries.&lt;ref name=chabadquestion1&gt;Liebman, Charles S.

Ambivalent Jew—Charles S. Liebman in memoriam, ed. Stuart Cohen and Bernard Susser (2007): 107-124.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Rohr Jewish Learning Institute]] is a provider of adult Jewish courses on Jewish history, law, ethics, philosophy, and rabbinical literature. It also develops Jewish studies curricula specifically for women, college students, teenagers, and seniors. In 2014, there were 117,500 people enrolled in JLI, making it the largest Jewish education network in the world.
* In Israel, although it shares a similar agenda with the Sephardic [[Shas]] political party, Shas is more bi-partisan when it comes to its own issues, and non-nationalistic-based, with a huge emphasis on [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] Judaism.
* The Agudath HaRabbonim, also known as the [[Union of Orthodox Rabbis]] of the United States and Canada, is a small Haredi-leaning organization founded in 1902. It should not be confused with "The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America" (see above), which is a separate organization. While at one time influential within Orthodox Judaism, the Agudath HaRabbonim in the last several decades has progressively moved further to the right; its membership has been dropping, and it has been relatively inactive. Some of its members are rabbis from Chabad Lubavitch; some are also members of the RCA (see above). It is currently most famous for its 1997 declaration (citing Israeli Chief Rabbi [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]] and Orthodox Rabbi [[Joseph Soloveitchik]]) that the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] movements are "not Judaism at all".
* The [[Central Rabbinical Congress of the United States and Canada]] (CRC) was established in 1952. It is an [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]], Haredi organization, closely aligned with the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Hasidic group, which has about 100,000 adherents (an unknown number of which are rabbis), and like-minded Haredi groups.
* The left-wing Modern Orthodox advocacy group, [[Edah]], formed from United States Modern Orthodox rabbis. Most of its membership came from synagogues affiliated with the Union of Orthodox Congregations and RCA (above). Their motto was, "The courage to be Modern and Orthodox". Edah ceased operations in 2007, and merged some of its programs into the left-wing [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]].
* The [[Beis Yaakov]] educational movement, begun in 1917, introduced the concept of formal Judaic schooling for Orthodox women.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17145">The '''Pei Plan''' was an [[urban redevelopment]] initiative designed for downtown [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], United States, in the 1960s and 1970s.  It is the informal name for two related commissions of noted architect and urban planner [[I. M. Pei]] &amp;ndash; namely the '''Central Business District General Neighborhood Renewal Plan''' (design completed 1964) and the '''Central Business District Project I-A Development Plan''' (design completed 1966).  It was formally adopted in 1965, and implemented in public and private phases throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

The plan called for the demolition of hundreds of antiquated downtown structures&lt;ref name=newsok/&gt; in favor of renewed parking, office building, and retail developments, in addition to public projects such as the [[Myriad Convention Center]] and the [[Myriad Botanical Gardens]].  It was the dominant template for downtown development in Oklahoma City from its inception through the 1970s, supported by [[Mayor of Oklahoma City|Oklahoma City Mayor]] [[Patience Latting]].&lt;ref name=newsok&gt;{{cite news|first=Bryan|last=Dean|title=Former Oklahoma City Mayor Patience Latting dies at age 94 |url=http://newsok.com/former-oklahoma-city-mayor-patience-latting-dies-at-age-94/article/3741834 |work=[[The Oklahoman]]  |publisher= |date=2012-12-28 |accessdate=2013-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan generated mixed results and opinion, largely succeeding in re-developing office building and parking infrastructure but failing to attract its anticipated retail and residential development.  Public resentment also developed as a result of the destruction of multiple historic structures.  As a result, Oklahoma City's leadership avoided large-scale urban planning for downtown throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, until the passage of the [[Metropolitan Area Projects]] (MAPS) initiative in 1993.

==Impetus for the plan &amp;ndash; 1950s and 1960s==
Similar to most urban areas in the post-World War II era, Oklahoma City experienced [[urban sprawl]] into outlying municipal and suburban areas in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4182/is_20070731/ai_n19440127/ |publisher=The Journal Record |title=The Century Club: George H. Shirk |accessdate=2009-10-20 | first=Marcia | last=Shottenkirk | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At the same time, increased automobile traffic exhausted the limited parking availability in the Oklahoma City downtown area, a phenomenon which was exacerbated by the dismantling of the Oklahoma City Railway after World War II.&lt;ref name=Lackp6&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, real estate lots downtown &amp;ndash; a holdover from the days of the [[Land Run of 1889]] that settled the area &amp;ndash; were too small to accommodate expanding business sizes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1962, 53 downtown retailers had closed or moved to the suburbs.&lt;ref name="Lackp6"/&gt;

During the 1950s and early 1960s local Oklahoma City business leaders, including Dean A. McGee, Chamber of Commerce president Stanley Draper, and publisher [[E.K. Gaylord]] laid the groundwork for local and state laws authorizing land acquisitions for urban renewal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], pp. 7&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1962, the city council had authorized the creation of an Urban Renewal Authority, which received initial funding from local business leaders that hired architect I.M. Pei to design a comprehensive redevelopment proposal.&lt;ref name=Lackp13&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, I.M. Pei had received international recognition for urban redesign plans for [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and [[Philadelphia]], among others.&lt;ref name="Lackp13"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcf-p.com/a/f/fme/imp/p/p.html |publisher=Pei, Cobb, Freed &amp; Partners |title=Project List |accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original plan==
[[File:Pei plan galleria.jpg|thumb|alt=Colorful architectural rendering of a multi-level glass structure with a walkway connecting to a park|The Pei Plan's original rendering of the Myriad Gardens (right) connecting via elevated walkway to a Galleria shopping center (left)]]

I.M. Pei developed his plan for the {{convert|528|acre|km2|adj=on}} Central Business District through 1964, initially disclosing it only to Urban Renewal Authority principals and principals of the related but privately financed Urban Action Foundation.&lt;ref name=Lackp13/&gt; Pei's plan called for the demolition of hundreds of buildings to form "superblocks" that could house large-scale development.  Included in the plan were new parking garages (increasing available spaces from the then-available 14,300 to 28,360), a new street grid converting Robinson, Reno, and Sheridan (formerly Grand) Avenue into one-way streets, a new convention center, planned spaces for adjoining hotel development, a major retail center, new residential and office towers, an [[Tivoli Gardens|Tivoli]]-style outdoor garden, and an arts district centered around a new "Mummer's Theater."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], pp. 14&amp;ndash;16.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the plan was ready for official city adoption, Oklahoma City Mayor Jack Wilkes had resigned to become President of [[Centenary College of Louisiana|Centenary College]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=Lackp17-19&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], pp. 17&amp;ndash;19.&lt;/ref&gt;  City Council members chose for his replacement local civic leader and historian [[George H. Shirk]], also a noted historic preservationist. Despite his preservationist tendencies, Shirk proved to be an enthusiastic supporter of the Pei Plan, and eventually cast the deciding vote in the city council to approve the plan in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=okc.govbio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.okc.gov/council/okcmayors/index.html#George_Shirk |title=OKC.gov Biography of George H.

==Plan implementation: 1965 &amp;ndash; 1980==
Implementation of the Pei Plan required a series of land acquisitions while replacement facilities and buildings were being built, and eventually grew to differ from Pei's original concept as landowners willingly sold properties to the Urban Renewal Authority, while other landowners targeted in the plan vigorously defended against [[eminent domain]] actions.&lt;ref name=Lackp32&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Pei's original plan had called for the retention of, among other notable Oklahoma City landmarks, the Biltmore and Huckins Hotels.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pei Plan Map highlighted.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Map of streetscape with areas highlighted in red|A map of the Pei Plan’s anticipated redevelopment work, with areas to be demolished highlighted in red, January 22, 1965.]] --&gt;

The original plan also envisioned replacement facilities for downtown's John A. Brown Department Store,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and the replacement of buildings along Main Street with an interior shopping arcade.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Pei's plan had not finalized a site for the proposed convention center, which after negotiations between competing areas of the city was eventually located in an area of southeast downtown generally regarded as "skid row," with funding ensured by a July 1968 special election.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], pp. 30, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Large-scale demolition began in 1967, funded with federal redevelopment grants provided under the [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1970s the redevelopment authority had constructed the new convention center, expanded and rerouted Broadway Avenue (now renamed E.K. Gaylord Avenue) in Oklahoma City as a six-lane commuter thoroughfare featuring the vast Santa Fe Parking Garage, and provided sites for new headquarters of the Kerr-McGee Corporation (now home to SandRidge Energy),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dougloudenback.com/downtown/okc60.htm |title=Kerr-McGee Center |accessdate=2009-10-21 |publisher=Dougloudenback.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberty Bank (now the [[Chase Tower (Oklahoma City)|Chase Tower]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dougloudenback.com/downtown/okc65.htm |accessdate=2009-10-21 |title=Chase Tower |publisher=Dougloudenback.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fidelity Bank (now the Park Harvey Center).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], pp. 30&amp;ndash;34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dougloudenback.com/downtown/okc56.htm |publisher=Dougloudenback.com |accessdate=2009-10-21 |title=Park Harvey Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pedestrian tunnel project originally designed to connect with the proposed Main Street shopping arcade was also constructed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Nixon administration, however, generous support of urban renewal effort began to dwindle.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hotel and retail developments originally envisioned as part of the Pei Plan began to disintegrate as retailers opted for shopping mall developments rather than downtown locations (the principal shopping malls in Oklahoma City included [[Penn Square Mall]], Shepherd Mall, [[Crossroads Mall (Oklahoma)|Crossroads Mall]], and later, [[Quail Springs Mall]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], pp. 38, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, department store company John A. Brown (which originally featured Oklahoma City-based ownership, but subsequently merged with the [[Dayton Hudson Corporation]] in 1971) announced plans to abandon its downtown location on January 30, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposed site for the Main Street arcade &amp;ndash; which was to have connected to both the underground pedestrian tunnel and the Myriad Gardens &amp;ndash; already largely demolished, was minimally redeveloped into a surface-level parking garage owned by public authorities.

With a dearth of retail opportunities downtown, residential developments envisioned in the Pei Plan failed to develop.  Later phases of reconstruction centered on public works projects rather than private redevelopment.  In 1977 the last major demolition was accomplished to make way for the [[Myriad Botanical Gardens]] west of the convention center.&lt;ref&gt;For a history of the Myriad Gardens project, ''see'' {{cite web |url=http://dougdawg.blogspot.com/2008/03/myriad-gardens.html |title=Myriad Gardens |publisher=Doug Dawgz Blog |accessdate=2009-10-21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  That year also saw the construction of the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] &amp;ndash; later the target of the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]] by [[Timothy McVeigh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dougloudenback.com/downtown/vintage/1977.htm#2 |publisher=Dougloudenback.com |accessdate=2009-10-21 |title=Alfred P. Murrah Building}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1980, little if any redevelopment activity remained.

==Public reaction==
[[File:Criterion Theater OKC 1929.jpg|thumb|alt=Tall building with a marquee featuring production of "Dance of Life".|upright|right|The Criterion Theater in 1929, one of the more significant historical buildings lost to the Pei Plan.  This image shows the marquee advertising for the 1929 film ''[[The Dance of Life]]'']]

Public reaction to the Pei Plan became more negative over time as the redevelopment plans failed to create viable retail or residential options, and community activists bemoaned the loss of historical buildings.  A preservationist group in Oklahoma City named the "Criterion Group" was named after the Criterion Theater &amp;ndash; one of the most significant historical casualties of the Pei Plan &amp;ndash; a French-style stage theater torn down in 1973 to make way for the Century Center (an enclosed shopping center which was largely vacant until 2015 when [[The Oklahoman]] opened offices in the space).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oklahoma ScissorTales: For The Oklahoman, it's great to be downtown again |url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-scissortales-for-the-oklahoman-its-great-to-be-downtown-again/article/5395187 |publisher=NewsOK.com |accessdate=2015-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criterion Group |url=http://www.okchistory.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=63:preservingabout&amp;catid=44:about-the-criterion-group&amp;Itemid=84 |publisher=OKCHistory.com |accessdate=2009-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007235908/http://www.okchistory.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=63%3Apreservingabout&amp;catid=44%3Aabout-the-criterion-group&amp;Itemid=84 |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criteriongroup.org/ |title=The Criterion Group, main page |publisher=The Criterion Group |accessdate=2009-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029035822/http://www.criteriongroup.org/ |archivedate=2009-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other casualties included the Baum Building (a Venetian-inspired structure that George Shirk attempted to save),&lt;ref name=Lackp32/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://okhistory.org/research/hillerman/results.php?mapnoinput=3h&amp;action=Search |publisher=OKCHistory.org |title=Baum Building |accessdate=2009-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707221731/http://okhistory.org/research/hillerman/results.php?mapnoinput=3h&amp;action=Search |archivedate=2009-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Hales Building (the owners of which fought condemnation efforts for nearly a decade),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-10-21 |url=http://okhistory.org/research/hillerman/results.php?mapnoinput=2a&amp;action=Search |publisher=OKCHistory.org |title=Hales Building |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707214404/http://okhistory.org/research/hillerman/results.php?mapnoinput=2a&amp;action=Search |archivedate=2009-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lackmeyer|Lackmeyer and Money]], pp. 20, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Biltmore Hotel, razed in 1977 to make way for the Myriad Botanical Gardens project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://okhistory.org/research/hillerman/results.php?mapnoinput=2y&amp;action=Search |publisher=OKCHistory.org |title=Biltmore Hotel |accessdate=2009-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725014049/http://okhistory.org/research/hillerman/results.php?mapnoinput=2y&amp;action=Search |archivedate=2009-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The delayed but negative reaction to the Pei Plan frustrated efforts by Oklahoma City authorities to instigate other urban renewal plans until the 1993 passage of the [[Metropolitan Area Projects]] (MAPS) initiative.

In '''''S v Mvelase''''' (2004), Mvelase was charged with three counts of [[rape]], committed against the same complainant, and was convicted and referred to a [[High Courts of South Africa|High Court]] for sentencing.

Before the Court confirmed the [[conviction]] and proceeded to sentencing of the accused, it was contended on his behalf that the proceedings in the court ''a quo'' had not been in accordance with justice, because the [[magistrate]] made no further enquiries when the accused's legal representative had closed his case without him testifying, although it had been indicated to the complainant that he would testify.

The court noted that “it would be a sad day indeed” if a presiding officer were to be required to assume the incompetence of legal representatives and was thus required to treat the accused as if he were unrepresented.

The court held that a [[judicial officer]] should be entitled to assume that a legal representative had informed the accused fully of her or his rights and that the decision not to testify was that of the accused himself.

The mere fact that in [[cross-examination|cross-examining]] [[Witness|witnesses]] the legal representative may have alluded to what the accused would testify did not lead, where the accused then failed to testify, to the inevitable inference that the defense case had been closed against the accused's wishes or that she or he did not know of her or his rights to testify.

The '''''Spartacus International Gay Guide''''' is an international gay travel guidebook published annually since 1970, originally by John D. Stamford, currently by [[Bruno Gmünder Verlag]] in [[Berlin, Germany]].

==Content==
The guide is arranged alphabetically by country and offers short texts in English, German, French, Spanish and Italian. Cities that are major gay travel destinations are described in greater depth.  Each country section includes a summary of the current [[Homosexuality laws of the world|laws about homosexuality]] that are applicable to that country. The majority of the book's contents are listings for businesses that either specifically cater to gay tourists or that may be of interest to gay travellers, such as [[gay bar|bars]], hotels, [[Gay bathhouse|gay saunas]], beaches, [[support group]]s, and AIDS hotlines.  Listings are arranged by city within each country.  Recent editions of the guide have counted more than 1200 pages with information for approximately 22,000 businesses in 160 countries.

The criteria that determine which businesses are included in the listings differ from country to country.  In countries or cities with a large number of businesses catering to gay customers, only businesses that are specifically gay &amp;ndash; and possibly even only the most noteworthy amongst these &amp;ndash; are included; in countries where such businesses are uncommon, those that cater to a general clientele but are "[[gay friendly]]" are also included.

In January 2012, Bruno Gmünder Media released the ''Spartacus International Gay Guide'' [[Mobile apps|App]] for [[iPhone]] in German and English. Bars, clubs, hotels, saunas, beaches and cruising spots are indicated on the city map via [[GPS]], and photos and additional information on venues are available. The app also provides tips on current activities, events, and specials (such as [[happy hours]] in the bar around the corner, for example). There are four versions available on the Apple [[App Store (iOS)]]: "Europe", "North America", "Latin America, Asia, Africa and Oceania" and "Worldwide".

In June 2013 the [[Bruno Gmünder Verlag]] released Version 2.0 of its Spartacus Gay Guide App including a version with a free selected content. Both Android and iOS versions are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacusworld.com/app/?lang=en|title=Spartacus App 2.0|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8259">A '''Special Weather Statement''' (Codename SPS with [[FEMA]] and [[National Weather Service]]) is a form of weather advisory. Special Weather Statements are issued by the [[National Weather Service]] of the United States (the NWS) and the [[Meteorological Service of Canada]] (the MSC). There are no set criteria for special weather statements in either country.

==United States==

A Special Weather Statement may be issued by the NWS for hazards that have not yet reached warning or advisory status or that do not have a specific code of their own, such as widespread [[funnel cloud]]s. They are also occasionally used to clear counties from severe weather [[tornado watch|watches]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/lmk/product_guide/products/severe/sps.php Special Weather Statement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A common form of special weather statement is a [[significant weather alert]]. Occasionally special weather statements appear as [[heat advisory|heat advisories]]. An EAS activation can and may be requested on very rare occasions.

==United States: Other Uses==

Special Weather Statements may also be issued for possible [[fire weather]] conditions, such as an enhanced risk. They even can be issued for rain/snow that may hit Advisory criteria such as snow being one inch that isn't going to likely pose a threat. Sometimes Special Weather Statements may be issued to update on current weather conditions, but that is sometimes issued by a [[Short Term Forecast]].

Relative humidity will fall to 30-35 percent late this morning
through this afternoon across much of New York City and Northeast
New Jersey. These low relative humidity values combined with
southwest winds gusting to 25-30 mph will result in an enhanced
risk for fire spread across these areas. Relative humidity values
are expected to increase and gusts diminish by this evening.

==Canada==

Special Weather Statements are issued by the MSC for weather events that are unusual or those that cause general inconvenience or public concern and cannot adequately be described in a weather forecast. These may include widespread events such as [[Arctic outflow]]s, [[Alberta clipper]]s, coastal [[fog]] banks, areas of possible [[thunderstorm]] development, and strong winds such as [[chinook wind|chinook]]s and [[les suetes wind]]s. They are written in a free style and may also reflect warnings in effect near the United States border.

{{coord|44|22|35.51|N|73|13|50.98|W|region:US|display=title}}

'''Stencil House''', built in 1804 on one hundred-acre farm in [[Columbus, New York]], was modeled after a Capen house, a small, side-gabled structure prevalent throughout the colonies in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=28 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715012626/http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=28 |archive-date=2009-07-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Named after Parson [[Joseph Capen]] of [[Topsfield, Massachusetts]], who built one of the earliest such structures in 1692, Capen houses reflect the British influence on early Puritan architecture. The house is now an 18th-century period [[historic house museum]] located at the [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]].

==History==

Built around a large central fireplace that opened on multiple sides to maximize warmth, Capen houses, like their medieval English counterparts, typically possessed three or four rooms on the ground floor: a parlor, a “hall,” a kitchen, and sometimes a foyer. The parlor traditionally functioned as a formal space and was not heated in the winter except on special occasions. The kitchen and hall acted as communal living spaces. The stairwell, not yet considered a focal point of design, remained a discreet and functional element of the house’s plan. While [[American colonists]] maintained the basic floor plan of the European houses, the ready and cheap supply of timber allowed them to use clapboard siding and shingled roofs rather than the mud and thatch common in [[Great Britain|Britain]].

Although Stencil House was constructed along this basic plan, the interior reflects a 19th-century decorum rather than the [[Puritan]] simplicity of earlier Capen Houses. The parlor maintains its position as a reception room and while the “hall” has become a formal dining room. Only the kitchen, at the rear of the structure, maintains its original use as a communal family area.

The extensive stenciling in the foyer, parlor, and dining room augment these formal embellishments. When the Museum acquired the building in 1953, wallpaper obscured the extensive stenciling. Before moving the house to the Museum, workers removed several layers of peeling paper, revealing the scope of the painted decoration beneath. Rather than confining motifs to borders, the Stencil House artist had covered entire walls, working directly on boards rather than on plaster walls. This work was probably completed sometime between 1810 and 1830.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-939384-19-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the stenciled designs in this house are identical to those found on the walls of the Farmersville Tavern, [[Farmersville, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Ann Eckert (2003).

==Collection==
===Wall treatments===
[[File:Stencil House, Interior.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Stencil House. Stencil wall treatments can be seen in the background.]]
Nineteenth-century American homeowners employed many methods in ornamenting their interiors. Rich paint colors and wallpaper were widely available in America as early as 1725 and by 1830 thousands of trade painters offered wallpapering, mural painting, and stenciling among their marketable talents. Shelburne Museum’s collection includes examples of all three types of wall treatments. 

Members of the upper class often imported French and English wallpaper to adorn formal rooms such as parlors, ballrooms, and dining rooms. These papers frequently represented scenic landscapes and possessed bright colors and bold patterning that could stand out even in weak candlelight.  

Mural painting offered an equally decorative but less expensive mode of adornment for those who could not afford to import expensive papers. Jonathan Poor, and his partner, Paine, worked as limners. Traveling around Maine, they offered their services as decorative painters charging $10 for a completed room. Represented in the Museum’s collection is an ornamental over-mantel and chimney-surround that Poor and Paine created in about 1830. Designed as part of a painted chamber of landscape murals, these paintings, with their views of busy harbors, farms, and forests, are outstanding examples of a decorative technique that is frequently lost to demolition.

In the early nineteenth century, itinerant artists would stencil walls in exchange for room and board. These artists would cut patterns from thin wood or heavy paper and use them to decorate walls and furniture. Stencil House’s parlor, dining room, and entrance hall exhibit a variety of stenciled patterns, including a grape leaf border, vases of flowers, and patriotic eagles, while [[Dutton House (Shelburne, Vermont)|Dutton House]]’s rooms and hallways reflect their original stenciled patterns.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''''The Good Food Guide''''' is an annual guidebook to the best [[restaurant]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] which has been published since 1951. It has been published by [[Waitrose]] since August 2013.&lt;ref name="The Grocer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/companies/supermarkets/waitrose/waitrose-buys-the-good-food-guide/348053.article|title=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/companies/supermarkets/waitrose/waitrose-buys-the-good-food-guide/348053.article|publisher=The Grocer|accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously published by [[Which?]]books.

The ''Good Food Guide'' was first published in 1951 by [[Raymond Postgate]], an enthusiastic [[gourmand]], who was appalled by the standard of contemporary catering. He recruited an army of volunteers to clandestinely visit and assess restaurants on the basis that, "You can corrupt one man. You can't bribe an army." Postgate had previously founded the Good Food Club in 1949.&lt;ref name='The Independent'&gt;{{cite news | first = Independent | title = Taste, the final frontier | date = 2004-09-23 | publisher = The Independent | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/taste-the-final-frontier-547269.html | work = The Independent | accessdate = 2010-11-12 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Good Food Guide'' currently reports on over 1,200 top establishments and is unique as it is completely rewritten every year and is entirely independent — there is no advertising or sponsorship, no fees are accepted for inclusion, and all of the inspections are anonymous.

Readers are actively encouraged to submit their reviews, via the [http://www.thegoodfoodguide.co.uk/feedback Good Food Guide website], which are then considered for prospective inclusion in next year's guide. The best contributors are put forward to become future restaurant inspectors for The ''Good Food Guide''. Restaurants are scored out of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegoodfoodguide.co.uk/how-the-entries-are-scored|title=How the entries are scored|publisher=The Good Food Guide|accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
An early contributor to the Guide, Margaret Costa later opened her own restaurant, Lacy's, in [[Mayfair]]. The Guide received so many reviews for Lacy's that the entry for the restaurant was divided into "Love Lacy's" and "Loathe Lacy's" columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/aug/13/guardianobituaries.lifeandhealth|title= Obituary: Margaret Costa|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2010-11-12|location=London|first=Nigel|last=Slater|date=2005-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 former Good Food Guide inspectors and editors criticised the Guide after a series of high-profile restaurant omissions, claiming that a new inspection and editorial regime had led to corners being cut after incorporating three hundred reader-recommended restaurants within its twelve hundred full entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/2007/11/22/317429/former-inspectors-lead-attack-on-the-good-food-guide.htm|title=Former inspectors lead attack on the Good Food Guide|publisher=caterersearch.com|accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former inspector and editor, Jim Ainsworth, described the new regime as "penny-pinching" and said of the 2008 guide: "The word that occurs to me is careless. A lot of things simply appear to have been done in a rush." Among the omissions, a restaurant was omitted in the [[Scilly Isles]] despite being listed as a main entry on the guide's map of the island. Some restaurants were omitted after a lack of reader reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/2007/11/22/317406/The-diners39-guide-and-the-missing-restaurants.htm|title=The diners' guide and the missing restaurants|publisher=caterersearch.com|accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publishers of the Guide, Which?, strongly denied the allegations, conceding that some former inspectors had been "disgruntled" at the changes, but stressed that most of the inspection team was unchanged and there had been no reduction in standards.

2008 saw the publication of special London edition of the Guide. This followed [[Michelin]] who had published a dedicated London guide the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/2008/02/15/319011/Good-Food-Guide-launches-dedicated-London-edition.htm|title=Good Food Guide launches dedicated London edition|publisher=caterersearch.com|accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013 edition of the ''Guide'', [[Heston Blumenthal]]'s [[The Fat Duck]] and Simon Rogan's [[L'Enclume]] shared a perfect score of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegoodfoodguide.co.uk/news/the-good-food-guide-2013-top-10|title=The Good Food Guide 2013: Top 10|publisher=The Good Food Guide|accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A branch of [[Little Chef]] near [[Popham, Hampshire|Popham]] was included in the 2010 guide after a makeover by Heston Blumenthal as part of a [[Channel 4]] programme.&lt;ref name='BBC'&gt;{{cite news | first = BBC | title = Little Chef makes Good Food Guide | date = 2010-08-28 | publisher = BBC | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/8225949.stm | work = BBC | accessdate = 2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, the guide was purchased and is now published by Waitrose.&lt;ref name="The Grocer"/&gt;

==Awards==
Every year the ''Guide'' presents its '''Editor's Awards''' in the following categories; Best New Entry: Restaurant, Best New Entry: Pub, Wine List of the Year, Chef of the Year, Chef to Watch, Pub of the year, Local Gem of the Year and Best Set Lunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegoodfoodguide.co.uk/awards/2015-editors-awards |title=2015 Editors' Awards |publisher=The Good Food Guide| accessdate = 2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate the Guide's sixtieth anniversary in 2010, the Guide presented a Lifetime Achievement Award to chef [[Raymond Blanc]] of [[Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons]] in [[Great Milton]], a restaurant that has spent 27 years in the guide. The award was presented in recognition of his "unerring commitment to consistency, quality and seasonal produce"

==Synopsis==

[[File:Heinrich Vogeler - Illustration Die sechs Schwäne.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Heinrich Vogeler]]]]

A King gets lost in a forest, and an old woman helps him, on the condition that he marry her beautiful daughter. The King has a bad feeling about this but accepts anyway. He has six sons and a daughter from his first marriage, however, and fears that the children will be targeted by his new wife; so he sends them away and visits them in secret. 

The new queen and now [[stepmother]], who has learned witchcraft from her mother, finds out about her stepchildren and decides to get them out of her way. She sews six magical shirts and goes to the hidden castle where the children are hidden for safety, then tosses the shirts over the boys and transforms them into [[swan]]s. 

The brothers can only take their human forms for fifteen minutes every evening. They tell their still human younger sister that they've heard of a way to break such curses: she must make six shirts out of [[nettle]]s and can't make a sound for six years or the spell will never be broken. The girl agrees to do this and runs away, hiding in a hunter's hut and dedicating herself solely to gathering the nettles and sewing in silence.

Years later, the King of another country finds the girl doing this, is taken by her beauty, and takes her into the court with the intention of making her his queen. However, the King's snobbish mother hates her and does not consider her fit to be a Queen. When she gives birth to their first child, the wicked mother-in-law takes away the child and accuses the queen of killing and eating him, but the King refuses to believe it. 

The young Queen gives birth to two other children, but twice again the mother-in-law hides them away and falsely claims that she has killed and eaten her babies. The King is unable to keep protecting her, and unable to properly defend herself, the queen is sentenced to be [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]] as a witch. All this time, she has held back her tears and her words, sewing and sewing the nettle shirts no matter what.

On the day of her execution, the Queen has all but finished making the shirts for her brothers. Only the last shirt misses a left arm. When she is brought to the stake she takes the shirts with her and when she is about to be burned, the seven years expire and the six swans come flying through the air. She throws the shirts over her brothers and they regain their human form, though the youngest prince's left arm remains a wing due to the missing sleeve. 

The queen is now free to speak, and she can defend herself against the accusations. She does so with the support of her brothers. In the end, the evil mother-in-law is the one who is burned at the stake as punishment.

==Adaptations==
* ''[[Daughter of the Forest]]'', the first book of the [[Sevenwaters trilogy]] by [[Juliet Marillier]], is a detailed retelling of this story in a medieval [[Celts|Celtic]] setting. A young woman named Sorcha must sew six shirts from a painful nettle plant in order to save her brothers (Liam, Diarmuid, Cormack, Connor, Finbar and Padriac) from the witch Lady Oonagh's enchantment, remaining completely mute until the task is finished. Falling in love with a British lord, Hugh of Harrowfield alias "Red", complicates her mission.

* An episode from the anime series ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.showtime.jp/app/detail/contents/l15vid200206901088352/ |title=新グリム名作劇場 第10話 六羽の白鳥 &amp;#124; アニメ &amp;#124; 動画はShowTime (ショウタイム) |website=Web.archive.org |date=2013-06-22 |accessdate=2016-06-05 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622031028/http://www.showtime.jp/app/detail/contents/l15vid200206901088352/ |archivedate=June 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Mitsuko Horie]] as the Princess (here named Elise), [[Toshiko Fujita]] as the witch, [[Hideyuki Hori]] as the prince, [[Ishizuka Unsho]] as the king, and [[Koichi Yamadera]], [[Taku Takemura]], [[Masami Kikuchi]], and Keiichi Naniwa as the brothers. This plot differs in some parts from the Grimm's version, especially in the second part of the story. In the anime, the evil stepmother-queen kills her husband and puts a spell on his children to gain total control of the kingdom like in the original, but later she takes up the role of the Princess/Queen's evil mother-in-law and leaves Elise's baby son (her only child) in the forest. The swan-brothers find their nephew the forest and keep him alive, plus they're stuck in their swan forms all day/night long (though they still can speak) until their sister breaks the curse and they give her the baby back. Elise finishes the garments in time, therefore the youngest is not left with a swan wing in the end. When the wicked stepmother is exposed as the witch ''and'' as the one who framed Elise at the end, she uses her magic in an attempt to escape but then accidentally catches fire from Elise's pyre and burns to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKPtShfBadw |title=GFTC - The Six Swans |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Paul Weiland]]'s episode "The Three Ravens" of [[Jim Henson]]'s television series ''[[The Storyteller]]'' is another retelling of this classic tale. After the queen dies, an evil witch ensnares the king and turn his three sons into [[raven]]s. The princess escapes and must stay silent for three years, three months, three weeks and three days to break the spell. But after she meets a handsome prince, this is suddenly not so easy, for her stepmother has killed her father and remarried - to the prince's father. But when the witch attempts to burn the princess at the stake, the ravens attack her and she accidentally sets fire to herself instead, instantly turning into ashes. Her death almost fully reverses the spell, but the princess breaks her silence three minutes too soon, and her youngest brother subsequently keeps one wing forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/me3/muppets/Story_ThreeRavens.html |title=The Storyteller Presents The Three Ravens |website=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The novel ''Birdwing'' by Rafe Martin follows the youngest prince, human but with a wing instead of his left arm, as he grows up with this "deformity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafemartin.com/bk_birdwing.html |title=Rafe Martin-Birdwing |website=Rafemartin.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Moonlight'' features a thirteen-year-old princess named Aowyn who loses her mother to a mysterious illness, and is charged with protecting her father and her six brothers from the conniving of a witch bent on taking the throne. This retelling is written by Ann Hunter and set on the Summer Isle, an alternate Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ann Hunter |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620664-moonlight |title=Moonlight by Ann Hunter — Reviews, Discussion, Bookclubs, Lists |website=Goodreads.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Historical Thesaurus.jpg|thumb|''Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary'', two-volume set]]
In general usage, a '''thesaurus''' is a [[reference work]] that lists words grouped together according to similarity of meaning (containing [[synonyms]] and sometimes [[antonyms]]), in contrast to a [[dictionary]], which provides [[definitions]] for words, and generally lists them in alphabetical order. The main purpose of such reference works for users "to find the word, or words, by which [an] idea may be most fitly and aptly expressed"&amp;nbsp;– to quote [[Peter Mark Roget]], architect of the best known thesaurus in the English language.&lt;ref name="Roget"&gt;Roget, Peter. 1852. ''Thesaurus of English Language Words and Phrases''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although including synonyms, a thesaurus should not be taken as a complete list of all the synonyms for a particular word. The entries are also designed for drawing distinctions between similar words and assisting in choosing exactly the right word. Unlike a [[dictionary]], a thesaurus entry does not give the definition of words.

In [[library science]] and [[information science]], thesauri have been widely used to specify domain models.  Recently, thesauri have been implemented with [[Simple Knowledge Organization System]] (SKOS).{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== Etymology ==
The word "thesaurus" is derived from 16th-century [[New Latin]], in turn from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:en:thesaurus#Latin|thēsaurus]]'', which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinisation]] of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:en:θησαυρός#Ancient Greek|θησαυρός]]}} (''thēsauros''), "treasure, treasury, storehouse".&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=thesaurus "thesaurus"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''thēsauros'' is of uncertain etymology. [[Douglas Harper]] derives it from the root of the Greek verb τιθέναι ''tithenai'', "to put, to place."&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt; [[Robert S. P. Beekes|Robert Beekes]] rejected an [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] derivation and suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] suffix {{nowrap|''*-ar&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;o-''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 16th to the 19th centuries, the term "thesaurus" was applied to any [[dictionary]] or [[encyclopedia]], as in the ''[[Thesaurus linguae latinae]]'' (1532), and the ''[[Thesaurus linguae graecae]]'' (1572). The meaning "collection of words arranged according to sense" is first attested in 1852 in Roget's title and ''thesaurer'' is attested in [[Middle English]] for "[[treasurer]]".&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Roget P M.jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[Peter Mark Roget]], author of the first thesaurus.]]
In antiquity, [[Philo of Byblos]] authored the first text that could now be called a thesaurus. In [[Sanskrit]], the [[Amarakosha]] is a thesaurus in verse form, written in the 4th century. The Amarakosha mentions 18 prior works, but they have all been lost.

The first modern thesaurus was ''[[Roget's Thesaurus]]'', first compiled in 1805 by [[Peter Mark Roget]], and published in 1852. Since its publication it has never been out of print and is still a widely used work across the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199254729.001.0001/acprof-9780199254729-chapter-1|title=Introduction - Oxford Scholarship|author=|date=|website=oxfordscholarship.com|accessdate=26 March 2018|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199254729.001.0001/acprof-9780199254729-chapter-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entries in ''Roget's Thesaurus'' are listed conceptually rather than alphabetically.
Roget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded. Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my own deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd 1982, p. xix{{Full citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thesauri have been used to perform automatic [[word-sense disambiguation]]&lt;ref&gt;Yarowsky, David. "[https://aclanthology.info/pdf/C/C92/C92-2070.pdf Word-sense disambiguation using statistical models of Roget's categories trained on large corpora]."

'''Thomas Hewitt Key''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (20 March 1799 – 29 November 1875) was an [[England|English]] [[classical scholar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Key, Thomas Hewitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in [[London]] and educated at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]] Colleges, Cambridge, and graduated 19th [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]] in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=KY816TH|name=Key, Thomas &lt;nowiki&gt;[Hewett]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1825 to 1827 he was the founding professor of Pure [[mathematics]] in the [[University of Virginia]], and after his return to England was appointed (1828) professor of [[Latin]] in the newly founded [[University of London]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1832 he became joint headmaster of the school founded in connection with that institution (the [[University College School]]); in 1842 he resigned the [[Professor of Latin (University College London)|professorship of Latin]], and took up that of comparative grammar, together with the undivided headmastership of the school. These two posts he held until his death.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} A few years before his death, he also took the position of secretary to the College of Preceptors in London (later known as the [[College of Teachers]]).

Key is best known for his introduction of the crude-form (the uninflected form or stem of words) system, in general use among [[Sanskrit]] grammarians, into the teaching of the classical languages. This system was embodied in his ''Latin Grammar'' (1846). In ''Language, its Origin and Development'' (1874), he upheld the [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] theory.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Key was prejudiced against the German Sanskritists, and the [[etymology|etymological]] portion of his ''Latin Dictionary'', published in 1888, was severely criticized on this account. He was a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and president of the [[Philological Society]], to the ''Transactions'' of which he contributed largely.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Key was the great-grandfather of British authors [[Rumer Godden]] and [[Jon Godden]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1696">'''Titan Leeds''' (1699–1738) was an 18th-century American [[almanac]] publisher.

A "good friend and fellow student" of [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s, he is best known through Franklin's mentions of him in the rival publication ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]''. Franklin used the first edition of his almanac to predict Leeds's death (Oct. 17, 1733, 3:29 P.M., at the very instant of the conjunction of the Sun and Mercury), and encouraged his readers to buy next year's edition of ''Poor Richard's Almanac'' to see if Franklin was right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golden Nuggets from U.

When challenged by the very much alive Leeds, Franklin insisted that Leeds had in fact died, but that he was being impersonated by an inferior publisher. When Leeds actually died in 1738 Benjamin Franklin publicly commended the impostors for ending their charade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/Hoaxipedia/Death_of_Titan_Leeds/|title=Death of Titan Leeds - Hoaxipedia|website=www.museumofhoaxes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3456">'''Van Gogh and Britain''' is an exhibition of [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s paintings that will be hosted by [[Tate Britain]] between 27 March and 11 August 2019.

== Exhibition ==
The exhibition will be held at [[Tate Britain]] between 27 March and 11 August 2019. It will cover Van Gogh's impact on British painters and his connection with Britain when he was working as a trainee art dealer in London between 1873 and 1876&lt;ref name="Guardian_5Nov18" /&gt; - such as with the novels of [[Charles Dickens]] and [[George Eliot]], as well as paintings by [[John Constable]] and [[John Everett Millais]]. It also covers British artists inspired by Van Gogh, including [[Francis Bacon]], [[David Bomberg]] and the [[Camden Town Group]].&lt;ref name="tate" /&gt;

The museum's previous Van Gogh exhibition took place in 1947, which lasted 5 weeks with over 157,000 visitors, including the Queen, and was sponsored by the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]]. The attendance of the exhibition was so high that the Tate subsequently requested reimbursement for 3 years worth of wear-and-tear on its flooring during the 5 weeks of the exhibition from the Arts Council. Half of the visitors were during the weekend, when exhibition entry was free, while the other half attended during the week, paying a shilling each, totaling £3,000.&lt;ref name="Guardian_5Nov18" /&gt;

Entrance to the exhibition costs £22, with a concession rate of £20.&lt;ref name="tate" /&gt;

The '''École du Louvre''' is an institution of [[higher education]] located in the Aile de Flore of the [[Louvre Palace]] in [[Paris]], [[France]]. It is dedicated to the study of [[archaeology]], [[art history]], [[anthropology]] and [[epigraphy]].

Admission is based on a competitive entrance exam after high school ([[lycée]]), though candidates may also apply after two or three years of university studies in the subjects of history, classics, literature, geography, philosophy and art.&lt;ref name="index2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecoledulouvre.fr/index2.html |accessdate=2008-04-06 |title=Ecole du Louvre : enseignement, recherche et publications en histoire de l'art |date=2004-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225025724/http://www.ecoledulouvre.fr/index2.html |archivedate=2007-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school offers an undergraduate program, a master's program and a doctoral program as well as a preparation class for civil service entrance exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/dmf-etabliss.htm |accessdate=2008-04-06 |title=Ministère de la culture et de la communication : Direction des musées de France, Administration centrale - Etablissements publics et statuts particuliers |date=2002-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The École du Louvre was created in 1882 with the mission to "extract from the collections the knowledge they contain, and to train curators, missionaries and excavators". The school was originally dedicated to [[archaeology]], but soon expanded to related disciplines, such as [[history of art]], [[anthropology]] and ancient languages.&lt;ref name="index2"/&gt;

The school was created in a context of expansion of higher education in Europe, and in France in particular, which was reflected by providing lectures to the general public in addition to providing an education to students. Public lectures and conferences aimed at fee-paying "auditors", and summer school, continues the tradition on which the school was based. 

Other prestigious institutions were created during the same period in France, such as the [[Institut d'études politiques de Paris]] (Sciences-Po) or the [[École des Hautes Études Commerciales]] (HEC).

In 1920, the school established the General Art History course (known as ''HGA''), that became the foundation for the curriculum. This course would develop into the current graduate program over the following years.

In 1927, the school was innovative by creating the chair of [[museology]], the first such in the world.

In 1998, following the development of the ''Grand Louvre'', the school moved to its present location in the Aile de Flore, the river-facing wing of the museum.

The [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] or the [[Ecole Boulle]] are also well known art institutions in France.

==Teaching==
[[Image:EdL-Hall.jpg|left|thumb|The entrance hall in the École du Louvre.]]
As of 2006, the École du Louvre complies with the [[Bologna process]] and offers an undergraduate degree after three years (''Premier Cycle''), a master's degree after two years (''Deuxième cycle'') and a research degree in three years (''Troisième Cycle''). It also provides preparation classes for some civil service exams as well as conferences for a wider public. Altogether, there are about 700 teaching staff.

===Premier cycle===
Undergraduate students follow a core course called ''HGA'' (General [[Art History]] studying various periods and areas). Lectures are held in an amphitheatre, and tutorials are held in  various museums providing a "hands-on" experience with the material.

The first year is dedicated to the Antiquity, with an emphasis on [[Prehistoric archaeology|Prehistoric]], [[Classical archaeology|Classical]] and Oriental Archaeology.

The second year focuses on the History of Art and Archaeology of the non-Western world, as well as the study of the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]].

The final year focuses on the History of Art in modern times, and [[African Art|African]] and [[Oceanian art|Oceana Art]] including Anthropology.

In addition to the core course, in their first year students choose a specialisation area to study for the duration of the degree, known as ''cours organiques'' or ''spé''. Currently 31 specialisations (or ''cours organiques'') exist such as [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[sculpture]], [[engraving]], [[furniture]], [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[filmmaking|cinema]], [[fashion]], [[photography]] created in various areas all over the world such as in Europe, Africa, America, Oceania or Middle and Far East. Students also take courses in [[Epigraphy]], [[Numismatics]] or [[Modern Languages]].

===Deuxième cycle===
[[Image:Ecole Louvre.jpg|right|thumb|The Aile de Flore, the Ecole du Louvre's frontage.]]
The master's program is composed of two years. During the first year, students study museology and research methods. At the end of the second year, students submit a master's thesis highlighting research and work experience.

===Troisième cycle===
Although the research program is not formally a doctoral program, delivering a ''diplôme de recherche approfondie'' instead, students spend the three or more years conducting extensive academic research under the direction of a supervisor from the '''École du Louvre'''.

==Academic partnerships==
The École du Louvre has exchange agreements with the [[Université de Montréal]] in [[Quebec]], the [[Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti]] in [[Venice]], [[Italy]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]] in [[Germany]]. In October 2014, a new dual degree Master's program between the Ecole du Louvre and Sciences Po was announced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://etudiant.lefigaro.fr/orientation/actus-et-conseils/detail/article/l-ecole-du-louvre-multiplie-les-doubles-diplomes-3438/|title=L’école du Louvre multiplie les doubles diplômes|work=Le Figaro Etudiant|access-date=2018-07-05|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Library and publications==
The École du Louvre possesses one of the largest Art History and Archeology [[fonds|collections]], which is made available to academics and students.

The École du Louvre regularly publishes books, manuals and academic research, often in conjunction with an external publishing house.
