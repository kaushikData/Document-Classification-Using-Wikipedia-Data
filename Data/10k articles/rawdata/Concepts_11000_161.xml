The '''act-of-state doctrine''' or '''foreign act of state doctrine''' is a principle in [[English law|English]] and United States law which states that every [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] state is bound to respect the independence of every other sovereign state, and the courts will not sit in judgment of another government's acts done within its own territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Twomey|first=David|title=Business Law: Principles for Today's Commercial Environment|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Masson, OH|isbn=978-0-324-78669-9|pages=G-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref name=DLA&gt;Chalk, E., ''et al'', [https://www.lexology.com/library/document.ashx?g=315b1de8-df72-49ff-8b66-829a697c3df9 A reliable decision: foreign act of state doctrine applies in English arbitration], published 16 July 2018, accessed 23 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine is not required by [[international law]] (neither [[customary international law]] nor [[treaty]] law), but it is a principle recognized and adhered to by [[United States federal courts|United States federal and state courts]].&lt;ref&gt;''3rd Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States,'' §443, comment g (citing ''Sabbatino'': "the act of state doctrine . . . must be treated exclusively as an aspect of federal law," 376 U.S. at 425, and stating that "State courts are bound by the federal doctrine, and a decision of a State court sitting in judgment on the act of a foreign state would be subject to review by the Supreme Court.")&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the rationales for the doctrine include respect for other nations' sovereignty and protection of the U.S. [[executive (government)|Executive]]'s prerogative in foreign affairs, both of which may be frustrated by a decision issuing from U.S. courts.&lt;ref&gt;''3rd Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States,'' §443, comment a.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act of State Doctrine enters consideration most often in cases where a foreign sovereign has expropriated the property of a U.S. national located in that foreign territory (e.g. through nationalization). Rather than pursuing recourse through the courts, United States nationals are to take their claims against foreign sovereign governments to the Executive so that the government can either espouse the claims of all U.S. nationals as a group or seek recourse through diplomatic channels. The United States employs the Act of State Doctrine more broadly and with more frequency than other countries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Background==
The Act of State Doctrine, which arose out of [[Thirteen American colonies|colonial]] practice in the 17th Century, entered into American jurisprudence in the case '''''Underhill v. Hernandez''''', {{ussc|168|250|1897}}.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis A. Bradley and Jack L. Goldsmith. ''Foreign Relations Law, 4th ed.''  Wolters Kluwer, 2011. p96&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1892 revolution, General [[José Manuel "Mocho" Hernández]] expelled the existing [[Venezuela]]n government and took control of [[Ciudad Bolivar]], where plaintiff Underhill lived and ran a waterworks system for the city. Underhill, an American citizen, repeatedly applied to Hernandez for an exit passport, but his requests were refused, and Underhill was forced to stay in Ciudad Bolivar and run the waterworks. Hernandez finally relented and allowed Underhill to return to the United States, where he instituted an action to recover damages for his detention in Venezuela. In finding for the Defendant, a New York Court determined that Hernandez had acted in his official capacity as a military commander so his actions were those of the Venezuelan government. The Court therefore refused to hear Underhill's claim against the government based on the Act of State Doctrine. The Court reasoned, "Every sovereign state is bound to respect the independence of every other sovereign state, and the courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another, done within its own territory."&lt;ref&gt;''Underhill v. Hernandez'', 168 U.S. 250, 252 (1897).&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino''==

In ''[[Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino]]'', {{ussc|376|398|1964}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] applied the Act of State Doctrine even where the state action likely violated international law. The case arose when [[Cuba]] nationalized its [[sugar]] industry, taking control of sugar refineries and other companies in the wake of the Cuban revolution. A large number of Americans who had invested in those companies lost their investments without compensation when the Cuban government assumed control. However, despite the loss suffered by United States nationals, the Supreme Court upheld the Act of State Doctrine by assuming the validity of Cuba's domestic action and therefore rejected the claim of US nationals against Cuba for their lost investments.

The ''Sabbatino'' Court stated that although the Doctrine is not found in the [[Constitution]], explicitly or implicitly, it does have "constitutional underpinnings" in the concept of [[separation of powers]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] reasoned that because the Executive had exclusive authority to conduct foreign affairs with other nations on behalf of [[the United States]], disputes arising from the official actions of foreign sovereign powers should not be settled by the Judiciary because those decisions could interfere with the Executive's conduct of foreign affairs.&lt;ref&gt;''Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino'', 376 U.S. 398 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Hickenlooper Amendment==
In response to the outcome of the case, Congress enacted {{UnitedStatesCode|22|2370}}, more commonly referred to as the "Second Hickenlooper Amendment", named after the bill's sponsor, [[Bourke B. Hickenlooper]], an [[Iowa]] Senator. Generally, under the Hickenlooper Amendment, courts are not to apply the Act of State Doctrine as a bar against hearing cases of expropriation by a foreign sovereign. There is an exception if the Executive requests that the courts consider the Act of State Doctrine because foreign policy interests may be damaged by judicial interference:
:"this subparagraph shall not be applicable . . . (2) in any case with respect to which the President determines that application of the act of state doctrine is required in that particular case by the foreign policy interests of the United States and a suggestion to this effect is filed on his behalf in that case with the court." &lt;ref&gt;22 U.S.C. 2370(e)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==English law==
The foreign act of state doctrine applies in English law.&lt;ref&gt;United Kingdom Supreme Court, [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/3.html Belhaj and another (Respondents) v Straw and others (Appellants); Rahmatullah (No 1) (Respondent) v Ministry of Defence and another (Appellants)] 17 January 2017, accessed 26 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, the English [[Commercial Court (England and Wales)|Commercial Court]] ruled that it also applies in English [[arbitration]].&lt;ref name=DLA /&gt;

{{Emotions}}

'''Anger''' or '''wrath''' is an intense expression of [[emotion]]. It involves a strong uncomfortable and hostile response to a perceived provocation, hurt or threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing |edition=3rd |last=Videbeck |first=Sheila L. |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anger can occur when a person feels their [[personal boundaries]] are being or are about to be violated.  Some have a learned tendency to react to anger through retaliation as a way of coping. Raymond Novaco of University of California Irvine, who since 1975 has published a plethora of literature on the subject, stratified anger into three modalities: cognitive (appraisals), [[Somatic nervous system|somatic]]-[[affective]] (tension and agitations), and behavioral (withdrawal and antagonism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978148319968950002X|title=Advances in the Study of Aggression|last=Novaco|first=Raymond W.|date=|publisher=Academic Press|year=1986|isbn=9781483199689|editor-last=Blanchard|editor-first=Robert J.|volume=2|location=|pages=1–67|chapter=Anger as a Clinical and Social Problem|doi=10.1016/b978-1-4831-9968-9.50002-x|oclc=899004162|quote=|editor-last2=Blanchard|editor-first2=D. Caroline|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; William DeFoore, an [[anger management]] writer, described anger as a pressure cooker: we can only apply pressure against our anger for a certain amount of time until it explodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anger : Deal with It, Heal with It, Stop It from Killing You |edition=1st |last=DeFoore |first=William |publisher=Health Communications, Inc. |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person experiencing anger will often experience physical conditions, such as increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and increased levels of [[epinephrine|adrenaline]] and [[norepinephrine|noradrenaline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Medicine.net |title=Anger definition |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33843 |accessdate=2008-04-05 |edition= |publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some view anger as an emotion which triggers part of the [[fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]] brain response.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, W., Schoenfeld, C. D., Gwynne, P. W., Weissler, A. M.,''Circulatory and humoral responses to fear and anger'', The Physiologist, 1964, 7, 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Anger is used as a protective mechanism to cover up fear, hurt or sadness. Anger becomes the predominant feeling behaviorally, cognitively, and physiologically when a person makes the conscious choice to take action to immediately stop the threatening behavior of another outside force.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond DiGiuseppe, Raymond Chip Tafrate, ''Understanding Anger Disorders'', Oxford University Press, 2006, pp. 133–159.&lt;/ref&gt; The English term originally comes from the term ''anger'' of [[Old Norse]] language.&lt;ref&gt;Anger,''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition, 2000, Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Anger can have many physical and mental consequences.

The external expression of anger can be found in [[facial expression]]s, body language, physiological responses, and at times public acts of [[aggression]]. Facial expressions can range from inward angling of the eyebrows to a full frown.&lt;ref name="OxfDic"&gt;Michael Kent, ''Anger'', The Oxford Dictionary of Sports Science &amp; Medicine, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-262845-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some animals, for example, make loud sounds, attempt to look physically larger, bare their teeth, and stare.&lt;ref name="Primate"/&gt; The behaviors associated with anger are designed to warn aggressors to stop their threatening behavior. Rarely does a physical altercation occur without the prior expression of anger by at least one of the participants.&lt;ref name="Primate"&gt;Primate Ethology, 1967, Desmond Morris (Ed.). Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Publishers: London, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; While most of those who experience anger explain its arousal as a result of "what has happened to them," psychologists point out that an angry person can very well be mistaken because anger causes a loss in self-monitoring capacity and objective observability.&lt;ref name="EncPsy"&gt;Raymond W. Novaco, ''Anger'', Encyclopedia of Psychology, [[Oxford University Press]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern psychologists view anger as a primary, natural, and mature emotion experienced by virtually all humans at times, and as something that has functional value for survival. Anger is seen as a supportive mechanism to show a person that something is wrong and requires changing. Anger can mobilize psychological resources for corrective action. Uncontrolled anger can, however, negatively affect personal or social [[Quality of life|well-being]]&lt;ref name="EncPsy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethics"&gt;John W. Fiero, ''Anger'', Ethics, Revised Edition, Vol 1&lt;/ref&gt;  and impact negatively on those around them. It is equally challenging to be around an angry person and the impact can also cause psychological/emotional trauma if not dealt with. While many philosophers and writers have warned against the spontaneous and uncontrolled fits of anger, there has been disagreement over the intrinsic value of anger.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory" /&gt; The issue of dealing with anger has been written about since the times of the earliest philosophers, but modern psychologists, in contrast to earlier writers, have also pointed out the possible harmful effects of suppressing anger.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory" /&gt; [[Affect display|Displays]] of anger can be used as a [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]] strategy for [[social influence]].&lt;ref name="Sutton1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hochschild1"/&gt;

==Psychology and sociology==
[[File: The Rage of Achilles by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.jpeg|thumb|''The Anger of Achilles'', by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] depicts the Greek hero attacking [[Agamemnon]].]]
Three types of anger are recognized by psychologists:&lt;ref name="EoE"&gt;Paul M. Hughes, ''Anger'', Encyclopedia of Ethics, Vol I, Second Edition, Rutledge Press&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Hasty and sudden anger''' is connected to the impulse for self-preservation. It is shared by human and other animals, and it occurs when the animal is tormented or trapped. This form of anger is episodic.
# '''Settled and deliberate anger''' is a reaction to perceived ''deliberate'' harm or unfair treatment by others. This form of anger is episodic.
# '''Dispositional anger''' is related more to character traits than to instincts or cognitions. Irritability, sullenness, and churlishness are examples of the last form of anger.

Anger can potentially mobilize psychological resources and boost determination toward correction of wrong behaviors, promotion of [[social justice]], communication of negative sentiment, and redress of grievances. It can also facilitate patience. In contrast, anger can be destructive when it does not find its appropriate outlet in expression. Anger, in its strong form, impairs one's ability to process information and to exert [[cognitive control]] over their [[behavior]]. An angry person may lose his/her objectivity, empathy, prudence or thoughtfulness and may cause harm to themselves or others.&lt;ref name="EncPsy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=P. |first=Mohr |last2=Howells |first2=K. |last3=Gerace |first3=A. |last4=Day |first4=A. |last5=Wharton |first5=P. |year=2007 |title=The role of perspective taking in anger arousal |url= |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=507–517 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2006.12.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Day |first=A. |last2=Mohr |first2=P. |last3=Howells |first3=K. |last4=Gerace |first4=A. |last5=Lim |first5=L. |year=2012 |title=The role of empathy in anger arousal in violent offenders and university students |url= |journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=599–613 |doi=10.1177/0306624X11431061 |pmid=22158909 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a sharp distinction between anger and [[aggression]] (verbal or physical, direct or indirect) even though they mutually influence each other. While anger can activate aggression or increase its probability or intensity, it is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for aggression.&lt;ref name="EncPsy"/&gt;

===Neuropsychological perspective===
Extension of the Stimuli of the Fighting Reactions. At the beginning of life the human infant struggles indiscriminately against any restraining force, whether it be another human being or a blanket which confines his movements. There is no inherited susceptibility to social stimuli, as distinct from other stimulation, in anger. At a later date the child learns that certain actions, such as striking, scolding, and screaming, are effective toward persons, but not toward things. In adults, although the infantile response is still sometimes seen, the fighting reaction becomes fairly well limited to stimuli whose hurting or restraining influence can be thrown off by physical violence.&lt;ref name="https://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Allport/1924/1924_03.html"&gt;Fundamental Activities — Inherited and Learned&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between related concepts==
The words [[annoyance]] and [[Rage (emotion)|rage]] are often imagined to be at opposite ends of an emotional continuum: mild irritation and annoyance at the low end and fury or murderous rage at the high end. Rage problems are conceptualized as "the inability to process emotions or life's experiences"&lt;ref name=" Parker Hall 2008"&gt;Parker Hall, 2008, ''Anger, Rage and Relationship: An Empathic Approach to Anger Management'', Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; either because the capacity to regulate emotion (Schore, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;Schore AN, 1994, ''Affect Regulation and the Origin of Self'', Hillsdale, NJ, Erlbaum Associates, Inc&lt;/ref&gt; has never been sufficiently developed or because it has been temporarily lost due to more recent trauma. Rage is understood as raw, undifferentiated emotions, that spill out when another life event that cannot be processed, no matter how trivial, puts more [[Stress (biology)|stress]] on the [[organism]] than it can bear.

Anger, when viewed as a protective response or instinct to a perceived threat, is considered as positive. The negative expression of this state is known as aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Gottman &amp; Levenson, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Acting on this misplaced state is rage due to possible potential errors in perception and judgment.

==Characteristics==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
One simple dichotomy of anger expression is '''passive anger''' versus '''aggressive anger''' versus '''assertive anger'''.
These three types of anger have some characteristic symptoms:
 {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Passive anger===
Passive anger can be expressed in the following ways: {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* '''[[Apathy|Dispassion]]''', such as giving someone the [[cold shoulder]] or a fake smile, looking unconcerned or "[[sitting on the fence]]" while others sort things out, dampening feelings with [[substance abuse]], overreacting, oversleeping, not responding to another's anger, frigidity, indulging in sexual practices that depress spontaneity and make objects of participants, giving inordinate amounts of time to machines, objects or intellectual pursuits, talking of frustrations but showing no feeling.
* '''[[Evasion (ethics)|Evasiveness]]''', such as turning one's back in a crisis, avoiding conflict, not arguing back, becoming [[phobia|phobic]].
* '''[[Defeatism]]''', such as [[Setting up to fail|setting yourself and others up for failure]], choosing unreliable people to depend on, being [[Accident-proneness|accident prone]], [[Underachiever|underachieving]], [[erectile disfunction|sexual impotence]], expressing frustration at insignificant things but ignoring serious ones.
* '''[[Obsessive compulsive disorder|Obsessive behavior]]''', such as needing to be inordinately clean and tidy, making a habit of constantly checking things, over-dieting or overeating, demanding that all jobs be done perfectly.
* '''[[Psychological manipulation]]''', such as provoking people to aggression and then patronizing them, provoking aggression but staying on the sidelines, [[emotional blackmail]], [[Crocodile tears|false tearfulness]], feigning illness, [[sabotage|sabotaging]] [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s, using [[promiscuity|sexual provocation]], using a third party to convey negative feelings, withholding money or resources.
* '''[[Secretive|Secretive behavior]]''', such as stockpiling resentments that are expressed behind people's backs, giving the [[silent treatment]] or under-the-breath mutterings, avoiding eye contact, putting people down, [[gossip]]ing, anonymous complaints, [[poison pen letter]]s, [[theft|stealing]], and [[confidence trick|conning]].
* '''[[Self-blame]]''', such as apologizing too often, being overly critical, inviting [[criticism]].

===Aggressive anger===
The symptoms of aggressive anger are:
* '''[[Bullying]]''', such as threatening people directly, persecuting, insulting, pushing or shoving, using power to oppress, shouting, driving someone off the road, playing on people's [[vulnerability|weaknesses]].
* '''[[Destructiveness (phrenology)|Destructiveness]]''', such as destroying objects as in [[vandalism]], [[cruelty to animals|harming animals]], [[child abuse]], destroying a relationship, [[reckless driving]], [[substance abuse]].
* '''[[Grandiosity]]''', such as showing off, expressing [[mistrust]], not delegating, being a sore loser, wanting center stage all the time, not listening, talking over people's heads, expecting kiss and make-up sessions to solve problems.
* '''Hurtfulness''', such as [[violence]], including [[sexual abuse]] and [[rape]], [[verbal abuse]], biased or [[vulgarity|vulgar joke]]s, breaking confidence, using [[profanity|foul language]], [[empathy#Lack|ignoring people's feelings]], willfully [[discrimination|discriminating]], [[blame|blaming]], punishing people for unwarranted deeds, labeling others.
* '''Risk-taking behavior''', such as speaking too fast, walking too fast,  driving too fast, reckless spending.
* '''[[Selfishness]]''', such as ignoring others' needs, not responding to requests for help, [[cutting in line|queue jumping]].
* '''[[Threat]]s''', such as [[intimidation|frightening people]] by saying how one could harm them, [[vandalism#Vandalism as crime|their property]] or their prospects, finger pointing, fist shaking, wearing clothes or symbols associated with violent behaviour, [[tailgating]], [[road rage|excessively blowing a car horn]], slamming doors.
* '''Unjust [[blame|blaming]]''', such as accusing other people for one's own mistakes, blaming people for your own feelings, making general accusations.
* '''[[Unpredictability]]''', such as explosive rages over minor [[frustration]]s, attacking indiscriminately, dispensing unjust [[punishment]], inflicting harm on others for the sake of it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://playangrybirds.co.in |title=playangrybirds.co.in |publisher=playangrybirds.co.in |date=2012-11-03 |accessdate=2014-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419083811/http://playangrybirds.co.in/ |archive-date=2014-04-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; illogical arguments.
* '''[[revenge|Vengeance]]''', such as being over-punitive. This differs from retributive justice, as vengeance is personal, and possibly unlimited in scale.

===Assertive anger===
*'''[[Blame]]''', such as after a particular individual commits an action that’s possibly frowned upon, the particular person will resort to scolding. This is in fact, common in discipline terms.
*'''[[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]]''', the angry person will give a temporary punishment to an individual like further limiting a child’s will to do anything they want like playing video games, no reading, etc, after they did something to cause trouble.
*'''Sternness''', such as calling out a person on their behaviour, with their voices raised with utter disapproval/disappointment.

===Six dimensions of anger expression===
Anger expression can take on many more styles than passive or aggressive. Ephrem Fernandez has identified six dimensions of anger expression. They relate to the direction of anger, its locus, reaction, modality, impulsivity, and objective. Coordinates on each of these dimensions can be connected to generate a profile of a person's anger expression style. Among the many profiles that are theoretically possible in this system, are the familiar profile of the person with explosive anger, profile of the person with repressive anger, profile of the [[passive aggressive]] person, and the profile of constructive anger expression.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez, E. (2008). "The angry personality: A representation on six dimensions of anger expression." In G. J Boyle, D. Matthews &amp; D. Saklofske (eds.).

==Causes==
People feel angry when they sense that they or someone they care about has been offended, when they are certain about the nature and cause of the angering event, when they are convinced someone else is responsible, and when they feel they can still influence the situation or [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with it.&lt;ref name="Anger pg 290"&gt;International Handbook of Anger. p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a person's car is damaged, they will feel angry if someone else did it (e.g. another driver rear-ended it), but will feel sadness instead if it was caused by situational forces (e.g. a hailstorm) or guilt and shame if they were personally responsible (e.g. he crashed into a wall out of momentary carelessness). Psychotherapist Michael C. Graham defines anger in terms of our expectations and assumptions about the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Michael C. |title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment |date=2014 |publisher=Outskirts Press |isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham states anger almost always results when we are caught up "...&amp;nbsp;expecting the world to be different than it is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Michael C. |title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment |date=2014 |publisher=Outskirts Press |page=73 |isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, those who experience anger explain its arousal as a result of "what has happened to them" and in most cases the described provocations occur immediately before the anger experience. Such explanations confirm the illusion that anger has a discrete external cause. The angry person usually finds the cause of their anger in an intentional, personal, and controllable aspect of another person's behavior. This explanation, however, is based on the intuitions of the angry person who experiences a loss in self-monitoring capacity and objective observability as a result of their emotion. Anger can be of multicausal origin, some of which may be remote events, but people rarely find more than ''one'' cause for their anger.&lt;ref name="EncPsy"/&gt; According to Novaco, "Anger experiences are embedded or nested within an environmental-temporal context. Disturbances that may not have involved anger at the outset leave residues that are not readily recognized but that operate as a lingering backdrop for focal provocations (of anger)."&lt;ref name="EncPsy"/&gt; According to Encyclopædia Britannica, an internal [[infection]] can cause [[pain]] which in turn can activate anger.&lt;ref name="Britannica11"&gt;"emotion." [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive effects==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}} &lt;!--The whole introduction, from "Anger makes people think..." to "...optimistic risk assessments." needs to be sourced--&gt;
Anger causes a reduction in cognitive ability and the accurate processing of external stimuli. Dangers seem smaller, actions seem less risky, ventures seem more likely to succeed, and unfortunate events seem less likely. Angry people are more likely to make risky decisions, and make less realistic risk assessments. In one study, test subjects primed to feel angry felt less likely to suffer heart disease, and more likely to receive a pay raise, compared to fearful people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.1.146 |author1=Jennifer S.

In inter-group relationships, anger makes people think in more negative and prejudiced terms about outsiders. Anger makes people less trusting, and slower to attribute good qualities to outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;

Unlike other negative emotions like sadness and fear, angry people are more likely to demonstrate [[correspondence bias]] – the tendency to blame a person's behavior more on his nature than on his circumstances. They tend to rely more on stereotypes, and pay less attention to details and more attention to the superficial. In this regard, anger is unlike other "negative" emotions such as sadness and fear, which promote analytical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;International Handbook of Anger. Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;

An angry person tends to anticipate other events that might cause them anger. They will tend to rate anger-causing events (e.g. being sold a faulty car) as more likely than sad events (e.g. a good friend moving away).&lt;ref name="DeSteno et al (2000)"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who is angry tends to place more blame on another person for their misery. This can create a feedback, as this extra blame can make the angry person angrier still, so they in turn place yet more blame on the other person.

When people are in a certain emotional state, they tend to pay more attention to, or remember, things that are charged with the same emotion; so it is with anger. For instance, if you are trying to persuade someone that a tax increase is necessary, if the person is currently feeling angry you would do better to use an argument that elicits anger ("more criminals will escape justice") than, say, an argument that elicits sadness ("there will be fewer welfare benefits for disabled children").&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Also, unlike other negative emotions, which focus attention on all negative events, anger only focuses attention on anger-causing events.

Anger can make a person more desiring of an object to which his anger is tied. In a 2010 Dutch study, test subjects were primed to feel anger or fear by being shown an image of an angry or fearful face, and then were shown an image of a random object. When subjects were made to feel angry, they expressed more desire to possess that object than subjects who had been primed to feel fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101101151730.htm |title=Anger makes people want things more |doi=10.1177/0956797610384152 |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2010-11-01 |accessdate=2013-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expressive strategies==
As with any emotion, the display of anger can be feigned or [[exaggerated]]. Studies by Hochschild and Sutton have shown that the show of anger is likely to be an effective manipulation strategy in order to change and design attitudes. Anger is a distinct strategy of social influence and its use (i.e. belligerent behaviors) as a goal achievement mechanism proves to be a successful strategy.&lt;ref name="Sutton1"&gt;Sutton, R. I. ''Maintaining norms about expressed emotions: The case of bill collectors'', Administrative Science Quarterly, 1991, 36:245–268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hochschild1"&gt;Hochschild, AR, ''The managed heart: Commercialization of human feeling'', [[University of California Press]], 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Larissa Tiedens, known for her studies of anger, claimed that expression of feelings would cause a powerful influence not only on the [[perception]] of the expresser but also on their [[power position]] in the [[society]]. She studied the [[correlation]] between anger expression and social influence perception. Previous researchers, such as Keating, 1985 have found that people with angry face expression were perceived as powerful and as in a high [[social position]].&lt;ref name="Tiedens 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tiedens L. Z |title=Anger and advancement versus sadness and subjugation: the effect of negative emotion expressions on social status conferral |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11195894&amp;dopt=Citation |work=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=January 2001 |access-date=2015-11-27 |volume=80 |number=1 |pages=86–94 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.1.86 |pmid=11195894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Tiedens et al. have revealed that people who compared scenarios involving an angry and a sad character, attributed a higher [[social status]] to the angry character.&lt;ref name="Tiedens et al.,2000"/&gt; Tiedens examined in her study whether anger expression promotes status attribution. In other words, whether anger contributes to perceptions or legitimization of others' behaviors. Her findings clearly indicated that participants who were exposed to either an angry or a sad person were inclined to express support for the angry person rather than for a sad one. In addition, it was found that a reason for that decision originates from the fact that the person expressing anger was perceived as an ability owner, and was attributed a certain social status accordingly.&lt;ref name="Tiedens 2001"/&gt;

Showing anger during a negotiation may increase the ability of the anger expresser to succeed in [[negotiation]]. A study by Tiedens et al. indicated that the anger expressers were perceived as stubborn, dominant and powerful. In addition, it was found that people were inclined to easily give up to those who were perceived by them as powerful and stubborn, rather than soft and submissive.&lt;ref name="Tiedens et al.,2000"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tiedens |first=Ellsworth |last2=Tiedens |first2=Mesquita |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/26/5/560 |title=Sentimental Stereotypes: Emotional Expectations for High-and Low-Status Group Members |year=2000 |publisher=Psp.sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these findings Sinaceur and Tiedens have found that people conceded more to the angry side rather than for the non-angry one.&lt;ref&gt;M Sinaceur, LZ Tiedens, Get mad and get more than even: When and why anger expression is effective in negotiations, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A question raised by Van Kleef et al. based on these findings was whether expression of emotion influences others, since it is known that people use emotional information to conclude about others' limits and match their demands in negotiation accordingly. Van Kleef et al. wanted to explore whether people give up more easily to an angry opponent or to a happy opponent. Findings revealed that participants tended to be more flexible toward an angry opponent compared with a happy opponent. These results strengthen the argument that participants analyze the opponent's emotion to conclude about their limits and carry out their decisions accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Van Kleef, De Dreu and Manstead, ''The Interpersonal Effects of Anger and Happiness in Negotiations'', Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 2004, Vol. 86, No. 1, 57–76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coping strategies==
{{main|Anger management}}
According to Leland R. Beaumont, each instance of anger demands making a choice.&lt;ref&gt;Leland R. Beaumont, Emotional Competency, [http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/anger.htm#path Anger, An Urgent Plea for Justice and Action], Entry describing paths of anger&lt;/ref&gt; A person can respond with [[hostility|hostile]] action, including overt [[violence]], or they can respond with hostile inaction, such as withdrawing or stonewalling. Other options include initiating a dominance contest; harboring [[resentment]]; or working to better understand and constructively resolve the issue.

According to R. Novaco, there are a multitude of steps that were researched in attempting to deal with this emotion. In order to manage anger the problems involved in the anger should be discussed, Novaco suggests. The situations leading to anger should be explored by the person. The person is then tried to be imagery-based relieved of his or her recent angry experiences.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Novaco, R. (1975). Anger control: The development and evaluation of an experimental treatment. Lexington, MA: Heath.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional therapies for anger involve restructuring thoughts and beliefs to bring about a reduction in anger. These therapies often come within the schools of CBT (or [[Cognitive behavioural therapy|Cognitive Behavioural Therapies]]) like modern systems such as REBT ([[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]]). Research shows that people who suffer from excessive anger often harbor and act on dysfunctional [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]]s, assumptions and [[evaluation]]s in specific situations. It has been shown that with therapy by a trained professional, individuals can bring their anger to more manageable levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Beck |first=Richard |last2=Fernandez |first2=Ephrem |title=Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy in the Treatment of Anger: A Meta-Analysis |journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=63–74 |year=1998 |url=http://www.acu.edu/img/assets/6655/Cognitive-Behavioral%20in%20the%20Treatment%20of%20Anger%20(A%20Meta-analysis).pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905115446/http://www.acu.edu/img/assets/6655/Cognitive-Behavioral%20in%20the%20Treatment%20of%20Anger%20(A%20Meta-analysis).pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-05 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-02-05 |doi=10.1023/A:1018763902991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapy is followed by the so-called "stress inoculation" in which the clients are taught "relaxation skills to control their arousal and various cognitive controls to exercise on their attention, thoughts, images, and feelings. They are taught to see the provocation and the anger itself as occurring in a series of stages, each of which can be dealt with."&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;

The Skills-deficit model states that poor [[social skills]] is what renders a person incapable of expressing anger in an appropriate manner.&lt;ref&gt;Frederiksen, L.W., and Eisler, R.M. (1977). The control of explosive behavior: A skill development approach. In D. Upper (Ed.), Perspectives in Behavior Therapy. Kalamazoo, MI: Behaviordelia. Ranhiam, S., LeFebre, C., and Jenkins, J.O. 1980. The effects of social skills training on behavioral and cognitive components of anger management. Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, 11, 3–8.&lt;/ref&gt;
Social skills training has been found to be an effective method for reducing exaggerated anger by offering alternative coping skills to the angry individual. Research has found that persons who are prepared for aversive events find them less threatening, and excitatory reactions are significantly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Leventhal, H.. Emotions: A basic problem for social psychology. In C. Nemeth (Ed.), Social psychology: Classic and contemporary integrations. Chicago: Rand McNally, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1981 study, that used modeling, behavior rehearsal, and videotaped feedback to increase anger control skills, showed increases in anger control among aggressive youth in the study.&lt;ref&gt;Kolko, D.J., Dorsett, P.G., and Milan, M.

Aggression replacement training. Journal of Counseling and Development, 65, 356–361.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Research has also found that antisocial personalities are more likely to learn avoidance tasks when the consequences involved obtaining or losing tangible rewards. Learning among antisocial personalities also occurred better when they were involved with high intensity stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, D., Dorr, J., Walker &amp; J Bonner (eds.), New York:Norton (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; Social Learning Theory states that positive stimulation was not compatible with hostile or aggressive reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. Aggression:A social learning analysis. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Anger research has also studied the effects of reducing anger among adults with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), with a social skills program approach that used a low fear and high arousal group setting. This research found that low fear messages  were less provocative to the ASPD population, and high positive arousal stimulated their ability to concentrate, and subsequently learn new skills for anger reduction.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderlin, T.K., and Cellini, H.R., "Anger Management Intervention with Offender Populations". Offender Programs Report, Vol. 2. No. 4, November/December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive behavioral affective therapy===
A new integrative approach to anger treatment has been formulated by Ephrem Fernandez (2010)&lt;ref&gt;"Toward an Integrative Psychotherapy for Maladaptive Anger," ''International Handbook of Anger''.&lt;/ref&gt; Termed CBAT, for cognitive behavioral affective therapy, this treatment goes beyond conventional relaxation and reappraisal by adding cognitive and behavioral techniques and supplementing them with affective techniques to deal with the feeling of anger. The techniques are sequenced contingently in three phases of treatment: prevention, intervention, and postvention. In this way, people can be trained to deal with the onset of anger, its progression, and the residual features of anger.

===Suppression===
Modern psychologists point out that suppression of anger may have harmful effects. The suppressed anger may find another outlet, such as a physical symptom, or become more extreme.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Anger." Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology, 2nd ed. [[Thomson Gale|Gale Group]], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; John W. Fiero cites [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]] as an example of sudden, explosive release of suppressed anger. The anger was then displaced as violence against those who had nothing to do with the matter. There is also the case of [[Francine Hughes]], who suffered 13 years of domestic abuse. Her suppressed anger drove her to kill her abuser husband. It is claimed that a majority of female victims of domestic violence who suppress their aggressive feelings are unable to recognize, experience, and process negative emotion and this has a destabilizing influence on their perception of agency in their relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cupid's Knife: Women's Anger and Agency in Violent Relationships|last=Stein|first=Abby|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780415527866|location=New York|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of widespread deflection of anger from its actual cause toward [[scapegoating]], Fiero says, was the blaming of [[Jews]] for the economic ills of [[Germany]] by the [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref name="Ethics"/&gt; 

However, psychologists have also criticized the "catharsis theory" of aggression, which suggests that "unleashing" pent-up anger reduces aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Evidence against catharsis theory:

==Dual thresholds model==
Anger expression might have negative outcomes for individuals and organizations as well, such as decrease of productivity&lt;ref&gt;Jehn, K. A. 1995. A multimethod examination of the benefits and detriments of intragroup conflict. Administrative Science Quarterly, 40: 256–282.&lt;/ref&gt; and increase of job stress,&lt;ref&gt;Glomb, T. M. 2002. Workplace anger and aggression: Informing conceptual models with data from specific encounters. Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 7: 20–36.&lt;/ref&gt; however it could also have positive outcomes, such as increased work motivation, improved relationships, increased mutual understanding etc. (for ex. Tiedens, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Tiedens, L. Z. 2000. Powerful emotions: The vicious cycle of social status positions and emotions. In N. M. Ashkanasy, C. E. J. Ha¨ rtel, &amp; W. J. Zerbe (Eds.), Emotions in the workplace: Research, theory and practice: 71–81. Westport, CT: Quorum.&lt;/ref&gt; A Dual Thresholds Model of Anger in organizations by Geddes and Callister, (2007) provides an explanation on the valence of anger expression outcomes. The model suggests that organizational norms establish emotion thresholds that may be crossed when employees feel anger. The first "expression threshold" is crossed when an organizational member conveys felt anger to individuals at work who are associated with or able to address the anger-provoking situation. The second "impropriety threshold" is crossed if or when organizational members go too far while expressing anger such that observers and other company personnel find their actions socially and/or culturally inappropriate.

The higher probability of negative outcomes from workplace anger likely will occur in either of two situations. The first is when organizational members suppress rather than express their anger—that is, they fail to cross the "expression threshold". In this instance personnel who might be able to address or resolve the anger-provoking condition or event remain unaware of the problem, allowing it to continue, along with the affected individual's anger. The second is when organizational members cross both thresholds—"double cross"— displaying anger that is perceived as deviant. In such cases the angry person is seen as the problem—increasing chances of organizational sanctions against him or her while diverting attention away from the initial anger-provoking incident. In contrast, a higher probability of positive outcomes from workplace anger expression likely will occur when one's expressed anger stays in the space between the expression and impropriety thresholds. Here, one expresses anger in a way fellow organizational members find acceptable, prompting exchanges and discussions that may help resolve concerns to the satisfaction of all parties involved. This space between the thresholds varies among different organizations and also can be changed in organization itself: when the change is directed to support anger displays; the space between the thresholds will be expanded and when the change is directed to suppressing such displays; the space will be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Geddes, D. &amp; Callister, R. 2007 Crossing The Line(s): A Dual Threshold Model of Anger in Organizations, Academy of Management Review. 32 (3): 721–746.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominik|title=PSI: A Computational Architecture of Cognition, Motivation, and Emotion|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=2013|volume=17|issue=3|pages=297–317|doi=10.1037/a0032947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Resolution level
* Selection threshold
* Activation

'''Resolution level'''

Situations can be associated in terms of breadth and width so that information can be retrieved from the long-term memory and the PSI system can get ideas that vary with depending on the information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the resolution level was deep and wide more information could be retrieved, allowing the creation of more idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While if the resolution level was short and narrow lesser information is extracted, therefore creating fewer ideas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Selection Threshold'''

It allows the control of motivation, in way where you can focus on one motive or on a number at a given time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is very dependent on the activation parameter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The general threshold is around mid-level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; So, if the threshold was high the PSI focuses on the current motive while other needs become irrelevant or possess little interest to the individual at the time, but the individual will overlook all dangers and opportunities of the situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, if the threshold was lower, the individual will get distracted very easily and the motivations can vary at any given time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Activation'''

The level of competence is affected by the level of activation and can direct the individual to become ready for action or not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The general competence level is around mid-level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the activation on high the level of competence drops so that the individual becomes more action ready.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; So, when low the competence level is high, and the individual is not as ready to jump into action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Anger Regulation'''

The activation level will increase so that the individual becomes more action ready and, this in turn increases the selection threshold causing the individual to focus solely on the trigger.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The resolution level will drop so that perception and planning become low resulting in a quick action that may be risky and perhaps lead to aggression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Neuroscience]] has shown that emotions are generated by multiple structures in the [[Human brain|brain]]. The rapid, minimal, and evaluative processing of the emotional significance of the sensory data is done when the data passes through the [[amygdala]] in its travel from the [[Sense|sensory organs]] along certain [[neural pathway]]s towards the [[limbic]] [[forebrain]]. Emotion caused by discrimination of stimulus features, thoughts, or memories however occurs when its information is relayed from the [[thalamus]] to the [[neocortex]].&lt;ref name="Britannica11"/&gt; Based on some [[Statistics|statistical analysis]], some scholars have suggested that the tendency for anger may be [[Heredity|genetic]].

==Philosophical perspectives==
[[File:FLAXMAN John The Fury Of Athamas.jpg|thumb|right|''The Fury of [[Athamas]]'' by [[John Flaxman]] (1755–1826).]]

===Ancient history===
Ancient Greek philosophers, describing and commenting on the uncontrolled anger, particularly toward slaves, in their society generally showed a hostile attitude towards anger. [[Galen]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] regarded anger as a kind of madness. They all rejected the spontaneous, uncontrolled fits of anger and agreed on both the possibility and value of controlling anger. There were however disagreements regarding the value of anger. For Seneca, anger was "worthless even for war." Seneca believed that the disciplined Roman army was regularly able to beat the Germans, who were known for their fury. He argued that "...&amp;nbsp;in sporting contests, it is a mistake to become angry".&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;

[[Aristotle]] on the other hand, ascribed some value to anger that has arisen from perceived injustice because it is useful for preventing injustice.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Aristotle: "The person who is angry at the right things and toward the right people, and also in the right way, at the right time and for the right length of time is morally praiseworthy." cf. Paul M. Hughes, ''Anger'', Encyclopedia of Ethics, Vol I, Second Edition, Rutledge Press&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the opposite of anger is a kind of insensibility, Aristotle stated.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; The difference in people's temperaments was generally viewed as a result of the different mix of qualities or humors people contained. Seneca held that "red-haired and red-faced people are hot-tempered because of excessive hot and dry humors."&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; Ancient philosophers rarely refer to women's anger at all, according to Simon Kemp and K. T. Strongman perhaps because their works were not intended for women. Some of them that discuss it, such as Seneca, considered women to be more prone to anger than men.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;

====Control methods====
{{wikisource|Of Anger}}
[[Seneca the younger|Seneca]] addresses the question of mastering anger in three parts: 1. how to avoid becoming angry in the first place 2. how to cease being angry and 3. how to deal with anger in others.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; Seneca suggests, to avoid becoming angry in the first place, that the many faults of anger should be repeatedly remembered. One should avoid being too busy or deal with anger-provoking people. Unnecessary hunger or thirst should be avoided and soothing music be listened to.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; To cease being angry, Seneca suggests "one to check speech and impulses and be aware of particular sources of personal irritation. In dealing with other people, one should not be too inquisitive: It is not always soothing to hear and see everything. When someone appears to slight you, you should be at first reluctant to believe this, and should wait to hear the full story. You should also put yourself in the place of the other person, trying to understand his motives and any extenuating factors, such as age or illness."&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; Seneca further advises daily self-inquisition about one's [[Behavioral addiction|bad habit]].&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; To deal with anger in others, Seneca suggests that the best reaction is to simply keep calm. A certain kind of deception, Seneca says, is necessary in dealing with angry people.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;

Galen repeats Seneca's points but adds a new one: finding a guide and teacher can help the person in controlling their passions. Galen also gives some hints for finding a good teacher.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; Both Seneca and Galen (and later philosophers) agree that the process of controlling anger should start in childhood on grounds of malleability. Seneca warns that this education should not blunt the spirit of the children nor should they be humiliated or treated severely. At the same time, they should not be pampered. Children, Seneca says, should learn not to beat their playmates and not to become angry with them. Seneca also advises that children's requests should not be granted when they are angry.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;

===Post-classical history===
{{See also|The four humours}}
During the period of the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Middle Ages]], philosophers elaborated on the existing conception of anger, many of whom did not make major contributions to the concept. For example, many medieval philosophers such as [[Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Roger Bacon]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] agreed with ancient philosophers that animals cannot become angry.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; On the other hand, [[al-Ghazali]] (Algazel), who often disagreed with Aristotle and Ibn Sina on many issues, argued that animals do possess anger as one of the three "powers" in their [[Qalb|heart]], the other two being [[appetite]] and [[Impulse (psychology)|impulse]]. He also argued that animal [[Will (philosophy)|will]] is "conditioned by anger and appetite" in contrast to human will which is "conditioned by the [[Intelligence|intellect]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Amber |last=Haque |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357–377 [367] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common medieval belief was that those prone to anger had an excess of yellow bile or choler (hence the word "choleric").&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; This belief was related to Seneca's belief that "red-haired and red-faced people are hot-tempered because of excessive hot and dry humors."

;By gender
Wrath was sinful because of the social problems it caused, sometimes even homicide. It served to ignore those who are present, contradicts those who are absent, produces insults, and responds harshly to insults that are received.&lt;ref&gt;In the Garden of Evil: Vices and Culture in the Middle Ages. Richard Newhauser. PIMS, 200&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle felt that anger or wrath was a natural outburst of self- defense in situations where people felt they had been wronged. Aquinas felt that if anger was justified, it was not a sin. For example, "He that is angry without cause, shall be in danger; but he that is angry with cause, shall not be in danger: for without anger, teaching will be useless, judgments unstable, crimes unchecked. Therefore to be angry is not always an evil."&lt;ref&gt;St. Thomas Aquinas Blackfriars; McGraw-Hill, N. Y. K. 1963, Question 158&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of wrath contributed to a definition of gender and power. Many medieval authors in 1200 agreed the differences between men and women were based on complexion, shape, and disposition. Complexion involved the balance of the four fundamental qualities of heat, coldness, moistness, and dryness. When various combinations of these qualities are made they define groups of certain people as well as individuals. Hippocrates, Aristotle, and Galen all agreed on that, in terms of biology and sexual differentiation, heat was the most important of the qualities because it determined shape and disposition. Disposition included a balance of the previous four qualities, the four elements and the four humors. For example, the element of fire shared the qualities of heat and dryness: fire dominated in yellow bile or choler, meaning a choleric person was more or hot and dry than others. Hot and dry individuals were active, dominant, and aggressive. The opposite was true with the element of water. Water, is cold and moist, related closely to phlegm: people with more phlegmatic personalities were passive and submissive. While these trait clusters varied from individual to individual most authors in the Middle Ages assumed certain clusters of traits characterized men more than women and vice versa.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;In the Garden of Evil: Vices and Culture in the Middle Ages. Richard Newhauser. PIMS, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

;Women
Scholars posted that females were seen by authors in the Middle Ages to be more phlegmatic (cold and wet) than males, meaning females were more sedentary and passive than males.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; Women's passive nature appeared "natural" due to their lack of power when compared to men. Aristotle identified traits he believed women shared: female, feminine, passive, focused on matter, inactive, and inferior. Thus medieval women were supposed to act submissively toward men and relinquish control to their husbands.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; However [[Hildegard of Bingen]] believed women were fully capable of anger. While most women were phlegmatic, individual women under certain circumstances could also be choleric.

;Men
Medieval scholars believed most men were choleric, or hot and dry. Thus they were dominant and aggressive. (Barton) Aristotle also identified characteristics of men: male, masculine, active, focused on form, potent, outstanding, and superior. Men were aware of the power they held. Given their choleric "nature", men exhibited hot temperatures and were quick to anger.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; [[Peter of Albano]] once said, "The male's spirit, is lively, given to violent impulse; [it is] slow getting angry and slower being calmed." Medieval ideas of gender assumed men were more rational than women. Masculinity involved a wide range of possible behaviors, and men were not angry all the time. Every man's [[humorism|humoral]] balance was different, some men were strong, other weak, also some more prone to wrath then others.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; There are those who view anger as a manly act. For instance, David Brakke maintained:&lt;blockquote&gt;because anger motivated a man to action in righting wrongs to himself and others, because its opposite appeared to be passivity in the face of challenges from other males, because - to put it simply - it raised the body's temperature, anger appeared to be a characteristic of masculinity, a sign that a man was indeed a manly man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behold the Man: Jesus and Greco-Roman Masculinity|last=Conway|first=Colleen|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780195325324|location=New York|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Control methods====
[[Maimonides]] considered being given to uncontrollable passions as a kind of illness. Like Galen, Maimonides suggested seeking out a philosopher for curing this illness just as one seeks out a physician for curing bodily illnesses. Roger Bacon elaborates Seneca's advices. Many medieval writers discuss at length the evils of anger and the virtues of temperance. In a discussion of [[Confession (religion)|confession]], [[John Mirk]], an English 14th-century [[Augustinian]] writer, tells priests how to advise the [[penance|penitent]] by considering the spiritual and social consequences of anger:&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;

In ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'', [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna) modified the theory of [[temperament]]s and argued that anger heralded the transition of [[melancholia]] to mania, and explained that [[humidity]] inside the head can contribute to such [[mood disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Amber |last=Haque |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357–377 [366] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

On the other hand, [[Ahmed ibn Sahl al-Balkhi]] classified anger (along with aggression) as a type of [[neurosis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Amber |last=Haque |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357–377 [362] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Modern history===
The modern understanding of anger may not be greatly advanced over that of Aristotle.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] rejects revenge as vicious. Regarding the latter, [[David Hume]] argues that because "anger and [[hatred]] are passions inherent in our very frame and constitution, the lack of them is sometimes evidence of weakness and imbecility."&lt;ref name="EoE"/&gt; Two main differences between the modern understanding and ancient understanding of anger can be detected, Kemp and Strongman state: one is that early philosophers were not concerned with possible harmful effects of the [[Anger#Suppression|suppression of anger]]; the other is that, recently, studies of anger take the issue of [[gender differences]] into account. The latter does not seem to have been of much concern to earlier philosophers.&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"/&gt;

The American psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] has suggested that anger, rage, and fury partly have roots in the philosophical meanings and assumptions through which human beings interpret [[wikt:transgression|transgression]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Albert (2001). Overcoming Destructive Beliefs, Feelings, and Behaviors: New Directions for Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. [[Prometheus Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ellis, these emotions are often associated and related to the leaning humans have to absolutistically depreciating and damning other peoples' humanity when their personal rules and domain are transgressed.

==Religious perspectives==

===Judaism===
{{Main|Anger in Judaism}}
In [[Judaism]], anger is a negative trait. In the [[Book of Genesis]], [[Jacob]] condemned the anger that had arisen in his sons Simon and Levi: "Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel."&lt;ref name="Jewish"&gt;[[Kaufmann Kohler]], [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1523&amp;letter=A Anger], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Restraining oneself from anger is seen as noble and desirable, as [[Ethics of the Fathers]] states:

"[[Ben Zoma]] said:
Who is strong? He who subdues his evil inclination, as it is stated,
'He who is slow to anger is better than a strong man, and he who masters his passions is better than one who conquers a city' (Proverbs 16:32)."&lt;ref&gt;Ethics of the Fathers 4:1&lt;/ref&gt;

Maimonides rules that one who becomes angry is as though that person had worshipped idols.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam, Hilchot de'ot 2&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] explains that the parallel between anger and idol worship is that by becoming angry, one shows a disregard of [[Divine Providence]] – whatever had caused the anger was ultimately ordained from Above – and that through coming to anger one thereby denies the hand of [[God]] in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Sefer HaTanya, p. 535&lt;/ref&gt;

In its section dealing with ethical traits a person should adopt, the ''[[Shlomo Ganzfried#Kitzur Shulchan Aruch|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]]'' states: "Anger is also a very evil trait and it should be avoided at all costs. You should train yourself not to become angry even if you have a good reason to be angry."&lt;ref&gt;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 29:4&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern writings, Rabbi [[Harold Kushner]] finds no grounds for anger toward God because "our misfortunes are none of His doing."&lt;ref&gt;Harold S. Kushner, ''When Bad Things Happen to Good People'' (Schocken Books, 1981), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Kushner's reading of the [[Bible]], David Blumenthal finds an "abusing God" whose "sometimes evil" actions evoke vigorous protest, but without severing the protester's relationship with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Blumenthal |title=Facing the Abusing God: A Theology of Protest (Westminster/John Knox, 1993) |page=223 |url=http://religion.emory.edu/faculty/blumenthal.html |publisher=Religion.emory.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115041028/http://religion.emory.edu/faculty/blumenthal.html |archivedate=2014-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
Both [[Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] writers have addressed anger.

====Catholic====
[[File:Boschsevendeadlysins.jpg|thumb|''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'', by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] (1485). "Wrath" is depicted at the bottom in a series of circular images. Below the image is the [[Latin]] inscription ''Cave Cave Deus Videt'' ("Beware, Beware, God is Watching").]]
[[File:Rage-and-anger-fresco.jpg|thumb|[[Angel]] with [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]] and [[Humility]] [[virtue]]s versus [[Devil]] with [[Rage (emotion)|Rage]] and Wrath [[sins]]. A fresco from the 1717 Saint Nicolas [[Orthodox church]] in Cukovets, [[Pernik Province]], [[Bulgaria]]]]

Wrath is one of the Seven Deadly Sins in Catholicism; and yet the Catechism of the Catholic Church states (canons 1772 and 1773) that anger is among the passions, and that "in the passions, as movements of the sensitive appetite, there is neither good nor evil." The neutral act of anger becomes the sin of wrath when it's directed against an innocent person, when it's unduly unbending or long-lasting, or when it desires excessive punishment. "If anger reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or seriously wound a neighbor, it is gravely against charity; it is a mortal sin." (CCC 2302) Hatred is the sin of desiring that someone else may suffer misfortune or evil, and is a mortal sin when one desires grave harm. (CCC 2302-03)

[[History of Christianity|Medieval Christianity]] vigorously denounced wrath as one of the seven cardinal, or [[Seven Deadly Sins|deadly sins]], but some Christian writers at times regarded the anger caused by injustice as having some value.&lt;ref name="Ethics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AngerTheory"&gt;Simon Kemp, K.T. Strongman, ''Anger theory and management: A historical analysis'', The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 108, No. 3. (Autumn, 1995), pp. 397–417&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil]] viewed anger as a "reprehensible temporary madness."&lt;ref name="Ethics"/&gt; Joseph F. Delany in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] (1914) defines anger as "the desire of vengeance" and states that a reasonable vengeance and passion is ethical and praiseworthy. Vengeance is sinful when it exceeds its limits in which case it becomes opposed to justice and charity. For example, "vengeance upon one who has not deserved it, or to a greater extent than it has been deserved, or in conflict with the dispositions of law, or from an improper motive" are all sinful. An unduly vehement vengeance is considered a [[venial sin]] unless it seriously goes counter to the love of God or of one's neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Anger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more positive view of anger is espoused by Roman Catholic pastoral theologian [[Henri Nouwen|Henri J. M. Nouwen]]. Father Nouwen points to the spiritual benefits in anger toward God as found in both the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]]. In the Bible, says Father Nouwen, "it is clear that only by expressing our anger and hatred directly to God will we come to know the fullness of both his love and our freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Henri J. M. Nouwen, "Forward" in ''May I Hate God?'' Pierre Wolff, 2 (Paulist Press, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Bernanos]] illustrates Nouwen's position in his novel ''The Diary of a Country Priest''. The countess gave birth to the son she had long wanted, but the child died. She was fiercely angry. When the priest called, the countess vented her anger toward her daughter and husband, then at the priest who responded gently, "open your heart to [God]." The countess rejoined, "I've ceased to bother about God. When you've forced me to admit that I hate Him, will you be any better off?" The priest continued, "you no longer hate Him. Hate is indifference and contempt. Now at last you're face to face with Him&amp;nbsp;... Shake your fist at Him, spit in His face, scourge Him." The countess did what the priest counseled. By confessing her hate, she was enabled to say, "all's well."&lt;ref&gt;Georges Bernanos, ''The Diary of a Country Priest'' (London: Fontana Books, 1956), 126–150 passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protestant====
Everyone experiences anger, Andrew D. Lester observes, and furthermore anger can serve as "a spiritual friend, a spiritual guide, and a spiritual ally." Denying and suppressing anger is contrary to [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul's]] admonition in his [[Epistle to the Ephesians]] 4:26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew D. |last=Lester |title=Anger: Discovering Your Spiritual Ally - (Westminster John Knox, 2007) |pages=11–12 |url=http://www.acpe.edu/NewPDF/Andy%20Lester%20Tribute.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Acpe.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017044703/http://www.acpe.edu/NewPDF/Andy%20Lester%20Tribute.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When anger toward God is denied and suppressed, it interferes with an individual's relation with God. However, expressing one's anger toward God can deepen the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew D. |last=Lester |title=Coping with Your Anger: A Christian Guide - (Westminster John Knox, 1983) |pages=92–94 |url=http://www.acpe.edu/NewPDF/Andy%20Lester%20Tribute.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Acpe.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017044703/http://www.acpe.edu/NewPDF/Andy%20Lester%20Tribute.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. FitzSimons Allison]] holds that "we worship God by expressing our honest anger at him."&lt;ref&gt;C.

[[Bible|Biblical]] scholar Leonard Pine concludes from his studies in the [[Book of Habakkuk]] that "far from being a sin, proper remonstration with God is the activity of a healthy faith relationship with Him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Leonard |last=Pine |title=Remonstrating with God in Adversity: A Study in Habakkuk |journal=WRS |volume=3:1 (February 1996) 21–26 |url=http://www.wrs.edu/about/faculty-and-staff/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other biblical examples of anger toward God include the following:&lt;ref&gt;[[New Revised Standard Version]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Moses]] was angry with God for mistreating his people: "Lord, why have you mistreated [''lit.'' done evil to] this people?" ([[Book of Exodus]] 5:22).
* [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]] was angry with God after the death of her husband and two sons: "The Almighty has dealt bitterly with me. The Almighty has brought calamity upon me" ([[Book of Ruth]] 1:20–21 ''abr'').
* [[Elijah]] was angry with God after the son of the widow died: "O Lord my God, have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son?" ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 17:20).
* [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] was angry with God: "You have turned cruel to me; with the might of your hand you persecute me" ([[Book of Job]] 30:21).
* [[Jeremiah]] was angry with God for deceiving his people: "Ah, Lord God, how utterly you have deceived this people and Jerusalem." ([[Book of Jeremiah]] 4:10).

===Hinduism===
In [[Hinduism]], anger is equated with sorrow as a form of unrequited desire. The objects of anger are perceived as a hindrance to the gratification of the desires of the angry person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part22/chap11.htm Anger (HinduDharma: Dharmas Common To All)], Shri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively if one thinks one is superior, the result is grief. Anger is considered to be packed with more evil power than desire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/2004/7-9/40-49_anger.shtml Anger Management: How to Tame our Deadliest Emotion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121213147/http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/2004/7-9/40-49_anger.shtml |date=2008-01-21 }}, by Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bhagavad Gita]] [[Krishna]] regards greed, anger, and lust as signs of ignorance and leads to perpetual bondage. As for the agitations of the bickering mind, they are divided into two divisions. The first is called avirodha-prīti, or unrestricted attachment, and the other is called virodha-yukta-krodha, anger arising from frustration. Adherence to the philosophy of the Māyāvādīs, belief in the fruitive results of the karma-vādīs, and belief in plans based on materialistic desires are called avirodha-prīti. (Reference needed)

Jñānīs, karmīs and materialistic planmakers generally attract the attention of conditioned souls, but when the materialists cannot fulfill their plans and when their devices are frustrated, they become angry. Frustration of material desires produces anger.&lt;ref&gt;The Nectar of Instruction 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Overquotation|section|date=December 2017}}
Anger is defined in [[Buddhism]] as: "being unable to bear the object, or the intention to cause harm to the object." Anger is seen as aversion with a stronger exaggeration, and is listed as one of the [[five hindrances]]. Buddhist monks, such as [[Dalai Lama]], the spiritual leader of Tibetans in exile, sometimes get angry.&lt;ref name="urbandharma"&gt;[http://www.urbandharma.org/udnl2/nl030904.html The Urban Dharma Newsletter], March 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a difference; most often a spiritual person is aware of the emotion and the way it can be handled. Thus, in response to the question: "Is any anger acceptable in Buddhism?' the Dalai Lama answered:&lt;ref name="urbandharma"/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Buddhism in general teaches that anger is a destructive emotion and although anger might have some positive effects in terms of survival or moral outrage, I do not accept that anger of any kind as ''(sic)'' a virtuous emotion nor aggression as constructive behavior. The [[Gautama Buddha]] ''(sic)'' has taught that there are three basic [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]] at the root of [[samsara]] (bondage, illusion) and the vicious cycle of rebirth. These are greed, hatred, and delusion—also translatable as attachment, anger, and ignorance. They bring us confusion and misery rather than peace, happiness, and fulfillment. It is in our own self-interest to purify and transform them. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Buddhist scholar and author Geshe [[Kelsang Gyatso]] has also explained [[Buddha]]'s teaching on the spiritual imperative to identify anger and overcome it by transforming difficulties:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0978906713 How to Solve our Human Problems], Tharpa Publications (2005, US ed., 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-9789067-1-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When things go wrong in our life and we encounter difficult situations, we tend to regard the situation itself as our problem, but in reality whatever problems we experience come from the side of the mind. If we responded to difficult situations with a positive or peaceful mind they would not be problems for us. Eventually, we might even regard them as challenges or opportunities for growth and development. Problems arise only if we respond to difficulties with a negative state of mind. Therefore if we want to be free from problems, we must transform our mind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Buddha himself on anger:&lt;ref name="Kodhana Sutta"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an07/an07.060.than.html "Kodhana Sutta: An Angry Person"(AN 7.60), translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu. Access to Insight], June 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
An angry person is ugly &amp; sleeps poorly. Gaining a profit, he turns it into a loss, having done damage with word &amp; deed. A person overwhelmed with anger destroys his wealth. Maddened with anger, he destroys his status. Relatives, friends, &amp; colleagues avoid him. Anger brings loss. Anger inflames the mind. He doesn't realize that his danger is born from within. An angry person doesn't know his own benefit. An angry person doesn't see the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]]. A man conquered by anger is in a mass of darkness. He takes pleasure in bad deeds as if they were good, but later, when his anger is gone, he suffers as if burned with fire. He is spoiled, blotted out, like fire enveloped in smoke. When anger spreads, when a man becomes angry, he has no shame, no fear of evil, is not respectful in speech. For a person overcome with anger, nothing gives light.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Islam===
A verse in the third [[surah]] of the Quran instructs people to restrain their anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|3|134|t=a|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anger (Arabic:غضب, ''ghadab'') in Islam is considered to be instigated by Satan (''[[Devil (Islam)|Shaitan]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Muhaiyaddeen |first=M. R. Bawa |title=Islam &amp; World Peace: Explanations of a Sufi |page=64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8grB4SKJrXsC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64|isbn=9780914390657 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors stated to lead to anger include selfishness, arrogance and excessive ambition.&lt;ref name="Path"&gt;{{cite book |last=Efendi |first=Birgivî Mehmet |last2=Bayrak |first2=Tosun |title=The Path Of Muhammad: A Book On Islamic Morals And Ethics |page=182 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GLFZ8f8trUgC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182|isbn=9780941532686 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic teachings also state that anger hinders the faith (''[[iman (concept)|iman]]'') of a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first=Kınalızade Ali |last=Çelebi |first2=Muḥammad ibn Muṣṭafá |last2=Khādimī |title=Ethics of Islam |page=128 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WQP-Nhmq6VIC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128|year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran attributes anger to [[Prophets in Islam|prophets]] and believers as well as Muhammad's enemies. It mentions the anger of Moses (''[[Islamic view of Moses|Musa]]'') against his people for worshiping a [[golden calf]] and at the moment when Moses strikes an Egyptian for fighting against an Israelite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|7|150|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anger of Jonah (''[[Islamic view of Jonah|Yunus]]'') is also mentioned in the Quran, which led to his departure from the people of [[Nineveh]] and his eventual realization of his error and his repentance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|21|87|e=88|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of anger from the hearts of believers by [[God in Islam|God]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: [[Allah|{{Rtl-lang|ar|الله}}]] ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Allāh}}'') after the fighting against [[Muhammad]]'s enemies is over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|9|15|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AngerQ"/&gt; In general, suppression of anger (Arabic: کاظم, ''kazm'') is deemed a praiseworthy quality in the hadis.&lt;ref name="AngerQ"&gt;Bashir, Shahzad. ''Anger'', [[Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an]], Brill, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|bukhari|8|73|135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Abu-Nimer, ''Non-Violence, Peacebuilding, Conflict Resolution and Human Rights in Islam:A Framework for Nonviolence and Peacebuilding in Islam'', Journal of Law and Religion, Vol. 15, No. 1/2. (2000–2001), pp. 217–265.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yusuf ibn abd al-Barr|Ibn Abdil Barr]], the Andalusian Maliki jurist explains that controlling anger is the door way for restraining other blameworthy traits ego and envy, since these two are less powerful than anger. The hadis state various ways to diminish, prevent and control anger. One of these methods is to perform a [[wudu|ritual ablution]], a different narration states that the angry person should lie down and other narrations instructs the angry person to invoke God and seek refuge from the Devil, by reciting ''I take refuge with Allah/God from the accursed Devil.''

It has also been stated by the Imam Ali, the "Commander of the faithful" and the son-in-law of prophet Muhammad that "A moment of patience in a moment of anger saves a thousand moments of regret." As well as "Anger begins with madness, and ends in regret."&lt;ref name="Path"/&gt;

===Divine retribution===
[[File:John Martin - The Great Day of His Wrath - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Great Day of His Wrath]]'', by [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] (1789–1854).]]
In many religions, anger is frequently attributed to God or gods. Primitive people held that gods were subject to anger and revenge in anthropomorphic fashion.&lt;ref name="DictionaryofR"/&gt; [[Hebrew Bible|The Hebrew Bible]] says that opposition to God's Will results in God's anger.&lt;ref name="DictionaryofR"&gt;Shailer Mathews, Gerald Birney Smith, A Dictionary of Religion and Ethics, Kessinger Publishing, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] [[rabbi]] Kaufmann Kohler explains:&lt;ref name="Jewish"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;God is not an intellectual abstraction, nor is He conceived as a being indifferent to the doings of man; and His pure and lofty nature resents most energetically anything wrong and impure in the moral world: "O Lord, my God, mine Holy One&amp;nbsp;... Thou art of eyes too pure to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity."&lt;/blockquote&gt; Christians believe in God's anger at the sight of evil. This anger is not inconsistent with God's love, as demonstrated in the Gospel where the righteous indignation of Christ is shown in the [[Cleansing of the Temple]]. Christians believe that those who reject His revealed Word, Jesus, condemn themselves, and are not condemned by the [[Divine retribution|wrath of God]].&lt;ref name="DictionaryofR"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3833">'''Anna Livia Löwendahl-Atomic''' is an artist.

Born in [[Stockholm]] in [[Sweden]], Löwendahl-Atomic studied in England at [[Chelsea College of Art and Design]] in [[London]], graduating in 1995. She is best known for ''A Selection of Interesting Secrets from Various Stages in my Life'', a conceptual artwork in which Löwendahl-Atomic sells her secrets one by one, the buyer having to sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] to the effect that he or she can never reveal the secret to anyone.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|last=Wade|first=Alex|title=Can You Own An Idea?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/may/06/art.artsfeatures|work=The Guardian|accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The work was exhibited at the [[Uppsala Art Museum]] in Sweden in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Lydiate, [http://www.artquest.org.uk/articles/view/art_and_the_law ''Art Monthly'', Dec 2000, p61] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018191615/http://www.artquest.org.uk/articles/view/art_and_the_law |date=October 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Livia has also exhibited with [[Decima gallery]].

In 2003 a dispute over an alleged relationship between Löwendahl-Atomic's earlier work and a later work by another conceptual artist, [[Carey Young]], shortlisted for the [[Beck's Futures]] prize arose. Young's contribution to the show was entitled Non-Disclosure Agreement. The exhibition sponsor had to sign a non-disclosure agreement promising not to tell about an art work by her which only he has seen. Young denied copying Löwendahl-Atomic's work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2984655.stm BBC News 24 website, Tuesday April 29, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowendahl-Atomic also uses the name Ana Dinextra for her work as a vocalist and lyricist.  In 2007 she founded the [[Art rock]] band [http://www.whereeverythingfallsout.com Where Everything Falls Out]” together with the Swedish composer Kenneth Cosimo. They have since started a collaboration with  [[Graham Lewis]], bassist and vocalist in the legendary art combo [[Wire (band)|Wire]].

In 2009, Lowendahl-Atomic established The Muesum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Muesum|url=https://themuesum.org|website=The Muesum|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she has installed in different locations around the world and is an ongoing project.

She has never knowingly brought a round when frequenting a public house.

{{Tort law}}
'''Assumption of risk''' is a [[defense (legal)|defense]] in the [[law]] of [[tort]]s, which bars or reduces a [[plaintiff]]'s right to recovery against a negligent [[tortfeasor]] if the [[defendant]] can demonstrate that the plaintiff voluntarily and knowingly assumed the risks at issue inherent to the dangerous activity in which he was participating at the time of his or her injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vargo|first1=John F.|title=Comparative Fault: A Need for Reform of Indiana Tort Law|journal=Indiana Law Review|date=1978|volume=11|page=832|url=https://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/inlawrev/article/viewFile/2310/2192|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is usually meant by assumption of risk is more precisely termed ''primary'' or "express" assumption of risk. It occurs when the plaintiff has either expressly or implicitly relieved the defendant of the [[duty]] to mitigate or relieve the risk causing the injury from which the cause of action arises. It operates as a complete bar to liability on the theory that upon assumption of the risk, there is no longer a [[duty of care]] running from the defendant to the plaintiff; without a duty owed by the defendant, there can be no negligence on his part.&lt;ref&gt;''Knight v. Jewett'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/3C4t296.htm 3 Cal. 4th 296], 314-315 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, primary assumption of risk is not a blanket exemption from liability for the operators of a dangerous activity.  The ''specific'' risk causing the injury must have been known to, and appreciated by, the plaintiff in order for primary assumption of risk to apply.  Also, assumption of risk does not absolve a defendant of liability for reckless conduct.&lt;ref&gt;''Cheong v. Antablin'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/16C4t1063.htm 16 Cal. 4th 1067] (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  

This defense is commonly asserted in cases of injuries occurring during risky recreational activities, such as skiing, paragliding, and scuba diving, but actually extends to all dangerous activities.  Thus, for example, it was held that a visitor to the [[Burning Man]] festival assumed the risk of getting [[burn]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;''Beninati v. Black Rock City, LLC'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA4/175CA4t650.htm 175 Cal. App. 4th 650] (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Secondary'' assumption of risk is a rather different doctrine akin in some respects to [[comparative negligence]]. The difference was explained by the Supreme Court of California as follows: 

{{cquote|In cases involving 'primary assumption of risk'—where, by virtue of the nature of the activity and the parties' relationship to the activity, the defendant owes no legal duty to protect the plaintiff from the particular risk of harm that caused the injury—the doctrine continues to operate as a complete bar to the plaintiff's recovery. In cases involving 'secondary assumption of risk'—where the defendant does owe a duty of care to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff proceeds to encounter a known risk imposed by the defendant's breach of duty—the doctrine is merged into the comparative fault scheme, and the trier of fact, in apportioning the loss resulting from the injury, may consider the relative responsibility of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;''Knight'', 3 Cal. 4th at 314-315.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Austin Museum of Digital Art''' ('''AMODA'''), located in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]], is the first [[museum]] dedicated exclusively to the display of [[digital art]]. AMODA was founded in 1997 by Harold Chaput, Samantha Krukowski and Chris Rankin in response to the abundance of digital art in the local scene and the absence of venues for such art. AMODA has not only presented local artwork, but has brought digital art and digital artists from around the globe to Austin. By putting local and global works and acts next to each other, AMODA has contributed to the already growing digital art and music scene in Austin, while gaining recognition around the world as an important museum that has shaped the definition of digital art.

==History==
The Austin Museum of Digital Art is the brainchild of Harold Chaput, then a Computer Sciences doctoral student at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and Christopher Rankin, an art history graduate of [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] and experienced museum worker. Rankin was dissatisfied with the state of the contemporary art scene in Austin. Chaput was connected to many artists and musicians employed in high tech positions who were looking for a creative outlet. By establishing an organization with the goals of supporting the production and exhibition of new work and encouraging discussion about the role of technology in current contemporary art, Chaput and Rankin hoped that they could encourage a community of artists, musicians, and technologists to create cutting-edge digital-based contemporary art.

They joined up with Samantha Krukowski, an influential member of UT's communications department. The three of them swiftly settled on a subsection of contemporary art that used computers in some form, and coined the term Digital Art to describe it. They also agreed that the new organization should be a museum rather than a collective or a gallery, placing the emphasis on artistry and aesthetics rather than fashion and popularity. Thus the Austin Museum of Digital Art was founded in November 1997.

Shortly after its founding, Rankin left AMODA because his new job working for the Texas Commission on the Arts posed a conflict of interest. Krukowski also left to become a Professor of Communications at UT. Rankin and Krukowski were replaced Kyle Anderson, Jennifer Potter, Joel Stearns and Robert Turknett. Together with Chaput, this board moved AMODA from a museum on paper to an art institution. They created AMODA's programs, including an educational program (2000), the Digital Showcase (2001), an exhibition series (2002), and a performance series (2003).

==Defining Digital Art==
AMODA defines Digital Art as art that uses digital technology in one of three ways: product, process or subject.

Art that uses digital technology as the product can be considered digital art. This includes categories like "web art" or "demo art." This is the most recognized definition of digital art.

Art that uses digital technology in the process of creation can also be considered digital art. The drawings of [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]]'s [[AARON]] are digital art because a computer program was used to generate the works, even though the final product is ink on paper. Computer graphics on film, digital music, and the [[Cyberopera]] are all good examples of digital art as process.

Finally, art that references digital art as its subject can also be considered digital art. A series of oil paintings showing a man connected to an online chat room could be categorized as digital art, even though digital technology was never used in the creation or display of the work.

The central theme for all three approaches is: art that could not have been created without digital technology. All three address different facets of digital art, from presentation to technique to sociology, all of which are important to the history of art.

==Programming==
AMODA's programming was designed to be accessible without being condescending. It was unique in its ability to draw a younger audience than other museums and galleries could. AMODA's programs were integrated with the community and attracted a new population of art patrons through its non-traditional but high-quality presentation of digital art.

AMODA's most popular and successful programs were its Exhibition Series and Digital Showcase.

===Digital Showcase===
The AMODA Digital Showcase is a monthly evening of digital art and music. Under the strict direction of Todd Simmons, a performance space is filled with digital art installations, and four to six digital music performances are shown throughout the evening.

The intention of the Digital Showcase is to show digital art ''in situ''. While an exhibition removes art from its natural environment and displays it for isolated examination, the Digital Showcase lets the different art installations and music performances bleed over each other. The result is an immersive art experience where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It is also wildly popular. Attendance is consistently in the hundreds, and the performances have been written up internationally.

{{Marxism|Variants}}
'''Autonomism''' (also '''authonomous Marxism''' or '''autonomist Marxism''') is a set of [[anti-authoritarian]] [[left-wing]] political and social movements and theories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1342334/AUTONOMISM_AS_A_GLOBAL_SOCIAL_MOVEMENT "Autonomism as a global social movement" by Patrick Cuninghame].

Sylvere Lotringer &amp; Christian Marazzi. New York: Semiotext(e), 1980, 2007. {{ISBN|1-58435-053-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58435-053-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a theoretical system, it first emerged in [[History of the Italian Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Later, [[Post-Marxism|post-Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian [[far-left]] movements in the 1970s, and the emergence of a number of important theorists including [[Antonio Negri]], who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'', as well as [[Mario Tronti]], [[Paolo Virno]] and [[Franco Berardi|Franco "Bifo" Berardi]].

Georgy Katsiaficas summarizes the forms of autonomous movements saying that "In contrast to the centralized decisions and [[hierarchical]] [[Anti-authoritarianism|authority]] structures of modern institutions, autonomous social movements involve people directly in decisions affecting their everyday lives. They seek to expand democracy and to help individuals break free of political structures and behavior patterns imposed from the outside."&lt;ref&gt;Georgy Katsiaficas. ''The Subversion of Politics: European Autonomous Social Movements and the Decolonization of Everyday Life''. AK Press. 2006. pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt; As such this has involved a call for the independence of social movements from political parties&lt;ref&gt;Georgy Katsiaficas. ''The Subversion of Politics: European Autonomous Social Movements and the Decolonization of Everyday Life''. AK Press. 2006. pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt; in a revolutionary perspective which seeks to create a practical political alternative to both [[State socialism|authoritarian socialism]] and contemporary [[representative democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Georgy Katsiaficas. ''The Subversion of Politics: European Autonomous Social Movements and the Decolonization of Everyday Life''. AK Press. 2006. pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Autonomism influenced the German and Dutch ''Autonomen'', the worldwide [[social centre movement]], and today is influential in Italy, France, and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[anarchists]].

==Etymology==
The term ''autonomia''/''Autonome'' is composed out of two Greek words: αὐτο- ''auto-'' "self" and νόμος ''nomos'', "law", hence when combined understood to mean "one who gives oneself one's own [[law]]". [[Wiktionary:autonomy|Autonomy]], in this sense, is not [[independence]]. While independence refers to an [[autarky|autarchic]] kind of life, separated from the [[community]], autonomy refers to life in society but by one's own rule. Though the notion of ''autonomism'' was alien to the ancient Greeks, the concept is indirectly endorsed by [[Aristotle]], who stated that only beasts or gods could be independent and live apart from the ''[[polis]]'' ("community"), while [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] defined the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] by autonomy of thought and the famous ''"[[Sapere aude]]"'' ("dare to know").

==The Marxist Autonomist theory==
{{Left communism sidebar|Related}}
Unlike other forms of [[Marxism]], autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the [[working class]] to force changes to the organization of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system independent of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[trade unions]] or [[political parties]]. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than are other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a "bottom-up" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working-class resistance to capitalism, such as [[absenteeism]], slow working, socialization in the workplace, [[sabotage]], and other subversive activities.

Like other Marxists, autonomists see [[class struggle]] as being of central importance. However, autonomists have a broader definition of the working class than do other Marxists: as well as wage-earning workers (both [[White-collar worker|white collar]] and [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]]), autonomists also include in this category the unwaged (students, the unemployed, homemakers, etc.), who are traditionally deprived of any form of union representation.

Early theorists (such as [[Mario Tronti]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Sergio Bologna]], and [[Paolo Virno]]) developed notions of "immaterial" and "social labour" that extended the Marxist concept of labour to all society. They suggested that modern society's wealth was produced by unaccountable [[collective]] work, and that only a little of this was redistributed to the workers in the form of wages. Other Italian autonomists—particularly feminists, such as [[Mariarosa Dalla Costa]] and [[Silvia Federici]]—emphasised the importance of [[feminism]] and the value of unpaid female labour to capitalist society.

A scholar of the movement, Michael Ryan, writes that {{quote|Autonomy, as a movement and as a theory, opposes the notion that capitalism is an irrational system which can be made rational through planning. Instead, it assumes the workers' viewpoint, privileging their activity as the lever of revolutionary passage as that which alone can construct a communist society. Economics is seen as being entirely political; economic relations are direct political relations of force between class subjects. And it is in the economic category of the social worker, not in an alienated political form like the party, that the initiative for political change resides.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ryan, "Translators' Introductions Part II," Antonio Negri, Marx beyond Marx: Lessons on the Grundrisse, New York: Autonomedia, 1991, p. xxx.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Italian autonomism==
[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|left|[[Antonio Negri]], a leading theorist of Italian autonomism]]
Autonomist Marxism—referred to in Italy as ''[[operaismo]]'', which translates literally as "workerism"—first appeared in Italy in the early 1960s. Arguably, the emergence of early autonomism can be traced to the dissatisfaction of automotive workers in [[Turin]] with their union, which reached an agreement with [[FIAT]]. The disillusionment of these workers with their organised representation, along with the resultant riots (in particular the 1962 riots by FIAT workers in Turin, "fatti di Piazza Statuto"), were critical factors in the development of a theory of self-organised labour representation outside the scope of traditional representatives such as [[trade union]]s.

In 1969, the ''[[operaismo]]'' approach was active mainly in two different groups: ''[[Lotta Continua]]'', led by [[Adriano Sofri]] (which had a very significant [[Roman Catholic]] cultural matrix), and ''[[Potere Operaio]]'', led by [[Antonio Negri]], [[Franco Piperno]], [[Oreste Scalzone]], and [[Valerio Morucci]]. [[Mario Capanna]] was the charismatic leader of the Milan student movement, which had a more classical [[Marxist-Leninist]] approach.

===Influences===
Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson–Forest Tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]. The Johnson-Forest Tendency had studied working-class life and struggles within the US auto industry, publishing pamphlets such as "The American Worker" (1947), "Punching Out" (1952), and "Union Committeemen and Wildcat Strikes" (1955). That work was translated into French by Socialisme ou Barbarie and published, serially, in their journal. They too began investigating and writing about what was going on inside workplaces, in their case inside both auto factories and insurance offices.

The journal ''Quaderni Rossi'' ("Red Notebooks"), produced between 1961 and 1965, and its successor ''Classe Operaia'' ("Working Class"), produced between 1963 and 1966, were also influential in the development of early autonomism. [[Raniero Panzieri]], [[Mario Tronti]], and [[Toni Negri]] were some primary collaborators.

[[Pirate radio]] stations also were a factor in spreading autonomist ideas. [[Bologna]]'s [[Radio Alice]] was an example of such a station.

===Direct action===
{{further|Years of Lead (Italy)}}

[[File:Askatasuna torino.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Askatasuna'' "autonomist" social center in [[Turin]] (2016)]]

The Italian [[student movement]], including the [[Indiani Metropolitani]] (Metropolitan Indians), starting from 1966 with the murder of student Paolo Rossi by [[neo-fascists]] at [[Sapienza University of Rome|Rome University]], engaged in various [[direct action]] operations, including riots and occupations, along with more peaceful activities such as self-reduction, in which individuals refused to pay for such services and goods as public transport, electricity, gas, rent, and food. Several clashes occurred between students and the police during the occupations of universities in the winter of 1967–68, during the [[Fiat]] occupations, and in March 1968 in Rome during the [[Battle of Valle Giulia]].

Indiani Metropolitani were a small faction active in the Italian far-left protest movement during 1976 and 1977, in the so-called "[[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]]". The Indiani Metropolitani were the so-called 'creative' wing of the movement. Its adherents wore face-paint like the war-paint of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and dressed like [[hippies]]. The emphasis was on "stare insieme" (being together), spontaneity and the arts, especially music. The group was active in Rome, during the occupation of the university La Sapienza in 1977.

On 11 March 1977, riots took place in Bologna following the killing of student Francesco Lorusso by police.

Beginning in 1979, the state effectively prosecuted the autonomist movement, accusing it of protecting the [[Red Brigades]], which had kidnapped and assassinated [[Aldo Moro]]. 12,000 far-left activists were detained; 600 fled the country, including 300 to France and 200 to South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}[http://sebastien.schifres.free.fr/italie.htm On the Autonomist movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:tute bianche.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Members of the Italian militant social movement [[Tute Bianche]]]]

[[Tute Bianche]] was a militant Italian social movement, active from 1994 to 2001. Activists covered their bodies with padding so as to resist the blows of police, to push through police lines, and to march together in large blocks for mutual protection during [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]]. The tute bianche movement reached its apex during the [[27th G8 summit|anti-G8 protests in Genoa]], in July 2001, with a turn-out of an estimated 10,000 protesters in a single "padded block", ironically after a collective decision to go without the white overalls. Shortly after Genoa the Ya Basta Association disbanded, with certain segments reforming into the "Disobbedienti" which literally means "Disobedients". This philosophy includes the occupation and creation of [[Squatting|squat]]ted self-managed social centers, anti-sexist [[activism]], support for immigrant's rights and refugees seeking political asylum, as well as the process of walking together in large formations during demonstrations held in the streets, by force if necessary in case of clashes with police.

Central to the tute bianche movement was the Italian [[Ya Basta Association]], a network of groups throughout Italy that was inspired by the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] uprising in Chiapas in 1994. Ya Basta primarily originated in the "autonomist" [[social centers]] of Milan, particularly [[CS Leoncavallo|Centro Sociale Leoncavallo]]. These social centers grew out of the Italian Autonomia movement of the 1970 and 80s. The tute bianches have had international variations of one sort or another. For instance, in Britain a group calling itself [[WOMBLES]] adopted the tactics, even though the political orientation of WOMBLES differed from the Italian movement. In Spain, "Mono Blanco" was the preferred identifier. The first North American variant of the tute bianche, the [[NYC Ya Basta Collective]] (based in NYC) wore yellow overalls, rather than white.

==The French ''autonome'' movement&lt;!--linked from 'Cornelius Castoriadis'--&gt;==
{{Libertarian socialism|Philosophies}}

In France, the Marxist group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]], led by philosopher [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], could be said to be one of the first autonomist groups. Socialisme ou Barbarie drew upon the activist research of the American Johnson-Forest Tendency inside US auto plants and carried out their own investigations into rank-and-file workers struggles, struggles that were autonomous of union or party leadership.

Also parallel to the work of the Johnson-Forest Tendency, Socialisme ou Barbarie harshly criticised the [[Communist]] regime in the [[USSR]], which it considered a form of "[[bureaucratic collectivism|bureaucratic capitalism]]" and not at all the [[state socialism|socialism]] it claimed to be. Philosopher [[Jean-François Lyotard]] was also part of this movement.

However, the Italian influence of the ''operaismo'' movement was more directly felt in the creation of the review ''Matériaux pour l'intervention'' (1972–73) by Yann Moulier-Boutang, a French economist close to Toni Negri. This led in turn to the creation of the Camarades group (1974–78). Along with others, Moulier-Boutang joined the Centre International pour des Nouveaux Espaces de Liberté (CINEL), founded three years earlier by [[Félix Guattari]], and assisted Italian activists accused of terrorism, of whom at least 300 fled to France.

The French autonome mouvement organised itself in the AGPA (Assemblée Parisienne des Groupes Autonomes, "Parisian Assembly of Autonome Groups"; 1977–78). Many tendencies were present in it, including the Camarades group led by Moulier-Boutang, members of the Organisation communiste libertaire, some people referring themselves to the "Desiring Autonomy" of Bob Nadoulek, but also squatters and street-wise people (including the groupe Marge). French autonomes supported captured [[Red Army Faction]] former members. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] also intervened on the conditions for the detention of RAF detainees.

The militant group [[Action directe (armed group)|Action directe]] appeared in 1979 and carried out several violent direct actions. Action Directe claimed responsibility for the murders of [[Renault]]'s CEO [[Georges Besse]] and General Audran. George Besse had been CEO of nuclear company [[Eurodif]]. Action Directe was dissolved in 1987.

In the 1980s, the autonomist movement underwent a deep crisis in Italy because of effective prosecution by the State, and was stronger in Germany than in France. It remained present in Parisian squats and in some riots (for example in 1980 near the [[Jussieu Campus]] in Paris, or in 1982 in the [[Ardennes (département)|Ardennes department]] during [[anti-nuclear]] demonstrations). From 1986 to 1994 the French group [[:fr:Comité des mal logés|"Comité des mal logés"]] occupied several buildings of the French national social housing authority to denounce the cruel lack of lodging for workers, they were several hundred and took their decisions in democratic assembly, with support from all autonomous groups of Paris, many of them were worked on the anti prison . In the 1980s, the French autonomists published the periodicals ''CAT Pages'' (1981–82), ''Rebelles'' (1981–93), ''Tout !'' (1982–85), ''Molotov et Confetti'' (1984), ''Les Fossoyeurs du Vieux Monde'', ''La Chôme'' (1984–85), and ''Contre'' (1987–89).

In the 1990s, the French autonomist movement was present in struggles led by unemployed people, with Travailleurs, Chômeurs, et Précaires en colère (TCP, "Angry Workers, Unemployed, and Marginalised people") and l'Assemblée générale des chômeurs de Jussieu ("General Assembly of Jussieu's unemployed people"). It was also involved in the [[alter-globalisation]] movement and above all in the solidarity with illegal foreigners (Collective Des Papiers pour tous ("Permits for all", 1996) and Collectif Anti-Expulsion (1998–2005)). Several autonomist journals date from this time: ''[[Quilombo]]'' (1988–93), ''Apache'' (1990–98), ''Tic-Tac'' (1995–97), ''Karoshi'' (1998–99), and ''Tiqqun'' (1999–2001).

From 19 to 28 July 2002, a [[No borders]] camp was made in [[Strasbourg]] to protest against anti-immigration policies, in particular inside the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen European space]].

In 2003, autonomists came into conflict with the [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialist Party]] (PS) during a demonstration that took place in the frame of the [[European Social Forum]] in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]] (Paris). At the end of December, hundreds of unemployed people helped themselves in the ''[[Bon Marché]]'' supermarket to be able to celebrate Christmas (an action called "''[[autoréduction]]''" (of prices) in French). [[Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité|French riot police]] (CRS) physically opposed the unemployed people inside the shop. Autonomes rioted during the [[2006 labour protests in France|spring 2006 protests]] against the [[First Employment Contract|CPE]], and again after the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential election]] when [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] was elected.

On 11 November 2008, the French police arrested ten people, including five living in a farmhouse on a hill overlooking Tarnac, and accused them of associating with a "terrorist enterprise" by sabotaging TGV's overhead lines. Nine out of ten were let go and only [[Julien Coupat]], the alleged leader, remained in custody for about a year, charged with "directing a terrorist group" by the Paris Prosecutor's office.

==The German ''Autonome'' movement in the 1970s and 1980s==
In Germany, ''Autonome'' was used during the late 1970s to depict the most radical part of the political left.&lt;ref&gt;''FIRE AND FLAMES: A History of the German Autonomist Movement'' by Geronimo. AK Press. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals participated in practically all actions of the social movements at the time, especially in demonstrations against [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] plants (Brokdorf 1981, Wackersdorf 1986) and in actions against the construction of airport runways (Frankfurt 1976–86). The defense of [[Squatting|squats]] against the police such as in [[Hamburg]]'s ''Hafenstraße'' was also a major "task" for the "autonome" movement. The Dutch anarchist ''Autonomen'' movement from the 1960s also concentrated on squatting.

Tactics of the "Autonome" were usually militant, including the construction of barricades or throwing stones or [[molotov cocktail]]s at the police. During their most powerful times in the early 1980s, on at least one occasion the police had to take flight.

Because of their outfit (heavy black clothing, ski masks, helmets), the "Autonome" were dubbed ''der schwarze Block'' by the German media, and in these tactics were similar to modern [[black bloc]]s. In 1989, laws regarding demonstrations in Germany were changed, prohibiting the use of so-called "passive weaponry" such as helmets or padding and covering your face.

Today, the "autonome" scene in Germany is greatly reduced and concentrates mainly on [[anti-fascist]] actions, ecology, solidarity with [[refugee]]s, and [[feminism]]. There are larger and more militant groups still in operation, such as in Switzerland or Italy.

==The Greek ''anarcho-autonomoi''&lt;!--Linked from [[Anarchism in Greece]] and [[Squatting]]; redirects here--&gt;==

{{Anarcho-communism sidebar|Related}}
{{main|Anarchism in Greece}}
In Greece, the ''anarcho-autonomoi'' (Greek αναρχο-αυτόνομοι "anarchist-autonomists") emerged as an important{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} trend in the youth and student movement, first during the 1973 [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] against the military dictatorship that ruled the country at the time. After the collapse of the dictatorship in 1974, the "anarcho-autonomoi" became considerably influential{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, firstly as a social trend within the youth and then as a (very loose and diverse) political trend. The definition "anarcho-autonomoi", itself, is much debated. One reason for this is that it was originally coined by opponents. However, it was also quite quickly adopted by many adherents, used as a generic term.

Before 1973, in Greece, there was very little tradition in anarchism or libertarian socialism in general. Thus, the radical Greek youth in the 1970s, having very little relative background to refer to, resided to an extensive "syncretism" of multiple trends originating in the respective movements in other European countries. Anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist trends converged with situationist, workerist, or other autonomist trends and even with radical (non-autonomist) Marxist trends. The "anarcho-autonomoi" made a very strong stand{{citation needed} during the 1978–80 student movement, coming into violent confrontation with the police and the (also, of considerable influence) Stalinist communist youth (K.N.E). Such stands were repeated whenever the student, worker, and youth movements were rising (in 1987, 1990–91, 1998–99, and 2006–7). However, their intensity has been falling since 1990–91.

Parallel to such participation in social movements, a large number of social centres (many of them squatted) exist to this day around Greece, and many of them participate in social struggles on a local level. These social centres, whether they now identify as "Autonomist" or not (most use terms such as "anti-authority" (αντιεξουσιαστής), while some identify as "anarchist" ), function in the ways that historically emerged through "Autonomia". There is also a multitude of small political groups which identify as "Autonomist", ranging from workerist to post-modernist. Most of them are still connected to the respective groups that identify as "Anarchist".

==Influence==
The Autonomist Marxist and ''Autonomen'' movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English-speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists{{who|date=January 2013}} even describe themselves as ''Autonomists''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The Italian ''operaismo'' movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright, and Nick Dyer-Witheford.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In Denmark and Sweden, the word is used as a catch-all phrase for anarchists and the extra-parliamentary left in general, as was seen in the media coverage of the eviction of the [[Ungdomshuset]] [[squatting|squat]] in [[Copenhagen]] in March 2007.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[File:Begriffsschrift Titel.png|thumb|200px|The title page of the original 1879 edition]]
'''''Begriffsschrift''''' (German for, roughly, "concept-script") is a book on [[logic]] by [[Gottlob Frege]], published in 1879, and the [[formal system]] set out in that book.

''Begriffsschrift'' is usually translated as ''concept writing'' or ''concept notation''; the full title of the book identifies it as "a [[formula]] [[language]], modeled on that of [[arithmetic]], of pure [[thought]]." Frege's motivation for developing his formal approach to logic resembled [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s motivation for his [[calculus ratiocinator]] (despite that, in the foreword Frege clearly denies that he achieved this aim, and also that his main aim would be constructing an ideal language like Leibniz's, which Frege declares to be a quite hard and idealistic, however not impossible, task). Frege went on to employ his logical calculus in his research on the [[foundations of mathematics]], carried out over the next quarter century.

== Notation and the system ==
The calculus contains the first appearance of quantified variables, and is essentially classical bivalent [[second-order logic]] with identity.  It is bivalent in that sentences or formulas denote either True or False; second order because it includes relation variables in addition to object variables and allows quantification over both.  The modifier "with identity" specifies that the language includes the identity relation, =.

Frege presents his calculus using idiosyncratic two-dimensional [[mathematical notation|notation]]: connectives and quantifiers are written using lines connecting formulas, rather than the symbols ¬, ∧, and ∀ in use today. For example, that judgement ''B'' materially implies judgement ''A'', i.e. &lt;math&gt; B \rightarrow A &lt;/math&gt; is written as [[File:BS-05-Kondicionaliskis-svg.svg|60px]].

In the first chapter, Frege defines basic ideas and notation, like proposition ("judgement"), the [[universal quantifier]] ("the generality"), the [[material conditional|conditional]], [[negation]] and the "sign for identity of content" &lt;math&gt; \equiv &lt;/math&gt; (which he used to indicate both [[material equivalence]] and identity proper); in the second chapter he declares nine formalized propositions as axioms.

||Content identity (equivalence/identity)
|style="text-align:center;"|&lt;math&gt;A\equiv B&lt;/math&gt;
|style="text-align:center;"|&lt;math&gt;A \leftrightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;A \equiv B&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt;
|}

In chapter 1, §5, Frege defines the conditional as follows:

:"Let A and B refer to judgeable contents, then the four possibilities are:
# A is asserted, B is asserted;
# A is asserted, B is negated;
# A is negated, B is asserted;
#A is negated, B is negated.

Let

:[[File:Kondicionaliskis wb.png]]
signify that the third of those possibilities does not obtain, but one of the three others does. So if we negate [[File:Begriffsschrift connective2.svg|69x55px]],                              
that means the third possibility is valid, i.e. we negate A and assert B."

== The calculus in Frege's work  ==
Frege declared nine of his propositions to be [[axiom]]s, and justified them by arguing informally that, given their intended meanings, they express self-evident truths. Re-expressed in contemporary notation, these axioms are:

# &lt;math&gt; \vdash \ \ A \rightarrow \left( B \rightarrow A \right) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \vdash \ \ \left[ \ A \rightarrow \left( B \rightarrow C \right) \ \right] \ \rightarrow \ \left[ \ \left( A \rightarrow B \right) \rightarrow \left( A \rightarrow C \right) \ \right] &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \vdash \ \ \left[ \ D \rightarrow \left( B \rightarrow A \right) \ \right] \ \rightarrow \ \left[ \ B \rightarrow \left( D \rightarrow A \right) \ \right] &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \vdash \ \ \left( B \rightarrow A \right) \ \rightarrow \ \left( \lnot A \rightarrow \lnot B \right) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \vdash \ \ \lnot \lnot A \rightarrow A &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \vdash \ \ A \rightarrow  \lnot\lnot A &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \vdash \ \ \left( c=d \right) \rightarrow \left( f(c) = f(d) \right) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \vdash \ \ c = c &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \vdash \ \  \forall a \ f(a)  \rightarrow \ f(c) &lt;/math&gt;

These are propositions 1, 2, 8, 28, 31, 41, 52, 54, and 58 in the ''Begriffschrifft''. (1)–(3) govern [[material conditional|material implication]], (4)–(6) [[negation]], (7) and (8) identity, and (9) the [[universal quantifier]]. (7) expresses [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s [[identity of indiscernibles|indiscernibility of identicals]], and (8) asserts that identity is a [[reflexive relation]].

All other propositions are deduced from (1)–(9) by invoking any of the following [[inference rule]]s:
*[[Modus ponens]] allows us to infer &lt;math&gt;\vdash B&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\vdash A \to B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vdash A&lt;/math&gt;;
*The [[generalization (logic)|rule of generalization]] allows us to infer &lt;math&gt;\vdash P \to \forall x A(x)&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\vdash P \to A(x)&lt;/math&gt; if ''x'' does not occur in ''P'';
*The [[first-order logic#Rules of inference|rule of substitution]], which Frege does not state explicitly. This rule is much harder to articulate precisely than the two preceding rules, and Frege invokes it in ways that are not obviously legitimate.

The main results of the third chapter, titled "Parts from a general series theory," concern what is now called the [[ancestral relation|ancestral]] of a relation ''R''. "''a'' is an ''R''-ancestor of ''b''" is written "''aR''*''b''".

Frege applied the results from the ''Begriffsschrifft'', including those on the ancestral of a relation, in his later work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]''. Thus, if we take ''xRy'' to be the relation ''y'' = ''x'' + 1, then 0''R''*''y'' is the predicate "''y'' is a natural number." (133) says that if ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are [[natural number]]s, then one of the following must hold: ''x'' &lt; ''y'', ''x'' = ''y'', or ''y'' &lt; ''x''. This is the so-called "law of [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy]]".

== Influence on other works ==
For a careful recent study of how the ''Begriffsschrift'' was reviewed in the German mathematical literature, see Vilko (1998). Some reviewers, especially [[Ernst Schröder]], were on the whole favorable. All work in formal logic subsequent to the ''Begriffsschrift'' is indebted to it, because its second-order logic was the first formal logic capable of representing a fair bit of mathematics and natural language.

Some vestige of Frege's notation survives in the "[[Turnstile (symbol)|turnstile]]" symbol &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; derived from his   "Urteilsstrich" (''judging/inferring stroke'') │ and "Inhaltsstrich" (i.e. ''content stroke'') ──. Frege used these symbols in the ''Begriffsschrift'' in the unified form ├─ for declaring that a proposition is true.  In his later "Grundgesetze" he revises slightly his interpretation of the ├─ symbol.

In "Begriffsschrift" the "Definitionsdoppelstrich" (i.e. ''definition double stroke'') │├─ indicates that a proposition is a definition. Furthermore, the negation sign  &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt; can be read as a combination of the horizontal ''Inhaltsstrich'' with a vertical negation stroke. This negation symbol was reintroduced by  [[Arend Heyting]]&lt;ref&gt;Arend Heyting: "Die formalen Regeln der intuitionistischen Logik," in: ''Sitzungsberichte der preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, phys.-math. Klasse'', 1930, pp. 42–65.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1930 to distinguish [[intuitionistic]] from classical negation. It also appears in [[Gerhard Gentzen|Gerhard Gentzen's]] doctoral dissertation.

In the ''[[Tractatus Logico Philosophicus]]'', [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] pays homage to Frege by employing the term ''Begriffsschrift'' as a synonym for logical formalism.

Frege's 1892 essay, "[[On Sense and Reference]]," recants some of the conclusions of the ''Begriffsschrifft'' about identity (denoted in mathematics by the "=" sign).  In particular, he rejects the "Begriffsschrift" view that the identity predicate expresses a relationship between names, in favor of the conclusion that it expresses [[equality (mathematics)|a relationship between the objects]] that are [[denotation (semiotics)|denoted]] by those names.

== Quotations ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If the task of philosophy is to break the domination of words over the human mind [...], then my concept notation, being developed for these purposes, can be a useful instrument for philosophers [...] I believe the cause of logic has been advanced  already by the invention of this concept notation." (Preface to the ''Begriffsschrift'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1973">[[File:Framing hammer.jpg|thumbnail|200px|A hammer could be used as a blunt instrument]]
A '''blunt instrument''' is any solid [[Physical body|object]] used as a [[weapon]], which damages its target by applying direct mechanical force, and has no penetrating point or edge, or is wielded so that the point or edge is not the part of the weapon that inflicts the injury. Blunt instruments may be contrasted with [[edged weapon]]s, which inflict injury by cutting or stabbing, or [[projectile weapons]], where the projectiles, such as [[bullet]]s or [[arrow]]s, are accelerated to a damaging speed.

Blunt instruments typically inflict [[blunt force trauma]], causing bruising, fractures and other internal bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|1680107|Forensic Autopsy of Blunt Force Trauma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the parts of the body attacked, [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s may be ruptured or otherwise damaged. Attacks with a blunt instrument may be fatal.

Some sorts of blunt instruments are very readily available, and often figure in [[crime]] cases.  Examples of blunt instruments include:

* Personal implements such as [[walking stick]]s
* Tools such as [[hammer]]s, [[Crowbar (tool)|wrecking bar]]s, [[pipe wrench]]es, or heftier [[flashlight]]s such as the [[Maglite]] or [[Kel-Lite]].
* Parts of tools, such as [[pickaxe handle]]s
* Sports equipment such as [[cricket bat|cricket]] or [[baseball bat]]s, [[hockey stick]]s, [[pool cue]]s, [[golf club]]s, etc.
* Weapons such as [[Baton (law enforcement)|nightstick]]s, [[bâton français|bâtons français]], [[axe]]s, [[spear]]s (using the haft), or [[gun]]s (see [[firearm as a blunt weapon]])
* Other items, such as [[millwall brick]]s or [[tree]] [[branch]]es

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3689">'''Cognitive emotional behavioral therapy''' ('''CEBT''') is an extended version of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) aimed at helping individuals to evaluate the basis of their emotional distress and thus reduce the need for associated dysfunctional [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] behaviors (e.g., eating behaviors including binging, purging, restriction of food intake, and substance misuse). This psychotherapeutic intervention draws on a range of models and techniques including [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), [[mindfulness meditation]], [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT), and experiential exercises.

In [[physics]], a '''conservation law''' states that a particular measurable property of an isolated [[physical system]] does not change as the system evolves over time. Exact conservation laws include [[conservation of energy]], [[conservation of linear momentum]], [[conservation of angular momentum]], and [[conservation of electric charge]]. There are also many approximate conservation laws, which apply to such quantities as [[conservation of mass|mass]], [[Parity (physics)|parity]], [[lepton number]], [[baryon number]], [[strangeness]], [[hypercharge]], etc.  These quantities are conserved in certain classes of physics processes, but not in all.

A local conservation law is usually expressed mathematically as a [[continuity equation]], a [[partial differential equation]] which gives a relation between the amount of the quantity and the "transport" of that quantity.    It states that the amount of the conserved quantity at a point or within a volume can only change by the amount of the quantity which flows in or out of the volume.

From [[Noether's theorem]], each conservation law is associated with a [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] in the underlying physics.

==Conservation laws as fundamental laws of nature==

Conservation laws are fundamental to our understanding of the physical world, in that they describe which processes can or cannot occur in nature.  For example, the conservation law of energy states that the total quantity of energy in an isolated system does not change, though it may change form.  In general, the total quantity of the property governed by that law remains unchanged during physical processes.  With respect to classical physics, conservation laws include conservation of energy, mass (or matter), linear momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge.  With respect to particle physics, particles cannot be created or destroyed except in pairs, where one is ordinary and the other is an antiparticle.  With respect to symmetries and invariance principles, three special conservation laws have been described, associated with inversion or reversal of space, time, and charge.

Conservation laws are considered to be fundamental laws of nature, with broad application in physics, as well as in other fields such as chemistry, biology, geology, and engineering.

Most conservation laws are exact, or absolute, in the sense that they apply to all possible processes.  Some conservation laws are partial, in that they hold for some processes but not for others.

One particularly important result concerning conservation laws is [[Noether's theorem]], which states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between each one of them and a differentiable [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] of nature.  For example, the conservation of energy follows from the time-invariance of physical systems, and the conservation of angular momentum arises from the fact that physical systems behave the same regardless of how they are oriented in space.

==Approximate laws==

There are also '''approximate''' conservation laws.  These are approximately true in particular situations, such as low speeds, short time scales, or certain interactions.

* [[Conservation of mass|Conservation of rest mass]]
* Conservation of [[baryon number]] (See [[chiral anomaly]] and [[sphaleron]])
* Conservation of [[lepton number]] (In the [[Standard Model]])
* Conservation of [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]] (violated by the [[weak interaction]])
* Conservation of [[parity (physics)|parity]]
* Invariance under [[charge conjugation]]
* Invariance under [[T-symmetry|time reversal]]
* [[CP symmetry]], the combination of charge and parity conjugation (equivalent to time reversal if CPT holds)

==Global and local conservation laws==
The total amount of some conserved quantity in the universe could remain unchanged if an equal amount were to appear at one point ''A'' and simultaneously disappear from another separate point ''B''.  For example, an amount of energy could appear on Earth without changing the total amount in the Universe if the same amount of energy were to disappear from a remote region of the Universe.  This weak form of "global" conservation is really not a conservation law because it is not [[Lorentz invariant]], so phenomena like the above do not occur in nature.&lt;ref name="Aitchison"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to [[Special Relativity]], if the appearance of the energy at ''A'' and disappearance of the energy at ''B'' are simultaneous in one [[inertial reference frame]], they will not be simultaneous in other inertial reference frames moving with respect to the first.  In a moving frame one will occur before the other; either the energy at ''A'' will appear ''before'' or ''after'' the energy at ''B'' disappears.  In both cases, during the interval energy will not be conserved.  

A stronger form of conservation law requires that, for the amount of a conserved quantity at a point to change, there must be a flow, or ''flux'' of the quantity into or out of the point.  For example, the amount of [[electric charge]] in a volume is never found to change without an [[electric current]] into or out of the volume that carries the difference in charge.  Since it only involves continuous ''[[principle of locality|local]]'' changes, this stronger type of conservation law is [[Lorentz invariant]]; a quantity conserved in one reference frame is conserved in all moving reference frames.&lt;ref name="Aitchison" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt;  This is called a ''local conservation'' law.&lt;ref name="Aitchison" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt;  Local conservation also implies global conservation; that the total amount of the conserved quantity in the Universe remains constant.  All of the conservation laws listed above are local conservation laws. A local conservation law is expressed mathematically by a ''[[continuity equation]]'', which states that the change in the quantity in a volume is equal to the total net  "flux" of the quantity through the surface of the volume.  The following sections discuss continuity equations in general.

==Differential forms==
{{see also|conservation form|continuity equation}}
In continuum mechanics, the most general form of an exact conservation law is given by a [[continuity equation]]. For example, conservation of electric charge ''q'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{j} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ∇⋅ is the [[divergence]] operator, ''ρ'' is the density of ''q'' (amount per unit volume), '''j''' is the flux of ''q'' (amount crossing a unit area in unit time), and ''t'' is time.

If we assume that the motion '''u''' of the charge is a continuous function of position and time, then
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{j} = \rho \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In one space dimension this can be put into the form of a homogeneous first-order [[nonlinear partial differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic equation]]:&lt;ref name="To24"&gt;see Toro, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + A(y) y_x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the dependent variable ''y'' is called the ''density'' of a ''conserved quantity'', and ''A(y)'' is called the ''[[current jacobian]]'', and the [[Notation for differentiation#Partial derivatives|subscript notation for partial derivatives]] has been employed. The more general inhomogeneous case:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + A(y) y_x = s &lt;/math&gt;

is not a conservation equation but the general kind of [[balance equation]] describing a [[dissipative system]]. The dependent variable ''y'' is called a ''nonconserved quantity'', and the inhomogeneous term ''s(y,x,t)'' is the-''[[Divergence|source]]'', or [[dissipation]]. For example, balance equations of this kind are the momentum and energy [[Navier-Stokes equations]], or the [[entropy#Entropy balance equation for open systems|entropy balance]] for a general [[isolated system]].

In the '''one-dimensional space''' a conservation equation is a first-order [[nonlinear partial differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic equation]] that can be put into the ''advection'' form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + a(y) y_x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the dependent variable ''y(x,t)'' is called the density of the ''conserved'' (scalar) quantity (c.q.(d.) = conserved quantity (density)), and ''a(y)'' is called the '''current coefficient''', usually corresponding to the [[partial derivative]] in the conserved quantity of a [[current density]] (c.d.) of the conserved quantity ''j(y)'':&lt;ref name="To24" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; a(y) = j_y (y)&lt;/math&gt;

In this case since the [[chain rule]] applies:

:&lt;math&gt; j_x= j_y (y) y_x = a(y) y_x &lt;/math&gt;

the conservation equation can be put into the current density form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + j_x (y)= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In a '''space with more than one dimension''' the former definition can be extended to an equation that can be put into the form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + \mathbf a(y) \cdot \nabla y = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''conserved quantity'' is ''y('''r''',t)'', ''&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;'' denotes the [[scalar product]], ''&amp;nabla;'' is the [[nabla symbol|nabla]] operator, here indicating a [[gradient]], and ''a(y)'' is a vector of current coefficients, analogously corresponding to the [[divergence]] of a vector c.d. associated to the c.q. '''j'''(y):

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + \nabla \cdot \mathbf  j(y) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

This is the case for the [[continuity equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_t + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf u) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Here the conserved quantity is the [[mass]], with [[density]] ''&amp;rho;''('''r''',t) and current density  ''&amp;rho;'''''u''', identical to the [[momentum conservation|momentum density]], while '''u'''('''r''',t) is the [[flow velocity]].

In the '''general case''' a conservation equation can be also a system of this kind of equations (a [[vector equation]]) in the form:&lt;ref name="To24" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_t + \mathbf A(\mathbf y) \cdot \nabla \mathbf y = \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where '''y''' is called the ''conserved'' ('''vector''') quantity, &amp;nabla; y is its [[gradient]], '''0''' is the [[zero vector]], and '''A(y)''' is called the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of the current density. In fact as in the former scalar case, also in the vector case '''A(y)''' usually corresponding to the Jacobian of a [[current density matrix]] '''J(y)''':

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf A( \mathbf y) = \mathbf J_{\mathbf y} (\mathbf y)&lt;/math&gt;

and the conservation equation can be put into the form:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_t + \nabla \cdot \mathbf J (\mathbf y)= \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;

For example, this the case for Euler equations (fluid dynamics). In the simple incompressible case they are:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla\cdot \mathbf u=0\\[1.2ex]
{\partial \mathbf u \over\partial t}+ \mathbf u \cdot
\nabla \mathbf u + \nabla s =\mathbf{0},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*'''''u''''' is the [[flow velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], with components in a N-dimensional space ''u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''u&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' ... ''u&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'',
*''s'' is the specific [[pressure]] (pressure per unit [[density]]) giving the [[Linear differential equation|source term]],

{{see also|Euler equations (fluid dynamics)}}

It can be shown that the conserved (vector) quantity and the c.d. matrix for these equations are respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}1 \\  \mathbf u \end{pmatrix}; \qquad
{\mathbf J}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf u\\ \mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u + s \mathbf I\end{pmatrix};\qquad
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'' denotes the [[outer product]].

==Integral and weak forms==
Conservation equations can be also expressed in integral form: the advantage of the latter is substantially that it requires less smoothness of the solution, which paves the way to [[weak formulation|weak form]], extending the class of admissible solutions to include discontinuous solutions.&lt;ref name="ToroInt"&gt;see Toro, p.62-63&lt;/ref&gt; By integrating in any space-time domain the current density form in 1-D space:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + j_x (y)= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and by using [[Green's theorem]], the integral form is:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{- \infty}^\infty y \, dx + \int_0^\infty j (y) \, dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In a similar fashion, for the scalar multidimensional space, the integral form is:

:&lt;math&gt; \oint [y \, d^N r + j (y) \, dt] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the line integration is performed along the boundary of the domain, in an anticlock-wise manner.&lt;ref name="ToroInt" /&gt;

Moreover, by defining a [[test function]] ''&amp;phi;''('''r''',''t'') continuously differentiable both in time and space with compact support, the [[weak formulation|weak form]] can be obtained pivoting on the [[initial condition]]. In 1-D space it is:

: &lt;math&gt; \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi_t y + \phi_x j(y) \,dx \,dt = - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi(x,0) y(x,0) \, dx &lt;/math&gt;

Note that in the weak form all the partial derivatives of the density and current density have been passed on to the test function, which with the former hypothesis is sufficiently smooth to admit these derivatives.&lt;ref name="ToroInt" /&gt;

A '''conventional electrical unit''' (or '''conventional unit''' where there is no risk of ambiguity) is a [[unit of measurement]] in the field of [[electricity]] which is based on the so-called "conventional values" of the [[Josephson constant]] and the [[von Klitzing constant]] agreed by the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) in 1988. These units are very similar in scale to their corresponding [[SI unit]]s, but are not identical because of their different definition. They are distinguished from the corresponding SI units by setting the symbol in italic typeface and adding a subscript "90" – e.g., the conventional volt has the symbol ''V''{{sub|90}} – as they came into international use on 1 January 1990.

This system was developed to increase the precision of measurements: The Josephson and von Klitzing constants can be realized with great precision, repeatability and ease.  The conventional electrical units have achieved acceptance as an international standard and are commonly used outside of the physics community in both engineering and industry.

The conventional electrical units are "quasi-[[natural units|natural]]" in the sense that they are completely and exactly defined in terms of [[dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constant]]s.  They are the first set of measurement units to be defined in this way, and as such, represent a significant step towards using "natural" fundamental physics for practical measurement purposes.  However, the conventional electrical units are unlike other systems of natural units in that some physical constants are not set to unity but rather set to fixed numerical values that are very close (but not precisely the same) to those in the common [[SI]] system of units.

Four significant steps were taken in the last half century to increase the precision and utility of measurement units.  In 1967 the Thirteenth [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) defined the [[second]] of atomic time in the International System of Units as the duration of {{val|9192631770}} periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom.  In 1983, the seventeenth CGPM redefined the [[metre]] in terms of the second and the speed of light, thus fixing the speed of light at exactly {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}.  And in 1990, the eighteenth CGPM adopted conventional values for the Josephson constant and the von Klitzing constant, fixing the conventional Josephson constant at exactly {{val|483597.9|e=9|u=Hz/''"V"''}}, and the conventional von Klitzing constant at exactly {{val|25812.807|u=''"Ω"''}} (again, these volts and ohms are not precisely the same as the SI definitions but very nearly equivalent).

==Definition==
Conventional electrical units are based on defined values of the [[Josephson constant]] and the [[von Klitzing constant]], which allow practical measurements of [[electromotive force]] and [[electrical resistance]] respectively. &lt;ref name=CODATA2014&gt;{{cite journal

*The conventional [[volt]], ''V''{{sub|90}}, is the electromotive force (or electric potential difference) measured against a [[Josephson effect]] standard using the defined value of the Josephson constant, ''K''{{sub|J–90}}. ''See [[Josephson voltage standard]].''
*The conventional [[ohm]], ''Ω''{{sub|90}}, is the electrical resistance measured against a [[quantum Hall effect]] standard using the defined value of the von Klitzing constant, ''R''{{sub|K–90}}.
*Other conventional electrical units are defined by the normal physical relationships, as in the conversion table below.

==Comparison with natural units==
{{See also|Natural units}}

Conventional electrical units can be thought of as a scaled version of a system of [[natural units]] defined as

:&lt;math&gt; c = e = \hbar = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;

having consequence:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} = \alpha \ &lt;/math&gt; .

This is a more general (or less specific) version of either the particle physics "[[natural units]]" or the [[Natural units|quantum chromodynamical system of units]] but that no unit mass is fixed.  Like n.u. or QCD units, with conventional electrical units any observed variation over space or time in the value of the fine-structure constant, α, is attributed to variation in the Coulomb constant or [[vacuum permittivity]] or, since the speed of light, ''c'', is fixed, as a variation in the [[vacuum permeability]].

The following table provides a comparison of conventional electrical units with other natural unit systems:

'''''Desert Island Discs''''' is a radio programme broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]]. It was first broadcast on the [[BBC Forces Programme]] on 29 January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9045319/Desert-Island-Discs-Britains-longest-running-radio-show.html|title=Desert Island Discs: Britain's longest-running radio show |work=The Telegraph |date=29 January 2012 |location=London |first=Neil |last=Midgley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each week a guest, called a '[[castaway]]' during the programme, is asked to choose eight recordings (usually, but not always, music), a book and a luxury item that they would take if they were to be cast away on a [[desert island]], whilst discussing their lives and the reasons for their choices. It was devised and originally presented by [[Roy Plomley]]. Since 2006, the programme has been presented by [[Kirsty Young]].

More than 3,000 episodes have been recorded, with some guests having appeared more than once and some episodes featuring more than one guest.&lt;ref name="FaC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/find-a-castaway|title=Desert Island Discs – Find a castaway|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a guest who falls into both categories is [[Bob Monkhouse]], who appeared with his co-writer [[Denis Goodwin]] on 12 December 1955 and in his own right on 20 December 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/find-a-castaway?q=bob+monkhouse&amp;type=all|title=Desert Island Discs – Find a castaway|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Guests are invited to imagine themselves [[castaway|cast away]] on a [[desert island]], and choose eight recordings, originally gramophone records, to take with them; discussion of their choices permits a review of their life. Excerpts from their choices are played or, in the case of short pieces, the whole work. At the end of the programme they choose the one piece they regard most highly. Guests are also automatically given the ''[[Complete Works of Shakespeare]]'' and either the [[Bible]] or another appropriate religious or philosophical work.

Actress [[Judi Dench]], who suffers from [[macular degeneration]], was permitted to take an [[audiobook]] in place of a printed manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/11218144/Desert-Island-Discs-racks-up-a-milestone-of-delights.html |title=Desert Island Discs racks up a milestone of delights |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06bd681 |title=BBC Radio 4 – Desert Island Discs, Dame Judi Dench |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=2015-09-25 |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first castaway was [[Vic Oliver]], and several castaways, including [[Celia Johnson]], [[Arthur Askey]], [[Trevor Nunn]], [[John Schlesinger]], [[Kenneth Williams]], [[Terry Wogan]], [[Brian Rix]], [[David Attenborough]] and [[Adele Leigh]] have been cast away more than once. The most requested piece of music over the first 60 years was "Ode to Joy", the last movement of [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1879322.stm "Beethoven tops island hit list"], BBC News, 18 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most remarked broadcasts was [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]]'s 1958 selection of seven of her own recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8355952/Desert-Island-Discs-most-popular-requests.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Laura | last=Roberts | title=Desert Island Discs' most popular requests | date=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title = Elisabeth Schwarzkopf |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/51ed3e16#p009y865 |series = Desert Island Discs |network = BBC Radio 4 |airdate = 28 July 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; This record was subsequently beaten by British pianist Dame [[Moura Lympany]] on her second appearance on the programme on 28 July 1979 when all eight of her selections were of her own recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title = Dame Moura Lympany |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/35a36972#p009mx7g |series = Desert Island Discs |network = BBC Radio 4 |airdate = 28 July 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, Roy Plomley attempted to interview [[Alistair MacLean]], but ended up speaking to somebody else with the same name – and the programme was never broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pile|first=Stephen|title=The Book of Heroic Failures|edition=1980|pages=29–30|publisher=Futura|ISBN=0-7088-1908-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1981, [[Princess Margaret|HRH Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]], appeared as a castaway on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009mvhf|title=HRH Princess Margaret, Desert Island Discs - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening theme==
Plomley originally wanted the sounds of "surf breaking on a shore and the cries of sea birds" to open and close each programme. But Leslie Prowne, the head of popular record programmes at the [[BBC]], was concerned that it lacked definition and insisted that music should also be used. Plomley and the series' producer Frederic Piffard selected "[[By the Sleepy Lagoon]]", composed by [[Eric Coates]] (who appeared on the show in 1951). The tune has been used since the first transmission in 1942. The sound of [[herring gulls]] has accompanied the music except for a period of time in 1964 when tropical bird sounds were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Magee |first=Sean |title= Desert Island Discs: 70 Years Of Castaways |publisher=Bantam Press |date=13 September 2012 |page=8 |chapter=Chapter 2:1940s |isbn=978-0-593-07006-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright status==
Until late September 2009, ''Desert Island Discs'' could not be heard on the BBC's [[iPlayer]] service, which allows most programmes to be heard up to a week after transmission. The programme's website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs.shtml |title=Desert Island Discs – Home |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that this was due to rights issues, as explained in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article681767.ece|title=How a man in his pyjamas invented a radio classic|work=The Sunday Times |date=2 July 2006 | accessdate=25 February 2011|location=London|first=Charles|last=Bremner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on 27 September 2009 that an agreement had been reached as a result of which the programme would be available to stream via the iPlayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/2009/09/desert_island_discs_iplayer.html |author=Mark Damazer|title=BBC – Radio 4 Blog: Desert Island Discs comes to iPlayer |publisher=BBC |date=27 September 2009|accessdate=27 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode available through the iPlayer was with [[Barry Manilow]]. Subsequently, the programme was also made available as a podcast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/28/desert-island-discs-bbc-iplayer |title=BBC launches Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on iPlayer |work=The Guardian  |accessdate=28 September 2009 | location=London | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with the edition broadcast on 29 November 2009, which featured [[Morrissey]]. However, due to music clearance issues, the music selections on the podcast versions are reduced to only playing for around 30 seconds or so (and in rare instances are unavailable, as mentioned in an announcement made by Kirsty Young at the appropriate point of the programme).

On 30 March 2011, the BBC placed more than 500 episodes from the show's archive online to listen to via iPlayer. Other episodes have since been added, both new and old.

In the early years of the BBC, programmes were broadcast live and were generally not recorded. This, in addition to the BBC's policy of [[wiping]] that was applied during the 1950s and 1960s, means very few episodes from the first 20 years of the show are known to exist; the earliest episode still in existence is from 1951 and features actress [[Margaret Lockwood]]. Several extracts were preserved for posterity at the request of the guests, such as an extract featuring [[Alfred Hitchcock]] where he speaks about his films ''[[The Pleasure Garden (film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925) and ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), gives his view on the changing landscape of the film industry and briefly discusses his then upcoming film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960).

[[File:Dialectical Behavior Therapy Cycle EN.jpg|thumb|The stages used in dialectical behavior therapy]]

'''Dialectical behavior therapy''' ('''DBT''') is an evidence-based&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2963469 | pmid=20975829 | volume=3 | issue=9 | title=Dialectical behavior therapy: current indications and unique elements | year=2006 | journal=Psychiatry (Edgmont) | pages=62–8 | last1 = Chapman | first1 = AL}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[psychotherapy]] designed to help people suffering from [[borderline personality disorder]] (BPD). It has also been used to treat mood disorders as well as those who need to change patterns of behavior that are not helpful, such as [[self-harm]], [[suicidal ideation]], and [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/an-overview-of-dialectical-behavior-therapy/0001096|title=An Overview of Dialectical Behavior Therapy – Psych Central|date=17 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=2015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach is designed to help people increase their emotional and cognitive regulation by learning about the triggers that lead to reactive states and helping to assess which coping skills to apply in the sequence of events, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to help avoid undesired reactions.

A modified form of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), DBT was developed in the late 1980s by [[Marsha M. Linehan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What is DBT? |url=http://behavioraltech.org/resources/whatisdbt.cfm |publisher=The Linehan Institute |accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; a psychology researcher at the [[University of Washington]], to treat people with borderline personality disorder  and chronically suicidal individuals.

DBT combines standard cognitive behavioral techniques for [[Emotional self-regulation|emotion regulation]] and reality-testing with concepts of [[distress tolerance]], acceptance, and [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindful awareness]] largely derived from [[Buddhist]] meditative practice. DBT is based upon the biosocial theory and is the first therapy that has been experimentally demonstrated to be generally effective in treating BPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Linehan | first1 = M.

==Overview==
Linehan observed "burn-out" in therapists after coping with "non-motivated" patients who repudiated cooperation in successful treatment. Her first core insight was to recognize that the chronically suicidal patients she studied had been raised in profoundly invalidating environments, and, therefore, required a climate of [[Mettā|loving-kindness]] and somewhat unconditional acceptance (not [[Carl Rogers]]' positive [[Humanistic psychology|humanist]] approach, but [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]]'s metaphysically neutral one), in which to develop a successful [[therapeutic alliance]].&lt;ref name="loving kindness" group="note"/&gt; Her second insight involved the need for a commensurate commitment from patients, who needed to be willing to accept their dire level of emotional dysfunction.

DBT strives to have the patient view the therapist as an [[allies|ally]] rather than an [[enemy|adversary]] in the treatment of psychological issues.  Accordingly, the therapist aims to accept and validate the client's feelings at any given time, while, nonetheless, informing the client that some feelings and behaviors are [[maladaptive]], and showing them better alternatives.&lt;ref name=nutshell/&gt;  DBT focuses on the client acquiring new skills and changing their behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Choi-Kain|first1=Lois W.|last2=Finch|first2=Ellen F.|last3=Masland|first3=Sara R.|last4=Jenkins|first4=James A.|last5=Unruh|first5=Brandon T.|title=What Works in the Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder|journal=Current Behavioral Neuroscience Reports|date=3 February 2017|volume=4|issue=1|pages=21–30|doi=10.1007/s40473-017-0103-z|pmid=28331780|pmc=5340835}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the ultimate goal of achieving a "life worth living", as defined by the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)?|url=https://behavioraltech.org/resources/faqs/dialectical-behavior-therapy-dbt/|website=Behavioral Tech|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In DBT's biosocial theory of BPD, clients have a biological predisposition for [[emotional dysregulation]], and their social environment validates maladaptive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Little|first1=Hannah|last2=Tickle|first2=Anna|last3=das Nair|first3=Roshan|title=Process and impact of dialectical behaviour therapy: A systematic review of perceptions of clients with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder|journal=Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice|date=16 October 2017|doi=10.1111/papt.12156|pmid=29034599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linehan and others combined a commitment to the core conditions of [[Acceptance and commitment therapy|acceptance and change]] through the  principle of [[dialectic]]s (in which thesis and antithesis are synthesized) and assembled an array of skills for emotional self-regulation drawn from Western psychological traditions, such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] and an interpersonal variant, "[[assertiveness]] training", and Eastern meditative traditions, such as [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|Buddhist mindfulness meditation]]. One of her contributions was to alter the adversarial nature of the therapist-client relationship in favor of an alliance based on [[intersubjective]] [[tough love]].

All DBT can be said to involve 4 components:
*Individual – The therapist and patient discuss issues that come up during the week (recorded on diary cards) and follow a treatment target hierarchy. [[Self-harm|Self-injurious]] and [[suicide|suicidal]] behaviors, or life-threatening behaviors, take first priority. Second in priority are behaviors which, while not directly harmful to self or others, interfere with the course of treatment. These behaviors are known as [[Therapy interfering behavior|therapy-interfering behaviors]]. Third in priority are [[quality of life]] issues and working towards improving one's life generally. During the individual therapy, the therapist and patient work towards improving skill use. Often, a skills group is discussed and obstacles to acting skillfully are addressed.
*Group – A group ordinarily meets once weekly for two to two and a half hours and learns to use specific skills that are broken down into four skill modules: core [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]], interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance.
*Therapist Consultation Team – A therapist consultation team includes all therapists providing DBT.  The meeting occurs weekly and serves to support the therapist in providing the treatment.
*Phone Coaching – Phone coaching is designed to help generalize skills into the patient's daily life. Phone coaching is brief and limited to a focus on skills.

No one component is used by itself; the individual component is considered necessary to keep suicidal urges or uncontrolled emotional issues from disrupting group sessions, while the group sessions teach the skills unique to DBT, and also provide practice with regulating emotions and behavior in a [[Therapeutic community|social context]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}  DBT skills training alone is being used to address treatment goals in some clinical settings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valentine|first1=Sarah E.|last2=Bankoff|first2=Sarah M.|last3=Poulin|first3=Renée M.|last4=Reidler|first4=Esther B.|last5=Pantalone|first5=David W.|title=The Use of Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training as Stand-Alone Treatment: A Systematic Review of the Treatment Outcome Literature|journal=[[Journal of Clinical Psychology]]|date=January 2015|volume=71|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1002/jclp.22114}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the broader goal of [[emotion regulation]] that is seen in DBT has allowed it to be used in new settings, for example, supporting [[parenting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zalewski|first1=Maureen|last2=Lewis|first2=Jennifer K|last3=Martin|first3=Christina Gamache|title=Identifying novel applications of dialectical behavior therapy: considering emotion regulation and parenting|journal=[[Current Opinion in Psychology]]|date=June 2018|volume=21|pages=122–126|doi=10.1016/j.copsyc.2018.02.013|pmid=29529427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mindfulness ===
[[File:Mindfulness1.png|right|thumb|A diagram used in DBT, showing that the Wise Mind is the overlap of the emotional mind and the reasonable mind.]]
{{further|Mindfulness (psychology)}}
Mindfulness is one of the core ideas behind all elements of DBT.  It is considered a foundation for the other skills taught in DBT, because it helps individuals accept and tolerate the powerful emotions they may feel when challenging their habits or exposing themselves to upsetting situations. The concept of mindfulness and the meditative exercises used to teach it are derived from traditional [[Buddhist]] practice, though the version taught in DBT does not involve any religious or [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] concepts. Within DBT it is the capacity to pay attention, nonjudgmentally, to the present moment; about living in the moment, experiencing one's emotions and senses fully, yet with perspective. The practice of mindfulness can also be intended to make people more aware of their environments through their 5 senses: touch, smell, sight, taste, and sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linehaninstitute.org/mindfulness/|title=What is Mindfulness? – The Linehan Institute|website=www.linehaninstitute.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness relies heavily on the principle of acceptance, sometimes referred to as "radical acceptance".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Acceptance skills rely on the patient’s ability to view situations with no judgment, and to accept situations and their accompanying emotions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This causes less distress overall, which can result in reduced discomfort and symptomology.

==== Acceptance and Change ====
The first few sessions of DBT introduce the dialectic of acceptance and change. The patient must first become comfortable with the idea of therapy; once the patient and therapist have established a trusting relationship, DBT techniques can flourish. An essential part of learning acceptance is to first grasp the idea of radical acceptance: radical acceptance embraces the idea that one should face situations, both positive and negative, without judgment.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://behavioraltech.org/downloads/Research-on-DBT_Summary-of-Data-to-Date.pdf|title=DBT Skills Training Manual|last=Linehan|first=Marsha M.|date=2014|website=www.guilford.com|publisher=Guilford Press|access-date=11 December 2016|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptance also incorporates mindfulness and emotional regulation skills, which depend on the idea of radical acceptance. These skills, specifically, are what set DBT apart from other therapies.

Often, after a patient becomes familiar with the idea of acceptance, they will accompany it with change. DBT has five specific states of change which the therapist will review with the patient: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/955646721|title=The dialectical behavior therapy skills workbook for bulimia using DBT to break the cycle and regain control of your life|last=Ellen.|first=Astrachan-Fletcher,|date=2009|publisher=New Harbinger Publications|isbn=9781608822560|oclc=955646721}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Precontemplation is the first stage, in which the patient is completely unaware of their problem. In the second stage, contemplation, the patient realizes the reality of their illness: this is not an action, but a realization. It is not until the third stage, preparation, that the patient is likely to take action, and prepares to move forward. This could be as simple as researching or contacting therapists. Finally, in stage 4, the patient takes action and receives treatment. In the final stage, maintenance, the patient must strengthen their change in order to prevent relapse. After grasping acceptance and change, a patient can fully advance to mindfulness techniques.

===="What" skills====
;Observe
:This is used to nonjudgmentally observe one's environment within or outside oneself. It is helpful in understanding what is going on in any given situation.

:DBT recommends developing a "teflon mind", the ability to let feelings and experiences pass without sticking in the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Young |first=Kathleen |title=Mindfulness and DBT: "What skills" |work=Dr. Kathleen Young: Treating Trauma in Tucson |date=2010-03-11&lt;!--|accessdate=2013-12-20--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Describe
:This is used to express what one has observed with the observe skill. It is to be used without judgmental statements. This helps with letting others know what one has observed. Once the environment or inner state of mind has been observed with 5 senses, the individual can put words to observations and thus better understand the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cogbtherapy.com/cbt-blog/dbt-mindfulness-what-skills|title=Core Mindfulness in Dialectical Behavior Therapy|last=|first=|date=2013-02-15|work=GoodTherapy.org Therapy Blog|access-date=2017-09-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Participate
:This is used to become fully focused on, and involved in, the activity that one is doing.

===="How" skills====
How to do Mindful Meditation.  There are many "scripted" meditations available on YouTube;  for example:  The 3 Minute Meditation;  or The Body Scan.  How to do it (The Body Scan):  You listen to the body scan and you allow your mind to focus on each aspect of your physical self, usually starting at your toes and ending at the top of your head.  As you listen to the body scan and allow your mind to focus in on the body, you will notice your "busy mind" will come into consciousness.  You will notice that thoughts and feelings will attempt to distract you from focusing on each part of your body.  You will notice that some of the thoughts and feelings may be distressing to you.  You may want to stop the meditation because it might be very painful emotionally or physically or because you are having negative or busy thoughts.  Sometimes memories may surface and they may also be difficult emotionally to accept.  How to do Mindful Meditation involves learning to acknowledge the thoughts, feelings and memories without needing to fight them or chase them away.  The paradox:  If we try to fight them, they seem to get bigger;  but when we move into acceptance, they seem to get smaller.  We enter the mindfulness meditation body scan, 3 minute meditation or other meditation sessions with no goals and with a non-striving stance.  Again, if we enter with a goal to "fix my problems by meditating", that goal and pressure to fix something tends to make the problems bigger.  To enter the meditation with a non-goal/non-striving attitude, so having no expectations, paradoxically, usually results in a reduction of stress, pain and other symptoms.
;Nonjudgmentally
:This is the action of describing the facts, and not thinking in terms of "good" or "bad," "fair," or "unfair." These are judgments, not factual descriptions. Being nonjudgmental helps you to get your point across in an effective manner without adding a judgment that someone else might disagree with.

;One-mindfully
:This is used to focus on one thing. One-mindfully is helpful in keeping one's mind from straying into "emotion" by a lack of focus.

;Effectively
:This is simply doing what works. It is a very broad-ranged skill and can be applied to any other skill to aid in being successful with said skill.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dbtselfhelp.com/html/dbt_skills_list.html| title=DBT Skills List | accessdate= 2010-04-26| author=Lisa Dietz| year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distress tolerance===
{{further|Distress tolerance}}
Many current approaches to mental health treatment focus on changing distressing events and circumstances such as dealing with the death of a loved one, loss of a job, serious illness, terrorist attacks and other traumatic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Road To Resiliance" Article: What is resilience?|publisher=American Psychological Association|url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/road-resilience.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have paid little attention to accepting, finding meaning for, and tolerating distress.  This task has generally been tackled by person-centered, [[psychodynamic therapy|psychodynamic]], [[psychoanalytic therapy|psychoanalytic]], [[gestalt therapy|gestalt]], or [[narrative therapy|narrative]] therapies, along with religious and spiritual communities and leaders.  Dialectical behavior therapy emphasizes learning to bear pain skillfully.

Distress tolerance skills constitute a natural development from DBT mindfulness skills.  They have to do with the ability to accept, in a non-evaluative and nonjudgmental fashion, both oneself and the current situation.  Since this is a non-judgmental stance, this means that it is not one of approval or resignation. The goal is to become capable of calmly recognizing negative situations and their impact, rather than becoming overwhelmed or hiding from them. This allows individuals to make wise decisions about whether and how to take action, rather than falling into the intense, desperate, and often destructive emotional reactions that are part of borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

;Distract with ACCEPTS
:This is a skill used to distract oneself temporarily from unpleasant emotions.

:*'''A'''ctivities – Use positive activities that you enjoy.
:*'''C'''ontribute – Help out others or your community.
:*'''C'''omparisons – Compare yourself either to people that are less fortunate or to how you used to be when you were in a worse state.
:*'''E'''motions (other) – cause yourself to feel something different by provoking your sense of humor or happiness with corresponding activities.
:*'''P'''ush away – Put your situation on the back-burner for a while. Put something else temporarily first in your mind.
:*'''T'''houghts (other) – Force your mind to think about something else.
:*'''S'''ensations (other) – Do something that has an intense feeling other than what you are feeling, like a cold shower or a spicy candy.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

;Self-soothe
:This is a skill in which one behaves in a comforting, nurturing, kind, and gentle way to oneself. You use it by doing something that is soothing to you. It is used in moments of distress or agitation.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt; [[New York Jets]] wide receiver [[Brandon Marshall]], who was diagnosed with BPD in 2011 and is a strong advocate for DBT, cited activities such as prayer and listening to jazz music as instrumental in his treatment.

;IMPROVE the moment
:This skill is used in moments of distress to help one relax.

:*'''I'''magery – Imagine relaxing scenes, things going well, or other things that please you.
:*'''M'''eaning – Find some purpose or meaning in what you are feeling.
:*'''P'''rayer – Either pray to whomever you worship, or, if not religious, chant a personal mantra.
:*'''R'''elaxation – Relax your muscles, breathe deeply; use with self-soothing.
:*'''O'''ne thing in the moment – Focus your entire attention on what you are doing right now. Keep yourself in the present.
:*'''V'''acation (brief) – Take a break from it all for a short period of time.
:*'''E'''ncouragement – Cheerlead yourself. Tell yourself you can make it through this and cope as it will assist your resilience and reduce your vulnerability.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

;[[Decisional balance sheet|Pros and cons]]
:Think about the positive and negative things about not tolerating distress.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

;Radical acceptance
:Let go of fighting reality. Accept your situation for what it is.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

;Turning the mind
:Turn your mind toward an acceptance stance. It should be used with radical acceptance.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

;Willingness vs. willfulness
:Be willing and open to do what is effective. Let go of a willful stance which goes against acceptance. Keep your eye on the goal in front of you.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

===Emotion regulation===
{{further|Emotional self-regulation}}
Individuals with borderline personality disorder and suicidal individuals are frequently emotionally intense and [[labile affect|labile]]. They can be angry, intensely frustrated, depressed, or anxious.  This suggests that these clients might benefit from help in learning to regulate their emotions. Dialectical behavior therapy skills for emotion regulation include:&lt;ref&gt;Stone, M.H. (1987) In A. Tasman, R. E. Hales, &amp; A. J. Frances (eds.), ''American Psychiatric Press review of psychiatry'' (vol. 8, pp. 103–122). Washington DC: American Psychiatric Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Holmes, P.|author2=Georgescu, S.|author3=Liles, W.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title=Further delineating the applicability of acceptance and change to private responses: The example of dialectical behavior therapy|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=7|issue=3|pages=301–311|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/7/3/311.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Identify and label emotions
*Identify obstacles to changing emotions
*Reduce vulnerability to ''emotion mind''
*Increase positive emotional events
*Increase mindfulness to current emotions
*Take opposite action
*Apply distress tolerance techniques&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

Emotional regulation skills are based on the theory that intense emotions are a conditioned response to troublesome experiences, the conditioned stimulus, and therefore, are required to alter the patient’s conditioned response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These skills can be categorized into four modules: understanding and naming emotions, changing unwanted emotions, reducing vulnerability, and managing extreme conditions:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

* '''Learning how to understand and name emotions:''' the patient focuses on recognizing their feelings. This segment relates directly to mindfulness, which also exposes a patient to their emotions. 
* '''Changing unwanted emotions:''' the therapist emphasizes the use of opposite-reactions, fact-checking, and problem solving to regulate emotions. While using opposite-reactions, the patient targets distressing feelings by responding with the opposite emotion. 
* '''Reducing vulnerability:''' the patient learns to accumulate positive emotions and to plan coping mechanisms in advance, in order to better handle difficult experiences in the future. 
* '''Managing extreme conditions:''' the patient focuses on incorporating their use of mindfulness skills to their current emotions, in order to remain stable and alert in a crisis situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Story of emotion====
:This skill is used to understand what kind of emotion one is feeling.
:#Prompting event
:#Interpretation of the event
:#Body sensations
:#Body language
:#Action urge
:#Action
:#Emotion name, based on previous items on list&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

====PLEASE====
:This skill concerns ineffective health habits can make one more vulnerable to emotion mind. This skill is used to maintain a healthy body, so one is more likely to have healthy emotions.

::'''P'''hysica'''L''' illness (treat) – If you are sick or injured, get proper treatment for it.
::'''E'''ating (balanced) – Make sure you eat a proper healthy diet, and eat in moderation.
::'''A'''void mood-altering drugs – Do not take other non-prescribed medication or drugs. They may be very harmful to your body, and can make your mood unpredictable.
::'''S'''leep (balanced) – Do not sleep too much or too little. Eight hours of sleep is recommended per night for the average adult.
::'''E'''xercise – Make sure you get an effective amount of exercise, as this will both improve body image and release [[endorphin]]s, making you happier.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

====Build mastery====
:Try to do one thing a day to help build competence and control.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

====Opposite action====
:This skill is used when you have an unjustified emotion, one that doesn't belong in the situation at hand. You use it by doing the opposite of your urges in the moment. It is a tool to bring you out of an unwanted or unjustified emotion by replacing it with the emotion that is opposite.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

====Problem solving====
:This is used to solve a problem when your emotion is justified. It is used in combination with other skills.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

====Letting go of emotional suffering====
:Observe and experience your emotion, accept it, then let it go.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;

===Interpersonal effectiveness===
Interpersonal response patterns taught in DBT skills training are very similar to those taught in many assertiveness and interpersonal problem-solving classes.  They include effective strategies for asking for what one needs, saying no, and coping with interpersonal conflict.

Individuals with [[borderline personality disorder]] frequently possess good interpersonal skills in a general sense. The problems arise in the application of these skills to specific situations. An individual may be able to describe effective behavioral sequences when discussing another person encountering a problematic situation, but may be completely incapable of generating or carrying out a similar behavioral sequence when analyzing their own situation.

The interpersonal effectiveness module focuses on situations where the objective is to change something (e.g., requesting that someone do something) or to resist changes someone else is trying to make (e.g., saying no). The skills taught are intended to maximize the chances that a person's goals in a specific situation will be met, while at the same time not damaging either the relationship or the person's self-respect.

;DEEAR MAN – conveying one's needs to another person
:This acronym is used to aid one in getting what one wants when asking.
:*'''D'''escribe one's situation using specific factual statements about a recent situation.
:*'''E'''xpress the emotions experienced when the situation occurred, why this is an issue and how one feels about it.
:*'''E'''mpathy acknowledge what the other person experienced and their emotions
:*'''A'''ssert one's self by asking clearly and specifically for what behavior change the person seeks.
:*'''R'''einforce one's position by offering a positive consequence if one were to get what one wants.
:*'''M'''indful of the situation by focusing on what one wants and disregard distractions through validation/empathy and redirecting back to the point.
:*'''A'''ppear confident and assertive, even if one doesn't feel confident.
:*'''N'''egotiate with a hesitant person and come to a comfortable compromise on one's request.

;GIVE – giving something
:This skill set aids one maintaining one's relationships, whether they are with friends, co-workers, family, romantic partners, etc. It is to be used in conversations.
:*'''G'''entle: Use appropriate language, no verbal or physical attacks, no put downs, avoid sarcasm unless one is sure the person is alright with it, and be courteous and non-judgmental.
:*'''I'''nterested: When the person one is speaking to is talking about something, act interested in what is being said. Maintain eye contact, ask questions, etc. Avoid the use of a cell phone during an in-person conversation.
:*'''V'''alidate: Show understanding and sympathy of a person's situation. Validation can be shown through words, body language and/or facial expressions.
:*'''E'''asy Manner: Be calm and comfortable during conversation; use humor; smile.

;FAST – keeping [[Self-esteem|self-respect]]
:This is a skill to aid one in maintaining one's self-respect. It is to be used in combination with the other interpersonal effectiveness skills.
:*'''F'''air: Be fair to both oneself and the other person.
:*'''A'''pologies (few): Don't apologize more than once for what one has done ineffectively or for something that was ineffective.
:*'''S'''tick to One's Values: Stay true to what one believes in and stand by it. Don't allow others to encourage action against one's own values.
:*'''T'''ruthful: Don't lie. Lying can only pile up and damage relationships and one's self-respect.&lt;ref name=DBTSkills/&gt;
This list does not include the "problem solving" module, the purpose of which is to practice being one's own therapist.

=== Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ===
Exposure to [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|Complex trauma]], or the experience of traumatic events, can lead to the development of Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) in an individual.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heide|first=F.

The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) does not recognize it in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]-5 (Diagnostical and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the manual used by providers to diagnose, treat and discuss mental illness), though some practitioners argue that CPTSD is separate from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|Posttraumatic Stress Disorder]](PTSD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bryant|first=Richard A.|date=August 2010|title=The Complexity of Complex PTSD|url=https://psychiatryonline.org/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fpsychiatryonline.org%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1176%2Fappi.ajp.2010.10040606|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=167|issue=8|pages=879–881|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10040606|issn=0002-953X}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPTSD is similar to PTSD in that its symptomatology is pervasive and includes cognitive, emotional, and biological domains, among others.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson-Morrison|first=Debra|date=2017|title=Integrative play therapy with adults with complex trauma: A developmentally-informed approach.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/pla0000036|journal=International Journal of Play Therapy|language=en|volume=26|issue=3|pages=172–183|doi=10.1037/pla0000036|issn=1939-0629}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPTSD differs from PTSD in that it is believed to originate in childhood interpersonal trauma, or chronic childhood stress&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, and that the most common precedents are sexual traumas.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maercker|first=Andreas|last2=Hecker|first2=Tobias|last3=Augsburger|first3=Mareike|last4=Kliem|first4=Sören|date=January 2018|title=ICD-11 Prevalence Rates of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in a German Nationwide Sample|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/nmd.0000000000000790|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|pages=1|doi=10.1097/nmd.0000000000000790|issn=0022-3018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the prevalence rate for CPTSD is an estimated .5%, while PTSD's is 1.5%.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Numerous definitions for CPTSD exist. Different versions are contributed by the World Health Organization ([[World Health Organization|WHO]]), The International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies ([[International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies|ISTSS]]), and individual clinicians and researchers. Most definitions revolve around criteria for PTSD with the addition of several other domains. While The APA may not recognize CPTSD, the WHO has recognized this syndrome in its 11th edition of the [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD-11). The WHO defines CPTSD as a disorder following a single or multiple events which cause the individual to feel stressed or trapped, characterized by low self-esteem, interpersonal deficits, and deficits in affect regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=International Classification of Diseases|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springerreference_182865|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deficits in affect regulation, among other symptoms are a reason why CPTSD is sometimes compared with [[Borderline personality disorder|Borderline Personality Disorder]] (BPD).  

==== Similarities Between CPTSD and Borderline Personality Disorder ====
In addition to [[Emotional dysregulation|affect dysregulation]], case studies reveal that patients with CPTSD can also exhibit [[Splitting (psychology)|Splitting]], mood swings, and fears of abandonment.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawson|first=David M.|date=2017-06-21|title=Treating Adults With Complex Trauma: An Evidence-Based Case Study|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcad.12143|journal=Journal of Counseling &amp; Development|language=en|volume=95|issue=3|pages=288–298|doi=10.1002/jcad.12143|issn=0748-9633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like patients with Borderline Personality Disorder, patients with CPTSD were traumatized frequently and/or early in their development and never learned proper coping mechanisms. These individuals may use avoidance, substances, dissociation, and other maladaptive behaviors to cope.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Thus, treatment for CPTSD involves stabilizing and teaching successful coping behaviors, affect regulation, and creating and maintaining interpersonal connections.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition to sharing symptom presentations, CPTSD and BPD can share neurophysiological similarities. For example, abnormal volume of the [[amygdala]] (emotional memory), [[hippocampus]] (memory), [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (emotion), and orbital prefrontal cortex (personality).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Julian D|last2=Courtois|first2=Christine A|date=2014|title=Complex PTSD, affect dysregulation, and borderline personality disorder|url=https://bpded.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2051-6673-1-9|journal=Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation|language=En|volume=1|issue=1|pages=9|doi=10.1186/2051-6673-1-9|issn=2051-6673|pmc=4579513|pmid=26401293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another shared characteristic between CPTSD and BPD is the possibility for [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]]. Further research is needed to determine the reliability of dissociation as a hallmark of CPTSD, however it is a possible symptom.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Because of the two disorders’ shared symptomatology and physiological correlates, psychologists began hypothesizing that a treatment which was effective for one disorder may be effective for the other as well.

==== DBT as a Treatment for CPTSD ====
DBT’s use of acceptance and goal orientation as an approach to behavior change can help to instill empowerment and engage individuals in the therapeutic process. The focus on the future and change can help to prevent the individual from becoming from overwhelmed by their history of trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fasulo|first=Samuel J.|last2=Ball|first2=Joanna M.|last3=Jurkovic|first3=Gregory J.|last4=Miller|first4=Alec L.|date=April 2015|title=Towards the Development of an Effective Working Alliance: The Application of DBT Validation and Stylistic Strategies in the Adaptation of a Manualized Complex Trauma Group Treatment Program for Adolescents in Long-Term Detention|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.2015.69.2.219|journal=American Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=69|issue=2|pages=219–239|doi=10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.2015.69.2.219|issn=0002-9564}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a risk especially with CPTSD, as multiple traumas are common within this diagnosis. Generally, care providers address a client’s suicidality before moving on to other aspects of treatment. Because PTSD can make an individual more likely to experience suicidal ideation&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krysinska|first=Karolina|last2=Lester|first2=David|date=2010-01-29|title=Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Suicide Risk: A Systematic Review|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F13811110903478997|journal=Archives of Suicide Research|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.1080/13811110903478997|issn=1381-1118}}&lt;/ref&gt;, DBT can be an option to stabilize suicidality and aid in other treatment modalities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

Some critics argue that while DBT can be used to treat CPTSD, it is not significantly more effective than standard PTSD treatments. Further, this argument posits that DBT decreases self-injurious behaviors (such as cutting or burning) and increases interpersonal functioning but neglects core CPTSD symptoms such as impulsivity, [[Schema (psychology)|cognitive schemas]] (repetitive, negative thoughts), and emotions such as guilt and shame.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The ISTSS reports that CPTSD requires treatment which differs from typical PTSD treatment, using a multiphase model of recovery, rather than focusing on traumatic memories.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The recommended multiphase model consists of establishing safety, distress tolerance, and social relations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because DBT has four modules which generally align with these guidelines (Mindfulness, Distress Tolerance, Affect Regulation, Interpersonal Skills) it is a treatment option. Other critiques of DBT discuss the time required for the therapy to be effective.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landes|first=Sara J.|last2=Garovoy|first2=Natara D.|last3=Burkman|first3=Kristine M.|date=2013-03-25|title=Treating Complex Trauma Among Veterans: Three Stage-Based Treatment Models|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.21988|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|language=en|volume=69|issue=5|pages=523–533|doi=10.1002/jclp.21988|issn=0021-9762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals seeking DBT may not be able to commit to the individual and group sessions required, or their insurance may not cover every session.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Approximately 56% of individuals diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder also meet criteria for PTSD.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyers|first=Laura|last2=Voller|first2=Emily K.|last3=McCallum|first3=Ethan B.|last4=Thuras|first4=Paul|last5=Shallcross|first5=Sandra|last6=Velasquez|first6=Tina|last7=Meis|first7=Laura|date=2017-03-22|title=Treating Veterans With PTSD and Borderline Personality Symptoms in a 12-Week Intensive Outpatient Setting: Findings From a Pilot Program|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jts.22174|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress|language=en|volume=30|issue=2|pages=178–181|doi=10.1002/jts.22174|issn=0894-9867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the correlation between Borderline Personality Disorder traits and trauma, some settings began using DBT as a treatment for traumatic symptoms.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steil|first=Regina|last2=Dittmann|first2=Clara|last3=Müller-Engelmann|first3=Meike|last4=Dyer|first4=Anne|last5=Maasch|first5=Anne-Marie|last6=Priebe|first6=Kathlen|date=January 2018|title=Dialectical behaviour therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder related to childhood sexual abuse: a pilot study in an outpatient treatment setting|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F20008198.2018.1423832|journal=European Journal of Psychotraumatology|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1423832|doi=10.1080/20008198.2018.1423832|issn=2000-8198|pmc=5774406|pmid=29372016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some providers opt to combine DBT with other PTSD interventions, such as [[Prolonged exposure therapy|Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE)]] (repeated, detailed description of the trauma in a psychotherapy session) or [[Cognitive processing therapy|Cognitive Processing Therapy (]]CPT) (psychotherapy which addresses cognitive schemas related to traumatic memories). For example, a regimen which combined PE and DBT would include teaching mindfulness skills and distress tolerance skills, then implementing PE. The individual with the disorder would then be taught acceptance of a trauma's occurrence and how it may continue to affect them throughout their lives.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Participants of clinical trials such as these exhibited a decrease in symptoms, and throughout the 12-week trial, no self-injurious or suicidal behaviors were reported.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Another argument which supports the use of DBT as a treatment for trauma hinges upon PTSD symptoms such as emotion regulation and distress. Some PTSD treatments such as exposure therapy may not be suitable for individuals whose distress tolerance and/or emotion regulation is low.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Amy W.|last2=Rizvi|first2=Shireen L.|last3=Harned|first3=Melanie S.|date=2007|title=Applications of dialectical behavior therapy to the treatment of complex trauma-related problems: When one case formulation does not fit all|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jts.20268|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=391–400|doi=10.1002/jts.20268|issn=0894-9867}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biosocial theory]] posits that emotion dysregulation is caused by an individual’s heightened emotional sensitivity combined with environmental factors (such as invalidation of emotions, continued abuse/trauma), and tendency to [[Rumination (psychology)|ruminate]] (repeatedly think about a negative event and how the outcome could have been changed).&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Florez|first=Ivonne Andrea|last2=Bethay|first2=J.

Noteworthy is that DBT has often been modified based on the population being treated. For example, in veteran populations DBT is modified to include exposure exercises and accommodate the presence of [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI), and insurance coverage (ie shortening treatment).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denckla|first=Christy A.|last2=Bailey|first2=Robert|last3=Jackson|first3=Christie|last4=Tatarakis|first4=John|last5=Chen|first5=Cory K.|date=November 2015|title=A Novel Adaptation of Distress Tolerance Skills Training Among Military Veterans: Outcomes in Suicide-Related Events|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S107772291400042X|journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Practice|volume=22|issue=4|pages=450–457|doi=10.1016/j.cbpra.2014.04.001|issn=1077-7229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Populations with [[Comorbidity|comorbid]] BPD may need to spend longer in the “Establishing Safety” phase.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In adolescent populations, the skills training aspect of DBT has elicited significant improvement in emotion regulation and ability to express emotion appropriately.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In populations with comorbid substance abuse, adaptations may be made on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Litt|first=Lisa|date=2013-03-26|title=Clinical Decision Making in the Treatment of Complex PTSD and Substance Misuse|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.21989|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|language=en|volume=69|issue=5|pages=534–542|doi=10.1002/jclp.21989|issn=0021-9762}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a provider may wish to incorporate elements of [[Motivational interviewing|Motivational Interviewing]] (psychotherapy which uses empowerment to inspire behavior change). The degree of substance abuse should also be considered. For some individuals, substance use is the only coping behavior they know, and as such the provider may seek to implement skills training before target substance reduction. Inversely, a client’s substance abuse may be interfering with attendance or other treatment compliance and the provider may choose to address the substance use before implementing DBT for the trauma.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2332">'''The doctrine of non-derogation from grants''' is a principle of the [[law of England and Wales]]. As the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] explained in ''[[British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co.]]'', it states that a seller of [[realty]] or goods is not permitted to take any action (such as bringing an infringement action) that will lessen the value to the buyer of the thing sold. 

[[United States federal law]] recognises similar doctrines such as the [[Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law|exhaustion doctrine]] or doctrine of [[implied license]].&lt;ref&gt;A recent decision of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]], ''Transcore, LP v. Electronic Transaction Consultants Corp.'' (F.3d), April 8, 2009, not yet officially reported, conflates these doctrines in the following terms: "TransCore sought to enforce the ’946 patent in derogation of the rights it granted under the TransCore–Mark IV settlement agreement. That attempted derogation is prevented by legal estoppel, which gives rise to the implied license." ''Id''. at -- n.4.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar effect has also been realised in [[United States patent law]] under the doctrine of repair and reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.]]'', 365 U.S. 336 (1961).&lt;/ref&gt;

An important difference between the doctrine of non-derogation from grants and other doctrines, particularly implied license, that are used to accomplish similar results is that the doctrine of non-derogation from grants is "inherent" as a matter of property law and apparently cannot be avoided by a seller's use of language attempting to negative application of the doctrine or by trial counsel's pointing to evidence of intent not to relinquish patent rights or copyright. In contrast, the other doctrines may be vulnerable to contractual disclaimers or evidence of intent not to grant intellectual property rights. The issue is discussed to some extent in the courts' opinions in ''British Leyland'' and ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]''

'''Eroticism''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]  ἔρως, ''[[Eros (love)|eros]]''—"desire") is a quality that causes [[Human sexuality|sexual]] feelings,&lt;ref name=merriam&gt;{{cite web |title=Eroticism|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eroticism|work=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a philosophical contemplation concerning the [[aesthetic]]s of sexual desire, [[sensuality]] and [[romantic love]]. That quality may be found in any form of artwork, including [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[glamor photography|photography]], [[drama]], [[erotic film|film]], [[music]] or [[erotic literature|literature]]. It may also be found in [[Sex in advertising|advertising]]. The term may also refer to a state of [[sexual arousal]]&lt;ref name=merriam /&gt; or anticipation of such – an insistent sexual [[impulse (psychology)|impulse]], [[libido|desire]], or pattern of thoughts.

As French novelist [[Honoré de Balzac]] stated, eroticism is dependent not just upon an individual's [[Sexual ethics|sexual morality]], but also the culture and time in which an individual resides.&lt;ref&gt;Balzac, "The Physiology of Marriage" (1826), trans. Sharon Marcus (1997), Aphorism XXVI, 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grande, L., "Laws and Attitudes towards Homosexuality from Antiquity to the Modern Era", Ponte 43:4-5 (1987), pp. 122-129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gauthier, Albert, "La sodomie dans le droit canonique medieval" in L'Erotisme au Moyen Age: Etudes presentees au IIe Colloque de l'Institut d'Etudes Medievales, 3-4 Avril 1976, ed. Roy, Bruno (Montreal: Ed. Aurore, 1977), pp. 109-122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Because the nature of what is erotic is fluid,&lt;ref&gt;Evans, David T., Sexual Citizenship: The Material Construction of Sexualities, (New York: Routledge, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; early definitions of the term attempted to conceive eroticism as some form of sensual or romantic love or as the human sex drive ([[libido]]); for example, the ''Encyclopédie'' of 1755 states that the erotic "is an epithet which is applied to everything with a connection to the love of the sexes; one employs it particularly to characterize...a dissoluteness, an excess".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopédie'' (1755), quoted in Lynn Hunt ed., ''Eroticism and the Body Politic'' (London 1991) p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because eroticism is wholly dependent on the viewer's culture and personal tastes pertaining to what, exactly, defines the erotic,&lt;ref&gt;Foster. Jeannette H., Sex Variant Women in Literature: A Historical and Quantitative Survey 2nd ed., (New York: Vantage Press, 1956) (repr. Baltimore: Diana Press, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, M., &amp; A. Bell, Homosexuality: An Annotated Bibliography, (New York: 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; critics have often{{how often|date=June 2018}} confused eroticism with [[pornography]], with anti-smut activist [[Andrea Dworkin]] saying, "Erotica is simply high-class pornography; better produced, better conceived, better executed, better packaged, designed for a better class of consumer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pornography: Men Possessing Women |last=Dworkin |first=Andrea |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-399-12619-2 |pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; This confusion, as [[Lynn Hunt]] writes, "demonstrate the difficulty of drawing… a clear generic demarcation between the erotic and the pornographic": indeed arguably "the history of the separation of pornography from eroticism… remains to be written".&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, "Introduction", in Hunt ed., ''Eroticism'' p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological evolution ==
Whereas traditionally eroticism has been dealt with in relation to culture and its pornographic outcomes, current evolutionary psychology shows how eroticism has shaped the evolution of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature|last=Miller|first=Geoffrey|publisher=Vintage|year=2001|isbn=|location=London|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytical approach==
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (8).jpg|thumb|left|An erotic scene from ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' by French illustrator [[Édouard-Henri Avril]]]]
For a [[psychoanalytical]] definition, as early as [[Freud]]&lt;ref&gt;Dollmore, Jonathan, Sexual Dissidence: Ausgutine to Wilde, Freud to Foucault, (Oxford: Clarendon, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; psychotherapists have turned to the ancient Greek philosophy's "overturning of mythology"{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} as a definition to understanding of the heightened [[aesthetic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, "Introduction", in Hunt ed., Eroticism p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Plato]], [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] takes an almost [[transcendent (philosophy)|transcendent]] manifestation when the subject seeks to go beyond itself and form a communion with the objectival other: "the true order of going...to the things of love, is to use the beauties of earth as steps...to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty".&lt;ref&gt;"The Symposium", in Benjamin Jowett trans, ''The Essential Plato'' (1999) p. 746&lt;/ref&gt;

==French philosophy==
Modern French conceptions of eroticism can be traced to [[The Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;Coward, D.A., "Attitudes to Homosexuality in Eighteenth Century France", Journal of European Studies 10, pp. 236 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; when "in the eighteenth century, dictionaries defined the erotic as that which concerned love...eroticism was the intrusion into the public sphere of something that was at base private".&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, "Introduction", in Hunt ed., ''Eroticism'' p. 3 and p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; This theme of intrusion or transgression was taken up in the twentieth century by the French philosopher [[Georges Bataille]], who argued that eroticism performs a function of dissolving boundaries between human subjectivity and humanity, a transgression that dissolves the rational world but is always temporary,&lt;ref&gt;L'érotisme, by Georges Bataille, Paris (1957: UK publication 1962) {{ISBN|978-2-7073-0253-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as that, "Desire in eroticism is the desire that triumphs over the taboo. It presupposes man in conflict with himself".&lt;ref&gt;George Bataille, ''Eroticism'' (Penguin 2001) p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; For Bataille, as well as many French theorists, "Eroticism, unlike simple sexual activity, is a psychological quest...eroticism is assenting to life even in death".&lt;ref&gt;Bataille, ''Eroticism'' p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-heterosexual==

[[Queer theory]] and [[LGBT studies]] consider the concept from a [[non-heterosexual]] perspective, viewing psychoanalytical and modernist views of eroticism as both archaic&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Donald, ed., The Material Queer: A LesBiGay Cultural Studies Reader, (Boulder CO: Westview, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heterosexism|heterosexist]],&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Ed, Talk on the Wilde Side: Towards a Genealogy of a Discourse on Male Sexualities, (New York: Routledge, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; written primarily by and for a "handful of elite, heterosexual, bourgeois men"&lt;ref&gt;Flannigan-Saint-Aubin, Arthur.

[[Audre Lorde]], a Caribbean-American writer and out-spoken [[Feminism|feminist]] talks of the erotic being a type of power being specific to females.  "There are many kinds of power [...] The erotic is a resource within each of us that lies in a deeply female and spiritual plane, firmly rooted in the power of our unexpressed or unrecognized feelings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches |last=Lorde |first=Audre |last2=Clarke |first2=Cheryl |publisher=Ten Speed Press |year=2007 |origyear=1984 |isbn=978-1-58091-186-3 |location=New York |pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Uses of the Erotic" within ''[[Sister Outsider]]'', she discusses how erotic comes from sharing, but if we suppress the erotic rather than recognize its presence, it takes on a different form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3386">In algebra, a '''generic matrix ring''' is a sort of a universal [[matrix ring]].

== Definition ==
We denote by &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; a generic matrix ring of size ''n'' with variables &lt;math&gt;X_1, \dots X_m&lt;/math&gt;. It is characterized by the universal property: given a commutative ring ''R'' and ''n''-by-''n'' matrices &lt;math&gt;A_1, \dots, A_m&lt;/math&gt; over ''R'', any mapping &lt;math&gt;X_i \mapsto A_i&lt;/math&gt; extends to the [[ring homomorphism]] (called evaluation) &lt;math&gt;F_n \to M_n(R)&lt;/math&gt;.

Explicitly, given a field ''k'', it is the subalgebra &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; of the matrix ring &lt;math&gt;M_n(k[(X_l)_{ij}|1 \le l \le m, 1 \le i, j \le n])&lt;/math&gt; generated by ''n''-by-''n'' matrices &lt;math&gt;X_1, \dots, X_m&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(X_l)_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are matrix entries and commute by definition. For example, if ''m'' = 1, then &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial ring in one variable.

For example, a [[central polynomial]] is an element of the ring &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; that will map to a central element under an evaluation. (In fact, it is in the [[invariant ring]] &lt;math&gt;k[(X_l)_{ij}]^{\operatorname{GL}_n(k)}&lt;/math&gt; since it is central and invariant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Artin|1999|loc=Proposition V.15.2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

By definition, &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; is a quotient of the [[free ring]] &lt;math&gt;k\langle t_1, \dots, t_m \rangle&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;t_i \mapsto X_i&lt;/math&gt; by the ideal consisting of all ''p'' that vanish identically on any ''n''-by-''n'' matrices over ''k''.

== Geometric perspective ==
The universal property means that any ring homomorphism from &lt;math&gt;k\langle t_1, \dots, t_m \rangle&lt;/math&gt; to a matrix ring factors through &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt;. This has a following geometric meaning. In algebraic geometry, the polynomial ring &lt;math&gt;k[t, \dots, t_m]&lt;/math&gt; is the coordinate ring of the affine space &lt;math&gt;k^m&lt;/math&gt; and to give a point of &lt;math&gt;k^m&lt;/math&gt; is to give a ring homomorphism (evaluation) &lt;math&gt;k[t, \dots, t_m] \to k&lt;/math&gt; (either by the [[Hilbert nullstellensatz]] or by the [[scheme theory]]). The free ring &lt;math&gt;k\langle t_1, \dots, t_m \rangle&lt;/math&gt; plays the role of the coordinate ring of the affine space in the [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] (i.e., we don't demand free variables to commute) and thus a generic matrix ring of size ''n'' is the coordinate ring of a noncommutative affine variety whose points are the Spec's of matrix rings of size ''n'' (see below for a more concrete discussion.)

=== The maximal spectrum of a generic matrix ring ===
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}

For simplicity, assume ''k'' is algebraically closed. Let ''A'' be an algebra over ''k'' and let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}_n(A)&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of all maximal ideals &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; in ''A'' such that &lt;math&gt;A/\mathfrak{m} \approx M_n(k)&lt;/math&gt;. If ''A'' is commutative, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}_1(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[maximal spectrum]] of ''A'' and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}_n(A)&lt;/math&gt; is empty for any &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

{{about|the philosophical notion of idealism|the ethical principle|Ideal (ethics)|other uses|Idealism (disambiguation)}}
In [[philosophy]], '''Idealism''' is the group of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] philosophies that assert that reality, or reality as humans can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. [[Epistemology|Epistemologically]], Idealism manifests as a [[skepticism]] about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In contrast to [[Materialism]], Idealism asserts the ''primacy'' of consciousness as the origin and prerequisite of material phenomena. According to this view, consciousness exists ''before'' and is the pre-condition of material existence. Consciousness creates and determines the material and not vice versa. Idealism believes consciousness and mind to be the origin of the material world and aims to explain the existing world according to these principles.

Idealism theories are mainly divided into two groups. [[Subjective idealism]] takes as its starting point the given fact of human consciousness seeing the existing world as a combination of sensation. [[Objective idealism]] posits the existence of an ''objective'' consciousness which exists before and, in some sense, independently of human ones. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas—especially beliefs and values—shape society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociology 14th Edition |last=Macionis |first=John J. |year=2012 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-205-11671-3 |page=88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[ontology|ontological]] doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit.&lt;ref name="Brittanica"/&gt; Idealism thus rejects [[physicalism|physicalist]] and [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind.

The earliest extant arguments that the world of experience is grounded in the mental derive from India and Greece. The [[Hindu idealism|Hindu idealists]] in India and the Greek [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] gave [[panentheism|panentheistic]] arguments for an all-pervading consciousness as the ground or true nature of reality.&lt;ref name="Noiré"/&gt; In contrast, the [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] school, which arose within [[Mahayana]] Buddhism in India in the 4th century CE,&lt;ref&gt;Zim, Robert (1995). ''Basic ideas of ''Yogācāra'' Buddhism.'' San Francisco State University. Source: [http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/Yogacara/basicideas.htm] (Retrieved 18 October 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; based its "mind-only" idealism to a greater extent on [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] analyses of personal experience. This turn toward the [[subjective idealism|subjective]] anticipated [[empiricism|empiricists]] such as [[George Berkeley]], who revived idealism in 18th-century Europe by employing skeptical arguments against [[materialism]]. Beginning with [[Immanuel Kant]], [[German idealism|German idealists]] such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] dominated 19th-century philosophy. This tradition, which emphasized the mental or "ideal" character of all phenomena, gave birth to idealistic and [[subjectivism|subjectivist]] schools ranging from [[British idealism]] to [[phenomenalism]] to [[existentialism]].

Idealism as a philosophy came under heavy attack in [[Western world|the West]] at the turn of the 20th century. The most influential critics of both epistemological and ontological idealism were [[G. E. Moore]] and [[Bertrand Russell]],&lt;ref&gt;Sprigge, T. (1998). [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/idealism/v-1 Idealism]. In The Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Taylor and Francis. Retrieved 29 Jun. 2018. DOI: 10.4324/9780415249126-N027-1&lt;/ref&gt; but its critics also included the [[New realism (philosophy)|New Realists]]. According to ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', the attacks by Moore and Russell were so influential that even more than 100 years later "any acknowledgment of idealistic tendencies is viewed in the English-speaking world with reservation". However, many aspects and paradigms of idealism did still have a large influence on subsequent philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

==Definitions==
''Idealism'' is a term with several related meanings. It comes via ''[[idea]]'' from the Greek ''idein'' (ἰδεῖν), meaning "to see". The term entered the English language by 1743.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/90960|title=idealism, n. : Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ordinary use, as when speaking of Woodrow Wilson's [[idealism (international relations)|political idealism]], it generally suggests the priority of ideals, principles, values, and goals over concrete realities. Idealists are understood to represent the world as it might or should be, unlike [[pragmatism|pragmatists]], who focus on the world as it presently is. In the arts, similarly, idealism affirms imagination and attempts to realize a mental conception of beauty, a standard of perfection, juxtaposed to aesthetic [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/idealism|title=Idealism - Define Idealism at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idealism|title=Idealism - Definition of Idealism by Merriam-Webster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any philosophy that assigns crucial importance to the ideal or spiritual realm in its account of human existence may be termed "idealist". [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] idealism is an [[ontology|ontological]] doctrine that holds that reality itself is [[incorporeality|incorporeal]] or experiential at its core. Beyond this, idealists disagree on which aspects of the mental are more basic. [[Platonic idealism]] affirms that [[abstract object|abstractions]] are more basic to reality than the things we perceive, while [[subjective idealism|subjective idealists]] and [[phenomenalism|phenomenalists]] tend to privilege sensory experience over abstract reasoning. [[Epistemology|Epistemological]] idealism is the view that reality can only be known through ideas, that only psychological experience can be apprehended by the mind.&lt;ref name="Brittanica"&gt;Daniel Sommer Robinson, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/281802/idealism "Idealism"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[On The Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer noted the ambiguity of the word ''idealism'', calling it a "term with multiple meanings". For Schopenhauer, idealists seek to account for the relationship between our ideas and external reality, rather than for the nature of reality as such. Non-Kantian idealists, on the other hand, theorized about mental aspects of the reality underlying phenomena.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip J. Neujahr would "restrict the idealist label to theories which hold that the world, or its material aspects, are dependent upon the specifically cognitive activities of the mind or Mind in perceiving or thinking about (or 'experiencing') the object of its awareness." Philip J. Neujahr, ''Kant's Idealism'', Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Subjective idealists like [[George Berkeley]] are [[anti-realism|anti-realists]] in terms of a mind-independent world, whereas [[transcendental idealism|transcendental idealists]] like [[Immanuel Kant]] are strong [[skepticism|skeptics]] of such a world, affirming epistemological and not metaphysical idealism. Thus Kant defines ''idealism'' as "the assertion that we can never be certain whether all of our putative outer experience is not mere imagining".&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, Notes and Fragments, ed. Paul Guyer, trans. by Curtis Bowman, Paul Guyer, and Frederick Rauscher, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 318, {{ISBN|0-521-55248-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that, according to ''idealism'', "the reality of external objects does not admit of strict proof. On the contrary, however, the reality of the object of our internal sense (of myself and state) is clear immediately through consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;''Critique of Pure Reason'', A 38&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all idealists restrict the real or the knowable to our immediate subjective experience. [[Objective idealism|Objective idealists]] make claims about a transempirical world, but simply deny that this world is essentially divorced from or ontologically prior to the mental. Thus, [[Plato]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] affirm an objective and knowable reality transcending our subjective awareness—a rejection of epistemological idealism—but propose that this reality is grounded in ideal entities, a form of metaphysical idealism. Nor do all metaphysical idealists agree on the nature of the ideal; for Plato, the fundamental entities were non-mental abstract [[Platonic idealism|forms]], while for Leibniz they were proto-mental and concrete [[monadology|monads]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Leibniz"&gt;Mark Kulstad and Laurence Carlin, "Leibniz's Philosophy of Mind", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-mind/&lt;/ref&gt;

As a rule, transcendental idealists like Kant affirm idealism's epistemic side without committing themselves to whether reality is ''ultimately'' mental; objective idealists like Plato affirm reality's metaphysical basis in the mental or abstract without restricting their epistemology to ordinary experience; and subjective idealists like Berkeley affirm both metaphysical and epistemological idealism.&lt;ref name="Gron"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.enotes.com/science-religion-encyclopedia/idealism|title=Idealism |author=ARNE GRØN |date= |work=Encyclopedia of Science and Religion |publisher= |accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical idealism==
===Pre-Socratic philosophy===
Idealism as a form of metaphysical [[monism]] holds that consciousness, not matter, is the ground of all being. It is monist because it holds that there is only one type of thing in the universe and idealist because it holds that one thing to be consciousness.

[[Anaxagoras]] (480 BC) taught that "all things" were created by ''[[Nous]]'' ("Mind"). He held that Mind held the cosmos together and gave human beings a connection to the cosmos or a pathway to the divine.

===Platonism and neoplatonism===
[[Plato]]'s [[Theory of Forms|theory of forms]] or "ideas" describes ideal forms (for example the [[platonic solids]] in geometry or abstracts like Goodness and Justice), as [[problem of universals|universals]] existing independently of any particular instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.mdc.edu/jmcnair/Joe6pages/Plato%27s%20Idealism.htm |title=Plato's Idealism |author=J.D.McNair |date= |work=Students' notes |publisher=MIAMI-DADE COMMUNITY COLLEGE |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arne Grøn calls this doctrine "the classic example of a metaphysical idealism as a ''transcendent'' idealism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/science-religion-encyclopedia/idealism |title= Idealism|author= Arne Grøn|date= |work= Encyclopedia of Science and Religion |publisher=eNotes |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Simone Klein calls Plato "the earliest representative of metaphysical objective idealism". Nevertheless, Plato holds that matter is real, though transitory and imperfect, and is perceived by our body and its senses and given existence by the eternal ideas that are perceived directly by our rational soul. Plato was therefore a metaphysical and [[Epistemological dualism|epistemological dualist]], an outlook that modern idealism has striven to avoid:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophos.com/knowledge_base/archives_12/philosophy_questions_12.html |title=What is objective idealism? |author=Simone Klein |date= |work=Philosophy Questions |publisher=Philosophos |accessdate=7 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716085840/http://www.philosophos.com/knowledge_base/archives_12/philosophy_questions_12.html |archive-date=16 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's thought cannot therefore be counted as idealist in the modern sense.

With the [[Neoplatonist]] [[Plotinus]], wrote Nathaniel Alfred Boll "there even appears, probably for the first time in [[Western philosophy]], ''idealism'' that had long been current in the East even at that time, for it taught... that the soul has made the world by stepping from [[eternity]] into [[time]]...".&lt;ref&gt;'For there is for this universe no other place than the soul or mind'&lt;br&gt;''(neque est alter hujus universi locus quam anima)''&lt;br&gt;''Enneads'', iii, lib. vii, c.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''(oportet autem nequaquam extra animam tempus accipere)''&lt;br&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume I, "Fragments for the History of Philosophy," § 7&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in regard to passages from the [[Enneads]], "The only space or place of the world is the soul" and "Time must not be assumed to exist outside the soul".&lt;ref&gt;''Enneads'', iii, 7, 10&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig Noiré wrote: "For the first time in Western philosophy we find idealism proper in Plotinus".&lt;ref name="Noiré"&gt;Ludwig Noiré, ''Historical Introduction to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason''&lt;/ref&gt; However, Plotinus does not address whether we know external objects,{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} unlike Schopenhauer and other modern philosophers.

==Christian philosophy==
[[Christianity|Christian]] theologians have held idealist views,&lt;ref&gt;Snowden, J. (1915). Philosophical Idealism and Christian Theology. The Biblical World, 46(3), 152-158. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/3142477&lt;/ref&gt; often based on [[Neoplatonism]], despite the influence of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[scholasticism]] from the 12th century onward. Later western theistic idealism such as that of [[Hermann Lotze]] offers a theory of the "world ground" in which all things find their unity: it has been widely accepted by Protestant theologians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/648307/world-ground |title=world ground (philosophy) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several modern religious movements, for example the organizations within the [[New Thought Movement]] and the [[Unity Church]], may be said to have a particularly idealist orientation. The [[theology]] of [[Christian Science]] includes a form of idealism: it teaches that all that truly exists is God and God's ideas; that the world as it appears to the senses is a distortion of the underlying spiritual reality, a distortion that may be corrected (both conceptually and in terms of human experience) through a reorientation (spiritualization) of thought.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Chinese philosophy==
[[Wang Yangming]], a Ming Chinese neo-Confucian philosopher, official, educationist, calligraphist and general, held that objects do not exist entirely apart from the mind because the mind shapes them. It is not the world that shapes the mind but the mind that gives reason to the world, so the mind alone is the source of all reason, having an inner light, an innate moral goodness and understanding of what is good.

==Idealism in Vedic and Buddhist thought==
{{Asian philosophy sidebar}}
[[Image:Yajnavalkya_and_Janaka.jpg|thumb|240px|The sage [[Yajnavalkya]] (possibly 8th century) is one of the earliest exponents of idealism, and is a major figure in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]].]]
There are currents of idealism throughout [[Indian philosophy]], ancient and modern. Hindu idealism often takes the form of [[monism]] or [[non-dualism]], espousing the view that a unitary [[consciousness]] is the essence or meaning of the [[Maya (illusion)|phenomenal reality]] and plurality.

Buddhist idealism on the other hand is more epistemic and is not a metaphysical monism, which Buddhists consider eternalistic and hence not the [[middle way]] between extremes espoused by the Buddha.

The oldest reference to Idealism in Vedic texts is in [[Purusha Sukta]] of the [[Rig Veda]]. This sukta espouses [[panentheism]] by presenting cosmic being Purusha as both pervading all universe and yet being transcendent to it.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnananda, Swami. [http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/invoc/in_pura.html Daily Invocations]. Divine Life Society, The Purusha Sukta, Verses 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Absolute idealism can be seen in [[Chāndogya Upaniṣad]], where things of the objective world like the [[Mahābhūta|five elements]] and the subjective world such as will, hope, memory etc. are seen to be emanations from the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Self]].&lt;ref&gt;Nikhilananda, Swami. The Upanishads&amp;nbsp;— A New Translation. [http://www.bharatadesam.com/spiritual/upanishads/chandogya_upanishad.php Chhandogya Upanishad], Parts 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian philosophy===
Idealist notions have been propounded by the [[Vedanta]] schools of thought, which use the Vedas, especially the [[Upanishads]] as their key texts. Idealism was opposed by dualists [[Samkhya]], the atomists [[Vaisheshika]], the logicians [[Nyaya]], the  linguists [[Mimamsa]] and the materialists [[Cārvāka]]. There are various sub schools of Vedanta, like [[Advaita Vedanta]] (non-dual), [[Vishishtadvaita]] and [[Bhedabheda]] Vedanta (difference and non-difference).

The schools of Vedanta all attempt to explain the nature and relationship of [[Brahman]] (universal soul or Self) and [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (individual self), which they see as the central topic of the Vedas. One of the earliest attempts at this was Bādarāyaņa's [[Brahma Sutras]], which is canonical for all Vedanta sub-schools. Advaita Vedanta is a major sub school of Vedanta which holds a non-dual Idealistic metaphysics. According to Advaita thinkers like [[Adi Shankara]] (788–820) and his contemporary [[Maṇḍana Miśra]], Brahman, the single unitary consciousness or absolute awareness, appears as the diversity of the world because of ''maya'' or illusion, and hence perception of plurality is ''mithya'', error. The world and all beings or souls in it have no separate existence from Brahman, universal consciousness, and the seemingly independent soul (''jiva'') is identical to Brahman. These doctrines are represented in verses such as ''brahma satyam jagan mithya; jīvo brahmaiva na aparah'' (Brahman is alone True, and this world of plurality is an error; the individual self is not different from Brahman). Other forms of Vedanta like the [[Vishishtadvaita]] of [[Ramanuja]] and the [[Bhedabheda]] of [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhāskara]] are not as radical in their non-dualism, accepting that there is a certain difference between individual souls and Brahman. [[Dvaita]] school of [[Vedanta]] by [[Madhvacharya]] maintains the opposing view that the world is real and eternal. It also argues that real atman fully depends and reflection of independent brahman. 

The [[Yoga|Tantric]] tradition of [[Kashmir Shaivism]] has also been categorized by scholars as a form of Idealism.&lt;ref&gt;S. G. Dyczkowski, Mark. The Doctrine of Vibration: An Analysis of Doctrines and Practices of Kashmir Shaivism. P. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The key thinker of this tradition is the Kashmirian [[Abhinavagupta]] (975–1025 CE).

Modern Vedic Idealism was defended by the influential Indian philosopher [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] in his 1932 ''An Idealist View of Life'' and other works, which espouse [[Advaita Vedanta]]. The essence of Hindu Idealism is captured by such modern writers as [[Nisargadatta Maharaj|Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj]], [[Sri Aurobindo]], [[P. R. Sarkar]], and [[Sohail Inayatullah]].

===Buddhist philosophy===
[[File:Kofukuji Monastery Hosso Patriarchs of Hokuendo (Seshin) (413).jpg|thumb|Statue of Vasubandhu (jp. Seshin), [[Kōfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], [[Japan]].]]
Buddhist views which can be said to be similar to Idealism appear in [[Mahayana]] Buddhist texts such as the [[Samdhinirmocana sutra]], [[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]], [[Ten Stages Sutra|Dashabhumika sutra]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;ernando Tola, Carmen Dragonetti. Philosophy of mind in the Yogacara Buddhist idealistic school. History of Psychiatry, SAGE Publications, 2005, 16 (4), pp.453-465.&lt;/ref&gt; These were later expanded upon by Indian Buddhist philosophers like [[Vasubandhu]], [[Asaṅga]], [[Dharmakīrti]], and [[Śāntarakṣita]]. Yogacara thought was also promoted in China, by Chinese philosophers and translators like [[Xuanzang]].

There is a modern scholarly disagreement about whether Yogacara Buddhism can be said to be a form of idealism. As Saam Trivedi notes: "on one side of the debate, writers such as Jay Garfield, Jeffrey Hopkins, Paul Williams, and others maintain the idealism label, while on the other side, Stefan Anacker, Dan Lusthaus, Richard King, Thomas Kochumuttom, Alex Wayman, Janice Dean Willis, and others have argued that Yogacara is not idealist."&lt;ref name="Trivedi, Saam 2005, pp. 231"&gt;Trivedi, Saam; Idealism and Yogacara Buddhism. Asian Philosophy Vol. 15, No. 3, November 2005, pp. 231–246&lt;/ref&gt; The central point of issue is what Buddhist philosophers like [[Vasubandhu]] who used the term ''Vijñapti-matra'' (representation-only or cognition-only) and formulated arguments to refute external objects actually meant to say.

Vasubandhu's works include a refutation of external objects or externality itself and argues that the true nature of reality is beyond subject-object distinctions.&lt;ref name="Trivedi, Saam 2005, pp. 231"/&gt; He views ordinary consciousness experience as deluded in its perceptions of an external world separate from itself and instead argues that all there is ''Vijñapti'' (representation or conceptualization).&lt;ref name="Trivedi, Saam 2005, pp. 231"/&gt; Hence Vasubandhu begins his ''Vimsatika'' with the verse: ''All this is consciousness-only, because of the appearance of non-existent objects, just as someone with an optical disorder may see non-existent nets of hair.''&lt;ref name="Trivedi, Saam 2005, pp. 231"/&gt;

Likewise, the Buddhist philosopher Dharmakirti's view of the apparent existence of external objects is summed up by him in the [[Pramanavarttika|Pramānaṿārttika]] (‘Commentary on Logic and Epistemology’): ''Cognition experiences itself, and nothing else whatsoever. Even the particular objects of perception, are by nature just consciousness itself.''&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. Buddhist Idealists and Their Jain Critics On Our Knowledge of External Objects.
Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement / Volume 74 / July 2014, pp 123 - 147
DOI: 10.1017/S1358246114000083, Published online: 30 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

While some writers like Jay Garfield hold that Vasubandhu is a metaphysical idealist, others see him as closer to an epistemic idealist like Kant who holds that our knowledge of the world is simply knowledge of our own concepts and perceptions of a transcendental world. Sean Butler upholding that Yogacara is a form of idealism, albeit its own unique type, notes the similarity of [[Category (Kant)|Kant's categories]] and Yogacara's ''[[Vāsanā]]s'', both of which are simply phenomenal tools with which the mind interprets the noumenal realm.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Idealism in Yogācāra Buddhism, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Kant however who holds that the noumenon or thing-in-itself is unknowable to us, Vasubandhu holds that ultimate reality is knowable, but only through non-conceptual yogic perception of a highly trained meditative mind.&lt;ref name="Trivedi, Saam 2005, pp. 231"/&gt;

Writers like Dan Lusthaus who hold that Yogacara is not a metaphysical idealism point out, for example, that Yogācāra thinkers did not focus on consciousness to assert it as ontologically real, but simply to analyze how our experiences and thus our suffering is created. As Lusthaus notes: "no Indian Yogācāra text ever claims that the world is created by mind. What they do claim is that we mistake our projected interpretations of the world for the world itself, i.e. we take our own mental constructions to be the world."&lt;ref name="acmuller.net"&gt;[[Dan Lusthaus]], "What is and isn't Yogācāra." {{cite web|url=http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216190312/http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm |archivedate=16 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lusthaus notes that there are similarities to Western epistemic idealists like Kant and Husserl, enough so that Yogacara can be seen as a form of epistemological idealism. However he also notes key differences like the concepts of karma and nirvana.&lt;ref name="acmuller.net"/&gt; Saam Trivedi meanwhile notes the similarities between epistemic idealism and Yogacara, but adds that Yogacara Buddhism is in a sense its own theory.&lt;ref name="Trivedi, Saam 2005, pp. 231"/&gt;

Similarly, Thomas Kochumuttom sees Yogacara as "an explanation of experience, rather than a system of ontology" and Stefan Anacker sees Vasubandhu's philosophy as a form of psychology and as a mainly therapeutic enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Kochumuttom, Thomas A. (1999), A buddhist Doctrine of Experience.

==Subjective idealism&lt;!--'Worst argument' redirects here--&gt;==
{{main|Subjective idealism}}
Subjective idealism ([[immaterialism]] or [[phenomenalism]]) describes a relationship between experience and the world in which objects are no more than collections or [[Bundle theory|bundles of sense data]] in the perceiver. Proponents include Berkeley,&lt;ref&gt;" Berkeley's version of Idealism is usually referred to as Subjective Idealism or Dogmatic Idealism" http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_idealism.html&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop of Cloyne, an Anglo-Irish philosopher who advanced a theory he called "[[immaterialism]]," later referred to as "subjective idealism", contending that individuals can only know sensations and ideas of objects directly, not abstractions such as "matter", and that ideas also depend upon being perceived for their very existence - ''esse est percipi''; "to be is to be perceived".

[[Arthur Collier]]&lt;ref&gt;''Clavis Universalis, or A New Inquiry after Truth, being a Demonstration of the NonExistence or Impossibility of an External World'' by Arthur Collier&lt;/ref&gt; published similar assertions though there seems to have been no influence between the two contemporary writers. The only knowable reality is the represented image of an external object. Matter as a cause of that image, is unthinkable and therefore nothing to us. An external world as absolute matter unrelated to an observer does not exist as far as we are concerned. The universe cannot exist as it appears if there is no perceiving mind. Collier was influenced by ''An Essay Towards the Theory of the Ideal or Intelligible World'' by [[Cambridge Platonist]] [[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]] (1701).

[[Bertrand Russell]]'s popular book  ''[[The Problems of Philosophy]]'' highlights Berkeley's tautological premise for advancing idealism;

:"If we say that the things known must be in the mind, we are either unduly limiting the mind's power of knowing, or we are uttering a mere tautology. We are uttering a mere tautology if we mean by 'in the mind' the same as by 'before the mind', i.e. if we mean merely being apprehended by the mind. But if we mean this, we shall have to admit that what, in this sense, is in the mind, may nevertheless be not mental. Thus when we realize the nature of knowledge, Berkeley's argument is seen to be wrong in substance as well as in form, and his grounds for supposing that 'idea', i.e. the objects apprehended-must be mental, are found to have no validity whatever. Hence his grounds in favour of the idealism may be dismissed."

The [[Australians|Austrailian]] philosopher [[David Stove]] harshly criticized philosophical idealism, arguing that it rests on what he called "the '''worst argument'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/worst.html|title=Stove's discovery of the worst argument in the world|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stove claims that Berkeley tried to derive a non-tautological conclusion from tautological reasoning. He argued that in Berkeley's case the [[fallacy]] is not obvious and this is because one premise is ambiguous between one meaning which is [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]] and another which, Stove argues, is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to the conclusion.

[[Alan Musgrave]]&lt;ref&gt;Alan Musgrave, in an article titled ''Realism and Antirealism'' in R. Klee (ed), ''Scientific Inquiry: Readings in the Philosophy of Science'', Oxford, 1998, 344-352 - later re-titled to ''Conceptual Idealism and Stove's Gem'' in A. Musgrave, Essays on Realism and Rationalism, Rodopi, 1999 also in M.L. Dalla Chiara et al. (eds), ''Language, Quantum, Music'', Kluwer, 1999, 25-35 - [[Alan Musgrave]]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that conceptual idealists compound their mistakes with use/mention confusions;

:Santa Claus the person does not exist.
:"Santa Claus" the name/concept/fairy tale does exist because adults tell children this every Christmas season (the distinction is highlighted by using quotation-marks when referring only to the name and not the object)

and proliferation of hyphenated entities such as "thing-in-itself" (Immanuel Kant), "things-as-interacted-by-us" ([[Arthur Fine]]), "table-of-commonsense" and "table-of-physics" (Sir [[Arthur Eddington]]) which are "warning signs" for conceptual idealism according to Musgrave because they allegedly do not exist but only highlight the numerous ways in which people come to know the world. This argument does not take into account the issues pertaining to hermeneutics, especially at the backdrop of analytic philosophy. Musgrave criticized [[Richard Rorty]] and [[postmodernist]] philosophy in general for confusion of use and mention.

[[A. A. Luce]]&lt;ref&gt;Sense Without Matter Or Direct Perception By A.A. Luce&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Foster (philosopher)|John Foster]] are other subjectivists.&lt;ref&gt;Review for John Foster's book ''A World for Us: The Case for Phenomenalistic Idealism'' http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=15785&lt;/ref&gt; Luce, in ''Sense without Matter'' (1954), attempts to bring Berkeley up to date by modernizing his vocabulary and putting the issues he faced in modern terms, and treats the Biblical account of matter and the psychology of perception and nature. Foster's ''The Case for Idealism'' argues that the physical world is the logical creation of natural, non-logical constraints on human [[Empirical evidence|sense-experience]]. Foster's latest defense of his views ([[phenomenalistic idealism]]) is in his book ''A World for Us: The Case for Phenomenalistic Idealism''.

[[Paul Brunton]], a British philosopher, mystic, traveler, and guru, taught a type of idealism called "[[Mentalism (philosophy)|mentalism]]," similar to that of Bishop Berkeley, proposing a master world-image, projected or manifested by a world-mind, and an infinite number of individual minds participating. A tree does not cease to exist if nobody sees it because the world-mind is projecting the idea of the tree to all minds&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stillnessspeaks.com/images/uploaded/file/Paul%20Brunton.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Searle]], criticizing some versions of idealism, summarizes two important arguments for subjective idealism. The first is based on our perception of reality:

:(1) ''All we have access to in perception are the contents of our own experience'' and

:(2) ''The only epistemic basis for claims about the external world are our perceptual experiences''

therefore;

:(3) ''The only reality we can meaningfully speak of is that of perceptual experience&lt;ref&gt;[[John Searle]], ''The Construction of Social Reality'' p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst agreeing with (2) Searle argues that (1) is false and points out that (3) does not follow from (1) and (2). The second argument runs as follows;

:''Premise: Any cognitive state occurs as part of a set of cognitive states and within a cognitive system''

:''Conclusion 1: It is impossible to get outside all cognitive states and systems to survey the relationships between them and the reality they cognize''

:''Conclusion 2: There is no cognition of any reality that exists independently of cognition&lt;ref&gt;[[John Searle]], ''The Construction of Social Reality'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle contends that ''Conclusion 2'' does not follow from the premises.

[[Epistemological idealism]] is a subjectivist position in [[epistemology]] that holds that what one knows about an object exists only in one's mind. Proponents include [[Brand Blanshard]].

==Transcendental idealism==
{{main|Transcendental idealism}}
Transcendental idealism, founded by Immanuel Kant in the eighteenth century, maintains that the mind shapes the world we perceive into the form of space-and-time.

{{Quotation|...&amp;nbsp;if I remove the thinking subject, the whole material world must at once vanish because it is nothing but a phenomenal appearance in the sensibility of ourselves as a subject, and a manner or species of representation.|''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' A383}}

The 2nd edition (1787) contained a ''Refutation of Idealism'' to distinguish his transcendental idealism from [[Descartes]]'s [[Sceptic]]al Idealism and Berkeley's anti-realist strain of [[Subjective Idealism]]. The section ''Paralogisms of Pure Reason'' is an implicit critique of Descartes' idealism. Kant says that it is not possible to infer the 'I' as an object (Descartes' ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'') purely from "the spontaneity of thought". Kant focused on ideas drawn from British philosophers such as [[John Locke|Locke]], Berkeley and [[David Hume|Hume]] but distinguished his transcendental or [[critical idealism]] from previous varieties;

{{Quotation|The dictum of all genuine idealists, from the [[Eleatic]] school to Bishop Berkeley, is contained in this formula: “All knowledge through the [[senses]] and [[experience]] is nothing but sheer [[illusion]], and only in the ideas of the pure [[understanding]] and [[reason]] is there [[truth]].” The principle that throughout dominates and determines my [transcendental] idealism is, on the contrary: “All knowledge of things merely from pure understanding or pure reason is nothing but sheer illusion, and only in experience is there truth.”|''[[Prolegomena]]'', 374}}

Kant distinguished between things as they appear to an observer and things in themselves, "that is, things considered without regard to whether and how they may be given to us".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 140&lt;/ref&gt;  We cannot approach the ''[[noumenon]]'', the "thing in Itself" ({{lang-de|Ding an sich}}) without our own mental world. He added that the mind is not a [[blank slate]], ''tabula rasa'' but rather comes equipped with categories for organising our sense impressions.

In the first volume of his ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Schopenhauer wrote his "Sketch of a [[History]] of the Doctrine of the [[Ideal (ethics)|Ideal]] and the [[The Real|Real]]". He defined the ideal as being mental pictures that constitute subjective [[knowledge]]. The ideal, for him, is what can be attributed to our own minds. The images in our head are what comprise the ideal. Schopenhauer emphasized that we are restricted to our own [[consciousness]]. The [[world]] that appears is only a [[representation (psychology)|representation]] or mental picture of objects. We directly and immediately know only representations. All objects that are external to the mind are known indirectly through the mediation of our mind. He offered a history of the [[concept]] of the "ideal" as "ideational" or "existing in the mind as an image".

{{Quotation|[T]rue philosophy must at all costs be ''idealistic''; indeed, it must be so merely to be honest. For nothing is more certain than that no one ever came out of himself in order to identify himself immediately with things different from him; but everything of which he has certain, sure, and therefore immediate knowledge, lies within his consciousness. Beyond this consciousness, therefore, there can be no ''immediate'' certainty ... There can never be an existence that is objective absolutely and in itself; such an existence, indeed, is positively inconceivable. For the objective, as such, always and essentially has its existence in the consciousness of a subject; it is therefore the subject's representation, and consequently is conditioned by the subject, and moreover by the subject's forms of representation, which belong to the subject and not to the object.|''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. II, Ch. 1}}

[[Charles Bernard Renouvier]] was the first Frenchman after Nicolas Malebranche to formulate a complete idealistic system, and had a vast influence on the development of French thought. His system is based on Immanuel Kant's, as his chosen term "néo-criticisme" indicates; but it is a transformation rather than a continuation of Kantianism.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argued that Kant commits an agnostic [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] and does not offer a satisfactory answer as to the ''source'' of a philosophical right to such-or-other metaphysical claims; he ridicules his pride in tackling "the most difficult thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, ''Beyond Good and Evil'', Part 1 On the Prejudice of Philosophers Section 11; cf. ''On the Genealogy of Morals'', book III, 25, the last paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous "thing-in-itself" was called a product of philosophical habit, which seeks to introduce a grammatical subject: because wherever there is cognition, there must be a ''thing'' that is cognized and allegedly it must be added to ontology as a being (whereas, to Nietzsche, only the world as ever changing appearances can be assumed).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. ''The Will To Power'', 552. [https://archive.org/stream/TheWillToPower-Nietzsche/will_to_power-nietzsche_djvu.txt Online text here]. "At last, the &amp;laquo;thing-in-itself&amp;raquo; also disappears, because this is fundamentally the conception of a &amp;laquo;subject-in-itself&amp;raquo;. But we have grasped that the subject is a fiction. The antithesis &amp;laquo;thing-in-itself&amp;raquo; and &amp;laquo;appearance&amp;raquo; is untenable; with that, however, the concept &amp;laquo;appearance&amp;raquo; also disappears."&lt;/ref&gt; Yet he attacks the idealism of Schopenhauer and [[Descartes]] with an argument similar to Kant's critique of the latter ''(see above)''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. ''The Will To Power'', 477. [https://archive.org/stream/TheWillToPower-Nietzsche/will_to_power-nietzsche_djvu.txt Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective idealism==
{{main|Objective idealism}}
Objective idealism asserts that the reality of experiencing combines and transcends the realities of the object experienced and of the mind of the observer.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary definition http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/objective+idealism&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents include [[Thomas Hill Green]], [[Josiah Royce]], [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_idealism.html|title=Idealism - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absolute idealism===
{{main|Absolute idealism}}

Schelling (1775–1854) claimed that the Fichte's "I" needs the Not-I, because there is no subject without object, and vice versa. So there is no difference between the subjective and the objective, that is, the ideal and the real. This is Schelling's "absolute [[identity (philosophy)|identity]]": the [[idea]]s or mental images in the mind are identical to the extended objects which are external to the mind.

Absolute idealism is G. W. F. Hegel's account of how existence is comprehensible as an all-inclusive whole. Hegel called his philosophy "absolute" idealism in contrast to the "subjective idealism" of Berkeley and the "transcendental idealism" of Kant and Fichte,&lt;ref&gt;One book devoted to showing that Hegel is neither a Berkeleyan nor a Kantian idealist is Kenneth Westphal, ''Hegel's Epistemological Realism'' (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; which were not based on a critique of the finite and a dialectical philosophy of history as Hegel's idealism was. The exercise of reason and intellect enables the philosopher to know ultimate historical reality, the phenomenological constitution of self-determination, the dialectical development of self-awareness and personality in the realm of History.

In his ''Science of Logic'' (1812–1814) Hegel argues that finite qualities are not fully "real" because they depend on other finite qualities to determine them. Qualitative ''infinity'', on the other hand, would be more self-determining and hence more fully real. Similarly finite natural things are less "real"—because they are less self-determining—than spiritual things like morally responsible people, ethical communities and God. So any doctrine, such as materialism, that asserts that finite qualities or natural objects are fully real is mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;An interpretation of Hegel's critique of the finite, and of the "absolute idealism" which Hegel appears to base that critique, is found in Robert M. Wallace, Hegel's Philosophy of Reality, Freedom, and God, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism, in particular Kant's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations.&lt;ref&gt;See Wallace, ''Hegel's Philosophy of Reality, Freedom, and God'', chapter 3, for details on how Hegel might preserve something resembling Kant's dualism of nature and freedom while defending it against skeptical attack.&lt;/ref&gt; For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the "subject" (any human observer) to be able to know any observed "object" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of "subject-object identity," subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural "God") as their ''conceptual'' (not metaphysical) inner reality—and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's "self-realization" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to ''Absolute'' Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every "object" it observes is something "alien," meaning something separate or apart from "subject."  In Hegel's words, "The object is revealed to it [to "subject"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself."&lt;ref&gt;G. W. F. Hegel, ''Phenomenology of Spirit'', trans. A. V. Miller (Oxford: Clarendon, 1977), para. 771; cf. para. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every "object" is ''himself'', because both subject and object are essentially Spirit.  When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes ''Absolute'' Spirit, the "finite" (man, human) becomes the "infinite" ("God," divine), replacing the imaginary or "picture-thinking" supernatural God of [[theism]]: man becomes God.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard F. Wheat, ''Hegel's Undiscovered Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis Dialectics: What Only Marx and Tillich Understood'' (Amherst, NY: Prometheus, 2012), 69, 105-106, 116, 158-59, 160, 291, 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker puts it this way: "Hegelianism . . . is a religion  of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'" The picture Hegel presents is "a picture of a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively, and at the end successfully, to rise to divinity."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Tucker, ''Philosophy and Myth in Karl Marx'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961), 43, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] criticized Hegel's idealist philosophy in several of his works, particularly his claim to a comprehensive system that could explain the whole of reality. Where Hegel argues that an ultimate understanding of the logical structure of the world is an understanding of the logical structure of [[God]]'s mind, Kierkegaard asserts that for God reality can be a system but it cannot be so for any human individual because both reality and humans are incomplete and all philosophical systems imply completeness. A [[logical system]] is possible but an existential system is not. "What is rational is actual; and what is actual is rational".&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'' (1821)&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel's absolute idealism blurs the distinction between existence and thought: our mortal nature places limits on our understanding of reality;

&lt;blockquote&gt;So-called systems have often been characterized and challenged in the assertion that they abrogate the distinction between good and evil, and destroy freedom. Perhaps one would express oneself quite as definitely, if one said that every such system fantastically dissipates the concept existence. ... Being an individual man is a thing that has been abolished, and every speculative philosopher confuses himself with humanity at large; whereby he becomes something infinitely great, and at the same time nothing at all.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'' (1846)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A major concern of Hegel's ''Phenomenology of Spirit'' (1807) and of the philosophy of Spirit that he lays out in his ''Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences'' (1817–1830) is the interrelation between individual humans, which he conceives in terms of "mutual recognition." However, what Climacus means by the aforementioned statement, is that Hegel, in the ''Philosophy of Right'', believed the best solution was to surrender one's individuality to the customs of the State, identifying right and wrong in view of the prevailing bourgeois morality. Individual human will ought, at the State's highest level of development, to properly coincide with the will of the State. Climacus rejects Hegel's suppression of individuality by pointing out it is impossible to create a valid set of rules or system in any society which can adequately describe existence for any one individual. Submitting one's will to the State denies personal freedom, choice, and responsibility.

In addition, Hegel does believe we can know the structure of God's mind, or ultimate reality. Hegel agrees with Kierkegaard that both reality and humans are incomplete, inasmuch as we are in time, and reality develops through time. But the relation between time and eternity is outside time and this is the "logical structure" that Hegel thinks we can know. Kierkegaard disputes this assertion, because it eliminates the clear distinction between [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]]. Existence and thought are not identical and one cannot possibly think existence. Thought is always a form of abstraction, and thus not only is pure existence impossible to think, but all forms in existence are unthinkable; thought depends on language, which merely abstracts from experience, thus separating us from lived experience and the living essence of all beings. In addition, because we are finite beings, we cannot possibly know or understand anything that is universal or infinite such as God, so we cannot know God exists, since that which transcends time simultaneously transcends human understanding.

Bradley saw reality as a [[monism|monistic]] whole apprehended through "feeling", a state in which there is no distinction between the perception and the thing perceived. Like Berkeley, Bradley thought that nothing can be known to exist unless it is known by a mind.

{{Quotation|We perceive, on reflection, that to be real, or even barely to exist, must be to fall within sentience ... . Find any piece of existence, take up anything that any one could possibly call a fact, or could in any sense assert to have being, and then judge if it does not consist in sentient experience. Try to discover any sense in which you can still continue to speak of it, when all perception and feeling have been removed; or point out any fragment of its matter, any aspect of its being, which is not derived from and is not still relative to this source. When the experiment is made strictly, I can myself conceive of nothing else than the experienced.|F.H. Bradley|''Appearance and Reality''|Chapter 14}}

Bradley was the apparent target of [[G. E. Moore]]'s radical rejection of idealism. Moore claimed that Bradley did not understand the statement that something is real. We know for certain, through common sense and prephilosophical beliefs, that some things are real, whether they are objects of thought or not, according to Moore. The 1903 article ''The Refutation of Idealism'' is one of the first demonstrations of Moore's commitment to analysis. He examines each of the three terms in the Berkeleian aphorism ''esse est percipi'', "to be is to be perceived", finding that it must mean that the object and the subject are ''necessarily'' connected so that "yellow" and "the sensation of yellow" are identical - "to be yellow" is "to be experienced as yellow". But it also seems there is a difference between "yellow" and "the sensation of yellow" and "that ''esse'' is held to be ''percipi'', solely because what is experienced is held to be identical with the experience of it". Though far from a complete refutation, this was the first strong statement by analytic philosophy against its idealist predecessors, or at any rate against the type of idealism represented by Berkeley.

===Actual idealism===
[[Actual idealism]] is a form of idealism developed by [[Giovanni Gentile]] that grew into a "grounded" idealism contrasting Kant and Hegel. The idea is a version of Occam's razor; the simpler explanations are always correct. Actual idealism is the idea that reality is the ongoing act of thinking, or in Italian "pensiero pensante".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peters, R. |year=2006 |title=On Presence: "Actes De Presence": Presence in Fascist Political Culture |journal=History &amp; Theory |volume=45 |number=3 |pages=362–374 |url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/search/basic?sid=138f85e9-3bd6-470d-93cbc8aa68e8f20e%40sessionmgr4009&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any action done by humans is classified as human thought because the action was done due to predisposed thought. He further believes that thoughts are the only concept that truly exist since reality is defined through the act of thinking. This idea was derived from Gentile's paper, "The Theory of Mind As Pure Act".&lt;ref name="rightscholarship.wordpress.com"&gt;Right Thinkers #7: Giovanni Gentile (1875-1944). (2014, July 1). Retrieved February 12, 2017, from Right Scholarship https://rightscholarship.wordpress.com/tag/idealism/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since thoughts are actions, any conjectured idea can be enacted. This idea not only affects the individual's life, but everyone around them, which in turn affects the state since the people are the state.&lt;ref name="papermasters.com"&gt;Custom Research Papers on Actual Idealism. (n.d.). Retrieved February 11, 2017, from https://www.papermasters.com/actual-idealism.html&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, thoughts of each person are subsumed within the state. The state is a composition of many minds that come together to change the country for better or worse.

Gentile theorizes that thoughts can only be conjectured within the bounds of known reality; abstract thinking does not exist.&lt;ref name="rightscholarship.wordpress.com"/&gt; Thoughts cannot be formed outside our known reality because we are the reality that halt ourselves from thinking externally. With accordance to "The Act of Thought of Pure Thought", our actions comprise our thoughts, our thoughts create perception, perceptions define reality, thus we think within our created reality.

The present act of thought is reality but the past is not reality; it is history. The reason being, past can be rewritten through present knowledge and perspective of the event. The reality that is currently constructed can be completely changed through language (e.g. bias (omission, source, tone)).&lt;ref name="papermasters.com"/&gt; The unreliability of the recorded realty can skew the original concept and make the past remark unreliable. 
Actual idealism is regarded as a liberal and tolerant doctrine since it acknowledges that every being picturizes reality, in which their ideas remained hatched, differently. Even though, reality is a figment of thought.

Even though core concept of the theory is famous for its simplification, its application is regarded as extremely ambiguous. Over the years, philosophers have interpreted it numerously different ways:&lt;ref&gt;Peters, R. (2006). On Presence: "Actes De Presence": Presence in Fascist Political Culture. History &amp; Theory, 45(3), 362-374. Retrieved from http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/search/basic?sid=138f85e9-3bd6-470d-93cbc8aa68e8f20e%40sessionmgr4009&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4104&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes took it as metaphysics of the thinking act; Betti as a form of hermeneutics; Harris as a metaphysics of democracy; Fogu as a modernist philosophy of history.

Giovanni Gentile was a key supporter of fascism, regarded by many as the "philosopher of fascism". Gentile's philosophy was the key to understating fascism as it was believed by many who supported and loved it. They believed, if priori synthesis of subject and object is true, there is no difference between the individuals in society; they're all one. Which means that they have equal right, roles, and jobs. In fascist state, submission is given to one leader because individuals act as one body. In Gentile's view, far more can be accomplished when individuals are under a corporate body than a collection of autonomous individual.&lt;ref name="papermasters.com"/&gt;

===Pluralistic idealism&lt;!--'Plurastic idealism' redirects here--&gt;===
'''Pluralistic idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; such as that of [[Gottfried Leibniz]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Blamauer (ed.), ''The Mental as Fundamental: New Perspectives on Panpsychism'', Walter de Gruyter, 2013, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eskimo.com/~msharlow/idealism.htm "About Idealism"]&lt;/ref&gt; takes the view that there are many individual minds that together underlie the existence of the observed world and make possible the existence of the physical universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eskimo.com/~msharlow/idealism.htm|title=Metaphysical Idealism|website=www.eskimo.com|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike absolute idealism, pluralistic idealism does not assume the existence of a single ultimate mental reality or "Absolute". Leibniz' form of idealism, known as [[Panpsychism]], views "monads" as the true atoms of the universe and as entities having perception. The monads are "substantial forms of being, "elemental, individual, subject to their own laws, non-interacting, each reflecting the entire universe. Monads are centers of force, which is [[Substance theory|substance]] while space, matter and motion are phenomenal and their form and existence is dependent on the simple and immaterial monads. There is a [[pre-established harmony]] by [[God]], the central monad, between the world in the minds of the [[Monadology|monad]]s and the external world of objects. Leibniz's cosmology embraced traditional Christian [[theism]]. The English psychologist and philosopher [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]] inspired by Leibniz had also defended a form of pluralistic idealism.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Cambridge Modern History: The era of violence, 1898-1945, edited by David Thomson'' University Press, 1960, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ward the universe is composed of "psychic monads" of different levels, interacting for mutual self-betterment.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Joseph Tallon The concept of self in British and American idealism 1939, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personalism]] is the view that the minds that underlie reality are the minds of persons. [[Borden Parker Bowne]], a philosopher at Boston University, a founder and popularizer of personal idealism, presented it as a substantive reality of persons, the only reality, as known directly in self-consciousness. Reality is a society of interacting persons dependent on the Supreme Person of God. Other proponents include [[George Holmes Howison]]&lt;ref&gt;The Limits Of Evolution; And Other Essays Illustrating The Metaphysical Theory Of Personal Idealism By George Holmes Howison&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[J. M. E. McTaggart]].&lt;ref&gt;See the book Idealistic Argument in Recent British and American Philosophy By Gustavus W Cunningham page 202 "Ontologically i am an idealist, since i believe that all that exists is spiritual. I am also, in one sense of the term, a Personal Idealist."&lt;/ref&gt;

Howison's personal idealism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howison.us/george_holmes_howison.htm |title=George Holmes Howison |publisher=Howison.us |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707190718/http://www.howison.us/george_holmes_howison.htm |archivedate=7 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was also called "California Personalism" by others to distinguish it from the "Boston Personalism" which was of Bowne. Howison maintained that both impersonal, monistic idealism and materialism run contrary to the experience of moral freedom. To deny freedom to pursue truth, beauty, and "benignant love" is to undermine every profound human venture, including science, morality, and philosophy. Personalistic idealists Borden Parker Bowne and [[Edgar S. Brightman]] and realistic personal theist [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] address a core issue, namely that of dependence upon an infinite personal God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/howison-george-holmes-18341916-eoph/ |title=Research &amp; Articles on Howison, George Holmes (1834–1916) by |publisher=BookRags.com |date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howison, in his book ''The Limits of Evolution and Other Essays Illustrating the Metaphysical Theory of Personal Idealism'', created a democratic notion of personal idealism that extended all the way to God, who was no more the ultimate monarch but the ultimate democrat in eternal relation to other eternal persons. J. M. E. McTaggart's idealist atheism and [[Thomas Davidson (philosopher)|Thomas Davidson]]'s Apeirionism resemble Howisons personal idealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/209478|title=George Holmes Howison: &amp;quot;The City of God&amp;quot; and Personal Idealism|first=James.|last=McLachlan|publisher=|volume=20|issue=3|pages=224–242|doi=10.1353/jsp.2007.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. M. E. McTaggart]] of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] argued that minds alone exist and only relate to each other through love. [[Space]], [[time]] and material objects are unreal. In ''[[The Unreality of Time]]'' he argued that time is an illusion because it is impossible to produce a coherent account of a sequence of events. ''The Nature of Existence'' (1927) contained his arguments that space, time, and matter cannot possibly be real. In his ''Studies in Hegelian Cosmology'' (Cambridge, 1901, p196) he declared that metaphysics are not relevant to social and political action. McTaggart "thought that Hegel was wrong in supposing that metaphysics could show that the state is more than a means to the good of the individuals who compose it".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', vol. 3, "Idealism," New York, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; For McTaggart "philosophy can give us very little, if any, guidance in action... Why should a Hegelian citizen be surprised that his belief as to the organic nature of the Absolute does not help him in deciding how to vote? Would a Hegelian engineer be reasonable in expecting that his belief that all matter is spirit should help him in planning a bridge?&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in Hegelian Cosmology'' ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Davidson taught a philosophy called "[[apeirotheism]]", a "form of pluralistic idealism...coupled with a stern ethical rigorism"&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Bakewell, "Thomas Davidson," Dictionary of American Biography, gen. ed. Dumas Malone (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1932), 96.&lt;/ref&gt; which he defined as "a theory of Gods infinite in number." The theory was indebted to [[Aristotle]]'s pluralism and his concepts of Soul, the rational, living aspect of a living substance which cannot exist apart from the body because it is not a substance but an essence, and ''[[nous]]'', rational thought, reflection and understanding. Although a perennial source of controversy, Aristotle arguably views the latter as both eternal and immaterial in nature, as exemplified in his theology of [[unmoved movers]].&lt;ref name="Gerson"&gt;{{cite book |first=Lloyd P. |last=Gerson |title=The Unity of Intellect in Aristotle's "De Anima" |journal=Phronesis |volume=49 |number=4 |year=2004 |pages=348–373 |url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/lpgerson/The_Unity_Of_Intellect_In_Aristotles_De_Anima.pdf |jstor=4182761 |quote=Desperately difficult texts inevitably elicit desperate hermeneutical measures. Aristotle's ''De Anima,'' book three, chapter five, is evidently one such text. At least since the time of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], scholars have felt compelled to draw some remarkable conclusions regarding Aristotle's brief remarks in this passage regarding intellect. One such claim is that in chapter five, Aristotle introduces a second intellect, the so-called 'agent intellect', an intellect distinct from the 'passive intellect', the supposed focus of discussion up until this passage. This view is a direct descendent of the view of Alexander himself, who identified the agent intellect with the divine intellect. Even the staunchest defender of such a view is typically at a loss to give a plausible explanation of why the divine intellect pops into and then out of the picture in the intense and closely argued discussion of the human intellect that goes from chapter four through to the end of chapter seven.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying Aristotle's God with rational thought, Davidson argued, contrary to Aristotle, that just as the soul cannot exist apart from the body, God cannot exist apart from the world.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Journal, 1884-1898 (Thomas Davidson Collection, Manuscript Group #169, Sterling Memorial Library, Yale University). Quoted in DeArmey, "Thomas Davidson's Apeirotheism," 692&lt;/ref&gt;

Idealist notions took a strong hold among physicists of the early 20th century confronted with the paradoxes of [[quantum physics]] and the [[theory of relativity]]. In ''[[The Grammar of Science]]'', Preface to the 2nd Edition, 1900, [[Karl Pearson]] wrote, "There are many signs that a sound idealism is surely replacing, as a basis for natural philosophy, the crude [[materialism]] of the older physicists." This book influenced [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s regard for the importance of the observer in scientific measurements{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. In § 5 of that book, Pearson asserted that "...science is in reality a classification and analysis of the contents of the mind...." Also, "...the field of science is much more [[consciousness]] than an external world."

Sir [[Arthur Eddington]], a British astrophysicist of the early 20th century, wrote in his book ''The Nature of the Physical World'' that "The stuff of the world is mind-stuff": &lt;blockquote&gt;The mind-stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual conscious minds.... The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it.... It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed, has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness.... Consciousness is not sharply defined, but fades into subconsciousness; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature.... It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character. But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience, and all else is remote inference."&lt;ref&gt;A.S. Eddington, ''The Nature of the Physical World'', page 276-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:James Hopwood Jeans.jpg|thumb|240px|The 20th-century British scientist Sir [[James Hopwood Jeans|James Jeans]] wrote that "the Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine"]]
[[Ian Barbour]] in his book ''Issues in Science and Religion'' (1966), p. 133, cites Arthur Eddington's ''The Nature of the Physical World'' (1928) for a text that argues The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principles provides a scientific basis for "the defense of the idea of human freedom" and his ''Science and the Unseen World'' (1929) for support of philosophical idealism "the thesis that reality is basically mental".

[[Sir James Jeans]] wrote: "The stream of knowledge is heading towards a non-mechanical reality; the Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter... we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter."&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Jeans, ''The mysterious universe'', page 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeans, in an interview published in [[The Observer]] (London), when asked the question: "Do you believe that life on this planet is the result of some sort of accident, or do you believe that it is a part of some great scheme?" replied: &lt;blockquote&gt;I incline to the idealistic theory that consciousness is fundamental, and that the material universe is derivative from consciousness, not consciousness from the material universe... In general the universe seems to me to be nearer to a great thought than to a great machine. It may well be, it seems to me, that each individual consciousness ought to be compared to a brain-cell in a universal mind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Addressing the [[British Association]] in 1934, Jeans said: &lt;blockquote&gt;What remains is in any case very different from the full-blooded matter and the forbidding [[materialism]] of the Victorian scientist. His objective and material universe is proved to consist of little more than constructs of our own minds. To this extent, then, modern physics has moved in the direction of philosophic idealism. Mind and matter, if not proved to be of similar nature, are at least found to be ingredients of one single system. There is no longer room for the kind of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] which has haunted philosophy since the days of [[Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Jeans addressing the [[British Association]] in 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''The Universe Around Us'', Jeans writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Finite picture whose dimensions are a certain amount of space and a certain amount of time; the protons and electrons are the streaks of paint which define the picture against its space-time background. Traveling as far back in time as we can, brings us not to the creation of the picture, but to its edge; the creation of the picture lies as much outside the picture as the artist is outside his canvas. On this view, discussing the creation of the universe in terms of time and space is like trying to discover the artist and the action of painting, by going to the edge of the canvas. This brings us very near to those philosophical systems which regard the universe as a thought in the mind of its Creator, thereby reducing all discussion of material creation to futility.&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Jeans ''The Universe Around Us'' page 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The chemist [[Ernest Lester Smith]] wrote a book ''Intelligence Came First'' (1975) in which he claimed that consciousness is a fact of nature and that the cosmos is grounded in and pervaded by mind and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Lester Smith''Intelligence Came First'' Quest Books, 1990 {{ISBN|0-8356-0657-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard d'Espagnat]], a French theoretical physicist best known for his work on the nature of reality, wrote a paper titled ''The Quantum Theory and Reality''. According to the paper:  &lt;blockquote&gt;The doctrine that the world is made up of objects whose existence is independent of human consciousness turns out to be in conflict with quantum mechanics and with facts established by experiment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/media/pdf/197911_0158.pdf "The Quantum Theory and Reality"] (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article entitled "Quantum Weirdness: What We Call 'Reality' is Just a State of Mind",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2009/mar/17/templeton-quantum-entanglement "Quantum weirdness: What We Call 'Reality' is Just a State of Mind"] (20 March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; d'Espagnat wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;What quantum mechanics tells us, I believe, is surprising to say the least. It tells us that the basic components of objects – the particles, electrons, quarks etc. – cannot be thought of as 'self-existent'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He further writes that his research in [[quantum physics]] has led him to conclude that an "ultimate reality" exists, which is not embedded in space or time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=d'Espagnat|first=Bernard|title=Quantum weirdness: What We Call 'Reality' is Just a State of Mind|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2009/mar/17/templeton-quantum-entanglement|newspaper=Guardian|date=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In computer science, Identity Intelligence is the application, within the [[Identity Management]] field, of analytical techniques typical of business intelligence and other related tools for analysis and control.

== Terminology ==
The term "Identity Intelligence" has been diffused throughout the course of 2010, also thanks to its adoption by [[Gartner]], and refers mainly to the following set of capabilities:
* the presence, within an organization, of a '''full repository of user accounts''', able to effectively collect every information characterizing the users and their access rights. The difference is substantial if compared to the "standard" repositories used by the [[Identity Management]] solutions, typically simpler and less suited for complex analysis.
* the '''ability to relate information''' from different target and authoritative sources, in order to correctly and efficiently populate the repository. In complex environments, data about users and user accounts are collected from dozens or hundreds of different sources, using different standards, different structures and different technologies. In order to allow quick, detailed and complete analysis, it is essential to have a tool that can collect, relate and homogenize all this data.
* The ability to build complex analysis, based on the principles of business intelligence, providing valuable information in relation with:
** the state of the users within the organization,
** the quality of the user management processes.
** an overview of user identities and their access within the enterprise.
** an ability to relate identity information with various entities within the organization such as assets, resources etc.

:At the same time, monitoring and reporting systems which operate on a complete repository, offer security features and advanced control.

== Why do you need "Intelligence" before "Management"? ==
The need for Identity Intelligence tools and models comes with the awareness, developed in recent years, that an [[Identity Management]] system used for the sole purpose of automating the user account management, exploits its possibilities only in part. In recent years the '[[Identity Management]] solutions are increasingly seen as tools addressed to security '''governance''', tools used increase security, tools used to meet the '''compliance''' requirements that organizations must meet in order to satisfy regulatory constraints, to obtain certifications and to satisfy internal and external audit.
&lt;br /&gt;
The assumption to the adoption of an Identity Intelligence solution is that "''you can not manage what you can not measure''". In order to properly manage user accounts and identities, you must first be able to get to know them in detail.
&lt;br /&gt;
For these reasons, between 2010 and 2011 the evolution trend shows how companies adopt mechanisms and instruments of Identity Intelligence from the early stages of the life cycle of their Identity Management systems. The most innovative approach that provides the Identity Intelligence is introduced in the company even before the '[[Identity Management]], so that it can serve as a support in the definition of requirements and the model of [[Identity Management]] to be performed. This approach, while introducing the cost of a preliminary stage, it increases the chances of success of a project of [[Identity Management]], allows to have information about the status of the User Management useful to ascertain the real need for such a project and gives you a snapshot of the situation to the "time''0'', "to which you can always see in the future to measure the success or failure of projects.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2014}}
The doctrine or theory of '''immanence''' holds that the [[divine]] encompasses or is manifested in the material world. It is held by some [[philosophical]] and [[metaphysical]] theories of [[divine presence]]. Immanence is usually applied in [[monotheism|monotheistic]], [[Pantheism|pantheistic]], [[Pandeism|pandeistic]], or [[Panentheism|panentheistic]] faiths to suggest that the spiritual world permeates the [[Wikt:mundane|mundane]]. It is often contrasted with theories of [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]], in which the divine is seen to be outside the material world.

Major faiths commonly devote significant philosophical efforts to explaining the relationship between immanence and transcendence but do so in different ways, such as:
* casting immanence as a characteristic of a transcendent God (common in [[Abrahamic religion]]s), 
* subsuming immanent [[personal god]]s in a greater transcendent being (such as with [[Brahman]] in [[Hinduism]]), or
* approaching the question of transcendence as something which can only be answered through an appraisal of immanence.

== Ancient Greek philosophy ==
Another meaning of immanence is the quality of being contained within, or remaining within the boundaries of a person, of the world, or of the mind. This meaning is more common within Christian and other monotheist theology, in which the one God is considered to transcend his creation.

[[Pythagoreanism]] says that the ''[[nous]]'' is an intelligent principle of the world acting with a specific [[intention]]. This is the divine reason regarded in [[Neoplatonism]] as the first [[Emanationism|emanation]] of the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofiatopia.org/equiaeon/divine.htm Sofiatopia.org], Divine Reason. Noetic (from Greek ''nous'') is usually translated as "mind", "understanding", "intellect", or "reason".&lt;/ref&gt; From the ''nous'' emerges the [[Anima mundi|world soul]], which gives rise to the manifest realm. Pythagoreanism goes on to say the [[Deity|Godhead]] is the Father, Mother, and Son (Zeus). In the mind of Zeus, the ''ideas'' are distinctly articulated and become the [[Logos]] by which he creates the world. These ideas become active in the Mind (''nous'') of Zeus. With him is the Power and from him is the ''nous''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021110092117/http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/ETP/III.html#creationdemiurge Utk.edu], Demiurge Creation&lt;/ref&gt; This theology further explains that Zeus is called [[Demiurge]] (''Dêmiourgos'', Creator), Maker (''Poiêtês''), and Craftsman (''Technitês'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021110092117/http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/ETP/III.html#craftsman Utk.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The nous of the demiurge proceeds outward into manifestation becoming living ideas. They give rise to a lineage of mortal human souls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020817035344/http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/ETP/V.html#basicprinciples Utk.edu], Basic Principles&lt;/ref&gt; The components of the soul are&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021110092117/http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/ETP/III.html#creationothers Utk.edu], Components of the Soul&lt;/ref&gt; 1) the higher soul, seat of the intuitive mind (''divine nous''); 2) the rational soul (''logistiko''n) (seat of discursive reason / ''dianoia''); 3) the nonrational soul (''alogia''), responsible for the senses, appetites, and motion. Zeus thinks the articulated ideas (Logos). The ''idea of ideas'' (''Eidos - Eidôn''), provides a model of the Paradigm of the Universe, which the Demiurge contemplates in his articulation of the ''ideas'' and his creation of the world according to the Logos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021110092117/http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/ETP/III.html#selfcontemplating Utk.edu], Self Contemplating Nous&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buddhism ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
[[Tantra|Tantric]] [[Buddhism]] and [[Dzogchen]] posit a non-dual basis for both experience and reality that could be considered an exposition of a philosophy of immanence that has a history on the subcontinent of India from early CE to the present. A paradoxical  [[nondualism|non-dual]] awareness or ''[[rigpa]]'' ([[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] — ''vidya'' in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]) — is said to be the 'self perfected state' of all beings. Scholarly works differentiate these traditions from [[monism]]. The non-dual is said to be not immanent and not transcendent, not neither, nor both. One classical exposition is the [[Madhyamaka]] refutation of extremes that the philosopher-adept [[Nagarjuna]] propounded.

Exponents of this non-dual tradition emphasize the importance of a direct experience of non-duality through both meditative practice and philosophical investigation. In one version, one maintains awareness as thoughts arise and dissolve within the 'field' of [[mind]], one does not accept or reject them, rather one lets the mind wander as it will until a subtle sense of immanence dawns. Vipassana or insight is the integration of one's 'presence of awareness' with that which arises in mind. Non-duality or rigpa is said to be the recognition that both the quiet, calm abiding state as found in samatha and the movement or arising of phenomena as found in vipassana are not separate. In this way it could be stated that Dzogchen is a method for the recognition of a 'pure immanence' analogous to what [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]] theorized about.

==Christianity==

=== Catholicism and Eastern Christianity ===
{{Attributes of God}}
According to Christian theology, the transcendent [[God]], who cannot be approached or seen in essence or being, becomes immanent primarily in the [[God-man (Christianity)|God-man]] [[Jesus]] the [[Christ]], who is the [[incarnate]] Second Person of the [[Trinity]]. In [[Byzantine Rite]] theology the immanence of God is expressed as the [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostases]] or energies of God, who in his essence is incomprehensible and transcendent. In Catholic theology, Christ and the Holy Spirit immanently reveal themselves; God the Father only reveals himself immanently vicariously through the Son and Spirit, and the Divine Nature, the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]] is wholly transcendent and unable to be comprehended.

This is expressed in [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]]'s letter to the Philippians, where he writes:

:who, although He  existed in the  form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,
:but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and  being made in the likeness of men.
: Being found in appearance as a man,  He humbled Himself by becoming  obedient to the point of death, even  death on a cross.&lt;ref&gt;Philippians 2:6–8, (NASB)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holy Spirit is also expressed as an immanence of God.
:and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&amp;chapter=3&amp;verse=22&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse Luke 3:22], [[BibleGateway.com]], ([[New International Version]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The immanence of the triune God is celebrated in the Catholic Church and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Churches]] during the liturgical calendar feast as the [[Theophany]] of God (see [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of Theophany]]).

[[Pope Pius X]] wrote at length about philosophical-theological controversies over immanence in his encyclical ''[[Pascendi dominici gregis]]''.

In the theology of [[Karl Rahner]], it is said that "the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity." That is to say, God communicates Himself to humanity ("economic" Trinity) as He really is in the divine Life ("immanent" Trinity).

== Mormonism ==
According to [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint]] theology, all of material creation is filled with immanence, known as the [[Light of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|light of Christ]]. It is also responsible for the intuitive conscience born into man. The Light of Christ is the source of intellectual and spiritual enlightenment, and is the means by which God is in and through all things.&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine and Covenants Section 88:6-13. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060716025030/http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/88 Lds.org]&lt;/ref&gt; LDS scriptures identify the divine Light with the mind of God, the source of all truth and conveyor of the characteristics of the divine nature through God’s goodness. The experienced brilliance of God reflects the “fullness” of this spirit within God’s being.&lt;ref&gt;Parley P. Pratt, Key to the Science of Theology (Salt Lake City: George Q. Cannon &amp; Sons, 1891) particularly chap. V. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_1MUx7kjctMC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Parley+P.+Pratt+Key+to+the+Science+of+Theology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OOuUEqvzV0&amp;sig=Uou9dsUg4g1VHmNYFo8HLivDlPQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FgWsSt-cKY3EsQObv8SHBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google Books Search]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, mankind can incorporate this spiritual light or divine mind and thus become one with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|93|6|18}}; {{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|50|24}}; John 17:22; cf. John 1:16 and 2 Corinthians 3:18&lt;/ref&gt; This immanent spirit of light bridges the scientific and spiritual conceptualizations of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;B.H. Roberts "Divine Immanence", The Seventy's Course in Theology, Fifth year, pp. 1-34.John A. Widstoe, Joseph Smith as Scientist (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1968) [originally 1908] pp. 136-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continental philosophy ==
[[Giordano Bruno]]'s, [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s and, it may be argued, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s philosophies were philosophies of immanence versus philosophies of transcendence such as [[Thomism]] or [[Aristotle|Aristotelian tradition]].  Kant's "transcendental" critique can be contrasted to Hegel's "immanent dialectics."&lt;ref&gt;For further information on Hegel's immanent dialectics, see J. T. Fraser, F. C. Haber, G. H. Müller (eds.), ''The Study of Time: Proceedings of the First Conference of the International Society for the Study of Time Oberwolfach (Black Forest) — West Germany, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012, p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gilles Deleuze]] qualified [[Spinoza]] as the "prince of philosophers" for his theory of immanence, which Spinoza resumed by "''[[Deus sive Natura]]''" ("God or Nature"). Such a theory considers that there is no [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] principle or external cause to the world, and that the process of life production is contained in life itself.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Antonio Negri]], ''The Savage Anomaly: The Power of Spinoza's Metaphysics and Politics'' (transl. 1991, Minnesota University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; When compounded with [[Idealism]], the immanence theory qualifies itself away from "the world" to there being no external cause to one's mind.

[[Giovanni Gentile]]'s [[actual idealism]], sometimes called "philosophy of immanence" and the metaphysics of the "I", "affirms the organic synthesis of dialectical opposites that are immanent within actual or present awareness".&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;M. E. Moss, ''Mussolini's Fascist Philosopher: Giovanni Gentile Reconsidered'', Peter Lang, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; His so-called method of immanence "attempted to avoid: (1) the postulate of an independently existing world or a Kantian ''Ding-an-sich'' ([[thing-in-itself]]), and (2) the tendency of neo-Hegelian philosophy to lose the particular self in an Absolute that amounts to a kind of mystical reality without distinctions."&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

Political theorist [[Carl Schmitt]] used the term in his book ''[[Politische Theologie]]'' (1922), meaning a power within some thought, which makes it obvious for the people to accept it, without needing to claim being justified.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Schmitt: ''Political Theology'', 1922, found in: ''Political Theology: Four Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty'', University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The immanence of some political system or a part of it comes from the reigning contemporary definer of ''Weltanschauung'', namely religion (or any similar system of beliefs, such as rationalistic or relativistic world-view). The [[Nazi]]s took advantage of this theory creating, or resurrecting, basically religious [[mythology]] of race, its heroes, and its destiny to motivate people and to make their reign unquestionable, which it became.&lt;ref&gt;Lacoue-Labarthe, Philippe &amp; Nancy, Jean-Luc: ''The Nazi Myth'' (1990), ''Critical Inquiry'' 16:2 (winter), 291-312: the University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The French 20th-century philosopher Gilles Deleuze used the term immanence to refer to his "[[empiricist]] philosophy", which was obliged to create action and results rather than establish transcendents. His final text was titled ''Immanence: a life...'' and spoke of a [[plane of immanence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egs.edu/library/gilles-deleuze/biography/ Gilles Deleuze.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611135900/http://www.egs.edu/library/gilles-deleuze/biography |date=2010-06-11 }} Profile in Philosophical Library. [[European Graduate School]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the Russian Formalist film theorists perceived immanence as a specific method of discussing the limits of ability for a technological object. Specifically, this is the scope of potential uses of an object outside of the limits prescribed by culture or convention, and is instead simply the empirical spectrum of function for a technological artifact.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stam, ''Film Theory'', 2006, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judaism ==
{{Main|Tzimtzum}}
Traditional Jewish religious thought can be divided into ''[[Nigleh]]'' ("Revealed") and ''[[Nistar]]'' ("Hidden") dimensions. Hebrew [[Scripture]] is, in the [[Kabbalistic]] tradition, explained using the four level [[exegesis]] method of ''[[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|Pardes]]''. In this system, the first three approaches, Simple, Hinted and Homiletical interpretations, characterise the revealed aspects. The fourth approach, the Secret meaning, characterises a hidden aspect. Among the classic texts of Jewish tradition, some Jewish Bible commentators, the ''[[Midrash]]'', the ''[[Talmud]]'', and mainstream [[Jewish philosophy]] use revealed approaches. Other Bible commentators, the [[Kabbalah]], and [[Hasidic philosophy]], use hidden approaches. Both dimensions are seen by adherents as united and complementary. In this way, ideas in Jewish thought are given a variety of ascending meanings. Explanations of a concept in ''Nigleh'', are given inherent, inner, mystical contexts from ''Nistar''.

Descriptions of Divine immanence can be seen in ''Nigleh'', from the Bible to Rabbinic Judaism. In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], God makes a personal covenant with the forefathers [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]]. Daily Jewish prayers refer to this inherited closeness and personal relationship with the Divine, for their descendants, as "the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob". To [[Moses]], God reveals his [[Tetragrammaton]] name, that more fully captures Divine descriptions of [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]]. Each of the Biblical names for God, describe different Divine manifestations. The most important prayer in Judaism, that forms part of the Scriptural narrative to Moses, says "Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One." This declaration combines different Divine names, and themes of immanence{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} and transcendence. Perhaps the most personal example of a Jewish prayer that combines both themes is the invocation repeatedly voiced during the time in the Jewish calendar devoted to ''[[Repentance in Judaism|Teshuva]]'' (Return, often inaccurately translated as Repentance), ''Avinu Malkeinu'' ("Our Father, Our King"). Much of the later Hebrew Biblical narrative recounts the reciprocal relationship and national drama of the unfolding of themes of immanence and transcendence. Kabbalistic, or Hasidic Jewish thought and philosophy describe and articulate these interconnected aspects of the Divine-human relationship.

Jewish Mysticism gives explanations of greater depth and spirituality, to the interconnected aspects of God's immanence and transcendence. The main expression of mysticism, the Kabbalah, began to be taught in 12th Century Europe, and reached a new systemisation in 16th Century Israel. The Kabbalah gives the full, subtle, traditional system of Jewish [[metaphysics]]. In the Medieval Kabbalah, new doctrines described the 10 ''[[Sephirot]]'' (Divine emanations) through which the Infinite, unknowable Divine essence reveals, emanates, and continuously creates existence. The Kabbalists identified the final, feminine ''Sefirah'' with the earlier, traditional Jewish concept of the ''[[Shekhinah]]'' (immanent Divine Presence). This gave great spirituality to earlier ideas in Jewish thought, such as the theological explanations of suffering ([[theodicy]]). In this example, the Kabbalists described the ''Shekhinah'' accompanying the children of Israel in their exile, being exiled alongside them, and yearning for Her redemption. Such a concept derives from the Kabbalistic theology that the physical World, and also the Upper spiritual Worlds, are continuously recreated from nothing by the ''Shefa'' (flow) of Divine will, which emanates through the ''Sefirot''. As a result, within all creations are Divine sparks of vitality that sustain them. Medieval ''Kabbalah'' describes two forms of Divine emanation, a "light that fills all worlds", representing this immanent Divine creative power, and a "light that surrounds all worlds", representing transcendent expressions of Divinity.

The new doctrines of [[Isaac Luria]] in the 16th Century completed the Kabbalistic system of explanation. Lurianic Kabbalah describes the process of ''[[Tzimtzum]]'' (צמצום meaning "Contraction" or "Constriction") in the Kabbalistic theory of creation, where God "contracted" his infinite essence in order to allow for a "conceptual space" in which a finite, independent world could exist. This has received different later interpretations in Jewish mysticism, from the literal to the metaphorical. In this process, creation unfolds within the Divine reality. Luria offered a daring cosmic theology that explained the reasons for the ''Tzimtzum'', the primordial catastrophe of ''[[Shevirat Hakelim]]'' (the "Breaking of the Vessels" of the ''Sefirot'' in the first existence), and the messianic ''[[Tikkun olam|Tikkun]]'' ("Fixing") of this by every individual through their sanctification of physicality. The concept of ''Tzimtzum'' contains a built-in [[paradox]], as it requires that God be simultaneously transcendent and immanent:

* On the one hand, if the Infinite did not "restrict itself", then nothing could exist. There would be no limits, as the infinite essence of God, and also His primordial infinite light (Kabbalistic sources discuss God being able to reign alone, a revealed "light" of the ''Sefirah'' of Kingship, "before" creation) would comprise all reality. Any existence would be nullified into the Divine Infinity. Therefore, we could not have the variety of limited, finite things that comprise the creations in the Universe that we inhabit. (The number of such creations could still be potentially limitless, if the physical [[Universe]], or [[Multiverse]] had no end). Because each limited thing results from a restriction of God's completeness, God Himself must transcend (exist beyond) these various limited things. This idea can be interpreted in various ways. In its ultimate articulation, by the Hasidic leader [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]], in the intellectual Hasidic method of [[Chabad]], the ''Tzimtzum'' is only metaphorical, an illusion from the perspective of man. Creation is [[panentheism|panentheistic]] (taking place fully "within God"), and [[acosmic]] (Illusionary) from the Divine perspective. God Himself, and even His light, is unrestricted by ''Tzimtzum'', from God's perspective. The ''Tzimtzum'' is merely the hiding of this unchanged reality from Creation. Shneur Zalman distinguishes between the "Upper Level Unity" of God's existence from the Divine perspective, with the "Lower Level Unity" of God's existence as creation perceives Him. Because God can be above logic, both perspectives of this paradox are true, from their alternative views. The dimension of the ''Tzimtzum'', which implies Divine transcendence, corresponds to the Upper Level Unity. In this perspective, because God is the true, ultimate Infinity, then Creation (even if its physical and spiritual realms should extend without limit) is completely nullified into literal non-existence by the Divine. There is no change in the complete unity of God as all Reality, before or after creation. This is the ultimate level of Divine transcendence.
* On the other hand, in Lurianic ''Kabbalah'', the ''Tzimtzum'' has an immanent Divine dimension. The ''Tzimtzum'' formed a "space" (in Lurianic terminology, the ''Halal'', "Vacuum") in which to allow creation to take place. The first act of creation was the emanation of a new light (''Kav'', "Ray") into the vacated space, from the ultimate Divine reality "outside", or unaffected, by the space. The purpose of the ''Tzimtzum'' was that the vacated space allowed this new light to be suited to the needs and capacities of the new creations, without their being subsumed in the primordial Divine Infinity. Kabbalistic theology offers metaphysical explanations of how Divine and spiritual processes unfold. In earlier, mainstream Jewish philosophy, logical descriptions of creation ''ex nihilo'' (from nothing) describe the new existence of creation, compared to the preceding absence. ''Kabbalah'', however, seeks to explain how the spiritual, metaphysical processes unfold. Therefore, in the Kabbalistic system, God is the ultimate reality, so that creation only exists because it is continuously sustained by the will of God. Creation is formed from the emanated "light" of the Divine Will, as it unfolds through the later ''Sefirot''. The light that originated with the ''Kav'' later underwent further contractions that diminished it, so that this immanent expression of Divinity could itself create the various levels of Spiritual, and ultimately, Physical existence. The terms of "light" and temporal descriptions of time are metaphorical, in a language accessible to grasp. In this immanent Divine dimension, God continuously maintains the existence of, and is thus not absent from, the created universe. In Shneur Zalman's explanation, this corresponds to the conscious perception by Creation of "Lower Level Unity" of God. In this perspective, Creation is real, and not an illusion, but is utterly nullified to the immanent Divine life force that continuously sustains and recreates it. It may not perceive its complete dependence on Divinity, as in our present World, that feels its own existence as independent reality. However, this derives from the great concealments of Godliness in our present World. "The Divine life-force which brings all creatures into existence must constantly be present within them ... were this life-force to forsake any created being for even one brief moment, it would revert to a state of utter nothingness, as before the creation ...". (''[[Tanya]], Shaar Hayichud'', Chapter 2-3. Shneur Zalman of Liadi).

'''Indian CSICOP''' is a well-known [[rationalist]] group based at [[Podanur]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. Founded by [[Basava Premanand]] (1930&amp;ndash;2009). Indian CSICOP is in the forefront of the rationalist campaigns in India which attempt to expose perceived miracles and to eradicate [[superstition]]s.

Indian CSICOP is an affiliate of the US-based skeptical group [[CSICOP]] and it publishes ''Indian Skeptic'', a rationalist periodical. It is also affiliated to the [[Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations]], which is an apex body of about 65 [[rationalist]], [[atheist]] and organizations aimed at popularization of [[science]] among laypersons. It is an associate member of [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] based in [[London]].

One of the main targets of criticism by the ''Indian Skeptic'' are the miracles and magic of the [[guru]] [[Sathya Sai Baba]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Kent, ''Divinity and Diversity: a Hindu revitalization movement in Malaysia'', page 53: "The Indian Skeptic publishes letters and articles and distributes films designed to debunk particularly Sathya Sai Baba. [..] these criticisms are aimed not at the teachings as such, which are quite innocuous, but at the claims of miraculous powers." Copenhagen Nias Press, first published in 2005, {{ISBN|87-91114-40-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4984">{{Solid principles}}

In the field of [[software engineering]], the '''interface-segregation principle''' ('''ISP''') states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.&lt;ref name="ASD"&gt;
Martin, Robert (2002). Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices. Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt; ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them. Such shrunken interfaces are also called ''role interface''s.&lt;ref name="RoleInterface"&gt;[http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RoleInterface.html Role Interface]&lt;/ref&gt; ISP is intended to keep a system decoupled and thus easier to refactor, change, and redeploy.
ISP is one of the five [[SOLID (object-oriented design)|SOLID]] principles of object-oriented design, similar to the High Cohesion Principle of [[GRASP (object-oriented design)|GRASP]].&lt;ref name="CB"&gt;[http://codebetter.com/blogs/david.hayden/archive/2005/06/15/64635.aspx David Hayden, ''Interface-Segregation Principle (ISP) - Principles of Object-Oriented Class Design'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance in object-oriented design==
Within [[object-oriented design]], [[Interface (object-oriented programming)|interfaces]] provide layers of abstraction that facilitate conceptual explanation of the code and create a barrier preventing coupling to [[Dependency inversion principle|dependencies]].

According to many software experts who have signed the Manifesto for [[Software Craftsmanship]], writing well-crafted and self-explanatory software is almost as important as writing working software.&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;[http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org Manifesto of Software Craftsmanship]&lt;/ref&gt; Using interfaces to further describe the intent of the software is often a good idea.

A system may become so coupled at multiple levels that it is no longer possible to make a change in one place without necessitating many additional changes.&lt;ref name="ASD" /&gt; Using an interface or an [[abstract class]] can prevent this side effect.

==Origin==
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2013}}
The ISP was first used and formulated by [[Robert C. Martin]] while consulting for [[Xerox]]. Xerox had created a new printer system that could perform a variety of tasks such as stapling and faxing. The software for this system was created from the ground up. As the software grew, making modifications became more and more difficult so that even the smallest change would take a redeployment cycle of an hour, which made development nearly impossible.

The design problem was that a single Job class was used by almost all of the tasks. Whenever a print job or a stapling job needed to be performed, a call was made to the Job class. This resulted in a 'fat' class with multitudes of methods specific to a variety of different clients. Because of this design, a staple job would know about all the methods of the print job, even though there was no use for them.

The solution suggested by Martin utilized what is today called the Interface Segregation Principle. Applied to the Xerox software, an interface layer between the Job class and its clients was added using the [[Dependency inversion principle|Dependency Inversion Principle]]. Instead of having one large Job class, a Staple Job interface or a Print Job interface was created that would be used by the Staple or Print classes, respectively, calling methods of the Job class. Therefore, one interface was created for each job type, which was all implemented by the Job class.

==Typical violation==
A typical violation of the Interface Segregation Principle is given in Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices&lt;ref name="ASD" /&gt; in 'ATM Transaction example' and in an article also written by [[Robert C. Martin]] specifically about the ISP.&lt;ref name="ISPArticle"&gt;[https://docs.google.com/a/cleancoder.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0BwhCYaYDn8EgOTViYjJhYzMtMzYxMC00MzFjLWJjMzYtOGJiMDc5N2JkYmJi&amp;hl=en Robert C. Martin,''The Interface Segregation Principle'', C++ Report, June 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; This example discusses the User Interface for an ATM, which handles all requests such as a deposit request, or a withdrawal request, and how this interface needs to be segregated into individual and more specific interfaces.

'''JobShopLean''' is a concept for applying the philosophy of Lean to the type of usually small manufacturing organization known as a [[job shop]]. 

Unlike continuous (Flow) manufacturing as practised by Toyota, this manufacturing is characterized by skilled hourly employees such as machinists, diemakers, welders, pipefitters, painters, etc. that perform non-repetitive manufacturing operations, often based on them determine the manufacturing processes and sequences. [[Lean manufacturing]] is the concept of doing all this as efficiently as possible.

'''Koch's giant day gecko''' (''Phelsuma madagascariensis kochi'' ) is a [[Diurnality|diurnal]] [[subspecies]] of [[gecko]], a lizard in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Gekkonidae]]. The subspecies is native to northwestern and western [[Madagascar]] and typically inhabits trees. It feeds on insects and nectar.

==Etymology==
The subspecific name, ''kochi'', is in honor of German [[Ornithology|ornithologist]] and [[Herpetology|herpetologist]] K.L. Koch of the ''Naturmuseum Senckenberg'' in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. (''Phelsuma madagascariensis kochi'', p. 144).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Koch's giant day gecko is often treated as its own species, ''Phelsuma kochi'' &lt;small&gt;Mertens, 1954&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name="RDB"&gt;{{NRDB species|genus=Phelsuma|species=kochi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''P. m. kochi'' is among the largest living day geckos. It can reach a total length (including tail) of {{convert|30.5|cm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;Glaw F, [[Miguel Vences|Vences M]] (2007). ''A Field Guide to the Amphibians and Reptiles of Madagascar.'' Third edition. {{ISBN|978-3-929449-03-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body colour is a dark, dull green. A faint red stripe extends from the nostril to the eye. On the back there may be little reddish dots present. The neck and flanks often are light grey. The ventral side is off-white.

==Geographic range==
''P. m. kochi'' is widely distributed in northwestern and western Madagascar on the coast and in the inland. It was first discovered in the region around [[Maevatanana]].

==Habitat==
''P. m. kochi'' is often found on different trees such as banana trees where it can be seen basking. It avoids human dwellings. The climate is very dry throughout the year and the temperature can be as high as 40&amp;nbsp;°C (104&amp;nbsp;°F).

==Diet==
Koch's giant day gecko feeds on various insects and other invertebrates. It also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

==Behaviour==
This subspecies, ''P. m. kochi'', is not quite as quarrelsome and aggressive as ''[[Phelsuma madagascariensis madagascariensis|P. m. madagascariensis]]'' and ''[[Phelsuma madagascariensis grandis|P. m. grandis]]''.

==Reproduction==
The pairing season for ''P. m. kochi'' is between November and the first weeks of May. During this period, the sexually mature females lay up to 6 pairs of eggs. At a temperature of 28&amp;nbsp;°C (82&amp;nbsp;°F), the young will hatch after approximately 63&amp;ndash;68 days. The juveniles measure {{convert|65|mm|in|abbr=on}} and reach sexual maturity after one year.

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
''P. m. kochi'' should be housed in pairs although successful group breeding with one male and several females has been reported. They need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be about 28&amp;nbsp;°C (82&amp;nbsp;°F) during the day. The humidity should be maintained around 65%. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets,  wax moths, fruit flies, mealworms, and houseflies.

A '''lattice''' is an abstract structure studied in the [[mathematics|mathematical]] subdisciplines of [[order theory]] and [[abstract algebra]]. It consists of a [[partially ordered set]] in which every two elements have a unique [[supremum]] (also called a least upper bound or [[Join and meet|join]]) and a unique [[infimum]] (also called a greatest lower bound or [[Join and meet|meet]]). An example is given by the [[natural number]]s, partially ordered by [[divisibility]], for which the unique supremum is the [[least common multiple]] and the unique infimum is the [[greatest common divisor]].

Lattices can also be characterized as [[algebraic structure]]s satisfying certain [[axiom]]atic [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]]. Since the two definitions are equivalent, lattice theory draws on both [[order theory]] and [[universal algebra]]. [[Semilattice]]s include lattices, which in turn include [[Heyting algebra|Heyting]] and [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s. These "lattice-like" structures all admit [[order theory|order-theoretic]] as well as algebraic descriptions.

== Lattices as partially ordered sets ==
&lt;!---joined into examples section: [[File:Lattice of partitions of an order 4 set.svg|thumb|360px|The name "lattice" is suggested by the form of the [[Hasse diagram]] depicting it. Shown here is the lattice of [[partition (set theory)|partition]]s of a four-element set&amp;nbsp;{{nowrap|{1, 2, 3, 4},}} ordered by the relation "is a refinement of".]]---&gt;

If {{nowrap|(''L'', ≤)}} is a [[partially ordered set]] (poset), and {{nowrap|''S'' ⊆ ''L''}} is an arbitrary subset, then an element {{nowrap|''u'' ∈ ''L''}} is said to be an '''upper bound''' of ''S'' if {{nowrap|''s'' ≤ ''u''}} for each {{nowrap|''s'' ∈ ''S''}}. A set may have many upper bounds, or none at all. An upper bound ''u'' of ''S'' is said to be its '''least upper bound''', or '''[[Join (mathematics)|join]]''', or '''supremum''', if {{nowrap|''u'' ≤ ''x''}} for each upper bound ''x'' of ''S''. A set need not have a least upper bound, but it cannot have more than one. [[duality (order theory)|Dually]], {{nowrap|''l'' ∈ ''L''}} is said to be a '''lower bound''' of ''S'' if {{nowrap|''l'' ≤ ''s''}} for each {{nowrap|''s'' ∈ ''S''}}. A lower bound ''l'' of ''S'' is said to be its '''greatest lower bound''', or '''[[meet (mathematics)|meet]]''', or '''infimum''', if {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''l''}} for each lower bound ''x'' of ''S''. A set may have many lower bounds, or none at all, but can have at most one greatest lower bound.

A partially ordered set {{nowrap|(''L'', ≤)}} is called a '''[[join-semilattice]]''' if each two-element subset {{nowrap|{''a'', ''b''} ⊆ ''L''}} has a join (i.e. least upper bound), and is called a '''[[meet-semilattice]]''' if each two-element subset has a meet (i.e. greatest lower bound), denoted by {{nowrap|''a'' ∨ ''b''}} and {{nowrap|''a'' ∧ ''b''}} respectively. {{nowrap|(''L'', ≤)}} is called a '''lattice''' if it is both a join- and a meet-semilattice. 
This definition makes ∨ and ∧ [[binary operation]]s. Both operations are monotone with respect to the order: {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} implies that {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

It follows by an [[mathematical induction|induction]] argument that every non-empty finite subset of a lattice has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound. With additional assumptions, further conclusions may be possible; ''see'' [[Completeness (order theory)]] for more discussion of this subject. That article also discusses how one may rephrase the above definition in terms of the existence of suitable [[Galois connection]]s between related partially ordered sets — an approach of special interest for the [[category theory|category theoretic]] approach to lattices, and for [[formal concept analysis]].

A '''bounded lattice''' is a lattice that additionally has a '''[[greatest element|greatest]]''' element (also called '''maximum''', or '''top''' element, and denoted by 1, or by &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;) and a '''[[least element|least]]''' element (also called '''minimum''', or '''bottom''', denoted by 0 or by &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt;), which satisfy
: 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1 for every ''x'' in ''L''.
Every lattice can be embedded into a bounded lattice by adding an artificial greatest and least element, and every non-empty finite lattice is bounded, by taking the join (resp., meet) of all elements, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\bigvee L=a_1\lor\cdots\lor a_n&lt;/math&gt; (resp.&lt;math&gt;\bigwedge L=a_1\land\cdots\land a_n&lt;/math&gt;) where &lt;math&gt;L=\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}&lt;/math&gt;.

A partially ordered set is a bounded lattice if and only if every finite set of elements (including the empty set) has a join and a meet. For every element ''x'' of a poset it is trivially true (it is a [[vacuous truth]]) that 
&lt;math&gt;\forall a\in\varnothing :  x \le a&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\forall a\in\varnothing :  a \le x&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore every element of a poset is both an upper bound and a lower bound of the empty set.  This implies that the join of an empty set is the least element &lt;math&gt;\bigvee\varnothing=0&lt;/math&gt;, and the meet of the empty set is the greatest element &lt;math&gt;\bigwedge\varnothing=1&lt;/math&gt;. This is consistent with the associativity and commutativity of meet and join: the join of a union of finite sets is equal to the join of the joins of the sets, and dually, the meet of a union of finite sets is equal to the meet of the meets of the sets, i.e., for finite subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of a poset ''L'',

:&lt;math&gt;\bigvee \left( A \cup B \right)= \left( \bigvee A \right) \vee \left( \bigvee B \right)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\bigwedge \left( A \cup B \right)= \left(\bigwedge A \right) \wedge \left( \bigwedge B \right)&lt;/math&gt;

hold. Taking ''B'' to be the empty set,

:&lt;math&gt;\bigvee \left( A \cup \emptyset \right)
= \left( \bigvee A \right) \vee \left( \bigvee \emptyset \right)
= \left( \bigvee A \right) \vee 0
= \bigvee A&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\bigwedge \left( A \cup \emptyset \right)
= \left( \bigwedge A \right) \wedge \left( \bigwedge \emptyset \right)
= \left( \bigwedge A \right) \wedge 1
= \bigwedge A&lt;/math&gt;

which is consistent with the fact that &lt;math&gt;A \cup \emptyset = A&lt;/math&gt;.

A lattice element ''y'' is said to '''[[covering relation|cover]]''' another element ''x'', if {{nowrap|''y'' &gt; ''x''}}, but there does not exist a ''z'' such that {{nowrap|''y'' &gt; ''z'' &gt; ''x''}}.
Here, {{nowrap|''y'' &gt; ''x''}} means {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} and {{nowrap|''x'' ≠ ''y''}}.

A lattice {{nowrap|(''L'', ≤)}} is called '''[[Graded poset|graded]]''', sometimes '''ranked''' (but see [[Ranked poset]] for an alternative meaning), if it can be equipped with a '''rank function''' ''r'' from ''L'' to ℕ, sometimes to ℤ, compatible with the ordering (so {{nowrap|''r''(''x'') &amp;lt; ''r''(''y'')}} whenever {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;lt; ''y''}}) such that whenever ''y'' covers ''x'', then {{nowrap|1=''r''(''y'') = ''r''(''x'') + 1}}.  The value of the rank function for a lattice element is called its '''rank'''.

Given a subset of a lattice, {{nowrap|''H'' ⊂ ''L''}}, meet and join restrict to [[partial function]]s – they are undefined if their value is not in the subset ''H''. The resulting structure on ''H'' is called a '''{{visible anchor|partial lattice}}'''. In addition to this extrinsic definition as a subset of some other algebraic structure (a lattice), a partial lattice can also be intrinsically defined as a set with two partial binary operations satisfying certain axioms.{{sfn|Grätzer|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SoGLVCPuOz0C&amp;pg=PA52 52]}}

== Lattices as algebraic structures ==

===General lattice===
An [[algebraic structure]] {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧)}}, consisting of a set ''L'' and two binary [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]] ∨, and ∧, on ''L'' is a '''lattice''' if the following axiomatic identities hold for all elements ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' of ''L''.

The following two identities are also usually regarded as axioms, even though they follow from the two absorption laws taken together.&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{nowrap|1=''a'' ∨ ''a'' = ''a'' ∨ (''a'' ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''a'')) = ''a''}}, and dually for the other idempotent law. {{Citation | last1=Dedekind | first1=Richard | author1-link=Richard Dedekind | title=Über Zerlegungen von Zahlen durch ihre grössten gemeinsamen Teiler | year=1897 | journal=Braunschweiger Festschrift | pages=1–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Idempotence|Idempotent laws]]
:''a'' ∨ ''a'' = ''a'',
:''a'' ∧ ''a'' = ''a''.

These axioms assert that both {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨)}} and {{nowrap|(''L'', ∧)}} are [[semilattice]]s. The absorption laws, the only axioms above in which both meet and join appear, distinguish a lattice from an arbitrary pair of semilattices and assure that the two semilattices interact appropriately. In particular, each semilattice is the [[Duality (order theory)|dual]] of the other.

===Bounded lattice===
A '''bounded lattice''' is an algebraic structure of the form {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧, 0, 1)}} such that {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧)}} is a lattice, 0 (the lattice's bottom) is the [[identity element]] for the join operation ∨, and 1 (the lattice's top) is the identity element for the meet operation ∧.

;[[Identity (mathematics)|Identity laws]]
:''a'' ∨ 0 = ''a'',
:''a'' ∧ 1 = ''a''.

See [[semilattice]] for further details.

===Connection to other algebraic structures===
Lattices have some connections to the family of [[magma (algebra)|group-like algebraic structures]]. Because meet and join both commute and associate, a lattice can be viewed as consisting of two commutative [[semigroups]] having the same domain. For a bounded lattice, these semigroups are in fact commutative [[monoid]]s. The [[absorption law]] is the only defining identity that is peculiar to lattice theory.

By commutativity and associativity one can think of join and meet as binary operations that are defined on non-empty finite sets, rather than on elements. In a bounded lattice the empty join and the empty meet can also be defined (as 0 and 1, respectively). This makes bounded lattices somewhat more natural than general lattices, and many authors require all lattices to be bounded.

The algebraic interpretation of lattices plays an essential role in [[universal algebra]].

== Connection between the two definitions ==
An order-theoretic lattice gives rise to the two binary operations ∨ and ∧. Since the commutative, associative and absorption laws can easily be verified for these operations, they make {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧)}} into a lattice in the algebraic sense.

The converse is also true. Given an algebraically defined lattice {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧)}}, one can define a partial order ≤ on ''L'' by setting
: {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} if  {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''a'' ∧ ''b''}}, or
: {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} if  {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''a'' ∨ ''b''}},
for all elements ''a'' and ''b'' from ''L''. The laws of absorption ensure that both definitions are equivalent:

''a'' = ''a'' ∧ ''b'' implies ''b'' = ''b'' ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''a'') = (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ ''b'' = ''a'' ∨ ''b''

and dually for the other direction.

One can now check that the relation ≤ introduced in this way defines a partial ordering within which binary meets and joins are given through the original operations ∨ and ∧.

Since the two definitions of a lattice are equivalent, one may freely invoke aspects of either definition in any way that suits the purpose at hand.

* For any set ''A'', the collection of all subsets of ''A'' (called the [[power set]] of ''A'') can be ordered via [[subset|subset inclusion]] to obtain a lattice bounded by ''A'' itself and the null set. Set [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[union (set theory)|union]] interpret meet and join, respectively (see pic.1).
* For any set ''A'', the collection of all finite subsets of ''A'', ordered by inclusion, is also a lattice, and will be bounded if and only if ''A'' is finite.
* For any set ''A'', the collection of all [[partition of a set|partition]]s of ''A'', ordered by [[partition of a set|refinement]], is a lattice (see pic.3).
* The [[natural number|positive integers]] in their usual order form a lattice, under the operations of "min" and "max". 1 is bottom; there is no top (see pic.4).
* The [[Cartesian square]] of the natural numbers, ordered so that {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'') ≤ (''c'', ''d'')}} if {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''c''}} and {{nowrap|''b'' ≤ ''d''}}. The pair {{nowrap|(0, 0)}} is the bottom element; there is no top (see pic.5).
* The natural numbers also form a lattice under the operations of taking the [[greatest common divisor]] and [[least common multiple]], with [[divisibility]] as the order relation: {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} if ''a'' divides ''b''. 1 is bottom; 0 is top. Pic.2 shows a finite sublattice.
* Every [[complete lattice]] (also see [[#Completeness|below]]) is a (rather specific) bounded lattice. This class gives rise to a broad range of practical [[Complete lattice#Examples|examples]].
* The set of [[compact element]]s of an [[arithmetic lattice|arithmetic]] complete lattice is a lattice with a least element, where the lattice operations are given by restricting the respective operations of the arithmetic lattice. This is the specific property which distinguishes arithmetic lattices from [[algebraic lattice]]s, for which the compacts do only form a [[semilattice|join-semilattice]]. Both of these classes of complete lattices are studied in [[domain theory]].

Most partial ordered sets are not lattices, including the following.

* A discrete poset, meaning a poset such that {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}}, is a lattice if and only if it has at most one element.  In particular the two-element discrete poset is not a lattice.
* Although the set {{nowrap|{1, 2, 3, 6}{{null}}}} partially ordered by divisibility is a lattice, the set {{nowrap|{1, 2, 3}{{null}}}} so ordered is not a lattice because the pair 2, 3 lacks a join, and it lacks a meet in {{nowrap|{2, 3, 6}.}}
* The set {{nowrap|{1, 2, 3, 12, 18, 36}{{null}}}} partially ordered by divisibility is not a lattice.  Every pair of elements has an upper bound and a lower bound, but the pair 2, 3 has three upper bounds, namely 12, 18, and 36, none of which is the least of those three under divisibility (12 and 18 do not divide each other).  Likewise the pair 12, 18 has three lower bounds, namely 1, 2, and 3, none of which is the greatest of those three under divisibility (2 and 3 do not divide each other).

== Morphisms of lattices ==
[[File:Monotonic but nonhomomorphic map between lattices.gif|thumb|'''Pic.9:''' Monotonic map ''f'' between lattices that preserves neither joins nor meets, since {{nowrap|''f''(''u'') ∨ ''f''(''v'')}} {{nowrap|1== ''u''′ ∨ ''u''′}} {{nowrap|1== ''u''′ ≠ 1′}} {{nowrap|1== ''f''(1) = ''f''(''u'' ∨ ''v'')}} and {{nowrap|''f''(''u'') ∧ ''f''(''v'')}} {{nowrap|1== ''u''′ ∧ ''u''′}} {{nowrap|1== ''u''′ ≠ 0′}} {{nowrap|1== ''f''(0) = ''f''(''u'' ∧ ''v'')}}.]]
The appropriate notion of a [[morphism]] between two lattices flows easily from the [[#Lattices as algebraic structures|above]] algebraic definition. Given two lattices {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;, ∧&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{nowrap|(''M'', ∨&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;, ∧&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, a '''lattice homomorphism''' from ''L'' to ''M'' is a function {{nowrap|''f'' : ''L'' → ''M''}} such that for all {{nowrap|''a'', ''b'' ∈ ''L''}}:

: ''f''(''a'' ∨&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ∨&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''(''b''), and
: ''f''(''a'' ∧&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ∧&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''(''b'').

Thus ''f'' is a [[homomorphism]] of the two underlying [[semilattice]]s. When lattices with more structure are considered, the morphisms should "respect" the extra structure, too. In particular, a '''bounded-lattice homomorphism''' (usually called just "lattice homomorphism") ''f'' between two bounded lattices ''L'' and ''M'' should also have the following property:

: ''f''(0&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; , and
: ''f''(1&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; .

In the order-theoretic formulation, these conditions just state that a homomorphism of lattices is a function [[limit preserving function (order theory)|preserving]] binary meets and joins. For bounded lattices, preservation of least and greatest elements is just preservation of join and meet of the empty set.

Any homomorphism of lattices is necessarily [[monotone function|monotone]] with respect to the associated ordering relation; see [[limit preserving function (order theory)|preservation of limits]]. The converse is not true: monotonicity by no means implies the required preservation of meets and joins (see pic.9), although an [[Monotonic function|order-preserving]] [[bijection]] is a homomorphism if its [[inverse function|inverse]] is also order-preserving.

Given the standard definition of [[isomorphism]]s as invertible morphisms, a ''lattice isomorphism'' is just a [[bijective]] lattice homomorphism. Similarly, a ''lattice endomorphism'' is a lattice homomorphism from a lattice to itself, and a ''lattice automorphism'' is a bijective lattice endomorphism.  Lattices and their homomorphisms form a [[category theory|category]].

== Sublattices ==
A ''sublattice'' of a lattice ''L'' is a nonempty subset of ''L'' that is a lattice with the same meet and join operations as ''L''.  That is, if ''L'' is a lattice and {{nowrap|''M'' ≠ &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;}} is a subset of ''L'' such that for every pair of elements ''a'', ''b'' in ''M'' both {{nowrap|''a'' ∧ ''b''}} and {{nowrap|''a'' ∨ ''b''}} are in ''M'', then ''M'' is a sublattice of ''L''.&lt;ref&gt;Burris, Stanley N., and H.P. Sankappanavar, H. P., 1981. [http://www.thoralf.uwaterloo.ca/htdocs/ualg.html ''A Course in Universal Algebra''.]  Springer-Verlag. {{isbn|3-540-90578-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A sublattice ''M'' of a lattice ''L'' is a ''convex sublattice'' of ''L'', if {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''z'' ≤ ''y''}} and ''x'', ''y'' in ''M'' implies that ''z'' belongs to ''M'', for all elements ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''L''.

== Properties of lattices ==
{{further|Map of lattices}}
We now introduce a number of important properties that lead to interesting special classes of lattices. One, boundedness, has already been discussed.

=== Completeness ===
{{main|Complete lattice}}
A poset is called a '''complete lattice''' if ''all'' its subsets have both a join and a meet. In particular, every complete lattice is a bounded lattice. While bounded lattice homomorphisms in general preserve only finite joins and meets, complete lattice homomorphisms are required to preserve arbitrary joins and meets.

Every poset that is a complete semilattice is also a complete lattice. Related to this result is the interesting phenomenon that there are various competing notions of homomorphism for this class of posets, depending on whether they are seen as complete lattices, complete join-semilattices, complete meet-semilattices, or as join-complete or meet-complete lattices.

Note that "partial lattice" is not the opposite of "complete lattice" – rather, "partial lattice", "lattice", and "complete lattice" are increasingly restrictive definitions.

=== Conditional completeness ===
A '''conditionally complete lattice''' is a lattice in which every ''nonempty'' subset ''that has an upper bound'' has a join (i.e., a least upper bound).  Such lattices provide the most direct generalization of the [[completeness axiom]] of the [[real number]]s.  A conditionally complete lattice is either a complete lattice, or a complete lattice without its maximum element 1, its minimum element 0, or both.

=== Distributivity ===
{| style="float:right"
|-
| [[File:N 5 mit Beschriftung.svg|thumb|x150px|'''Pic.11:''' Smallest non-modular (and hence non-distributive) lattice N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;br&gt;The labelled elements violate the distributivity equation {{nowrap|1=''c'' ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''b'') = (''c'' ∧ ''a'') ∨ (''c'' ∧ ''b'')}}, but satisfy its dual {{nowrap|1=''c'' ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''b'') = (''c'' ∨ ''a'') ∧ (''c'' ∨ ''b'')}}.]]

| [[File:M 3 mit Beschriftung.svg|thumb|x150px|'''Pic.10:''' Smallest non-distributive (but modular) lattice M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
|}
{{main|Distributive lattice}}
Since lattices come with two binary operations, it is natural to ask whether one of them [[distributivity|distributes]] over the other, i.e. whether one or the other of the following [[duality (order theory)|dual]] laws holds for every three elements ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' of ''L'':

;Distributivity of ∨ over ∧
: ''a'' ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''c'').
;Distributivity of ∧ over ∨
: ''a'' ∧ (''b'' ∨ ''c'') = (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''c'').

A lattice that satisfies the first or, equivalently (as it turns out), the second axiom, is called a '''distributive lattice'''.
The only non-distributive lattices with fewer than 6 elements are called M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Davey|Priestley|2002}}, Exercise 4.1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vVVTxeuiyvQC&amp;pg=PA104 p.&amp;nbsp;104].&lt;/ref&gt; they are shown in picture 10 and 11, respectively. A lattice is distributive if and only if it doesn't have a [[#Sublattices|sublattice]] isomorphic to M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Davey.Priestley.2002.10.6"&gt;{{harvtxt|Davey|Priestley|2002}}, Theorem 4.10, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vVVTxeuiyvQC&amp;pg=PA89 p.&amp;nbsp;89].&lt;/ref&gt; Each distributive lattice is isomorphic to a lattice of sets (with union and intersection as join and meet, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Davey|Priestley|2002}}, Theorem 10.21, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vVVTxeuiyvQC&amp;pg=PA238 pp.&amp;nbsp;238–239].&lt;/ref&gt;

For an overview of stronger notions of distributivity which are appropriate for complete lattices and which are used to define more special classes of lattices such as [[complete Heyting algebra|frames]] and [[completely distributive lattice]]s, see [[distributivity (order theory)|distributivity in order theory]].

===Modularity===
{{main|Modular lattice}}
For some applications the distributivity condition is too strong, and the following weaker property is often useful. A lattice {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧)}} is '''modular''' if, for all elements ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' of ''L'', the following identity holds.
;'''Modular identity''': (''a'' ∧ ''c'') ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = [(''a'' ∧ ''c'') ∨ ''b''] ∧ ''c''.
This condition is equivalent to the following axiom.
;'''Modular law''': {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''c''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''a'' ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ ''c''}}.
A lattice is modular if and only if it doesn't have a [[#Sublattices|sublattice]] isomorphic to N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (shown in pic.11).&lt;ref name="Davey.Priestley.2002.10.6"/&gt; 
Besides distributive lattices, examples of modular lattices are the lattice of [[two-sided ideal]]s of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], the lattice of submodules of a [[module (mathematics)|module]], and the lattice of [[normal subgroup]]s of a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. The [[Subsumption lattice|set of first-order terms]] with the ordering "''is more specific than''" is a non-modular lattice used in [[automated reasoning]].

===Semimodularity===
{{main|Semimodular lattice}}
A finite lattice is modular if and only if it is both upper and lower [[semimodular lattice|semimodular]]. For a graded lattice, (upper) semimodularity is equivalent to the following condition on the rank function ''r'':
:''r''(''x'') + ''r''(''y'') ≥ ''r''(''x'' ∧ ''y'') + ''r''(''x'' ∨ ''y'').
Another equivalent (for graded lattices) condition is Birkhoff's condition:
: for each ''x'' and ''y'' in ''L'', if ''x'' and ''y'' both cover {{nowrap|''x'' ∧ ''y''}}, then {{nowrap|''x'' ∨ ''y''}} covers both ''x'' and ''y''.

A lattice is called lower semimodular if its dual is semimodular. For finite lattices this means that the previous conditions hold with ∨ and ∧ exchanged, "covers" exchanged with "is covered by", and inequalities reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Stanley | first=Richard P | authorlink=Richard P. Stanley | title=Enumerative Combinatorics (vol. 1) | publisher=Cambridge University Press | pages=103–104 | isbn=0-521-66351-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continuity and algebraicity ===

In [[domain theory]], it is natural to seek to approximate the elements in a partial order by "much simpler" elements. This leads to the class of [[continuous poset]]s, consisting of posets where every element can be obtained as the supremum of a [[directed set]] of elements that are [[way-below relation|way-below]] the element. If one can additionally restrict these to the [[compact element]]s of a poset for obtaining these directed sets, then the poset is even [[algebraic poset|algebraic]]. Both concepts can be applied to lattices as follows:

* A '''continuous lattice''' is a complete lattice that is continuous as a poset.
* An '''[[algebraic lattice]]''' is a complete lattice that is algebraic as a poset.

Both of these classes have interesting properties. For example, continuous lattices can be characterized as algebraic structures (with infinitary operations) satisfying certain identities. While such a characterization is not known for algebraic lattices, they can be described "syntactically" via [[Scott information system]]s.

=== Complements and pseudo-complements ===
Let ''L'' be a bounded lattice with greatest element 1 and least element 0. Two elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''L'' are '''complements''' of each other if and only if:

: {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∨ ''y'' = 1}} and {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∧ ''y'' = 0}}.

In general, some elements of a bounded lattice might not have a complement, and others might have more than one complement. For example, the set {0, ½, 1} with its usual ordering is a bounded lattice, and ½ does not have a complement. In the bounded lattice N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, the element ''a'' has two complements, viz. ''b'' and ''c'' (see Pic.11). A bounded lattice for which every element has a complement is called a [[complemented lattice]]. 

A complemented lattice that is also distributive is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]. For a distributive lattice, the complement of ''x'', when it exists, is unique.

In the case the complement is unique, we write {{nowrap|1=¬''x'' = ''y''}} and equivalently, {{nowrap|1=¬''y'' = ''x''}}. The corresponding unary [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]] over ''L'', called complementation, introduces an analogue of logical [[negation]] into lattice theory.

[[Heyting algebra]]s are an example of distributive lattices where some members might be lacking complements. Every element ''x'' of a Heyting algebra has, on the other hand, a ''pseudo-complement'', also denoted ¬''x''. The pseudo-complement is the greatest element ''y'' such that {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∧ ''y'' = 0}}. If the pseudo-complement of every element of a Heyting algebra is in fact a complement, then the Heyting algebra is in fact a Boolean algebra.

=== Jordan–Dedekind chain condition ===
A '''chain''' from ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a set &lt;math&gt;\{ x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x_0 &lt; x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; x_n&lt;/math&gt;.
The '''length''' of this chain is ''n'', or one less than its number of elements. A chain is '''maximal''' if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; covers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt; 
for all {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''}}.

If for any pair, ''x'' and ''y'', where {{nowrap|''x'' &lt; ''y''}}, all maximal chains from ''x'' to ''y'' have the same length, then the lattice is said to satisfy the '''Jordan–Dedekind chain condition'''.

== Free lattices ==
{{main|Free lattice}}
Any set ''X'' may be used to generate the '''free semilattice''' ''FX''. The free semilattice is defined to consist of all of the finite subsets of ''X'', with the semilattice operation given by ordinary [[set union]].  The free semilattice has the [[universal property]]. For the '''free lattice''' over a set ''X'', [[Philip M. Whitman|Whitman]] gave a construction based on polynomials over ''X''{{'}}s members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Philip Whitman | title=Free Lattices I | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] | volume=42 |  pages=325–329 |  year=1941 | doi=10.2307/1969001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Philip Whitman | title=Free Lattices II | journal=Annals of Mathematics | volume=43 |  pages=104–115 |  year=1942 | doi=10.2307/1968883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Important lattice-theoretic notions ==
We now define some order-theoretic notions of importance to lattice theory. In the following, let ''x'' be an element of some lattice ''L''. If ''L'' has a bottom element 0, {{nowrap|''x'' ≠ 0}} is sometimes required. ''x'' is called:
*'''Join irreducible''' if {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''a'' ∨ ''b''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''a''}} or {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''b''}} for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''L''. When the first condition is generalized to arbitrary joins &lt;math&gt;\bigvee_{i \in I} a_i&lt;/math&gt;, ''x'' is called '''completely join irreducible''' (or ∨-irreducible). The dual notion is '''meet irreducibility''' (∧-irreducible). For example, in pic.2, the elements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are join irreducible, while 12, 15, 20, and 30 are meet irreducible. In the lattice of [[real numbers]] with the usual order, each element is join irreducible, but none is completely join irreducible.
*'''Join prime''' if {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''a'' ∨ ''b''}} implies {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''a''}} or {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''b''}}. This too can be generalized to obtain the notion '''completely join prime'''. The dual notion is '''meet prime'''. Every join-prime element is also join irreducible, and every meet-prime element is also meet irreducible. The converse holds if ''L'' is distributive.

Let ''L'' have a bottom element 0. An element ''x'' of ''L'' is an [[atom (order theory)|atom]] if {{nowrap|0 &lt; ''x''}} and there exists no element ''y'' of ''L'' such that {{nowrap|0 &lt; ''y'' &lt; ''x''}}. Then ''L'' is called:
* [[atomic (order theory)|Atomic]] if for every nonzero element ''x'' of ''L'', there exists an atom ''a'' of ''L'' such that {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''x''}};
* [[atomic (order theory)|Atomistic]] if every element of ''L'' is a [[supremum]] of atoms.

The notions of [[ideal (order theory)|ideal]]s and the dual notion of [[filter (mathematics)|filters]] refer to particular kinds of [[subset]]s of a partially ordered set, and are therefore important for lattice theory. Details can be found in the respective entries.

The law of North America is diverse and influential. The [[law of the United States]] has worldwide renown, in its codified constitution, and [[bill of rights]], while the [[law of Cuba]] differs vastly in its regulation of private property. The first court of justice was established in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Canada]] in 1615 by Sir [[Richard Whitbourne]] as a [[court of admiralty]] at the future site of [[Trinity, Newfoundland and Labrador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/canada/Alberta-to-Nova-Scotia/Newfoundland-and-Labrador.html |title=Newfoundland and Labrador |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=Nations Encyclopedia |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4557">A '''mental state''' is a state of mind that an [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] is in. Most simplistically, a mental state is a mental condition. It is a relation that connects the agent with a proposition. Several of these states are a combination of [[mental representation]]s and [[propositional attitude]]s. There are several paradigmatic states of mind that an agent has:  [[love]], [[hate]], [[pleasure]] and [[pain]], and attitudes toward propositions such as: [[belief|believing]] that, [[concept|conceiving]] that, [[hope|hoping]] and [[fear|fearing]] that, etc.

== Mental states and academia ==
Discussions about mental states can be found in many areas of study.

In [[cognitive psychology]] and the [[philosophy of mind]], a mental state is a kind of hypothetical state that corresponds to thinking and feeling, and consists of a conglomeration of [[mental representation]]s and propositional attitudes. Several theories in philosophy and psychology try to determine the relationship between the agent's mental state and a proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Putnam|first=Hilary|date=1967|title=The Nature of Mental States|url=|journal=PhilPapers|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piccinini|first=Gualtiero|date=2004|title=Functionalism, Computationalism, &amp; Mental States|url=|journal=Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science|issue=35.4|pages=811–33|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Irwin|date=2000|title=Intersubjective Properties by Which We Specify Pain, Pleasure, and Other Kinds of Mental States.|url=|journal=Philosophy|issue=|pages=89–104|doi=10.1017/s0031819100000073|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weintraub|first=Ruth|date=1987|title=Unconscious Mental States|url=|journal=Philosophical Quarterly|issue=37 (October)|pages=423–32|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of looking into what a mental state is, in itself, [[clinical psychology]] and [[psychiatry]] determine a person's mental health through a [[mental status examination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Stan|date=2015|title=The Feeling of Personal Ownership of One’s Mental States: A Conceptual Argument and Empirical Evidence for an Essential, but Underappreciated, Mechanism of Mind.|url=|journal=Psychology of Consciousness: Research, Practice, and Theory|issue=2|pages=355–76|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epistemology ==
Mental states also include attitudes towards propositions, of which there are at least two—[[Factive verb|factive]], non-factive, both of which entail the mental state of acquaintance. To be acquainted with a proposition is to understand its meaning and be able to entertain it. The proposition can be true or false, and acquaintance requires no specific attitude towards that truth or falsity. Factive attitudes include those mental states that are attached to the truth of the proposition—i.e. the proposition entails truth. Some factive mental states include "perceiving that", "remembering that", "regretting that", and (more controversially) "knowing that".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowledge And Its Limits|last=Williamson|first=Timothy|publisher=Oxford Blackwell Publishing|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-factive attitudes do not entail the truth of the propositions to which they are attached. That is, one can be in one of these mental states and the proposition can be false. An example of a non-factive attitude is believing—you can believe a false proposition and you can believe a true proposition. Since you have the possibility of both, such mental states do not entail truth, and therefore, are not factive. However, belief does entail an attitude of assent toward the presumed truth of the proposition (whether or not it's so), making it and other non-factive attitudes different than mere acquaintance.

{{mythology}}
In [[structuralism]]-influenced studies of [[mythology]], a '''mytheme''' is a fundamental generic unit of narrative structure (typically involving a relationship between a character, an event, and a theme) from which myths are thought to be constructed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mytheme|title=mytheme - Definition of mytheme in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Similarly, in [[memetics]]  a [[meme]] is the smallest memetic unit that has [[semantics|semantic]] [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and in a language or dialect, a [[phoneme]] (from the {{lang-el|φώνημα}}, ''phōnēma'', "a sound uttered") is the smallest [[segment (linguistics)|segmental]] unit of sound employed to form meaningful contrasts between utterances.&lt;/ref&gt;—a minimal unit that is always found shared with other, related mythemes{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} and reassembled in various ways ("bundled")&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss: "the true constituent units of a myth are not the isolated relations but bundles of such relations" (Lévi-Strauss 1963:211).&lt;/ref&gt; or linked in more complicated relationships. For example, the myths of [[Adonis]] and [[Osiris]] share several elements, leading some scholars to conclude that they share a source, i.e. images passed down in cultures or from one to another, being ascribed new interpretations of the action depicted, as well as new names in various readings of [[symbol|icon]]s.

==Overview==
[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] (1908–2009), who gave the term wide circulation,&lt;ref&gt;First described, as a "gross constituent unit", in {{cite journal
 | first = Claude | last = Lévi-Strauss | authorlink = Claude Lévi-Strauss
 | year = 1955 | title = The Structural study of myth
 | journal = [[Journal of American Folklore]] | volume = 68 | pages =  428–444
 | issn = 0021-8715 | oclc = 1782260 
 | doi = 10.2307/536768
 | jstor = 536768
 | issue = 270
}} reprinted as "The structural study of myth", ''Structural Anthropology'', 1963:206-31; the term ''mytheme'' first appears in Lévi-Strauss' 1958 French version of the work.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote, "If one wants to establish a parallel between [[structural linguistics]] and the structural analysis of myths, the correspondence is established, not between mytheme and word but between mytheme and [[phoneme]]."&lt;ref&gt;
Lévi-Strauss, ''La poetière jalouse'', Paris, 1985 (''The Jealous Potter'', Chicago, 1988) pp 144-46.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[structuralism|structuralist]] analyzer of [[Folklore|folk tale]]s, [[Vladimir Propp]], treated the individual tale as the unit of analysis. The unitary mytheme, by contrast, is the equivalent in myth of the [[phoneme]]s, [[morpheme]]s, and [[sememe]]s into which [[Linguistics|structural linguistics]] divides language, the smallest possible units of sound, structure, and meaning (respectively) within a language [[system]].

In the 1950s Claude Lévi-Strauss first adapted this technique of language analysis to analytic myth criticism. In his work on the myth systems of primitive tribes, working from the analogy of [[language structure]], he adopted the French term ''mythème'', with the assertion that the system of meaning within mythic utterances parallels closely that of a language system. [[Roman Jakobson]] varies this idea, treating mythemes as [[concept]]s or phonemes which have no significance in themselves but whose significance might be shown by [[sociology|sociological]] analysis.

Philosophers such as [[Daniel Dennett]] have also used the term "mytheme".

[[Lev Manovich]] uses the terms ''seme'' and ''mytheme'' in his book, ''The Language of New Media'', to describe aspects of culture that computer images enter into dialog with.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6004">The '''National Campus Climate Survey (NCCS)''' is a service offered to institutions of [[higher education]] in the [[United States]] who would like to better understand and improve their campus climate with regards to [[sexual assault]] and related topics.  The study is designed to:

# Meet all state and federal requirements for the conduct of sexual assault [[Survey methodology|survey]]s.
# Provide a scientifically rigorous survey instrument to help schools learn about the campus climate concerning [[sexual misconduct]].
# Provide varying survey implementation tiers to match institutions’ varying needs for defensible data.
# Provide a benchmarking tool to allow institutions to compare their results against other participating institutions, and where possible, peer groups.

The National Campus Climate Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schlissel|first1=Mark|title=U-M 2015 Campus Climate Surveys Regarding Sexual Misconduct|url=https://publicaffairs.vpcomm.umich.edu/key-issues/faq-on-2015-campus-climate-surveys-regarding-sexual-misconduct/|website=U-M Public Affairs &amp; Internal Communications|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed at the [[University of Michigan]] in collaboration with a local survey research firm, SoundRocket (formerly known as Survey Sciences Group, LLC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SoundRocket: A name is selected|url=http://www.soundrocket.com/soundrocket-blog/2015/7/21/our-story-part-5|website=SoundRocket|publisher=The Launch Pad Blog|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study was developed in response to the report from the [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault]].

== The National Campus Climate Survey ==

=== Study Website &amp; Enrollment ===
The National Campus Climate Survey launched its service and website ([http://www.nationalcampusclimatesurvey.com www.nationalcampusclimatesurvey.com]) on September 1, 2015 and is currently enrolling institutions of higher education into the Spring 2016 data collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Assault Survey Now Available for Multi-Institutional Enrollment|url=http://www.nationalcampusclimatesurvey.org/news/2015/9/2/sexual-assault-survey-now-available-for-multi-institutional-enrollment|website=National Campus Climate Survey|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Study Design ===
The core NCCS design uses a sample survey approach rather than a [[census]] of all students. (However, schools will have the option to conduct a census if they wish.) A randomly selected sample of students (undergraduates and graduates) allows the study to make scientifically based inferences to the population as a whole, helps focus finite research resources on successfully contacting and encouraging the participation of the broadest group of students, and reduces survey burden on an often over-surveyed population.

The NCCS will request sample data from university registrars (i.e. gender, race/ethnicity, year in school, on/off campus residence) in addition to contact information to allow for nonresponse analyses to be conducted. If deemed appropriate, the NCCS may generate nonresponse bias weights for the final analytic data file.

The NCCS will be implemented as a web-based, mobile-optimized survey, to ensure the data collected is of highest quality. Logical branching and filters will be used to tailor the questionnaire appropriately for each individual. Data collection will include at least four email contacts, and may include mailed prenotification letters, telephone calls, and in-person visits (depending on the service level selected). Data will be collected between January and April, 2016.

=== Service Levels ===
The NCCS has a three-tiered service structure, designed to meet the specific needs of the local campus.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Tier 1:&lt;br&gt;Campus Climate Pro !! Tier 2:&lt;br&gt;Campus Climate Pro Methods !! Tier 3:&lt;br&gt;Campus Climate Pro Comprehensive
|-
| '''Response Rate Goal''' || Up to 30% || 10-20% higher than Tier 1 || Achieved 67% at U-M Spring 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Results of 2015 University of Michigan Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Misconduct|url=https://publicaffairs.vpcomm.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2015/04/Complete-survey-results.pdf|website=U-M Public Affairs &amp; Internal Communications|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| '''Scientific Sample Size''' || n=4,000 || n=3,000 || n=2,000
|}

More specifics regarding the Tier services are available on the [http://www.nationalcampusclimatesurvey.org/service-levels/ study website service levels page].

=== Survey Instrument ===
The survey instrument and methodology were designed by a team, led by the University of Michigan’s Survey Research Center and including representatives from Student Life at the University of Michigan, the Office of the General Counsel at the University of Michigan, and SoundRocket. The team designed the survey measurements to include both the prevalence and incidence of sexual assault on campus, as well as perceptions of campus climate. The methodological team drew heavily upon behavioral-specific questions from the Sexual Experiences Survey to measure the prevalence and incidence of sexual assault, because such questions have been researched and validated. (1) The design features of this survey have demonstrated effectiveness in minimizing response errors in web surveys, as well as minimizing overall respondent burden. (2) The average length for completion of the survey instrument is less than 15 minutes.  

An early draft of the survey instrument is available at the [https://publicaffairs.vpcomm.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2015/04/Campus-climate-survey-questions.pdf University of Michigan 2015 Campus Climate Surveys Regarding Sexual Misconduct] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8518">'''Opinion corridor''' ({{lang-sv|åsiktskorridor}}, {{lang-no|meningskorridor}}) refers to a sociopolitical phenomenon that has been observed during the beginning of the 21st century in [[Sweden]], and to some extent also in [[Norway]]. The expression itself was originally used in 2013 by {{Interlanguage link multi|Henrik Oscarsson|sv}}, professor in [[political science]] at the [[University of Gothenburg]], as a [[metaphor]] for the limits of what's commonly accepted to debate.&lt;ref name=sprakradet-se&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jande|first1=Per-Anders|last2=Svensson|first2=Anders|title=Från attefallshus till åsiktskorridor|url=http://www.sprakochfolkminnen.se/om-oss/nyheter-och-press/nyhetsarkiv/nyheter-2014/2014-12-29-fran-attefallshus-till-asiktskorridor.html|accessdate=20 December 2015|publisher=Språkrådet|agency=Institutet för språk och folkminnen|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nyord|url=http://www.sprakradet.no/Vi-og-vart/Publikasjoner/Spraaknytt/spraknytt-12015/nyord/|accessdate=20 December 2015|publisher=Språkrådet|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept is similar to the [[Overton window]], which assumes a sliding scale of legitimate political conversation, and to [[Hallin's spheres]], which assumes that the press implicitly groups issues into questions of wide consensus, legitimate controversy, and deviance. The [[Swedish Language Council]] has included the word ''åsiktskorridor'' in its 2014 list of [[neologism]]s.&lt;ref name=sprakradet-se/&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Background ===
In December 2013, political scientist {{Interlanguage link multi|Henrik Oscarsson|sv}} described how he perceived that the space for [[freedom of opinion]] had been tightened in Swedish debates.

* 14% of Swedes agree with limiting the rights to [[abortion]].

Oscarsson concluded with calling for "a more moderate and respectful attitude from policymakers".&lt;ref name=Oscarsson2013/&gt;

In February 2015, [[Expressen]] editor {{Interlanguage link multi|Ann-Charlotte Marteus|sv}} published an apology for being part of "constructing a corridor that prevented a constructive debate about migration and integration". She wrote that it was something that she started doing around 2002, when language tests were being debated and the [[Sweden Democrats]] started to become more influential. She was also afraid that Sweden's political climate would become more similar to that of [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name=Marteus&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marteus|first1=Ann-Charlotte|title=Det är jag som är åsiktskorridoren|url=http://www.expressen.se/ledare/ann-charlotte-marteus/det-ar-jag-som-ar-asiktskorridoren/|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher=[[Expressen]]|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text=Sweden didn't become like Denmark, thank goodness.

=== Other observations ===

Erik Helmersson from [[Dagens Nyheter]] wrote that Sweden has many opinion corridors in which people rarely question the norms within the group. He blames the Swedish "culture of consensus" and that the social cost for presenting an opposing view is too high. He also praises director Stina Oscarson for her new expression "test speech" and states that it's important to allow people to try new ways of thinking without being smothered by blame and insults.&lt;ref name=Helmerson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Helmerson|first1=Erik|title=Erik Helmerson: Vi ses i baren på åsiktshotellet|url=http://www.dn.se/ledare/signerat/erik-helmerson-vi-ses-i-baren-pa-asiktshotellet/|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|date=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistical research ==

During the first quarter of 2015, the statistical institute {{Interlanguage link multi|Demoskop|sv}} conducted a survey named "Who dares to speak about their opinions?" which had a sample size of 4348. They observed the following trends:&lt;ref name=Demoskop2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Santesson|first1=Peter|title=Vem vågar prata om sina åsikter?|url=http://www.demoskop.se/vem-vagar-prata/|accessdate=20 December 2015|publisher=Demoskop|date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Increased hesitation in debates with people outside the usual social circles
* People with left-wing ideologies speak more openly while those that identify themselves as nationally oriented or conservative feel that they have more limitations

== Criticism and denial ==

[[Sollentuna Municipality|Council]] politician Per Altenberg from the [[Liberals (Sweden)|Liberals]], while not addressing the research by professor Oscarsson, denied the existence of the opinion corridor and maintained that the corridor should not be discussed in his opinion piece entitled "There is no opinion corridor".&lt;ref name=Altenberg&gt;{{cite news|last1=Altenberg|first1=Per|title=Det finns inte någon åsiktskorridor|url=http://www.svd.se/det-finns-inte-nagon-asiktskorridor|accessdate=20 December 2015|publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|date=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text=Let's get rid of the opinion corridor and end this whole debate about that there are things that you can't say in Sweden.|author=Per Altenberg|source=[[Svenska Dagbladet]], 24 May 2015&lt;ref name=Altenberg/&gt;}}

Columnist Malin Ullgren from [[Dagens Nyheter]], while not addressing the research by professor Oscarsson, condemns the usage of the term, and describes it as a rhethorical device the [[far right]] uses to undermine the stability of society. She states that right-wing extremists have spent years on "systematic erosion of the limits of decency" to further their agendas and that the far right freely express their agendas.&lt;ref name="Ullgren"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ullgren|first1=Malin|title=Om det fanns en åsiktskorridor så är den nu grundligt riven|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/kronikor/malin-ullgren-om-det-fanns-en-asiktskorridor-sa-ar-den-nu-grundligt-riven/|accessdate=27 February 2016|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text=Contributing to delusions about opinion corridors or "cover-up of truth by the elite" is to actively undermine democracy.|author=Malin Ullgren|source=[[Dagens Nyheter]], 3 February 2016&lt;ref name="Ullgren"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2719">'''Oscar Clark Carr Jr.''' (? – November 5, 1977) was a civil rights activist and leading member of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|American Episcopal Church]].

== Biography ==
Oscar Carr was born in [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]]. He graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] and served as a naval officer for three years before returning home to his family cotton farm. Carr credited the "racial militancy" of Governor [[Ross Barnett]] of Mississippi and Governor [[George Wallace]] of Alabama for spurring his interest in civil rights. Working with state [[NAACP]] leader [[Aaron Henry]], he started an anti-poverty community action group in [[Coahoma County, Mississippi|Coahoma county]].&lt;ref name= newsservice/&gt; Together they also enrolled 6,000 children in the [[Head Start (program)|Head Start program]].&lt;ref name= livingchurch/&gt;

In 1968, he was co-director — with rights leader [[Charles Evers]] — of the Mississippi presidential campaign of Senator [[Robert Kennedy]].&lt;ref name= newsservice&gt;{{Citation| date = 9 November 1977| title = Church, Rights Leader Oscar Carr Dies| publisher = Episcopal News Service| url = http://episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/ENS/ENSpress_release.pl?pr_number=77364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year he was a key member of the Loyal Democrats of Mississippi delegation which successfully challenged the regular delegation from the state for their seats at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name="newsservice"/&gt;

In 1971, Carr became the Episcopal Church's first executive for stewardship and development.&lt;ref name= livingchurch/&gt;

He died of cancer on November 5, 1977 at age the age of 54.&lt;ref name= livingchurch&gt;{{cite magazine| date = 4 December 1977| title  = Oscarr Carr Dies| url  = https://books.google.com/books?id=X1zkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=Oscar+Clark+Carr+Jr.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iyImOxPnlt&amp;sig=c5-xIN1D5UV6xpiwrtJgqPu5qmE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiyqavqp6bQAhXSdSYKHcyOADI4ChDoAQg_MAo#v=onepage&amp;q=Oscar%20Clark%20Carr%20Jr.&amp;f=false | page = 6| magazine = [[The Living Church]]| publisher = The Living Church Foundation, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 500 people attended his funeral at the [[Church of the Heavenly Rest]] in New York City on 8 November, which was presided over by Bishop [[Paul Moore, Jr.|Paul Moore]].&lt;ref name="newsservice"/&gt;

'''Personhood''' is the status of being a [[person]]. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in [[philosophy]] and [[law]] and is closely tied with legal and [[political]] concepts of [[citizenship]], [[equality before the law|equality]], and [[liberty]]. According to law, only a [[natural person]] or [[legal personality]] has [[rights]], protections, privileges, responsibilities, and [[legal liability]].&lt;ref&gt;"Where it is more than simply a synonym for 'human being', 'person' figures primarily in moral and legal discourse. A person is a being with ''a certain moral status'', or a bearer of rights. But underlying the moral status, as its condition, are ''certain capacities''. A person is a being who has a sense of self, has a notion of the future and the past, can hold values, make choices; in short, can adopt life-plans. At least, a person must be the kind of being who is in principle capable of all this, however damaged these capacities may be in practice." Charles Taylor, "The Concept of a Person", ''Philosophical Papers. Volume 1.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985, 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Personhood continues to be a topic of international debate and has been questioned critically during the abolition of human and nonhuman [[slavery]], in theology, in debates about [[abortion]] and in [[fetal rights]] and/or [[reproductive rights]], in [[animal rights]] activism, in [[theology]] and [[ontology]], in [[ethics|ethical theory]], and in debates about [[corporate personhood]] and the [[beginning of human personhood]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html "Justices, 5–4, Reject Corporate Spending Limit"], ''The New York Times'', January 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Processes through which personhood is recognized socially and legally vary cross-culturally, demonstrating that notions of personhood are not universal. Anthropologist Beth Conklin has shown how personhood is tied to social relations among the [[Wari' people]] of [[Rondônia]], Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Beth A. Conklin and Lynn M. Morgan, "Babies, Bodies, and the Production of Personhood in North America and a Native Amazonian Society," 'Ethos,' Vol. 24, No. 4 (Dec., 1996), pp. 657–694.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Knauft's studies of the Gebusi people of Papua New Guinea depict a context in which individuals become persons incrementally, again through social relations.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Knauft, 'The Gebusi: Lives Transformed in a Rainforest World, 3e" New York: McGraw-Hill, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Jane C. Goodale]] has also examined the construction of personhood in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Goodale, 'To Sing With Pigs Is Human: The Concept of Person in Papua New Guinea,' Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{cleanup|section|reason=Various concepts of personhood are listed in no particular order with no overarching structure or organization|date=June 2012}}
Capacities or attributes common to definitions of personhood can include [[human nature]], [[agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[self-awareness]], a notion of the past and future, and the possession of [[rights]] and [[duties]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor, "The Concept of a Person", ''Philosophical Papers. Volume 1.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985, 97–114.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concept of a person is difficult to define in a way that is universally accepted, due to its historical and cultural variability and the controversies surrounding its use in some contexts.

===Western philosophy&lt;!--linked from 'Functionalism (philosophy of mind)'--&gt;===
In philosophy, the word "person" may refer to various concepts. According to the "naturalist" [[epistemology|epistemological]] tradition, from [[Descartes]] through [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[David Hume|Hume]], the term may designate any human (or [[Non human|non-human]]) [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] who: (1) possesses continuous [[consciousness]] over time; and (2) who is therefore capable of framing representations about the world, formulating plans and acting on them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], "The Concept of a Person", Philosophical Papers. Volume 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985, 97–114&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], the problem with the naturalist view is that it depends solely on a "performance criterion" to determine what is an agent. Thus, other things (e.g. machines or animals) that exhibit "similarly complex adaptive behaviour" could not be distinguished from persons. Instead, Taylor proposes a significance-based view of personhood:

{{quote|What is crucial about agents is that things matter to them. We thus cannot simply identify agents by a performance criterion, nor assimilate animals to machines... [likewise] there are matters of significance for human beings which are peculiarly human, and have no analogue with animals.|&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], "The Concept of a Person", Philosophical Papers. Volume 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985, 98–102&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others, such as American Philosopher [[Francis J. Beckwith]], argue that personhood is not linked to function at all, but rather that it is the underlying personal unity of the individual.

{{quote|What is crucial morally is the being of a person, not his or her functioning.  A human person does not come into existence when human function arises, but rather, a human person is an [[entity]] who has the natural inherent capacity to give rise to human functions, whether or not those functions are ever attained.  …A human person who lacks the ability to think [[Rationality|rationally]] (either because she is too young or she suffers from a disability) is still a human person because of her nature.  Consequently, it makes sense to speak of a human being’s lack if and only if she is an actual person.|2=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beckwith|first=Francis J.|title=Abortion, Bioethics, and Personhood: A Philosophical Reflection|url=http://www.personhoodkansas.com/files/Keith%20Ashley/AbortionBioethicsandPersonhood.pdf|publisher=The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philosopher [[J. P. Moreland]] clarifies this point:

{{quote|It is because an entity has an essence and falls within a natural kind that it can possess a unity of dispositions, capacities, parts and properties at a given time and can maintain identity through change.|2=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moreland|first=J. P.|title=James Rachels and the Active Euthanasia Debate|journal=Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society|year=1988|volume=31|pages=86|url=http://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/31/31-1/31-1-pp081-090_JETS.pdf|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Harry G. Frankfurt]] writes that, "What philosophers have lately come to accept as analysis of the concept of a person is not actually analysis of ''that'' concept at all." He suggests that the concept of a person is intimately connected to [[free will]], and describes the structure of human [[volition (psychology)|volition]] according to first- and second-order desires:

{{quote|Besides wanting and choosing and being moved ''to do'' this or that, [humans] may also want to have (or not to have) certain desires and motives. They are capable of wanting to be different, in their preferences and purposes, from what they are. Many animals appear to have the capacity for what I shall call "first-order desires" or "desires of the first order," which are simply desires to do or not to do one thing or another. No animal other than man, however, appears to have the capacity for reflective self-evaluation that is manifested in the formation of second-order desires.|&lt;ref&gt;Harry G. Frankfurt, "Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 68, No.1 (Jan 14, 1971), 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;P.G Ossorio, The Behavior Of Persons, Ann Arbor: Descriptive Psychology Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The criteria for being a person... are designed to capture those attributes which are the subject of our most humane concern with ourselves and the source of what we regard as most important and most problematical in our lives.|Harry G. Frankfurt}}{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

According to [[Nikolas Kompridis]], there might also be an [[intersubjectivity|intersubjective]], or interpersonal, basis to personhood:

{{quote|What if personal identity is constituted in, and sustained through, our relations with others, such that were we to erase our relations with our significant others we would also erase the conditions of our self-intelligibility? As it turns out, this erasure... is precisely what is experimentally dramatized in the “science fiction” film, ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'', a far more philosophically sophisticated meditation on personal identity than is found in most of the contemporary literature on the topic.|&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, [http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia08/parrhesia08_kompridis.pdf "Technology's Challenge to Democracy: What of the Human?", ''Parrhesia'' 8 (2009)], 27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other philosophers have defined persons in different ways. [[Boethius]] gives the definition of "person" as "an individual substance of a rational nature" ("''Naturæ rationalis individua substantia''").&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Geddes|first=Leonard|title=Person|encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|location=New York|year=1911|volume=11|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm|accessdate=2011-03-09|quote=The Latin word persona was originally used to denote the mask worn by an actor. From this it was applied to the role he assumed, and, finally, to any character on the stage of life, to any individual.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Midgley defines a “person” as being a conscious, thinking being, which knows that it is a person ([[self-awareness]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/midgley01.htm "Persons and non-persons"], in Peter Singer (ed), ''In Defense of Animals''. Basil Blackwell, 1985, pp. 52–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Thomas I. White argues that the criteria for a person are as follows: (1) is alive, (2) is aware, (3) feels positive and negative sensations, (4) has emotions, (5) has a sense of self, (6) controls its own behaviour, (7) recognises other persons and treats them appropriately, and (8) has a variety of sophisticated cognitive abilities. While many of White's criteria are somewhat [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]], some animals such as [[dolphin]]s would still be considered persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophypress.co.uk/?p=1279 |title=Dolphin people |author=Thomas I. White |date=June 2, 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some animal rights groups have also championed recognition for animals as "persons".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordanimalethics.com/2010/01/fellow-champions-dolphins-as-%E2%80%9Cnon-human-persons%E2%80%9D/ Fellow Champions Dolphins as “Non-Human Persons”], Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics, January 10, 2010; Midgley, Mary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach to personhood, Paradigm Case Formulation, used in [[Descriptive psychology|Descriptive Psychology]] and developed by [[Peter Ossorio]], involves the four interrelated concepts of 1) The Individual Person, 2) Deliberate Action, 3) Reality and the Real World, and 4) Language or Verbal Behavior.  All four concepts require full articulation for any one of them to be fully intelligible. More specifically,  a Person is an individual whose history is, paradigmatically, a history of Deliberate Action in a Dramaturgical pattern. Deliberate Action is a form of behavior in which a person (a) engages in an Intentional Action, (b) is cognizant of that, and (c) has chosen to do that.  A person is not always engaged in a deliberate action but has the eligibility to do so.  A human being is an individual who is both a person and a specimen of Homo sapiens. Since persons are deliberate actors, they also employ hedonic, prudent, aesthetic and ethical reasons when selecting, choosing or deciding on a course of action. As part of our "social contract" we expect that the typical person can make use of all four of these motivational perspectives. Individual persons will weigh these motives in a manner that reflects their personal characteristics.  That life is lived in a “dramaturgical” pattern is to say that people make sense, that their lives have patterns of significance. The paradigm case allows for nonhuman persons, potential persons, nascent persons, manufactured persons, former persons, "deficit case" persons, and "primitive" persons. By using a paradigm case methodology, different observers can point to where they agree and where they disagree about whether an entity qualifies as a person.&lt;ref&gt;P. G. Ossorio, ''The Behavior of Persons'', Ann Arbor: Descriptive Psychology Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Schwartz, Wynn. (1982) The Problem of Other Possible Persons: Dolphins, Primates, and Aliens. in, Advances in Descriptive Psychology, vol 2, (eds: Davis &amp; Mitchel), Greenwich, CT: JAI Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===American law===
{{see also|US person}}
A person is recognized by law as such, not because they are human, but because rights and duties are ascribed to them. The person is the legal subject or substance of which the rights and duties are attributes. An individual human being considered to be having such attributes is what lawyers call a "natural person."&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, First Book of Jurispr. 110. Gray, Nature and Sources of Law, ch. II. Black's Law Dictionary, 4th Edition, p 1300&lt;/ref&gt; According to Black's Law Dictionary,&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, 5th edition, citing the National Labor Relations Act, section 2(1)&lt;/ref&gt; a person is:

{{quote|In general usage, a human being (i.e. [[natural person]]), though by statute term may include a firm, labor organizations, partnerships, associations, corporations, legal representatives, trustees, trustees in bankruptcy, or receivers.}}

In Federal law, the concept of legal personhood is formalized by statute (1 [[United_States_Code|USC]] §8) as a "member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development."

As an application of [[social psychology]] and other disciplines, phenomena such as the ''perception'' and ''attribution'' of personhood have been scientifically studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Person Perception. Second Edition |author=Schneider, Hastdorf, and Ellsworth |year=1979 |publisher=Addison Wesley |ISBN= 0-201-06768-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jls.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/10/2/99 |title=Second-Language Fluency and Person Perception in China and the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical questions addressed in social psychology are the accuracy of attribution, processes of perception and the formation of bias. Various other scientific/medical disciplines address the myriad of issues in the development of [[Personality psychology|personality]].

==Debates==

Various specific debates focus on questions about the personhood of different classes of entities.

===Humans===

====Beginning of personhood====
{{for|full article|Beginning of human personhood}}

The [[beginning of human personhood]] is a concept long debated by religion and philosophy.  With respect to [[abortion]], 'personhood' is the status of a human being having individual human rights. The term was used by Justice Blackmun in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.&lt;ref name="ROE V. WADE, 410 U. S. 113 1973"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/410/113/case.html |title=ROE V.

A political movement in the United States seeks to define the [[beginning of human personhood]] as starting from the moment of [[fertilisation|fertilization]] with the result being that abortion, as well as forms of birth control that act to deprive the human embryo of necessary sustenance in [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]], could become illegal.&lt;ref name="Huffpo-Bassett-2011-11-08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/08/personhood-abortion-bans-_n_1082344.html|title='Personhood' Anti-Abortion Movement Gains National Momentum|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=2011-11-09|date=2011-11-08|author=Laura Bassett}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.wustl.edu/news/Pages/22935.aspx|title=Numerous flaws in ‘personhood’ movement, says family law expert|date=November 7, 2011|publisher=Washington University in St. Louis|accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the movement also state that it would have some effect on the practice of [[in-vitro fertilisation|in-vitro fertilization]] (IVF), but would not lead to the practice being outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will Mississippi Ban IVF?|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/10/24/personhood-ballot-initiative-in-mississippi-could-ban-some-ivf-practices.html|publisher=The Daily Beast|date=October 24, 2011|author=Michelle Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan F.

A representative organization within this movement is Personhood USA, a [[Colorado]]-based [[umbrella group]] with a number of state-level affiliates,&lt;ref name="Bloomberg-Deprez-2011-11-04"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-04/toughest-u-s-abortion-law-nears-passage-in-mississippi-vote.html|title=Toughest U.S. Abortion Law Nears Passage in Mississippi Vote|author=Esmé E.

Proponents of the movement regard personhood as an attempt to directly challenge the ''Roe v. Wade'' [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision, thus filling a legal void left by [[Harry Blackmun|Justice Harry Blackmun]] in the majority opinion when he wrote: “If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant’s case, of course, collapses, for the fetus’ right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment.”&lt;ref name="ROE V. WADE, 410 U. S. 113 1973" /&gt;

Some medical organizations have described the potential effects of personhood legislation as potentially harmful to patients and the practice of medicine, particularly in the cases of [[ectopic pregnancy|ectopic]] and [[molar pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57318625-503544/doctors-call-mississippi-personhood-initiative-dangerous/|title=Doctors call Mississippi "personhood" initiative dangerous|author=Rob Mank|publisher=CBS News|date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan Bordo]] has suggested that the focus on the issue of personhood in abortion debates has often been a means for depriving women of their rights. She writes that "the legal double standard concerning the bodily integrity of pregnant and nonpregnant bodies, the construction of women as fetal incubators, the bestowal of 'super-subject' status to the fetus, and the emergence of a father's-rights ideology" demonstrate "that the current terms of the abortion debate – as a contest between fetal claims to personhood and women's right to choose – are limited and misleading."&lt;ref&gt;Susan Bordo, "Are Mothers Persons?", ''Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body'', Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 2003, 71–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Colleen Carroll Campbell, say that the personhood movement is a natural progression of society in protecting the equal rights of all members of the human species.  She writes, “The basic philosophical premise behind these [personhood] amendments is eminently reasonable. And the alternative on offer – which severs humanity from personhood – is fraught with peril. If being human is not enough to entitle one to [[human rights]], then the very concept of human rights loses meaning. And all of us — born and unborn, strong and weak, young and old — someday will find ourselves on the wrong end of that cruel measuring stick."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Colleen Carroll|title=Personhood begins when life begins|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-faith/post/personhood-begins-when-life-begins/2011/11/02/gIQARCXwgM_blog.html|accessdate=23 May 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Pavone|Father Frank Pavone]] agrees, adding, “Nor is this a dispute about the state imposing a religious or philosophical view. After all, your life and mine are not protected because of some religious or philosophical belief that others are required to have about us. More accurately, the law protects us precisely in spite of the beliefs of others who, in their own [[World view|worldview]], may not value our lives. …To support Roe vs. Wade is not merely to allow a medical procedure. It is to acknowledge that the government has the power to say who is a person and who is not. Who, then, is to limit the groups to whom it is applied? This is what makes “personhood” such an important public policy issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pavone|first=Fr.

The [[Roman Catholic Church|Vatican]] has recently been advancing a human [[Human exceptionalism|exceptionalist]] understanding of personhood theory. Catechism 2270 reads: “Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person—among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 5, The Fifth Commandment|url=http://old.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art5.shtml|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United States=====

In March 2007 Georgia became the first state in the nation to introduce a legislative resolution to amend the state constitution to define and recognize the personhood of the pre-born.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/en-US/display/20072008/HR/536&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgia Catholic Conference and National Right to Life supported the effort and it failed to attract a [[Supermajority|super majority]] in both chambers in order to be placed on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifeissues.net/writers/bru/bru_48mississippi.html&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia legislators have filed a personhood resolution every session since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20092010/SR/328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20112012/SR/153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20132014/SR/420&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008 Georgia Right to Life hosted the first nationwide Personhood Symposium targeting pro-life activists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joniandfriends.org/help-and-resources/other-resources/personhood/&lt;/ref&gt; This symposium was instrumental in spawning the group Personhood USA and the various state personhood efforts that followed. Voters in 46 [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties approved personhood during the 2010 primary election with 75% in favor of a non-binding resolution declaring the equal rights of all human beings from conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Becker|first=Daniel|title=Georgia Voters Say 'YES' to Personhood Amendment|url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/391914486.html|publisher=ChristianNewsWire|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2012 Republican primary a similar question was placed on the ballot statewide and passed with a super-majority (66%) of the vote in 158 of 159 counties.&lt;ref&gt;http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/40378/95366/en/vts.html?cid=93510&lt;/ref&gt;

The summer of 2008 a citizen initiated amendment was proposed for the Colorado constitution.&lt;ref&gt;http://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Definition_of_Person_Initiative,_Amendment_48_%282008%29&lt;/ref&gt; Three attempts to enact the from-fertilization definition of personhood into [[State constitution (United States)|U.S. state constitutions]] via [[referenda]] have failed.&lt;ref name="BBC-9-Nov-2011" /&gt; Following two attempts to enact similar changes in [[Colorado]] in 2008 and [[Colorado Amendment 62 (2010)|2010]], a 2011 initiative to amend the state constitution  by referendum in the state of [[Mississippi]] also failed to gain approval with around 58% of voters disapproving.&lt;ref name="BBC-9-Nov-2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15642138|title=Mississippi voters reject life at conception amendment|publisher=BBC|date=9 November 2011|accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/anti-abortion-personhood-amendment-fails-in-mississippi/2011/11/08/gIQASRPd3M_blog.html|title=Anti-abortion ‘personhood’ amendment fails in Mississippi|author=Aaron Blake|date=2011-11-08|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview after the referendum, Mason ascribed the failure of the initiative to a political campaign run by [[Planned Parenthood]].&lt;ref name="Huffpo-Bassett-2011-11-00"&gt;{{cite web|title=Personhood USA Blames Planned Parenthood For Loss in Mississippi|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/09/mississippis-failed-perso_n_1083960.html|author=Laura Bassett|publisher=Huffington Post|date=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personhood proponents in Oklahoma sought to amend the state constitution to define personhood as beginning at conception. The state Supreme Court, citing the U.S. Supreme Court's 1992 decision in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', ruled in April 2012 that the proposed amendment was unconstitutional under the federal Constitution and blocked inclusion of the referendum question on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krehbiel|first=Randy|title=Group requests personhood appeal from U.S. Supreme Court|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/site/printerfriendlystory.aspx?articleid=20120731_16_A9_Clrdae519381|newspaper=TulsaWorld|date=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the state Supreme Court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoberbrock|first=Barbara|title=U.S. Supreme Court declines to review Oklahoma personhood decision|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=336&amp;articleid=20121030_16_A1_OLHMIY34169|newspaper=TulsaWorld|date=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a 16-year-old girl was charged in Mississippi with murder for the still-birth of her daughter on the basis that the girl had smoked cocaine while pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;ProPublica, 18 March 2014: [https://www.propublica.org/article/stillborn-child-charge-of-murder-and-disputed-case-law-on-fetal-harm A Stillborn Child, A Charge of Murder and the Disputed Case Law on ‘Fetal Harm’]&lt;/ref&gt; These charges were later dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;The Dispatch, 3 April 2014: [http://www.cdispatch.com/news/article.asp?aid=32344 Judge dismisses Rennie Gibbs' depraved heart murder case]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====International=====

In 1983, the people of Ireland added the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eighth Amendment]] to their constitution that “acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.”

====Women====

In 1920, with the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], women became protected against discrimination in their right to vote in the United States.  In 1971, the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Reed v. Reed]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofsupremecourt.org/resources/lp_gender_reedvreed.htm Equal Protection for Women]&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]] applies to [[women]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/supreme-court-drama/reed-v-reed Reed v. Reed]&lt;/ref&gt; as they are "persons" according to the US Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratical.org/corporations/ToPRaP.html Timeline of Personhood]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] argued that women do not have equal protection under the 14th amendment as "persons"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/03/scalia-women-discrimination-constitution_n_803813.html Scalia: Women Don't Have Constitutional Protection Against Discrimination]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2020667,00.html Time]&lt;/ref&gt;
saying that the Constitution's use of the gender-neutral term "Person" means that the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex, but also does not prohibit such discrimination; he said "Nobody ever thought that that's what it meant. Nobody ever voted for that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carolyn-maloney/lets-put-it-in-writing-wo_b_874759.html Let's Put It in Writing: Women Are Equal]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many others, including law professor [[Jack Balkin]] disagree with this assertion.  Balkin states that, at a minimum "the fourteenth amendment was intended to prohibit some forms of sex discrimination-- discrimination in basic civil rights against single women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Balkin|first=Jack|title=Scalia on Sex Equality|url=http://balkin.blogspot.com/2011/01/scalia-on-sex-equality.html|accessdate=27 September 2012|date=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many local marriage laws at the time the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was ratified (as well as when the original Constitution was ratified) had concepts of coverture and "head-and-master", which meant that women legally lost rights, including rights to ownership of property and other rights of adult participation in the political economy upon marriage; single women retained these rights, however, and voted in some jurisdictions.  Also, other commentators have noted that some people who ratified the Constitution in 1787 in other contemporaneous contexts ratified state level Constitutions that saw women as Persons, required to be treated as such, including in rights such as voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitution of New Jersey, 1776.|year=1776|publisher=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Jersey Women's History|url=http://www.njwomenshistory.org/index.htm|publisher=Alice Paul Institute|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 17th and 18th Century Quaker concept of Personhood most certainly applied to women and the prevalence of Quakers in the population of several colonies, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania at the time the original Constitution was drafted and ratified likely influenced the use of the term "Person" in the Constitution rather than the term "Man" used in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and in the contemporaneously drafted [[French Constitution of 1791]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calvert|first=Jane|title=Quaker Constitutionalism and the Political Thought of John Dickinson|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88436-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of personhood beginning at conception gives issues to women. Daniel Fincke states "Applying the logic to abortion she argues that an involuntarily pregnant woman has the right to refuse to let her body be used by the fetus even were we to reason that the fetus has a right to life."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2014/06/moral-and-philosophical-arguments-against-fetal-personhood/&lt;/ref&gt; The personhood movement may cause many more issues that just a women's right to choose. Some fetal homicide laws have caused women to be sentenced to jail time for suspected drug use during her pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage, like the Alabama women who was sentenced to ten years for her suspected drug use.&lt;ref&gt;https://newrepublic.com/article/politics/94470/personhood-abortion-mississippi-roe-wade&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slaves====

[[File:Am I not a man.jpg|150px|thumb|''Am I not a man'' [[emblem]] used during the campaign to abolish [[slavery]]]]
In 1772, [[Somersett's Case]] determined that [[slavery]] was unsupported by law in [[England and Wales]], but not elsewhere in the [[British Empire]]. In 1868, under the 14th Amendment, [[black men]] in the United States became citizens. In 1870, under the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]], black men got the right to vote.

In 1853, [[Sojourner Truth]] became famous for asking ''[[Ain't I a Woman?]]'' and after slavery was abolished, black men continued to fight for personhood by claiming, ''[[I Am A Man!]]''

====Children====

The legal definition of persons may include or exclude children depending on the context.  In the US, regarding liability, children or minors are not legally persons because they do not satisfy the requirements for personhood under the law.&lt;ref name=duhaime&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duhaime|first1=Lloyd|title=Person Definition, duhaime.org, Learn Law|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/P/Person.aspx|website=duhaime.org|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, regarding protection under the law, the US [[Born-Alive Infants Protection Act]] of 2002 provides a legal structure that those born at any gestational stage that are either breathing,  have heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsation, or any voluntary muscle movement are living, individual human persons.&lt;ref Pub.L. 107-207, 116 Stat. 926, enacted August 5, 2002&gt;http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_reports&amp;docid=f:hr186.107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-human animals===
{{See also|Great ape personhood}}
Some philosophers and those involved in animal welfare, [[ethology]], [[animal rights|the rights of animals]], and related subjects, consider that certain animals should also be considered to be persons and thus granted legal personhood. Commonly named species in this context include the [[great ape]]s, [[cetacean]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news181981904.html |title=Scientists say dolphins should be treated as non-human persons |publisher=Physorg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[elephant]]s, because of their apparent intelligence and intricate social rules. The idea of extending personhood to all animals has the support of legal scholars such as [[Alan Dershowitz]]&lt;ref name="DershowitzAA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dershowitz |first=Alan |title=Rights from Wrongs: A Secular Theory of the Origins of Rights |year=2004 |pages= 198–99 }}  and {{cite book |author=Darwin, Meet Dershowitz |title=The Animals' Advocate |date= Winter 2002 |volume= 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Laurence Tribe]] of [[Harvard Law School]],&lt;ref name="AAMC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aamc.org/newsroom/reporter/oct03/animalrights.htm |title=Personhood Redefined: Animal Rights Strategy Gets at the Essence of Being Human |publisher= Association of American Medical Colleges |accessdate= July 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[animal law]] courses are now{{when|date=June 2014}} taught in 92 out of 180 law schools in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aldf.org/content/index.php?pid=83 |title=Animal law courses |publisher=[[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306074941/http://www.aldf.org/content/index.php?pid=83 |archivedate=2008-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 2008, [[Columbia University Press]] published [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cup/catalog/data/978023113/9780231139502.HTM Animals as Persons: Essays on the Abolition of Animal Exploitation] by Professor [[Gary L.

Some{{who|date=April 2014}} proponents of [[human exceptionalism]] (also referred to by its critics as [[speciesism]] or human supremacism&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Culture: The Ecological Crisis of Reason
By Val Plumwood&lt;/ref&gt;) have countered that we must institute a strict demarcation of personhood based on species membership in order to avoid the horrors of [[genocide]] (based on propaganda dehumanizing one or more ethnicities) or the injustices of [[forced sterilization]] (as occurred in many countries to people with low I.Q. scores and prisoners).{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Other theorists attempt to demarcate between degrees of personhood. For example, [[Peter Singer]]'s two-tiered account distinguishes between basic sentience and the higher standard of self-consciousness which constitutes personhood.  [[Wynn Schwartz]] has offered a Paradigm Case Formulation of Persons as a format allowing judges to identify qualities of personhood in different entities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Schwartz, W, 2013  "The Problem of other possible persons" http://freedomliberationreaction.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-problem-of-other-possible-persons.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Julian Friedland has advanced a seven-tiered account based on cognitive capacity and linguistic mastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedland|first=Julian|title=MINDS THAT MATTER: SEVEN DEGREES OF MORAL STANDING|url=http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1047&amp;context=bts|work=[[Between the Species]]|publisher=Cal Poly|volume=13|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amanda Stoel suggested that rights should be granted based on a scale of degrees of personhood, allowing entities currently denied any right to be recognized some rights, but not as many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stoel|first=Amanda|title=THE MEME OF ALTRUISM AND DEGREES OF PERSONHOOD|url=http://www.terasemjournals.com/PCJournal/PC0701/Papers/Stoel.pdf|work=Journal of Personal Cyberconsciousness|publisher=Terasem Movement, Inc.|page=35|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, India's Ministry of Forests and Environment banned the importation or capture of cetaceans (whales and dolphins) for entertainment, exhibition, or interaction purposes, on the basis that "cetaceans in general are highly intelligent and sensitive" and that it "is morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment." It noted that "various scientists" have argued they should be seen as "non-human persons" with commensurate rights, but did not take an official position on this, and indeed did not have the legal authority to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Ministry of Forests and Environment, Circular F.

In 2014, a hybrid, zoo-born orangutan named [[Sandra (orangutan)|Sandra]] was termed by the court in Argentina as a "non-human subject" in an unsuccessful habeas corpus case regarding the release of the orangutan from captivity at the Buenos Aires zoo. The status of the orangutan as a "non-human subject" needs to be clarified by the court. Court cases relevant to this orangutan are continuing in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;For corporations, see [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html "Justices, 5–4, Reject Corporate Spending Limit"], ''Reuters'', December 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, for the first time, two chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, were thought to be "legal persons," having been granted a writ of [[habeas corpus]]. This meant their detainer, [[Stony Brook University]], had to provide a legally sufficient reason for their imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/2015/04/20/judge-recognizes-two-chimpanzees-as-legal-persons-grants-them-writ-of-habeas-corpus|title=First Time in World History Judge Recognizes Two Chimpanzees as Legal Persons, Grants them Writ of Habeas Corpus |accessdate=2015-04-20 |date=2015-04-20 |publisher=Nonhuman Rights Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was rejected and the writ was reversed by the officiating judge shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2015/04/21/judge-reverses-human-rights-status-for-chimpanzees/|title=Judge reverses 'human rights' status for chimpanzees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypothetical beings===

Speculatively, there are several other likely categories of beings where personhood is at issue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Aliens====

If [[alien life]] were found to exist, under what circumstances would they be counted as "persons"? Do we have to consider any "willing and communicative (capable to register its own will) autonomous body" in the universe, no matter the species, an individual (a person)? Do they deserve equal rights with the human race?

====Artificial intelligence or life====

If [[artificial intelligence]]s, intelligent and self-aware system of hardware and software, are eventually created, what criteria would determine their personhood? Likewise, at what point would human-created biological life achieve personhood?

====Modified humans====

The theoretical landscape of personhood theory has been altered recently by controversy in the bioethics community concerning an emerging community of scholars, researchers, and activists identifying with an explicitly [[transhumanist]] position, which supports [[morphological freedom]], even if a person changed so much as to no longer be considered a member of the human [[species]]. For example, how much of a human can be [[prosthetics|artificially]] replaced before one loses their personhood? If people are considered persons because of their [[brain]], then what if the brain's thought patterns, memories and other attributes could be transposed into a device? Would the patient still be considered a person after the operation?

===Corporations===

{{Main article|Corporate personhood}}
Today, in statutory and corporate [[law]], certain [[social construct]]s are legally considered persons. In many jurisdictions, some [[corporation]]s and other [[Legal person|legal entities]] are considered [[legal person]]s with standing to sue or be sued in court. This is known as legal or [[corporate personhood]].

In 1819, the US Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]'', that corporations have the same rights as natural persons to enforce contracts.

===Environmental entities===
====Bolivia====
In 2006, Bolivia passed a law recognizing the rights of nature "to not be affected by mega-infrastructure and development projects that affect the balance of ecosystems and the local inhabitant communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/10/bolivia-enshrines-natural-worlds-rights|title=
Sunday 10 April 2011  |work=The Guardian|last=Vidal|first=John |date=
10 April 2011 |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Ecuador====
{{Main|Sumac Kawsay}}
In 2008, Ecuador approved a constitution to recognize that nature "...has the right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles, structure, functions and its processes in evolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therightsofnature.org/ecuador-rights/ |title=Ecuador Adopts Rights of Nature in Constitution |work=Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature|last= |first= |date= |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====New Zealand====
The [[Whanganui River]] of New Zealand is revered by the local [[Māori people]] as ''Te Awa Tupua'', sometimes translated as "an integrated, living whole".  Efforts to grant it special legal protection have been pursued by the Whanganui [[iwi]] since the 1870s.  In 2012, an agreement to grant legal personhood to the river was signed between the New Zealand government and the Whanganui River Māori Trust.  One guardian from the [[Monarchy of New Zealand|Crown]] and one from the Whanganui are responsible for protecting the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10830586 |title=Agreement entitles Whanganui River to legal identity |work=The New Zealand Herald |last=Shuttleworth |first=Kate |date=Aug 30, 2012 |accessdate=Jan 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====India====
In 2017,  court in the northern Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]] recognized the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] as legal persons. The judges cited Whanganui river in New Zealand as precedent for the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/ganges-and-yamuna-rivers-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-beings|title=Ganges and Yamuna rivers granted same legal rights as human beings |work=The Guardian|last=Safi|first=Michael |date=|accessdate=Jan 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

{{Refimprove section|date=January 2011}}

In [[animism|animistic]] religion, animals, plants, and other entities may be persons or [[deity|deities]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Christianity===

Christianity is the first philosophical system to use the word "person" in its modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;Met. John Zizioulas, ''Being As Communion: Studies in Personhood and the Church''. Crestwood: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1997, pp. 27–49&lt;/ref&gt; The word "''persona''" was transformed from its theater use into a term with strict technical theological meaning by [[Tertullian]] in his work, ''Adversus Praxean'' ("Against Praxeas"), in order to distinguish the three "persons" of the [[Trinity]]. Subsequently, [[Boethius]] refined the word to mean "an individual substance of a rational nature." This can be re-stated as "that which possesses an intellect and a will." Thus, the word "person" was originally a theological term created and defined by Christians to explain Christian theological concepts.

{{quote|The definition of Boethius as it stands can hardly be considered a satisfactory one. The words taken literally can be applied to the rational soul of man, and also the human nature of Christ. That St. Thomas accepts it is presumably due to the fact that he found it in possession, and recognized as the traditional definition. He explains it in terms that practically constitute a new definition. ''Individua substantia'' signifies, he says, ''substantia, completa, per se subsistens, separata ab aliia'', i.e., a substance, complete, subsisting per se, existing apart from others (III, Q. xvi, a. 12, ''ad 2um'').

If to this be added ''rationalis naturae'', we have a definition comprising the five notes that go to make up a person: (a) ''substantia''-- this excludes accident; (b) ''completa''-- it must form a complete nature; that which is a part, either actually or "aptitudinally" does not satisfy the definition; (c) ''per se subsistens''--the person exists in itself and for itself; he or she is ''sui juris'', the ultimate possessor of his or her nature and all its acts, the ultimate subject of predication of all his or her attributes; that which exists in another is not a person; (d) ''separata ab aliis''--this excludes the universal, ''substantia secunda'', which has no existence apart from the individual; (e) ''rationalis naturae''--excludes all non-intellectual ''supposita''.

To a person therefore belongs a threefold incommunicability, expressed in notes (b), (c), and (d). The human soul belongs to the nature as a part of it, and is therefore not a person, even when existing separately.|''Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1913|Person}}

'''PONTIFEX''' (Planning Of Non-specific Transportation by an Intelligent Fleet EXpert) was a mid-1980s project that introduced a novel approach to complex aircraft fleet scheduling,&lt;ref&gt;P. Mertens, V. Borkowski, W. Geis, ''Betriebliche Expertensystem-Anwendungen'', Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1993, p.352&lt;/ref&gt; partially funded by the [[European Commission]]'s Strategic Programme for R&amp;D in Information Technology.&lt;ref&gt;M. Cini, [[Paolo Magrassi|P. Magrassi]], "Results and progress of project 2111 Pontifex", European Strategic Programme for R&amp;D in Information Technology, Office and business systems, European Commission DGXIII, Brussels, Belgium, November 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mathematical problems stemming from nontrivial fleet scheduling easily become computationally unsolvable, the PONTIFEX idea consisted in a seamless merge of [[algorithms]] and [[heuristic]] knowledge embedded in rules.&lt;ref&gt;M.Cini, P. Magrassi, "Pontifex: A Knowledge-Based DSS For Routing And Scheduling Problems", Quaderni dell'Istituto per l'Analisi dei Sistemi e l'lnformatica, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Roma, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.Cini, P. Magrassi, "A Knowledge-Based Decision Support System For Routing And Scheduling", Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference On Expert Systems And The Leading Edge In Production And Operations Management, Hilton Head Island, SC, USA, Karwan Sweigart Publishers, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The system, based on domain knowledge collected from airliners [[Alitalia]], [[KLM]], [[Swissair]], and [[TAP Portugal]], was first adopted by Swissair and Alitalia in the late 1980s, then also by the Italian railroad national operator, for their cargo division. It is still in use today (2008).

'''Robert The''' is a [[New York City]] artist known for his Gun Books and other sculptures made primarily of books.

== Career ==

The's work has been exhibited in notable museums in the US and internationally. According to the [[Chicago Reader]], ''"The is reluctant to betray his trade secrets, saying only that he uses a power saw. Paper is harder to cut than wood', he says"''. Each year ''"he cranks out hundreds of pieces--every one is different"''.  The's book guns have been collected, writes the Chicago Reader, in the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in [[Los Angeles]], and the [[Walker Art Center]] in [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name=ChicagoReader&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/on-exhibitloaded-words/Content?oid=893423 | title=Chicago Reader | publisher=chicagoreader.com | work=On Exhibit:loaded words | date=May 15, 1997 | accessdate=November 14, 2011 | author=huebner, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

The [[New York Times]], discussing the future of physical books, wrote that "creative uses for books that do not involve engaging with words on a page already abound", and instances The's books cut "into gun shapes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/magazine/08fob-consumed-t.html?scp=1&amp;sq=%22Robert%20The%22%20gun%20book&amp;st=cse | title=New York Times | publisher=nytimes.com | work=Creative New Uses for Books | date=August 6, 2010 | accessdate=November 14, 2011 | author=Walker, Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Chicago Reader, The "owns up to [the book guns'] sensational aspect", and says he "still gets complaints", the majority (in The's words) "from leftists".&lt;ref name=ChicagoReader /&gt;

GreenMuze writes that "Bookguns by American artist Robert The, are used books that are artfully cut into gun-like shapes. Each book is carefully selected to create a play-on-words or add an ironic dimension to his recycled artwork." Book titles include Salinger's [[Catcher in the Rye]], McLuhan's [[The Medium is the Massage]] and the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenmuze.com/art/artists/3366-recycled-book-guns.html | title=GreenMuze | publisher=greenmuze.com | work=Recycled Book Guns | date=December 18, 2010 | accessdate=November 14, 2011 | author="Greenmuze staff"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rossia pacifica diegensis''''' is a [[subspecies]] of [[bobtail squid]] native to the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] off [[Santa Catalina Basin]], [[California]]. It occurs at greater depths than its sister [[taxon]] ''[[Rossia pacifica pacifica|R. p. pacifica]]''.&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;Reid, A. &amp; P. Jereb 2005. Family Sepiolidae. ''In:'' P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2664">'''SHEEP''' is one of the earliest interactive [[computer algebra system|symbolic computation systems]].  It is specialized for computations with [[tensor]]s, and was designed for the needs of researchers working with [[general relativity]] and other theories involving extensive tensor calculus computations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foldoc.org/sheep FOLDOC entry for SHEEP]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage.prx?exp=1748&amp;language=SHEEP Description at hopl.murdoch.edu.au]&lt;/ref&gt;

SHEEP is an [[freeware]] package (copyrighted, but free for educational and research use).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computeralgebra.nl/systemsoverview/special/tensoranalysis/sheep/sheep.ps.gz&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "SHEEP" is pun on the [[Lisp Algebraic Manipulator]] or ''LAM'' on which SHEEP is based.  The package was written by Inge Frick, using earlier work by Ian Cohen and [[Ray d'Inverno]], who had written '''ALAM''' - Atlas LISP Algebraic Manipulation in earlier (designed in 1970).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage.prx?exp=487 Entry at hopl.murdoch.edu.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311191322/http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage.prx?exp=487 |date=2011-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage2.prx?exp=487 Description at hopl.murdoch.edu.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819232418/http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage2.prx?exp=487 |date=2008-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''SHEEP''' was an [[interactive]] computer package&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/m805pw3440280205/ Interacting with SHEEP by R. A. D'inverno and I. Frick, General Relativity and Gravitation, Volume 14, Number 10, October 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas LAM and ALAM were [[batch processing]] languages.

[[Jan E. Åman]] wrote an important package in SHEEP to carry out the [[Cartan-Karlhede algorithm]]. A more recent version of SHEEP, written by Jim Skea, runs under Cambridge Lisp, which is also used for [[REDUCE (computer algebra system)|REDUCE]].

[[File:1549 siftwinnow.jpg|thumb|"Sifting and winnowing" commemorative plaque]]

'''Sifting and winnowing''' is a [[metaphor]] for the academic pursuit of truth affiliated with the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. It was coined by [[List of Presidents and Chancellors of the University of Wisconsin–Madison|UW President]] [[Charles Kendall Adams]] in an 1894 final report from a committee exonerating economics professor [[Richard T. Ely]] of censurable charges from state education superintendent [[Oliver Elwin Wells]]. The phrase became a local byword for the tenet of [[academic freedom]].

== History ==

[[File:Ely-Richard-T.jpg|thumb|Professor Richard T. Ely, whose work sparked a state challenge to academic freedom]]
In the 1890s, [[University of Wisconsin]] economics professor [[Richard T. Ely]]'s philosophy and radical practice came under fire from state education superintendent [[Oliver Elwin Wells]].{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=45}} Ely was known to be liberal and pro-union, having published a book on socialism.{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=45}} Wells protested Ely's socialist beliefs, teaching, and public speaking to UW president [[Charles Kendall Adams]] and the Board of Regents, who did not censure Ely.{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=45}} A committee appointed to address the charges produced a report that exonerated Ely upon acceptance by the regents.{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=45}} The report introduced the idea of "sifting and winnowing":{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=45}}

{{centered pull quote|As Regents of a university with over a hundred instructors supported by nearly two millions of people who hold a vast diversity of views regarding the great questions which at present agitate the human mind, we could not for a moment think of recommending the dismissal or even the criticism of a teacher even if some of his opinions should, in some quarters, be regarded as visionary. Such a course would be equivalent to saying that no professor should teach anything which is not accepted by everybody as true. This would cut our curriculum down to very small proportions. We cannot for a moment believe that knowledge has reached its final goal, or that the present condition of society is perfect. We must therefore welcome from our teachers such discussions as shall suggest the means and prepare the way by which knowledge may be extended, present evils be removed and others prevented. We feel that we would be unworthy of the position we hold if we did not believe in progress in all departments of knowledge. In all lines of academic investigation it is of the utmost importance that the investigator should be absolutely free to follow the indications of truth wherever they may lead. Whatever may be the limitations which trammel inquiry elsewhere we believe the great state University of Wisconsin should ever encourage that continual and fearless [[sifting]] and [[winnowing]] by which alone the truth can be found. |author=1894 Ely trial committee final report|source=via Herfurth's ''Sifting and Winnowing''{{sfn|Herfurth|1949|ps=, ch. 1.}} }}

[[File:Charles Kendall Adams.jpg|thumb|UW–Madison President Adams, who coined the phrase]]

Ely later referred to the report as the "Wisconsin [[Magna Charta]]" for its guarantees of academic freedom in pursuit of truth.{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=46}} In ''Decades of Chaos and Revolution'', Stephen J. Nelson contends that UW's sentiment on academic freedom had been set "well before" the 1890s.{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=45}} He added that the 1894 statement "sounds the trumpet of the fundamental principles of the academy: an unending, unlimited belief in the creed of academic freedom and inquiry."{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=45}}

The "sifting and winnowing" construction was coined by Adams, the UW president, who had defended Ely publicly and read his book.{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=46}} It was later invoked by UW–Madison Chancellor [[Robben Wright Fleming]] when responding to protestors during his tenure.{{sfn|Nelson|2012|p=44}}

In a later incident, sociology professor [[Edward Alsworth Ross]] was censured upon inviting anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] to address his class.&lt;ref name="UW kb"/&gt; He did not share her beliefs, but supported her free speech.&lt;ref name="UW kb"/&gt; In memorial of the incident, the Class of 1910 created a commemorative "sifting and winnowing" plaque of the phrase in its context, which the regents rejected.&lt;ref name="UW kb"/&gt; After the Class appealed to area newspapers, the regents relented.&lt;ref name="UW kb"/&gt; The plaque was installed on [[Bascom Hall]] in 1915, where it remains.&lt;ref name="UW kb"/&gt; It was rededicated in 1957.&lt;ref name="UW kb"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5164">Realised between 2002 and 2004, the project '''Sonic City''' was pioneer projects in [[locative media]], in particular the [[mobile music]] field which it contributed in establishing.

Sonic City was a form of interactive music instrument using the city as an interface. It enabled people to individually create a real-time personal soundscape of electronic music by walking through and interacting with urban environments. Paths turned into musical compositions and mobility through the shifting contexts of a city became a large scale musical gesture.

Worn on the body, Sonic City retrieved information about environmental context and user actions in real time, and mapped it to the live audio processing of urban sounds, resulting in music heard through headphones. One engaged into a musical duet with the city: urban atmospheres, nearby urban artefacts, random encounters, and everyday activities all participated in creating music as you were walking.

At the cross-road between urban exploration and experimental music making, Sonic City promoted the integration of everyday life settings and practices into personal forms of aesthetic expression with digital technology.

==Partnerships==

The Sonic City project was a collaboration between [[The Interactive Institute]] (Ramia Mazé and Margot Jacobs) and Future Applications Lab at the Viktoria Institute ([[Lalya Gaye]]), together with established Swedish sound-artist Daniel Skoglund (8Tunnel2).&lt;ref&gt;https://soundcloud.com/8tunnel2&lt;/ref&gt; Lalya Gaye and Ramia Mazé initiated and managed the project. Magnus Johansson and Sara Lerén ([[University of Gothenburg]]) conducted their master's theses in the project.

Sonic City was partially funded through the Smart-Its project&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smart-its.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (as part of the Disappearing Computer &lt;ref&gt;http://www.disappearing-computer.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; FET-IST research programme) and the Mobile Life project (funded by the [[Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research]]) at the Viktoria Institute. At The Interactive Institute, Sonic City was included in the Public Play Spaces research platform.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tii.se/projects/public-play-spaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Press and publication==

The project has been well-published and well-cited in academia, received a lot of attention in the new media arts scene, and has received extensive media and blog coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Lyd i Byn | date=2003 | work=Harddisken, Danmarks Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Receiver 09, Vodaphone"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.receiver.vodafone.com/09/articles/indexcenter03.html | title=Walking through Sound | date=2004 | last=Toop | first=David | work=Receiver 09, Vodaphone | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040216193852/http://www.receiver.vodafone.com/09/articles/indexcenter03.html | archivedate=2004-02-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/it_telekom/allmant/article237593.ece | title=Staden som instrument | date=2004 | last=Ryberg | first=Jonas | work=Ny Teknik}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.elmundo.es/ariadna/2005/224/1109957208.html | title=Transforma el ruido de tu barrio en una sinfonía | date=2005 | last= Jiménez De Luis | first=Angel | work=El Mundo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://we-make-money-not-art.com/interview_with_2/ | title=Interview with Lalya Gaye | date=2006 | last=Debatty | first=Régine | work=We Make Money Not Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other places, Sonic City was presented at e.g. [[NIME]] and [[Cybersonica]], and was demoed EU’s IST 2004 event in [[The Hague]] as an example of innovative European research. It was featured in the [[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo Electronic Almanac]] special issue on locative media, and discussed in a number of books &lt;ref&gt;Steffen, Alex. "Worldchanging: a User's Guide for the 21st Century" (preface by Al Gore). Abrams Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, A.

A '''subpersonality''' is, in [[transpersonal psychology]], a [[personality mode]] that kicks in (appears on a temporary basis) to allow a person to cope with certain types of [[psychosocial]] situations.&lt;ref name="Fall"&gt;Fall, Kevin A. (December 9, 2003) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pKFZKRG-IKwC&amp;pg=PA444&amp;dq=Subpersonality&amp;sig=lN_rPbMLbnsmLDNg8CeOAmiFD0M#PPA444,M1 Theoretical Models of Counseling and Psychotherapy.]'' Page 444. Publisher: Routledge. {{ISBN|1-58391-068-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to a [[complex (psychology)|complex]],&lt;ref&gt;Kivinen, Michael K. (November 1, 2007) Subconsciously Speaking. ''[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-171440400.html Coming to terms with past life regression.] Volume 22; Issue 6; Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; the mode may include thoughts, feelings, actions, physiology and other elements of human behavior to [[Impression management|self-present]] a particular mode that works to negate particular psychosocial situations.&lt;ref name="Fall"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rowan&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowan|first=J|title=Subpersonalities: The People Inside Us|year=1990|publisher=Routlege|isbn=9780415043298}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average person has about a dozen subpersonalities.&lt;ref name="Fall"/&gt;

Subpersonalities are able to perceive [[consciousness]] as something separate from themselves, as well as domestic image attached to these elements.&lt;ref name="Fall"/&gt; [[United States|American]] transpersonal philosopher [[Ken Wilber]] identifies subpersonality as "functional self-presentations that navigate particular psychosocial situations."&lt;ref name="Fall"/&gt; For example, if a harsh critic responds with judgmental thoughts, anger, superior feelings, critical words, punitive action, and/or tense physiology when confronted with her own and/or others' fallibility, that is a subpersonality of the harsh critic kicking in to cope with the confrontation situation.&lt;ref name="Fall"/&gt;

==Subpersonalities in Psychotherapy==

For a somewhat different viewpoint: Many schools of [[psychotherapy]] see '''subpersonalities''' as relatively enduring psychological structures or entities that influence how a person feels, perceives, behaves, and sees him- or herself. Over the history of psychotherapy, many forms of therapy have worked with inner diversity representations or subpersonalities.&lt;ref name="FirmanGila2002-p69"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Firman|author2=Ann Gila|title=Psychosynthesis: A Psychology of the Spirit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVPLYPfAjksC&amp;pg=PA69|date=26 September 2002|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-5534-0|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DohertyGuyler2008-p88"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nora Doherty|author2=Marcelas Guyler|title=The Essential Guide to Workplace Mediation &amp; Conflict Resolution: Rebuilding Working Relationships|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DPMgUNyO6iMC&amp;pg=PA88|year=2008|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|isbn=978-0-7494-5019-9|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early methods were [[Jungian analysis]], [[Psychosynthesis]], [[Transactional Analysis|Transactional analysis]], and [[Gestalt therapy]].

The '''superfluous man''' ({{lang-ru|лишний человек}}, ''líshniy chelovék'') is an 1840s and 1850s Russian literary concept derived from the [[Byronic hero]].&lt;ref name=c1&gt;{{Harvnb|Chances|2001|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to an individual, perhaps talented and capable, who does not fit into social norms. In most cases, this person is born into wealth and privilege.  Typical characteristics are disregard for social values, [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], and [[Existentialism|existential]] [[boredom]]; typical behaviors are gambling, drinking, romantic intrigues, and [[duel]]s.  He is often unmindful, indifferent or unempathetic with society's issues and can carelessly distress others with his actions, despite his position of power. He will often use his power for his own comfort and security and will have very little interest in being charitable or using it for the greater good. 

The superfluous man will often attempt to manipulate, control or enslave other individuals. Because he has no integrity or ambitions, he is often self-serving and sees little point to being a benefactor or helping others. He will often carelessly try to manipulate, degrade or pacify individuals within the society; in order to gain more comfort and security.

The character type originates in [[Alexander Pushkin|Alexander Pushkin's]] verse-novel ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'' (1825&amp;ndash;32). This term was popularized by [[Ivan Turgenev|Ivan Turgenev's]] novella ''[[The Diary of a Superfluous Man]]'' (1850) and was thereafter applied to characters from earlier novels.&lt;ref name=c1/&gt; [[Mikhail Lermontov|Mikhail Lermontov's]] ''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'' (1840) depicts another Superfluous Man – Pechorin – as its protagonist. He can be seen as a [[nihilism|nihilist]] and [[fatalism|fatalist]]. Later examples include [[Alexander Herzen|Alexander Herzen's]] Beltov in ''[[Who is to Blame?]]'' (1845&amp;ndash;46), [[Ivan Turgenev|Ivan Turgenev's]] ''[[Rudin]]'' (1856), and the title character of [[Ivan Goncharov|Ivan Goncharov's]] ''[[Oblomov]]'' (1859).&lt;ref name=c1/&gt;

Russian critics such as [[Vissarion Belinsky]] viewed the superfluous man as a byproduct of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]'s reign, when the best educated men would not enter the discredited government service and, lacking other options for self-realization, doomed themselves to live out their life in passivity. Scholar David Patterson describes the superfluous man as "not just...another literary type but...a paradigm of a person who has lost a point, a place, a presence in life" before concluding that "the superfluous man is a homeless man".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Patterson|1995|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The superfluous man is often in contrast politically with the [[Great man theory|great man]].

==History==
The first version of TeeChart was authored in 1995 by David Berneda, co-founder of Steema, using the [[Borland Delphi]] [[Visual Component Library]] programming environment&lt;ref name = "SteemaHist" /&gt; and TeeChart was first released as a shareware version and made available via [[Compuserve]] in the same year.&lt;ref name="keydates"&gt;{{Cite web
  | author = Steema Software SL
  | title = Key dates and build history
  | url = http://www.steema.com/history
  | accessdate = 17 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written in the first version of Delphi VCL, as a 16-bit Charting Library named TeeChart version 1.&lt;ref name="keydates"/&gt; The next version of TeeChart was released as a 32-bit library (Delphi 2 supported 32-bit compilation) but was badged as TeeChart VCL v3 to coincide with Borland's naming convention for inclusion on the toolbox palette of Borland Delphi v3 in 1997&lt;ref name="DrBob"/&gt; and with [[C++ Builder]] v3 in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | issn = 0199-6649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been on the Delphi/C++ Builder toolbox palette ever since.  The current version is Embarcadero RAD Studio 10.2 Tokyo.&lt;ref name = "RADStudio10"/&gt;

TeeChart's first [[ActiveX]] version named "version 3" too, to match the VCL version's nomenclature, was released in 1998.&lt;ref name="keydates"/&gt; The version was optimised to work with [[Microsoft]]'s [[Visual Studio]] v97 and v6.0 developer suites that include [[Visual Basic]] and [[Microsoft Visual C++]] programming languages. Support for new programming environments followed with TeeChart's first native C# version for [[Microsoft Visual Studio .NET]] released in 2002&lt;ref name="keydates"/&gt; and TeeChart{{Not a typo|.}}Lite for .NET, a free charting component, released for Visual Studio.NET in 2003&lt;ref name="keydates"/&gt; and supporting too, [[Mono (programming)]]. Steema Software released the first native TeeChart [[Java (programming language)]] version in 2006&lt;ref name="keydates"/&gt; and TeeChart's first native [[PHP]] version was released in 2009 and published as [[open-source]] in June 2010.&lt;ref name="keydates"/&gt; Mobile versions of TeeChart, for [[Android (operating system)]] devices and [[Windows Phone 7]] devices were released during the first half of 2011.&lt;ref name="keydates"/&gt; In 2012 TeeChart extended functionality to [[iPhone]]/[[iPad]] and [[BlackBerry OS]] devices and a new [[JavaScript]] version was released in the same year to support [[HTML5 Canvas]]. In 2013 Steema launched TeeChart for .NET Chart for [[Windows Store app|Windows Store]] applications and included support for Microsoft's [[Windows Phone 8]] mobile platform.&lt;ref name="keydates"/&gt; TeeChart for Xamarin.Forms written with 100% C# code and cross-platform support for .NET desktops, Windows Phone, iOS and Android was released in 2014. Also since 2014 Webforms charts now offers HTML5 interactivity.&lt;ref name="keydates"/&gt;

==Usage==
TeeChart is a general purpose charting component designed for use in differing ambits, offering a wide range of aesthetics to chart data. Generally TeeCharts published in the field, in areas where large amounts of data must be interpreted regularly, remain by designer choice in their simplest form to maximize the "data-ink ratio".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The SDSS chart authors choose to represent data using TeeChart's standard 2D line display. Speed is also a factor when choosing how to most effectively plot data. Realtime data, at frequencies of up to tens or hundreds of data points or more per second, require the most processor economic approach to charting. Computer processing time dedicated to the plotting of data needs to be as lightweight as possible, freeing-up computer tasks "to achieve real-time data acquisition, display and analysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

An important and stated aspect of many data visualisation applications is the ability to offer interactivity to the user; [[NASA]]'s document, the Orbital Debris Engineering Model Model ORDEM 3.0 - User's Guide, 2014, states that "The user may manipulate the graphs to zoom, pan, and copy to the clipboard and export to various file types"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Charting applications have become increasingly 'onlined', made available either to a wider public or to a territorially remote userbase via networked applications. The [[World wide web]] (the Web) has become "by far, the most popular Internet protocol" to disseminate online applications. Most major IDEs now offer environments for web application developede aimed at browser hosted applications. Charting components, TeeChart among them, have adapted to provide models that work within a browser environment, often using static images and scripted layering techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)]] to offer a level of interactivity, improve response times and hide apparent delay from the user. Options to enrich client, browser-side processing flexibility are exploited by TeeChart libraries via modules that offer 'micro-environments' within the browser, such as the long established [[ActiveX]] technology, [[Adobe Flash]], Microsoft [[Silverlight]] or Java [[Applets]]. Serverside environments offer too, a means to interact with browser based script to dynamically respond to charting requests. [[Joomla]] and [[CodeIgniter]] are host environments for TeeChart PHP and an example of an Embarcadero IntraWeb VCL designed application using TeeChart, is documented here.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The '''time-saving bias''' describes people's tendency to misestimate the time that could be saved (or lost) when increasing (or decreasing) speed. In general, people underestimate the time that could be saved when increasing from a relatively low speed (e.g., 25&amp;nbsp;mph or 40&amp;nbsp;km/h) and overestimate the time that could be saved when increasing from a relatively high speed (e.g., 55&amp;nbsp;mph or 90&amp;nbsp;km/h). People also underestimate the time that could be lost when decreasing from a low speed and overestimate the time that could be lost when decreasing from a high speed.

== Examples ==

In one study, participants were asked to judge which of two road improvement plans would be more efficient in reducing mean journey time. Respondents preferred a plan that would increase the mean speed from 70 to 110&amp;nbsp;km/h more than a plan that would increase the mean speed from 30 to 40&amp;nbsp;km/h, although the latter actually saves more time (Svenson, 2008, Experiment 1).

In another study drivers were asked to indicate how much time they feel can be saved when increasing from either a low (30&amp;nbsp;mph) or high (60&amp;nbsp;mph) speed (Fuller et al., 2009). For example, participants were asked the following question: "You are driving along an open road. How much time do you feel you would gain if you drove for 10 miles at 40&amp;nbsp;mph instead of 30&amp;nbsp;mph?" (Fuller et al., 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;14). Another question had a higher starting speed (60&amp;nbsp;mph) and two other questions asked about losing time when decreasing speed (from either 30 or 60&amp;nbsp;mph).

Results supported the predictions of the time-saving bias as participants underestimated the time saved when increasing from a low speed and overestimated the time saved when increasing from a relatively high speed. In addition, participants also misestimated the time lost when decreasing speed: they generally underestimated the time lost when decreasing from a low speed and overestimated the time lost when decreasing from a relatively high speed (Fuller et al., 2009).

== Explanation ==
[[File:Time-saving-bias.svg|thumb|Time savings from extra 10 mph decrease as speed increases]]
The physical formula for calculating the time, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, gained when increasing speed is:

&lt;math&gt;t = c D(v_1^{-1} - v_2^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is constant and used to transform between units of measurement, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time gained, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the distance traveled and &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; are the original and increased speeds, respectively. This formula shows that the relationship between increasing speed and journey time is curvilinear: a similar speed increase would result in more time saved when increasing from a low speed compared to a higher speed. For example, when increasing from 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;mph the time required to complete 10 miles decreases from 30 to 20 minutes, saving 10 minutes. However, the same speed increase of 10&amp;nbsp;mph would result in less time saved if the initial speed is higher (e.g., only 2 minutes saved when increasing from 50&amp;nbsp;mph to 60&amp;nbsp;mph). Changing the distance of the journey from 10 miles to a longer or shorter distance will increase or decrease these time savings, but will not affect the relationship between speed and time savings.

Svenson (2008) suggested that people’s judgments of time-savings actually follow a Proportion heuristic, by which people judge the time saved as the proportion of the speed increase from the initial speed. Another study suggested that people might follow a simpler difference heuristic, by which they judge the time saved based solely on the difference between the initial and higher speed (Peer, 2010b, Study 3). It seems that people falsely believe that journey time decreases somewhat linearly as driving speed increases, irrespective of the initial speed, causing the time-saving bias. Although it is still unclear what is the dominant heuristic people use to estimate time savings, it is evident that almost none follow the above curvelinear relationship.

== Consequences in driving ==

Drivers who underestimated the time saved when increasing from a low speed or overestimated the time lost when decreasing from a high speed, overestimated the speed required for arriving on a specific time and chose unduly high speeds, sometimes even exceeding the stated speed limit (Peer, 2010a). Similarly, drivers who overestimated the time saved when increasing from a high speed underestimated the speed required for arriving on time and chose lower speeds (Peer, 2011).

== Consequences in other domains ==

The time-saving bias is not limited to driving. The same faulty estimations emerge when people are asked to estimate savings in patients’ waiting time when adding more physicians to a health care center (Svenson, 2008, Experiment 2) or when estimating an increase in the productivity of a manufacturing line by adding more workers (Svenson, 2011).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19369">The '''Toyota Production System''' ('''TPS''') is an integrated [[Socio-technical systems|socio-technical system]], developed by [[Toyota]], that comprises its management philosophy and practices. The TPS organizes manufacturing and logistics for the automobile manufacturer, including interaction with suppliers and customers. The system is a major precursor of the more generic "[[lean manufacturing]]". [[Taiichi Ohno]] and [[Eiji Toyoda]], Japanese industrial engineers, developed the system between 1948 and 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Strategos-International. [http://www.strategosinc.com/toyota_production.htm To'''yota Production System and Lean Manufacturing].&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally called "[[Just in time (business)|just-in-time production]]", it builds on the approach created by the founder of Toyota, [[Sakichi Toyoda]], his son [[Kiichiro Toyoda]], and the engineer [[Taiichi Ohno]]. The principles underlying the TPS are embodied in [[The Toyota Way]].

==Goals==
The main objectives of the TPS are to design out overburden ([[Muri (Japanese term)|muri]]) and inconsistency ([[Mura (Japanese term)|mura]]), and to eliminate waste ([[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]]). The most significant effects on process value delivery are achieved by designing a process capable of delivering the required results smoothly; by designing out "mura" (inconsistency). It is also crucial to ensure that the process is as flexible as necessary without stress or "muri" (overburden) since this generates "muda" (waste). Finally the tactical improvements of waste reduction or the elimination of muda are very valuable. There are eight kinds of muda that are addressed in the TPS:&lt;ref name="Ohno1998"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Waste of overproduction (largest waste)
# Waste of time on hand (waiting)
# Waste of transportation 
# Waste of processing itself
# Waste of stock at hand
# Waste of movement
# Waste of making defective products
# Waste of underutilized workers

The elimination of waste has come to dominate the thinking of many when they look at the effects of the TPS because it is the most familiar of the three to implement. In the TPS many initiatives are triggered by inconsistency or over-run reduction which drives out waste without specific focus on its reduction.

==Concept==
Toyota Motor Corporation published an official description of TPS for the first time in 1992; this booklet was revised in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Toyota Motor Corporation: ''The Toyota Production System – Leaner manufacturing for a greener planet''; TMC, Public Affairs Division, Tokyo, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreword it was said: "The TPS is a framework for conserving resources by eliminating waste. People who participate in the system learn to identify expenditures of material, effort and time that do not generate value for customers and furthermore we have, avoid a 'how-to' approach. The booklet is not a manual. Rather it is an overview of the concepts, that underlie our production system. It is a reminder that lasting gains in productivity and quality are possible whenever and wherever management and employees are united in a commitment to positive change". TPS is grounded on two main conceptual pillars:
# ''[[Just-in-time manufacturing|Just-in-time]]''&lt;ref&gt;ibidem,  p. 11 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; – meaning "Making only what is needed, only when it is needed, and only in the amount that is needed"
# ''[[Jidoka]]''&lt;ref&gt;ibidem,  p. 25 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; –  (Autonomation) meaning "Automation with a human touch"

Toyota has developed various tools to transfer these concepts into practice and apply them to specific requirements and conditions in the company and business.

==Origins==
This system, more than any other aspect of the company, is responsible for having made Toyota the company it is today. Toyota has long been recognized as a leader in the automotive manufacturing and production industry.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Bremner, B. and C. Dawson (November 17, 2003). [https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2003-11-16/can-anything-stop-toyota "Can Anything Stop Toyota?: An inside look at how it's reinventing the auto industry"]. ''Business Week.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Industrial engineering]] is the wider science behind TPS.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

It is a myth that "Toyota received their inspiration for the system, not from the American automotive industry (at that time the world's largest by far), but from visiting a supermarket".  The idea of just-in-time production was originated by [[Kiichiro Toyoda]], founder of Toyota.&lt;ref name="Ohno1988"&gt;{{Citation
 | last = Ohno | first =  Taiichi
 |date=March 1988
 | title = Just-In-Time For Today and Tomorrow
 | isbn = 978-0-915299-20-1
 | publisher = Productivity Press
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question was how to implement the idea.  In reading descriptions of American supermarkets, Ohno saw the supermarket as the model for what he was trying to accomplish in the factory.  A customer in a supermarket takes the desired amount of goods off the shelf and purchases them.  The store restocks the shelf with enough new product to fill up the shelf space.  Similarly, a work-center that needed parts would go to a "store shelf" (the inventory storage point) for the particular part and "buy" (withdraw) the quantity it needed, and the "shelf" would be "restocked" by the work-center that produced the part, making only enough to replace the inventory that had been withdrawn.&lt;ref name="Ohno1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Magee2007"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While low inventory levels are a key outcome of the Toyota Production System, an important element of the philosophy behind its system is to work intelligently and eliminate waste so that only minimal inventory is needed.&lt;ref name="Ohno1988" /&gt; Many Western businesses, having observed Toyota's factories, set out to attack high inventory levels directly without understanding what made these reductions possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What is this thing called Theory of Constraints and how should it be implemented?|first=Eliyahu M.|last=Goldratt|publisher=North River Press|year=1990|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of imitating without understanding the underlying concept or motivation may have led to the failure of those projects.{{Citation needed| date = April 2012}}

==Principles==
{{Main article|The Toyota Way}}
The underlying principles, called the Toyota Way, have been outlined by Toyota as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Toyota internal document, "The Toyota Way 2001," April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toyota Motor Corporation Sustainability Report, 2009, page 54&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuous improvement===
*'''Challenge'''  (We form a long-term vision, meeting challenges with courage and creativity to realize our dreams.)
*'''[[Kaizen]]'''  (We improve our business operations continuously, always driving for innovation and evolution.)
*'''[[Genchi Genbutsu]]'''  (Go to the source to find the facts to make correct decisions.)

===Respect for people===
*'''Respect''' (We respect others, make every effort to understand each other, take responsibility and do our best to build mutual trust.)
*'''Teamwork'''  (We stimulate personal and professional growth, share the opportunities of development and maximize individual and team performance.)

External observers have summarized the principles of the Toyota Way as:&lt;ref name="The Toyota Way"&gt;Liker, J. 2004. ''The Toyota Way: 14 Management Principles from the World's Greatest Manufacturer.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term philosophy===
#Base your management decisions on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term financial goals.

===The right process will produce the right results===
#Create continuous process flow to bring problems to the surface.
#Use the [[Kanban|"pull" system]] to avoid overproduction.
#Level out the workload ([[heijunka]]). (Work like the tortoise, not the hare.)
#Build a culture of stopping to fix problems, to get quality right from the start. ([[Autonomation|Jidoka]])
#Standardized tasks are the foundation for continuous improvement and employee empowerment.
#Use visual control so no problems are hidden.
#Use only reliable, thoroughly tested technology that serves your people and processes.

===Add value to the organization by developing your people and partners===
#Grow leaders who thoroughly understand the work, live the philosophy, and teach it to others.
#Develop exceptional people and teams who follow your company's philosophy.
#Respect your extended network of partners and suppliers by challenging them and helping them improve.

===Continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning===
#Go and see for yourself to thoroughly understand the situation ([[Genchi Genbutsu]], 現地現物);
#Make decisions slowly by consensus, thoroughly considering all options ([[Nemawashi]], 根回し); implement decisions rapidly;
#Become a learning organization through relentless [[Human self-reflection|reflection]] ([[Hansei]], 反省) and continuous improvement and never stop([[Kaizen]], 改善).

The Toyota production system has been compared to squeezing water from a dry towel. What this means is that it is a system for thorough waste elimination. Here, waste refers to anything which does not advance the process, everything that does not increase added value. Many people settle for eliminating the waste that everyone recognizes as waste. But much remains that simply has not yet been recognized as waste or that people are willing to tolerate.

People had resigned themselves to certain problems, had become hostage to routine and abandoned the practice of problem-solving. This going back to basics, exposing the real significance of problems and then making fundamental improvements, can be witnessed throughout the Toyota Production System.&lt;ref&gt;A study of the Toyota Production System, Shigeo Shingo, Productivity Press, 1989, p236&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sharing==
Toyota originally began sharing TPS with its parts suppliers in the 1990s. Because of interest in the program from other organizations, Toyota began offering instruction in the methodology to others. Toyota has even "donated" its system to charities, providing its engineering staff and techniques to non-profits in an effort to increase their efficiency and thus ability to serve people. For example, Toyota assisted the [[Food Bank For New York City]] to significantly decrease waiting times at soup kitchens, packing times at a food distribution center, and waiting times in a food pantry.&lt;ref name=nyt2013&gt;{{cite news|last=El-Naggar|first=Mona|title=In Lieu of Money, Toyota Donates Efficiency to New York Charity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/nyregion/in-lieu-of-money-toyota-donates-efficiency-to-new-york-charity.html?_r=0|accessdate=1 September 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toyota announced on June 29, 2011 the launch of a national program to donate its Toyota Production System expertise towards nonprofit organizations with goal of improving their operations, extending their reach, and increasing their impact.&lt;ref name=tps&gt;{{cite press release |last= |first= |date= June 29, 2011|title= Toyota Launches National Program to Expand Efforts to Help Schools, Hospitals and Community Organizations Make the Most of Every Dollar|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/toyota-launches-national-program-to-expand-efforts-to-help-schools-hospitals-and-community-organizations-make-the-most-of-every-dollar-124700543.html |location=Chicago, Illinois |publisher= PR Newswire|agency= PR Newswire US|access-date=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September, less than three months later, [[SPB (nonprofit organization)|SPB]], a disaster relief organization based out of New Orleans, reported that their home rebuilds had been reduced from 12 to 18 weeks, to 6 weeks.&lt;ref name="toyota"&gt;{{cite press release|author1=Toyota|title=Toyota Helps to Speed Post-Katrina Homebuilding, Reports Major New Orleans Nonprofit|journal=Business Wire|date=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, employing Toyota methods (like ''[[kaizen]]''&lt;ref name="boss"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=BOSS|first1=SUZIE|title=Engineering Higher Efficiency|journal=Stanford Social Innovation Review|date=Winter 2012|volume=10|issue=1|pages=56-57|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/engineering_higher_efficiency|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) had reduced construction errors by 50 percent.&lt;ref name="toyota"/&gt; The company included SBP among its first 20 community organizations, along with AmeriCorps.&lt;ref name=tps/&gt;

==''Workplace Management''==
Taiichi Ohno's ''Workplace Management'' (2007) outlines in 38 chapters how to implement the TPS system. Some important concepts are:
*Chapter 1 ''Wise Mend Their Ways'' - See the [[Analects of Confucius]] for further information.
*Chapter 4 ''Confirm Failures With Your Own Eyes''  
*Chapter 11 ''Wasted Motion Is Not Work''
*Chapter 15 ''Just In Time'' - Phrase invented by Kiichiro Toyoda - the first president of Toyota. There is conflict on what the actual English translation of what "just in time" really means. Taiichi Ohno quoted from the book says " 'Just In Time' should be interpreted to mean that it is a problem when parts are delivered too early".&lt;ref name = workplace-management&gt;Ohno, Taiichi  (2007), ''Workplace Management''. Translated by Jon Miller, Gemba Press, {{ISBN|978-0-9786387-5-7}}, {{ISBN|0-9786387-5-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chapter 23 ''How To Produce At A Lower Cost'' - "One of the main fundamentals of the Toyota System is to make 'what you need, in the amount you need, by the time you need it', but to tell the truth there is another part to this and that is 'at lower cost'.  But that part is not written down."&lt;ref name = workplace-management /&gt; World economies, events, and each individual job also play a part in production specifics.

Voigts, B. Schaff &amp;M. Pietrzak-Franger (Eds.). Reflecting on Darwin. Farnham, London: Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a variety of approaches that extend the theory of [[Darwinism]] beyond its original domain of [[biological evolution]] on Earth. Universal Darwinism aims to formulate a generalized version of the mechanisms of [[Genetic diversity|variation]], [[natural selection|selection]] and [[heredity]] proposed by [[Charles Darwin]], so that they can apply to explain [[Evolution (disambiguation)|evolution]] in a wide variety of other domains, including [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[culture]], [[medicine]], [[computer science]] and [[physics]].

==Basic mechanisms==
At the most fundamental level, [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] states that organisms evolve and [[Adaptation|adapt]] to their environment by an iterative process.  This process can be conceived as an [[evolutionary algorithm]] that searches the space of possible forms (the [[fitness landscape]]) for the ones that are best adapted. The process has three components:

* [[Genetic diversity|variation]] of a given form or template. This is usually (but not necessarily) considered to be blind or random, and happens typically by [[mutation]] or [[genetic recombination|recombination]].
* [[Selection (biology)|selection]] of the [[fitness (biology)|fittest]] variants, i.e. those that are best suited to survive and reproduce in their given environment. The unfit variants are eliminated.
* [[heredity]] or retention, meaning that the features of the fit variants are retained and passed on, e.g. in offspring.

After those fit variants are retained, they can again undergo variation, either directly or in their offspring, starting a new round of the [[iteration]]. The overall mechanism is similar to the problem-solving procedures of [[trial-and-error]] or generate-and-test: evolution can be seen as searching for the best solution for the problem  of how to survive and reproduce by generating new trials, testing how well they perform, eliminating the failures, and retaining the successes.

The generalization made in "universal" Darwinism is to replace "organism" by any recognizable pattern, phenomenon, or system. The first requirement is that the pattern can "survive" (maintain, be retained) long enough or "reproduce" (replicate, be copied) sufficiently frequently so as not to disappear immediately. This is the heredity component: the information in the pattern must be retained or passed on. The second requirement is that during survival and reproduction variation (small changes in the pattern) can occur. The final requirement is that there  is a selective "preference" so that certain variants tend to survive or reproduce "better" than others. If these conditions are met, then, by the logic of natural selection, the pattern will evolve towards more adapted forms.

Examples of patterns that have been postulated to undergo variation and selection, and thus adaptation, are [[genes]], ideas ([[memes]]), theories, technologies, [[neurons]] and their connections, words, computer programs, firms, [[antibodies]], institutions, law and judicial systems, quantum states and even whole universes.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, John (2009).

&lt;/ref&gt; but was still lacking the concept of natural selection. Darwin himself, together with subsequent 19th century thinkers such as [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Thorstein Veblen]], [[James Mark Baldwin]] and [[William James]], was quick to apply the idea of selection to other domains, such as language, psychology, society, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, G. M. (2005). Generalizing Darwinism to social evolution: Some early attempts. Journal of economic issues, 899–914&lt;/ref&gt; However, this evolutionary tradition was largely banned from the social sciences in the beginning of the 20th century, in part because of the bad reputation of [[social Darwinism]], an attempt to use Darwinism to justify social inequality.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Starting in the 1950s, [[Donald T. Campbell]] was one of  the first and most influential authors to revive the tradition, and to formulate a generalized Darwinian [[algorithm]] directly applicable to phenomena outside of biology.&lt;ref&gt;Gontier, N. (2006). Evolutionary Epistemology. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. http://www.iep.utm.edu/evo-epis/&lt;/ref&gt; In this, he was inspired by [[William Ross Ashby]]'s view of [[self-organization]] and intelligence as fundamental processes of selection.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D. T. (1960). Blind variation and selective retention in creative thought as in other knowledge processes. Psychological Review, 67(6), 380–400.&lt;/ref&gt; His aim was to explain the development of [[science]] and other forms of [[knowledge]] by focusing on the variation and selection of ideas and theories, thus laying the basis for the domain of [[evolutionary epistemology]]. In the 1990s, Campbell's formulation of the mechanism of "blind-variation-and-selective-retention" (BVSR) was further developed and extended to other domains under the labels of "universal selection theory"&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D. T. (1990). Epistemological roles for selection theory. Evolution, cognition, and realism: Studies in evolutionary epistemology, 1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; or "universal selectionism"&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, G. M.

[[Richard Dawkins]] may have first coined the term "universal Darwinism" in 1983 to describe his conjecture that any possible life forms existing outside the solar system would evolve by natural selection just as they do on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, R. (1983) Universal Darwinism. In: Evolution from molecules to man, ed. D.&amp;nbsp;S. Bendall. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This conjecture was also presented in 1983 in a paper entitled “The Darwinian Dynamic” that dealt with the evolution of order in living systems and certain nonliving physical systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, Byerly HC, Hopf FA, Michod RA, Vemulapalli GK. (1983) The Darwinian Dynamic. Quarterly Review of Biology 58, 185-207.  {{jstor|2828805}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was suggested “that ‘life’, wherever it might exist in the universe, evolves according to the same dynamical law” termed the Darwinian dynamic.  [[Henry Plotkin]] in his 1997 book&lt;ref&gt;Plotkin, H. C. (1997). Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Darwin machines]] makes the link between universal Darwinism and Campbell's evolutionary epistemology. [[Susan Blackmore]], in her 1999 book ''[[The Meme Machine]]'', devotes a chapter titled 'Universal Darwinism' to a discussion of the applicability of the Darwinian process to a wide range of scientific subject matters.

The philosopher of mind [[Daniel Dennett]], in his 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', developed the idea of a Darwinian process, involving variation, selection and retention, as a generic algorithm that is substrate-neutral and could be applied to many fields of knowledge outside of biology. He described the idea of natural selection as a "universal acid" that cannot be contained in any vessel, as it seeps through the walls and spreads ever further, touching and transforming ever more domains. He notes in particular the field of [[memetics]] in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel C. (2005), Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Touchstone Press, New York. pp. 352&amp;ndash;360.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In agreement with Dennett's prediction, over the past decades the Darwinian perspective has spread ever more widely, in particular across the [[social sciences]] as the foundation for numerous schools of study including [[memetics]], [[evolutionary economics]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[evolutionary anthropology]], [[neural Darwinism]], and [[evolutionary linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;Oudeyer, P.-Y. and Kaplan, F. (2007) [http://www.pyoudeyer.com/oudeyer-kaplan-cp07.pdf Language Evolution as a Darwinian Process: Computational Studies]. Cognitive Processing, 8(1):21&amp;ndash;35&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have postulated Darwinian processes as operating at the foundations of physics, cosmology and chemistry via the theories of [[quantum Darwinism]],&lt;ref&gt;
Blume-Kohou, Robin and Zurek, Wojciech. (2006). Quantum Darwinism: Entanglement, branches, and the emergent classicality of redundantly stored quantum information, Journal-ref: Phys. Rev. A 73, 062310 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthropic principle|observation selection effects]] and [[cosmological natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;

Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smolin, Lee (2008), Scientific Alternatives to the Anthropic Principle, Contribution to "Universe or Multiverse", ed. by Bernard Carr et al., to be published by Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar mechanisms are extensively applied in [[computer science]] in the domains of [[genetic algorithms]] and [[evolutionary computation]], which develop solutions to complex problems via a process of variation and selection.

Author D. B. Kelley has formulated one of the most all-encompassing approaches to Universal Darwinism. In his 2013 book ''The Origin of Everything'', he holds that [[natural selection]] involves not the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life, as shown by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], but the preservation of favored systems in contention for existence. The fundamental mechanism behind all such stability and evolution is therefore what Kelley calls "[[survival of the fittest]] systems."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origin of Everything via Universal Selection, or the Preservation of Favored Systems in Contention for Existence|last=Kelley|first=D. B.|publisher=Woodhollow Press|year=2013|isbn=0985462507|location=Newbury, Ohio|pages=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because all systems are cyclical, the Darwinian processes of [[iteration]], variation and [[Natural selection|selection]] are operative not only among species but among all natural phenomena both large-scale and small. Kelley thus maintains that, since the [[Big Bang]] especially, the [[universe]] has evolved from a highly chaotic state to one that is now highly ordered with many stable phenomena, naturally selected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==Examples of universal Darwinist theories==
The following approaches can all be seen as exemplifying a generalization of Darwinian ideas outside of their original domain of biology. These "Darwinian extensions" can be grouped in two categories, depending on whether they discuss implications of biological (genetic) evolution in other disciplines (e.g. medicine or psychology), or discuss processes of variation and selection of entities other than genes (e.g. computer programs, firms or ideas). However, there is no strict separation possible, since most of these approaches (e.g. in sociology, psychology and linguistics) consider both genetic and non-genetic (e.g. cultural) aspects of evolution, as well as the interactions between them (see e.g. [[gene-culture coevolution]]).

===Gene-based Darwinian extensions===

*[[Evolutionary medicine]] investigates the origin of diseases by looking at the evolution both of the human body and of its parasites
*[[Paleolithic diet]] proposes that the most healthy nutrition is the one to which our hunter-gatherer ancestors have adapted over millions of years
*[[Paleolithic lifestyle]] generalizes the paleolithic diet to include exercise, behavior and exposure to the environment
*[[Molecular evolution]] studies evolution at the level of DNA, RNA and proteins
*[[Biosocial criminology]] studies crime using several different approaches that include genetics and evolutionary psychology
*[[Evolutionary linguistics]] studies the evolution of language, biologically as well as culturally&lt;ref&gt;Schleicher, August. ''Darwinism Tested by the Science of Language.'' (Transl. by Alexander V. W. Bikkers) London, J. C. Hotten (1869)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Darwinian extensions===
*[[Quantum Darwinism]] sees the emergence of classical states in physics as a natural selection of the most stable quantum properties
*[[Cosmological natural selection]] hypothesizes that universes reproduce and are selected for having fundamental constants that maximize "fitness"
*[[Complex adaptive systems]] models the dynamics of complex systems in part on the basis of the variation and selection of its components
*[[Evolutionary computation]] is a Darwinian approach to the generation of adapted computer programs
*[[Genetic algorithms]], a subset of evolutionary computation, models variation by "genetic" operators (mutation and recombination)

*[[Evolutionary art]] uses variation and selection to produce works of art
*[[Evolutionary music]] does the same for works of music
*[[Clonal selection theory]] sees the creation of adapted antibodies in the immune system as a process of variation and selection
*[[Neural Darwinism]] proposes that neurons and their synapses are selectively pruned during brain development

*[[Memetics]] is a theory of the variation, transmission, and selection of cultural items, such as ideas, fashions, and traditions
*[[Dual inheritance theory]] a framework for cultural evolution developed largely independently of [[memetics]]
*[[Cultural selection theory]] is a theory of cultural evolution related to [[memetics]]
*[[Evolutionary economics]] studies the variation and selection of economic phenomena, such as commodities, technologies, institutions and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Shiozawa, Y. 2004 Evolutionary Economics in the 21st Century: A Manifesto, ''Evolutionary and  Institutional Economics Review,'' '''1'''(1): 5-47.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Evolutionary ethics]] investigates the origin of morality, and uses Darwinian foundations to formulate ethical values
*[[Big History]] is the science-based narrative integrating the history of the universe, earth, life, and humanity. Scholars consider Universal Darwinism to be a possible unifying theme for the discipline. &lt;ref&gt;Baker, D.

[[File:Worried little girl.jpg|thumb|left|130px|A young girl looking worried.]]
Psychologically, worry is part of
[[Perseverative Cognition]] (a collective term for continuous thinking about negative events in the past or in the future).&lt;ref name="BPT2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brosschot | first1 = J.F. | last2 = Pieper | first2 = S. | last3 = Thayer | first3 = J.F. | year = 2005 | title = Expanding Stress Theory: Prolonged Activation And Perseverative Cognition | url = | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 30 | issue = 10| pages = 1043–9 | doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.04.008 | pmid=15939546}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[emotion]] "worry" is experienced from [[anxiety]] or concern about a real or imagined issue, often personal issues such as health or finances, or external broader issues such as environmental pollution, social structure or technological change. It’s a natural response to anticipated future problems. Excessive worry is a primary diagnostic feature of [[generalized anxiety disorder]]. Most people experience short-lived periods of worry in their lives without incident; indeed, a mild amount of worrying have positive effects, if it prompts people to take precautions (e.g., fastening their [[seat belt]] or buying insurance) or avoid [[risk]]y behaviors (e.g., angering dangerous animals, or [[binge drinking]]), but with excessive worrisome people they overestimate future dangers in their assessments and in its extremities tend to [[Exaggeration|magnify]] the situation as a dead end which results stress. Overestimation happens because analytic resources are a combination of external [[locus of control]], personal experience and belief fallacies. Chronically worried individuals are also more likely to lack confidence in their problem solving ability, perceive problems as threats, become easily frustrated when dealing with a problem, and are pessimistic about the outcome of problem-solving efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Intolerance of uncertainty and perceived threat|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000579670700201X|journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy|date = 2008-01-01|pages = 28–38|volume = 46|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.brat.2007.09.006|first = Keith|last = Bredemeier|first2 = Howard|last2 = Berenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seriously anxious people find it difficult to control their worry and typically experience symptoms like Restlessness, Fatigue, Difficulty in concentrating, Irritability, Muscle tension and Sleep disturbance.

== Theories ==
{{Mental state}}

=== Avoidance model ===
The avoidance model of worry (AMW) theorizes that worry is a verbal linguistic, thought based activity, which arises as an attempt to inhibit vivid mental imagery and associated somatic and emotional activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Generalized anxiety disorderL advances in research and practic|last = Borkovec|first = T. D.|publisher = Guilford Press|year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = 77–108|last2 = Alcaine|first2 = O.M.|last3 = Behar|first3 = E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inhibition precludes the emotional processing of fear that is theoretically necessary for successful [[habituation]] and extinction of feared stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fear Extinction and Emotional Processing Theory|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199735969.003.0017|pages = 27–43|doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199735969.003.0017|first = Seth J.|last = Gillihan|first2 = Edna B.|last2 = Foa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worry is reinforced as a coping technique due to the fact that most worries never actually occur, leaving the worrier with a feeling of having successfully controlled the feared situation, without the unpleasant sensations associated with exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Current theoretical models of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): Conceptual review and treatment implications|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2009.07.006|journal = Journal of Anxiety Disorders|pages = 1011–1023|volume = 23|issue = 8|doi = 10.1016/j.janxdis.2009.07.006|first = Evelyn|last = Behar|first2 = Ilyse Dobrow|last2 = DiMarco|first3 = Eric B.|last3 = Hekler|first4 = Jan|last4 = Mohlman|first5 = Alison M.|last5 = Staples|pmid=19700258|date=Dec 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive model ===
This model explains pathological worry to be an interaction between involuntary (bottom-up) processes, such as habitual biases in attention and interpretation favoring threat content, and voluntary (top-down) processes, such as attentional control. Emotional processing biases influence the probability of threat representations into the awareness as intruding negative or positive thoughts. At a pre-conscious level, these processes influence the competition among mental representations in which some correspond to the assertive power of worry with impaired cognitive process and others to the preventive power of worry with attentional control or exhaustive vigilance. The biases determine threatening degree and nature of worry content the worrier attempts to resolve the perceived threat and the redirection of anticipations, responses and coping in such situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = R.H | first1 = Colette | last2 = Mathews | first2 = Andrew | year = 2012 | title = A cognitive model of pathological worry | url = | journal =  Behaviour Research and Therapy  | volume = 50 | issue = 10 | pages = 636–646 | doi=10.1016/j.brat.2012.06.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some who respond to mental representations in an uncertain or ambiguous state in regard to the stressful or upsetting event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Cognitive Model of Generalized Anxiety Disorder: the Role of Intolerance of Uncertainty|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470713143.ch12/summary|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|date = 2006-01-01|isbn = 9780470713143|pages = 201–216|doi = 10.1002/9780470713143.ch12|first = Naomi|last = Koerner|first2 = Michel J.|last2 = Dugas|editor-first = Graham C. L.|editor-last = Davey|editor-first2 = Adrian|editor-last2 = Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this state the worrier is held in a perpetual state of worry. This is because availability of an overwhelming number(maybe 2 or 3, depending upon the worry-prone individual) of possibilities of outcomes which can be generated, it puts the worrier in a threatening crisis and they focus their attentional control voluntarily on the potential negative outcomes, whereas others engage in a constructive problem solving manner and in a benign approach rather than to engage with heightened anticipation on the possible negative outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Targeting Intolerance of Uncertainty|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118330043.ch3/summary|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 9781118330043|pages = 57–85|doi = 10.1002/9781118330043.ch3|first = Melisa|last = Robichaud|editor-first = Gregoris|editor-last = Simos|editor-first2 = Stefan G.|editor-last2 = Hofmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical perspectives==
Greek thinkers such as [[Stoicism|stoic]] [[philosopher]] [[Epictetus]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] advised against worry. [[Albert Ellis]], the inventor of [[cognitive behavioural therapy]], was inspired by the Stoics’ therapeutic ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J., [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/wellbeing/10146546/Anxious-Depressed-Try-Greek-philosophy.html Anxious? Depressed? Try Greek philosophy], The Telegraph 29 June 2013, accessed 8 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious perspectives ==
[[Image:Guido Reni 040.jpg|thumb|right|[[Guido Reni]]'s 17th-century painting of [[John the Baptist]] depicts anguish and worry.]]
The [[Hebrew Bible|biblical]] word used in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for worry ({{lang-he|דָּאַג}}, ''{{transl|he|daag}}'') regards worry as a combined form of fear and sorrow which affects [[nephesh]], the totality of our being. The bible takes a fortitude-strengthening approach regarding worrying e.g. [[Psalm 94]]:
:''In the multitude of my anxieties within me, your comforts delight my soul.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Psalms|94:19|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Testament]], the [[Gospel of Matthew]] encourages:
:''And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life? ... So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. Today’s trouble is enough for today.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|6:27,34|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
St. Paul writes to the [[Philippi]]an church, "There is no need to worry" &lt;ref&gt;Philippians 4:6 - [[Jerusalem Bible]]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[pastoral epistles]], 2 Timothy 1:7 emboldens:
:''For [[God]] did not give us a spirit of [[cowardice]], but rather a spirit of power and of love and of [[self-discipline]].''
Similarly [[Epistle of James|James]] 1:2-4 motivates to face trials of any kind with joy, because they produce endurance (strength and courage). Further [[Saint Peter]] reveals his understanding of healthy living in [[Second Peter]] 1:3,5-7:
:''We have a sure hope ... this is a cause of great joy for us.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-Revised-Standard-Version-NRSV-Bible/ "New Revised Standard Version"] Retrieved on 2015-01-17&lt;/ref&gt;

A late [[India]]n spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] stated that worry is caused by desires and can be overcome through detachment:
:''Worry is the product of feverish imagination working under the stimulus of desires ... (It) is a necessary resultant of attachment to the past or to the anticipated future, and it always persists in some form or other until the mind is completely detached from everything.'' &lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''3'''. Sufism Reoriented. pp. 121-22. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
Worry system is activated from exposure of a potential triggering event, traumatic experience or vulnerability, this brings worrisome thoughts and feelings which bring about physical stress reactions and response to avoid worrisome behavior, to ensure [[allostasis]]. But under the crisis this activity feeds back into the first worrisome thoughts and feelings which generates and [[Conditioned emotional response|strengthens]] the vicious worry cycle. Relaxation, risk assessment, worry exposure and behavior prevention have been proven effective in curbing the excessive worry, a chief feature of generalized anxiety disorder.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, T. A., Brown, T. A., &amp; Barlow, D. H. (1992). The efficacy of worry control treatment in generalized anxiety disorder: A multiple baseline analysis. Association for Advancement of Behavior Therapy, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive behavioral techniques hasn't branched out enough to address the problem holistically but therapy can control or diminish worry.&lt;ref&gt;Zinbarg RE, Barlow DH, Brown TA, Hertz RM. Cognitive-behavioral approaches to the nature and treatment of anxiety disorders. Annu Rev Psychol. 1992;43:235-67.&lt;/ref&gt;
