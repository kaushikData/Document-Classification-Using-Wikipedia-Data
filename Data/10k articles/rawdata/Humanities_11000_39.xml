'''Achaemenid architecture''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: معماری هخامنشیان) includes all architectural achievements of the [[Achaemenid]] [[Persian people|Persians]] manifesting in construction of spectacular cities used for governance and inhabitation ([[Persepolis]], [[Susa]], [[Ecbatana]]), temples made for worship and social gatherings (such as [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] temples), and [[mausoleums]] erected in honor of fallen kings (such as the burial tomb of [[Cyrus the Great]]). The quintessential feature of Persian architecture was its eclectic nature with elements of Assyrian, Egyptian, Median and Asiatic Greek all incorporated, yet producing a unique Persian identity seen in the finished product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How to study architecture|author =Charles Henry Caffin|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company|year=1917|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnoWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achaemenid architecture is academically classified under [[Iranian architecture|Persian architecture]] in terms of its style and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dictionary of Iranian Traditional Architectural Terms (Persian: فرهنگ واژه‌های معماری سنتی ایران) |author=Fallah'far, Sa'id |publisher=Kamyab Publications |year=2010 |pages=44 |isbn=978-964-350-316-1 |url=http://lccn.loc.gov/2010342544 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713082632/http://lccn.loc.gov/2010342544 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achaemenid architectural heritage, beginning with the expansion of the empire around 550 B.C.E., was a period of artistic growth that left an extraordinary architectural legacy ranging from Cyrus the Great's solemn tomb in [[Pasargadae]] to the splendid structures of the opulent city of [[Persepolis]].&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Architecture|author =Marco Bussagli|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2005|page=211|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fMfCkY6-9joC&amp;pg=PA211|isbn=9781845110895}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of the [[Sassanid empire|second Persian Empire]], the [[Sassanid dynasty]] (224–624 C.E.), revived Achaemenid tradition by construction of temples dedicated to fire, and monumental palaces.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

Perhaps the most striking extant structures to date are the ruins of [[Persepolis]], a once opulent city established by the Achaemenid king, [[Darius the Great]] for governmental and ceremonial functions, and also acting as one of the empire's four capitals. Persepolis, would take 100 years to complete and would finally be ransacked and burnt by the troops of [[Alexander the Great]] in 330 B.C.E.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient cities: the archaeology of urban life in the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece and Rome|author =Charles Gates|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|pages=186|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8aLb5pnm1j4C&amp;pg=PA186|isbn=9780415121828}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar architectural infrastructures were also erected at [[Susa]] and [[Ecbatana]] by Darius the Great, serving similar functions as [[Persepolis]], such as reception of foreign dignitaries and delegates, performance of imperial ceremonies and duties, and also housing the kings.

==Pasargadae==

===Mausoleum of Cyrus the Great===
[[File:Pasargades cyrus cropped.jpg|thumb|Mausoleum of Cyrus the Great in [[Iran]]]]

[[File:CyrustheGreattombEdifice.jpg|right|thumb|Dimensions of the edifice and pediment roof, without the pyramidal stone structure]]

Despite having ruled over much of the ancient world, Cyrus the Great would design a tomb that depicts extreme simplicity and modesty when compared to those of other ancient kings and rulers. The simplicity of the structure has a powerful effect on the viewer, since aside from a few cyma moldings below the roof and a small rosette above its small entrance, there are no other stylistic distractions.&lt;ref name=ronald&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arts of Persia|author =Ronald W. Ferrier|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1989|pages=27–8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G2Qkf0h2Pj4C&amp;pg=PA27|isbn =0300039875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Structural details====
After his death, Cyrus the Great's remains were interred in his capital city of [[Pasargadae]], where today his [[limestone]] tomb (built around 540–530 B.C.E.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|title=Pasargadae|author =UNESCO World Heritage Centre|year=2006|accessdate=December 26, 2010|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1106}}&lt;/ref&gt;) still exists. The translated ancient accounts give a vivid description of the tomb both geometrically and aesthetically; The tomb's geometric shape has changed little over the years, still maintaining a large stone of quadrangular form at the base (forty five feet by forty two feet&lt;ref name=james&gt;{{cite book|title=The palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis restored: an essay on ancient Assyrian and Persian architecture, Volume 5|author =James Fergusson|publisher=J. Murray|year=1851|pages=214–216 &amp; 206–209 (Zoroaster Cube: pp. 206) |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Us0TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA215}}&lt;/ref&gt;), followed by a pyramidal succession of seven, irregular smaller rectangular stones (possibly as a reference to the seven planets&lt;ref name=james/&gt; of the [[solar system]]) reaching a height of eighteen feet, until the structure is curtailed by a rectangularly formed cubical edifice with a small opening or window on the side, where the slenderest man can barely squeeze through.&lt;ref name=Cleveland&gt;{{cite book|author =((Grk.) Lucius Flavius Arrianus) (En.) Arrian – (trans.) Charles Dexter Cleveland|title=A compendium of classical literature:comprising choice extracts translated from Greek and Roman writers, with biographical sketches|year=1861|publisher=Biddle|pages=313|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SaU1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roof of the edifice and indeed the structure, is an elongated limestone [[pediment]].&lt;ref name=james/&gt;

The edifice, or the "small house" is a rectangular, elongated cube that lies directly on top of the pyramidal stone steps, and is {{convert|6+1/2|ft|m|spell=in}} in width, {{convert|6+1/2|ft|m|spell=in}} in height, and {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref name=Aedeen&gt;{{cite book|title=Archaeologica: The World's Most Significant Sites and Cultural Treasures|author =Aedeen Cremin|publisher=frances lincoln Ltd|year=2007|pages=227–29|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A0llBlzF6UgC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227|isbn=9780711228221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inside of the edifice is occupied by a small chamber a few feet in width and height, and around ten feet deep. It was inside this chamber where the bed and coffin of Cyrus the Great would have been situated.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; The edifice has a pediment roof possessing the same length and width dimensions as the edifice itself. Around the tomb were a series of columns, the original structure which they supported is no longer present.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; [[Arrian]]'s direct testimony indicates that Cyrus the Great was indeed buried in the chamber inside the edifice, as he describes Alexander seeing it during his visit to Pasargadae, but it is also a possibility that the body of Cyrus the Great had been interred below the structure, and that the tomb seen on the top is in fact a [[cenotaph]] or a false tomb.

There was originally a golden [[coffin]] inside the mausoleum, resting on a table with golden supports, inside of which the body of Cyrus the Great was interred. Upon his resting place, was a covering of tapestry and drapes made from the best available Babylonian materials, using fine Median workmanship; below his bed was a fine red carpet, covering the narrow rectangular base of his tomb.&lt;ref name=Cleveland /&gt;

====History====
Translated Greek accounts describe the tomb as having been placed in the fertile Pasargadae gardens, surrounded by trees and ornamental shrubs, with a group of Achaemenian protectors (the "[[Magi]]"), stationed nearby to protect the edifice from theft or damage.&lt;ref name=Cleveland /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Persia past and present|author =Abraham Valentine Williams Jackson|year=1906|publisher=The Macmillan Company|pages=278|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7pdCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magi were a group of on-site Zoroastrian observers, located in their separate but attached structure possibly a [[caravanserai]], paid and cared for by the Achaemenid state (by some accounts they received a salary of daily bread and flour, and one sheep payment a day&lt;ref name=james/&gt;). The magi were placed in charge of maintenance and also prevention of theft. Years later, in the ensuing chaos created by [[Alexander the Great]]'s invasion of Persia and loss of a centralized authority directing and caring for the Magi, Cyrus the Great's tomb was broken into and most of its luxuries were looted. When Alexander reached the tomb, he was horrified by the manner in which the tomb was treated, and questioned the Magi and put them to court.&lt;ref name=Cleveland /&gt; On some accounts, Alexander's decision to put the Magi on trial was more about his attempt to undermine their influence and his show of power in his newly conquered empire, than a concern for Cyrus's tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Monthly review|author1=Ralph Griffiths |author2=George Edward Griffiths |publisher=Printers Street, London|year=1816|pages=509|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hogCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Alexander the Great ordered [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia]] to improve the tomb's condition and restore its interior.&lt;ref name=Cleveland /&gt;

The tomb was originally ornamented with an inscription that, according to [[Strabo]] (and other ancient sources), stated:&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt;

{{quote|O man! I am Cyrus the Great, who gave the Persians an empire and was the king of Asia. Grudge me not therefore this monument.}}

The edifice has survived the test of time for some 2,500 years. After the Arab invasion into Persia and collapse of the [[Sassanid Empire]], Arab armies wanted to destroy this historical artifact, on the basis that it was not in congruence to their Islamic tenets, but quick thinking on the part of the local Persians prevented this disaster. The Persians renamed the tomb, and presented it to the invading army as the tomb of King [[Solomon]]'s mother. It is likely that the inscription was lost at this time.&lt;ref name=elliot&gt;{{cite book|title=Iran|author1=Andrew Burke |author2=Mark Elliot |publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2008|pages=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] (Shah of Iran), the last official monarch of Persia, during his [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] paid significant homage to the Achaemenid kings and specially Cyrus the Great. Just as Alexander the Great before him, the Shah of Iran wanted to appeal to Cyrus's legacy to legitimize his own rule by extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =James D. Cockcroft|title=Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|year=1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiIEFLxZaJwC|isbn=9781555468477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shah of Iran however was generally interested in protection of imperial historical artifacts.

After the [[Iranian revolution]], the tomb of Cyrus the Great survived the initial chaos and vandalism propagated by the Islamic revolutionary hardliners who equated Persian imperial historical artifacts with the late Shah of Iran. There are allegations of the tomb being in danger of damage from the construction of the [[Sivand Dam]] on river Polvar (located in the province of [[Fars Province|Pars]]) and water related damage, but there is no official acknowledgement of this claim. [[United Nations]] recognizes the tomb of Cyrus the Great and Pasargadae as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] site.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;

Scholars agree that it was Darius the Great who initiated the construction and expansion of the Persepolis project, however German archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld|Ernst E. Herzfeld]], believed that it was Cyrus the Great who chose the site for the construction, although it ultimately came down to Darius the Great to finish the construction and create its impressive buildings. Excavations on behalf of the Oriental Institute of [[Chicago University]], headed by Herzfeld in 1931 and later cooperation by Eric F. Schmidt in 1933 led to some of the most impressive uncovering of Achaemenid artifacts, palaces, and structures. Herzfeld felt that the site of Persepolis was made for special ceremonies and was meant to convey the power of the Achaemenid empire to its subject nations.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt;

On some accounts, Persepolis was never officially finished as its existence was cut short by Alexander the Great, who in a fit of anger, ordered the burning of the city in 330 B.C.E. Started originally by Darius the Great a century earlier, the structure was constantly changing, receiving upgrades from subsequent Persian monarchs, and undergoing renovation to maintain its impressive façade. After the burning of the city, Persepolis was deserted and it was relatively lost to history until the excavations of Herzfeld, Schmidt, and the Chicago team uncovered it in the 1930s. This great historical artifact is unfortunately at serious risk of "irreparable damage"&lt;ref name=book/&gt; from neglect, the elements, and vandalism.

Persepolis was by no means the only large scale Achaemenid project, as [[Susa]] also hosted [[Palace of Darius in Susa|a similar structure]] initiated by Darius for similar ceremonial purposes. However, that history is able to enjoy the remains of Persepolis as opposed to meager remnants of Susa, owes partly to selection of stone in construction of Persepolis over mud-brick in Susa, and the fact that it had been relatively uninhabited, protecting it from wear and tear of inhabitants. Politically, Persepolis also was a significant find because nearby discovery of [[Naqsh-e Rustam]], the Persian necropolis home to Darius the Great shed light on the significance it has had as one of the major capitals of the empire.&lt;ref name=ronald/&gt; Naqsh-e Rustam would not only house Darius the Great, but also his son [[Xerxes the Great]], [[Artaxerxes I]], and [[Darius II]] as well. The necropolis complex was looted following invasion of Alexander, and possibly in the Sassanid period and during the Arab invasion.

During the time of [[Shah of Iran]], the structure enjoyed protection and coverage as Mohammad Reza Shah appeased to its royal and national symbolism. During this time period many western politicians, poets, artists, and writers were gravitated to Iran, and Persepolis, either as a function of the political relations with the Iranian monarchy or to report on, or visit the ruins. Such figures include the procession of international dignitaries attending the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] held by Shah, as well as individual visits by such figures as [[Heinrich Lübke]] of Germany, and [[Ralph Graves (writer)|Ralph Graves]] of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. In an article in ``Life`` in 1971, Graves describes his experience at Persepolis in the following way:

{{quote|When you see Persepolis for the first time as I did, facing Marvdasht, you are likely to be disappointed but once inside the ruins themselves you are overwhelmed by the still-proud soaring columns, and by the quality and the fresh state of the bas-relief carvings which are certainly among the finest in the history of the world’s art. But mostly you are transfixed by the sudden realization that all this happened 24 centuries ago, and that people from every nation in the known world of the time had stood in the same place and felt the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A stunning setting for a 2500th anniversary|author =Ralph Graves|publisher=Life magazine|date=October 15, 1971|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Four-winged guardian===

[[File:Pasargades winged man.jpg|left|thumb|The four winged guardian figure of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], with four wings, a two horned crown, and a royal Elamite clothing]]
Perhaps one of the most memorable remaining architectural and artistic works is the bas-relief of Cyrus the Great in Pasargadae. This is a bas-relief cut upon a stone slab depicting a figure or a guardian man, most likely a resemblance of Cyrus himself, possessing four wings shown in an [[Assyria]]n style, dressed in [[Elam]]ite traditional clothing, assuming a pose and figure of an [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] god, and wearing a crown that has two horns, in what resembles an ''[[Ovis longipes palaeoaegyptiacus]].'' The structure originally had an upper stone slab that in three different languages, ([[Old Persian]], [[Elamite]], [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]]) declared, "I, (am) Cyrus the king, an Achaemenid."&lt;ref name=ilya&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge history of Iran: The Median and Achaemenian periods, Volume 2|author = Ilya Gershevitch|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|pages=392–398|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kMLKgzj5afMC&amp;pg=PA392|isbn = 9780521200912}}&lt;/ref&gt; This carved in limestone writing was in place when [[Robert Ker Porter|Sir Robert Ker Poter]] described the piece in 1818 but, at some point has been lost.

[[David Stronach]] has suggested that there were originally four such figures, set against doorways to the Palace of Cyrus in Pasargadae.&lt;ref name=ilya/&gt; That this bas-relief has such an eclectic styling with elements of [[ancient egypt|Egyptian]], [[Elam]]ite, and [[Assyria]]n, reflects "..'the oecumenical attitude of the Achaemenian kings, who from the time of Cyrus, onward adopted a liberal policy of tolerance and conciliation toward the various religions embraced within their empire'..."&lt;ref name=ilya/&gt; It would therefore depict the eclectic nature of Achaemenid life from policies of the kings to their choice of architecture.

[[Herodotus]], recounts that Cyrus saw in his sleep the oldest son of Hystaspes, [Darius the Great] with wings upon his shoulders, shadowing with the one wing Asia, and with the other wing Europe.&lt;ref name=ilya/&gt; Noted [[Iranologist]], [[Ilya Gershevitch]] explains this statement by Herodotus and its connection with the four winged figure in the following way:&lt;ref name=ilya/&gt;

{{quote|Herodotus, therefore as I surmise, may have known of the close connection, between this type of winged figure, and the image of the Iranian majesty, which he associated with a dream prognosticating, the king's death, before his last, fatal campaign across the Oxus.}}

This relief sculpture, in a sense depicts the eclectic inclusion of various art forms by the Achaemenids, yet their ability to create a new synthetic form that is uniquely Persian in style, and heavily dependent on the contributions of their subject states. After all, that is what distinguishes Achaemenid architecture from those of other kingdoms. It is its originality in context of fusion and inclusion of existing styles, in such a way as to create awe-inspiring structures.

[[Persepolis]] is the Latinized version of the Old Persian name, "Parsa" literally meaning the "city of Persians." Another spectacular achievement of the Achaemenids, Persepolis became one of the four capitals of the empire. Initiated by [[Darius the Great]] around 518 B.C.E., it would grow to become a center for ceremonial and cultural festivities, a center for dignitaries and visitors to pay homage to the king, a private residence for the Persian kings, a place for [[satraps]] to bring gifts for the king in the Spring during the festival of [[Nowruz]], as well as a place of governance and ordinance.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; Persepolis's prestige and grand riches were well known in the ancient world, and it was best described by the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] as "the richest city under the sun".&lt;ref name=ronald/&gt;

Today the archaeological remnants of this once opulent city are about 70 kilometers northeast of the modern Iranian city of [[Shiraz]], in the [[Fārs Province|Pars]] province, in southwestern [[Iran]]. Persepolis is a wide, elevated complex 40 feet high, 100 feet wide, and a third of a mile long,&lt;ref name=book/&gt; composed of multiple halls, corridors, a wide terrace, and a special, double, symmetrical stairway that would provide access to the top of the terrace.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; The stairway would delineate [[relief]] scenes of various motifs of daily life or nature, including some that were literal as well as metaphorical; Some scenes would show natural acts such as a lion attacking its prey but bear symbolism of spring and the [[Nowruz]] festival. Other scenes would depict, subjects from all states of the empire presenting gifts to the king, as well as scenes depicting royal guards, or scenes of social interactions between the guards or the dignitaries.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; This stairway is sometimes referred to as "All countries."&lt;ref name=gov/&gt;

The structure was constructed from various halls and complexes that included, hall of [[Apadana]] (the largest hall with 36 columns), "Tachar" (the private chamber of Darius the Great), "Hadish" (added later on as a private chamber for king [[Xerxes the Great]]), the "Talar-i-Takht" also known as the 100-columned hall serving as the throne hall for general meeting with the king, "Darvazeh-i-Mellal" (the gate of all nations), the "khazaneh" (the royal treasury), a hall/palace complex later on developed by [[Artaxerxes III]], Tripylon (council hall), and the "rock cut tombs of the kings" or [[Naqsh-e Rustam]].&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt;

The most impressive hall in the complex is the [[Apadana]] hall, occupying an area of about 109 square meters with 36 [[Persian column]]s, each more than 19 m tall. Each column is [[Fluting (architecture)|fluted]], with a square base (except a few in the [[porticos]]), and an elaborate [[capital (column)|capital]] with two animals supporting the roof. The structure was originally closed off from the elements by mud-brick walls over 5 meters thick and over 20 meters.&lt;ref name=stronach&gt;{{cite web|title=APADANA|author1=R. Schmitt |author2=D. Stronach |publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica|date=December 15, 1986|accessdate=Jan 23, 2011|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/apadana}}&lt;/ref&gt; The columns have a composite capital depicting addorsed bulls or creatures. Those columns in the porticoes not only would possess a circular base, but would also have an ornate capital after the end of the fluting, only to be curtailed by detailed addorsed bulls, supporting the roof.&lt;ref name=stronach/&gt;

Apadana's relief is also unique in that it delineates the presence and power of the king. Known as "Treasure reliefs" the depicted scenes on Apadana stress the continuity of the kingdom through Darius the Great, and stress his presence throughout the empire, as well as depict his army of Persian [[Immortals (Persian Empire)|immortals]]. Perhaps this was Darius's attempt to create a symbol of the assured continuity of his line. Apadana hall and the adjacent structures in the complex are believed to have been designed to host large number of people. In fact, halls of Persepolis could at any one time host some ten thousand visitors easily with the king and the royal staff seated appropriately.&lt;ref name=stronach/&gt;

The grandeur of Persepolis is in its architectural details, its impressive, tall, and upright columns, in its skilfully crafted reliefs depicting people from all walks of life, and from all corners of the empire, and most importantly in its historical importance as both a political and a social center of Achaemenid royal life.

===Engineering===
[[Persepolis Administrative Archives|Persepolis Fortifications]] (PF) Tablets, dating to between 509 and 494 B.C.E. are ancient Persian documents that describe many aspects of construction and maintenance of the Persepolis.&lt;ref name=george/&gt; The tablets are important because they highlight two important aspects of the Achaemenid life and the construction of Persepolis: Firstly, that the structure was created by workers, who were paid rations or wages, and secondly the structure had an intricate system of engineering involving weight bearing and architectural elements, and most notably an irrigation system composed of a system of closed pipes and open aqueducts. The following text from ''PF 1224'', delineates both points:

{{quote|32 BAN (9.7 litres) of grain...the high priest at Persepolis... received and gave (it as) bonus to post-partum Greek women at Persepolis, irrigation (workers), whose apportionment are set...."&lt;ref name=george&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford handbook of Hellenic studies|author1=George Boys-Stones |author2=Barbara Graziosi |author3=Phiroze Vasunia |publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2009|pages=42–47|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cIDDR1WD9iEC&amp;pg=PA42|isbn=9780199286140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Water technologies====
The runoff and sewer network of Persepolis are among the most complex in the ancient world. Persepolis is constructed on the foot of a mountain (Rahmat Mountain), with an elevated terrace that is partially man made and partially part of the mountain complex. As Persepolis was in essence an important cultural center often used by the beginning of the spring during the festival of [[Nowruz]] it enjoyed great precipitation and water runoffs from the molten ice and snow. The sewer network assumed great importance at this critical time as it was meant to both handle the water flow downward from higher areas as well as manage the inhabitant’s sewage runoffs, and their water needs.&lt;ref name=Mays&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Water Technologies|author1=L. Mays |author2=M. Moradi-Jalal et. al |publisher=Springer|year=2010|pages=95–100|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AEzOzSZEAToC&amp;pg=PA94|isbn=9789048186327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to prevent flooding, the Achaemenids used two engineering techniques to divert molten snow and mountain runoff: The first strategy was to collect the runoff in a reservoir that was a well with a square opening with dimensions of 4.2 m for the square opening, and a depth of 60 m, allowing a volume of 554 cubic meters, or 554,000 liters, (60 x 4.2 x 4.2) of runoff to be collected. The water would be diverted toward the reservoir via multiple masonry gutters strategically located around the structure. The second strategy was to divert water away from the structure, should the reservoirs be filled to capacity; this system used a 180 m long conduit, with 7 m width, and 2.6 m depth located just west of the site.&lt;ref name=Mays/&gt;

The water system however was far more complex than just the reservoirs and the water conduits and involved a very sophisticated ancient system of closed pipes and irrigation. The irrigation was divided into five zones, two serving north part of the structure and three the southern part. Amazingly the irrigation system was designed to be harmonious with the structure so that at places there were central drainage canals in the center of the columns and small draining holes and conduits on each floor that would take the water out of roof, each floor, and the sewage portals into an underground sewage network and away from the structure.&lt;ref name=Mays/&gt;

The five zones (I–V) all possessed a runoff capacity of 260 L/s (liter/second) which is certainly more than the amount needed for handling mountain runoff indicating that the system was also used for water supply to the inhabitants, sewage management, and even irrigation of the gardens around the structure.&lt;ref name=Mays/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Structural technologies====
In order for such a massive structure to have functioned properly it meant that the weight of the roof, columns and indeed the terrace had to be distributed evenly. Construction at the base of the mountain offered some structural support. The ceiling material was a composite application of wood and stone decreasing its overall weight. Extensive use of stone in Persepolis, not only guaranteed its structural integrity for the duration of its use but also meant that its remains lasted longer than the mud-bricks of [[Palace of Darius in Susa|Susa palaces]].

===History===
Scholars agree that it was Darius the Great who initiated the construction and expansion of the Persepolis project, however German archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld|Ernst E. Herzfeld]], believed that it was Cyrus the Great who chose the site for the construction, although it ultimately came down to Darius the Great to finish the construction and create its impressive buildings. Excavations on behalf of the Oriental Institute of [[Chicago University]], headed by Herzfeld in 1931 and later cooperation by Eric F. Schmidt in 1933 led to some of the most impressive uncovering of Achaemenid artifacts, palaces, and structures. Herzfeld felt that the site of Persepolis was made for special ceremonies and was meant to convey the power of the Achaemenid empire to its subject nations.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt;

On some accounts, Persepolis was never officially finished as its existence was cut short by Alexander the Great, who in a fit of anger, ordered the burning of the city in 330 B.C.E. Started originally by Darius the Great a century earlier, the structure was constantly changing, receiving upgrades from subsequent Persian monarchs, and undergoing renovation to maintain its impressive façade. After the burning of the city, Persepolis was deserted and it was relatively lost to history until the excavations of Herzfeld, Schmidt, and the Chicago team uncovered it in the 1930s. This great historical artifact is unfortunately at serious risk of "irreparable damage"&lt;ref name=book/&gt; from neglect, the elements, and vandalism.

Persepolis was by no means the only large scale Achaemenid project, as [[Susa]] also hosted a similar structure initiated by Darius for similar ceremonial purposes. However, that history is able to enjoy the remains of Persepolis as opposed to meager remnants of Susa, owes partly to selection of stone in construction of Persepolis over mud-brick in Susa, and the fact that it had been relatively uninhabited, protecting it from wear and tear of inhabitants. Politically, Persepolis also was a significant find because nearby discovery of [[Naqsh-e Rustam]], the Persian necropolis home to Darius the Great shed light on the significance it has had as one of the major capitals of the empire.&lt;ref name=ronald/&gt; Naqsh-e Rustam would not only house Darius the Great, but also his son [[Xerxes the Great]], [[Artaxerxes I]], and [[Darius II]] as well. The necropolis complex was looted following invasion of Alexander, and possibly in the Sassanid period and during the Arab invasion.

During the time of [[Shah of Iran]], the structure enjoyed protection and coverage as Mohammad Reza Shah appeased to its royal and national symbolism. During this time period many western politicians, poets, artists, and writers were gravitated to Iran, and Persepolis, either as a function of the political relations with the Iranian monarchy or to report on, or visit the ruins. Such figures include the procession of international dignitaries attending the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] held by Shah, as well as individual visits by such figures as [[Heinrich Lübke]] of Germany, and [[Ralph Graves (writer)|Ralph Graves]] of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. In an article in ``Life`` in 1971, Graves describes his experience at Persepolis in the following way:

{{quote|When you see Persepolis for the first time as I did, facing Marvdasht, you are likely to be disappointed but once inside the ruins themselves you are overwhelmed by the still-proud soaring columns, and by the quality and the fresh state of the bas-relief carvings which are certainly among the finest in the history of the world’s art. But mostly you are transfixed by the sudden realization that all this happened 24 centuries ago, and that people from every nation in the known world of the time had stood in the same place and felt the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A stunning setting for a 2500th anniversary|author =Ralph Graves|publisher=Life magazine|date=October 15, 1971|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AUAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Vandalism===
Throughout history there have been instances of neglect or vandalism in Persepolis. The most notable historical figure to vandalize this structure was [[Alexander the Great]], who after entering Persepolis in 330 B.C.E. called it the "most hateful city in Asia" and allowed his Macedonian troops to pillage it.&lt;ref name=Laura&gt;{{cite book|title=Alexander the conqueror: the epic story of the warrior king, Volume 2003|author =Laura Foreman|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2004|pages=152|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rVEa4nzLkT4C&amp;pg=PA152|isbn =9780306812934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this stern hatred, Alexander also admired the Persians as is obvious through his respect for [[Cyrus the Great]], and his act of giving a dignified burial to [[Darius III]]. Years later upon revisiting the city he had burnt, Alexander would regret his action. [[Plutarch]] depicts the paradoxical nature of Alexander when he recounts an anecdote in which Alexander pauses and talks to a fallen statue of [[Xerxes the Great]] as if it were a live person:

{{quote|Shall I pass by and leave you lying there because of the expeditions you led against Greece, or shall I set you up again because of your magnanimity and your virtues in other respects?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alexander the Great: The Invisible Enemy: A Biography |first=John Maxwell |last=O'Brien |publisher=Psychology Press |date=1994 |page=104 |isbn=978-0-415-10617-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In retrospect, it must be understood that despite his momentary lapse of judgment and his role as having been the single most significant figure to bring an end to Persepolis, Alexander is not by any means the only. Many individuals in the following centuries would damage Persepolis including thieves and vandals during the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid era]]. When the Arab armies invaded in the seventh century, they took to causing civil disturbances, religious persecution of Persians, and burning of the books. That no clear record of their vandalism remains to date, is most likely due to their destruction of books and historical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Zoroastrian faith: tradition and modern research|author =Solomon Alexander Nigosian|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=1993|pages=47–48|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Uspf6eDDvjAC&amp;pg=PA47|isbn =9780773511446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial era, and in WWII, the structure would also suffer vandalism at the hands of the Allies. Natural causes such as earthquakes and winds have also contributed to the overall demise of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Persian Earthquakes|author1=N. N. Ambraseys |author2=C. P. Melville |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|pages=198|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1JkfKub5vakC&amp;pg=PA198|isbn=9780521021876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first French excavation in Susa carried out by the Dieulafoys and the looting and the destruction of Persian antiquities by the so-called archeologists had a deep impact on the site. Jane Dieulafoy writes in her diary:

{{quote| Yesterday I was gazing at the huge stone cow found recently; it weighs around 12,000 kilos! It is impossible to move such an enormous mass. I couldn't control my anger. I took a hammer and started striking the stone beast. I gave it some ferocious blows. The head of the pillar burst open like ripe fruit.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}}}

Even to date the structure is not safe from destruction and vandalism. After the Iranian revolution, a group of fundamentalists serving [[Khomeini]], including his right-hand man [[Sadegh Khalkhali]], tried to bulldoze both the renown Persian poet, [[Tomb of Ferdowsi|Ferdowsi's tomb]], and Persepolis, but they were stopped by the provisional government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Epic of Iran|author =Reza Aslan|publisher=New York Times|date=April 30, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/books/review/30aslan.html?pagewanted=print|accessdate=Jan 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery below highlights only some of these unfortunate acts of vandalism mostly by foreign visitors from the late 1800s to mid-1900s. Currently the structure is at high risk of "irreparable damage."&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Virtual reconstruction===
French archaeologist, Egyptologist, and historian [[Charles Chipiez]] (1835–1901) has created some of the most advanced virtual drawings of what [[Persepolis]] would have looked like as a metropolis of the Persian Empire. The following mini-gallery depicts his virtual recreations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of art in Persia|author1=Georges Perrot |author2=Charles Chipiez |publisher=Chapman and Hall, limited|year=1892|pages=336–43 &amp; others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SU9TAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA314-IA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first image on the left is a view of the "Talar-i-Takht" or the 100 columns hall of Persepolis. Note on the far left portion of the image, the famous "[[lamassu]]" (or chimeric man, lion, eagle beast) greeting the visitors (look below for a picture of a lamassu). Chipiez's drawings delineate his technical prowess and attention to details.

The second picture from the left, is Chipiez's drawing of the columns, their [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] ornation, and roof structure of the palace of Darius in Persepolis, also known as "Tachar." Note the adorsed bull details, as well as the use of wood in construction of the roof. This explains why the palace caught fire when Alexander the Great, set it aflame.

The third picture from the left, is a more detailed, technical drawing of the "Talar-i-Takht" or the 100 column hall. Note the layering of the roof, the detailing on the edges of the roof, the window structures, and the technical detailing of the construction poles.

The last picture, on the right, is a panoramic view of the outside of the palace of Darius the Great in Persepolis. Details of the Persepolis reliefs are depicted as one can note the symbolic scenes of lions attacking bulls, accompanied by two groups of Persian soldiers protecting (symbolically in this case) the infrastructure above.

[[Susa]] was an ancient city (5500 B.C.E) even by the time of the Achaemenids. Susa became a part of the Achaemenid Empire in 539 B.C.E., and was expanded upon by Darius the Great with construction of Palace of Darius, and later development of palace of [[Artaxerxes II]]. The palace had a unique Apadana, resembling the one in Persepolis, except this hall was much larger than its Persepolis counterpart covering some 9,200 square meters.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Cyrus the Great chose Susa as a site for one of his fortifications creating a wall there that was significantly taller than older walls made by the Elamites. This choice might have been to facilitate the trade from [[Persian Gulf]] northward.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; What remains in way of structure from this once active capital, are five archaeological mounds, today located in modern Shush, in southwestern Iran, scattered over 250 hectares.&lt;ref name=man&gt;{{cite book|title=Eerdmans dictionary of the Bible|author1=David Noel Freedman |author2=Allen C. Myers |author3=Astrid B. Beck |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|year=2000|pages=1258|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P9sYIRXZZ2MC&amp;pg=PA1258|isbn=9780802824004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural details===
Darius's design of his palace in Susa would resemble Persepolis structurally and aesthetically but would incorporate more of a local flair. The structure hosted a large hall of throne or ''Apadana'' similar to the [[Apadana]] of the Persepolis. This Susa version of Apadana would be composed of three [[porticoes]] at right angles to each other, one of which was closed in all three sides by the walls, and only open in its southward direction. The palace was decorated with reliefs in enameled terra-cotta of lions walking.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Intricate scenes depicting archers of king Darius would decorate the walls, as well as motifs of nature such as double-bulls, unicorns, [[fasciae]] curling into volutes, and palms disposed as a flower or a bell. The archers in particular depict a unique symbiosis of Persian, Ionian and Greek artistry of the time probably reflecting the origin of the artists who were originally hired by Darius the Great, and their personal reflections on the finished work.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Perhaps the most striking terra-cotta relief is that of the [[griffin]], depicting a winged creature resembling a lion with wings of an eagle (picture not shown here). The terra-cotta brick reliefs were decorated with lively dye colorations often giving them a lifelike quality.

===History===
Architecturally, the palace of Darius in Susa, was the epitome of the Persian architecture at the height of the empire's growth. Originally erected by Darius, and extensively renovated and modified by [[Artaxerxes II]], it was meant to reflect the same opulence and prestige as Persepolis. This was Darius the Great's attempt to decorate his summer capital of Susa and to show case its glory. French archaeologist [[Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy]] discovered the remnants of the palace of Darius, among the ruins of Susa producing the artifacts of this once magnificent structure now at display in the [[Louvre]] museum, France. He also wrote a series of architectural observations known as "''L'Art antique de la Perse''" which made a significant impression on the art community as to the intricacy of the Achaemenid architecture.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Art|author = Giulio Carotti|publisher=Duckworth &amp; Co|year=1908|pages=94–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-JLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dieulafoy and his wife Jane, made significant contributions in way of excavation, Susa remains were noted by many observers years before and were in fact officially noted by [[William Loftus|William K. Loftus]] in 1852.&lt;ref name=man/&gt;

Susa was a wealthy city by the time Alexander the Great invaded it, and it is said that he required 10,000 camels and 20,000 donkeys to carry away the treasures.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; For the most part the architectural wealth of Susa lies in its palaces, and ceremonial structures most of which have been eroded away by time or wear and tear. Today the most important remnants of the Achaemenid contribution to the architecture of ancient Susa are found in remnants of the Palace of Darius the Great in the original excavation site, or hosted in foreign nations' museums as Persian artifacts. Today the archaeological remains of the structure remain exposed to the elements, wear and tear, and human activity, and it seems that remains of Susa would be forever lost to the humankind, except perhaps for few selected pieces on display at the Louvre or foreign nations' museums.

Below are a few selected photos from the palace of Darius. The photo on the far left depicts the famous Archers' relief from the palace of Darius, from Susa. The second picture from the right, is a two-dimensional "[[lamassu]]" a mythical creature with wings of an eagle, head of a man, and body of a lion. The picture in the middle, is of the base of a column from the palace of Darius in Susa, inscribing in its rim, in three languages (Babylonian, Elamite, and Old Persian), that Darius, is the "great king of kings."

==Naqsh-e Rustam==
[[File:Naghsh-e rostam, Irán, 2016-09-24, DD 20-24 PAN.jpg|thumb|900 px|center|&lt;center&gt;A panorama of the [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] mountain complex&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[Naqsh-e Rustam]] is an archaeological site located about 6 kilometers to the northwest of [[Persepolis]] in Marvdasht region in the Fars province of Iran.&lt;ref name=garthwaite&gt;{{cite book|title=The Persians|author =Gene Ralph Garthwaite|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2005|pages=51–55|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FqzrZ3b8aakC&amp;pg=PA51|isbn=9781405144001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nash-e Rustam acts as a [[necropolis]] for the Achaemenid kings, but is a significant historical entity in that it also housed ancient [[Elamite]] relief, as well as later relief by the [[Sassanid empire|Sassanid]] kings. Naqsh-e Rustam is not the actual name of this massive structure, but is the [[New Persian]] compound word composed of "Naqsh" meaning "face", or "facade", and "[[Rostam|Rustam]]" referring to the hero of the Persian epic [[Shahnameh]]. The [[Elamite]]s, [[Achaemenid]]s, and the [[Sassanid]]s lived centuries before the drafting of the Shahnameh by the Persian poet [[Ferdowsi]], and therefore the name is a misnomer, the result of the great amnesia of Persians about their ancient past, that settled over them after being conquered by the Arabs.&lt;ref name=paul&gt;{{cite book|title=In Search of Zarathustra: Across Iran and Central Asia to Find the World's First Prophet|author =Paul Kriwaczek|publisher=Random House, Inc|year=2004|pages=88–90|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YQ_yENnMpKQC&amp;pg=PA88|isbn=9780307426352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name therefore is a retrospective creation, due to lack of historical documents and lack of any inclusive knowledge of its origin. In ancient Persia, this structure would overlook the now long gone city of [[Istakhr]] easily accessible from Persepolis. Istakhr had a religious role as it was the place where Achaemenids held their reverence of the water goddess [[Anahita]]. The structure is carved into a native limestone rock mountain, and houses the burial chambers of [[Darius the Great]], [[Xerxes I]], [[Artaxerxes I]], and [[Darius II]], all Achaemenid monarchs of Persia. There is also an incomplete tomb, as only its lower cruciform arm is carved out of the rock, while the rest is unfinished. It is speculated to belong to king [[Darius III]].&lt;ref name=garthwaite/&gt;&lt;ref name=paul/&gt;

The kings were interred behind a facade and [[rock relief]], that would resemble an accurate depiction of the king's own palace and its structural details. The accuracy of the facade and its association with the actual structure of the kings' palaces is so close that they almost produce a view of how the structures would have looked before time reduced them to remains; Tomb of Darius the Great, for instance mirrors his palace in [[Persepolis]], the "Tachar" even in scale and dimensions.&lt;ref name=paul/&gt;

The tombs are carved into the mountain's side, in form of a cross ([[Old Persian]]: ''chalipa''), depressed into the mountain's [[limestone]] background, and elevated from the ground. The relief which is found in the depressed cruciform is that which depicts the respective king's palace, and also depicts on its roof, the relief figure of the king praying, to [[Ahuramazda]] or what most believe is a reference to the [[Zoroastrian]] icon, [[Faravahar]].&lt;ref name=paul/&gt;

One of the enigmatic features of the complex is a cubical, stone structure standing 12.5 meters tall, and around 7 meters wide, called the "[[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]]" translating to the "Cube of [[Zoroaster]]" believed to have been constructed during the Acahemenid era and modified and changed during the Sassanid era. The structure is cubical in base, with blind impressions on the side resembling windows, and a ruined staircase leading to a small door in the front leading to a completely empty interior.&lt;ref name=garthwaite/&gt;&lt;ref name=paul/&gt; There are varied speculations as to its function discussed below.

The structure also once housed an ancient Elamite relief which has been almost entirely replaced by the Sassanid reliefs. Today but a figure of a man remains of the Elamite contribution to this mountain. The later Sassanids, also created their own historical signature on the structure, called the [[Naqsh-e Rajab]]. Though numerous and very detailed, the study of the [[Sassanid architecture|Sassanid architectural]] achievements sheds light on some of the architectural achievements during the second Persian empire's reign.

===Ka'ba-ye Zartosht===
[[File:Tour nagsh-e-rostam iran.jpg|thumb|left|A close up view of the [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]] ("Cube of Zoroaster") showing the stairs, the narrow opening, and the blind windows. Note its placement in a depression, as well as the unique rectangular markings on the façade]]

This enigmatic structure stands erect around 12.5 meters tall (~ 35 feet), with a linear, cubical shape and a square base (~ 22 feet in sides),&lt;ref name=james/&gt; constructed in what is essentially a dug out rectangular depression, having on all but one of its sides, four rectangular depressions resembling blind windows, and multiple minute rectangular depressions in the façade interdispersed among the blind windows as well as the side housing the staircase. The staircase leads to a small door (5 feet by 6 feet in dimensions) opening to an interior apartment of about 12 feet square.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; The structure's roof houses a minimal [[entablature]] of a repeating square pattern.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; The entire structure is posited on a raised stone platform that is composed of a few stone slabs, in a sequentially smaller yet in a concentric, pyramidally shaped succession. This structure is enigmatic, both in its aesthetic choice seen in its rather odd design, and façade, as well as its location, and supposed function.

From one perspective, its proximity to the kings' tombs, and its simple design, is by some scholars thought to indicate that the cube was a Zoroastrian temple, and the Naqsh-e Rustam was more than a mere place for grieving of the deceased kings, but a grand festive center where crowds would gather on festive days to observe the king pray to [[Ahuramazda]], and bask in the structure's magnitude while praying to Ahuramazda.&lt;ref name=paul/&gt; This would certainly be logical as the city was also adjacent to [[Istakhr]], a major religious and cultural center. The concept of the temple being used as a fire sanctuary, is however not likely because there is no general ventilation for smoke and gasses, and also that it differs so drastically, architecturally and aesthetically from other well known contemporary temple sites in [[Fars province|Pars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pasargadae: the oldest imperial capital|author =Ali Sami|publisher=Musavi Printing Office|year=1956|pages=90–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjUbAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curiously the design although unique, is not the only one of its kind. Located not far away from the Cube of Zoroaster, there exists in [[Pasargadae]], even to date, remnants of a structure that is very similar in its square shape and design to the "''Cube of Zoroaster''", called "''Zendan-i-Suleiman''."&lt;ref name=james/&gt; The name "Zendan-i-Suleiman,"  is a compound word composed of the words, "Zendan" which is Persian for "jail", and "Suleiman" which is a local Persian dialect name of the King [[Solomon]], translating to ''"Jail of Solomon."'' Structurally both "Jail of Solomon" and "Cube of Zoroaster" have the same cubic shape, and even resemble each other in the most minute of details, including facade, and dimensions. The name "Jail of Solomon" is of course a misnomer since Solomon never did erect this structure. The term must have come as a result of a Persian tactic advised by local Persians, to protect both [[Cyrus the Great]]'s [[Tomb of Cyrus|tomb]], and the surrounding structures including this temple, from invading Arabs' destruction, by calling the mausoleum, the "tomb of Solomon's mother" and the temple in Pasargadae, the "Jail of Solomon."&lt;ref name=elliot/&gt;

Just like the "Cube of Zoroaster", the function of the "Solomon's Jail" is not well understood. There are theories about the structures being used as a depository of objects of dynastic or religious importance as well as theories of it being a temple of fire.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; It should also be noted, that the structures as they exist today are not simply the work of the Achaemenid architects and have been modified, and improved by the Sassanids, who also used them for their festive, and political needs.

==Behistun inscription==
[[File:Darius I the Great's inscription.jpg|left|thumb|[[Behistun inscription]]]]

Carved high in [[Mount Behistun]] of [[Kermanshah]], one can find the Behistun inscription, a text etched into the stone of the mountain describing the manner in which Darius became the king of Persia, after the previous ruler ([[Cambyses II]]), and how he overthrew the [[magus]] usurper of the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The journal of sacred literature and Biblical record, Volume 3|author1=John Kitto |author2=Henry Burgess |author3=Benjamin Harris Cowper |publisher=A. Heylin|year=1856|pages=183–5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qHUtAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this inscription Darius also details his [[satraps]] and delineates his position as the king and emperor of the Persian empire.

Architecturally speaking, the Behistun inscription is a massive project, that entailed cutting into the rough edge of the mountain in order to create [[bas-relief]] figures as seen in the pictures above. The Behistun mountain, rises up to some 1700 feet as part of the [[Zagros]] mountain chains in [[Iran]]. The mountain's location is ideal being close to both [[Ecbatana]] and [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; The bas-relief itself is located some 300 feet above the base of the mountain. The figures represent two of the king's soldiers, the king himself standing over a fallen usurper and captives of several nations possibly dissidents, or co-conspirators. The inscription itself is written in [[cuneiform]] character in [[Old Persian]], [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]], and [[Medes|Median]].&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of the world from the earliest records to the present time: ancient history, Volume 1|author =Philip Smith|publisher=[[D. Appleton &amp; Company|D. Appleton]] |year=1865|page=298|url=https://books.google.com/?id=elAPAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription is interpreted and deciphered with the help of many intellectuals and scholars, but the [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] [[Sir Henry Rawlinson]] is credited as being most critical in the process of deciphering the piece.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Part of why the understanding of the text is so vivid today is owed to Darius the Great himself, for he wrote the message of the inscription in three language, and so allowed the modern scholars to decipher one language and follow through the other two, since the message was essentially similar in all three forms. In this sense, the Behistun inscription is not only a significant architectural work, but also a significant linguistic tool, as important to the old world understanding of [[ancient Persia]] and its languages, as [[Rosetta Stone]] is to understanding [[ancient Egypt]] and its languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Darius the Great|author =J. Poolos|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2008|pages=38–9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K0EZK08VGXEC&amp;pg=PA38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and influences==
Elements of the Achaemenid style can be seen in contemporary [[Iranian architecture]]. Buildings built by the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], in particular, show extensive influence of Achaemenid architecture and art.

The term '''Afroasiatic ''Urheimat''''' refers to the hypothetical place where speakers of the [[proto-Afroasiatic language]] lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into separate distinct languages. This speech area is known as the ''[[Urheimat]]'' ("original homeland" in [[German language|German]]). [[Afroasiatic languages]] are today distributed in parts of Africa and [[Western Asia]].

The contemporary Afroasiatic languages are spoken in the [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and parts of the [[Sahara]]/[[Sahel]]. The various hypotheses for the Afroasiatic ''Urheimat'' are distributed throughout this territory;&lt;ref name="Blench_2006"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Blench R | year = 2006 | title = Archaeology, Language, and the African Past | publisher = AltaMira Press | isbn = 978-0-7591-0466-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=esFy3Po57A8C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ehret2004&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ehret C, Keita SO, Newman P | title = The origins of Afroasiatic | journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue = 5702 | pages = 1680.3–1680 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15576591 | doi = 10.1126/science.306.5702.1680c }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bender1997&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Bender ML | year =1997 | chapter = Upside Down Afrasian | title = Afrikanistische Arbeitspapiere 50 | pages = 19–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=militarev2005&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Militarev A | year = 2005 | chapter = Once more about glottochronology and comparative method: the Omotic-Afrasian case, Аспекты компаративистики - 1 (Aspects of comparative linguistics - 1).

However, there is argument as to which part of the contemporary Afroasiatic speech area corresponds with the original homeland.

==Date of Afroasiatic==
The earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] inscription dated c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Larkin | last = Mitchell | name-list-format = vanc | journal = Archaeology Magazine | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | date = March 1999 | url = http://www.archaeology.org/9903/newsbriefs/egypt.html | title = Earliest Egyptian Glyphs }}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols on [[Gerzeh culture|Gerzean]] pottery resembling [[Egyptian hieroglyphs#History and evolution|Egyptian hieroglyphs]] date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting a still earlier possible date. This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic. However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from proto-Afroasiatic (Trombetti 1905: 1–2), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them. Estimates of the date at which the proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely. They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years ago) and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago). According to [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1988: 33n), proto-Afroasiatic was spoken [[circa|c.]] 10,000 BC. According to Christopher Ehret (2002: 35–36), proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC.  These dates are older than dates associated with most other protolanguages.  Culturally this falls within the period of the [[Halfan culture]] which may have been proto-Afroasiatic.

==Urheimat hypotheses==

===Levant theory===
Supporters of a non-North or north East African origin for Afroasiatic are particularly common among those with a background in Semitic or Egyptological studies,&lt;ref name="Blench_2006"/&gt; or amongst archaeological proponents of the "farming/language dispersal hypothesis" according to which major language groups dispersed with early farming technology in the [[Neolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diamond J, Bellwood P | title = Farmers and their languages: the first expansions | journal = Science | volume = 300 | issue = 5619 | pages = 597–603 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12714734 | doi = 10.1126/science.1078208 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.1013.4523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Bellwood P, Renfrew C  | year = 2002 | title = Examining the farming/language dispersal hypothesis | publisher = McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research | location = Cambridge }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading linguistic proponent of this idea in recent times is [[Alexander Militarev]]. Arguments for and against this position depend upon the contested proposal that farming-related words can be reconstructed in Proto-Afroasiatic, with farming technology being widely thought to have spread from the [[Levant]] into [[North Africa]] and then the [[Horn of Africa]].

Militarev, who linked proto-Afroasiatic to the [[Levant]]ine [[Natufian]] culture, that preceded the spread of farming technology, believes the language family to be about 10,000 years old. He wrote (Militarev 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;135) that the "Proto-Afrasian language, on the verge of a split into daughter languages", meaning, in his scenario, into "Cushitic, Omotic, Egyptian, Semitic and Chadic-Berber", "should be roughly dated to the ninth millennium BC". But an Asiatic origin need not be associated exclusively with the migration of agricultural populations: according to linguists, words for dog (an Asian domesticate) reconstruct to Proto-Afroasiatic&lt;ref name="Blench_2006" /&gt; as well as words for bow and arrow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Diakonoff | first1 = Igor | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1998 | title = The Earliest Semitic Society: Linguistic Data | journal = Journal of Semitic Studies | volume = 43 | issue = 2| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which according to archaeologists spread rapidly across North Africa once they were introduced from the Near East i.e. Ounan points.&lt;ref name="Shirai, Noriyuki 2010"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shirai | first = Noriyuki | name-list-format = vanc | title = The Archaeology of the First Farmer-Herders in Egypt: New Insights into the Fayum Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic. | publisher = Leiden University Press | year = 2010 | isbn = 9789087280796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A scenario that also fits the linguistic evidence is one in which Afroasiatic languages were introduced into Africa together with advanced hunting techniques before the subsequent introduction of agriculture.

===Red Sea/Horn of Africa theory===
The [[Horn of Africa]], particularly the area of [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]], has been proposed by some linguists as the origin of the language group because it includes the majority of the diversity of the Afroasiatic language family and has very diverse groups in close geographic proximity, sometimes considered a telltale sign for a linguistic geographic origin. Within this hypothesis there are several variants:
*[[Christopher Ehret]] has proposed the western [[Red Sea]] coast from Eritrea to southeastern Egypt. While Ehret disputes Militarev's proposal that Proto-Afroasiatic shows signs of a common farming lexicon, he suggests that early Afroasiatic languages were involved in the even earlier development of intensive food collection in the areas of Ethiopia and Sudan. In other words, he proposes an even older age for Afroasiatic than Militarev, at least 15,000 years old and possibly older, and believes farming lexicon can only be reconstructed for branches of Afroasiatic.&lt;ref name=Ehret1982&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ehret | first = Christopher | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1982 | title = On the antiquity of agriculture in Ethiopia | journal =  Journal of African History }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehret_1995"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ehret C | year = 1995 | title = Reconstructing Proto-Afroasiatic (Proto-Afrasian): Vowels, Tone, Consonants, and Vocabulary | publisher = University of California Press | isbn = 978-0-520-09799-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehret_2002a"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ehret C | year = 2002 | title = The Civilizations of Africa: A History to 1800 | publisher = James Currey Publishers | isbn = 978-0-85255-475-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0K0p8wCNKTQC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2002b&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ehret C | chapter =  Language Family Expansions: Broadening our Understandings of Cause from an African Perspective | veditors = Bellwood P, Renfrew C  | year = 2002 | title = Examining the farming/language dispersal hypothesis | publisher = McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research | location = Cambridge }}&lt;/ref&gt; But, the appearance of linguistic terms such as dog, bow, and arrow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | medium = Television production | title = CARTA: The Origins of Us-Relationships of Ancient African Languages. | first = Christopher | last = Ehret | name-list-format = vanc | work = A Public Symposium | date = May 10, 2013 | publisher = University of California Television | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7btmAMpRLJE | time = 27:42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Proto-Afroasiatic makes a date earlier than 9,500 BC (coinciding with the end of the [[Younger Dryas]]) highly unlikely since dogs only appear at the earliest in the archaeological record after 12,000 BC in the Near East,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Clutton-Brock | first = Juliet | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1995 | chapter = Origins of the dog: domestication and early history | editor-last = Serpell | editor-first = James | title = The domestic dog: its evolution, behaviour and interactions with people | location = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-41529-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and arrowheads only appear after 9,500 BC in Africa&lt;ref name="Shirai, Noriyuki 2010"/&gt; as a result of introduction from the Near East.&lt;ref name="Shirai, Noriyuki 2010"/&gt; 
Although at [[Lake Turkana]] microlithic arrowheads appear in southern Africa (71,000 BP) and with the [[Aterian culture]] (30,000 BP) suggests that arrowheads ''may'' have been an invention originating in Africa taken into the Near East by a pre-Afroasiatic late glacial migration.  At the site of [[Nataruk]] in [[Turkana County]], Kenya, [[obsidian]] bladelets found embedded in a skull and within the thoracic cavity of another skeleton, may suggest the use of stone-tipped arrows as weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mirazón Lahr M, Rivera F, Power RK, Mounier A, Copsey B, Crivellaro F, Edung JE, Maillo Fernandez JM, Kiarie C, Lawrence J, Leakey A, Mbua E, Miller H, Muigai A, Mukhongo DM, Van Baelen A, Wood R, Schwenninger JL, Grün R, Achyuthan H, Wilshaw A, Foley RA | title = Inter-group violence among early Holocene hunter-gatherers of West Turkana, Kenya | journal = Nature | volume = 529 | issue = 7586 | pages = 394–8 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26791728 | doi = 10.1038/nature16477 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the [[last glacial period]], use of the bow seems to have spread to every inhabited continent, including the [[New World]], except for [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Monroe MH | title = Aboriginal Weapons and Tools | quote = The favoured weapon of the Aborigines was the spear and spear thrower.

But the Aborigines preferred the spear. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these finds predate by far any proposed date for the evolution of Afroasiatic.

In the next phase, unlike many other authors Ehret proposed an initial split between northern, southern and Omotic. The northern group includes [[Semitic people|Semitic]], [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] and [[Berber people|Berber]] (agreeing with others such as Diakonoff). He proposed that [[Chadic]] stems from [[Berber languages|Berber]] (some other authors group it with southern Afroasiatic languages such as Cushitic ones).
*[[Roger Blench]] has proposed Southwestern [[Ethiopia]], in or around the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo Valley]]. Compared to Militarev and Ehret he proposed a relatively young time-depth of approximately 7,500 years. Like Ehret he accepts that [[Omotic]] is Afroasiatic and sees the split of northern languages from Omotic as an important early development, but he did not group Egyptian or Chadic with any of these.

===North Africa theory===
Another proposal is that [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] is an offshoot of a northern family of Afroasiatic languages, including [[Berber languages|Berber]], and possibly [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]. It then entered the Levant and was possibly spread by what [[Juris Zarins]] calls the Syro-Arabian [[nomadic pastoralism]] complex,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zarins | first = Juris | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1990 | title = Early Pastoral Nomadism and the Settlement of Lower Mesopotamia | journal = Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research }}&lt;/ref&gt; spreading south along the shores of the Red Sea and northeast around the edge of the "[[Fertile Crescent]]". 
It is thought that Semitic speakers then crossed from South Arabia back into [[Eritrea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kitchen | first1 = Andrew | first2 = Christopher | last2 = Ehret | first3 = Shiferaw | last3 = Assefa | first4 = Connie J. | last4 = Mulligan | name-list-format = vanc | date = June 2009 | title = Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of Semitic languages identifies an Early Bronze Age origin of Semitic in the Near East | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 276 | issue = 1665 | pages = 2703–2710 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2009.0408 | pmid = 19403539 | pmc = 2839953 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Bender proposed on linguistic grounds that Cushitic (found in the Horn of Africa) shares important innovations with [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[Berber languages|Berber]], and that these three split off early from the others, while still near an original homeland of all Afroasiatic.{{clarify|date=September 2012}}

===Sahel/Sahara theory===
[[Igor Diakonoff]] proposed the Eastern [[Sahara]]  region, specifically the southern fringe of the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref name=bender1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=bernal1987&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Bernal M | year = 1987 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yFLm_M_OdK4C | title = Black Athena: the Afroasiatic roots of classical civilization | publisher = Rutgers University Press | isbn = 978-0-8135-3655-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]] proposed the area near [[Khartoum]], [[Sudan]], at the confluence of the [[Blue Nile]] and [[White Nile]].&lt;ref name=bender1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=bernal1987/&gt; The details of his theory are widely cited but controversial, as it involves the proposal that Semitic originated in Ethiopia and crossed to Asia directly from there over the Red Sea. This could also potentially solidify Bender's argument, in that scholars today believe that there is a relationship between the Cushitic branch and the Chadic Branch; arguing that perhaps Chadic descends from Cushitic.

Prior to  Colonialism the Hausa peoples of present-day Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Chad were not united as a single polity, but rather they existed as a sequence of seven city-states (situated between the [[Niger River]] and [[Lake Chad]]); each with their own Sovereign dynasty named after their shared common progenitor known as [[Bayajidda]], who apparently came from the "East" to which a great deal of scholars attribute to being the "[[Middle East]]', though this is contested. Each City-State were their own entities but were intertwined through trade, language, religion, customs, and ethnic identity/relations; hence comprising a sizable cultural stock that had greater trade links with larger states and empires such as the [[Ghana Empire]], [[Mali Empire]], [[Kanem-Bornu Empire]]s, etc.

In current day southwestern Chad and northeastern Cameroon in the [[Lake Chad Basin]], there are several ethnic groups that also speak an Afroasiatic language similar to the Hausas. They are known as respectively: the [[Biu–Mandara languages|Biu–Mandara]], [[Tumak language|Tumak]], [[Nancere language|Nancere]], [[Kera language|Kera]], [[Dangaléat language|Dangaléat]], [[Mokilko language|Mukulu]], [[Sokoro language|Sokoro]], etc. Together with the Hausa, they collectively comprise the [[Chadic]] branch of the Afro-Asiatic family. There are also remnants of a civilization on the [[Cameroon]] side of Lake Chad that date back to at least the sixth Century BCE; which is suspected of being the remains of the late [[Sao civilisation]], which scholars suspect as being the result of waves of [[Nubian people|Nubian]] migrations into West Africa (further substantiating the claims that 'Bayajidda' hence Hausas, came from the "East").{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Sub-groups such as the [[Gamergu]], [[Kanembu people|Kanembu]], [[Sokoro language|Sokoro]], and [[Musgum people|Musgum]] all claim relations to one another as well as descent from the Sao.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The most commonly cited genetic marker in recent decades has been the [[Y chromosome]], which is passed from father to son along [[patrilineage|paternal lines]] in [[Genetic recombination|un-mixed]] form, and therefore gives a relatively clear definition of one human line of descent from common ancestors. There is a high frequency of haplogroup E1b1b in select Afro-Asiatic speakers.&lt;ref name="Keita_2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lancaster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fadhlaoui-Zid_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fadhlaoui-Zid_2011" /&gt;

Several branches of humanity's Y DNA family tree have been proposed as having an association with the spread of Afroasiatic languages.

1. [[Haplogroup E1b1b]] is thought to have originated in [[Horn of Africa]]. In general, Afroasiatic speaking populations have relatively high frequencies of this haplogroup, with the notable exception of [[Chadic]] speaking populations. [[Christopher Ehret]] and Shomarka Keita have suggested that the geography of the E1b1b lineage coincides with the distribution of Afroasiatic languages.&lt;ref name="ehret2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ehret C, Keita SO, Newman P | title = The origins of Afroasiatic | journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue = 5702 | pages = 1680.3–1680 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15576591 | doi = 10.1126/science.306.5702.1680c | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/citation/306/5702/1680c | authorlink = Christopher Ehret }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. [[Haplogroup J1c3 (Y-DNA)]], formally known as "J1e", is actually a more common paternal lineage than E1b1b in most [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] speaking populations, but this is associated with [[Middle East]]ern origins and has apparently been spread from there after the original dispersion of Afroasiatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiaroni J, King RJ, Myres NM, Henn BM, Ducourneau A, Mitchell MJ, Boetsch G, Sheikha I, Lin AA, Nik-Ahd M, Ahmad J, Lattanzi F, Herrera RJ, Ibrahim ME, Brody A, Semino O, Kivisild T, Underhill PA | title = The emergence of Y-chromosome haplogroup J1e among Arabic-speaking populations | journal = European Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 348–53 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19826455 | pmc = 2987219 | doi = 10.1038/ejhg.2009.166 | url = http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v18/n3/abs/ejhg2009166a.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

3. [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)#R1b1a|Haplogroup R1b1a]] (R-V88), and specifically its sub-clade R-V69, has a very strong relationship with Chadic speaking populations, who unlike other Afroasiatic speakers have low frequencies of Haplogroup E1b1b.&lt;ref name="Cruciani2010"/&gt; The majority of R-V88 was found in northern and central Africa, in Chadic speaking populations. It is less common in neighbouring populations. The authors also found evidence of high concentration in Western [[Egypt]] and evidence that the closest related types of [[R1b]] are found in the [[Middle East]] in the [[Levant]], and to a lesser extent southern [[Europe]]. They proposed that an Eastern [[Saharan languages|Saharan]] origin for Chadic R1b would agree with linguistic theories such as those of Christopher Ehret, that Chadic and [[Berber people|Berber]] form a related group within Afroasiatic, which originated in the area of the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref name=Cruciani2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cruciani F, Trombetta B, Sellitto D, Massaia A, Destro-Bisol G, Watson E, Beraud Colomb E, Dugoujon JM, Moral P, Scozzari R | title = Human Y chromosome haplogroup R-V88: a paternal genetic record of early mid Holocene trans-Saharan connections and the spread of Chadic languages | journal = European Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 800–7 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20051990 | pmc = 2987365 | doi = 10.1038/ejhg.2009.231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; R1b-V88 had probably entered Africa from [[Western Asia]], via [[Egypt]], and moved south along the [[Nile river]] and eventually crossing over to [[West Africa]] between 9,200 and 5,600 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Santos FR, Bianchi NO, Pena SD (1996) Worldwide distribution of human Y-chromosome haplotypes.

A. (2010a). Haplogroup R1b1 and its subclades in Asia. Proceedings of the Russian Academy of DNA Genealogy, 3, 1676 - 1695 (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the evidence from paternally inherited Y DNA, a recent study has shown that a branch of mitochondrial [[haplogroup L3]] links the maternal ancestry of Chadic speakers from the Sahel with Cushitic speakers from Horn of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cerný V, Fernandes V, Costa MD, Hájek M, Mulligan CJ, Pereira L | title = Migration of Chadic speaking pastoralists within Africa based on population structure of Chad Basin and phylogeography of mitochondrial L3f haplogroup | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 9 | pages = 63 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19309521 | pmc = 2680838 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-9-63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other mitochondrial lineages that are associated with Afroasiatic include mitochondrial haplogroups [[haplogroup M1|M1]] and [[haplogroup U6]]. Gonzalez et al. 2007 suggest that Afroasiatic speakers may have dispersed from Horn of Africa carrying the subclades M1a and U6a1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = González AM, Larruga JM, Abu-Amero KK, Shi Y, Pestano J, Cabrera VM | title = Mitochondrial lineage M1 traces an early human backflow to Africa | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 8 | pages = 223 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17620140 | pmc = 1945034 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-8-223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an autosomal DNA study by Hodgson et al. (2014), the Afroasiatic languages were likely spread across Africa and the Near East by an ancestral population(s) carrying a newly identified non-African genetic component, which the researchers dub the "Ethio-Somali". This Ethio-Somali component is today most common among Afroasiatic-speaking populations in the Horn of Africa. It is most closely related to the Maghrebi non-African genetic component, and is believed to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries at least 23,000 years ago. On this basis, the researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population(s) probably arrived in the pre-agricultural period from the Near East, having crossed over into northeastern Africa via the Sinai peninsula. The population then likely split into two branches, with one group heading westward toward the Maghreb and the other moving south into the Horn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodgson JA, Mulligan CJ, Al-Meeri A, Raaum RL | title = Early back-to-Africa migration into the Horn of Africa | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = e1004393 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24921250 | pmc = 4055572 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A related hypothesis that associates the origin of the ancestors of Afroasiatic speakers as the result of a reflux population from Southwest Asia during the Late Palaeolithic was previously put forward by Daniel McCall.

==Nostratic hypothesis==
The [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic language family]] is a proposed [[macrofamily]] grouping together a number of language families including [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]], [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic]], and more controversially Afroasiatic. Following Pedersen, Illich-Svitych, and Dolgopolsky, most advocates of the theory have included [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] in Nostratic, though criticisms by [[Joseph Greenberg]] and others from the late 1980s onward suggested a reassessment of this position.

[[Ilya Yabonovich]] and other linguists, in examining the differences between the various members of the [[Afroasiatic]] family have realised that all of the old etymologies for this group were inherently semitocentric. The differences between [[Chadic]], [[Omotic]], [[Cushitic]] and [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], were wider than those seen between any members of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family and as wide as some of the differences seen within and between separate language families, for example, [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and [[Altaic languages|Altaic]].  Certainly the exclusion of Afroasiatic from the controversial Nostratic family has simplified matters of phonemics, not having to include the complex patterns seen in Afroasiatic languages.

[[Allan Bomhard]] (1994) retains Afroasiatic within Nostratic, despite his admission that Proto–Afroasiatic is very different from the other members of the proposed linguistic Nostratic superfamily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bomhard | first1 = Alan | first2 = John | last2 = Kerns | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1994 | title = The Nostratic Macrofamily: A Study in Distant Linguistic Relationship | publisher = Walter de Gruyter }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he suggests it was probably the first language to have split from the Nostratic linguistic superfamily.
Recently, however, a consensus has been emerging among proponents of the Nostratic hypothesis. Greenberg in fact basically agreed with the Nostratic concept, though he stressed a deep internal division between its northern 'tier' (his [[Eurasiatic]]) and a southern 'tier' (principally Afroasiatic and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]]). The American Nostraticist Bomhard considers Eurasiatic a branch of Nostratic alongside other branches: Afroasiatic, [[Elamo-Dravidian]], and Kartvelian. Similarly, [[Georgiy Starostin]] (2002) arrives at a tripartite overall grouping: he considers Afroasiatic, Nostratic and Elamite to be roughly equidistant and more closely related to each other than to anything else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://starling.rinet.ru/Texts/elam.pdf | first = George | last = Starostin | name-list-format = vanc | title = On the genetic affiliation of the Elamite language | journal = Mother Tongue | issn = 1087-0326 | volume = 7 | year = 2002 | pages = 147–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergei Starostin's school has now re-included Afroasiatic in a broadly defined Nostratic, while reserving the term Eurasiatic to designate the narrower subgrouping which comprises the rest of the macrofamily. Recent proposals thus differ mainly on the precise placement of Dravidian and Kartvelian.

'''Alice Louise Waters''' (born April 28, 1944) is an American chef, restaurateur, activist and author. She is the owner of [[Chez Panisse]], a [[Berkeley, California]] restaurant famous for its [[Organic farming|organic]], [[local food|locally grown]] ingredients and for pioneering [[California cuisine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Straus |first = Karen Cope |title = Alice Waters: Earth Mother of California Cuisine |work = [[Vegetarian Times]] |date = June 1997 |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0820/is_n238/ai_19684398/?tag=content;col1 |accessdate = July 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which she opened in 1971.

In addition to her restaurant, Waters has written several books on food and cooking, including ''Chez Panisse Cooking'' (with [[Paul Bertolli]]), ''The Art of Simple Food I and II,'' and ''40 Years of Chez Panisse.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = CBS News |title = Alice Waters' Crusade for Better Food |work = 60 Minutes |date = June 4, 2009 |url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/03/13/60minutes/main4863738.shtml |accessdate = July 29, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100728232700/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/03/13/60minutes/main4863738.shtml |archivedate = July 28, 2010  |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her memoir, ''Coming to my Senses: The Making of a Counterculture Cook'' was published in September 2017 and released in paperback in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nozari |first1=Elaheh |title=8 Non-Cookbooks to Read This Summer |url=https://www.bonappetit.com/story/8-non-cookbook-food-books-to-read-this-summer |accessdate=June 13, 2018 |publisher=bon appétit |date=June 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She founded the [[Chez Panisse Foundation]] in 1996, and created the [[Edible Schoolyard]] program at the [[Martin Luther King Middle School (Berkeley)|Martin Luther King Middle School]] in Berkeley, California. Waters serves as a public policy advocate on the national level for school lunch reform and universal access to healthy, organic foods, and the impact of her work in organic food and nutrition is typified by [[Michelle Obama]]'s White House organic vegetable garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Dowd |first = Maureen |title = Chef Waters' Vision Becomes Hot Topic |work = [[The New York Times]] via SunSentinel.com |date = April 28, 2009 |url = http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2009-04-28/news/0904270446_1_organic-food-alice-waters-white-house |accessdate = July 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Waters was born in [[Chatham Borough, New Jersey]] on April 28, 1944 to Charles Allen Waters, a [[Rutgers University]] graduate who was a management consultant, and Margaret Waters who was a stay at home mom. Alice graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] after transferring there from [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UC Santa Barbara]]. She received a degree in French Cultural Studies in 1967. During her time at UC Berkeley, she studied abroad in France, where she shopped for local produce and prepared fresh foods simply in order to enhance the experience of the table. During her time in France, she says she "lived at the bottom of a market street" and "took everything in by osmosis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Times Topics: People: Alice Waters |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = August 14, 1996 |url = http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/w/alice_waters/index.html |accessdate = August 5, 2010 |first = Andrew |last = Martin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She brought this style of food preparation back to Berkeley, where she popularized the concept of market-fresh cooking with the local products available to her in Northern California.&lt;ref name="Burros1996"&gt;{{cite news |last = Burros |first = Marian |title = Alice Waters: Food Revolutionary |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = August 14, 1996 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/14/garden/alice-waters-food-revolutionary.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate = July 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For her, food is a way of life and not just something to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Chef Alice's Way of Life |url = http://www.pioneerchef.com/2014/07/11/chef-alices-way-of-life/ |website = pioneerchef.com |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714005348/http://www.pioneerchef.com/2014/07/11/chef-alices-way-of-life/ |archivedate = July 14, 2014 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free Speech Movement ==
During her time at UC Berkeley, Waters became active in the [[Free Speech Movement]], which was sweeping across the campus.&lt;ref name="Burros"&gt;{{cite news |last = Burros |first = Marian |title = Alice Waters: Food Revolutionary |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = August 14, 1996 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/14/garden/alice-waters-food-revolutionary.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate = July 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orenstein"&gt;{{cite news |last = Orenstein |first = Peggy |title = Food Fighter: Food Revolutionary |work=The New York Times Magazine |date = March 7, 2004 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/07/magazine/food-fighter.html?ref=alice_waters |accessdate = August 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waters worked on the congressional campaign of [[Robert Scheer]], an anti-Vietnam War politician. She often cooked for and entertained her fellow campaigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Crawford |first = Leslie |title = Alice Waters |work = Salon.com |date = November 16, 1999 |url = http://www.salon.com/people/bc/1999/11/16/waters/index.html?CP=SAL&amp;DN=110 |accessdate = August 4, 2010 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20020606024349/http://www.salon.com/people/bc/1999/11/16/waters/index.html?CP=SAL&amp;DN=110 |archivedate = June 6, 2002 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additional influences ==
Waters eventually returned to Europe, where she first trained at a [[Montessori method|Montessori]] school in London, and then spent time traveling in Turkey and then in France once again. Principles of the Montessori method, which emphasize practical and hands-on activities for children, are evident in Waters' idea of "edible education" and her Edible Schoolyard, which engages children in the preparation of fruits and vegetables that they tend to with the supervision of their teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Waters |first = Alice |last2 = Liittschwager |first2 = David |last3 = Duane |first3 = Daniel |title = Edible Education: a Universal Idea |publisher = Chronicle Books |year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orenstein"/&gt;

After training in London, Waters next traveled to Turkey, which she credits with influencing her approach to hospitality and deepening her respect for local communities. In his book ''Alice Waters and Chez Panisse'', Thomas McNamee recounts Waters' experience in Turkey, where a young Turkish boy shared tea and a small bit of cheese with Waters and her traveling companions, even though he had very little. This small act of kindness had an effect on Waters's approach to hospitality and generosity in her own restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = McNamee |first = Thomas |title = Alice Waters and Chez Panisse |publisher = Penguin Books |page = 36 |year = 2007 |isbn = 1-59420-115-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Turkey, Waters then returned to France, where she embarked upon a year-long journey. Her travels solidified her love of all things food and French and inspired her to return to California and open Chez Panisse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Tirella |first = Joseph V. |title = CNNmoney.com |date = August 28, 2009 |url = http://money.cnn.com/2009/08/27/smallbusiness/alice_waters_how_we_got_started.fsb/index.htm0 |accessdate = August 4, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waters counts [[Elizabeth David]], the English cookbook author and writer, as one of her influences. She also credits [[Richard Olney (food writer)|Richard Olney]], an American authority on French food who spent much of his life living in France, with influencing her simple, rustic cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Whiting |first = John |title = The Evolution of Chez Panisse |year = 2002 |url = http://www.whitings-writings.com/essays/chez_panisse.htm |accessdate = July 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olney introduced Waters to Lucien and Lulu Peyraud, owners of the Domaine Tempier vineyard in Provence. Lulu Peyraud's vineyard cooking significantly influenced Waters' cooking and her menus at Chez Panisse. In her foreword to Olney's book, ''Lulu's Provençal Table'', Waters wrote: "Lucien and Lulu's warmhearted enthusiasm for life, their love for the pleasures of the table, their deep connection to the beautiful earth of the South of France – these were things I had seen at the movies. But this was for real. I felt immediately as if I had come home to second family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Olney |first = Richard |title = Lulu's Provencal Table: The exuberant food and wine from the Domaine Tempier vineyard |publisher = HarperCollins |year = 1994 |page = xi |isbn = 0-06-016922-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Waters has said that she learned Chinese cooking from [[Cecilia Chiang]], and the two became lifelong friends.&lt;ref name=journey&gt;{{cite news |title = Cecilia Chiang's epic journey |author = Janet Fletcher |date = October 27, 2007 |publisher = San Francisco Chronicle |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/24/FD9GSOJA9.DTL }}&lt;/ref&gt; Waters has said that what Chiang did to popularize Chinese cuisine in America is what [[Julia Child]] did for French Cuisine.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.asianpacificfund.org/awards/bio_chiang.shtml |publisher = the Asian Pacific Fund |title = Cecilia Sun Yun Chiang |year = 2004 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100104081100/http://www.asianpacificfund.org/awards/bio_chiang.shtml |archivedate = January 4, 2010 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher = SF Weekly |title = Local Heavies to Celebrate Cecilia Chiang, the Julia Child of Chinese Cooking |author = Meredith Brody |date = September 16, 2009 |url = http://blogs.sfweekly.com/foodie/2009/09/food_world_heavies_to_celebrat.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chez Panisse ==

=== Background ===
In 1971, Waters opened [[Chez Panisse]], which she named for a favorite character in a trilogy of [[Marcel Pagnol]] films. From the beginning, the restaurant was a collaborative effort; one notable collaboration was with [[Jeremiah Tower]], who created the recipes that she later published under her name. Tower took the organic ingredients and melded them into a more refined menu. Chez Panisse was intended to serve primarily as a place where Waters could entertain her friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Burros |first = Marian |title = Alice Waters: Food Revolutionary |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = August 14, 1996 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/14/garden/alice-waters-food-revolutionary.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate = July 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing the difficulty in sourcing fresh, high-quality ingredients, Waters began building a network of local farmers, artisans, and producers, and continues to source the restaurant's ingredients through her local network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Chez Panisse |first =  |title = About Chez Panisse |url = http://www.chezpanisse.com/about/chez-panisse |accessdate = July 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Waters opened the upstairs Chez Panisse Café, a concept championed by Tower, in 1980. Café serves an a la carte menu for lunch and dinner. In 1984, Waters opened Café Fanny, named after her daughter, a few blocks from the restaurant.  Café Fanny, which served breakfast and lunch in a casual, European-café setting, closed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2012/03/08/cafe-fanny-closing-tomorrow-after-28-years-its-just-not-economically-viable-anymore/ |work = The San Francisco Chronicle |title = Cafe Fanny closing tomorrow after 28 years: 'It's just not economically viable anymore.' }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Waters mainly focused on the importance of organic farmers. Through Chez Panisse foundation, the project called "Edible Schoolyard" was organized in order to make an environment for the students to grow their own products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9848900 |title = The Food Revolution of Alice Waters' Chez Panisse |author =  |date =  |website = npr.org |accessdate = June 4, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dedication to organic food ===
Central to the operations and philosophy of Chez Panisse is Waters' and the restaurant's dedication to using organic ingredients. Waters has become a crusader for organic foods, believing that they are both better for the environment and for people's health in addition to tasting superior to commercially grown, non-organic foods.

Waters became an organic devotee almost by accident, claiming that what she was originally after was taste. She says: "When I opened up Chez Panisse, I was only thinking about taste. And in doing that, I ended up at the doorstep of [organic farmers]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Leavenworth |first = Stuart |title = The Chef Apprentice: After 37 Years, Alice Waters Still Searches for a Slow Food Life |work = Sacramento Bee |date = May 28, 2009 |url = http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/the_chef_apprentice/2009/05/after-37-years-alice-waters-st.html/022626.html |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111008005733/http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/the_chef_apprentice/2009/05/after-37-years-alice-waters-st.html/022626.html |archivedate = October 8, 2011 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waters' current organic food agenda includes reforming the USDA school lunch program to include organic, local fruits and vegetables and changing the way America eats, but her passion for organics started at her restaurant, where she discovered that organic ingredients were the essential element necessary to create delicious food. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

== Activism and public policy influence ==
Waters' effort to promote fresh, sustainable food grown by local farms has extended into her work as a food activist and humanitarian. Waters has always been an outspoken supporter of the restaurant's approach to food, cooking, and supporting the local community, but has more recently formalized her efforts through the Chez Panisse Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Burros |first = Marian |title = Alice Waters: Food Revolutionary |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = August 14, 1996|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/14/garden/alice-waters-food-revolutionary.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate = July 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In celebration of the restaurant's 25th anniversary, Waters founded the Chez Panisse Foundation in 1996, whose mission is to transform public education by using food to teach, nurture, and empower young people.&lt;ref name="Mission"&gt;{{cite web |last = Chez Panisse |first =  |title = Foundation and Mission |url = http://www.chezpanisse.com/about/foundation-and-mission |accessdate = July 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the Foundation has worked with the [[Berkeley Unified School District]] to develop a public school curriculum that is integrated with the school dining services and incorporates growing, cooking, and sharing food at the table into the school day in order to build a humane and sustainable future for the school's students.&lt;ref name="Mission" /&gt;

The Chez Panisse Foundation is a publicly supported [[501(c)(3)]] organization.

== Edible Schoolyard and Edible Education ==
The primary work of the Chez Panisse Foundation has been to establish and sustain the Edible Schoolyard program at Berkeley's Martin Luther King, Jr. Middle School. The Edible Schoolyard was established in 1995 and is a {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} organic garden and kitchen classroom. Students at the middle school are involved in growing, harvesting, and preparing the foods from the garden, with the aim of promoting the environmental and social well-being of the school community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Chez Panisse Foundation |first =  |title = Edible Schoolyard |url = http://www.chezpanissefoundation.org/edible-schoolyard |accessdate = July 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waters' work at the Edible Schoolyard has also developed into her School Lunch Initiative, which has the broader goal of bringing school children into a new relationship with food by making a healthy, fresh, sustainable meal a part of the school day. The School Lunch Initiative is a collaborative project with the [[Center for Ecoliteracy]], also in Berkeley, and is also the topic of a series of studies through the Center for Weight and Health, at UC Berkeley.&lt;ref name="Chez"&gt;{{cite web |last = Chez Panisse Foundation |first =  |title = School Lunch Reform |url = http://www.chezpanissefoundation.org/school-lunch-reform |accessdate = July 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School Lunch Initiative is focused on bringing wholesome school lunch to the 10,000 students in the Berkeley Unified School District. In 2005, the Chez Panisse Foundation provided a grant to Berkeley schools to hire Ann Cooper as the Director of Nutrition Services for the district. Cooper and the Foundation eliminated almost all processed foods from the district and introduced organic fruits and vegetables to the daily menu, all while staying within the district's budget.&lt;ref name="Chez" /&gt; Waters' vision is to teach subjects such as history, science, and art through the vehicle of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Dowd |first = Maureen |title = Chef Waters' Vision Becomes Hot Topic |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = April 28, 2009 |url = http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2009-04-28/news/0904270446_1_organic-food-alice-waters-white-house |accessdate = July 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, the Center for Weight and Health at UC Berkeley, Center for Ecoliteracy, and Chez Panisse Foundation released an evaluation report on the School Lunch Initiative. The report tracked elementary and middle school students over three years to determine the effects of the School Lunch Initiative on children's eating habits and knowledge. The report found that students in schools with highly developed School Lunch Initiative components ate more daily servings of fruit and vegetables than students in schools with lesser developed programs, and that they scored higher on food knowledge assessments. Schools with highly developed School Lunch Initiative components integrated kitchen and garden classes into the school curriculum, in addition to overhauling the school lunch program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Finz |first = Stacy |title = School meals study provides food for thought |work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date = September 23, 2010 |url = http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-09-23/news/24085223_1_food-programs-junk-food-nutrition |accessdate = September 28, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100927210204/http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-09-23/news/24085223_1_food-programs-junk-food-nutrition |archivedate = September 27, 2010  |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the work of the Chez Panisse Foundation has focused primarily on the Berkeley Unified School District, Waters has become a vocal and familiar advocate for school lunch reform and activism at the national level, as well. She encouraged [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] to plant a White House garden.&lt;ref name="Burros"/&gt; In 2009, she appeared on the CBS television program "[[60 Minutes]]," and made a public call for [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] to plant an organic garden at the White House to catalyze change in the US food system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = CBS News |first =  |title = Alice Waters' Crusade for Better Food |work = 60 Minutes |date = June 4, 2009 |url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/03/13/60minutes/main4863738.shtml |accessdate = July 29, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100728232700/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/03/13/60minutes/main4863738.shtml |archivedate = July 28, 2010  |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michelle Obama, in conjunction with her anti-obesity campaign [[Let's Move!]], planted the White House organic vegetable garden that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Burros |first = Marian |title = Obamas to Plant Vegetable Garden at White House |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = March 19, 2009 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/dining/20garden.html |accessdate = July 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' states that:

=== Edible Schoolyard affiliate programs ===
In addition to the Edible Schoolyard in Berkeley, there are five affiliate Edible Schoolyard programs around the country. These include Edible Schoolyards in New Orleans, New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. The Edible Schoolyard in New Orleans serves students in grades K through 8 from the Green Charter and Arthur Ashe Charter Schools. In addition to Open Garden, which includes the entire community in preparing a seasonal meal, the Edible Schoolyard has become a part of the school curriculum, and helps students learn about Creole cooking and indigenous food traditions. The affiliate program in New York City, located in Brooklyn at P.S. 216, will boast a newly designed kitchen and a four-season greenhouse in addition to a quarter-acre organic farm. P.S. 216 has nearly 500 students in grades K though 5, with 16% English language learners. The Greensboro affiliate program opened in 2009 at the Greensboro Children's Museum, and hosts a variety of weekend, after-school, and summer programs for children in the community. The program will also provide training and education for community parents and early childhood professionals.

The Larchmont Charter Schools in [[Los Angeles]] incorporate several gardens into their four campuses, which infuse the school curriculum with real-life applications through gardening and science. Participation in the school lunch program at the Larchmont Charter Schools is mandatory, and often features a family-style lunch made from local and organic ingredients. The San Francisco Edible Schoolyard program is operated through the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Club]] in Hunters Point, where there is a distinct need for access to healthy food and nutrition education. In addition to hosting an {{convert|800|sqft|m2|adj=on}} garden, the program hosts cooking classes and organizes trips to local farmers markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Chez Panisse Foundation |first =  |title = Mission and Vision |url = http://www.chezpanissefoundation.org/affiliate-network |accessdate = July 29, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100722163446/http://www.chezpanissefoundation.org/affiliate-network |archivedate = July 22, 2010  |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other advocacy projects ===
Currently, Waters is working at the national policy level to extend free school meals to all public school children in the United States. She hopes to expand programs like the Edible Schoolyard and the School Lunch Initiative in order to reach schools across the US. She supports the [[William F. Goodling Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act of 1998|Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act]], and believes that providing all public school students with free food in school would build the foundation for a healthier and more sustainable food culture in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Gordon |first = Wendy |title = Alice Waters: Chef, Healthy School Lunch Crusader |work = SimpleSteps.org |date = April 7, 2010 |url = http://www.simplesteps.org/food/eating-well/alice-water-chef-healthy-school-lunch-crusader |accessdate = August 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Waters helped create the [[Yale Sustainable Food Project]], which aims to make sustainable food an important part of university-level education. The project maintains an on-campus organic farm and integrates organic, local products into the university's dining program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = About Us |url = http://www.yale.edu/sustainablefood/aboutus.html |accessdate = August 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Slow Food ==
Since 2002, Waters has served as a Vice President of [[Slow Food]] International, an organization dedicated to preserving local food traditions, protecting biodiversity, promoting small-scale quality products around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Our Mission |url = http://www.slowfood.com/about_us/eng/mission.lasso |accessdate = August 5, 2010 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081021063749/http://www.slowfood.com/about_us/eng/mission.lasso |archivedate = October 21, 2008 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was drawn to the Slow Food movement because of its work in passing food knowledge and traditions to future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Lander |first = Nicholas |title = Why Women Excel in the Kitchen |work = The Financial Times |date = August 14, 1996 |url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/4299ec7c-32de-11df-bf5f-00144feabdc0.html |accessdate = August 5, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100831091314/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/4299ec7c-32de-11df-bf5f-00144feabdc0.html |archivedate = August 31, 2010  |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amelia Peabody Emerson''' is the [[protagonist]] of the [[Amelia Peabody series]], a series of [[historical mystery]] novels written by author [[Elizabeth Peters]] (a pseudonym of Egyptologist Barbara Mertz, 1927–2013). Peabody is married to [[Egyptologist]] [[Radcliffe Emerson]] and has one biological child, [[Ramses Emerson|Walter "Ramses" Peabody Emerson]].

== Biographical sketch ==
Amelia Peabody is first introduced in the novel ''[[Crocodile on the Sandbank]]'', set in 1884. She is the spinster daughter of a reclusive scholar who left her to deal with practical issues such as shopping and administering the household while he spent time in his office. He nurtured her scholarly interest, while the rest of her immediate family dismissed them both. Following his death, Peabody's devotion to her father was rewarded with her being named sole beneficiary of his substantial fortune of over £500,000 (over £30 million in 2006 values). Partly in order to escape the attention of numerous fortune-hunting suitors and relatives begging for money, she embarks on a tour of classical sites, beginning in [[Italy]] and moving on to [[Egypt]] with the eventual aim of visiting [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. While in [[Rome]], she rescues a young woman in trouble, [[Evelyn Emerson|Evelyn Barton Forbes]], whom she hires to be her companion.

In Egypt, the pair encounters the Emerson brothers, Radcliffe, an [[archaeologist]], and Walter, a [[philologist]]. Over the course of the novel, Walter pursues Evelyn resulting in their engagement by the book's end—while less overt, the relationship between Amelia and Radcliffe develops toward their own marriage. In keeping with the egalitarian nature of their relationship, the two propose to each other, with Amelia teasing that she agreed because marriage to Emerson was the only way that she could engage in [[Egyptology]] without causing a scandal.

The pair refer to each other by their respective surnames: Emerson refers to Amelia as "Peabody," using her first name only when he is annoyed with her. In turn, Peabody refers to Radcliffe Emerson almost exclusively by his surname, "Emerson", although some other family members call him Radcliffe. It is eventually revealed that he dislikes his first name as it was his estranged mother's maiden name.

Peabody's first (and only) child, Walter, was born in 1887. Walter quickly became known as "Ramses", after Emerson remarked that he was "swarthy as an Egyptian and arrogant as a pharaoh."{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The majority of the series is written in Amelia's [[Point of view (literature)|voice]], with Ramses providing a supplemental parallel narrative in many of the later books, identified as "Manuscript H."

== Personality ==
Amelia Peabody is presented as a head-strong, confident woman who capably ran her father's household and bullied local merchants in the course of bargaining. It is quickly established that she has no patience with "helpless" women who play on their femininity to manipulate others into doing their will; i.e., "swooning, weak-minded females", according to Emerson. When home in England, she is a strong supporter of and is occasionally involved in the [[Suffragette]] Movement.  She is a proponent of [[Victorian dress reform|rational dress]], and often refuses to wear a [[corset]]. (See ''[[Deeds of the Disturber]]'' for a notable exception.)

With the introduction of the Manuscript H fragments in ''[[Seeing a Large Cat]]'' the reader is introduced to her family's loving perceptions of her, which includes recognition of her extraordinary stubbornness, and utter conviction that she is right, even when she contradicts herself in the assertion.  This is dealt with in good humor and affection by her family.  Amelia is also addicted to romance (although she denies it vehemently), much more sentimental than she admits to and, despite her disdain for weak-willed women who employ impractical fashion, vain enough to go to great lengths to color her graying hair and hide her efforts particularly from Emerson.

At the core of her personality is her deep love for her husband (and his for her), as well as the mutual respect they share for one another.. A favourite expression of hers is "Another shirt ruined..." because Emerson regularly bursts out of his shirt, either in the course of an adventure or in the throes of passion. The relationship between Amelia and Emerson may best be described as 'Brontean'; the story of the handsome but rough-mannered hero tamed by the right woman plays out according to classic Romantic formula. She extends this view to her family and acquaintances, often imagining relationships that are not there, while totally missing those that are, until she is shocked by the revelation of who has proposed to whom.

Amelia's dress and mannerisms are frequently the cause of comment and wonder from outsiders.  In earlier books in the series it is established that her favorite ruins to explore are pyramids.  She usually carries one of her collection of parasols, which she uses as discreet, or not so discreet, weapons (including a sword-parasol). Her other usual accessory is her belt, later partially replaced with a vest with many pockets. It contains: "Pistol and knife, canteen, bottle of brandy, candle and matches in a waterproof box, notebook and pencil, needle and thread, compass, scissors, first-aid kit and a coil of stout cord (useful for tying up captured enemies)." (''[[He Shall Thunder in the Sky]]'', Chapter 2)

Though she carries a small pistol, she is a terrible shot and rarely makes an effort to improve her skill, laughing off Emerson's suggestions that she could do more harm than good.  Unfortunately, on more than one occasion she has come close to harming a member of the family while wielding the pistol, rarely blaming herself for the near miss (e.g. her shooting at Ramses and an assailant in ''[[The Ape Who Guards the Balance]]'').  Because her family is frequently involved in stopping criminal activity, and she has successfully deduced facts of numerous cases, she views herself as an expert in such matters, to the point of denigrating truly competent law enforcement officers.  And because some of the plots they have uncovered were in fact complex, she tends to make all solutions, even those not involving crime, complex and even outlandish while missing the obvious.  Joined with her stubbornness, this tendency to over-analyze a problem frequently leads to her holding an incorrect belief far longer than is safe for her or her family.

Another feature of the novels is the egalitarian theme, with Amelia and her family being very close to the family of their original Egyptian ''reis'' (foreman) Abdullah, to the extent that there is a marriage between Amelia's English niece and Abdullah's [[Coptic Christian]] grandson.  Following the covenant of the time, this pairing is initially met with resistance from all—including Amelia, much to her own surprise—because of David's origins and nationality.  It is when she has a change of heart and is able to convince others that the young couple's affection should take precedence over notions of race that the pairing is allowed to proceed. Following Abdullah's death, Amelia begins to see him in dreams, where he gives her warnings and advice, further illustrating how close they were.

Amelia is a proponent of equality between the sexes, and brings up her adopted daughter, [[Nefret Emerson]], accordingly.  This does not prevent her from routinely criticizing Nefret or other young women for acting as rashly as she herself regularly does.  Her name among the Egyptians is "Sitt Hakim", or Lady Doctor.  This was given her when, soon after her initial arrival in Egypt, she showed such care for the Egyptians she encountered, particularly in treating a number of eye diseases—such as [[ophthalmia]]—that were common at the time.  Her love for Egypt and its people is as deep and often reveals itself in her distaste for Europeans that view Egyptians with either condescension or disgust.

Perhaps her greatest personal conflict is her long term love-hate relationship with [[Sethos (Peabody mysteries)|Sethos]].  From the first encounter with him as the “Master Criminal”, she has seen him behind many of the plots they encounter; even when it is clear to everyone else that he is not involved.  Yet she is strangely drawn to him and feels that there is something about him that fills her with emotions that are otherwise restricted to Emerson.  She becomes convinced that she alone has brought about his reformation, even though it is a number of years after that “reformation” that Sethos is actually rehabilitated.

While certainly being far more open minded than many Victorians, she is still a product of her age.  Her conviction of British superiority in most everything is third, only behind her own self-confidence and her belief that Emerson is the “greatest Egyptologist of this or any age.”

== Amelia's age ==
Amelia's age is initially given as 32 in ''[[Crocodile on the Sandbank]]'', set in 1884.  In a 1994 article, Elizabeth Peters discussed the obstacle this presented:

''"If I had intended ''Crocodile'' to be the first in a series, I probably wouldn't have been as specific about dates. Not only did Amelia inform the reader of her age (curse her!), but historical events mentioned in the book tied it to a particular year. As the series continued, there was no way I could get around this, or fudge the date of Ramses' birth, or keep him and his parents from aging a year every twelve months."''&lt;ref&gt;"Series Characters: Love 'em or Leave 'em," by Elizabeth Peters, ''The Writer'' (v. 107, No. 4, p.&amp;nbsp;9 - April 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this timeline, Amelia would be seventy years old in the eighteenth book, ''[[Tomb of the Golden Bird]]'', set in 1922-23.  In ''[[The Hippopotamus Pool]]'', however, the Introduction contains what is supposed to be an excerpt from "''The National Autobiographical Dictionary'' (45th edition)", in which Amelia herself states that she was her late twenties at the time of her first visit to Egypt.  The statement is footnoted, and the footnote provides specific instructions not to question the discrepancy (pp. xii and xvi.).

In ''[[Seeing a Large Cat]]'', Emerson's age at the time they married is given as 29, making him three years younger than his wife.

The latest chronological mention of Amelia is in the compendium ''[[Amelia Peabody's Egypt: A Compendium]]'', which mentions her taking a souvenir from her visit to Egypt in 1939, as war is looming and she was uncertain that she would ever return.   Her age is given as 87, which would be correct according to the original timeline.

== Pronunciation ==
In an interview with Diane Rehm, Peters discussed the correct pronunciation of "Peabody," which she had intended to be pronounced "PEA-b&lt;sup&gt;uh&lt;/sup&gt;-d&lt;sup&gt;ee&lt;/sup&gt;" (piːbʌdi) in the style of upper class [[England|English]] and [[New England]] society, not "pea-BOD-i" (piːbaːdiː).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wamu.org/programs/dr/01/05/29.php |title=Tuesday, May 29, 2001 &amp;#124; The Diane Rehm Show from WAMU and NPR |publisher=Wamu.org |date=2001-05-29 |accessdate=2012-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091224162628/http://wamu.org/programs/dr/01/05/29.php |archive-date=2009-12-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in the audio versions of the books—including those recorded by voice actress [[Barbara Rosenblat]], whom Peters has praised for her accurate pronunciation—Amelia's surname is pronounced "pea-BOD-i."

The difference in nationality between the Emersons and their creator is sometimes revealed through the use of American terms like "railroad", spelling differences, etc.

A '''baby jumper''' is a device that can be used by [[infant]]s to exercise and play in. The original baby jumper consists of a hoop suspended by an elastic strap. More elaborate baby jumbers have a base made of hard plastic sitting in a frame and a suspended fabric seat with two leg holes, often with trays holding [[toy]]s. The door jumpers lack the tray. There are also mobile play centers ([[baby walkers]]), which look very similar to baby jumpers, but which have wheels.

==History==
The Jolly Jumper brand refers to a Native American origin, where mothers used [[cradleboard]]s to keep their [[infant]]s in when travelling or working. When working outside, the mother could attach the cradleboard to a tree limb using its straps. By pulling the limb, thus causing a bouncing motion, the baby would be soothed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jolly Jumper history |url=http://www.jollyjumper.com/history |access-date=2017-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219143021/http://www.jollyjumper.com/history |archive-date=2016-12-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jolly Jumper claims to have invented the baby jumper in 1910, using an axe handle for the spreader;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The original Jolly Jumper |url=http://www.thedue.date/jolly-jumpers/}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the baby jumper existed long before that.

==Risks==
Some professionals warn against potential safety issues when using a jumper for prolonged periods of time, claiming that it could cause muscle imbalance if the child is placed in a sitting position before they would be able to on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The pitfalls of some modern day baby equipment

The '''Berman Jewish DataBank''', founded as the '''North American Jewish Data Bank''', is the central online source for social scientific studies of North American Jewry and world Jewish populations and communities. The DataBank’s primary functions are to acquire and archive materials from quantitative studies of North American Jews, including data sets and reports, and to encourage and aid the production and utilization of quantitative research on North American Jews.

The DataBank maintains partnerships with the [[Berman Jewish Policy Archive]] and the [[University of Connecticut]]’s Center for Judaic Studies and Contemporary Jewish Life.

The DataBank holds more than 375 surveys and studies of North American Jews, including more than 200 local community studies usually commissioned by local [[The Jewish Federations of North America|Jewish federations]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishdatabank.org/About/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the DataBank comes from an endowment provided by the [[Mandell and Madeleine Berman Foundation]] and from [[The Jewish Federations of North America]] (JFNA), and management is provided by JFNA. The DataBank’s professional staff includes Laurence Kotler-Berkowtiz, Director of the Berman Jewish DataBank; [[Ron Miller (sociologist)|Ron Miller]], Senior Research Consultant at the  Berman Jewish DataBank; and [[Arnold Dashefsky]], Director Emeritus and Senior Academic Consultant of the Berman Jewish DataBank.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishdatabank.org/About/staff.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berman Jewish DataBank was founded as the North American Jewish Data Bank in 1986 and operated under that name until July 2013.  Funded throughout that time by the Berman Foundation under an arrangement with the Jewish Federation system, the North American Jewish Data Bank was located at the City University of New York from 1986 until 2002, at Brandeis University (2003-04) and the University of Connecticut (2004-2013) before moving to JFNA and changing names as of July 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3007">The '''Boskin Commission''', formally called the "Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index", was appointed by the [[United States Senate]] in 1995 to study possible bias in the computation of the [[Consumer Price Index]] (CPI), which is used to measure [[inflation]] in the United States.  Its final report, titled "Toward A More Accurate Measure Of The Cost Of Living" and issued on December 4, 1996, concluded that the CPI overstated inflation by about 1.1 percentage points per year in 1996 and about 1.3 percentage points prior to 1996. 

The report was important because inflation, as calculated by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], is used to [[index (economics)|index]] the annual payment increases in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and other retirement and compensation programs.  This implied that the federal budget had increased by more than it should have, and that projections of future [[budget deficits]] were too large.  The original report calculated that the overstatement of inflation would add $148 billion to the deficit and $691 billion to the national debt by 2006.

The report highlighted four sources of possible bias:
* ''[[Substitution bias]]'' occurs because a fixed market basket fails to reflect the fact that consumers substitute relatively less for more expensive goods when [[relative price]]s change.
* ''Outlet substitution bias'' occurs when shifts to lower price outlets are not properly handled.
* ''Quality change bias'' occurs when improvements in the quality of products, such as greater energy efficiency or less need for repair, are measured inaccurately or not at all.
* ''New product bias'' occurs when new products are not introduced in the market basket, or included only with a long lag.

The members of the Boskin Commission were:
* [[Michael Boskin]], Stanford University (Chair)
* [[Ellen R. Dulberger]]
* [[Robert J. Gordon]]
* [[Zvi Griliches]]
* [[Dale Jorgenson]]

The Boskin Commission was the first extensive evaluation of inflation measurement since the [[Stigler Commission]] in 1961. Griliches was also on that commission.

As innovation cannot be measured using a biased factor, a commercial solution has had to be found.

The '''Centre for the Study of Developing Societies''' ('''CSDS''') is an [[India]]n research institute for the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]]. It was founded in 1963 by [[Rajni Kothari]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india-seminar.com/1999/481/481%20kothari.htm |title=Personally speaking: Rajni Kothari|publisher=India-seminar.com |date=30 March 2009 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is largely funded by the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]] Govt of India.&lt;ref name="csds.in"&gt;[http://www.csds.in/index.php?inc=aboutCSDS About CSDS], CSDS website, 30 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[New Delhi]], close to [[Delhi University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csds.in/index.php?inc=location |title=Getting to CSDS |publisher=Csds.in |date= |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Overview==
Kothari left his position as assistant director of the National Institute of Community Development in 1963 to start the CSDS. It was housed initially in a building owned by the Indian Adult Education Association at Indraprastha Estate, Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview Rajni Kothari, The Centre and Indian reality |url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2012/639/639_interview_kothari.htm# |publisher=Seminar |date=2012 |accessdate=2014-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CSDS later moved in 1966-1967 to its present location.

==Library==
The library at CSDS started with a few bookshelves in the basement of IAEA and grew up into a full-fledged one by 1970. It is meant primarily for research and higher learning in the field of social sciences and humanities. The collection consists of about 29,000 books and 5,000 bound volumes of journals and a modest set of reports and booklets. More than 130 journals are received regularly. Apart from works on contemporary themes, the library houses a collection of works on Asia and Africa, arms race and peace movement, non-European perspectives, science studies, ecology and environment, and human rights. There is a separate collection of Hindi books covering a broad range of subjects including literature. The access to the collection has been computerized and the catalogue can be accessed through any computer in the centre. The CSDS library is a member of the [[Developing Libraries Network]] and the [[Social Science Libraries Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csds.in/index.php?inc=library |title=CSDS - Centre for the Study of Developing Societies |publisher=Csds.in |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data unit==
The CSDS Data Unit, established in 1965, maintains an archive of survey data on political behaviour and attitudes, spanning over four decades. The unit also holds a number of secondary data sets, especially on elections in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csds.in/data_unit.htm |title=CSDS |publisher=Csds.in |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15867">[[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]] are a prevalent feature of [[Arab]] culture and politics. Prof. Matthew Gray writes they "are a common and popular phenomenon." "Conspiracism is an important phenomenon in understanding Arab [[Middle Eastern]] politics ..."&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;{{cite book|title=Conspiracy Theories in the Arab World|author=Matthew Gray|isbn=978-0415575188|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variants include conspiracies involving colonialism, [[Zionism]], superpowers, oil, and the [[war on terrorism]], which may be referred to as a [[War against Islam]].&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; [[Roger Cohen]] theorizes that the popularity of [[conspiracy theories]] in the Arab world is "the ultimate refuge of the powerless",&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/21/opinion/21iht-edcohen21.html|title=The Captive Arab Mind|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|author=[[Roger Cohen]]|date=Dec 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Al-Mumin Said noted the danger of such theories in that they "keep us not only from the truth but also from confronting our faults and problems..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/stalinsky200405060835.asp|title=A Vast Conspiracy|date=May 6, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004220251/http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/stalinsky200405060835.asp|archivedate=October 4, 2013|publisher=National Review|author=Steven Stalinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gray points out that actual conspiracies such as the British-French-Israeli 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] encourage speculation and creation of imagined conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Gray|2010|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Six-Day War|1967 war]], conspiracy theories became popular. The war was perceived as a conspiracy by Israel and the US—or its opposite: a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] plot to bring Egypt into the Soviet sphere of influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Gray|2010|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Friedman notes the numerous conspiracy theories concerning the [[Lebanese civil war]]. They "were usually the most implausible, wild-eyed conspiracy theories one could imagine ... Israelis, the [[Syria]]ns, the Americans, the Soviets, or [[Henry Kissinger]]—anyone but the Lebanese—in the most elaborate plots to disrupt Lebanon's naturally tranquil state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Beirut to Jerusalem|author=[[Thomas L. Friedman]]|year=1998|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal-related conspiracy theories===
{{see also|Israel-related animal conspiracy theories}}
Animal-related conspiracy theories involving Israel are prominent, alleging use of animals by Israel to attack civilians or to conduct espionage. These conspiracies are often reported as evidence of a Zionist or Israeli plot. Examples include the [[2010 Sharm el-Sheikh shark attacks|December 2010 shark attacks in Egypt]] and the 2011 capture in [[Saudi Arabia]] of a [[griffon vulture]] carrying an Israeli-labeled [[GPS wildlife tracking|satellite tracking device]].&lt;ref name="Discover"&gt;{{cite web| title=Shark Attack in Egypt? Must Be the Work of Israeli Agents|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/2010/12/13/shark-attack-in-egypt-must-be-the-work-of-israeli-agents/|publisher=Discovery Magazine|date=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=198286 |title=Egypt: Sinai shark attacks could be Israel... JPost - Middle East |first=ARIEH |last=O’SULLIVAN |work=jpost.com|date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Times]]'', [[James Hider]] linked the responses to the shark incident with those to the vulture incident and ascribed the reactions in Arab countries to "paranoia among Israel's enemies and its nominal friends", adding that "evidence of Mossad using animals is scant."&lt;ref name=australian&gt;{{cite news|title=Vulture held as Mossad spy by Saudi Arabia

[[Gil Yaron]] wrote in ''[[The Toronto Star]]'' that "Many animals undoubtedly serve in Israel’s army and security services: dogs sniff out bombs and alpaca help mountaineers carry their loads. [...] But tales about the use of sharks, birds, rodents or, as has also been claimed, insects in the service of the military are more the fruit of imagination than hard fact."&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news|title=Secret agent vulture tale just the latest in animal plots|url = https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/916624--secret-agent-vulture-tale-just-the-latest-in-animal-plots|page=|publisher = [[Toronto Star]]|author= Gil Yaron |date=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conspiracy theorists in the Arab world have advanced rumors that the US is secretly behind the existence and emboldening of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], as part of an attempt to further destabilize the Middle East. After such rumors became widespread, the US embassy in Lebanon issued an official statement denying the allegations, calling them a complete fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28745990 The US, IS and the conspiracy theory sweeping Lebanon].

==The "War against Islam" conspiracy==
{{Main|War against Islam}}
"[[War against Islam]]", also called the "War on Islam" or "Attack on Islam", is a conspiracy theory narrative in [[Islamism|Islamist]] discourse to describe an alleged conspiracy to harm, weaken or annihilate the societal system of [[Islam]], using [[military]], [[economic]], [[social]] and [[cultural]] means. The perpetrators of the conspiracy are alleged to be [[Kafir|non-Muslims]], particularly the [[Western world]] and "[[Munafiq|false Muslims]]", allegedly in collusion with political actors in the [[Western world]]. While the contemporary conspiracy theory narrative of the "War against Islam" mostly covers general issues of societal transformations in [[Islam and modernity|modernization]] and [[Islam and secularism|secularization]] as well as general issues of international power politics among modern states, the [[Crusades]] are often narrated as its alleged starting point.

==Other conspiracies==
After the fall of Morsi, xenophobic conspiracy theories have singled out Palestinians and Syrian refugees as part of a plot to bring the Muslim Brotherhood back to power. Pro-Morsi supporters single out Saudis and Emiratis as part of a counter conspiracy.&lt;ref name=atlantic20130912/&gt;

A common conspiracy theory is about soft drink brands [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]], that the drinks deliberately contain pork and alcohol and their names carry pro-Israel and anti-Islamic messages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110224010645/http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000624838&amp;fid=942 Israeli sues Coca Cola for containing alcohol]&lt;BR&gt;Globes, Israel Business News, February 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040803095638/http://www2.coca-cola.com/contactus/myths_rumors/middle_east.html Myths &amp; Rumors/Middle East]&lt;BR&gt;Official Coca-Cola website, August 3, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/1760.htm Interview with Hamas MP Salem Salamah - Al Aqsa TV], April 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copilco''' was an important Mesoamerican ceremonial center, southwest of [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]. Copilco is located approximately four kilometers north of [[Cuicuilco]]. Both were covered by lava from several eruptions of the [[Xitle]] volcano three thousand years ago.

It is very likely that founding, development and destiny of both cities had common causes, from their geographical location, and chronology.

The area is located on the west side of [[Coyoacán]] or Coyohuacán ([[Nahuatl]]: coyō-hua-cān, 'place of coyotes') in the area covered by the lava from the [[Xitle]] volcano (according to Chronicles, one eruption of the volcano occurred on April 24, 76).

== Founding==
There are several theories regarding its founding; some historical records may establish Copilco's founding in the year 100 BCE.&lt;ref name= "  Inegi" &gt;{{cite web |first=  |last=  |title=  Hechos históricos relevantes |url= http://mapserver.inegi.gob.mx/geografia/espanol/estados/df/df-it.cfm?c=590&amp;e=09 |publisher= INEGI |location=  |language= Spanish |trans-title=Relevant historical facts  |year= |accessdate= October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version places it at 500 BCE.&lt;ref name="  Rincon" &gt;{{cite web |first=   |last=  |title=  Precolombinas (Culturas y Ciudades) |url= http://html.rincondelvago.com/precolombinas-culturas-y-ciudades.html |publisher=[[Rincon del Vago]] |location= |language= Spanish|trans-title=|year= |accessdate=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background==
Copilco was one of the first and most important ceremonial centers in the Valley of Mexico. In the mid-Preclassical (800 BC), several villages developed in this place and slowly evolved and grew, becoming cities and eventually major civic-ceremonial urban centers in the late-preclassical period (ca. 100 CE.). As urban centers, these were very important, with an advanced and hierarchized society. Copilco's decline began early in the 1st century BCE, with the increasing rise of [[Teotihuacán]] as an important cultural and religious center. By 400 CE, the [[Xitle]] volcano near the Ajusc erupted, burying and destroying what still remained of [[Cuicuilco]] and Copilco as important ceremonial centers. Lava spread in an area of 13 by 15 kilometers of what is today known as “Pedregal de San Ángel”.&lt;ref name=Rincon  /&gt; This disaster dispersed the population to [[Toluca]] and Teotihuacan.&lt;ref name="Cuicuilco y Copilco" &gt;{{cite journal |last= Durón García |first=   Carlos |date=March 8, 2009  |title= Recopilaciones |trans_title=  |journal=  El Sol de México |location=  |url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldemexico/notas/n1075875.htm|language=Spanish |accessdate=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copilco was an [[Altépetl|altépetl]] and ceremonial center located on the shores of the Texcoco Lake. It had an incipient agriculture with an economy based on [[maize]], hunting and fishing&lt;ref name=Rincon  /&gt; and the inhabitants supplemented their diet with amphibians, insects and mammals from the nearby forest. This area was explored by Dr. Manuel Gamio in 1917&lt;ref&gt;according to the Encyclopedia of Mexico, special 1987 edition&lt;/ref&gt; and a burial site was found covered by lava from the eruption. Gamio made three tunnels under the lava, finding a cultural sequence and bone remains from three individuals, containing offerings consisting of pottery, vessels, clay figurines, and [[Metate]]s. Human remains are known as the “Hombre del Pedregal”. Several tunnels have been made, finding places with corpses occupying their original location, surrounded by [[grave goods|funerary offerings]] items, such as ceramic ware.&lt;ref name=Rincon  /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Tepanecapan II.JPEG|thumb|Maximum Tepaneca Expansion.]]
It is very likely that there were several population eras, for all areas of the Valley of Mexico, which could be related to the different cultures that inhabited the area at different times, and the results of the different wars, conquests and alliances. It will be necessary for specialists and scholars to conclude their important research and build an up-to-date overview of the history of the Valley of Mexico. There is evidence of occupation of this area since the Preclassical period.

In the specific case of Copilco, from what is known, it is estimated that at during the late prehispanic Mesoamerican chronology (1332), Copilco was tributary to [[Azcapotzalco]], and therefore the Tepanec, who in turn were somehow descendants of the [[Chichimec]]s.

The [[Tepanec]]s formed a culture with political, social and military organization; settled in Azcapotzalco, they dominated minor villages establishing their culture in Coyoacan around 1332 CE. Their growth continued by their taking of other villages: Copilco, Quiahuac ("Los Reyes"), Xotepingo, Tepetlapan and Coapan.

===Tepanecs===
Tepaneca can be translated as “the stone People”.&lt;ref&gt;As proposed by Seler, quoted by Nigel Davies, in The Toltec Heritage. From the fall of Tula to the Rise of Tenochtitlan. University of Oklahoma Press, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is supported by the fact that the Tepanec Glyph appears on several documents ([[Aztec codices|Boturini Codex]] or “Tira de la peregrinación”, [[Codex Azcatitlan|Azcatitlan]] and [[Codex Xolotl|Xolotl Codexes]]), which, associated with the ''calli'' glyph, portray the idea of a “nation” or human group, appear one of the most normalized Nahuatl glyphs, the one meaning "piedra" (stone).

Name is a derivation of the real people name, from their original mythic city, Tepanohuayan "the pasadero", also called Tepano whose name is tepaneca (tl). Graphically it is represented by a stone, hence the etymology of Tepan is created "on the stones".&lt;ref&gt;In fact there are no known places called "Tepan". Tepanohuayan however, in addition to its concept as a mythical place, is used in colonial documents to refer to several tepanecas cities; this is how references are made of Azcapotzalco-Tepanohuayan, Tlacopan-Tepanohuayan, Coyohuacan-Tepanohuayan, and even near Atlacuihuayan there was a town with that name. Perhaps its value is due to the condition of being on the eastern shore of the Texcoco Lake, at the place where people boarded a vessel to cross (pasar) to the other side.&lt;/ref&gt; Tepanec conquered territories were called “Tepanecapan” (“tepanecas land", literally "over the tepanecas").

===Origin===
According to chronicler [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl]] (1568–1648), this was a [[Chichimec]] group, that settled in 1012 CE in the western region of the Texcoco Lake. Their lineage begins when their leader Acolhua marries [[Cuetlaxochitzin]], daughter of [[Xólotl]], another Chichimeca leader.

[[Chimalpahin|Domingo Francisco de San Antón Muñón Chimalpahin Quauhtlehuanitzin]] (1579–1660) establishes this settlement before, at 995 CE. In fact archaeological investigations have revealed that [[Azcapotzalco]] was inhabited from the classical period (around 600 CE) and were related to the Teotihuacan’s in culture and language, as it is known the spoke otomíana language in the 14th century while the Nahuatl was lingua franca from 1272. Continuing with data provided by Chimalpain, he mentions that the tepanecas entered a triple alliance from 1047 (this alliance is different from that with the Mexicas, much later).

The Register establish that the last lineage begins with [[Matlacohuatl]],&lt;ref&gt;Actually these rulers' names come from two sources; The García Granados Codex illustrates the lineage of Azcapotzalco (without dates) in the following order: Maxtlacozcatl (Matlacohuatl), Chiconquiauitl, Tezcapoctli, "Tehuehuactzin Micacalcatl, Xiuhtlatonac", Acolnahuacatl and Tezozomoc; the Tlatelolco annals provide another list in which the first three and the last two names appear but misses the other three, the advantage of this list is that it provides dates. The three missing names could be accommodated in an alternate sequence, taking into account data from other sources that placed the rise of Acolnahuacatl in 1302, with a "brief blank" from 1283 to 1302, although not suggested by any other document.&lt;/ref&gt; who ruled from 1152 to 1222, married to Cuitlachtepetl. The second ''[[tlatoani]]'' was [[Chiconquiauhtzin]], married to [[Xicomoyahual]], daughter of Ohpantzin.

He was succeeded by Tezcapoctzin, who ruled from 1248 to 1283. In his time the [[Mexitli|mexitin]] appeared, who requested permission to found their second capital on the islet of Lake Texcoco; it was originally named Cuauhmixtitlan in 1274. With his rule Tepaneca military expansion began, establishing partnerships with the [[Acolhua]] in the Valley of Mexico, the mazahuaques in the Ixtlahuaca Valley and the matlatzincas in the Toluca Valley, while acquiring a great commercial power. In 1272 he accepted the substitution of Coatlinchan by [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Tetzcoco]] in the Triple Alliance of that time, thus consolidating the achievements of his predecessor.

===Language===
Their language probably had [[Uto-Aztecan languages]]  and [[Oto-Manguean languages]] roots.

However, from the information recollection by Spaniards as of 1521, some sparse information is available about the languages spoken in different Tepanecas cities. Fray Bernardino de Sahagún includes Tepanecas among Nahuatl speaker groups although this claim seems rather a –synchronous, non-historical- attempt, of describing ethnical conditions in times near the Spaniard presence, it is known that the consolidation of major political units of the Central Highlands, also entailed the Nahuatl acceptance as a common pipiltin language of the different altépetl.

===Chichimecs===
The [[Chichimec]] (Dog lineage or Arc warriors), was a culture which controlled priests, by putting pressure on social nobility which was almost always military and oppressive. These were nomadic groups nourished from hunting, then learned to eat cooked meat and maize; cultivated beans, corn, pumpkin, nopales, oilseeds, among other things. They believed in various gods as Quetzalcoatl, Tezcatlipoca, Mimixcotal and Mixcoatl. They thought that the stars were warriors killed in battles, honoring the Sun.&lt;ref name=Rincon  /&gt;

They continued the Toltec art as can be seen in the [[Tenayuca]] pyramid. As well as their sculpture as for example the "Espejo de la Cruz", the mantle braided with fur and various ceramic figures. Left the great Tenayuca pyramid as cultural contribution. The chichimeca disappeared since the Tepanec defeated and the only leader left was Netzahualcoyotl who fled with the tlaxcaltecas.&lt;ref name=Rincon  /&gt;

==Site ==
[[Manuel Gamio]] recounts the following: "... in the month of August 1917..." the staff proceeded to make a methodical recognition all quarries being exploited... realizing that where more items were available, was at Copilco, bordering “Colonia del Carmen in [[San Ángel]] ".

From that place many archaeological vestiges and human remains were extracted. He noted:

The archaeological vestiges discovered in four tunnels that were excavated in Copilco can be categorized in three groups: 1° Sepulcher;" 2 ° Pavements and stone rows; 3 ° Objects of mud and stone.

The tombs consist of cylindrical hollows excavated in [[tepetate]]...

Not all skeletons were buried in cylindrical graves... also found bones inside a vase"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16606">'''Cultural group selection''' is an explanatory model within [[cultural evolution]] of how cultural traits evolve according to the competitive advantage they bestow upon a group. This multidisciplinary approach to the question of human culture engages research from the fields of [[anthropology]], [[behavioural economics]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[evolutionary game theory]], [[sociology]], and [[psychology]].

While cultural norms are often beneficial to the individuals who hold them, they need not be.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. "The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race." Discover Magazine. May. 64-66. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Norms can spread by cultural group selection when they are practiced within successful groups, and norms are more likely to spread from groups that are successful. But, for cultural group selection to occur, there must exist, between groups, cultural differences that when transmitted across time affect the persistence or proliferation of the groups.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell, D.T. Variation and selective retention in sociocultural evolution. Social change in developing areas: A reinterpretation of evolutionary theory. Cambridge: Schenkman. 1965. 19-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural norms that provide these advantages will, in turn, lead to the displacement, absorption or even extinction of other, less successful cultural groups.&lt;ref name="sol" &gt;Soltis, J., Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1995. Can group-functional behaviours evolve by cultural group selection? An empirical test. Current Anthropology 36 (3), 473–494.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[game theory|game theoretic]] models suggest that if individuals are able to migrate between groups (which is common in small-scale societies), differences between groups should be difficult to maintain.&lt;ref name="joe" &gt;Henrich, J. Cultural group selection, coevolutionary processes and large-scale cooperation. Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization. Volume 53, Issue 1, January 2004, 3–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Research in psychology reveals that humans have a particular set of traits, which include [[imitation]], [[conformity]], and [[in-group bias]], that are capable of supporting the maintenance of these group differences over extended periods of time.

Cultural group selection gives a compelling explanation for how large-scale complex societies have formed. While altruistic behaviour such as [[kin selection]] and [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]] can explain the behaviour of small social groups common in many species, it is unable to explain the large complex societies of unrelated, anonymous individuals that we see in the human species.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt; However, one of the major distinctions between humans and other species is our reliance on [[Observational learning|social learning]] in acquiring behaviours.&lt;ref name="chimp"&gt;Horner, V. Whiten, A. Causal knowledge and imitation/emulation switching in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and children (Homo sapiens). Animal Cognition (2005) 8: 164–181&lt;/ref&gt; These instincts allow for the acquisition and persistence of culture.&lt;ref name="tomasello"&gt;Tomasello, M. The Human Adaptation for Culture. Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 28, (1999), pp. 509-529&lt;/ref&gt; Through cultural group selection, culturally specific cooperative behaviour can evolve to support large societies.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt; For example, in a study that spanned a variety of cultures, testing behaviour in [[Ultimatum game|Ultimatum]], [[Dictator game|Dictator]], and [[Third-party punishment]] games, it was found that standards of fairness and inclination to punish were correlated with both participation in world religions and market integration.&lt;ref&gt;Henrich, J., et al. Markets, Religion, Community Size, and the Evolution of Fairness and Punishment. Science 327, 1480 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates how many of the behaviours necessary for complex societies are the result of cultural exposure rather than any evolution of our psychology.

== Human adaptations for culture ==
For cultural knowledge and behaviour to persist across multiple generations, humans need to have the capacity to acquire, retain, and transmit cultural information. While many species engage in social learning, humans consistently rely upon it for behavioural cues and information about the environment. In a study comparing human children and young chimpanzees, it was shown that, when given a demonstration on how to retrieve a reward from a box, chimps copy relevant behaviour, while ignoring irrelevant behaviour, to solve the task. Meanwhile, human children will faithfully imitate both relevant and irrelevant behaviour to solve the same task.&lt;ref name="chimp" /&gt; While this may seem like a negative quality, it is what allows for reliable, high-fidelity transmission of cultural information, and produces stable behavioural equilibria within cultural groups.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt;

[[Michael Tomasello]] suggests the following three adaptations are necessary for human culture:&lt;ref name="tomasello" /&gt;

=== Joint attention ===
At around 9–12 months infants begin engaging in [[joint attention]]. This involves following the gaze of an adult or using them as social reference points. Put simply, they become aware of the adult's attention and behaviour towards objects in the environment. In this sense, the child is beginning to understand people as goal-oriented intentional agents. This is vitally important for learning through imitation and, eventually, language acquisition.

=== Imitative learning ===
By about 1 year of age, children begin to learn by imitation. At this point, children are capable of discriminating intentional actions from unintentional ones, and will attempt to accurately copy those intentional actions to accomplish tasks they've seen adults do. Because of [[imitative learning]], children will copy those intentional acts which have no perceivable effect on the outcome,&lt;ref name="chimp" /&gt; as well as strange or unnatural actions when easier methods are available. For example, an [[Andrew Meltzoff]] study found that 14-month-old children will, after seeing an adult do it, bend at the waist and press a panel with their head to turn on a light, instead of using their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Meltzoff A. 1988. Infant imitation after a one-week delay: long term memory for novel acts and multiple stimuli. Dev. Psychol. 24:470-76&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tomasello, imitative learning is necessary for learning the symbolic conventions of language.

=== Linguistic symbols and cognitive representation ===
Through imitatively learning, the child comprehends that linguistic symbols are intended to focus attention to some specific aspect of the shared experience. In doing this, the child must be able to take the perspective of the speaker. Due to the intersubjectivity of linguistic symbols, language allows one to communicate various perspectives and shift attention to one aspect of the world over another. In learning a language, a child is inheriting a vast set of linguistic symbols that have been passed down many generations. What is inherited then is the methods of shifting attention and perspective that were historically of importance to the people of that culture.

== Mechanisms that maintain between-group variation ==
Without between-group variation, cultural group selection could not occur, as there would be no group differentiation to select for. While processes such as cultural drift, epidemics, and natural disasters increase between-group variation, migration and genetic mixing decrease between-group variation ''and'' increase within-group variation. Variation is only maintained when cultural groups have mechanisms that prevent the norms of outside groups from invading the cultural group. These ‘mechanisms’ are those uniquely human psychological traits and behaviours that encourage imitation, conformity, and in-group biases.

According to [[Joseph Henrich]], between-group variation is maintained by the following four mechanisms:&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt;

=== Conformist transmission ===
Conformist transmission refers to the psychological bias to preferentially imitate high frequency behaviors in the cultural group. This homogenizes the social group and reinforces widely held cultural norms. This explains why individuals within a social group hold the same beliefs and why these beliefs persist over time. While individuals will rely on copying high frequency behaviors under various conditions, this reliance increases when an individual is exposed to ambiguous environmental or social information.&lt;ref name="Boyd85"&gt;Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1985. Culture and the Evolutionary Process. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, G., Fudenberg, D., 1993. Rules of thumb for social learning. Journal of Political Economy 101 (4),
612–643.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baron, R., Vandello, J., Brunsman, B., 1996. The forgotten variable in conformity research: impact of task
importance on social influence. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 71 (5), 915–927.&lt;/ref&gt; Conformist transmission can maintain between-group variation by reducing within-group variation, but it also facilitates the rapid spread of novel ideas, which increases between-group variation.&lt;ref name="Boyd85" /&gt; Taken together, reduced within-group variation and increased between-group variation lead to the cultural divergence between groups that is the driving force of cultural group selection.

=== Prestige-biased and self-similarity transmission ===
Prestige-biased transmission is the tendency the copy those members of the group that are more successful. Preferentially copying successful members of the group allows individuals to avoid costly trial-and-error learning by imitating the better-than-average skills of the more prestigious cultural models. Individual can determine the rank of potential models by how much deference they are shown by the rest of the group. Deference is shown to high-prestige individuals to gain the opportunity to copy their successful models. We can see evidence for this bias in how new technologies, or economic practices spread to different groups according to how quick "opinion leaders" adopt them.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E.M., 1995. Diffusion of Innovations. Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[self-similarity]] transmission is the tendency to copy those individuals who are similar in language, appearance, social standing and other behavioral and cultural traits. In the context of prestige-biased transmission, self-similarity means that individuals will preferentially imitate those high-prestige individuals who are similar to them. From the perspective of an imitator, this trait is adaptive. By only imitating those high-prestige individuals who are similar, the imitator avoids adopting traits or behaviors that are not compatible with his or her knowledge or social environment.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1987. The evolution of ethnic markers. Cultural Anthropology 2 (1), 27–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

These two social biases act together in reducing within-group variation. Additionally, prestige-biased transmission increases between-group variation by contributing to the spread of novel ideas.&lt;ref name="Boyd85" /&gt;

=== Punishment of non-conformists ===
Non-conformists threaten to increase within-group variation by introducing deviant behaviours to the group and must receive costly punishment to maintain a homogenous social group. As a consequence of being punished, non-conformists will be less successful than other members of the group. Prestige-biased transmission would suggest that non-conformist behaviors would, therefore, not spread through the population. Papers on the topic suggest that this kind of punishment is prevalent across many different societies.&lt;ref&gt;Sober, E., Wilson, D.S., 1998. Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior. Harvard
University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth, A.E., Prasnikar, V., Okuno-Fujiwara, M., Zamir, S., 1991. Bargaining and market behavior in Jerusalem, Ljubljana, Pittsburgh and Tokyo: an experimental study, Pittsburgh and Tokyo: an experimental study. American Economic Review 81 (5), 1068–1095.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henrich, J., Boyd, R., Bowles, S., Gintis, H., Camerer, C., Fehr, E., McElreath, R., 2001. In search of Homo economicus: experiments in 15 small-scale societies. American Economic Review 91, 73–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, E., Gächter, S., 2002. Altruistic punishment in humans. Nature 415, 137–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normative conformity ===
Normative conformity is the act of changing one’s visible behaviour, simply to appear to match the majority, and without actually internalizing the groups opinions. This differs from conformist transmission since normative conformity does not consider frequency of a behaviour as an indicator of worth. The [[Asch conformity experiments]] are a perfect example of how robust this effect is&lt;ref&gt;Asch, S.E., 1951. Effects of group pressure upon the modification and distortion of judgments. In: Guetzkow, H. (Ed.), Groups, Leadership and Men. Carnegie, Pittsburgh, pp. 177–190.&lt;/ref&gt; and its replication across many cultures shows that this behaviour is very common.&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A., 1984. Studies of cross-cultural conformity: a brief and critical review. Psychologia: An International
Journal of Psychology in the Orient 27 (1), 65–72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neto, F., 1995. Conformity and independence revisited. Social Behavior and Personality 23 (3), 217–222.&lt;/ref&gt; Henrich suggests that normative conformity may have evolved to respond to the spread of punishing behaviour toward non-conformists.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt; By appearing similar to the group, one can gain the advantages of in-group membership, while also avoiding punishment. A curious byproduct of normative conformity is that it can contribute to the conformity transmission of norms that the transmitter does not hold, because they were mistakenly attributed by the imitator.

== Mechanisms ==
As [[Donald T. Campbell]] says, for cultural group selection to occur, there must be cultural differences between groups which affect their persistence or proliferation.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt; This means groups are selected ''for'' or ''against'' according to their respective ''gains'' or ''losses'' relative to other groups.

Joseph Henrich describes the three mechanisms through which this process occurs:&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt;

=== Demographic swamping ===
Demographic swamping occurs when one or more cultural groups reproduces individuals faster than other groups in the region because of stable, culturally transmitted ideas or practices.  This is the slowest kind of cultural groups selection as it depends on natural selection of between-group cultural variation operating on a scale of millennia. It has been suggested that this is how early agriculturalist displaced hunter-gatherer societies.&lt;ref&gt;Cavalli-Sforza, L.L., Menozzi, P., Piazza, A., 1994. The History and Geography of Human Genes. Princeton
University Press, Princeton, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young and Bettinger, 1992Young, D., Bettinger, R.L., 1992. The numic spread: a computer simulation. American Antiquity 57 (1), 85–99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, J.M., 1997. Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct intergroup competition ===
Direct intergroup competition is the process by which cultural groups compete with each other over resources by engaging in warfare and raiding. The cultural practices and behaviour that gives an advantage to one group over another will proliferate at the expense of those who cannot compete. There are many possible traits that could contribute to a group's success, such as technological development, social and political organization, economic development, nationalism, etc. According to Joseph Soltis, it would take 500–1000 years for group selection to happen this way.&lt;ref name="sol" /&gt;

=== Prestige-biased group selection ===
In prestige-biased group selection, when individuals have opportunities to copy people from nearby groups, they will preferentially imitate the members of groups that are more cooperative than their own. Since cooperative groups have a higher average payoff than non-cooperative groups, members of cooperative groups will be considered more prestigious and worthy of imitation.

'''Distributism''' is an [[economic ideology]] asserting that the world's productive assets should be widely owned rather than concentrated.&lt;ref name=Zwick/&gt; It was developed in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries based upon the principles of [[Catholic social teaching]], especially the teachings of [[Pope Leo XIII]] in his [[encyclical]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891) and [[Pope Pius XI]] in ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' (1931).&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Michael (2007). ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Social Thought, Social Science and Social Policy''. [[Scarecrow Press]]. p. 85. {{ISBN|978-0-8108-5906-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McConkey, Dale; Lawler, Peter (2003). ''Faith, Morality, and Civil Society''. [[Lexington Books]]. p. 50. {{ISBN|978-0-7391-0483-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Allitt|Allitt, Patrick]] (2000). ''Catholic Converts: British and American Intellectuals Turn to Rome''. [[Cornell University Press]]. p. 206. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-8663-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It views both [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] as equally flawed and exploitative, and it favors economic mechanisms such as small-scale [[cooperative]]s and [[family business]]es, and large-scale [[competition law|anti-trust regulations]].

Some [[Christian Democratic]] political parties have advocated distributism in their economic policies.
&lt;!--

In the early 21st century, some observers speculated on [[Pope Francis]]'s position on distributism after he denounced unfettered capitalism in his apostolic exhortation ''[[Evangelii gaudium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/pope-francis-needs-distributism/|title=Pope Francis Needs Distributism|website=theamericanconservative.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.acton.org/archives/67566-pope-doesnt-need-distributism-nobody.html|title=No, the Pope Doesn’t Need Distributism (Because Nobody Does)|date=4 April 2014|website=acton.org|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skellmeyer.blogspot.com/2013/11/pope-francis-condemns-distributism.html|title=The Fifth Column: Pope Francis Condemns Distributism|first=Steve|last=Kellmeyer|date=28 November 2013|website=skellmeyer.blogspot.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicozarks.blogspot.com/2013/11/pope-francis-is-distributist.html|title=Catholic in the Ozarks: Is Pope Francis a Distributist?|first=Shane|last=Schaetzel|date=26 November 2013|website=catholicozarks.blogspot.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2013/11/lets-listen-to-pope-francis-on-economics|title=Let’s Listen to Pope Francis on Economics - Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry|website=firstthings.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2014/04/pope-francis-distributism/|title=Pope Francis and Distributism|website=www.frontporchrepublic.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onreligion.co.uk/neither-capitalism-nor-communism-distributism/Neither|title=Neither Capitalism nor Communism: Distributism|date=15 April 2014|website=onreligion.co.uk|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Evangelii gaudium]]'', quote: "Just as the commandment 'Thou shalt not kill' sets a clear limit in order to safeguard the value of human life, today we also have to say 'thou shalt not' to an economy of exclusion and inequality. Such an economy kills... A new tyranny is thus born, invisible and often virtual, which unilaterally and relentlessly imposes its own laws and rules. To all this we can add widespread corruption and self-serving tax evasion, which has taken on worldwide dimensions. The thirst for power and possessions knows no limits."&lt;/ref&gt;

I commented out this section. If there should, one time, be a future "Distributism and the Catholic Magisterium" section, we can put it there; so I have not deleted the sources put here together. Still, all in all the well-sourced statement is that the present Pope has criticized Capitalism (as have all Popes before him, but I digress), and that some observers have taken this as occasion to speculate on his stand towards Distributism. In other words: a rather long sentence with preciously little actual content. "Some observers speculated". For a ''lead'' it is entirely out of place.

==Overview==

According to distributists, [[private property|property]] ownership is a fundamental right,&lt;ref&gt;Shiach, Morag (2004). ''Modernism, Labour and Selfhood in British Literature and Culture, 1890-1930''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. p. 224. {{ISBN|978-0-521-83459-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[means of production]] should be spread as widely as possible, rather than being centralized under the control of the state ([[state capitalism]]/[[state socialism]]), a few individuals ([[plutocracy]]), or corporations ([[corporatocracy]]). Distributism, therefore, advocates a society marked by widespread property ownership.&lt;ref name=Zwick&gt;Zwick, Mark and Louise (2004). ''The Catholic Worker Movement: Intellectual and Spiritual Origins ''. [[Paulist Press]]. p. 156. {{ISBN|978-0-8091-4315-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Co-operatives|Co-operative]] economist [[Race Mathews]] argues that such a system is key to bringing about a just [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibson-Graham, J.K. (2006). ''A Postcapitalist Politics''. [[University of Minnesota Press]]. p. 224. {{ISBN|978-0-8166-4804-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Distributism has often been described in opposition to both [[socialism]] and [[capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, David; Simms, Andrew (2009). ''The New Economics''. [[Routledge]]. p. 20. {{ISBN|978-1-84407-675-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Novak, Michael; Younkins, Edward W. (2001). ''Three in One: Essays on Democratic Capitalism, 1976-2000''.

Some have seen it more as an aspiration, which has been successfully realised in the short term by commitment to the principles of [[subsidiarity]] and [[social solidarity|solidarity]] (these being built into financially independent local [[cooperative]]s and small [[family business]]es), though proponents also cite such periods as the [[Middle Ages]] as examples of the historical long-term viability of distributism.&lt;ref&gt;Hilaire Belloc, "The Servile Institution Dissolved," ''The Servile State'', (1913; reprint, Indianapolis, IN: Liberty Fund, 1977), 71-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly influential in the development of distributist theory were [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] authors [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]],&lt;ref name="Prentiss, Craig R. 2008 p. 77"/&gt; the [[G. K.

==Background==

The mid-to-late 19th century witnessed an increase in popularity of [[political Catholicism]] across [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian (1993). ''Political Ideology Today''. Manchester University Press. p. 59-60. {{ISBN|978-0-7190-3347-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Michael A. Riff, a common feature of these movements was opposition not only to [[secularism]], but also to both capitalism and socialism.&lt;ref name="Riff, Michael A. 1990 p. 35"/&gt; In 1891 [[Pope Leo XIII]] promulgated ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', in which he addressed the "misery and wretchedness pressing so unjustly on the majority of the working class" and spoke of how "a small number of very rich men" had been able to "lay upon the teeming masses of the laboring poor a yoke little better than that of slavery itself".&lt;ref&gt;Leo XIII, ''Rerum novarum'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmed in the encyclical was the right of all men to own property,&lt;ref&gt;Leo XIII, ''Rerum novarum'',  6.&lt;/ref&gt; the necessity of a system that allowed "as many as possible of the people to become owners",&lt;ref name="Leo XIII, Rerum novarum, 46"&gt;Leo XIII, ''Rerum novarum'', 46.&lt;/ref&gt; the duty of employers to provide safe [[working conditions]]&lt;ref&gt;Leo XIII, ''Rerum novarum'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt; and sufficient wages,&lt;ref&gt;Leo XIII, ''Rerum novarum'', 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and the right of workers to [[Trade union|unionise]].&lt;ref name="Leo XIII, Rerum novarum, 49"&gt;Leo XIII, ''Rerum novarum'', 49.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Common ownership|Common]] and [[government ownership|government]] property ownership was expressly dismissed as a means of helping the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Leo XIII, ''Rerum novarum'', 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leo XIII, ''Rerum novarum'', 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the start of the 20th century, [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]] drew together the disparate experiences of the various cooperatives and [[friendly society|friendly societies]] in Northern England, Ireland, and Northern Europe into a coherent political ideology which specifically advocated widespread private ownership of housing and control of industry through owner-operated small businesses and worker-controlled cooperatives. In the United States in the 1930s, distributism was treated in numerous essays by Chesterton, Belloc and others in ''[[The American Review (literary journal)|The American Review]]'', published and edited by [[Seward Collins]]. Pivotal among Belloc's and Chesterton's other works regarding distributism are ''[[The Servile State]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Hilaire Belloc, ''The Servile State'', The Liberty Fund, originally published 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Outline of Sanity''.&lt;ref&gt;G. K. Chesterton, [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/Sanity.txt ''The Outline of Sanity''], IHS Press, 2002, originally published 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a majority of distributism's later supporters were not Catholics and many were in fact former [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] socialists who had become disillusioned with socialism, distributist thought was adopted by the [[Catholic Worker Movement]], conjoining it with the thought of [[Dorothy Day]] and [[Peter Maurin]] concerning localized and independent communities. It also influenced the thought behind the [[Antigonish Movement]], which implemented cooperatives and other measures to aid the poor in the Canadian [[Maritimes]]. Its practical implementation in the form of local cooperatives has been documented by [[Race Mathews]] in his 1999 book ''Jobs of Our Own: Building a Stakeholder Society''.

==Position within the political spectrum==
[[File:Triangle of economic systems.png|250px|thumb|Distributism is more than a compromise between socialism and capitalism.]]
[[File:William Cobbett.JPG|250px|thumb|[[William Cobbett]]'s social views influenced Chesterton.]]
The position of distributists when compared to other political philosophies is somewhat paradoxical and complicated (see [[Triangulation (politics)|Triangulation]]). Strongly entrenched in an [[Organic (model)|organic]] but very [[Catholic Church in England and Wales|English Catholicism]], advocating culturally traditionalist and [[agrarianism|agrarian]] values, directly challenging the precepts of [[Whig history]]—Belloc was nonetheless an MP for the Liberal Party and Chesterton once stated "As much as I ever did, more than I ever did, I believe in Liberalism. But there was a rosy time of innocence when I believed in Liberals."&lt;ref name="orthodoxy"&gt;{{cite book | last=Chesterton | first=G. K. | title=Orthodoxy | publisher=BiblioBazaar | year=2008 | page=49 | isbn=978-0-554-33475-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Wl2QyGUL0EC&amp;pg=PA49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[liberalism]] is different from most modern forms, taking influence from [[William Cobbett]] and [[John Ruskin]], who combined elements of [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]], challenging the establishment position, but from a perspective of renovation, not revolution; seeing themselves as trying to restore the traditional liberties of England and her people which had been taken away from them, amongst other things, since the [[Industrial Revolution]].

While converging with certain elements of traditional [[Toryism]], especially an appreciation of the [[Middle Ages]] and organic society, there were several points of significant contention. While many Tories were strongly opposed to reform, the distributists in certain cases saw this not as conserving a legitimate traditional concept of England, but in many cases, entrenching harmful errors and innovations. Belloc was quite explicit in his opposition to [[Protestantism]] as a concept and [[schism (religion)|schism]] from the Catholic Church in general, considering the division of [[Christendom]] in the 16th century one of the most harmful events in European history. Elements of Toryism on the other hand were quite intransigent when it came to the [[Church of England]] as the established church, some even spurning their original [[Legitimists|legitimist]] ultra-royalist principles in regards to [[James II of England|James II]] to uphold it.

Much of [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]' writings on social and economic matters has affinity with distributism. She may have been influenced by them, or have come to similar conclusions on her own; as an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], the reasonings she gave are rooted in the theologies of [[genesis creation narrative|Creation]] and [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], and thus are slightly different from the Catholic Chesterton and Belloc.

==Economic theory==

===Private property===
[[File:Three acres and a cow.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Self-portrait of [[G. K. Chesterton]] based on the distributist slogan "[[Three acres and a cow]]".]]
Under such a system, most people would be able to earn a living without having to rely on the use of the [[private property|property]] of others to do so. Examples of people earning a living in this way would be farmers who own their own land and related machinery, carpenters and plumbers who own their own tools, etc.  The "cooperative" approach advances beyond this perspective to recognise that such property and equipment may be "co-owned" by local communities larger than a family, e.g., partners in a business.

In ''Rerum novarum'', Leo XIII states that people are likely to work harder and with greater commitment if they themselves possess the land on which they labour, which in turn will benefit them and their families, as workers will be able to provide for themselves and their household. He puts forward the idea that when men have the opportunity to possess property and work on it, they will “learn to love the very soil which yields in response to the labor of their hands, not only food to eat, but an abundance of the good things for themselves and those that are dear to them”. &lt;ref&gt;Pope Leo XIII, ''Rerum novarum'' : 47, 1891&lt;/ref&gt; He states also that owning property is not only beneficial for a person and their family, but is in fact a right, due to God having “...given the earth for the use and enjoyment of the whole human race”.&lt;ref&gt;Pope Leo XIII, ''Rerum novarum'':  8, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar views are presented by [[G. K. Chesterton]] in his 1910 book ''What’s Wrong with the World''.  Chesterton believes that whilst God has limitless capabilities, man has limited abilities in terms of creation. As such, man therefore is entitled to own property and to treat it as he sees fit. He states “Property is merely the art of the democracy. It means that every man should have something that he can shape in his own image, as he is shaped in the image of heaven. But because he is not God, but only a graven image of God, his self-expression must deal with limits; properly with limits that are strict and even small.”&lt;ref&gt;Chesterton, Gilbert Keith, ''What’s Wrong with the World'' (1920), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Chesterton summed up his distributist views in the phrase "[[Three acres and a cow]]".

According to Belloc, the distributive state (the state which has implemented distributism) contains "an agglomeration of families of varying wealth, but by far the greater number of owners of the means of production". This broader distribution does not extend to all property, but only to productive property; that is, that property which produces wealth, namely, the things needed for man to survive. It includes land, tools, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Hilaire Belloc, ''[[The Servile State]]'', 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; Distributism allows for society to have public goods such as parks and transit systems.

===Guild system===
The kind of economic order envisaged by the early distributist thinkers would involve the return to some sort of [[guild]] system. The present existence of [[trade union|labor unions]] does not constitute a realization of this facet of distributist economic order, as labour unions are organized along [[Social class|class]] lines to promote class interests and frequently [[class struggle]], whereas guilds are mixed class syndicates composed of both employers and employees cooperating for mutual benefit, thereby promoting [[class collaboration]].

===Banks===
Distributism favors the dissolution of the current [[private bank]] system, or more specifically its [[Profit (economics)|profit]]-making basis in charging interest. Dorothy Day, for example, suggested&lt;ref&gt;Considine, Kevin. [https://www.uscatholic.org/articles/201603/it-sinful-charge-interest-loan-30591 ''Is it sinful to charge interest on a loan?''] ''U.S. Catholic'', 17 March 2016. Retrieved 18 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; abolishing legal enforcement of interest-rate contracts ([[usury]]). It would not entail [[nationalization]] but could involve government involvement of some sort. Distributists look favorably on [[credit union]]s as a preferable alternative to banks.

===Anti-trust legislation===
Distributism appears to have one of its greatest influences in [[anti-trust legislation]] in America and Europe designed to break up monopolies and excessive concentration of market power in one or only a few companies, [[trust (monopoly)|trust]]s, interests, or [[cartel]]s.  Embodying the philosophy explained by Chesterton, above, that too much capitalism means too few capitalists, not too many, America's extensive system of anti-trust legislation seeks to prevent the concentration of market power in a given industry into too few hands.  Requiring that no company gain too great a share of any market is an example of how distributism has found its way into [[competition law|government policy]].  The assumption behind this legislation is the idea that having economic activity decentralized among many different industry participants is better for the economy than having one or a few large players in an industry.  (Note that anti-trust regulation does take into account cases when only large companies are viable because of the nature of an industry, as in the case of [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] like electricity distribution. It also accepts that mergers and acquisitions may improve consumer welfare; however, it generally prefers more [[agent (economics)|economic agents]] to fewer, as this generally improves [[competition (economics)|competition]].)

===Social credit===
[[Social credit]] is an interdisciplinary distributive philosophy developed by [[C. H. Douglas]] (1879–1952), a British engineer, who wrote a book by that name in 1924. It encompasses the fields of economics, political science, history, accounting, and physics. Its policies are designed, according to Douglas, to disperse economic and political power to individuals.

==Social theory==

===Human family===
Distributism sees the family of two parents and their child or children as the central and primary [[social unit]] of human ordering and the principal unit of a functioning distributist society and civilization. This unit is also the basis of a multi-generational [[extended family]], which is embedded in socially as well as genetically inter-related communities, nations, etc., and ultimately in the whole human family past, present and future. The economic system of a society should therefore be focused primarily on the flourishing of the family unit, but not in isolation: at the appropriate level of family context, as is intended in the principle of subsidiarity. Distributism reflects this doctrine most evidently by promoting the family, rather than the individual, as the basic type of owner; that is, distributism seeks to ensure that most families, rather than most individuals, will be owners of productive property. The family is, then, vitally important to the very core of distributist thought.

===Subsidiarity===
{{Main article|Subsidiarity}}
Distributism puts great emphasis on the principle of subsidiarity.  This principle holds that no larger unit (whether social, economic, or political) should perform a function which can be performed by a smaller unit.  [[Pope Pius XI]], in ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', provided the classical statement of the principle:  "Just as it is gravely wrong to take from individuals what they can accomplish by their own initiative and industry and give it to the community, so also it is an injustice and at the same time a grave evil and disturbance of right order to assign to a greater and higher association what lesser and subordinate organizations can do."&lt;ref name = "uywdmd"&gt;Pope Pius XI, ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19310515_quadragesimo-anno_en.html Quadragesimo anno]'', 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, any activity of production (which distributism holds to be the most important part of any economy) ought to be performed by the smallest possible unit.  This helps support distributism's argument that smaller units, families if possible, ought to be in control of the means of production, rather than the large units typical of modern economies.

[[Pope Pius XI]] further stated, again in ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', "every social activity ought of its very nature to furnish help to the members of the body social, and never destroy and absorb them".&lt;ref name = "uywdmd"/&gt; To prevent large private organizations from thus dominating the body politic, distributism applies this principle of subsidiarity to economic as well as to social and political action.

===Social security===
Distributism favors the elimination of [[social security]] on the basis that it further alienates man by making him more dependent on the [[The Servile State|Servile State]]. Distributists such as [[Dorothy Day]] did not favor social security when it was introduced by the United States government. This rejection of this new program was due to the direct influence of the ideas of [[Hilaire Belloc]] over American Distributists.

===Society of artisans===
Distributism promotes a society of [[artisan]]s and culture. This is influenced by an emphasis on small business, promotion of local culture, and favoring of small production over capitalistic [[mass production]]. A society of artisans promotes the distributist ideal of the unification of capital, ownership, and production rather than what distributism sees as an [[social alienation|alienation]] of man from work.

This does not, however, suggest that distributism necessarily favors a technological regression to a pre-[[Industrial Revolution]] lifestyle, but a more local ownership of factories and other industrial centers. Products such as food and clothing would be preferably returned to local producers and artisans instead of being mass-produced overseas.

==Geopolitical theory==

===Political order===
Distributism does not favor one political order over another ([[political accidentalism]]). While some distributists, such as Dorothy Day, have been [[anarchism|anarchists]], it should be remembered that most Chestertonian distributists are opposed to the mere concept of anarchism. Chesterton thought that Distributism would benefit from the discipline that theoretical analysis imposes, and that distributism is best seen as a widely encompassing concept inside of which any number of interpretations and perspectives can fit. This concept should fit in a political system broadly characterized by widespread ownership of productive property.&lt;ref&gt;G. K. Chesterton, [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/Sanity.txt ''The Outline of Sanity''](Norfolk, Va.: IHS Press, 2001), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political parties===
The Brazilian political party, [[Humanist Party of Solidarity]] is a distributist party, and distributism has influenced [[List of Christian democratic parties|Christian Democratic parties]] in Continental Europe and the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labor Party]] in Australia. [[Ross Douthat]] and [[Reihan Salam]] view their ''Grand New Party'', a roadmap for revising the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party in the United States]], as "a book written in the distributist tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ross Douthat |url=https://twitter.com/DouthatNYT/statuses/317053001070161920 |title=Twitter post |date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War===
Distributists usually use [[Just War Theory]] in determining whether a war should be fought or not. Historical positions of distributist thinkers provide insight into a distributist position on war. Both Belloc and Chesterton opposed British imperialism in general, as well as specifically opposing the [[Second Boer War]], but supported British involvement in [[World War I]].

On the other hand, prominent distributists such as Dorothy Day and those involved in the Catholic Worker Movement were/are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]], even to the point of condemning involvement in [[World War II]] at much personal cost.

==Influence==

===E. F. Schumacher===
Distributism is known to have had an influence on the economist [[E. F. Schumacher]],&lt;ref&gt;Opdebeeck, Hendrik, ed. Frontiers of Business Ethics, Volume 11 : Responsible Economics : E. F. Schumacher and His Legacy for the 21st Century. Oxford, GBR: Peter Lang AG, 2013. Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; a convert to Catholicism.

===Mondragon Corporation===
The [[Mondragon Corporation]], based in the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] in a region of Spain and France, was founded by a Catholic priest, Father [[José María Arizmendiarrieta]], who seems to have been influenced by the same Catholic social and economic teachings that inspired Belloc, Chesterton, Father [[Vincent McNabb]], and the other founders of distributism.&lt;ref&gt;Mathews, Race. ''Jobs of Our Own: Building a Stakeholder Society.'' Fernwood Publishing. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic===
Distributist ideas were put into practice by [[The Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic]], a group of artists and craftsmen who established a community in [[Ditchling]], Sussex, England, in 1920, with the motto "Men rich in virtue studying beautifulness living in peace in their houses". The Guild sought to recreate an idealised medieval lifestyle in the manner of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]]; it survived almost 70 years, until 1989.

===Big Society===

The [[Big Society]] was the flagship policy idea of the 2010 [[List of UK Conservative Party general election manifestos|UK Conservative Party general election manifesto]]. Some distributists claim that the rhetorical marketing of this policy was influenced by aphorisms of the distributist ideology and promotes distributism.&lt;ref name=DR21Jul&gt;[http://distributistreview.com/mag/2010/07/a-potential-step-in-the-right-direction/ A Potential Step in the Right Direction] 21 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It purportedly formed a part of the legislative programme of the [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement]].&lt;ref name = BBC18May&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8688860.stm Cameron and Clegg set out 'big society' policy ideas] [[BBC]] News 18-May-2010&lt;/ref&gt; The stated aim was "to create a climate that empowers local people and communities, building a big society that will 'take power away from politicians and give it to people.'"&lt;ref name=PM18May&gt;[http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/topstorynews/2010/05/big-society-50248 Government launches “Big Society” programme] [[10 Downing Street]] website 18-May-2010&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the Big Society was suggested by [[Steve Hilton]], who worked as director of strategy for David Cameron during the Coalition government before moving on to live and work in California.

An '''election surprise''' (also a '''pre-election surprise''', or, in the U.S., [[October surprise]], where elections are held on [[Election Day (United States)|the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November]]) is an event which occurs preceding an [[election]] which has enough shock value that it may be able to sway voters in close elections. When planned, an election surprise may be an act of [[propaganda]]. Election surprises typically fall into categories such as [[terrorism]], [[political scandal]]s, etc.

There may be disagreement as to what constitutes an election surprise for several reasons:
*There may be general disagreement as to whether the event in question affected, or was intended to affect the outcome of the election, especially as the event and the election may occur in different countries.
*There may be a lack of consensus as to which party the election surprise may have helped, or was intended to help.
*The relative weight of a declaration, and the ability to catch on, help to distinguish true election surprises from minor events.
*What was a surprise for some of the population may have been obvious for another part (such as the total deaths accumulated in a military activity).
*The role a [[speech act]], such as an expression of opinion/research could play. The documentary [[Hacking Democracy]] may not constitute an election surprise, whereas a statement issued by [[Osama bin Laden]] might.

Rumours of potential election surprises may also abound preceding an election.

''The term "election surprise" may also be used to denote an election with a surprising outcome.''

*October 1980, [[Iran Hostage Crisis|Iranian Embassy Hostages]].  In October, 1980, preceding [[United States presidential election, 1980|elections]] in [[United States]] on November 4, 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]]'s election campaign manager [[William Casey]], [[Laurence Silberman]] and [[George Herbert Walker Bush]] went to [[Paris]], [[France]] and held a series of meetings with Iranian officials from October 15 to October 20, 1980 to discuss the fate of the 52 remaining hostages taken from the US [[embassy]] building in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]] on November 4, 1979.  Iranian officials agreed not to release the hostages prior to [[Election Day (politics)|election day]] on November 4, 1980 in exchange for a shipment of [[F-4 Phantom II]] aircraft tires and spare parts supplied to [[Iran]] from [[Israel]] between October 21 and October 23, 1980 in contravention of the [[United States]]' [[boycott]] and the [[Trading with the Enemy Act]].  The 52 hostages were finally released after 444 days in captivity on the same day, at the same hour, that [[Ronald Reagan]] was sworn into office on January 20, 1981.  The [[United States Congress]] eventually held hearings in 1991 led by [[Lee H. Hamilton]] on the matter, which were underreported in the media and widely considered to be a [[whitewash]], and in which "no credible evidence" was found "linking Reagan's team to the delay of the hostages' release".&lt;ref&gt;Gary Sick. 1991. October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan. New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 1976 drunk driving citation on candidate [[George W. Bush]] was considered an election surprise for its suspicious timing, coming out one week before the 2000 US Presidential Election.
*[[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings|Madrid train bombings]] on 11 March 2004, preceding [[Spanish legislative election, 2004|elections]] in [[Spain]] on 14 March 2004. This led to the defeat of the sitting government subsequently leading to the Spanish withdraw from Iraq.
* The [[Killian documents]], A faked set of papers provided to CBS News prior to the 2004 US Presidential Election were also considered an election surprise for the timing and negative propaganda value.
*Rep. [[Mark Foley]] (R-FL) admitted to sending explicit instant messages to underage pages on 29 September 2006, preceding [[United States general elections, 2006|mid-term elections]] in the [[United States]] on 7 November 2006. Democrats said that high-ranking members of the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican Party]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] may have known about the events.
*[[Saddam Hussein]] was [[Trial of Saddam Hussein|found guilty]] of crimes against humanity on 5 November 2006, preceding [[United States general elections, 2006|mid-term elections]] in the [[United States]] on 7 November 2006.

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}
'''''Encyclopedia of Hinduism''''', 1st ed., 2012, is a comprehensive, multi-volume, English language encyclopedia of [[Hinduism]], comprising ''{{IAST|Sanātana Dharma}}'', a [[Sanskrit]] phrase, meaning "the eternal [[dharma|law]]", or the "eternal way", that is used to refer to Hinduism, [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Reviews/Hinduism-is-an-intellectual-system-not-religion/Article1-899317.aspx|title=Hinduism is an intellectual system, not religion|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423060143/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Reviews/Hinduism-is-an-intellectual-system-not-religion/Article1-899317.aspx|archivedate=23 April 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a 7,184 page, 11-volume publication with full-color illustrations of temples, places, thinkers, rituals and festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rupapublications.com/client/Book/Encyclopedia-of-Hinduism.aspx|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism Ed. Dr. Kapil Kapoor|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Rupa &amp; Co.]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' is an inspiration and dream project of Swami [[Chidanand Saraswati]], President of [[Parmarth Niketan]] and India Heritage Research Foundation. Under preparation for 25 years, it has been edited by Dr. [[Kapil Kapoor]] with contribution from over 2000 scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The Sunday Tribune - Books | url =http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120219/spectrum/book1.htm | accessdate = 5 March 2013| publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclopaedia provides conceptual perspective and a general understanding of the different facets of Hinduism. It does not confine itself to religion alone, and has in it entries on art, history, language, literature, philosophy, polity, sciences, and women's studies. The editorial introduction records:

:"This encyclopaedia has been prepared to give a fairly comprehensive idea of an ancient way of life, a culture that has roots going back thousands of years and has been called ‘Hinduism’ in the last two hundred years of English discourse. It is a book of knowledge about facts, theories, systems, practices, institutions, beliefs, texts, thinkers and values of, what in fact is, a continuity of one of the two living knowledge cultures of the world, the Vedic (Semitic being the other). Hindu society has been a ‘knowledge society’  in its proper sense for at least 5000 years: the word ‘Veda’ itself means ‘knowledge'."

On 3–4 April 2010, a preview and blessings ceremony for the ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' was held at Parmarth Niketan, attended by [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]], M.M. Swami Gurusharananand, Swami Avdheshanand Giri, [[Ramesh Oza|Sant Shri Rameshbhai Oza]], [[Ramdev|Swami Ramdev]], [[Morari Bapu|Sant Shri Morari Bapu]] and other religious leaders as well as top political leaders, including [[L. K. Advani|Shri L.K. Advani]] and then-Chief Minister of Uttarakhand [[Ramesh Pokhriyal|Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank]], and IHRF board members and trustees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parmarth.com/updates/april2010.pdf April 2010 Special Newsletter] Parmarth Niketan&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Edition of the ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' was launched at the University of South Carolina on 26 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sc.edu/news/newsarticle.php?nid=6353#.VA7HJ2O6-Yg "USC to launch ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' Aug. 26"] University of South Carolina News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/hindi/multimedia/2013/08/130827_encyclopedia_hinduism_gal_sb.shtml 25 बरसों में संजोया हिन्दू धर्म का विश्वकोश] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigstory.ap.org/article/25-years-making-hindu-encyclopedia-complete 25 Years in Making, Hindu Encyclopedia Complete] Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' was presented to the President of India [[Pranab Mukherjee|Shri Pranab Mukherjee]] on 23 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=0 President of India receives a copy of ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism''] Press Information Bureau, Government of India, President's Secretariat, Press Release 23-06-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inception ==
The idea was conceived by Swami [[Chidanand Saraswati]], president of [[Parmarth Niketan]] Ashram, at a Hindu-Jain Temple in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1987. Subsequently, in November of the same year, the India Heritage Research Foundation was formed to execute the idea of preparing an authoritative, comprehensive and up-to-date ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =A Landmark Publication - Shri L. K. Advani | url =http://blog.lkadvani.in/blog-in-english/a-landmark-publication | accessdate = 5 March 2013| publisher=[[L. K. Advani]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. K. L. Seshagiri Rao, Professor Emeritus in Religious Studies at University of Virginia was appointed the Chief Editor.

== Development == 
Over the next five years, Swami Chidanand Saraswati and Dr. K. L. Seshagiri Rao assembled an international team of scholars. In 1998, [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], Prime Minister of India at the time, spoke effusively in praise of the project:

:"Your undertaking is rightly called the 'Project of the Third Millennium.’ This is a monumental undertaking.  It is indeed a [[Jnana]] [[Yajna]].  Hence, all those who have offered their time, talent and scholarship as ahuti for the success of this [[Yajna]] deserve our heartiest applause and felicitations."

In early 2006, Dr. [[Kapil Kapoor]], Professor of English and Concurrent Professor of Sanskrit Studies who had retired as rector for [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]], Delhi the previous year, was appointed chief editor of the project.

== Foreword ==
The first volume of the encyclopedia contains a 44-page foreword by Dr. [[Karan Singh]]. In the opening paragraph, he writes:

:"Hinduism calls itself the Sanatana Dharma, the eternal faith, because it is based not upon the teachings of a single preceptor but on the collective wisdom and inspiration of great seers and sages from the very dawn of Indian civilization."

The closing comments of Dr. Singh's forward begin with the following note:

:"The long awaited publication of a massive eleven-volume ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' is a major publishing event. Many years of scholarship, organization and devotion have gone into the preparation of what will be a landmark in the history of Hindu research."

== Reviews == 
Indrajit Hazra, writing for ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', said its "entries are crisp, provide background and foreground, and come with a bibliography." The review goes on to add:

:"The production is excellent, as is the quality of images that are scattered across the volumes. With entries that include the ''Dhammapada'' (the main text of Theravada Buddhism), the 'Chipko movement' (the organised environmental movement to resist the destruction of forests in India'), as well as the 'Saura Mandala' (solar system), clearly, this is an encyclopedia that doesn't define 'Hinduism' in any narrow, proselytising way."

Hazra concludes his review by calling the encyclopedia "a startlingly good treasure trunk for anyone interested in the history of ideas to dip into." Former Home Minister of India [[L.K. Advani]] called the work "a landmark publication."

The '''fundamental plane''' in a [[spherical coordinate system]] is a [[plane of reference]] that divides the [[sphere]] into two [[Sphere|hemisphere]]s. The [[latitude]] of a [[point (geometry)|point]] is then the [[angle]] between the fundamental plane and the line joining the point to the centre of the sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=It's ONLY Rocket Science: An Introduction in Plain English|first=Lucy|last=Rogers|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=9780387753782|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JTFGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a [[geographic coordinate system]] of the Earth, the fundamental plane is the [[Equator]]. [[Celestial coordinate system]]s have varying fundamental planes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Compendium of Spherical Astronomy with Its Applications to the Determination and Reduction of Positions of the Fixed Stars |first=Simon |last=Newcomb |publisher=Macmillan |year=1906 |page=92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CAxDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA92}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[horizontal coordinate system]] uses the observer's [[horizon]].
* The Besselian coordinate system uses Earth's [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (day/night boundary). This is a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] (''x'', ''y'', ''z'').

'''Gender roles in non-heterosexual communities''' are a topic of much debate; some people believe traditional, heterosexual [[gender roles]] are often erroneously enforced on [[non-heterosexual]] relationships by means of [[heteronormative]] culture and attitudes towards these non-conformative relationships.&lt;ref name=ThoughtCat1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jaroniec|first1=Mila|title=5 Common Misconceptions About Lesbians|url=http://thoughtcatalog.com/mila-jaroniec/2012/05/5-common-misconceptions-about-lesbians/|website=thoughtcatalog.com|publisher=Thought Catalog|accessdate=23 March 2015|date=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:A Morning Frolic, or the Transmutation of the Sexes.jpg|thumb|237px|left|Satire on cross-dressing, around 1780 Britain]] Gender roles in non-heterosexual communities have been the subject of debate in Western society. Peter M. Nardi of Pitzer College says: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The connection between sexual orientation and gender roles has been confused by many people. Too often, assumptions about homosexuality or heterosexuality have led to assumptions about masculinity or femininity&amp;nbsp;... Understanding the differences between sexual identity and gender roles is enhanced when focusing on the issues of friendship and sex among gay men. For many people, being gay has been interpreted in terms of not being masculine or, more specifically, being seen as feminine.{{sfn|Nardi|1992|p=173}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to human rights campaigner [[Peter Tatchell]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Queers subvert the gender system. Gay men love males and are not adequately [[macho]] and aggressive. Lesbians love women and are insufficiently passive and dependent on men. That's why we're persecuted. Our nonconformity threatens the system which sustains the social hegemony of male heterosexuality and [[misogyny]].&lt;ref name=Tatchell1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tatchell|first1=Peter|title=The "gender fuck" politics of the London Gay Liberation Front 1970–73.|url=http://www.petertatchell.net/masculinity/subverting_the_gender.htm|website=petertatchell.net|publisher=Unpublished|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has been described as "gender fuck politics".&lt;ref name=Tatchell1/&gt;

[[Havelock Ellis]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] thought homosexuality resulted from reversed gender roles. Most modern scientists accept there is no strong evidence that a homosexual or bisexual orientation must be associated with atypical gender roles. Many factors have been linked to homosexuality, including genetic factors, anatomical factors, birth order, and hormones in the prenatal environment.&lt;ref name="King, B. 2009"&gt;King, B. (2009).

The application of the traditional "man" and traditional "woman" in lesbian relationships is common, as with gay male relationships. Most often in lesbian relationships, there will come a point when someone asks the question: "So which one's the guy?", even if no males are involved in the relationship. This is believed to stem from heteronormative and patriarchal setups of traditional heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name=ThoughtCat1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karlan|first1=Sarah|title=12 Ways Lesbians Can Respond To: "Who's The Man In The Relationship?"|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/skarlan/12-ways-lesbians-can-respond-to-whos-the-man-in-the-relation#.py1Oyv30vM|accessdate=4 October 2015|work=BuzzFeed|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Joseph Pleck says the hierarchy of masculinities among men exist largely in a dichotomy of homosexual and heterosexual males, and says, "our society uses the male heterosexual-homosexual dichotomy as a central symbol for all the rankings of masculinity, for the division on any grounds between males who are 'real men' and have power, and males who are not".&lt;ref name=nomas.org&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pleck|first1=Joseph|title=Understanding Patriarchy and Men's Power|url=http://www.nomas.org/node/176|website=nomas.org|publisher= National Organization for Men Against Sexism (Nomas)|accessdate=21 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301004232/http://www.nomas.org/node/176|archivedate=1 March 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Kimmel]]&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S., and Summer Lewis.

Pleck says that to avoid the continuation of male oppression of women and themselves and other men, patriarchal structures, institutions, and discourse must be eliminated from North American society.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Gay men are considered by some to "deviate from the masculine norm", and are benevolently stereotyped as "gentle and refined" (even among other gay men), and pertain a specific mode of masculinity for themselves, according to human rights activists such as [[Peter Tatchell]], which each make their contributions to society.&lt;ref name=Tatchell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tatchell|first1=Peter|title=What Straight men Could Learn From Gay Men – A Queer Kind of Masculinity?|publisher=Woman's Journal|accessdate=|date=January 1999|quote=Contrary to the well-intentioned claim that gays are "just the same" as straights, there is a difference. What is more, the distinctive style of gay masculinity is of great social benefit. Wouldn't life be dull without the flair and imagination of queer fashion designers and interior decorators?

In a documentary called ''The Butch Factor'', a number of gay men—one of them [[transgender]]—were asked about their views on masculinity. The consensus was that showing masculine traits was an advantage, both in and out [[closeted|the closet]]. For the "butch" gay men, this allowed them to conceal their sexual orientation for longer when doing masculine activities such as playing sports, as effeminacy is often incorrectly associated with homosexuality—&lt;ref name=nacua&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacua.org/nacuanet/visual/nacuanotessample.html |title=Gender Identity and Expression Issues at Colleges and Universities |date=2 June 2005 |accessdate=2 April 2007 |work=[[National Association of College and University Attorneys]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chrysler&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid28980.asp |title=Chrysler TV ad criticized for using gay stereotypes |accessdate=7 April 2007 |date=7 April 2006 |work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423032540/http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid28980.asp |archivedate=23 April 2006 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; so much so that they doubted their own sexual orientation; because they did not see themselves as effeminate, they did not feel they were gay.

A study conducted by researchers from the Center for Theoretical Study at Charles University in Prague and The Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic found there are significant differences in the shape of faces of heterosexual and gay men; gay men have masculine features, which they say "undermined stereotypical notions of gay men as more feminine looking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saul|first1=Heather|title=Gay and straight men may have different facial shapes, new study suggests|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/gay-and-straight-men-may-have-different-facial-shapes-new-study-suggests-8928519.html|accessdate=6 March 2015|work=The Independent|date=8 November 2013|quote=Their results found that homosexual men were rated as more stereotypically 'masculine' than heterosexual men, which they said undermined stereotypical notions of gay men as more feminine looking.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrow, and Robert W. Deisher. [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/87/6/869.short "Risk factors for attempted suicide in gay and bisexual youth."] ''Pediatrics'' 87.6 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Many cultures, such as the [[kathoey]] in Thailand, have their own categorisations of sexual orientation and identity, and gender identity that are difficult to categorise using the Western labels gay and transgender.{{sfn|Duthel|2013|p=9}}

In the United States, boys are often [[homosocial]],{{sfn|Gagnon|1977}} and gender role performance determines social rank.&lt;ref&gt;David and Brannon, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; While homosexual boys receive the same [[enculturation]], they are less compliant. Martin Levine says: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Harry (1982, 51–52), for example, found that 42 percent of his gay respondents were 'sissies' during childhood. Only 11 percent of his heterosexual samples were gender role nonconformists. Bell, Weinberg, and Hammersmith (1981, 188) reported that half of their man homosexual subjects practiced gender-inappropriate behaviour in childhood. Among their heterosexual men, the rate of noncompliance was 25 percent.  Saghir and Robins (1973, 18) found that one-third of their gay man respondents conformed to gender role dictates. Only 3 percent of their heterosexual men deviated from the norm.{{sfn|Levine|1998}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Thus, effeminate boys, or ''sissies'', are physically and verbally harassed, causing them to feel worthless and to "de-feminise" themselves.{{sfn|Harry|1982}}&lt;ref&gt;Saghir and Robins 1973, 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;5–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Stonewall riots]], changes in stereotypical gender role performance were observed among certain segments of the gay male population:&lt;ref&gt;Karlen, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Cory and LeRoy, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stearn:
&lt;blockquote&gt;They have a different face for different occasions. In conversations with each other, they often undergo a subtle change. I have seen men who appeared to be normal suddenly smile roguishly, soften their voices, and simper as they greeted homosexual friends&amp;nbsp;... Many times I saw these changes occur after I had gained a homosexual's confidence and he could safely risk my disapproval. Once as I watched a luncheon companion become an effeminate caricature of himself, he apologised, [saying] "It is hard to always remember that one is a man."&lt;ref&gt;Stearn 1962, 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{quote box|align=right|width=25%|quote=There is a definite prejudice towards men who use femininity as part of their palate; their emotional palate, their physical palate. Is that changing? It's changing in ways that don't advance the cause of femininity. I'm not talking frilly-laced pink things or Hello Kitty stuff. I'm talking about goddess energy, intuition and feelings. That is still under attack, and it has gotten worse.

Pre-Stonewall "closet" culture accepted homosexuality as effeminate behaviour, and thus emphasised camp, [[drag (clothing)|drag]], and [[swish (slang)|swish]] behaviour, including an interest in fashion and decorating. Masculine gay men were marginalised and formed their own communities, such as the [[leather subculture]] and [[Bear (gay culture)|bear subculture]], and wore clothes such as sailor uniforms that were commonly associated with working-class people.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–23, 56&lt;/ref&gt; Post-Stonewall, "[[Castro clone|clone culture]]" became dominant and effeminacy is now marginalised. This is evident in a definite preference shown in personal ads for masculine-behaving men.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey et al. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheila Jeffreys]] termed this the ''butch shift'' of the 1970s, described it as having been inspired by the success of the [[gay liberation]] movement, and saw it as being exemplified in the [[Village People]] dance music group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jeffreys |first=Sheila |date=2005 |title=Beauty and Misogyny: Harmful Cultural Practices in the West |publisher=Routledge |page= |isbn=0-415-35183-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The avoidance of effeminacy by men, including gay ones, has been linked to possible impedance of personal and public health. Regarding [[HIV/AIDS]], masculine behaviour was stereotyped as being unconcerned about safe sex practices while engaging in promiscuous sexual behaviour. Early reports from New York City indicated more women had been tested for HIV/AIDS at their own behest than men.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;148&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Halperin]] compares "universalising" and "minoritising" notions of gender deviance. He says, "'Softness' either may represent the specter of potential gender failure that haunts all normative masculinity, an ever-present threat to the masculinity of every man, or it may represent the disfiguring peculiarity of a small class of deviant individuals."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Halperin]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The term "effeminaphobia" was coined to describe strong anti-effeminacy. In 1995, [[J. Michael Bailey]] coined the similar term, "femiphobia", to describe the ambivalence gay men and culture have about effeminate behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bailey, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Gay author Tim Bergling also coined the term "sissyphobia" in his work ''[[Sissyphobia: Gay Men and Effeminate Behavior]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Vox, [http://www.edgeboston.com/index.php?ch=entertainment&amp;id=53855 "Would Life Be Better if You Were Straight?"], Gaywired.com, 20 December 2007, also appeared in ''Edge'', Boston&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timbergling.com/sissyphobia/ Bergling, Tim.

{{Main|Top, bottom and versatile}}

In [[gay slang]], ''to top'' means to have anal sex in an insertive capacity (penetrating with one's penis); ''to bottom'' means to have anal sex in a receptive capacity (being penetrated). When the terms are used as designations of self-identity, ''a top'' may be a man who has a clear preference for topping, and ''a bottom'' may be a man who has a clear preference for bottoming; ''versatile'' refers to a man who enjoys both and has no clear preference.&lt;ref name="Underwood"&gt;{{cite book | author =Steven Gregory Underwood|title =Gay men and anal eroticism: tops, bottoms, and versatiles|isbn = 1-56023-375-3|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|pages=225 pages|accessdate=2011-12-02|url=https://books.google.com/?id=i4wRl0_8NuUC&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that most gay men are in this sense ''versatiles''.&lt;ref&gt;Saghir, M.

There is considerable debate as to whether childhood gender stereotypes are inborn or are influenced by environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Curtis|first1=Polly|title=Pink v blue – are children born with gender preferences?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/dec/13/women-children|accessdate=21 May 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of homosexual or heterosexual relationships in families influences play patterns in children: children of same-sex couples are raised differently, resulting in gender roles different from those of opposite-sex parents, according to the gender binary.

There has also been much research into [[childhood gender nonconformity]] and sexual orientation. Gay men often report having been feminine boys and lesbian women often report having been masculine girls.

===Division of labour===
{{see also|Division_of_labour#Gendered_division_of_labour{{!}}Gendered division of labour|Women's work}}

Maura Kelly and Elizabeth Hauck conducted research on the division of labour within same-sex relationships through interviewing a sample of same-sex couples (2015).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt; Maura Kelly &amp; Elizabeth Hauck (2015). [http://www.tandfonline.com.ezproxyd.bham.ac.uk/doi/abs/10.1080/1550428X.2015.1006750 "Doing Housework, Redoing Gender: Queer Couples Negotiate the Household Division of Labor"]. ''Journal of GLBT Family Studies'', 11:5, pp. 438-464, DOI: 10.1080/1550428X.2015.1006750&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly and Hauck’s study found that labour in same-sex couples is divided on the basis of time availability and personal preference.These factors are more influential in the division of labour than the belief that the labour should be divided evenly between the partners in same-sex couples.

Kelly and Hauck's research found that divisions of labour within a same-sex relationship cannot be viewed as setting a precedent as to what gender roles are normal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A female partner in a same-sex relationship may perform chores that are considered feminine, like cooking, cleaning, and child-rearing. However, the other female partner may perform chores that are considered masculine, like outside work and employment outside of the home. The partners’ behaviours do not support gender roles because all the roles performed are done by women. There is not an inherent distinction made between masculine and feminine because women are performing both types of chores. This lack of gender role discrimination would be true in same-sex relationships between two men as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Feminism ==
{{Feminism sidebar |concepts}}
{{See also|Feminist views on sexual orientation}}
One large myth about lesbians is that they are all [[feminists]]. While this is not true,&lt;ref name=ThoughtCat1 /&gt; there is a specific branch of feminism called "[[lesbian feminism]]", a cultural movement in the [[Western world]], most influential in the 1970s–1980s, that advocates lesbianism as the logical result of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrienne Rich|Rich, A]]. (1980). ''[[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]]''. Signs, 5, 631–660.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanessa Thorpe says in ''[[The Observer]]'', "...&amp;nbsp;key members of the Votes For Women movement led a promiscuous lesbian lifestyle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Thorpe, Vanessa|author2=Marsh, Alec|title=Diary reveals lesbian love trysts of suffragette leaders|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/11/vanessathorpe.theobserver|accessdate=5 April 2015|agency=The Guardian|work=The Observer|date=11 June 2000|quote=Entries in the diary of a suffragette have revealed that key members of the Votes For Women movement led a promiscuous lesbian lifestyle.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[women's suffrage]] movement is generally considered a feminist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Cochrane, Kira|title=Nine inspiring lessons the suffragettes can teach feminists today|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/29/nine-lessons-suffragettes-feminists|accessdate=5 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesbian feminism typically situates the state of being a lesbian as a form of resistance to patriarchal institutions. Sexual orientation is posited here as a choice, or at least a conscious response to a situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/wlm/furies/ "Lesbians in Revolt: Male Supremacy Quakes and Quivers", ''The Furies: Lesbian/Feminist Monthly''] Vol. 1, January 1972. Accessed 2 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also seen as a critique of male supremacy, chauvinism, and masculinity in general.&lt;ref name="Jeffreys, Sheila p. 19"&gt;Jeffreys, Sheila: "Unpacking Queer Politics," p. 19. Polity, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lesbian separatism]] is a form of [[separatist feminism]] specific to lesbians. In separatist feminism, lesbianism is posited as a key feminist strategy that enables women to invest their energies in other women, creating new space and dialogue about women's relationships, and typically limits their dealings with men.&lt;ref&gt;Revolutionary Lesbians: "How to Stop Choking to Death Or: Separatism," 1971, in, "For Lesbians Only: A Separatist Anthology," ed. Hoagland, Sarah Lucia, and Julia Penelope. pp. 22–24. Onlywomen Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave pro-feminism]] paid increased attention to issues of sexuality, particularly the relationship between homosexual men and [[hegemonic masculinity]]. This shift led to more cooperation between the [[men's liberation]] and [[gay liberation]] movements. In part, this cooperation arose because masculinity was understood to be a social construction, and as a response to the [[wikt:universalization|universalization]] of "men" seen in previous men's movements. In 2010, Elizabeth Wilson wrote that the [[Gay Liberation Front]] and feminism worked alongside one another to "spark a way of thinking about human relations in society that has led to significant change"; Peter Tatchell wrote about the GLF's "idealistic vision [that] involved creating a new sexual democracy, without homophobia, misogyny, racism and class privilege".{{sfn|Gay Liberation Front|1971|pages=preface}}

The conference has been held in several European universities and institutions, including UCL, Oxford, Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Humboldt Institute in Berlin, and Sussex.

The conference deals with what the organisers describe as "geek law", studying the intersection of law, regulation, popular culture and technology. The covered topics include [[artificial intelligence]], [[cryptocurrencies]], [[virtual world]]s, games, [[tattoo]]s, [[3D printing]], [[fan fiction]], [[digital privacy]], [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] rights, [[augmented reality]], and robots.

The Call for Papers of the first workshop gave the following explanation:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gikii.org/previous-events/2006-edinburgh/ 2006 –Edinburgh], GikII archive&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Geek]]s are the people who contribute to this knowledge: fellow travellers on the digital omnibus, who delight in finding, publishing, inventing and sharing nuggets of joyful knowledge and innovation from the worlds of technology, science, popular culture, and technotrivia. LIIs are [[Legal Information Institute]]s: invaluable on-line temples of legal knowledge. The patriarch of the field is [[AustLII]], but the concept has spread through the world bringing us [[BAILII]], [[PacLII]], [[CommonLII]], and no doubt, many more bad puns to come.

GikII proposes to be the place where these worlds, institutions and players will come together for the first time at a major law and technology conference.

[[Alemanni]]c grave fields date to the 5th to 8th century. Before the middle of the 5th century, grave fields are small, often including less than five graves, probably corresponding to a single homestead or family. The sparsity of graves in the early period may suggest partial [[cremation]]. In the mid- to late 5th century, burial customs appear to change, with the introduction of larger row-grave fields.

Grave fields are often arranged on elevated ground outside settlements. The arrangement of graves is often east to west &amp;mdash; the head of the body placed on the western end, looking east.&lt;ref name="Gerhard Fingerlin:"&gt;Gerhard Fingerlin: ''Zur alamannischen Siedlungsgeschichte des 3.-7.

Until the beginning of the 6th century, these row graves are accompanied by more prestigious single graves including precious [[grave good]]s. Quast (1997) assumes that the 5th-century change in burial practice was due to a renewed influx of [[Elbe Germanic]] settlers ([[Danube Swabians]] displaced by [[Goths|Gothic]] migration).

Male graves often include weapons &amp;mdash; in the mid-5th century typically a [[Francisca]] axe, besides [[Migration Period sword|spathas]] and [[seax]]es. Female graves often include jewellery, such as bracelets, ear-rings and [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]].

[[Image:Biigabe Kette.jpg|thumb|300px|6th- to 7th-century jewellery found in the [[Freiburg (region)|Freiburg district]].]]

Large Alemannic row grave fields have been excavated at [[Lauchheim]], [[Gammertingen]], [[Weingarten (Württemberg)|Weingarten]], [[Ravensburg]], all in [[Swabia]], the one in Ravensburg including over 1,000 graves dating to between 450 and 710. The field in [[Sasbach (Ortenau)|Sasbach]] includes over 2,000 graves. [[Mengen, Germany|Mengen]] has over 1,000 graves.

Alemannic graves appear south of the Rhine, in the [[Swiss Plateau]], from the 6th century. Alemannic colonization of the Swiss plateau apparently took place from the [[Basel]] area, since the number of graves there declines simultaneously. Significant influx of Alemannic settlers to the Swiss plateau begins only in the 7th century. Grave fields from this period include one at [[Elgg]]-Ettenbühl near [[Winterthur]]; with 340 graves it is the largest field south of the [[High Rhine]].

[[Germanic Christianity|Christianization]] of the Alemanni during the 7th century brings about the end of the grave field traditions. The dead from this period were buried in [[graveyard]]s near churches. Prestigious graves of local nobility appears to have resisted the Christianization of burial customs into the 8th century, possibly until the 786 decree of [[Charlemagne]] outlawing pagan burial.

'''Gustavus Adolphus College''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|ə|s|ˈ|t|eɪ|v|ə|s}} {{respell|gəs|TAY|vəs}}) is a [[Private university|private]], [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]] [[liberal arts college]] in [[St. Peter, Minnesota|St. Peter]], [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/gustavus-adolphus-college|title=Economic diversity and student outcomes at Gustavus Adolphus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A four-year, residential institution, Gustavus Adolphus College was founded in 1862 by Swedish Americans and is affiliated with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]. The college retains its Swedish and Lutheran heritage. The premier event on campus is the annual [[Nobel Conference]], which features [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureates]] and other scholars explaining their expertise to a general audience. In 2015, Gustavus Adolphus College ranked as the 64th best liberal arts college in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/local/us-news-college-ranking-trends-2014/1292/|title=U.S. News college ranking trends 2014|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Founding===
[[File:View of Gustavus Adolphus College, St. Peter, MN.jpg|thumb|right|View of the campus c. 1905]]
[[File:Rev.EricNorelius.jpg|alt=The Rev. Eric Norelius|thumb|"Whatever we do, let us do it well."- The Rev. Eric Norelius |250x250px]]
The predecessor to the college was founded in 1862 as a [[Lutheran]] [[parochial school]] in [[Red Wing, Minnesota|Red Wing]] by [[Eric Norelius]]. The school offered classes for grade-school children; collegiate courses were not offered until nearly a decade later, but the college uses the earlier date as the year it was founded.&lt;ref name="gustavus-v-12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gustavus.edu/welcome/campushistory.pdf |title=Songs of Thy Triumph – A Short History of Gustavus Adolphus College |publisher=[[St. Peter, Minnesota]]: Gustavus Adolphus College |last=Waldhauser |first=Steve |accessdate=September 26, 2011 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally named Minnesota Elementarskola (''[[elementary school]]'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]), it moved the following year to East Union, an unincorporated town in [[Dahlgren Township, Carver County, Minnesota|Dahlgren Township]]. In 1865, on the 1,000th anniversary of the death of [[St. Ansgar]], known as the "[[wikt:apostle|Apostle]] of the North", the institution was renamed and incorporated as St. Ansgar's Academy.&lt;ref name="gustavus-v-12"/&gt;

===Renaming===
In April 1873, the college was to be renamed Gustavus Adolphus Literary &amp; Theological Institute in honor of King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] once the final location and buildings were secured. A delegation of residents from [[St. Peter, Minnesota|St. Peter]] won favor from the founders to relocate there as a result of an economic crisis and the town's offer of $10,000 and donation of acreage for a larger campus. Courses were initially to start in the fall of 1875 but slow progress on the construction of the first campus building, Old Main, delayed the opening. On October 16, 1876, Gustavus Adolphus College opened at the location that still stands today. It is the oldest of several Lutheran colleges founded in Minnesota. It was founded as a college of the [[Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church]]. In 1962 it became affiliated with the [[Lutheran Church in America]], when the Augustana Synod merged into that body. The Lutheran Church in America merged in 1988 to create the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]].

===World War II===
During World War II, Gustavus Adolphus College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name="gustavus-v-12"/&gt;

===Founding of the Nobel Conference===
The annual [[Nobel Conference]] was established in the mid-1960s when college officials asked the [[Nobel Foundation]] for permission to name the new science building the Alfred Nobel Hall of Science as a memorial to the Swedish inventor [[Alfred Nobel]]. Permission was granted, and the facility's dedication ceremony in 1963 included officials from the Nobel Foundation and 26 [[Nobel Laureates]]. Following the 1963 Nobel Prize ceremonies in Stockholm, college representatives met with Nobel Foundation officials, asking them to endorse an annual science conference at the College and to allow use of the Nobel name to establish credibility and high standards. At the urging of several prominent Nobel laureates, the foundation granted the request, and the first conference was held at the college in January 1965.

== Academics ==
=== Curriculum ===
Students choose from over 70 programs of study with 75 majors in 25 academic departments and three interdisciplinary programs (including 17 honors majors), ranging from [[physics]] to [[religion]] to [[Scandinavian studies]]. Gustavus has been among the top 10 liberal-arts institutions nationally as the baccalaureate origin of physics PhDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/webcaspar/|title=ncsesdata.nsf.gov – WebCASPAR{{!}}Home – US National Science Foundation (NSF)|website=ncsesdata.nsf.gov|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college has 170 faculty, of whom 94% are tenure-track{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}. The student-to-faculty ratio is 11:1, creating an average class size of approximately 15. The College's Writing Across the Curriculum program fosters writing skills in all academic disciplines. Since 1983, the college has had a chapter of the academic honor society [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]].

The school offers an alternative interdisciplinary general education program known as the Three Crowns Curriculum. Recently the college instituted a test-optional admission policy, making it the first private college in Minnesota to forgo the ACT/SAT score requirement on its application.

==Campus==
[[File:Nicollet by Paul Granlund.jpg|thumb|''Nicollet'' is a sculpture by Paul Granlund at Gustavus Adolphus College]]
The college's first building in St. Peter, affectionately known as '''Old Main''', originally housed the entire college. The campus, known as '''The Hill''', comprises 340 landscaped acres and features science facilities, computer and language labs, and a large dining facility. The campus includes 33 sculptures by the late Minnesota sculptor [[Paul Granlund]], an alumnus of the college who for many years was sculptor-in-residence.

Every tree indigenous to Minnesota is grown in the college's [[Linnaeus Arboretum]]. In 2009 students founded Big Hill Farm, which grows produce for the cafeteria and aims to connect the campus to sustainable agriculture. In the fall of 2011, a new social science center, Beck Hall, opened on campus.

====Old Main====
"Old Main" was the first building erected at Gustavus Adolphus College. Its cornerstone was laid on August 12, 1875.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"The Dedication of 'Old Main': the fiftieth anniversary." Gustavus Adolphus College, 1926. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Contracted to O. N. Ostrom and constructed from [[Kasota limestone]], the total cost of the building was estimated at $25,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Old Main was completed in 1876 and dedicated on October 31 of that year. Originally called the School Building, as more buildings were erected it became known as the Main Building and by 1905 as Old Main.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The building was heated by wood stoves and housed the entire college in the institution's first years. It originally contained several classrooms and sleeping quarters for students, faculty, and the president as well as a kitchen, dining room, chapel, library, and museum.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;"Dedication Ceremony: on the occasion of the renovation of the Old Main building." Gustavus Adolphus College, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1920, it was tradition for seniors to gather on the building's roof for a sunrise breakfast the morning of commencement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On its 50th anniversary in 1926, Old Main underwent a renovation from funds provided by the [[Minnesota Conference]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[1998 Comfrey–St. Peter tornado outbreak|1998 tornado]], which destroyed much of the Gustavus campus, damaged Old Main's bell tower. In 2005 another renovation was completed; the building now houses the Office of the Chaplains and the religion, political science, philosophy, and classics departments.

A popular ghost story surrounding Old Main is the tale told by former Chaplain Richard Elvee of two deceased Gustavus security officers, Harley and Barney, occasionally wandering its halls while he composed his sermons on Sunday mornings.&lt;ref&gt;Freiert, William K. "Old Main Rededication Remarks." Rededication of Old Main. Oct. 8, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christ Chapel====
Christ Chapel is a church in the center of Gustavus Adolphus College. Constructed from March 2, 1959, to fall 1961, the chapel was dedicated on January 7, 1962. Its construction was made possible by gifts from the congregations of the Lutheran [[Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church|Augustana Synod]], a predecessor body of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], which is affiliated with the college. [[Ecumenism|Ecumenical]] services are held each weekday and on Sundays during the academic year. There is seating for 1,500 people in the chapel, 1,200 on the main floor and 300 in the balcony. It is the largest seating area on campus.

The chapel and surrounding grounds are adorned by the sculptures of [[Paul Granlund|Paul T. Granlund]], the former artist-in-residence at Gustavus Adolphus College.

Christ Chapel's organ was originally built by Hillgreen-Lane when the Chapel was built. It has been significantly altered in the last 30 years. These renovations, carried out by David Engen and more recently by the Hendrickson Organ Company of St. Peter, include a new console with solid state combination and relay, moving several ranks of pipes from an antiphonal position in the basement into the main organ above the balcony, restructuring the Swell mixture, and extensive repairs after the 1998 tornado. It has 55 speaking ranks of pipes, played from a four-manual console, and a preparation on the new Great chest for a mounted Kornet V stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gustavus.edu/chaplain/christchapel.php|title=Christ Chapel|publisher=Gustavus Adolphus College}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chapel also houses a small portative organ of three stops on one manual that is used for accompanying and especially for continuo playing in Baroque compositions.

On March 29, 1998, the chapel's spire was toppled by the [[1998 Comfrey – St. Peter tornado outbreak|tornado]] that left most of [[St. Peter, Minnesota]] in ruins. On March 17, 2008, the cross that had been atop the spire was hung from the chapel's ceiling during a service marking the 10-year anniversary of the tornado.

=== Disasters ===
* On January 8, 1970, the Auditorium was completely gutted by a fire, after which it was not rebuilt.
* On March 29, 1998, the College's [[campus]] was hit by a mile-wide [[1998 Comfrey – St. Peter tornado outbreak|F3 tornado]] that broke 80 percent of the windows, leveled nearly 2,000 trees, toppled the [[chapel|chapel's]] [[spire]], and caused more than $50 million in damages. This is considered one of the most expensive college disasters in history. There was only one death (not a Gustavus Adolphus College student) despite the tornado's widespread path, most likely because most students were away on spring break at the time. Hundreds of volunteers worked to get the campus back into a condition where the students could return after a three-week hiatus. Still, some classes were held in FEMA trailers as some campus buildings were too severely damaged.

==Campus life==

Students and alumni of the college are known as Gusties. Most students live in 14 residence halls on campus or in college-owned houses/apartments; a small minority live in theme areas such as the Carlson International Center, CHOICE substance-free housing, and the [[Sweden|Swedish]] House. Students with permission from the college may choose to live off campus, in St. Peter or elsewhere.

The college has an independently operated dining service, serving the Market Place cafeteria and Courtyard Cafe. [[File:Swim-Dive-Shield1.jpg|thumb|Gustavus Adolphus College Crest]]

=== Traditions ===
Traditions at Gustavus include traying down the hill from Old Main in the winter, random Gustie Rousers, stargazing on top of the academic building Olin, playing tennis in the Bubble, and streaking through the [[Linnaeus Arboretum]]. Gustie traditions are mostly exclusively known by Gusties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://weekly.blog.gustavus.edu/2013/08/30/gustavus-traditions/|title=Gustavus Traditions|website=The Gustavian Weekly|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Student organizations ===
There are more than 120 special interest groups and organizations at Gustavus Adolphus College. Students are very engaged on campus. In 2015, the Carnegie Foundation designated Gustavus a "community-engaged campus"—the highest national distinction available for higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/newsroom/news-releases/carnegie-selects-colleges-universities-2015-community-engagement-classification/|title=Carnegie Selects Colleges and Universities for 2015 Community Engagement Classification - Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active student organizations on campus have included Model United Nations, the National Forensics Debate team, and the Gustavian Society of Filmmakers. Students are encouraged to create their own clubs or teams and apply to Student Senate for funding.

Nearly 1/5 of students are active in [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek life]] at Gustavus, where there are ten recognized Greek organizations on campus (some have been suspended and are no longer recognized by the college).

=== Music ===
Many musical ensembles perform throughout the year, including the Gustavus Choir, the Choir of Christ Chapel, the Lucia Singers, the Gustavus Adolphus Symphony Orchestra, Gustavus Wind Orchestra, Gustavus Jazz Lab Band, etc.

In 1942, [[Percy Grainger]], writing in [[The Musical Quarterly]], publicised the "pathbreaking activities" – as an historically appropriate ensemble – of the college's ''A Capella Choir'' and chamber orchestra, which toured a series of concerts of music from the 13th to 20th centuries. He praised the "rare value", "practical skill" and "subtle esthetic intuition" of conductor [[Gustav Adolph Nelson|G. Adolph Nelson]].&lt;ref name = "Grainger1942"&gt;{{Cite journal | first=Percy Aldridge | last=Grainger | title=The culturizing possibilities of the instrumentally supplemented a cappella choir | journal=The Musical Quarterly | volume=XXVIII | issue=2 | date=1 April 1942 | page=163 | url=https://doi.org/10.1093/mq/XXVIII.2.160 | access-date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grainger had an opportunity to observe the work of Nelson, the choir and orchestra at close quarters by touring and performing with them that year. Nelson was the college's musical director from 1930 to 1945 and the driving force behind a group that toured the eastern states, winning both critical acclaim and financial success. He was particularly concerned to revive and share the music of the chapel, including not just voices but also the instruments that supported them, including organ, brass and strings. "Nelson, through his dedication to choral singing and to Gustavus Adolphus College, his innate musicality, and his pioneering spirit, gave birth to the ensemble now known as the Gustavus Choir."&lt;ref name = "Holdhusen2011"&gt;{{Cite book | first=David | last=Holdhusen | title=Commitment to Musical Excellence: The 75 Year History of the Gustavus Choir | publisher=Cambridge Scholars Pub. | location= | year=2011 | isbn=978-1-44382-804-8 | series=EBSCO ebook academic collection | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=c6YnBwAAQBAJ | pages=16–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theatre And Dance ===
Gustavus has a very active theatre program. Theater and dance events are a vibrant part of Gustie life, with shows every fall and spring and a musical every other year. Students do not need to be a part of the theatre program to audition for plays. The Gustavus Dance Company and the Apprentice Company hold open auditions and perform a fully produced set of work.

The college is also home to the social justice theatre troupe I Am We Are.

=== Art ===
There are two art galleries on campus, the Hillstrom Museum of Art and the Schaefer Art Gallery.

===Study abroad===

The college's [[study abroad]] program has included internships at BNU-HKBU [[United International College]] in Zhuhai, China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uic.edu.hk/en/home/news/15790-uic-welcomes-20-international-interns-aboard|title=UIC welcomes 20 international interns aboard|publisher=United International College|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118191538/http://uic.edu.hk/en/home/news/15790-uic-welcomes-20-international-interns-aboard|archivedate=2016-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gustavus is also a member of the Intercollegiate [[Sri Lanka]] Education (ISLE) consortium, run by [[Bowdoin College]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bowdoin.edu/isle/pdf/ISLE_brochure_2016_Bowdoin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
Gustavus is a founding member of the [[Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]], MIAC. Key sports at the college are [[tennis]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] &amp; diving, [[golf]], [[basketball]], [[ice hockey]], [[American football|football]], and [[soccer]]. The school's team name is the Golden Gusties, represented by a lion mascot because Gustavus Adolphus was known as "The Lion of the North." Gustavus has had three players drafted in the [[NFL Draft]]: [[Russ Buckley]] in 1940, [[Kurt Ploeger]] in 1985, and [[Ryan Hoag]] in 2003. On March 26, 2014, Gustavus announced it would not continue its men's and women's Nordic skiing team.

=== Varsity sports  ===

The Gustavus women's softball team placed third in the NCAA Division III national tournament in 2009. The Gustavus men's hockey team placed second in the NCAA Division III national tournament in 2009. The Gustavus soccer team finished second in the [[NCAA]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] national tournament in 2005 — led in part by three-time all American Robert "Bobby" Kroog. In 2003 the Gustavus men's basketball team finished second in the NCAA Division III national tournament. In the middle of the twentieth century, the Gustavus [[American football|football]] team was coached by long-time coach/AD Moose Malmquist. In addition, the women's hockey team has won seven conference titles, including six straight, and has placed in the top four nationally in 2002, 2005, 2006 and 2010. The Gustavus men's tennis team have made 11 consecutive appearances at the NCAA Division III National Championships. Gustavus Adolphus College hosted the 2013 USTA/ITA Midwest Regional Championships at the Swanson Indoor Tennis Center and Brown Outdoor Courts in St. Peter, Minnesota.  In 2003 [[Steve Wilkinson (tennis)|Steve Wilkinson]]'s squad placed third at the NCAA Division III Championships as well as a first-place finish at the ITA Indoor Championships. Steve Wilkinson retired in 2009 as the winningest coach in college tennis history with a record of 929-279. Gustavus player Eric Butorac, closed out his senior season of 2003 by winning both the NCAA Division III singles and doubles championships, with Kevin Whipple as his partner. In 2003, Eric Butorac turned pro. He is now a doubles specialist, and has achieved success being the no. 3 ranked American doubles player for the bulk of the past six years.

A couple of women alumni who played ice hockey at Gustavus, have gone on to represent the United States at the [[2016 Women's Bandy World Championship]], and one represents the Unified Korean team at the 2018 Winter Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://athletics.blog.gustavus.edu/2016/02/18/from-hockey-to-bandy-gustavus-alumnae-to-compete-in-world-bandy-championship-this-weekend-2/ "From Hockey to Bandy: Gustavus Alumnae to Compete in World Bandy Championship This Weekend" Posted on February 18th, 2016 by Nick Hoelmer], read on February 19th, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directors' Cup===

Gustavus placed 8th in the 2008–09 Learfield Sports Directors' Cup standings. The [[Directors' Cup]] is the only all-sports competition in intercollegiate athletics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacda.com/directorscup/nacda-directorscup.html|title=NACDA.COM :: NACDA Official Web Site|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Division III, standings are based on national tournament finishes in 18 sports. In 2002–03 Gustavus placed a school-best sixth in the Directors' Cup standings.

=== Fight Song ===
Also known as the Gustie Rouser;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Come on you Gusties, Fight on, Fight on. Shout out the battle cry of victory. Come on you Gusties fight to the end, fight on for dear old G – A – C. Gusties will shine tonight, Gusties will shine, Gusties will shine tonight, Gusties will shone. Beat 'em, bust 'em, that's our custom, Gusties will shine!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Media==
Gustavus Adolphus College is home to several publications and broadcasters:
* ''The Gustavian Weekly'', first published in 1920, is the campus newspaper.  Its predecessor was the ''College Breezes''.  In addition, there were various other names for the student paper from June 1891 into 1902.
* ''Firethorne'' is an arts and literary magazine published twice per year. Students submit short stories, poetry, creative nonfiction, photography, visual art, or other creative content.
* KGSM is a webcast-only radio station operated entirely by students. The studio moved to the Beck Academic Hall in 2011 to improve the quality of its webstream and added a digital audio workstation.
* The newest campus media outlet is GAC TV. Started by a group of students interested in bringing television broadcasting to campus, GAC TV became an instant success when students started watching the weekly show before free on-campus films.
* The ''Gustavian'' yearbook publishes a yearbook for each class and dates back to 1920 with predecessor publications released under different names dating back to 1904.
*  TV broadcasts from Gustavus are released over Internet II.

[[File:Haferlschuhe mit Krampen fcm.jpg|thumb|Haferlschuh]] 

The '''Haferlschuh''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhaːfɐlˌʃuː|lang}}) is the traditional [[Bavaria]]n shoe. It was designed originally as a work shoe for alpine terrain, but it developed into a timeless classic. In Bavaria it may also be called a ''Bundschuh''. In Austria, it is known as a ''Schützenschuh.''

According to legend, in 1803 Franz Schratt, an alpine shoemaker from [[Oberstdorf]] (located in the [[Allgäu]] region of the [[Bavarian Alps]]), developed the Haferlschuh inspired by the goat hoof. However, Sternke asserts that the Haferlschuh is much older. With a boatlike front and a nailed sole, the shoes gave the wearer stability.

Since 1900, the Haferlschuh has become a part of many alpine [[Tracht|Trachten]]. Nonetheless the Haferlschuh is still worn as an everyday shoe, and not just for special occasions like the [[Oktoberfest]].

'''''Imaginary Conversations''''' is a publication consisting of five volumes of imaginary conversations, mainly between historical people of classical Greece and Rome, composed by the English author [[Walter Savage Landor]]. Landor's fame rests on this prose. The work is of great interest as a specimen of the poetic prose full of rich imagery &amp; ornate diction as seen in De Quincey.

==Background==
The Imaginary Conversations were begun when Landor, aged 46, was living with his family in [[Florence]] during 1821 where he had rooms in the Medici Palace and later rented the Villa Castigilione. The idea of the compositions began during his childhood as he wrote later: ''"When I was younger..[a]mong the chief pleasures of my life, and among the commonest of my occupations was the bringing before me such heroes and heroines of antiquity, such poets and sages, such of the prosperous and unfortunate as most interested me … Engaging them in conversations best suited to their characters..."''.&lt;ref&gt;H Van Thal ''Landor:a biographical anthology'' (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; The unenthusiastic reception of Landor's play “Count Julian” demonstrated that Landor, while adept at dialogue, lacked the dramatic capability necessary to convert it to stage performance, and he destroyed another tragedy “Ferranti and Giulio” in frustration at his publishers. 

At Florence, Landor was corresponding with [[Robert Southey]], who had planned to write a book of "Colloquies", and they considered collaborating on a project. Landor had finished fifteen dialogues by 9 March 1822, and sent them to [[Longman]]'s company.  Longman would not publish, so by the influence of his friend Julius Hare, he managed to get an agreement with the company of Taylor &amp; Hessey to publish them. Some disputes with the publishers followed in which both Southey and [[William Wordsworth]] became involved, not without some embarrassment to Southey as one of the "Conversations" was between Southey and Porson on the merits of Wordsworth's poetry. During 1824, two volumes were published with eighteen conversations in each. The third volume of Imaginary Conversations was published by Henry Colburn during 1828 but Julius Hare was frustrated by Colburn’s delays, and the fourth and fifth volumes were finally published by James Duncan during 1829. Over the succeeding years Landor published occasional Imaginary Conversations as individual publications and collated a number of them during 1853.

==Selected conversations==

==[[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s Appraisal==
{{cquote|The very finest flower of his dialogues is probably to be found in the single volume  ''Imaginary Conversations of Greeks and Romans''; his command of passion and pathos may be tested by its success in the distilled and concentrated tragedy of ''Tiberius and Vipsania'', where for once he shows a quality more proper to romantic than classical imagination: the subtle and sublime and terrible power to enter the dark vestibule of distraction, to throw the whole force of his fancy, the whole fire of his spirit, into the shadowing passion (as Shakespeare calls it) of gradually imminent insanity. Yet, if this and all other studies from ancient history or legend could be subtracted from the volume of his work, enough would be left whereon to rest the foundation of a fame which time could not sensibly impair.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica 1882&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Interliterary mentions==
''Imaginary Conversations'' was a favorite book of the character ''Tibby'' in E.M. Forster's 1910 novel, ''[[Howards End]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E.M. ''Howards End''. Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 11, {{ISBN|978-0-679-40668-6}} (US)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mentioned in the book and film &lt;i&gt;84 Charing Cross Road&lt;/i&gt; by Helene Hanff.

In "The Gay Science", Nietzsche praises Landor as a 'master of prose' for "Imaginary Conversations".

==Plot==
Ayumi Mamiya is a witch cursed to lose her powers but there is one boy who can break the spell and save her. Haruo Yoshikawa thinks he is a normal boy but unknown to him his three sisters are witches who use their magical powers to keep him protected and ignorant about the existence of magic. Now Ayumi must wake up Haruo's latent powers to save herself but his sisters will have none of that.

==Characters==
; {{nihongo|Haruo Yoshikawa|吉川 春生|Yoshikawa Haruo}}
: {{anime voices|[[Mitsuhiro Ichiki]]|[[Clint Bickham]]}}
: Haruo is an average junior high school boy who has a perfect attendance record at school and doesn't have any long-term goals aside from living a long life. He lives with his three sisters, and has no idea that they are ''mahoutsukai'' (magic users). Haruo has latent magic powers, but he is not aware of this, believing he and his family are perfectly ordinary. His powers are revealed to be extraordinary on two occasions; when a ghost takes over his spirit and is able to channel extreme power through him and when Michiru kidnaps him during a school play and he becomes so angry at how she has hurt his friends he that he awakens and is able to blow apart her castle and transport everyone home along with turning back time so no one except Michiru remembers the event. Maika and his other sisters ensure that Haruo is kept in the dark about them using magic through liberal application of magic memory erasing hammers (no less than three hammers simultaneously at times). It is showing that this is done so often he occasionally seems aware at some level of the erasal asking if "something happened" and once stating he had a lot of gaps in his memory recently.     He seems somewhat naive, and always in the dark about the feelings of people (mainly women who like him) around him. However, he cares about the well being of others. 
He seems to want for the most part a quiet life he is often showing trying to relax and do normal things such as watch TV or just hang out and seems wary of his sisters antics and reluctant to get involved on schemes but will be kind and always help if he can
Haruo is in his third year of junior high school (grade 9), in classroom B. Halfway though the manga series, he accidentally found out about magic but at first believes that his sisters are possessed demons, until his latent magic powers awaken after a misadventure.However, after this he still has a hard time believing in magic. In the last episode of the anime, Haruo is revealed to be an avatar, or incarnation of the Demon Lord/Maoh. "Haru" means "spring" in Japanese, as he is the oldest in his family.
; {{nihongo|Ayumi Mamiya|魔宮 あゆみ|Mamiya Ayumi}}
: {{anime voices|[[Sakura Nogawa]]|[[Jessica Boone]]}}
: Ayumi Mamiya is a young witch who was cursed during her childhood. The only one who can lift this curse is Haruo Yoshikawa, which forces her to study at the same school and move into the Yoshikawa residence as a maid. For most of the series, Ayumi flirts with and casts spells on Haruo in order to seduce him and "make him a man". Because of this, she and Maika constantly argue and get into fights - which Ayumi inevitably loses. She claims that her curse is the reason for her seduction attempts, although in the last episode, it is revealed that she has truly come to love him.
; {{nihongo|Maika Yoshikawa|吉川 舞夏|Yoshikawa Maika}}
: {{anime voices|[[Mai Nakahara]]|[[Kira Vincent-Davis]]}}
: Maika is the oldest daughter of the Yoshikawa family. She can use magic, and loves cooking for her brother and sisters. She has long lilac-coloured hair, often tied back with green ribbons. She is very protective of her brother Haruo, and was immediately suspicious of Ayumi's intentions (which were justified). The others often accuse her of having a brother complex. Hints of this occurs as she tries to get closer to him and even comments on how "hot" he is. As a toddler she "brainwashed" Haruo in his sleep by chanting "Big Brother and Maika together forever" repeatedly, and her usually caring and lady-like personality is replaced by a possessive jealousy whenever any female tries to get close her brother. She is even able to transform into a green-skinned demon when she becomes especially jealous. "Ka" means "summer" in Japanese, as she is the second oldest in the Yoshikawa family.
; {{nihongo|Chiaki Yoshikawa|吉川 千秋|Yoshikawa Chiaki}}
: {{anime voices|[[Kanako Sakai]]|[[Luci Christian]]}}
: Chiaki is the middle sister of the Yoshikawa family. She can also use magic, and loves working out and eating food. She has long, violet hair, often tied back with a red ribbon. She is clueless, honest, sincere, and completely without guile and malice and the most normal of the sisters.. "Aki" means "Autumn" in Japanese, as she is the third born in her family.
; {{nihongo|Fuyuno Yoshikawa|吉川 冬乃|Yoshikawa Fuyuno}}
: {{anime voices|[[Tomoko Kaneda]]|[[Hilary Haag]]}}
: Fuyuno is the youngest sister of the Yoshikawa family. She can also use magic and she loves just about anything that involves making money. (Her fantasy is swimming in oodles of cash). This is a subject that makes her adopt the demeanor (and voice) of a Scrooge-like [[miser]]. Many times she comes up with excuses for the strange events which occur to non-magic people, and is fantastic at problem solving. She has short periwinkle hair with a yellow and black ribbon. "Fuyu" means "winter" in Japanese, as she is the youngest in her family.
; {{nihongo|Hajime Hario|針生 ハジメ|Hario Hajime}}
: {{anime voices|[[Kōki Harasawa|Katsuhiro Harasawa]]|[[Greg Ayres]]}}
: A friend of Haruo's from his class. Hajime Hario is generally loud and outspoken, and is always on the lookout for girls. The sound of a rooster call typically follows him due to his red [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] giving him a rooster-like appearance, but only in the anime. Hajime is one of the two members of the "Supernatural Science Club", and thus is constantly showing up when incidents mainly caused by the witches occur. Because of this, he and Sora are frequent victims of the memory loss hammers.
; {{nihongo|Sora Fujiwara|藤原 宇宙|Fujiwara Sora}}
: {{anime voices|[[Sachie Abe]]}}
: Another friend of Haruo's from his class at school, Sora is a boy with glasses who has no dialogue and speaks by taking pictures. But, somehow others (especially Hajime) knows what he's saying. He is always seen with his camera. In the original [[manga]], Sora did not wear glasses and talked. Sora is one of the two members of the "Supernatural Science Club".
; {{nihongo|Yuri Kurosu|黒須 ゆり|Kurosu Yuri}}
: {{anime voices|[[Noriko Namiki]]|[[Carli Mosier]]}}
: Yuri is the school's #1 idol and the student council president, but she gets some unwelcome competition when Ayumi transfers in. She met Haruo when she was a little girl, and instantly fell in love. She once even made a bento for Haruo, only to be thwarted by Maika. Her hair changes colour (black to blue/silver) when she uses her battle magic, and instead of a broom/wand she has a large sword she rides like a surfboard. Yuri is still in love with Haruo, and has indecent dreams about him, and gets irrationally angry when Ayumi is with him. She often claims that Ayumi's behaviour is "Against School Policy" as an excuse to see Haruo, since she, as Student President, must see that all rules are followed. Her name [[yuri (genre)|yuri]] is actually a pun on the genre as many of the female students have the hots for her including the SC vice president. Hajime has even came up with a fantasy fetish in which she and Ayumi are about to kiss.
; {{nihongo|Marin Nijihara|虹原 真鈴|Nijihara Marin}}
: {{anime voices|[[Haruko Momoi]]|[[Hannah Alcorn]]}}
: A [[Catholic]] witch hunter who thinks that Haruo was sent from heaven and needs protection from witches (especially Ayumi). She works with Ayumi, Yuri, and/or Maika whenever she feels that they have a common cause. Marin is an incompetent and clumsy fool whose attacks inflict more damage on herself than any of the "evil-witches" that she so adamantly hunts. It's unclear whether Marin has deeper feelings for Haruo, or if she just admires him for what she calls "keeping away evil witches". A hint is this was when she fantasized about her and Haruo beating the Yoshikawa sisters together. Marin has never purified any witch (if you don't count the witch she purified in Michiru's world). Many jokes seem to imply she is not as wealthy as others.
; {{nihongo|Rika Anju|杏樹 リカ|Anju Rika}}
: {{anime voices|[[Nana Inoue]]|[[Tiffany Grant]]}}
: An enigmatic maid sent by Ayumi's father into the service of the Yoshikawa household, apparently to collect data. An effective maid, she is taciturn and quite able to cause trouble and thwart Ayumi's attempts to seduce Haruo. Her seeming obliviousness to the present conceals a calculating cunning that rivals even Fuyuno's. It is later revealed that she is an artificially-created human. The sound of a cymbal solo - a short musical quotation from [[The Terminator]] - sounds whenever she goes into action.
; {{nihongo|Michiru Mamiya|魔宮 みちる|Mamiya Michiru}}
: {{anime voices|[[Natsuko Kuwatani]]|[[Monica Rial]]}}
: Ayumi's younger sister, who is determined to stop Ayumi from breaking her curse and become head of the Mamiya family in her place. She is aware that Haruo's powers extend far beyond the ability to break Ayumi's curse and she intends to use that power to take over the world. Michiru is unbelievably powerful and extremely malevolent. As seen when she took Haruo during the play, her powers surpass those of the other girls combined.
; {{nihongo|Tetsuko Hongō|本郷 哲子|Hongō Tetsuko}}
: {{anime voices|[[Noriko Rikimaru]]|[[Christine Auten]]}}
: Haruo's class teacher, who seems to always be nearby whenever something strange happens. She also always seems to know what's happening. It is later revealed that she is an artificially-created human immune to certain kinds of magic.
; {{nihongo|Melissa Maelstrom|メリッサ・メイルシュトローム|Merissa Meirushutorōmu}}
: {{anime voices|[[Ui Miyazaki]]}}
: A manga only character. Melissa is the 10-year-old head of the Maelstrom family, a group of Necromancers. Because of a curse of infertility, they are going extinct. She believes that if she has children with Haruto the curse will be broken so she kidnaps him. When that fails she decides to move next door.

Then they go to further back to when Haruo and Maika were younger and see Maika is brainwashing Haruo in his sleep. Wanting to know what had happened earlier, they travel further back and see Maika arguing with Haruo and saying she hates him. However, they all are shocked to learn it's just a rehearsal for the play "Hansel and Gretel". Ayumi is not satisfied so she goes back even further to dig up some real dirt but only to see that Maika loves her brother more than they expected (as a newborn she stops crying when Haruo touched her hand).

Marin finally gives Haruo her lunch (not the whole box) and they all become normal after drinking magical tea.

==Reception==
{{Over-quotation|date=August 2016}}
"For a romantic comedy, Magikano has precious little romance. Or comedy for that matter. Indeed, with a third of the series already over by the close of this volume, it seems devoid of any ambition at all beyond testing how far sheer hyperactivity can be taken before viewers begin using their DVDs as doggy chew-toys." — Carl Kimlinger, ''[[Anime News Network]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Kimlinger |first=Carl |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/magikano/dvd-1 |title=Magikano DVD 1- A New Witch in Town |work=Anime News Network |date=April 10, 2008 |accessdate=February 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Magikano has potential based on what's here so I'm curious as to how the two remaining volumes will play out but I'm just expecting more light and silly fun with no real meat to it." — Chris Beveridge, ''Mania''.&lt;ref name="Anime on DVD and Mania"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3373">'''Medical Code of Ethics '''  this document establishing the ethical rules of behaviour of physicians and dental practitioners, defining the priorities of their professional work, showing the principles in the relations with patients, other physicians and the rest of community.
 
== Rules ==
The greatest ethical imperative for the physician is the welfare of the patient.

The physician should approach patients with consideration, respecting their personal dignity, right to intimacy and privacy. 

The physician should perform all diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive procedures with due exactitude and devoting the necessary time.
 
The physician has the duty to maintain confidentiality. Information obtained in the course of physician's professional duties concerning the patient and his background is to be kept confidential. The death of the patient does not release the physician from the duty of maintaining confidentiality.
 
It is the duty of every physician to continually update and develop professional knowledge and skills as well as to share them with co-workers.

A '''mesostic''' is a [[poem]] or other [[Writing| text]] arranged so that a vertical phrase intersects lines of horizontal text. It is similar to an [[acrostic]], but with the vertical phrase intersecting somewhere in the midst of the line, as opposed to the beginning of each line.

The practice of using index words to select pieces from a preexisting text was developed by [[Jackson Mac Low]] as "diastics". It was used extensively by the experimental composer [[John Cage]] (Walsh 2001).

There are two types of mesostic: fifty percent and one hundred percent. (See also the example below.)
* In a fifty-percent mesostic, according to Andrew Culver (John Cage's assistant), "Between any two [capitalized] letters, you can't have the second [letter]." &lt;ref&gt;Cage 57.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In a one-hundred-percent mesostic, "Between any two [capitalized] letters, you can't have either [letter]." &lt;ref&gt;Cage 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Below, an example of a one-hundred-percent mesostic:

         '''KITCHEN'''
 
   let us maKe
       of thIs
       modesT
         plaCe
     a room Holding
 tons of lovE
        (&amp;, Naturally, much good food, too)

It qualifies as a one-hundred-percent mesostic because there is no ''k'' or ''i'' in the text between the capital ''K'' of line 1 and the capital ''I'' of line 2 –
   let us ma'''K'''&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;
       &lt;u&gt;of th&lt;/u&gt;'''I'''s
– no ''i'' or ''t'' between the capital ''I'' and ''T'' –
       of th'''I'''&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;
       &lt;u&gt;modes&lt;/u&gt;'''T'''
– and so on.

[[File:Neath abbey, Glamorgan - founded by Richard De Cranville, circa 1129.jpeg|thumb|Neath abbey, 1849]]
'''Neath Abbey''' ({{lang-cy|Abaty Nedd}}) was a [[Cistercian]] [[monastery]], located near the present-day town of [[Neath]] in [[South Wales]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]. It was once the largest [[abbey]] in [[Wales]]. Substantial ruins can still be seen, and are in the care of [[Cadw]]. [[Tudor period|Tudor]] historian [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] called Neath Abbey "the fairest abbey of all Wales."

Neath Abbey is also the name of an area of Neath near to the abbey ruins.

== History ==
[[Image:Neath abbey.JPG|right|thumb|Ruins of Neath Abbey]]
Neath Abbey was established in 1129 AD when [[Richard I de Grenville]] (d.post 1142), one of the [[Twelve Knights of Glamorgan]], gave {{convert|8000|acre}} of his estate in [[Glamorgan]], [[Wales]], to [[Savigniac]] [[monk]]s from western [[Normandy]].&lt;ref name=ggat&gt;{{Watprn|GGAT|00585w|title=Neath Abbey}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first monks arrived in 1130. Following the assumption of the Savigniac order into the [[Cistercian]] order in 1147, Neath Abbey also became a Cistercian house. The abbey was ravaged by the Welsh uprisings of the 13th century.&lt;ref name=coflein&gt;{{Watprn|coflein|133|title=Neath Abbey}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
During the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] by King [[Henry VIII of England]] the last abbot, [[Lleision ap Thomas]], managed to buy time through payment of a large fine in 1536, but the abbey was dissolved in 1539.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-LLEI-THO-1513.html|title=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion |last=Saunders |first=Evan John|year=1970|chapter=Lleision ap Thomas|accessdate=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, the abbey was turned into a large estate, initially granted to Richard Williams, although by 1600 it was owned by [[John Herbert (Secretary of State)|Sir John Herbert]], and had a substantial Tudor mansion occupying a part of the cloisters. The mansion itself was only habitable for 100 years or so, before being abandoned as the site became a scene of industry.&lt;ref name=coflein/&gt;

==Industrial use==
By 1730, some of the buildings were being used for [[copper smelting]], and the rest were abandoned. In the late 18th century, an [[iron foundry]] was opened near the abbey ruins by a company owned by the Price, [[Fox family of Falmouth|Fox]] and Tregelles families. The ruined walls of both the Abbey and later mansion were gradually engulfed in quantities of industrial waste. The ownership of the site passed to the Rice family, [[Baron Dynevor|Barons Dynevor]], and it was in the 1920s, under [[Walter FitzUryan Rice, 7th Baron Dynevor]] that a local group of amateur archaeologists began the process of uncovering the medieval ruins.&lt;ref name=nas/&gt;

==Archaeology==
[[Image:NeathAbbey.JPG|thumb|Ruins of Neath Abbey]]
The [[archaeology]] of the abbey was eventually excavated between 1924 and 1935. The Neath Antiquarian Society was the driving force in this early archaology, in which 7,000 tons of slag and other industrial waste were removed by hand, to uncover the abbey ruins.&lt;ref name=nas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spanglefish.com/neathantiquariansociety/index.asp?pageid=637090|title=The Neath Abbey Research Party|website=Neath Antiquarian Society|access-date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 the ownership passed to the Ministry of Works, who undertook further stabilization of the walls. In 2014 [[Cadw]], the successor body charged with the sites care, began a substantial project to further protect and stabilize parts of the ruins. The site is open to the public with some interpretation display boards on site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cadw.gov.wales/daysout/neathabbeyandgatehouse/?lang=en|website=Cadw, the Welsh Government's historic environment service|title=Neath Abbey and Gatehouse|access-date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gatehouse==
North of the abbey ruins are the remains of the gatehouse which would have controlled access into the abbey precinct. It now stands on New Road alongside the playground of Abbey Primary School. It was originally built around 1130, but the most prominent surviving features, two pointed windows that face onto the road, date from the 13th or 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{watprn|GGAT|00587w|title=Neath Abbey Gatehouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Commercial use ==
The area adjacent to the ruins is used by a car retailer and a number of smaller businesses and workshops.

The site has been used to film several episodes of television series [[Doctor Who]]. The Time Lord (played by [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) and his companion [[Amy Pond]] ([[Karen Gillan]]) have filmed several times at the site, which was transformed into a complete structure.

The site was also used for shots during the filming of the BBC television series Merlin, for example the castle of the ancient kings where Arthur rediscovered the round table in Series 3 episode 13

{{Cognitive}}
'''Numerical cognition''' is a subdiscipline of [[cognitive science]] that studies the cognitive, developmental and neural bases of [[number]]s and [[mathematics]]. As with many cognitive science endeavors, this is a highly interdisciplinary topic, and includes researchers in [[cognitive psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive linguistics]]. This discipline, although it may interact with questions in the [[philosophy of mathematics]], is primarily concerned with [[empirical]] questions.

Topics included in the domain of numerical cognition include:
*How do [[Number sense in animals|non-human animals process numerosity]]?
*How do infants acquire an understanding of numbers (and how much is inborn)?
*How do humans associate linguistic symbols with numerical quantities?
*How do these capacities underlie our ability to perform complex calculations?
*What are the neural bases of these abilities, both in humans and in non-humans?
*What metaphorical capacities and processes allow us to extend our numerical understanding into complex domains such as the concept of [[infinity]], the [[infinitesimal]] or the concept of the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] in calculus?

== Comparative studies ==
A variety of research has demonstrated that non-human animals, including rats, lions and various species of primates have an [[approximate number system|approximate sense of number]] (referred to as "[[Number sense in animals|numerosity]]") (for a review, see {{Harvnb|Dehaene|1997}}). For example, when a rat is trained to press a bar 8 or 16 times to receive a food reward, the number of bar presses will approximate a [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] or Normal distribution with peak around 8 or 16 bar presses. When rats are more hungry, their bar pressing behavior is more rapid, so by showing that the peak number of bar presses is the same for either well-fed or hungry rats, it is possible to disentangle time and number of bar presses. In addition, in a few species the [[parallel individuation system]] has been shown, for example in the case of [[guppy|guppies]] which successfully discriminated between 1 and 4 other individuals.&lt;ref name= "agrillo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agrillo|first=Christian|title=Evidence for Two Numerical Systems That Are Similar in Humans and Guppies|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031923|pages=e31923|pmid=22355405|pmc=3280231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, researchers have set up hidden speakers in the African savannah to test natural (untrained) behavior in lions {{Harv|McComb|Packer|Pusey|1994}}. These speakers can play a number of lion calls, from 1 to 5. If a single lioness hears, for example, three calls from unknown lions, she will leave, while if she is with four of her sisters, they will go and explore. This suggests that not only can lions tell when they are "outnumbered" but that they can do this on the basis of signals from different sensory modalities, suggesting that numerosity is a multisensory concept.

== Developmental studies ==
Developmental psychology studies have shown that human infants, like non-human animals, have an approximate sense of number. For example, in one study, infants were repeatedly presented with arrays of (in one block) 16 dots. Careful controls were in place to eliminate information from "non-numerical" parameters such as total surface area, luminance, circumference, and so on. After the infants had been presented with many displays containing 16 items, they [[Habituation|habituated]], or stopped looking as long at the display. Infants were then presented with a display containing 8 items, and they looked longer at the novel display.

Because of the numerous controls that were in place to rule out non-numerical factors, the experimenters infer that six-month-old infants are sensitive to differences between 8 and 16. Subsequent experiments, using similar methodologies showed that 6-month-old infants can discriminate numbers differing by a 2:1 ratio (8 vs. 16 or 16 vs. 32) but not by a 3:2 ratio (8 vs. 12 or 16 vs. 24). However, 10-month-old infants succeed both at the 2:1 and the 3:2 ratio, suggesting an increased sensitivity to numerosity differences with age (for a review of this literature see {{Harvnb|Feigenson|Dehaene|Spelke|2004}}).

In another series of studies, [[Karen Wynn]] showed that infants as young as five months are able to do very simple additions (e.g., 1 + 1 = 2) and subtractions (3 - 1 = 2). To demonstrate this, Wynn used a "violation of expectation" paradigm, in which infants were shown (for example) one Mickey Mouse doll going behind a screen, followed by another. If, when the screen was lowered, infants were presented with only one Mickey (the "impossible event") they looked longer than if they were shown two Mickeys (the "possible" event). Further studies by Karen Wynn and Koleen McCrink found that although infants' ability to compute exact outcomes only holds over small numbers, infants can compute approximate outcomes of larger addition and subtraction events (e.g., "5+5" and "10-5" events).

There is debate about how much these infant systems actually contain in terms of number concepts, harkening to the classic [[nature versus nurture]] debate.  {{Harvnb|Gelman|Gallistel|1978}} suggested that a child innately has the concept of natural number, and only has to map this onto the words used in her language. {{Harvnb|Carey | 2004}}, {{Harvnb|Carey|2009}}  disagreed, saying that these systems can only encode large numbers in an [[approximate number system|approximate way]], where language-based natural numbers can be exact. Without language, only numbers 1 to 4 are believed to have an exact representation, through the [[parallel individuation system]]. One promising approach is to see if cultures that lack number words can deal with natural numbers. The results so far are mixed (e.g., {{Harvnb|Pica|Lemer|Izard|Dehaene|2004}});  {{Harvnb|Butterworth|Reeve|2008}},  {{Harvnb|Butterworth|Reeve| Lloyd|2008}}.

== Neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies ==
Human neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that regions of the [[parietal lobe]], including the [[intraparietal sulcus]] (IPS) and the [[inferior parietal lobule]] (IPL) are activated when subjects are asked to perform calculation tasks. Based on both human [[neuroimaging]] and [[neuropsychology]], Stanislas Dehaene and colleagues have suggested that these two parietal structures play complementary roles. The IPS is thought to house the circuitry that is fundamentally involved in numerical estimation {{Harv|Piazza|Izard|Pinel|Le Bihan|2004}}, number comparison ({{Harvnb|Pinel|Dehaene|Riviere|Le Bihan|2001}}; {{Harvnb|Pinel|Piazza|Le Bihan|Dehaene|2004}}) and on-line calculation, or quantity processing (often tested with subtraction) while the IPL is thought to be involved in rote memorization, such as multiplication (see {{Harvnb|Dehaene|1997}}). Thus, a patient with a lesion to the IPL may be able to subtract, but not multiply, and vice versa for a patient with a lesion to the IPS. In addition to these parietal regions, regions of the [[frontal lobe]] are also active in calculation tasks. These activations overlap with regions involved in language processing such as [[Broca's area]] and regions involved in [[working memory]] and [[attention]].  Additionally, the inferotemporal cortex is implicated in processing the numerical shapes and symbols, necessary for calculations with Arabic digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piazza|first=Manuela|last2=Eger|first2=Evelyn|title=Neural foundations and functional specificity of number representations|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.09.025|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=83|pages=257–273|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.09.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; More current research has highlighted the networks involved with multiplication and subtraction tasks. Multiplication is often learned through rote memorization and verbal repetitions, and neuroimaging studies &lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Xue"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Jamie I.D.|last2=Xue|first2=Qilin|title=Cognitive Arithmetic Across Cultures|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=130|issue=2|pages=299–315|doi=10.1037//0096-3445.130.2.299}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that multiplication uses a left lateralized network of the inferior frontal cortex and the superior-middle temporal gyri in addition to the IPL and IPS.

Single-unit [[neurophysiology]] in monkeys has also found neurons in the frontal cortex and in the intraparietal sulcus that respond to numbers. Andreas Nieder ({{Harvnb|Nieder|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Nieder|Freedman|Miller|2002}}; {{Harvnb|Nieder|Miller|2004}}) trained monkeys to perform a "delayed match-to-sample" task. For example, a monkey might be presented with a field of four dots, and is required to keep that in memory after the display is taken away. Then, after a delay period of several seconds, a second display is presented. If the number on the second display match that from the first, the monkey has to release a lever. If it is different, the monkey has to hold the lever. Neural activity recorded during the delay period showed that neurons in the intraparietal sulcus and the frontal cortex had a "preferred numerosity", exactly as predicted by behavioral studies. That is, a certain number might fire strongly for four, but less strongly for three or five, and even less for two or six. Thus, we say that these neurons were "tuned" for specific quantities. Note that these neuronal responses followed [[Weber-Fechner law|Weber's law]], as has been demonstrated for other sensory dimensions, and consistent with the ratio dependence observed for non-human animals' and infants' numerical behavior {{Harv|Nieder|Miller|2003}}.

It is important to note that while primates have remarkably similar brains to humans, there are differences in function, ability, and sophistication. They make for good preliminary test subjects, but do not show small differences that are the result of different evolutionary tracks and environment. However, in the realm of number, they share many similarities. As identified in monkeys, neurons selectively tuned to number were identified in the bilateral intraparietal sulci and prefrontal cortex in humans. Piazza and colleagues&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piazza|first=Manuela|last2=Izard|first2=Véronique|last3=Pinel|first3=Philippe|last4=Bihan|first4=Denis Le|last5=Dehaene|first5=Stanislas|title=Tuning Curves for Approximate Numerosity in the Human Intraparietal Sulcus|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2004.10.014|journal=Neuron|volume=44|issue=3|pages=547–555|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2004.10.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigated this using fMRI, presenting participants with sets of dots where they either had to make same-different judgments or larger-smaller judgments. The sets of dots consisted of base numbers 16 and 32 dots with ratios in 1.25, 1.5, and 2. Deviant numbers were included in some trials in larger or smaller amounts than the base numbers. Participants displayed similar activation patterns as Neider&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nieder|first=Andreas|last2=Miller|first2=Earl K.|title=Coding of Cognitive Magnitude|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/s0896-6273(02)01144-3|journal=Neuron|volume=37|issue=1|pages=149–157|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)01144-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in the monkeys. The [[intraparietal sulcus]] and the [[prefrontal cortex]], also implicated in number, communicate in approximating number and it was found in both species that the parietal neurons of the IPS had short firing latencies, whereas the frontal neurons had longer firing latencies. This supports the notion that number is first processed in the IPS and, if needed, is then transferred to the associated frontal neurons in the [[prefrontal cortex]] for further numerations and applications. Humans displayed Gaussian curves in the tuning curves of approximate magnitude. This aligned with monkeys, displaying a similarly structured mechanism in both species with classic Gaussian curves relative to the increasingly deviant numbers with 16 and 32 as well as habituation. The results followed [[Weber's Law]], with accuracy decreasing as the ratio between numbers became smaller. This supports the findings made by Neider&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nieder|first=Andreas|last2=Miller|first2=Earl K.|date=2004-05-11|title=A parieto-frontal network for visual numerical information in the monkey|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/19/7457|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=101|issue=19|pages=7457–7462|doi=10.1073/pnas.0402239101|issn=0027-8424|pmid=15123797|pmc=409940}}&lt;/ref&gt; in macaque monkeys and shows definitive evidence for an [[approximate number system|approximate number logarithmic scale]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berteletti|first=Ilaria|last2=Lucangeli|first2=Daniela|last3=Piazza|first3=Manuela|last4=Dehaene|first4=Stanislas|last5=Zorzi|first5=Marco|title=Numerical estimation in preschoolers.|url=https://doi.org/10.1037/a0017887|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|pages=545–551|doi=10.1037/a0017887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khanum|first=Saeeda|last2=Hanif|first2=Rubina|last3=Spelke|first3=Elizabeth S.|last4=Berteletti|first4=Ilaria|last5=Hyde|first5=Daniel C.|date=2016-10-20|title=Effects of Non-Symbolic Approximate Number Practice on Symbolic Numerical Abilities in Pakistani Children|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164436|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=11|issue=10|pages=e0164436|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0164436|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; in humans.

With an established mechanism for approximating non-symbolic number in both humans and primates, a necessary further investigation is needed to determine if this mechanism is innate and present in children, which would suggest an inborn ability to process numerical stimuli much like humans are born ready to process language. Cantlon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cantlon|first=Jessica F.|last2=Brannon|first2=Elizabeth M.|last3=Carter|first3=Elizabeth J.|last4=Pelphrey|first4=Kevin A.|date=2006-04-11|title=Functional Imaging of Numerical Processing in Adults and 4-y-Old Children|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040125|journal=PLOS Biology|language=en|volume=4|issue=5|pages=e125|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040125|issn=1545-7885}}&lt;/ref&gt; and colleagues set out to investigate this in 4 year old healthy, normally developing children in parallel with adults. A similar task to Piazza's&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; was used in this experiment, without the judgment tasks. Dot arrays of varying size and number were used, with 16 and 32 as the base numerosities. in each block, 232 stimuli were presented with 20 deviant numerosities of a 2.0 ratio both larger and smaller. For example, out of the 232 trials, 16 dots were presented in varying size and distance but 10 of those trials had 8 dots, and 10 of those trials had 32 dots, making up the 20 deviant stimuli. The same applied to the blocks with 32 as the base numerosity. To ensure the adults and children were attending to the stimuli, they put 3 fixation points throughout the trial where the participant had to move a joystick to move forward. Their findings indicated that the adults in the experiment had significant activation of the IPS when viewing the deviant number stimuli, aligning with what was previously found in the aforementioned paragraph. In the 4 year olds, they found significant activation of the IPS to the deviant number stimuli, resembling the activation found in adults. There were some differences in the activations, with adults displaying more robust bilateral activation, where the 4 year olds primarily showed activation in their right IPS and activated 112 less voxels than the adults. This suggests that at age 4, children have an established mechanism of neurons in the IPS tuned for processing non-symbolic numerosities. Other studies have gone deeper into this mechanism in children and discovered that children do also represent approximate numbers on a [[logarithmic scale]], aligning with the claims made by Piazza in adults.

A study by Izard&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Izard|first=Véronique|last2=Sann|first2=Coralie|last3=Spelke|first3=Elizabeth S.|last4=Streri|first4=Arlette|date=2009-06-23|title=Newborn infants perceive abstract numbers|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/25/10382|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=25|pages=10382–10385|doi=10.1073/pnas.0812142106|issn=0027-8424|pmid=19520833}}&lt;/ref&gt; and colleagues investigated abstract number representations in infants using a different paradigm than the previous researchers because of the nature and developmental stage of the infants. For infants, they examined abstract number with both auditory and visual stimuli with a looking-time paradigm. The sets used were 4vs.12, 8vs.16, and 4vs.8. The auditory stimuli consisted of tones in different frequencies with a set number of tones, with some deviant trials where the tones were shorter but more numerous or longer and less numerous to account for duration and its potential confounds. After the auditory stimuli was presented with 2 minutes of familiarization, the visual stimuli was presented with a congruent or incongruent array of colorful dots with facial features. they remained on the screen until the infant looked away. They found that infants looked longer at the stimuli that matched the auditory tones, suggesting that the system for approximating non-symbolic number, even across modalities, is present in infancy. What is important to note across these three particular human studies on nonsymbolic numerosities is that it is present in infancy and develops over the lifetime. The honing of their approximation and number sense abilities as indicated by the improving Weber fractions across time, and usage of the left IPS to provide a wider berth for processing of computations and enumerations lend support for the claims that are made for a nonsymbolic number processing mechanism in human brains.

== Relations between number and other cognitive processes ==
There is evidence that numerical cognition is intimately related to other aspects of thought – particularly spatial cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hubbard | first=Edward M.|author2=Piazza, Manuela |author3=Pinel, Philippe |author4= Dehaene, Stanislas  | title=Interactions between number and space in parietal cortex | journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience | date=June 2005  | volume=6 | issue=1–2 | pages=435–448|doi=10.1038/nrn1684 | url=http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v6/n6/full/nrn1684.html | pmid=15928716}}&lt;/ref&gt; One line of evidence comes from studies performed on number-form [[Synaesthesia|synaesthetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Galton | first=Francis | title=Visualised Numerals | journal=Nature | date=25 March 1880 | volume=21 | pages=494–495|doi=10.1038/021494e0 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v21/n543/abs/021494e0.html | issue=543}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such individuals report that numbers are mentally represented with a particular spatial layout; others experience numbers as perceivable objects that can be visually manipulated to facilitate calculation. Behavioral studies further reinforce the connection between numerical and spatial cognition. For instance, participants respond quicker to larger numbers if they are responding on the right side of space, and quicker to smaller numbers when on the left—the so-called "Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes" or [[Spatial-numerical association of response codes|SNARC effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dehaene | first=Stanislas|author2=Bossini, Serge |author3=Giraux, Pascal  | title=The mental representation of parity and number magnitude | journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology | date=September 1993  | volume=122 | pages=371–396|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.122.3.371 | url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xge/122/3/371/ | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect varies across culture and context,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fischer | first=Martin H.|author2=Mills, Richard A. |author3=Shaki, Samuel  | title=How to cook a SNARC: Number placement in text rapidly changes spatial–numerical associations | journal=Brain and Cognition | date=April 2010  | volume=72 | issue=3 | pages=333–336|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2009.10.010 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WBY-4XPBSNT-1&amp;_user=4429&amp;_coverDate=04%2F30%2F2010&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=gateway&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1750488780&amp;_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&amp;_acct=C000059602&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=4429&amp;md5=2c807ea3dafb118b016973bfee5441f6&amp;searchtype=a|accessdate=14 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, and some research has even begun to question whether the SNARC reflects an inherent number-space association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Núñez | first=Rafael|author2=Doan, D. |author3=Nikoulina, A.  | title=Squeezing, striking, and vocalizing: Is number representation fundamentally spatial? | journal=Cognition | date=August 2011 | pmid=21640338|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2011.05.001 | volume=120 | issue=2 | pages=225–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead invoking strategic problem solving or a more general cognitive mechanism like [[conceptual metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Walsh | first=Vincent | title=A theory of magnitude: common cortical metrics of time, space and quantity | journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences | date=November 2003  | volume=7 | issue=11 | pages=483–488|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2003.09.002 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VH9-49JHRY2-1&amp;_user=9044837&amp;_coverDate=11%2F30%2F2003&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=gateway&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000059602&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=9044837&amp;md5=8621b8ecd2a24915cdcf9294cda7783c&amp;searchtype=a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nunez | first=Rafael | title=Numbers and Arithmetic: Neither Hardwired Nor Out There | journal=Biological Theory | year=2009 | volume=4 | issue = 1  | pages=68–83 | doi=10.1162/biot.2009.4.1.68 | url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/biot.2009.4.1.68|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, neuroimaging studies reveal that the association between number and space also shows up in brain activity.

Modification of the usual [[decimal representation]] was advocated by [[John Colson]]. The sense of [[complement (set theory)|complementation]], missing in the usual decimal system, is expressed by [[signed-digit representation]].

==Ethnolinguistic variance==

The numeracy of indigenous peoples is studied to identify universal aspects of numerical cognition in humans. Notable examples include the [[Pirahã people]] who have no words for specific numbers and the [[Munduruku people]] who only have number words up to five. Pirahã adults are unable to mark an exact number of tallies for a pile of nuts containing fewer than ten items. Anthropologist [[Napoleon Chagnon]] spent several decades studying the [[Yanomami]] in the field. He concluded that they have no need for counting in their everyday lives. Their hunters keep track of individual arrows with the same mental faculties that they use to recognize their family members. There are no known hunter-gatherer cultures that have a counting system in their language. The mental and lingual capabilities for numeracy are tied to the development of agriculture and with it large numbers of indistinguishable items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window Into Human Nature |first=Steven |last=Pinker |authorlink=Steven Pinker |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location= |year=2008 |isbn=0143114247 |pages= |page= |accessdate=November 8, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCDX54DlYBYC&amp;q=counting+system}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5346">{{about|a set of anthologies benefitting Oxfam|the Japanese animated TV series|Ox Tales (anime)}}
'''Ox-Tales''' refers to four anthologies of short stories written by 38 of the UK's best known authors. All the authors donated their stories to [[Oxfam]]. The books and stories are loosely based on the four elements ('''Earth''', '''Fire''', '''Air''' and '''Water''')

The '''Ox-Tales''' books were published in partnership with Green Profile&lt;ref&gt;[http://irisonbooks.com/2010/11/10/green-books-campaign-ox-tales-earth/ "Green Books Campaign: Ox-Tales Earth"], Iris on Books, 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GreenProfile&gt;[http://www.profilebooks.com/catalogue.php?catalogue_id=4 Green Profile]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517043111/http://www.profilebooks.com/catalogue.php?catalogue_id=4 |date=May 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to raise revenue to fund [[Oxfam]]'s projects which fight [[poverty]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org.uk/ Oxfam GB]&lt;/ref&gt; Oxfam receives a percentage of the cover price of each book sold (£3.50 per book if bought directly from an Oxfam shop or Oxfam's online store&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org.uk/shop/content/books/default.html Oxfam's Online Store]&lt;/ref&gt; and 50p if the books are purchased through other retailers).

==Themes==
The themes of the collections are intended to represent four aspects of [[Oxfam]]'s work:

* '''Earth''' — land rights and farming&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org.uk/resources/learning/landrights/index.html Oxfam GB: Land Rights in Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Air''' — combating climate change&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org.uk/get_involved/campaign/climate_change/index-6.html Oxfam GB: Combatting Climate Change]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Fire''' — campaigning for arms control&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org.uk/get_involved/campaign/control_arms/index.html Oxfam GB: Campaigning for Arms Control]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Water''' — safe water and sanitation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org.uk/oxfam_in_action/emergencies/whatwedo/watsan.html Oxfam GB: Water and Sanitation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each book contains a poem by [[Vikram Seth]] and an afterword written by Oxfam, detailing their work in that area.

==Publication details==
Ox-Tales were published by Green Profile&lt;ref name=GreenProfile /&gt; (a section of [[Profile Books]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profilebooks.com Profile Books]&lt;/ref&gt;) on 2 July 2009. They were originally published to mark the start of Oxfam's first annual book festival - "Bookfest"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org.uk/shop/content/books/bookfest.html Oxfam GB: Bookfest]&lt;/ref&gt; (4–18 July 2009).

==Reception==
In Autumn 2009, the [[National Association for the Teaching of English]] (NATE) recommended Ox-Tales to its readers as "enjoyable, thought-provoking reading for you and also for older students — well worth a place in the secondary school stock cupboard for KS4 of KS5."&lt;ref name=Blog&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org.uk/applications/blogs/books/?p=2641 Talking Books — Oxfam's Books Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

NATE reprinted [[Marina Lewycka]]'s story "The Importance of Having Warm Feet" from the ''Ox-Tales: Earth'' collection in the October 2009 edition of their magazine, ''Classroom''.&lt;ref name=Blog /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nate.org.uk/index.php?page=10&amp;id=26 ''Classroom'' magazine], Issue #9, October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Politeness theory''' accounts for the redressing of affronts to a person's '[[Face (self image)|face]]' by face-threatening acts.&lt;ref name="Foley" /&gt;  The concept of face was derived from Chinese into English in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hinze|first=Carl G.|year=2012|title=Chinese politeness is not about 'face'|journal=Journal of Politeness Research|volume=8|pages=11–27|doi=10.1515/pr-2012-0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Erving Goffman]] would then go on to introduce the concept into academia through his theories of 'face' and '[[Face (sociological concept)#Communication theory|facework]]'.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Although [[politeness]] has been studied in a variety of cultures for many years, [[Penelope Brown]] and [[Stephen C. Levinson|Stephen Levinson]]'s politeness theory has become very influential.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politeness in Language: Studies in its History, Theory and Practice|last=Watts|first=Richard J.|last2=Ide|first2=Sachiko|last3=Ehlich|first3=Konrad|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2005|isbn=978-3-11-019981-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Brown and Levinson proposed that politeness was a [[Cultural universal|universal]] concept,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armaşu|first=Veronica-Diana|date=2012|title=Modern Approaches to Politeness Theory. A Cultural Context.|journal=Lingua. Language and Culture|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has had some disagreement within academia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mills, Sara. 2003. Gender and Politeness. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language and Gender|last=Eckert|first=Penelope|last2=McConnell-Ginet|first2=Sally|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-107-02905-7|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politeness is the expression of the speakers' intention to mitigate face threats carried by certain face threatening acts toward the listener.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another definition is "a battery of social skills whose goal is to ensure everyone feels affirmed in a social interaction".&lt;ref name="Foley" /&gt; Therefore, being polite can be an attempt for the speaker to save their own face or the face of who he or she is talking to.

== Positive and negative face ==
[[Face (self image)|Face]] is the public [[self-image]] that every person tries to protect. Brown and Levinson defined positive face two ways: as "the want of every member that his wants be desirable to at least some others executors" (p.&amp;nbsp;62), or alternatively, "the positive consistent self-image or '[[Personality type|personality]]' (crucially including the [[desire (emotion)|desire]] that this self-image be appreciated and approved of) claimed by interactants" (p.&amp;nbsp;61).&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt;  Negative face was defined as "the want of every 'competent adult member' that his actions be unimpeded by others", or "the basic claim to territories, personal preserves, [[right]]s to non-distraction—i.e. the [[liberty|freedom]] of action and freedom from imposition".&lt;ref name="BandL"&gt;Brown, Penelope and Stephen C. Levinson. 1987. Politeness: Some universals in language usage. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.  {{ISBN|978-0-521-31355-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas positive face involves a desire for connection with others, negative face needs include autonomy and independence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ten years later, Brown characterized positive face by desires to be liked, admired, ratified, and related to positively, noting that one would threaten positive face by ignoring someone.  At the same time, she characterized negative face by the desire not to be imposed upon, noting that negative face could be impinged upon by imposing on someone.&lt;ref&gt;Coates, Jennifer. 1998. Language and Gender: A Reader. Wiley-Blackwell.  {{ISBN|978-0-631-19595-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive face refers to one's [[self-esteem]], while negative face refers to one's freedom to act.&lt;ref name="Foley"&gt;Foley, William. 1997. Anthropological Linguistics: An introduction. Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0-631-15122-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These two aspects of face are the basic wants in any [[social interaction]]; during any social interaction, [[cooperation]] is needed amongst the [[wikt:participation|participants]] to maintain each other's face.&lt;ref name="Foley" /&gt; Participants can do this by using positive politeness and negative politeness, which pay attention to people's positive and negative face needs respectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Face-threatening acts ==
According to Brown and Levinson, positive and negative face exist universally in human [[culture]]; it has been argued that the notion of face is the actual universal component to their proposed politeness theory.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;   A face threatening act is an act that inherently damages the face of the [[addressee]] or the speaker by acting in opposition to the wants and desires of the other. Face threatening acts can be verbal (using words/language), paraverbal (conveyed in the characteristics of speech such as [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[inflection]], etc.), or non-verbal (facial expression, etc.). Based on the terms of conversation in social interactions, face-threatening acts are at times inevitable. At minimum, there must be at least one of the face threatening acts associated with an [[utterance]]. It is also possible to have multiple acts working within a single utterance.&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt;

=== Negative face-threatening acts ===
Negative face is threatened when an individual does not avoid or intend to avoid the obstruction of their [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor's]] freedom of action.&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt; It can cause damage to either the speaker or the hearer, and makes one of the interlocutors submit their will to the other. Freedom of choice and action are impeded when negative face is threatened.

==== Damage to the hearer ====
:The following are cases in which the negative face of the hearer (the person being spoken to) is threatened.
:*An act that affirms or denies a future act of the hearer creates pressure on the hearer to either perform or not perform the act.&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt;
:::''Examples: orders, requests, suggestions, advice, remindings, threats, or warnings.''
:*An act that expresses the speaker's sentiments of the hearer or the hearer's belongings.&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt;
:::''Examples: compliments, expressions of envy or admiration, or expressions of strong negative emotion toward the hearer (e.g. hatred, anger, distrust).''
:*An act that expresses some positive future act of the speaker toward the hearer. In doing so, pressure has been put on the hearer to accept or reject the act and possibly incur a debt.&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt;
:::''Examples: offers and promises.''

==== Damage to the speaker ====

:The following are cases in which the negative face of the speaker (the person talking) is threatened.
:*An act that shows that the speaker is succumbing to the power of the hearer.&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt;
::*Expressing thanks
::*Accepting a thank you or apology
::*Excuses
::*Acceptance of offers
::*A response to the hearer's violation of social etiquette
::*The speaker commits himself to something he or she does not want to do

=== Positive face-threatening acts ===
Positive face is threatened when the speaker or hearer does not care about their interactor's feelings, wants, or does not want what the other wants.&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt; Positive face threatening acts can also cause damage to the speaker or the hearer. When an individual is forced to be separated from others so that their well being is treated less importantly, positive face is threatened.

==== Damage to the hearer ====
:The following are cases in which the positive face of the hearer (the person being spoken to) is threatened.
:*An act that expresses the speaker's negative assessment of the hearer's positive face or an element of his/her positive face. The speaker can display this disapproval in two ways. The first approach is for the speaker to directly or indirectly indicate that he dislikes some aspect of the hearer's possessions, desires, or personal attributes. The second approach is for the speaker to express disapproval by stating or implying that the hearer is wrong, irrational, or misguided.&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt;
:::''Examples: expressions of disapproval (e.g. insults, accusations, complaints), contradictions, disagreements, or challenges.''
:*An act that expresses the speaker's indifference toward the addressee's positive face.&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt;
::*The addressee might be embarrassed for or fear the speaker.
:::''Examples: excessively emotional expressions.''
::*The speaker indicates that he doesn't have the same values or fears as the hearer
:::''Examples: disrespect, mention of topics which are inappropriate in general or in the context.''
::*The speaker indicates that he is willing to disregard the emotional well being of the hearer.
:::''Examples: belittling or boasting.''
::*The speaker increases the possibility that a face-threatening act will occur. This situation is created when a topic is brought up by the speaker that is a sensitive societal subject.
:::''Examples: topics that relate to politics, race, religion.''
::*The speaker indicates that he is indifferent to the positive face wants of the hearer. This is most often expressed in obvious non-cooperative behavior.
:::''Examples: interrupting, non sequiturs.''
::*The speaker misidentifies the hearer in an offensive or embarrassing way. This may occur either accidentally or intentionally. Generally, this refers to the misuse of address terms in relation to status, gender, or age.
:::''Example: Addressing a young woman as "ma'am" instead of "miss."''

==== Damage to the speaker ====
:The following are cases in which the positive face of the speaker (the person talking) is threatened.
:*An act that shows that the speaker is in some sense wrong, and unable to control himself.&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt;
::*Apologies: In this act, speaker is damaging his own face by admitting that he regrets one of his previous acts.
::*Acceptance of a compliment
::*Inability to control one's [[physical body|physical]] self
::*Inability to control one's [[emotional]] self
::*Self-humiliation
::*Confessions

===How refusals threaten positive and negative face ===
In their study of refusals to requests, Johnson et al. argue refusals can threaten both the positive and negative face of the refuser (the person who was asked a favor), and the positive face of the requester (the person asking for a favor). Obstacles, or reasons for non-compliance with a person's request, can "vary on three dimensions: willingness-unwillingness, ability-inability, and focus on-focus away from the requester".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
&lt;!-- is it possible the three dimensions more? It's a little confusing. ~~~~ --&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The willingness dimension differentiates between refusals where the refuser states, "I don't want to help you" and "I'd like to help." Ability differentiates between, "I'm short on cash" and "I have some extra money." Focus on-focus away from requester differentiates between, "It's your problem, so you take care of it" and "It's terrible that your mom won't give you the money."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;When a person makes a request, their positive face is threatened mostly along the ability and unwillingness dimensions. People tend to make requests of "intimates," people they are supposed to know well/have a good relationship with. Threat to the requester's positive face increases when the requester chooses a person who has low ability/inability to fulfill the request or is unwilling to comply (the person being asked has to refuse the request); choosing a person with low ability suggests the requester has poor relational knowledge.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; On the other hand, choosing a person with high ability decreases threat to the requester's positive face because it shows the requester's competence; choosing a person with high willingness reinforces the requester's choice and decreases threats to positive face.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Choosing to refuse or not refuse a request can threaten the requester's positive and negative faces in different ways. When a person refuses to comply with a request from an intimate, they are violating relational expectations and increasing threat to their positive face; however, focusing attention away from the requester can decrease threat to the requester's positive face even if they are unwilling to help.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In contrast, focusing attention on the requester can increase threat to positive face since it highlights the requester's unwillingness. Accepting a request is the least threatening act.

Threats to the refuser's negative face vary along the ability and focus dimensions. Focusing away from the requester allows the refuser to maintain their autonomy while maintaining the relationship; this leads to less face-threat if the refuser has high ability because they can choose whether to comply or not.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Focusing on the requester would threaten their relationship with the requester and their long-term autonomy (the requester may be unwilling to comply to future requests when the roles are reversed); however, if the refuser has low ability, focusing on the requester can actually decrease threats to negative face by showing they are unable to comply even if they wanted to.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Note: the requester and refuser would be analogous to the "speaker" and "hearer" roles discussed earlier in the section "Face-threatening acts".

== Politeness strategies ==
Politeness strategies are used to formulate messages in order to save the hearer's positive face when face-threatening acts are inevitable or desired.  Brown and Levinson outline four main types of politeness strategies: bald on-record, negative politeness, positive politeness, and off-record (indirect) as well as simply not using the face-threatening act.

=== Bald on-record ===
Bald on-record strategy does not attempt to minimize the threat to the hearer's face, although there are ways that bald on-record politeness can be used in trying to minimize face-threatening acts implicitly, such as giving advice in a non-manipulative way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldsmith|first=Daena J.|date=April 2000|title=The Impact of Politeness and Relationship on Perceived Quality of Advice About a Problem|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2958.2000.tb00757.x/abstract|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=26|issue=26.2|pages=234–263|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2000.tb00757.x|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often using such a strategy will shock or embarrass the addressee, and so this strategy is most often utilized in situations where the speaker has a close relationship with the listener, such as family or close friends. Brown and Levinson outline various cases in which one might use the bald on-record strategy, including:&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt;
:*Situations with no threat minimization
::*Urgency or desperation
:::''Watch out!''
::*When efficiency is necessary
:::''Hear me out:...''
::*Task-oriented
:::''Pass me the hammer.''
::*Little or no desire to maintain someone's face
:::''Don't forget to clean the blinds!''
::*Doing the face-threatening act is in the interest of the hearer
:::''Your headlights are on!''
:*Situations where the threat is minimized implicitly
::*Welcomes
:::''Come in.''
::*Offers
:::''Leave it, I'll clean up later.''
:::''Eat!''

=== Positive politeness ===
Positive politeness strategies seek to minimize the threat to the hearer's positive face.  These strategies are used to make the hearer feel good about themselves, their interests or possessions, and are most usually used in situations where the audience knows each other fairly well.&lt;ref name="Foley" /&gt;  In addition to hedging and attempts to avoid conflict, some strategies of positive politeness include statements of friendship, solidarity, compliments, and the following examples from Brown and Levinson:&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt;
* Attend to H's interests, needs, wants
::''You look sad.  Can I do anything?''
* Use solidarity in-group identity markers
::''Heh, mate, can you lend me a dollar?''
::''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Güey, ¿me haces un paro?'*''  
::*Translation:  "Do a favor for me?"  "[[Güey]]" can be an in-group solidarity marker, usually associated with certain regions of [[Mexico]]; literally meaning 'ox', it can be used to belittle someone and/or their intelligence.  Therefore, you could only use it with friends without running the risk of a confrontation.  To use it in-group, however, is an indication of friendship/solidarity, depending on intonation.
* Be optimistic
::''I'll just come along, if you don't mind.''
* Include both speaker (S) and hearer (H) in activity
::''If we help each other, I guess, we'll both sink or swim in this course.''
* Offer or promise
::''If you wash the dishes, I'll vacuum the floor.''
* Exaggerate interest in H and his interests
::''That's a nice haircut you got; where did you get it?''
* Avoid Disagreement
::''Yes, it's rather long; not short certainly.''
* Joke
::''Wow, that's a whopper!''

Positive politeness strategies can also emerge in situations where the speakers do not know each other well. For example, Charlotte Rees and Lynn Knight&lt;ref name="Rees and Charlotte"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rees|first1=Charlotte|last2=Knight|first2=Lynn|title=Thinking 'no' but Saying 'yes' to Student Presence in General Practice Consultations: Politeness Theory Insights|journal=Medical Education|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; have explored the role politeness theory plays in general practice consultations.&lt;ref name="Rees and Charlotte" /&gt; They found that, in an effort to remain polite, patients agreed to the presence of a student observer during a general practice consultation even when the patient preferred a private consultation. Rees and Knight concluded that politeness strategies in the medical field can inhibit patients from providing complete and accurate information.

Another use of positive politeness is polite or formal speech such as [[Honorific speech in Japanese|Japanese honorifics]]. Again, this type of formal speech can be used to protect the hearer's positive face.

=== Negative politeness ===
Negative politeness strategies are oriented towards the hearer's negative face and emphasize avoidance of imposition on the hearer. By attempting to avoid imposition from the speaker, the risk of face-threat to the hearer is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maha|first=Lounis|date=2014|title=Cross-Cultural Perspectives on Linguistic Politeness|url=|journal=CSCanada|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies presume that the speaker will be imposing on the listener. Additionally, there is a higher potential for awkwardness or embarrassment than in bald on record strategies and positive politeness strategies.  Negative face is the desire to remain autonomous so the speaker is more apt to include an out for the listener through distancing styles like apologies or indirect speech.&lt;ref name="Foley" /&gt;  The use of negative politeness strategies assume a direct relationship between indirectness and politeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogiermann|first=Eva|date=2009|title=Politeness and In-directness across Cultures: A Comparison of English, German, Polish and Russian Requests|url=|journal=Journal of Politeness Research|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples from Brown and Levinson include:&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt;
* Be indirect
::''Would you know where Oxford Street is?''
* Use hedges or questions
::''Perhaps, he might have taken it, maybe.''
::''Could you please pass the rice?''
* Be pessimistic
::''You couldn't find your way to lending me a thousand dollars, could you?''
::''So I suppose some help is out of the question, then?''
* Minimize the imposition
::''It's not too much out of your way, just a couple of blocks.''
* Use obviating structures, like nominalizations, passives, or statements of general rules
::''I hope offense will not be taken.''
::''Visitors sign the ledger.''
::''Spitting will not be tolerated.''
* Apologetic
::''I'm sorry; it's a lot to ask, but can you lend me a thousand dollars?''
* Use plural pronouns
::''We regret to inform you.''

Favor seeking, or a speaker asking the hearer for a favor, is a common example of negative politeness strategies in use.  Held observes three main stages in favor-seeking: the preparatory phase, the focal phase, and the final phase:&lt;ref name="CandM"&gt;Carter, Ronald and McCarthy, Michael. 1994. Language as Discourse- Perspectives for Language Teaching. Longman Publishing, New York. {{ISBN|0-582-08424-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The preparatory phase is when the favor-seeking is preceded by elaborate precautions against loss of face to both sides. It often involves signals of openings and markers to be used to clarify the situation (e.g. 'You see,' or 'so,'). The request is often softened, made less direct, and imposing (e.g. past continuous 'I was wondering'; informal tag 'What d'you reckon?). The speaker must also reduce his own self-importance in the matter and exaggerate the hearer's (down-scaling compliments).
# The focal stage is subdivided into elements such as asker's reasons or constraints (e.g. 'I've tried everywhere but can't get one'), the other's face (e.g. 'You're the only person I can turn to'), and more.
# The third stage is the final stage which consists of anticipatory thanks, promises, and compliments (e.g. 'I knew you would say yes. You're an angel.').
McCarthy and Carter&lt;ref name="CandM" /&gt; provide an example of negative politeness using the following dialogue from the Australian television soap opera, "[[Neighbours]]":
:Clarrie: So I said to him, forget your books for one night, throw a party next weekend.
:Helen: A party at number 30! What will Dorothy say about ''that''?
:Clarrie: Well, what she doesn't know won't hurt her. Of course, I'll be keeping my eye on things, and (SIGNAL OF OPENING) that brings me to my next problem. (EXPLAIN PROBLEM) You see, these young people, they don't want an old codger like me poking my nose in, so I'll make myself scarce, but I still need to be closer to hand, you see. So, (ASK FAVOR) I was wondering, would it be all right if I came over here on the night? What d'you reckon?
:Helen: Oh, Clarrie, I...
:Clarrie: Oh (MINIMIZATION) I'd be no bother. (REINFORCE EXPLANATION) It'd mean a heck of a lot to those kids.
:Helen: All right.
:Clarrie: (THANK WITH BOOST) I knew you'd say yes. You're an angel, Helen.
:Helen: Ha! (laughs)

All of this is done in attempt to avoid imposition on the hearer. Negative politeness is concerned with proceeding towards a goal in the smoothest way and with sensitivity to one's interlocutors.  In English, deference ('Excuse me, sir, could you please close the window') is associated with the avoidance or downplaying of an imposition; the more we feel we might be imposing, the more deferential we might be.&lt;ref name="Foley" /&gt; It is clearly a strategy for negative politeness and the redressing of a threat to negative face, through actions such as favor-seeking.

=== Off-record (indirect) ===
The final politeness strategy outlined by Brown and Levinson is the indirect strategy; This strategy uses indirect language and removes the speaker from the potential to be imposing. For example, a speaker using the indirect strategy might merely say "wow, it's getting cold in here" insinuating that it would be nice if the listener would get up and turn up the thermostat without directly asking the listener to do so.  This strategy relies heavily on [[pragmatics]] to convey the intended meaning while still utilizing the [[Semantics|semantic]] meaning as a way to avoid losing face (see below in [[#Choice of strategy|Choice of strategy]]).

== Choice of strategy ==

[[Paul Grice]] argues that all conversationalists are rational beings who are primarily interested in the efficient conveying of messages.&lt;ref&gt;1975. "Logic and conversation". In Cole, P. and Morgan, J. (eds.) Syntax and semantics, vol 3. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown and Levinson use this argument in their politeness theory by saying that rational agents will choose the same politeness strategy as any other would under the same circumstances to try to mitigate face. They show the available range of verbal politeness strategies to redress loss of face. Face-threatening acts have the ability to mutually threaten face, therefore rational agents seek to avoid face-threatening acts or will try to use certain strategies to minimize the threat.  It should be noted that in certain situations, an over application of any particular strategy may actually achieve the opposite of the intended effect, as "certain speakers consistently evaluate polite behavior as unnecessary and offensive."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Speaker (S) will weigh:&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt;
# the want to communicate the content of the face-threatening act in question
# the want to be efficient or urgent
# the want to maintain H's face to any degree
In most cooperative circumstances where 3. is greater than 2., S will want to minimize the face-threatening act.

The greater potential for loss of face requires greater redressive action.  If the potential for loss of face is too great, the speaker may make the decision to abandon the face-threatening acts completely and say nothing.

The number next to each strategy corresponds to the danger-level of the particular face-threatening act.  The more dangerous the particular face-threatening act is, the more S will tend to use a higher numbered strategy.&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt;

# No redressive action
#: *Bald On-Record- leaves no way for H to minimize the face-threatening act.
# Positive redressive action
#: *S satisfies a wide range of H's desires not necessarily related to the face-threatening act.
#: **Shows interest in H
#: **Claims common ground with H
#: **Seeks agreement
#: **Gives sympathy
# Negative redressive action
#: *S satisfies H's desires to be unimpeded—the want that is directly challenged by the face-threatening act.
#: **Be conventionally indirect
#: **Minimize imposition on H
#: **Beg forgiveness
#: **Give deference
#: *This implies that the matter is important enough for S to disturb H
# Off-Record
#: *S has the opportunity to evade responsibility by claiming that H's interpretation of the utterance as a face-threatening act is wrong
# Don't do the face-threatening act.

=== Payoffs associated with each strategy ===

In deciding which strategy to use, the speaker runs through the individual payoffs of each strategy.&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt;
* Bald on-record
::*enlists public pressure, puts H in the public eye if there are others present
::*S gets credit for honesty, outspokenness which avoids the danger of seeming manipulative, yet can come across as abrasive and tactless
::*S avoids danger of being misunderstood by putting intended meaning directly into utterance without the reliance upon the [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] meaning
* Positive politeness
::*minimizes threatening aspect by assuring that S considers to be of the same kind with H, increasing the sense of solidarity and decreasing their social distance
:::*criticism may lose much of its sting if done in a way that asserts mutual friendship
::*when S includes themself equally as a participant in the request or offer, it may lessen the potential for face-threatening act debt
:::*Ex:  a person says "Let's get on with dinner"  to their spouse in front of the television: by using the first person plural of the imperative form of the verb, the speaker is able to include themself as a recipient of the order, just like the hearer, likewise increasing solidarity.
* Negative politeness
::*Helps avoid future debt by keeping social distance and not getting too familiar with H
::*pays respect or deference by assuming that you may be intruding on the hearer in return for the face-threatening act.
:::*Ex:  "I don't mean to bother you, but can I ask a quick question?"
* Off record
::*get credit for being tactful, non-coercive
::*avoid responsibility for the potentially face-damaging interpretation
::*give the addressee an opportunity to seem to care for S because it tests H's feelings towards S
:::*If S wants H to close the window, he may say "It's cold in here." If H answers "I'll go close the window" then he is responding to this potentially threatening act by giving a "gift" to the original speaker and therefore S avoids the potential threat of ordering H around and H gets credit for being generous or cooperative
* Don't do the face-threatening act.
::*S avoids offending H at all
::*S also fails to achieve his desired communication
::*An example might be a physician avoiding bringing up the need for a patient to lose weight.

== Analysis of Brown and Levinson's politeness theory ==

=== Critiques ===
Although Brown and Levinson's theory is widely applicable, some weaknesses in their theory have been noted:
# Cross-Cultural Validity: Although everyone has face wants, there are different ways strategies they use to accomplish these wants or mitigate face threats based on their culture.&lt;ref name="Mao 1993"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mao|first=LuMing Robert|date=1993|title=Beyond Politeness Theory: 'Face' Revisited and Renewed|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378216694900256|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|issue=21.5|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(94)90025-6|pmid=|access-date=|volume=21|pages=451–486}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of this intracultural difference is, in part, due to diverse "knowledge and values" within a particular society,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Explaining Communication: Contemporary Theories and Exemplars|last=Goldsmith|first=Daena J.|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8058-3959-3|editor-last=Samter|editor-first=Wendy|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=219–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Brown and Levinson argue that their theory is universal.  Many academics have critiqued that many cultures use politeness strategies differently than how Brown and Levinson theorized.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, negative politeness is the norm in some cultures (Japan and Britain) but not others that prefer positive politeness (Australia)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and some cultures use politeness strategies when there is no face threat, such as the [[Japanese honorifics|Japanese honorific]] system.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Ide et al. shows that the roughly equivalent term in Japanese, ''teneina'', has different sets of connotations associated with it from the English term "politeness".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  (See Cultural Differences)
# The Four Politeness Strategies Are Not Mutually Exclusive: Some claim that a few of these techniques may be used in more than one type of situation or more than one at a time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, a given [[speech act]] (of any politeness strategy) can have multiple consequences, rather than affecting only positive face or negative face as the current theory suggests.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ifert Johnson|first=Danette|last2=Roloff|first2=Michael E.|last3=Riffee|first3=Melissa A.|date=Summer 2004|title=Politeness theory and refusals of requests: Face threat as a function of expressed obstacles|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10510970409388616?needAccess=true|journal=Communication Studies|volume=55|issue=2|pages=227–238|doi=10.1080/10510970409388616|pmid=|access-date=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Nonverbal Aspects of Communication: Sometimes nonverbal actions speak louder than verbal communication and might alter how the politeness strategy is interpreted or which politeness strategy is used.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
# Sequence of the Order of Actions: The order of the conversation may dictate whether a face threat is seen more negatively, this may differ across culture context where speech styles vary and conversation styles vary considerably.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
# Individual Differences: An individual may have a pattern or way of communicating that they have habitually used in the past that others may consider face threatening or vice versa. Mood may also drive how they choose to respond to a situation regardless of politeness strategies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
# Issues with Terminology and their Definitions: various definitions of 'politeness' which make reference to considering others' feelings, establishing levels of mutual comfort, and promoting rapport have been found to be lacking, in that often whether a verbal act is face threatening or not depends upon preemptively knowing how the hearer will interpret it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  This view shifts the focus from predominantly upon the speaker to upon both speaker and hearer, implying that politeness is socially constructed and therefore not universal, requiring cross-cultural examination.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Additionally, a distinction has been made between first- and second-order politeness, due to the appropriation of an English word for a scientific concept: first-order politeness "correspond[s] to the various ways in which polite behavior is perceived and talked about by members of socio-cultural groups", meaning the connotation of 'politeness' for those not studying it, and second-order politeness is "a theoretical construct, a term within a theory of social behavior and language usage", meaning the scientific application of the term.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Additionally, Brown and Levinson do not discuss all types of speech acts in their framework of politeness, including some that are very common in discourse (such as refusals of requests).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Hierarchy politeness ====
Scholars suggest power differences vary between strangers and acquaintances, which in turn, shape the effects of the politeness strategies. Social similarity and intimacy are other aspects to consider, as these connections create an increased awareness of the other person's meaning and request and therefore minimize the face-threatening act.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1964, socio-psychologist Edward E. Jones wrote a book on ingratiation and defines it as "a class of strategic behaviors illicitly designed to influence a particular other person concerning the attractiveness of one's personal qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ingratiation: A Social Psychological Analysis|last=Jones|first=Edward E.|publisher=Irvington Publishers|year=1975|isbn=|location=New York|pages=10|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of [[ingratiation]] has helped spur further investigation into how it power dynamics play into Brown and Levinson's politeness theory.  The claim has been made that Brown and Levinson's theory does not take into account the effect unique dynamic power relations and rankings has on the way people interact with one another (i.e. ingratiation).

An article written by Akio Yabuuchi argues a case for a new trichotomous politeness system to replace politeness theory's dichotomous politeness system; hierarchy politeness&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yabuuchi|first=Akio|year=2006|title=Hierarchy politeness: What Brown and Levinson refused to see|journal=Intercultural Pragmatics|volume=3|issue=3|pages=323–351|doi=10.1515/ip.2006.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposed system is made up of fellowship politeness (similar to Brown and Levinson's positive politeness), autonomy politeness (similar to Brown and Levinson's negative politeness), and hierarchy politeness.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  Hierarchy politeness recognizes ingratiation as a way to communicate within power dynamics.

==== Cultural differences ====
As discussed in the first shortcoming of politeness theory, academia's main critique of Brown and Levinson's theory is their claim of universality.  Many sociologists criticize that politeness theory is heavily based on Western cultures where individualism is highly valued compared to many non-Western cultures where group identity is valued over the individual.&lt;ref name="Mao 1993" /&gt;  One example of this is the [[Japanese honorifics|Japanese honorific]] system which is used in even non face threatening circumstances, which goes against the theory that the politeness strategies are used to mitigate face threats.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fukada|first=Atsushi|date=2002|title=Universal Politeness Theory: Application to the Use of Japanese Honorifics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216603001735|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|issue=36.11|doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2003.11.006|pmid=|access-date=|volume=36|pages=1991–2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, defendants of Brown and Levinson's theory reason that people have been socialized so that the absence of these forms would be considered a face threat, qualifying these forms as mitigating a face threatening act.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

===== Politeness in Israeli society =====
In a series of interviews conducted by Blum-Kulka, House and Kasper in 1989 of fifty-two Israeli families representing a wide spectrum of Israeli society, varying in terms of parents' ages (from early twenties to late fifties), socio-economic status (lower to upper middle class) and degree of religious observance, definitions and descriptions of polite and impolite speech and behavior were elicited by the researchers.  They asked for verbalizations and evaluations of modes of situated speech performance, and encouraged exemplification via personal narratives.  Both ''nimus'' and ''adivut'' are translation equivalents of 'politeness' and definitions offered by the families interviewed for both terms of  "politeness" showed a positively association with tolerance, restraint, good manners, showing deference and being nice to people, but simultaneously referred to in a negative manner as something external, hypocritical, unnatural.  Their analysis concluded that systems of social politeness seem to represent culturally colored interpretations of basic notions of tact, (e.g., face concerns) as conventionalized in any given culture or even speech event type. As suggested already by the semantic definitions offered for the term "politeness" by Israelis, the constituents of "tact" and its appropriate modes of expression are very much subject to cultural interpretation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blum-Kulka, Shoshana.  "The metapragmatics of politeness in Israeli society." (n.d.):  Rpt. in Politeness in Language: Studies in Its  History, Theory, and Practice. Ed. Richard J. Watts, Sachiko Ide, and Konrad Ehlich. New York: De Gruyter Mouton, 2005. 255-280. Ebrary. Web. 16 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strengths ===
Despite some shortcomings in the theory, it cannot be argued that the politeness theory is certainly a unique area of study within the communication field; it is very applicable and helpful in guiding individuals in ways to improve their speech and actions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Two qualities in particular stand out:
# Good [[Heuristic]] Value: This theory has motivated scholars to implement more research into grasping these ideas or finding alternatives to this way of thinking.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
# Broad Scope: This theory considers factors that play a role in the field of communication such as "language, identity, relational definition ... social power, distance, and culture".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Application examples ==

=== Further research and applications  ===
Although the politeness theory originated from the curiosity of linguistics and language forming, scholars are beginning to see its other benefits: its ability to not only help with interpersonal relationships, workplace environments, and beyond.

==== Business world ====
One study by Cynthia Dunn observed a Japanese business that required etiquette training for their new employers.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunn|first=Cynthia|date=2011|title=Formal Forms or Verbal Strategies?  Politeness Theory and Japanese Business Etiquette Training|url=|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|doi=10.1013/j.pragma.2011.06.003|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers were taught the company's definition of politeness; they were expected to incorporate these beliefs into their day-to-day behavior, such as "kindness," "consideration for others," and "deference and respect".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, self-presentation was also a critical feature employers wanted their employees to improve upon. An attractive self-presentation through various nonverbals and word choice would not only reflect the individual's politeness but the corporation's as well.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This decision had very positive consequences in the workplace environment.

Through new studies there is the possibility that the politeness theory may penetrate deeper areas. For example, maybe more businesses will begin to take on these concepts and incorporate them into their discussion and conflict-resolution strategies. These could be effective in achieving long-term goals. Whatever the case may be, the politeness theory has a solid foundation in the field of communication and will certainly contribute positively to the assimilation of language and civility.

==== Art world ====
In his 1967 work, ''Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior'', [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] posits numerous times that with every remark people make, they risk maintaining their face and the face of others.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior|last=Goffman|first=Erving|publisher=Doubleday|year=1967|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politeness theory is generally applied when assessing speech acts or remarks.  However, a study conducted by Jurgita Sribaitė looked at politeness theory as it applied to written art reviews.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sriubaite|first=Jurgita|year=2014|title=Face-Saving and Face-Threatening Acts in Art Reviews|journal=Language in Different Contexts|volume=6|issue=1|pages=332–339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study focused on art reviews in Lithuania in the early and mid-1970s and analyzed the different strategies used by the art reviewers as they attempted to critique pieces of art while maintaining their face as well as the face of the artists.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  The study was able to identify face-saving acts and all four politeness strategies at work.  The author states, "Reviewers usually appear to have in mind the addressee's positive ''face'' (the desire to be liked and be approved of) as well as his negative ''face'' (the desire to be left free to act as he chooses)."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The examples given show that even the reviewers, who hold the obvious advantage over the addressees, cared to save both their face and the face of the artists.

==== Humor ====
Positive politeness strategies are used as a way of giving someone a sense of belonging and as seen in the politeness strategies section, jokes are considered a positive politeness strategy.  Therefore, joking can be a way of making someone feel as if though they belong.  However, some contemporary researchers have noted that humor is complex and not all jokes can be considered polite.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dynel|first=Marta|year=2016|title=Conceptualizing conversational humor as (im)politeness: The case of film  talk|journal=Journal of Politeness Research|volume=12|issue=1|pages=117–147|doi=10.1515/pr-2015-0023}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many instances of humor usage can negatively affect face for a number of reasons: the hearers ability to understand the joke is tested,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Explorations in the ethnography of speaking|last=Sacks|first=Harvey|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1974|isbn=|editor-last=Richard Bouman|editor-first=&amp; Joel Sherzer|location=Cambridge|pages=337–353|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the hearer may interpret verification of the willingness to hear a joke as aggressive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conversational joking: Humor in everyday talk|last=Norrick|first=Neal|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=Bloomington|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the hearer can be threatened even by non aggressive humor if it tests their ability to understand the joke or their emotions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1995|title=Humorous face-threatening acts: Humor as strategy|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=23|pages=325–339|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(94)00038-g}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Marta Dynel, in 2016, different occasions of humor used in the television show, [[House (TV series)|House]], were assessed and analyzed as polite or (im)polite.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  In reference to the conclusions of study Dynel states, "Specifically, humor may serve politeness and/or impoliteness depending on the speaker's intention and awareness of the consequences his/her utterance may carry, the hearer's recognition of the speaker's intention, as well as his/her ultimate amusement or taking offense."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;   In general, humor can provide face-saving tactics that enable solidarity, but it can also be a risky strategy to use because the speaker and the hearer must be on the same page.

==== Delivering bad news ====
When delivering bad news the speaker has a lot to consider regarding his or her own face and the face of the hearer.  In 2015, Miroslav Sirota and Marie Juanchich conducted a study on uncertainty communication with negative outcomes.  The authors suggest "First, speakers making a prediction may intend not only to inform about a probability level, but also to manage the hearer's faces or their own...Second, speakers perform face-managing intentions by altering (e.g. lessening or magnifying) the explicitly communicated probablility of a negative outcome...Thus, politeness theory posits that speakers use uncertainty quantifiers to pursue informative intentions and also to sugar-coat threatening news to manage the hearers' or their own faces."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sirota|first=Miroslav|last2=Juanchich|first2=Marie|year=2015|title=A direct and comprehensive test of two postulates of politeness theory applied to uncertainty communication|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|volume=10|issue=3|pages=232–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study conducted required people to communicate bad news to a friend regarding two scenarios.  In the first scenario the subjects had to communicate a 50% probability that their friend's new car was going to break-down, and in the second scenario the subjects communicated a 50% chance that their friend's stock were going to lose their value.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  The subjects of the study reported that "speakers intended to manage hearer's faces from threatening news or to manage their own facees from being wrong...speakers communicated an altered (in the case of our scenarios, lower) outcome probability when they intended to be tactful or cautious than when they intended to be informative."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In 2002, an [[Oncology|oncologist]] by the name of Jerome Groopman wrote an article entitled, ''Dying Words; How should doctor's deliver bad news?''.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Dying Words; How should doctor's deliver bad news?|last=Groopman|first=Jerome|date=2002|work=|access-date=|via=Newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his article he recalls one of the first experiences in which he had to tell a young woman that she has malignint terminal cancer.  He said to her, "Claire, with this disease, a remission would ordinarily last three to six months.  A person could expect to survive between one to two years."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; He found that this type of strategy (bald on-record) deeply shook the patient (negatively threatened her negative face).  He now uses different strategies and realized that with sensitive information tact must be used, but also that the patient must be aware of the true probability of negative outcome.  Many doctors, he argues, do not find that balance and tend to hedge information, "More than forty percent of oncologists withhold a prognosis from a patient if he or she does not ask for it or if the family requests that the patient not be told.  A similar number speak in [[euphemism]]s, skirting the truth."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  This statement reads similarly to the Sirota and Juanchich study; bad news is very frequently sugar-coated in attempt to save face.

=== Sociological variables ===

Three sociological factors affect the choice of politeness strategy and the seriousness of the face threatening action, social distance between speaker and listener, the power difference between the speaker and listener, and the seriousness of the face threat.&lt;ref name="BandL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leech, Geoffrey. 1983.Principles of pragmatics. London: Longman&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Social distance]] between parties ([[symmetry|symmetric relation]])
#: Distinguishes kin or friend from a stranger with whom you may have the same social status, but who is still separate because of social distance.  Different acts may be seen as face-threatening or non-face threatening depending on the social distance between speaker and listener
#: 
#: Example: We may use less elaborate positive strategies or we may choose to use positive rather than negative politeness when speaking with family rather than a stranger
# [[Power (philosophy)|Power]] relations between parties ([[asymmetry|asymmetric relation]])
#: We are inclined to speak to our social equals differently than those whose status is higher or lower than our own in a given situation.
#: 
#: Example: If a professor is working in her office and people are being very loud and disruptive in the next room, she will go over there and tell them to be quiet but the way she does it will differ depending on who it is.  If they are students she will use the bald on-record strategy to make sure there is no confusion in what she is asking, saying: "Stop talking so loud!".
#: But if they are colleagues she will claim common ground with them using the positive politeness strategy or frame an indirect request for them to stop talking, saying: "I'm working on a lecture and it's really hard to concentrate with all this noise.".
#: Additionally if they are really high status directors of the department she may end up saying nothing at all or apologize for interrupting them, refraining from the face-threatening act.
# The absolute ranking of the threat of the face-threatening act
#: Some impositions are considered more serious than others.  Highly imposing acts like requests demand more redress to mitigate their increased threat level.
#: 
#: Overall the formula for the weight of a face-threatening act is:
#: Weight = Social distance (speaker, hearer) + power difference (speaker, hearer) + rank of imposition
#:

==== Mitigated speech ====

In his book, ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'', [[Malcolm Gladwell]] wrote a chapter entitled, "The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes."  The chapter attempts to explain why so many planes that crash end up crashing from human error, and not mechanical issues.  One of the most prominent reasons, Gladwell points out, is the lack of effective communication due to the power dynamic between the captain and the first officer.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Outliers: The story of Success|last=Gladwell|first=Malcolm|publisher=Back Bay Books|year=2008|isbn=978-0-316-01793-0|location=New York|pages=177–223|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He uses numerous examples of [[flight recorder|black box]] recordings in which the first officer hints at a problem instead of addressing it outright.  He introduces the linguistic term, [[mitigated speech]], and states, "We mitigate when we're being polite, or when we're ashamed or embarrassed, or when we're being deferential to authority."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  First officers tend to use mitigated speech when addressing their captain and this has caused plane crashes in the past.

Linguists Ute Fischer and Judith Orasanu conducted a study with a group of captains and first officers.  They gave them a scenario in which they had to communicate to each other the need to change course to avoid a thunderstorm.  Overwhelmingly the captains used commands, or what Brown and Levinson would consider bald on-record politeness strategy, to communicate with their first officer.  On the other hand, the first officers only used hints, similar to what politeness theory would consider an off-record politeness strategy, to communicate with their superior, the captain.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Airlines have been taking this issue seriously and have made strides in teaching officers and first captains how to communicate with each other effectively.

{{Indo-European topics}}
'''Proto-Indo-European society''' is the hypothesized culture of the ancient speakers of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], ancestors of all modern Indo–European ethnic groups who are speakers of [[Indo-European languages]].  

Theories about the culture are based primarily on [[Historical linguistics|linguistics]] and not ethnic, social, or cultural study, as the origin of Indo–European and their [[Proto-Indo-European homeland|urheimat]] is still debated.  There is no direct evidence of the nature of a "Proto-Indo-European society", as such.  Any conclusions in this article or otherwise are only purely linguistic inferences, and not established facts.

==Scientific approaches==
Much of our modern ideas in this field involve the unsettled [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|Indo-European homeland]] debate about the precise origins of the language itself.  There are three main approaches researchers have employed in their attempts to study this culture, but all are subject to resolution of the debate and all are the subject of criticism:  
*'''[[Archeology]]''': Interpretations that are based on archaeological evidence.
*'''[[Comparative linguistics]]''': Interpretations that are based on the comparative analysis of the languages of historically known societies (see [[Trifunctional hypothesis]]).
*'''[[Linguistic reconstruction]]''': Interpretations that are based on the reconstruction and identification of words (those cited *thus on this page, with a preceding asterisk) which formed part of the vocabulary of the Proto-Indo-European language.  These are reconstructed on the basis of [[sound laws|sounds]], not meaning. Exactly what these terms may have referred to at the stage of Proto-Indo-European is therefore less certain.  The technique of inferring culture from such reconstructions is known as [[linguistic palaeontology]].

What follows in this page are interpretations based only on the assumption of the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] of Indo-European origins, and are by no means universally accepted.

==Societal structure==

Whether these people regarded themselves as a linguistic or ethnic community cannot be known, nor by which name they may have referred to themselves.

Linguistics has allowed the reliable reconstruction of a large number of words relating to kinship relations. These all agree in exhibiting a [[patriarchal]], [[patrilocal]] and [[patrilineal]] social fabric. Patrilocality is confirmed by lexical evidence, including the word *''{{PIE|h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;u̯edh}}'', "to lead (away)", being the word that denotes a male wedding a female (but not vice versa). It is also the dominant pattern in historical IE societies, and matrilocality would be unlikely in a patrilineal society.&lt;ref name="eiec"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |editor-first1=J. P. |editor-last1=Mallory |editor-first2=Douglas Q. |editor-last2=Adams |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]] |title=Residence |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1997 |page=483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inferences have been made for sacral kingship, suggesting the [[tribal chief]] at the same time assumed the role of high priest. [[Georges Dumézil]] suggested for Proto-Indo-European society a [[trifunctional hypothesis|threefold division]] of a [[cleric]]al class, a [[warrior]] class and a class of [[farmer]]s or husbandmen, on his interpretations that many historically known groups speaking Indo-European languages show such a division, but Dumézil's approach has been widely criticised.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

If there was a separate class of warriors, it probably consisted of single young men. They would have followed a separate warrior code unacceptable in the society outside their peer-group.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Traces of initiation rites in several Indo-European societies (e.g. early Slav, [[Volcae]], [[Neuri]] and their lupine ritualism) suggest that this group identified itself with wolves or dogs (see [[Berserker]], [[Werewolf]], [[Wild Hunt]]).

The people were organized in settlements ({{PIE|''*weiḱs''}}; [[Sanskrit]] ''viś'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''wieś'' "village"; [[Ancient Greek]] ''woikos'' "home"; [[Latin]] ''vicus''), probably each with its chief ({{PIE|''*h₃rēǵs''}}—Sanskrit ''rājan'', [[Latin]] ''rex'', ''reg-'', [[Gaulish]] ''-riks''). These settlements or villages were further divided in households ({{PIE|''*domos''}}; Latin ''domus'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''dom''), each headed by a patriarch ({{PIE|''*dems-potis''}}; Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|despotes}}, Sanskrit {{lang|sa-Latn|dampati}}, [[Polish language|Polish]] ''pan domu'').

==Technology==
Technologically, linguistic reconstruction suggests a culture of the [[Bronze Age]]: words for [[bronze]] can be reconstructed ({{PIE|''*h₂éyos''}}) from [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Italic languages|Italic]] and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], while no word for [[iron]] can be dated to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|proto-language]]. [[Gold]] and [[silver]] were known.

An {{PIE|''*n̥sis''}} ([[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''así'', Latin ''ensis'') was a bladed [[weapon]], originally a [[dagger]] of bronze or (in earliest times) of bone.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} An {{PIE|''*iḱmos''}}  was a [[spear]] or similar pointed weapon. Words for [[axe]] include {{PIE|''*h₂égʷsih₂''}} (Germanic, Greek, Italic) and {{PIE|''*péleḱu-''}} (Vedic Sanskrit ''paraśú'', Greek ''pélekus''); these could have been either of stone or of bronze.

The [[wheel]] ([[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/kʷékʷlos|{{PIE|''*kʷékʷlos''}}]] – Vedic Sanskrit ''cakrá'', Greek ''kúklos'', Old English ''hweol'', Serbo-Croatian ''kolo''; or {{PIE|''*róth₂eh₂''}} – Vedic Sanskrit ''rathá'', German ''Rad'', Latin ''rota'') was known, certainly for ox-drawn carts. The wheel was probably not invented by the Proto-Indo-Europeans, but the word {{PIE|''*kʷékʷlos''}} is a native derivation of the root {{PIE|''*kʷel''-}} "to turn" rather than a [[Loanword|borrowing]], suggesting that the PIE speakers' contact with the people who introduced the wheel to them was short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World |first=David W. |last=Anthony |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOG5VcYxhiEC |pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horse-drawn [[chariot]]s developed after the breakup of the proto-language, originating with the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]]s around 2000 BC.

Judging by the vocabulary, techniques of [[weaving]], plaiting, tying [[knot]]s etc. were important and well-developed and used for textile production as well as for baskets, fences, walls etc.

==Subsistence==
[[File:Tarpan.png|thumb|140px|Tarpan horse (1841 drawing)]]

Proto-Indo-European society depended on [[animal husbandry]]. People valued [[cattle]] ({{PIE|''*péḱu''}} – Vedic Sanskrit ''páśu'', Latin ''pecu-'' {{PIE|''*gʷōus''}} – Sanskrit ''go'', Latin ''bo-'') as their most important animals, measuring a man's wealth by the number of cows he owned (Latin ''pecunia'' 'money' from ''pecus''). [[Sheep]] ({{PIE|''*h₃ówis''}}) and [[goat]]s ({{PIE|''*gʰáidos''}}) were also kept, presumably by the less wealthy.  Agriculture and catching fish ({{PIE|''*písḱos''}}) also featured. {{or|date=September 2014}}

The [[domestication of the horse]] ({{PIE|''*h₁eḱuos''}} – Vedic Sanskrit ''áśvas'', Latin ''equus'', Greek ''hippos'') (see [[Tarpan]]) may have originated with these peoples: scholars sometimes invoke this as a factor contributing to their rapid expansion.

==Ritual and sacrifice==
{{main|Proto-Indo-European religion}}
They practiced a polytheistic religion centered on sacrificial rites, probably administered by a class of [[priest]]s or [[shaman]]s.

Animals were slaughtered ({{PIE|''*gʷʰn̥tós''}}) and dedicated to the gods ({{PIE|''*déiwos''}}) in the hope of winning their favour. The king as the high priest would have been the central figure in establishing favourable relations with the other world.

The [[Kurgan hypothesis]] suggests burials in [[tumulus|barrow]]s or tomb chambers. Important leaders would have been buried with their belongings, and possibly also with members of their household or wives ([[Sati (practice)|sati]]). The practice of [[human sacrifice]] is inferred from the [[Luhansk sacrificial site]].

==Names==
{{expand-section|date=January 2017}}
The use of two-word [[compound word]]s for personal [[name]]s, typically but not always ascribing some noble or heroic feat to their bearer, is so common in Indo-European languages that it seems certainly inherited.  These names are often of the class of compound words that in Sanskrit are called ''[[bahuvrihi]]'' compounds.

They are found in the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] region (''[[Dumnorix]]'': "king of the world"), in [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] (''[[Asvaghosa]]'': "tamer of horses"); in [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] (''[[Vishtaspa]]'': "possessing horses untied (for racing)"); in [[Hellenic languages|Hellenic]] (''[[Socrates]]'': "good ruler"); in [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] (''[[Vladimir (name)|Vladimir]]'': "ruler of the world"); in [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] (''[[Lady Godiva|Godgifu]]'': "gift of God"), and in [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] ([[Piyama-Radu]]: "gift of the devotee?").

[[Patronymic]]s such as ''Gustafsson'' ("son of Gustaf"), ''Rostamzadeh'' ("son of Rostam"),  ''Yusufzai'' ("son of Yusuf"), ''Hakopian'' ("son of Hakop"), and ''MacDòmhnaill'' ("son of Donald") are also frequently encountered in Indo-European languages.

==Philosophy==
Some words connected with PIE world-view:

*{{PIE|''*gʰosti-''}} concerned mutual obligations between people and between worshippers and gods, and from which ''guest'' and ''host'' are derived.
*{{PIE|''*h₁r̥-tu-''}}, {{PIE|''*h₁r̥-to-''}}, a cosmic, ethical, and social "right order of being": that which is "fitting, right, ordered"; also, "right time, ritually correct", revealing the harmony and order of the world ([[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''[[asha]]'', Vedic Sanskrit ''[[ṛta]]-'', ''[[ṛtu]]-'', Latin ''rītus'', etc. )

{{featured article}}
{{Use British English Oxford spelling|date=August 2016}}'''Radiocarbon dating''' (also referred to as '''carbon dating''' or '''carbon-14 dating''') is a method for [[Chronological dating|determining the age]] of an object containing [[organic material]] by using the properties of [[carbon-14|radiocarbon]], a radioactive [[Isotopes of carbon|isotope of carbon]].

The method was developed in the late 1940s by [[Willard Libby]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work in 1960. It is based on the fact that radiocarbon ({{chem|14|C}}) is constantly being created in the atmosphere by the interaction of [[cosmic ray]]s with atmospheric [[nitrogen]]. The resulting {{chem|14|C}} combines with atmospheric [[oxygen]] to form radioactive [[carbon dioxide]], which is incorporated into plants by [[photosynthesis]]; animals then acquire {{chem|14|C}} by eating the plants. When the animal or plant dies, it stops exchanging carbon with its environment, and from that point onwards the amount of {{chem|14|C}} it contains begins to decrease as the {{chem|14|C}} undergoes [[radioactive decay]]. Measuring the amount of {{chem|14|C}} in a sample from a dead plant or animal such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone provides information that can be used to calculate when the animal or plant died. The older a sample is, the less {{chem|14|C}} there is to be detected, and because the [[half-life]] of {{chem|14|C}} (the period of time after which half of a given sample will have decayed) is about 5,730 years, the oldest dates that can be reliably measured by this process date to around 50,000 years ago, although special preparation methods occasionally permit accurate analysis of older samples.

Research has been ongoing since the 1960s to determine what the proportion of {{chem|14|C}} in the atmosphere has been over the past fifty thousand years. The resulting data, in the form of a calibration curve, is now used to convert a given measurement of radiocarbon in a sample into an estimate of the sample's calendar age. Other corrections must be made to account for the proportion of {{chem|14|C}} in different types of organisms (fractionation), and the varying levels of {{chem|14|C}} throughout the [[biosphere]] (reservoir effects).  Additional complications come from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, and from the above-ground nuclear tests done in the 1950s and 1960s. Because the time it takes to convert biological materials to [[fossil fuels]] is substantially longer than the time it takes for its {{chem|14|C}} to decay below detectable levels, fossil fuels contain almost no {{chem|14|C}}, and as a result there was a noticeable drop in the proportion of {{chem|14|C}} in the atmosphere beginning in the late 19th century. Conversely, nuclear testing increased the amount of {{chem|14|C}} in the atmosphere, which attained a maximum in about 1965 of almost twice what it had been before the testing began.

Measurement of radiocarbon was originally done by beta-counting devices, which counted the amount of [[beta radiation]] emitted by decaying {{chem|14|C}} atoms in a sample. More recently, [[accelerator mass spectrometry]] has become the method of choice; it counts all the {{chem|14|C}} atoms in the sample and not just the few that happen to decay during the measurements; it can therefore be used with much smaller samples (as small as individual plant seeds), and gives results much more quickly. The development of radiocarbon dating has had a profound impact on [[archaeology]]. In addition to permitting more accurate dating within archaeological sites than previous methods, it allows comparison of dates of events across great distances. Histories of archaeology often refer to its impact as the "radiocarbon revolution".  Radiocarbon dating has allowed key transitions in prehistory to be dated, such as the end of the [[Younger Dryas|last ice age]], and the beginning of the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] in different regions.

== Background ==

=== History ===
In 1939, [[Martin Kamen]] and [[Samuel Ruben]] of the [[Lawrence Radiation Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley]] began experiments to determine if any of the elements common in organic matter had isotopes with half-lives long enough to be of value in biomedical research. They synthesized {{chem|14|C}} using the laboratory's cyclotron accelerator and soon discovered that the atom's [[half-life]] was far longer than had been previously thought.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed by a prediction by [[Serge A. Korff]], then employed at the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], that the interaction of [[w:neutron temperature|thermal neutrons]] with {{chem|14|N}} in the upper atmosphere would create {{chem|14|C}}.{{#tag:ref|Korff's paper actually referred to slow neutrons, a term that since Korff's time has acquired a more specific meaning, referring to a range of neutron energies that does not overlap with thermal neutrons.&lt;ref name="Korff_1949"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korff|first1=S.A. |year=1940|title=On the contribution to the ionization at sea-level produced by the neutrons in the cosmic radiation|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute |volume=230|issue=6|pages=777–779|doi=10.1016/s0016-0032(40)90838-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name="taylor269"&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acs.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/radiocarbon-dating.html|title=Radiocarbon Dating – American Chemical Society|website=American Chemical Society|accessdate=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had previously been thought that {{chem|14|C}} would be more likely to be created by [[deuteron]]s interacting with {{chem|13|C}}.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; At some time during World War II, [[Willard Libby]], who was then at Berkeley, learned of Korff's research and conceived the idea that it might be possible to use radiocarbon for dating.&lt;ref name="taylor269" /&gt;&lt;ref name="acs.org"/&gt;

In 1945, Libby moved to the [[University of Chicago]] where he began his work on radiocarbon dating. He published a paper in 1946 in which he proposed that the carbon in living matter might include {{chem|14|C}} as well as non-radioactive carbon.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;9–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Libby|first=W.F.|year=1946|title=Atmospheric helium three and radiocarbon from cosmic radiation|journal=Physical Review|volume=69|issue=11–12|pages=671–672|bibcode=1946PhRv...69..671L|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.69.671.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libby and several collaborators proceeded to experiment with [[methane]] collected from sewage works in Baltimore, and after [[Isotope enrichment|isotopically enriching]] their samples they were able to demonstrate that they contained {{chem|14|C}}. By contrast, methane created from petroleum showed no radiocarbon activity because of its age. The results were summarized in a paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1947, in which the authors commented that their results implied it would be possible to date materials containing carbon of organic origin.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson_1947"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=E.C.|last2=Libby|first2=W.F.|last3=Weinhouse|first3=S.|last4=Reid|first4=A.F.|last5=Kirshenbaum|first5=A.D.|last6=Grosse|first6=A.V.|year=1947|title=Radiocarbon from cosmic radiation|journal=Science|volume=105|issue=2765|pages=576–577|bibcode=1947Sci...105..576A|doi=10.1126/science.105.2735.576|pmid=17746224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libby and [[James R. Arnold|James Arnold]] proceeded to test the radiocarbon dating theory by analyzing samples with known ages. For example, two samples taken from the tombs of two Egyptian kings, [[Zoser]] and [[Sneferu]], independently dated to 2625 BC plus or minus 75 years, were dated by radiocarbon measurement to an average of 2800 BC plus or minus 250 years. These results were published in ''Science'' in 1949.&lt;ref name="libby49"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnold|first=J.R.|last2=Libby|first2=W.F.|year=1949|title=Age determinations by radiocarbon content: checks with samples of known age|url=http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/fomenko/libby.htm|journal=Science|volume=110|issue=2869|pages=678–680|bibcode=1949Sci...110..678A|doi=10.1126/science.110.2869.678|jstor=1677049|pmid=15407879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aitken_60-61"&gt;Aitken (1990), pp.&amp;nbsp;60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Some of Libby's original samples have since been retested, and the results, published in 2018, were generally in good agreement with Libby's original results.&lt;ref name="LJ_2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jull|first=A.J.T.|last2=Pearson|first2=C.L.|last3=Taylor|first3=R.E.|last4=Southon|first4= J.R. |last5=Santos |first5=G.M. |last6=Kohl |first6=C.P. |last7=Hajdas |first7=I. |last8=Molnar |first8=M. |last9=Baisan |first9=C. |last10=Lange |first10=T.E. |last11=Cruz |first11=R. |last12=Janovics |first12=R. |last13=Major |first13= I.|year=2018|title=Radiocarbon dating and intercomparison of some early historical radiocarbon samples|journal=Radiocarbon |volume=60|issue=2|pages=535–548|doi=10.1017/RDC.2018.18}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}  Within 11 years of their announcement, more than 20 radiocarbon dating laboratories had been set up worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c14dating.com/int.html|title=The method|website=www.c14dating.com|accessdate=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, Libby was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for this work.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;

In nature, [[carbon]] exists as two stable, nonradioactive [[isotope]]s: [[carbon-12]] ({{chem|12|C}}), and [[carbon-13]] ({{chem|13|C}}), and a radioactive isotope, [[carbon-14]] ({{chem|14|C}}), also known as "radiocarbon".  The half-life of {{chem|14|C}} (the time it takes for half of a given amount of {{chem|14|C}} to [[Radioactive decay|decay]]) is about 5,730 years, so its concentration in the atmosphere might be expected to reduce over thousands of years, but {{chem|14|C}} is constantly being produced in the lower [[stratosphere]] and upper [[troposphere]], primarily by galactic [[cosmic ray]]s, and to a lesser degree by solar cosmic rays.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://theses.gla.ac.uk/2941/1/2011russellphd.pdf|title=Marine radiocarbon reservoir effects (MRE) in archaeology: temporal and spatial changes through the Holocene within the UK coastal environment (PhD thesis)|author=Russell|first=Nicola|publisher=University of Glasgow|year=2011|isbn=|editor=|location=Glasgow, Scotland UK|pages=16|arxiv=|bibcode=|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These generate neutrons that in turn create {{chem|14|C}} when they strike [[nitrogen-14]] ({{chem|14|N}}) atoms.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt; The following [[nuclear reaction]] is the main pathway by which {{chem|14|C}} is created:
: n + {{nuclide|nitrogen|14}} → {{nuclide|carbon|14}} + p
where n represents a [[neutron]] and p represents a [[proton]].&lt;ref name="CES_476"&gt;Bianchi &amp; Canuel (2011), p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LJ_2001" /&gt;{{#tag:ref|The interaction of cosmic rays with nitrogen and oxygen below the earth's surface can also create {{chem|14|C}}, and in some circumstances (e.g. near the surface of snow accumulations, which are permeable to gases) this {{chem|14|C}} migrates into the atmosphere.  However, this pathway is estimated to be responsible for less than 0.1% of the total production of {{chem|14|C}}.&lt;ref name="LJ_2001" /&gt;|group=note}}

Once produced, the {{chem|14|C}} quickly combines with the oxygen in the atmosphere to form first carbon monoxide ({{chem|C|O}}),&lt;ref name="LJ_2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lal|first=D.|last2=Jull|first2=A.J.T.|year=2001|title=In-situ cosmogenic {{chem|14|C}}: production and examples of its unique applications in studies of terrestrial and extraterrestrial processes |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=43|issue=2|pages=731–742|doi=10.6028/jres.109.013|pmid=27366605|pmc=4853109}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately carbon dioxide ({{chem|CO|2}}).&lt;ref name=Alves2018/&gt;
:{{chem|14|C}} + {{chem|O|2}} → {{chem|14|C|O}} + O

:{{chem|14|C|O}} + OH → {{chem|14|C|O|2}} + H
Carbon dioxide produced in this way diffuses in the atmosphere, is dissolved in the ocean, and is taken up by plants via [[photosynthesis]]. Animals eat the plants, and ultimately the radiocarbon is distributed throughout the [[biosphere]]. The ratio of {{chem|14|C}} to {{chem|12|C}} is approximately 1.25 parts of {{chem|14|C}} to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; parts of {{chem|12|C}}.&lt;ref name="Aitken_56-58"&gt;Tsipenyuk (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;343.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, about 1% of the carbon atoms are of the stable isotope {{chem|13|C}}.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;

The equation for the radioactive decay of {{chem|14|C}} is:&lt;ref name="Currie_2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Currie|first=Lloyd A.|year=2004|title=The remarkable metrological history of radiocarbon dating II|journal=Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology|volume=109|issue=2|pages=185–217|doi=10.6028/jres.109.013|pmid=27366605|pmc=4853109}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{nuclide|carbon|14}} → {{nuclide|nitrogen|14}} + {{subatomic particle|electron}} + {{subatomic particle|electron antineutrino}}
By emitting a beta particle (an [[electron]], e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and an [[Antineutrino|electron antineutrino]] ({{subatomic particle|Electron antineutrino}}), one of the neutrons in the {{chem|14|C}} nucleus changes to a proton and the {{chem|14|C}} nucleus reverts to the stable (non-radioactive) isotope {{chem|14|N}}.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principles ===
During its life, a plant or animal is in equilibrium with its surroundings by exchanging carbon either with the atmosphere, or through its diet. It will therefore have the same proportion of {{chem|14|C}} as the atmosphere, or in the case of marine animals or plants, with the ocean. Once it dies, it ceases to acquire {{chem|14|C}}, but the {{chem|14|C}} within its biological material at that time will continue to decay, and so the ratio of {{chem|14|C}} to {{chem|12|C}} in its remains will gradually decrease. Because {{chem|14|C}} decays at a known rate, the proportion of radiocarbon can be used to determine how long it has been since a given sample stopped exchanging carbon&amp;nbsp;– the older the sample, the less {{chem|14|C}} will be left.&lt;ref name="Aitken_56-58" /&gt;

The equation governing the decay of a radioactive isotope is:&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;N = N_0e^{-\lambda t}\,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of atoms of the isotope in the original sample (at time ''t'' = 0, when the organism from which the sample was taken died), and ''N'' is the number of atoms left after time ''t''.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt; ''λ'' is a constant that depends on the particular isotope; for a given isotope it is equal to the reciprocal of the [[Radioactive decay#Time constant and mean-life|mean-life]]&amp;nbsp;– i.e. the average or expected time a given atom will survive before undergoing radioactive decay.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt; The mean-life, denoted by ''τ'', of {{chem|14|C}} is 8,267 years,{{#tag:ref|The half-life of {{chem|14|C}} (which determines the mean-life) was thought to be 5568 ± 30 years in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Libby (1965), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mean-life and half-life are related by the following equation:&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T_\frac{1}{2} = 0.693 \cdot \tau&lt;/math&gt;|group=note}} so the equation above can be rewritten as:&lt;ref&gt;Aitken (1990), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;t = 8267 \cdot \ln(N_0/N) \text{ years} &lt;/math&gt;
The sample is assumed to have originally had the same {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio as the ratio in the atmosphere, and since the size of the sample is known, the total number of atoms in the sample can be calculated, yielding ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the number of {{chem|14|C}} atoms in the original sample. Measurement of ''N'', the number of {{chem|14|C}} atoms currently in the sample, allows the calculation of ''t'', the age of the sample, using the equation above.&lt;ref name="Aitken_56-58" /&gt;

The half-life of a radioactive isotope (usually denoted by t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a more familiar concept than the mean-life, so although the equations above are expressed in terms of the mean-life, it is more usual to quote the value of {{chem|14|C}}'s half-life than its mean-life.  The currently accepted value for the half-life of {{chem|14|C}} is 5,730 ± 40 years.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt; This means that after 5,730 years, only half of the initial {{chem|14|C}} will remain; a quarter will remain after 11,460 years; an eighth after 17,190 years; and so on.

The above calculations make several assumptions, such as that the level of {{chem|14|C}} in the atmosphere has remained constant over time.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt; In fact, the level of {{chem|14|C}} in the atmosphere has varied significantly and as a result the values provided by the equation above have to be corrected by using data from other sources.&lt;ref name="Aitken (1990)"&gt;Aitken (1990), pp. 61–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is done by calibration curves (discussed below), which convert a measurement of {{chem|14|C}} in a sample into an estimated calendar age.  The calculations involve several steps and include an intermediate value called the "radiocarbon age", which is the age in "radiocarbon years" of the sample: an age quoted in radiocarbon years means that no calibration curve has been used − the calculations for radiocarbon years assume that the atmospheric {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio has not changed over time.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Calculating radiocarbon ages also requires the value of the half-life for {{chem|14|C}}.  In Libby's 1949 paper he used a value of 5720 ± 47 years, based on research by Engelkemeir et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engelkemeir|first=Antoinette G.|last2=Hamill|first2=W.H.|last3=Inghram|first3=Mark G.|last4=Libby|first4=W.F.|date=1949|title=The Half-Life of Radiocarbon (C&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;)|journal=Physical Review|volume=75|issue=12|pages=1825|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.75.1825|via=|bibcode=1949PhRv...75.1825E}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was remarkably close to the modern value, but shortly afterwards the accepted value was revised to 5568 ± 30 years,&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frederick Johnson|year=1951|title=Introduction|jstor=25146610|journal=Memoirs of the Society for American Archaeology|volume=|issue=8|pages=1–19|arxiv=|bibcode=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this value was in use for more than a decade.  It was revised again in the early 1960s to 5,730 ± 40 years,&lt;ref name=Godwin&gt;{{ cite journal

Radiocarbon ages are still calculated using this half-life, and are known as "Conventional Radiocarbon Age". Since the calibration curve (IntCal) also reports past atmospheric {{chem|14|C}} concentration using this conventional age, any conventional ages calibrated against the IntCal curve will produce a correct calibrated age.  When a date is quoted, the reader should be aware that if it is an uncalibrated date (a term used for dates given in radiocarbon years) it may differ substantially from the best estimate of the actual calendar date, both because it uses the wrong value for the half-life of {{chem|14|C}}, and because no correction (calibration) has been applied for the historical variation of {{chem|14|C}} in the atmosphere over time.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Aitken (1990), pp. 92–95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bowman (1995), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="INTCAL13"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The term "conventional radiocarbon age" is also used.

=== Carbon exchange reservoir ===
[[File:Carbon exchange reservoir 2.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.8|Simplified version of the carbon exchange reservoir, showing proportions of carbon and relative activity of the {{chem|14|C}} in each reservoir&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;{{#tag:ref|The data on carbon percentages in each part of the reservoir is drawn from an estimate of reservoir carbon for the mid-1990s; estimates of carbon distribution during pre-industrial times are significantly different.&lt;ref name=GC_128-9&gt;Post (2001) pp.&amp;nbsp;128–129.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}]]
Carbon is distributed throughout the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the oceans; these are referred to collectively as the carbon exchange reservoir,&lt;ref&gt;Aitken (2003), p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; and each component is also referred to individually as a carbon exchange reservoir.  The different elements of the carbon exchange reservoir vary in how much carbon they store, and in how long it takes for the {{chem|14|C}} generated by cosmic rays to fully mix with them.  This affects the ratio of {{chem|14|C}} to {{chem|12|C}} in the different reservoirs, and hence the radiocarbon ages of samples that originated in each reservoir.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt; The atmosphere, which is where {{chem|14|C}} is generated, contains about 1.9% of the total carbon in the reservoirs, and the {{chem|14|C}} it contains mixes in less than seven years.&lt;ref name="Warneck_690"&gt;Warneck (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;690.&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of {{chem|14|C}} to {{chem|12|C}} in the atmosphere is taken as the baseline for the other reservoirs: if another reservoir has a lower ratio of {{chem|14|C}} to {{chem|12|C}}, it indicates that the carbon is older and hence that either some of the {{chem|14|C}} has decayed, or the reservoir is receiving carbon that is not at the atmospheric baseline.&lt;ref name="Aitken (1990)" /&gt; The ocean surface is an example: it contains 2.4% of the carbon in the exchange reservoir, but there is only about 95% as much {{chem|14|C}} as would be expected if the ratio were the same as in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt; The time it takes for carbon from the atmosphere to mix with the surface ocean is only a few years,&lt;ref&gt;Ferronsky &amp; Polyakov (2012), p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; but the surface waters also receive water from the deep ocean, which has more than 90% of the carbon in the reservoir.&lt;ref name="Aitken (1990)" /&gt; Water in the deep ocean takes about 1,000 years to circulate back through surface waters, and so the surface waters contain a combination of older water, with depleted {{chem|14|C}}, and water recently at the surface, with {{chem|14|C}} in equilibrium with the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Aitken (1990)" /&gt;

Creatures living at the ocean surface have the same {{chem|14|C}} ratios as the water they live in, and as a result of the reduced {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio, the radiocarbon age of marine life is typically about 400 years.&lt;ref name="Bowman1995"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cronin2010"&gt;Cronin (2010), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms on land are in closer equilibrium with the atmosphere and have the same {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio as the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;{{#tag:ref|For marine life, the age only appears to be 400 years once a correction for [[Radiocarbon dating#Fractionation|fractionation]] is made.  This effect is accounted for during calibration by using a different marine calibration curve; without this curve, modern marine life would appear to be 400 years old when radiocarbon dated.  Similarly, the statement about land organisms is only true once fractionation is taken into account.|group=note}} These organisms contain about 1.3% of the carbon in the reservoir; sea organisms have a mass of less than 1% of those on land and are not shown on the diagram. Accumulated dead organic matter, of both plants and animals, exceeds the mass of the biosphere by a factor of nearly 3, and since this matter is no longer exchanging carbon with its environment, it has a {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio lower than that of the biosphere.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;

== Dating considerations ==
{{Main|Radiocarbon dating considerations}}
The variation in the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in different parts of the carbon exchange reservoir means that a straightforward calculation of the age of a sample based on the amount of {{chem|14|C}} it contains will often give an incorrect result. There are several other possible sources of error that need to be considered.  The errors are of four general types:
* variations in the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the atmosphere, both geographically and over time;
* isotopic fractionation;
* variations in the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in different parts of the reservoir;
* contamination.

=== Atmospheric variation ===
[[Image:Hemispheric 14C graphs 1950s to 2010.png|thumb|Atmospheric {{chem|14|C}} for the northern and southern hemispheres, showing percentage excess above pre-bomb levels.  The [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] went into effect on 10 October 1963.&lt;ref name="Hua_etal" /&gt;]]

In the early years of using the technique, it was understood that it depended on the atmospheric {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio having remained the same over the preceding few thousand years. To verify the accuracy of the method, several artefacts&lt;!-- This article uses British English, so please do not change this to "artifact". --&gt; that were datable by other techniques were tested; the results of the testing were in reasonable agreement with the true ages of the objects. Over time, however, discrepancies began to appear between the known chronology for the oldest Egyptian dynasties and the radiocarbon dates of Egyptian artefacts. Neither the pre-existing Egyptian chronology nor the new radiocarbon dating method could be assumed to be accurate, but a third possibility was that the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio had changed over time.  The question was resolved by the [[Dendrochronology|study of tree rings]]:&lt;ref name="Bowman_16-20"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp. 16–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suess_1970"&gt;Suess (1970), p.&amp;nbsp;303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014)"&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt; comparison of overlapping series of tree rings allowed the construction of a continuous sequence of tree-ring data that spanned 8,000 years.&lt;ref name="Bowman_16-20" /&gt;  (Since that time the tree-ring data series has been extended to 13,900 years.)&lt;ref name="INTCAL13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reimer|first=Paula J.|last2=Bard|first2=Edouard|last3=Bayliss|first3=Alex|last4=Beck|first4=J.

This was possible because although annual plants, such as corn, have a {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio that reflects the atmospheric ratio at the time they were growing, trees only add material to their outermost tree ring in any given year, while the inner tree rings don't get their {{chem|14|C}} replenished and instead start losing {{chem|14|C}} through decay.  Hence each ring preserves a record of the atmospheric {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio of the year it grew in.  Carbon-dating the wood from the tree rings themselves provides the check needed on the atmospheric {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio: with a sample of known date, and a measurement of the value of ''N'' (the number of atoms of {{chem|14|C}} remaining in the sample), the carbon-dating equation allows the calculation of ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; – the number of atoms of {{chem|14|C}} in the sample at the time the tree ring was formed – and hence the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the atmosphere at that time.&lt;ref name="Bowman_16-20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014)" /&gt; Equipped with the results of carbon-dating the tree rings, it became possible to construct calibration curves designed to correct the errors caused by the variation over time in the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp. 43–49.&lt;/ref&gt; These curves are described in more detail [[Radiocarbon dating#Calibration|below]].

Coal and oil began to be burned in large quantities during the 19th century. Both are sufficiently old that they contain little or no detectable {{chem|14|C}} and, as a result, the {{chem|CO|2}} released substantially diluted the atmospheric {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio. Dating an object from the early 20th century hence gives an apparent date older than the true date.  For the same reason, {{chem|14|C}} concentrations in the neighbourhood of large cities are lower than the atmospheric average. This fossil fuel effect (also known as the Suess effect, after Hans Suess, who first reported it in 1955) would only amount to a reduction of 0.2% in {{chem|14|C}} activity if the additional carbon from fossil fuels were distributed throughout the carbon exchange reservoir, but because of the long delay in mixing with the deep ocean, the actual effect is a 3% reduction.&lt;ref name="Bowman_16-20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aitken_71-72"&gt;Aitken (1990), pp.&amp;nbsp;71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

A much larger effect comes from above-ground nuclear testing, which released large numbers of neutrons and created {{chem|14|C}}. From about 1950 until 1963, when atmospheric nuclear testing was banned, it is estimated that several tonnes of {{chem|14|C}} were created. If all this extra {{chem|14|C}} had immediately been spread across the entire carbon exchange reservoir, it would have led to an increase in the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio of only a few per cent, but the immediate effect was to almost double the amount of {{chem|14|C}} in the atmosphere, with the peak level occurring in 1964 for the northern hemisphere, and in 1966 for the southern hemisphere. The level has since dropped, as this [[bomb pulse]] or "bomb carbon" (as it is sometimes called) percolates into the rest of the reservoir.&lt;ref name="Bowman_16-20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aitken_71-72" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PTBT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/t/isn/4797.htm|title=Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hua_etal"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hua|first=Quan|last2=Barbetti|first2=Mike|last3=Rakowski|first3=Andrzej Z.|date=2013|title=Atmospheric Radiocarbon for the Period 1950–2010|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/radiocarbon/article/atmospheric-radiocarbon-for-the-period-19502010/6BD120B674D0467B648CE1B8DF6428B8|journal=Radiocarbon|volume=55|issue=4|pages=2059–2072|doi=10.2458/azu_js_rc.v55i2.16177|issn=0033-8222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isotopic fractionation ===
Photosynthesis is the primary process by which carbon moves from the atmosphere into living things. In photosynthetic pathways {{chem|12|C}} is absorbed slightly more easily than {{chem|13|C}}, which in turn is more easily absorbed than {{chem|14|C}}. The differential uptake of the three carbon isotopes leads to {{chem|13|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} and {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratios in plants that differ from the ratios in the atmosphere. This effect is known as isotopic fractionation.&lt;ref name="Bowman_20-23"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;20–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leng_246"&gt;Maslin &amp; Swann (2006), p.&amp;nbsp;246.&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine the degree of fractionation that takes place in a given plant, the amounts of both {{chem|12|C}} and {{chem|13|C}} isotopes are measured, and the resulting {{chem|13|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio is then compared to a standard ratio known as PDB.{{#tag:ref|"PDB" stands for "Pee Dee Belemnite", a fossil from the [[Pee Dee Formation|Pee Dee formation]] in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;|group = note}}  The {{chem|13|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio is used instead of {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} because the former is much easier to measure, and the latter can be easily derived: the depletion of {{chem|13|C}} relative to {{chem|12|C}} is proportional to the difference in the atomic masses of the two isotopes, so the depletion for {{chem|14|C}} is twice the depletion of {{chem|13|C}}.&lt;ref name="Aitken (1990)" /&gt;  The fractionation of {{chem|13|C}}, known as {{delta|13|C|link}}, is calculated as follows:&lt;ref name="Bowman_20-23" /&gt;

:&lt;math chem&gt;\delta \ce{^{13}C} = \left( \frac{\left( \frac{\ce{^{13}C}}{\ce{^{12}C}} \right)_{sample}}{\left( \frac{\ce{^{13}C}}{\ce{^{12}C}} \right)_{standard}} -1 \right) \times 1000&lt;/math&gt; &amp;permil;

where the ‰ sign indicates [[parts per thousand]].&lt;ref name="Bowman_20-23" /&gt;  Because the PDB standard contains an unusually high proportion of {{chem|13|C}},{{#tag:ref|The PDB value is 11.2372‰.&lt;ref&gt;Dass (2007), p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;|group = note}} most measured {{delta|13|C}} values are negative.

[[File:NR sheep.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|[[North Ronaldsay sheep]] on the beach in [[North Ronaldsay]]. In the winter, these sheep eat seaweed, which has a higher {{delta|13|C}} content than grass; samples from these sheep have a {{delta|13|C}} value of about −13‰, which is much higher than for sheep that feed on grasses.&lt;ref name="Bowman_20-23" /&gt;]]

For marine organisms, the details of the photosynthesis reactions are less well understood, and the {{delta|13|C}} values for marine photosynthetic organisms are dependent on temperature. At higher temperatures, {{chem|CO|2}} has poor solubility in water, which means there is less {{chem|CO|2}} available for the photosynthetic reactions. Under these conditions, fractionation is reduced, and at temperatures above 14&amp;nbsp;°C the {{delta|13|C}} values are correspondingly higher, while at lower temperatures, {{chem|CO|2}} becomes more soluble and hence more available to marine organisms.&lt;ref name="Leng_246" /&gt; The {{delta|13|C}} value for animals depends on their diet. An animal that eats food with high {{delta|13|C}} values will have a higher {{delta|13|C}} than one that eats food with lower {{delta|13|C}} values.&lt;ref name="Bowman_20-23" /&gt; The animal's own biochemical processes can also impact the results: for example, both bone minerals and bone collagen typically have a higher concentration of {{chem|13|C}} than is found in the animal's diet, though for different biochemical reasons. The enrichment of bone {{chem|13|C}} also implies that excreted material is depleted in {{Chem|13|C}} relative to the diet.&lt;ref&gt;Schoeninger (2010), p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since {{chem|13|C}} makes up about 1% of the carbon in a sample, the {{chem|13|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio can be accurately measured by [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name="Aitken (1990)" /&gt; Typical values of {{delta|13|C}} have been found by experiment for many plants, as well as for different parts of animals such as bone [[collagen]], but when dating a given sample it is better to determine the {{delta|13|C}} value for that sample directly than to rely on the published values.&lt;ref name="Bowman_20-23" /&gt;

The carbon exchange between atmospheric {{chem|CO|2}} and carbonate at the ocean surface is also subject to fractionation, with {{chem|14|C}} in the atmosphere more likely than {{chem|12|C}} to dissolve in the ocean. The result is an overall increase in the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the ocean of 1.5%, relative to the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the atmosphere. This increase in {{chem|14|C}} concentration almost exactly cancels out the decrease caused by the upwelling of water (containing old, and hence {{chem|14|C}} depleted, carbon) from the deep ocean, so that direct measurements of {{chem|14|C}} radiation are similar to measurements for the rest of the biosphere. Correcting for isotopic fractionation, as is done for all radiocarbon dates to allow comparison between results from different parts of the biosphere, gives an apparent age of about 400 years for ocean surface water.&lt;ref name="Aitken (1990)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cronin2010" /&gt;

=== Reservoir effects ===
Libby's original exchange reservoir hypothesis assumed that the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the exchange reservoir is constant all over the world,&lt;ref name="Libby1965"&gt;Libby (1965), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; but it has since been discovered that there are several causes of variation in the ratio across the reservoir.&lt;ref name="Bowman1995" /&gt;

'''[[Marine reservoir effect|Marine effect]]'''

The {{chem|CO|2}} in the atmosphere transfers to the ocean by dissolving in the surface water as carbonate and bicarbonate ions; at the same time the carbonate ions in the water are returning to the air as {{chem|CO|2}}.&lt;ref name="Libby1965" /&gt; This exchange process brings{{chem|14|C}} from the atmosphere into the surface waters of the ocean, but the {{chem|14|C}} thus introduced takes a long time to percolate through the entire volume of the ocean. The deepest parts of the ocean mix very slowly with the surface waters, and the mixing is uneven. The main mechanism that brings deep water to the surface is upwelling, which is more common in regions closer to the equator. Upwelling is also influenced by factors such as the topography of the local ocean bottom and coastlines, the climate, and wind patterns. Overall, the mixing of deep and surface waters takes far longer than the mixing of atmospheric {{chem|CO|2}} with the surface waters, and as a result water from some deep ocean areas has an apparent radiocarbon age of several thousand years. Upwelling mixes this "old" water with the surface water, giving the surface water an apparent age of about several hundred years (after correcting for fractionation).&lt;ref name="Bowman1995" /&gt; This effect is not uniform&amp;nbsp;– the average effect is about 400 years, but there are local deviations of several hundred years for areas that are geographically close to each other.&lt;ref name="Bowman1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cronin2010" /&gt; These deviations can be accounted for in calibration, and users of software such as CALIB can provide as an input the appropriate correction for the location of their samples.&lt;ref name=Alves2018&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Queiroz-Alves|first1=Eduardo|last2=Macario|first2=Kita |last3=Ascough|first3=Philippa |last4=Bronk Ramsey|first4=Christopher |year=2018|title=The worldwide marine radiocarbon reservoir effect: Definitions, mechanisms and prospects|journal=Reviews of Geophysics |volume=56|issue=1|pages=278–305|doi=10.1002/2017RG000588|bibcode=2018RvGeo..56..278A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The effect also applies to marine organisms such as shells, and marine mammals such as whales and seals, which have radiocarbon ages that appear to be hundreds of years old.&lt;ref name="Bowman1995" /&gt;

'''Hemisphere effect'''

The northern and southern hemispheres have [[atmospheric circulation]] systems that are sufficiently independent of each other that there is a noticeable time lag in mixing between the two. The atmospheric {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio is lower in the southern hemisphere, with an apparent additional age of about 40 years for radiocarbon results from the south as compared to the north.{{#tag:ref|Two recent estimates included 8-80 radiocarbon years over the last 1000 years, with an average of 41 ± 14 years; and -2 to 83 radiocarbon years over the last 2000 years, with an average of 44 ± 17 years.  For older datasets an offset of about 50 years has been estimated.&lt;ref name="Hoggetal" /&gt;|group=note}} This is because the greater surface area of ocean in the southern hemisphere means that there is more carbon exchanged between the ocean and the atmosphere than in the north. Since the surface ocean is depleted in {{chem|14|C}} because of the marine effect, {{chem|14|C}} is removed from the southern atmosphere more quickly than in the north.&lt;ref name="Bowman1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoggetal"&gt;Hogg et al. (2013), p. 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;  The effect is strengthened by strong upwelling around Antarctica.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

'''Other effects'''

If the carbon in freshwater is partly acquired from aged carbon, such as rocks, then the result will be a reduction in the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the water. For example, rivers that pass over [[limestone]], which is mostly composed of [[calcium carbonate]], will acquire carbonate ions. Similarly, groundwater can contain carbon derived from the rocks through which it has passed. These rocks are usually so old that they no longer contain any measurable {{chem|14|C}}, so this carbon lowers the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio of the water it enters, which can lead to apparent ages of thousands of years for both the affected water and the plants and freshwater organisms that live in it.&lt;ref name="Aitken (1990)" /&gt; This is known as the [[hard water]] effect because it is often associated with calcium ions, which are characteristic of hard water; other sources of carbon such as [[humus]] can produce similar results, and can also reduce the apparent age if they are of more recent origin than the sample.&lt;ref name="Bowman1995" /&gt;  The effect varies greatly and there is no general offset that can be applied; additional research is usually needed to determine the size of the offset, for example by comparing the radiocarbon age of deposited freshwater shells with associated organic material.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Volcanic eruptions]] eject large amounts of carbon into the air. The carbon is of geological origin and has no detectable {{chem|14|C}}, so the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the vicinity of the volcano is depressed relative to surrounding areas. Dormant volcanoes can also emit aged carbon. Plants that photosynthesize this carbon also have lower {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratios: for example, plants in the neighbourhood of the [[Furnas]] caldera in the [[Azores]] were found to have apparent ages that ranged from 250 years to 3320 years.&lt;ref&gt;Pasquier-Cardina et al. (1999), pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contamination ===
Any addition of carbon to a sample of a different age will cause the measured date to be inaccurate. Contamination with modern carbon causes a sample to appear to be younger than it really is: the effect is greater for older samples. If a sample that is 17,000 years old is contaminated so that 1% of the sample is modern carbon, it will appear to be 600 years younger; for a sample that is 34,000 years old the same amount of contamination would cause an error of 4,000 years. Contamination with old carbon, with no remaining {{chem|14|C}}, causes an error in the other direction independent of age&amp;nbsp;– a sample contaminated with 1% old carbon will appear to be about 80 years older than it really is, regardless of the date of the sample.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken (1990), pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Samples ==
{{Main|Radiocarbon dating samples}}
Samples for dating need to be converted into a form suitable for measuring the {{chem|14|C}} content; this can mean conversion to gaseous, liquid, or solid form, depending on the measurement technique to be used. Before this can be done, the sample must be treated to remove any contamination and any unwanted constituents.&lt;ref name="Bowman_27-30"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;27–30.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes removing visible contaminants, such as rootlets that may have penetrated the sample since its burial.&lt;ref name="Bowman_27-30" /&gt;  Alkali and acid washes can be used to remove humic acid and carbonate contamination, but care has to be taken to avoid removing the part of the sample that contains the carbon to be tested.&lt;ref name="AitkenWashing"&gt;Aitken (1990), pp. 86–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Material considerations ===
* It is common to reduce a wood sample to just the cellulose component before testing, but since this can reduce the volume of the sample to 20% of its original size, testing of the whole wood is often performed as well. Charcoal is often tested but is likely to need treatment to remove contaminants.&lt;ref name="Bowman_27-30" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AitkenWashing" /&gt;
* Unburnt bone can be tested; it is usual to date it using [[collagen]], the protein fraction that remains after washing away the bone's structural material. [[Hydroxyproline]], one of the constituent amino acids in bone, was once thought to be a reliable indicator as it was not known to occur except in bone, but it has since been detected in groundwater.&lt;ref name="Bowman_27-30" /&gt;
* For burnt bone, testability depends on the conditions under which the bone was burnt. If the bone was heated under [[reducing conditions]], it (and associated organic matter) may have been carbonized. In this case the sample is often usable.&lt;ref name="Bowman_27-30" /&gt;
* Shells from both marine and land organisms consist almost entirely of calcium carbonate, either as [[aragonite]] or as [[calcite]], or some mixture of the two. Calcium carbonate is very susceptible to dissolving and recrystallizing; the recrystallized material will contain carbon from the sample's environment, which may be of geological origin.  If testing recrystallized shell is unavoidable, it is sometimes possible to identify the original shell material from a sequence of tests.&lt;ref&gt;Šilar (2004), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible to test [[conchiolin]], an organic protein found in shell, but it constitutes only 1–2% of shell material.&lt;ref name="AitkenWashing" /&gt;
* The three major components of peat are humic acid, [[humins]], and fulvic acid. Of these, humins give the most reliable date as they are insoluble in alkali and less likely to contain contaminants from the sample's environment.&lt;ref name="AitkenWashing" /&gt; A particular difficulty with dried peat is the removal of rootlets, which are likely to be hard to distinguish from the sample material.&lt;ref name="Bowman_27-30" /&gt;
* Soil contains organic material, but because of the likelihood of contamination by humic acid of more recent origin, it is very difficult to get satisfactory radiocarbon dates. It is preferable to sieve the soil for fragments of organic origin, and date the fragments with methods that are tolerant of small sample sizes.&lt;ref name="AitkenWashing" /&gt;
* Other materials that have been successfully dated include ivory, paper, textiles, individual seeds and grains, straw from within mud bricks, and charred food remains found in pottery.&lt;ref name="AitkenWashing" /&gt;

=== Preparation and size ===
Particularly for older samples, it may be useful to enrich the amount of {{chem|14|C}} in the sample before testing. This can be done with a thermal diffusion column. The process takes about a month and requires a sample about ten times as large as would be needed otherwise, but it allows more precise measurement of the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in old material and extends the maximum age that can be reliably reported.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman (1995), pp. 37–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once contamination has been removed, samples must be converted to a form suitable for the measuring technology to be used.&lt;ref name="BowmanMeasure"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp. 31–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Where gas is required, {{Chem|CO|2}} is widely used.&lt;ref name="BowmanMeasure" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aitken_76-78"&gt;Aitken (1990), pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt; For samples to be used in [[Liquid scintillation counting|liquid scintillation counters]], the carbon must be in liquid form; the sample is typically converted to [[benzene]]. For [[accelerator mass spectrometry]], solid graphite targets are the most common, although gaseous {{Chem|CO|2}} can also be used.&lt;ref name="BowmanMeasure" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trumbore96"&gt;Trumbore (1996), p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantity of material needed for testing depends on the sample type and the technology being used. There are two types of testing technology: detectors that record radioactivity, known as beta counters, and accelerator mass spectrometers. For beta counters, a sample weighing at least {{convert|10|g|abbr=off}} is typically required.&lt;ref name="BowmanMeasure" /&gt;   Accelerator mass spectrometry is much more sensitive, and samples containing as little as 0.5 milligrams of carbon can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and results ==
[[File:1 MV accelerator mass spectrometer.jpg|thumb|Measuring {{Chem|14|C}} is now most commonly done with an accelerator mass spectrometer]]
For decades after Libby performed the first radiocarbon dating experiments, the only way to measure the {{chem|14|C}} in a sample was to detect the radioactive decay of individual carbon atoms.&lt;ref name="BowmanMeasure" /&gt; In this approach, what is measured is the activity, in number of decay events per unit mass per time period, of the sample.&lt;ref name="Aitken_76-78" /&gt; This method is also known as "beta counting", because it is the beta particles emitted by the decaying {{chem|14|C}} atoms that are detected.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (2005), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s an alternative approach became available: directly counting the number of {{Chem|14|C}} and {{Chem|12|C}} atoms in a given sample, via accelerator mass spectrometry, usually referred to as AMS.&lt;ref name="BowmanMeasure" /&gt; AMS counts the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio directly, instead of the activity of the sample, but measurements of activity and {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio can be converted into each other exactly.&lt;ref name="Aitken_76-78" /&gt; For some time, beta counting methods were more accurate than AMS, but AMS is now more accurate and has become the method of choice for radiocarbon measurements.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Walker (2005), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Killick (2014), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to improved accuracy, AMS has two further significant advantages over beta counting: it can perform accurate testing on samples much too small for beta counting; and it is much faster&amp;nbsp;– an accuracy of 1% can be achieved in minutes with AMS, which is far quicker than would be achievable with the older technology.&lt;ref&gt;Malainey (2010), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beta counting ===
Libby's first detector was a [[Geiger counter]] of his own design. He converted the carbon in his sample to lamp black (soot) and coated the inner surface of a cylinder with it.  This cylinder was inserted into the counter in such a way that the counting wire was inside the sample cylinder, in order that there should be no material between the sample and the wire.&lt;ref name="BowmanMeasure" /&gt; Any interposing material would have interfered with the detection of radioactivity, since the beta particles emitted by decaying {{Chem|14|C}} are so weak that half are stopped by a 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm thickness of aluminium.&lt;ref name="Aitken_76-78" /&gt;

Libby's method was soon superseded by gas [[proportional counter]]s, which were less affected by bomb carbon (the additional {{Chem|14|C}} created by nuclear weapons testing). These counters record bursts of ionization caused by the beta particles emitted by the decaying {{Chem|14|C}} atoms; the bursts are proportional to the energy of the particle, so other sources of ionization, such as background radiation, can be identified and ignored. The counters are surrounded by lead or steel shielding, to eliminate background radiation and to reduce the incidence of cosmic rays. In addition, [[Electronic anticoincidence|anticoincidence]] detectors are used; these record events outside the counter, and any event recorded simultaneously both inside and outside the counter is regarded as an extraneous event and ignored.&lt;ref name="Aitken_76-78" /&gt;

The other common technology used for measuring {{Chem|14|C}} activity is liquid scintillation counting, which was invented in 1950, but which had to wait until the early 1960s, when efficient methods of benzene synthesis were developed, to become competitive with gas counting; after 1970 liquid counters became the more common technology choice for newly constructed dating laboratories. The counters work by detecting flashes of light caused by the beta particles emitted by {{chem|14|C}} as they interact with a fluorescing agent added to the benzene. Like gas counters, liquid scintillation counters require shielding and anticoincidence counters.&lt;ref&gt;Theodórsson (1996), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L'Annunziata &amp; Kessler (2012), p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

For both the gas proportional counter and liquid scintillation counter, what is measured is the number of beta particles detected in a given time period. Since the mass of the sample is known, this can be converted to a standard measure of activity in units of either counts per minute per gram of carbon (cpm/g C), or [[becquerel]]s per kg (Bq/kg C, in [[SI units]]). Each measuring device is also used to measure the activity of a blank sample&amp;nbsp;– a sample prepared from carbon old enough to have no activity. This provides a value for the background radiation, which must be subtracted from the measured activity of the sample being dated to get the activity attributable solely to that sample's {{Chem|14|C}}. In addition, a sample with a standard activity is measured, to provide a baseline for comparison.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Eriksson Stenström et al. (2011), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accelerator mass spectrometry ===
[[File:Accelerator mass spectrometer schematic for radiocarbon.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Simplified schematic layout of an accelerator mass spectrometer used for counting carbon isotopes for carbon dating]]
AMS counts the atoms of {{Chem|14|C}} and {{Chem|12|C}} in a given sample, determining the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio directly. The sample, often in the form of graphite, is made to emit C&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions (carbon atoms with a single negative charge), which are injected into an [[Particle accelerator|accelerator]]. The ions are accelerated and passed through a stripper, which removes several electrons so that the ions emerge with a positive charge.  The ions, which may have from 1 to 4 positive charges (C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to C&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;), depending on the accelerator design, are then passed through a magnet that curves their path; the heavier ions are curved less than the lighter ones, so the different isotopes emerge as separate streams of ions. A particle detector then records the number of ions detected in the {{Chem|14|C}} stream, but since the volume of {{Chem|12|C}} (and {{Chem|13|C}}, needed for calibration) is too great for individual ion detection, counts are determined by measuring the electric current created in a [[Faraday cup]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Aitken (1990), pp. 82–85.&lt;/ref&gt; The large positive charge induced by the stripper forces molecules such as {{chem|13|CH}}, which has a weight close enough to {{chem|14|C}} to interfere with the measurements, to dissociate, so they are not detected.&lt;ref name="Wiebert"&gt;Wiebert (1995), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most AMS machines also measure the sample's {{delta|13|C}}, for use in calculating the sample's radiocarbon age.&lt;ref&gt;Tuniz, Zoppi &amp; Barbetti (2004), p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of AMS, as opposed to simpler forms of mass spectrometry, is necessary because of the need to distinguish the carbon isotopes from other atoms or molecules that are very close in mass, such as {{chem|14|N}} and {{chem|13|CH}}.&lt;ref name="BowmanMeasure" /&gt; As with beta counting, both blank samples and standard samples are used.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Two different kinds of blank may be measured: a sample of dead carbon that has undergone no chemical processing, to detect any machine background, and a sample known as a process blank made from dead carbon that is processed into target material in exactly the same way as the sample which is being dated. Any {{Chem|14|C}} signal from the machine background blank is likely to be caused either by beams of ions that have not followed the expected path inside the detector, or by carbon hydrides such as {{chem|12|CH|2}} or {{chem|13|CH}}. A {{chem|14|C}} signal from the process blank measures the amount of contamination introduced during the preparation of the sample. These measurements are used in the subsequent calculation of the age of the sample.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McNichol|first=A.P.|last2=Jull|first2=A.T.S.|last3=Burr|first3=G.S.|year=2001|title=Converting AMS data to radiocarbon values: considerations and conventions|url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/3969/3394|journal=Radiocarbon|volume=43|issue=2A|pages=313–320|doi=10.1017/S0033822200038169|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calculations ===
{{Main|Calculation of radiocarbon dates}}
The calculations to be performed on the measurements taken depend on the technology used, since beta counters measure the sample's radioactivity whereas AMS determines the ratio of the three different carbon isotopes in the sample.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

To determine the age of a sample whose activity has been measured by beta counting, the ratio of its activity to the activity of the standard must be found. To determine this, a blank sample (of old, or dead, carbon) is measured, and a sample of known activity is measured. The additional samples allow errors such as background radiation and systematic errors in the laboratory setup to be detected and corrected for.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The most common standard sample material is oxalic acid, such as the HOxII standard, 1,000&amp;nbsp;lb of which was prepared by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) in 1977 from French beet harvests.&lt;ref&gt;Terasmae (1984), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L'Annunziata (2007), p. 528.&lt;/ref&gt;

The results from AMS testing are in the form of ratios of {{chem|12|C}}, {{chem|13|C}}, and {{chem|14|C}}, which are used to calculate Fm, the "fraction modern". This is defined as the ratio between the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in the sample and the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio in modern carbon, which is in turn defined as the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio that would have been measured in 1950 had there been no fossil fuel effect.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Both beta counting and AMS results have to be corrected for fractionation. This is necessary because different materials of the same age, which because of fractionation have naturally different {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratios, will appear to be of different ages because the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio is taken as the indicator of age. To avoid this, all radiocarbon measurements are converted to the measurement that would have been seen had the sample been made of wood, which has a known δ{{chem|13|C}} value of −25‰.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Once the corrected {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio is known, a "radiocarbon age" is calculated using:&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whoi.edu/nosams/page.do?pid=40146 |title=Radiocarbon Data Calculations: NOSAMS|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|year=2007|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Age} = -8033 \cdot \ln (Fm)&lt;/math&gt;

The calculation uses 8,033, the mean-life derived from Libby's half-life of 5,568 years, not 8,267, the mean-life derived from the more accurate modern value of 5,730 years. Libby’s value for the half-life is used to maintain consistency with early radiocarbon testing results; calibration curves include a correction for this, so the accuracy of final reported calendar ages is assured.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Errors and reliability ===
The reliability of the results can be improved by lengthening the testing time. For example, if counting beta decays for 250 minutes is enough to give an error of ± 80 years, with 68% confidence, then doubling the counting time to 500 minutes will allow a sample with only half as much {{Chem|14|C}} to be measured with the same error term of 80 years.&lt;ref name="Bowman_38-39"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radiocarbon dating is generally limited to dating samples no more than 50,000 years old, as samples older than that have insufficient {{chem|14|C}} to be measurable.  Older dates have been obtained by using special sample preparation techniques, large samples, and very long measurement times.  These techniques can allow measurement of dates up to 60,000 and in some cases up to 75,000 years before the present.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Radiocarbon dates are generally presented with a range of one [[standard deviation]] (usually represented by the Greek letter sigma as 1σ) on either side of the mean. However, a date range of 1σ represents only 68% confidence level, so the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted. This was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory, in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a [[normal distribution]] of errors in the measurements), and included multiple date ranges (of 1σ confidence) that did not overlap with each other. The measurements included one with a range from about 4250 to about 4390 years ago, and another with a range from about 4520 to about 4690.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1987), pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Errors in procedure can also lead to errors in the results. If 1% of the benzene in a modern reference sample accidentally evaporates, scintillation counting will give a radiocarbon age that is too young by about 80 years.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman (1995), pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calibration&lt;!--'Calibrated years' redirects here--&gt; ===
{{Main|Calibration of radiocarbon dates}}
[[File:Prometheus tree1.jpg|left|thumb|The stump of a very old bristlecone pine.  Tree rings from these trees (among others) are used in building calibration curves.]]
The calculations given above produce dates in radiocarbon years: i.e. dates that represent the age the sample would be if the {{chem|14|C}}/{{chem|12|C}} ratio had been constant historically.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Libby had pointed out as early as 1955 the possibility that this assumption was incorrect, it was not until discrepancies began to accumulate between measured ages and known historical dates for artefacts that it became clear that a correction would need to be applied to radiocarbon ages to obtain calendar dates.&lt;ref name="Aitken_66-67"&gt;Aitken (1990), p.&amp;nbsp;66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

To produce a curve that can be used to relate calendar years to radiocarbon years, a sequence of securely dated samples is needed which can be tested to determine their radiocarbon age. The study of tree rings led to the first such sequence: individual pieces of wood show characteristic sequences of rings that vary in thickness because of environmental factors such as the amount of rainfall in a given year. These factors affect all trees in an area, so examining tree-ring sequences from old wood allows the identification of overlapping sequences. In this way, an uninterrupted sequence of tree rings can be extended far into the past. The first such published sequence, based on bristlecone pine tree rings, was created by [[Wesley Ferguson]].&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014)" /&gt; Hans Suess used this data to publish the first calibration curve for radiocarbon dating in 1967.&lt;ref name="Bowman_16-20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suess_1970" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aitken_66-67" /&gt; The curve showed two types of variation from the straight line: a long term fluctuation with a period of about 9,000 years, and a shorter term variation, often referred to as "wiggles", with a period of decades. Suess said he drew the line showing the wiggles by "cosmic ''schwung''", by which he meant that the variations were caused by extraterrestrial forces. It was unclear for some time whether the wiggles were real or not, but they are now well-established.&lt;ref name="Bowman_16-20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suess_1970" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  These short term fluctuations in the calibration curve are now known as de Vries effects, after [[Hessel de Vries]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

A calibration curve is used by taking the radiocarbon date reported by a laboratory, and reading across from that date on the vertical axis of the graph. The point where this horizontal line intersects the curve will give the calendar age of the sample on the horizontal axis. This is the reverse of the way the curve is constructed: a point on the graph is derived from a sample of known age, such as a tree ring; when it is tested, the resulting radiocarbon age gives a data point for the graph.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;[[File:Intcal 13 calibration curve.png|thumb|The Northern hemisphere curve from INTCAL13.  As of 2014 this is the most recent version of the standard calibration curve.  The diagonal line shows where the curve would lie if radiocarbon ages and calendar ages were the same.&lt;ref name="INTCAL13"/&gt;]]Over the next thirty years many calibration curves were published using a variety of methods and statistical approaches.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; These were superseded by the INTCAL series of curves, beginning with INTCAL98, published in 1998, and updated in 2004, 2009, and 2013. The improvements to these curves are based on new data gathered from tree rings, [[varve]]s, [[coral]], plant [[macrofossil]]s, [[speleothems]], and [[foraminifera]].  The INTCAL13 data includes separate curves for the northern and southern hemispheres, as they differ systematically because of the hemisphere effect.  The southern curve (SHCAL13) is based on independent data where possible, and derived from the northern curve by adding the average offset for the southern hemisphere where no direct data was available. There is also a separate marine calibration curve, MARINE13.&lt;ref name="INTCAL13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stuiver|first=M.|last2=Braziunas|first2=T.F.|year=1993|title=Modelling atmospheric {{chem|14|C}} influences and {{chem|14|C}} ages of marine samples to 10,000 BC|url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/1558/1562|journal=Radiocarbon|volume=35|issue=1|pages=137–189|doi=10.1017/s0033822200013874}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a set of samples forming a sequence with a known separation in time, these samples form a subset of the calibration curve. The sequence can be compared to the calibration curve and the best match to the sequence established. This “wiggle-matching” technique can lead to more precise dating than is possible with individual radiocarbon dates.&lt;ref name="Walker2005"&gt;Walker (2005), pp. 35–37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wiggle-matching can be used in places where there is a plateau on the calibration curve, and hence can provide a much more accurate date than the intercept or probability methods are able to produce.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken (1990), pp. 103–105.&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique is not restricted to tree rings; for example, a stratified [[tephra]] sequence in New Zealand, known to predate human colonization of the islands, has been dated to 1314&amp;nbsp;AD ± 12 years by wiggle-matching.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (2005), pp. 207–209.&lt;/ref&gt; The wiggles also mean that reading a date from a calibration curve can give more than one answer: this occurs when the curve wiggles up and down enough that the radiocarbon age intercepts the curve in more than one place, which may lead to a radiocarbon result being reported as two separate age ranges, corresponding to the two parts of the curve that the radiocarbon age intercepted.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

[[Bayesian inference|Bayesian statistical techniques]] can be applied when there are several radiocarbon dates to be calibrated.  For example, if a series of radiocarbon dates is taken from different levels in a stratigraphic sequence, Bayesian analysis can be used to evaluate dates which are outliers, and can calculate improved probability distributions, based on the prior information that the sequence should be ordered in time.&lt;ref name="Walker2005" /&gt;  When Bayesian analysis was introduced, its use was limited by the need to use mainframe computers to perform the calculations, but the technique has since been implemented on programs available for personal computers, such as OxCal.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), pp. 148–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reporting dates ===
Several formats for citing radiocarbon results have been used since the first samples were dated. As of 2014, the standard format required by the journal ''[[Radiocarbon (magazine)|Radiocarbon]]'' is as follows.&lt;ref name=Radiocarbon_Authors&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.radiocarbon.org/Authors/author-info.pdf |title= Radiocarbon: Information for Authors |author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= May 25, 2011 |website= Radiocarbon |publisher= University of Arizona |pages= 5–7 |accessdate= 1 January 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130810014457/http://www.radiocarbon.org/Authors/author-info.pdf |archivedate= 10 August 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uncalibrated dates should be reported as "&lt;laboratory&gt;: &lt;{{chem|14|C}} year&gt; ± &lt;range&gt; BP", where:
* &lt;laboratory&gt; identifies the laboratory that tested the sample, and the sample ID
* &lt;{{chem|14|C}} year&gt; is the laboratory's determination of the age of the sample, in radiocarbon years
* &lt;range&gt; is the laboratory's estimate of the error in the age, at 1σ confidence.
* BP stands for "[[before present]]", referring to a reference date of 1950, so that 500 BP means the year 1450 AD.

For example, the uncalibrated date "UtC-2020: 3510 ± 60 BP" indicates that the sample was tested by the Utrecht van der Graaff Laboratorium, where it has a sample number of 2020, and that the uncalibrated age is 3510 years before present, ± 60 years. Related forms are sometimes used: for example, "10 ka BP" means 10,000 radiocarbon years before present (i.e. 8,050 BC), and {{chem|14|C}} yr BP might be used to distinguish the uncalibrated date from a date derived from another dating method such as [[Thermoluminescence dating|thermoluminescence]].&lt;ref name=Radiocarbon_Authors /&gt;

Calibrated {{chem|14|C}} dates are frequently reported as cal BP, cal BC, or cal AD, again with BP referring to the year 1950 as the zero date.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Radiocarbon'' gives two options for reporting calibrated dates. A common format is "cal &lt;date-range&gt; &lt;confidence&gt;", where:
* &lt;date-range&gt; is the range of dates corresponding to the given confidence level
* &lt;confidence&gt; indicates the confidence level for the given date range.

For example, "cal 1220–1281 AD (1σ)" means a calibrated date for which the true date lies between 1220 AD and 1281 AD, with the confidence level given as 1σ, or one standard deviation. Calibrated dates can also be expressed as BP instead of using BC and AD. The curve used to calibrate the results should be the latest available INTCAL curve. Calibrated dates should also identify any programs, such as OxCal, used to perform the calibration.&lt;ref name="Radiocarbon_Authors" /&gt;  In addition, an article in ''Radiocarbon'' in 2014 about radiocarbon date reporting conventions recommends that information should be provided about sample treatment, including the sample material, pretreatment methods, and quality control measurements; that the citation to the software used for calibration should specify the version number and any options or models used; and that the calibrated date should be given with the associated probabilities for each range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Millard|first=Andrew R.|date=2014|title=Conventions for Reporting Radiocarbon Determinations|journal=Radiocarbon|volume=56|issue=2|pages=555–559|doi=10.2458/56.17455|doi-access=free|url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/21052/1/21052.pdf|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in archaeology ==

=== Interpretation ===
A key concept in interpreting radiocarbon dates is [[archaeological association]]: what is the true relationship between two or more objects at an archaeological site?  It frequently happens that a sample for radiocarbon dating can be taken directly from the object of interest, but there are also many cases where this is not possible.  Metal grave goods, for example, cannot be radiocarbon dated, but they may be found in a grave with a coffin, charcoal, or other material which can be assumed to have been deposited at the same time.  In these cases a date for the coffin or charcoal is indicative of the date of deposition of the grave goods, because of the direct functional relationship between the two.  There are also cases where there is no functional relationship, but the association is reasonably strong: for example, a layer of charcoal in a rubbish pit provides a date which has a relationship to the rubbish pit.&lt;ref&gt;Mook &amp; Waterbolk (1985), pp.&amp;nbsp;48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contamination is of particular concern when dating very old material obtained from archaeological excavations and great care is needed in the specimen selection and preparation. In 2014, [[Thomas Higham]] and co-workers suggested that many of the dates published for [[Neanderthal]] artefacts are too recent because of contamination by "young carbon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Higham | first1=T. | year=2014 | title=The timing and spatiotemporal patterning of Neanderthal disappearance | journal=Nature | volume=512 | issue=7514 | pages=306–309 | doi=10.1038/nature13621| pmid=25143113 | displayauthors=1 | last2=Wood | first2=Rachel | last3=Ramsey | first3=Christopher Bronk | last4=Brock | first4=Fiona | last5=Basell | first5=Laura | last6=Camps | first6=Marta | last7=Arrizabalaga | first7=Alvaro | last8=Baena | first8=Javier | last9=Barroso-Ruíz | first9=Cecillio | last10=Bergman | first10=Christopher | last11=Boitard | first11=Coralie | last12=Boscato | first12=Paolo | last13=Caparrós | first13=Miguel | last14=Conard | first14=Nicholas J. | last15=Draily | first15=Christelle | last16=Froment | first16=Alain | last17=Galván | first17=Bertila | last18=Gambassini | first18=Paolo | last19=Garcia-Moreno | first19=Alejandro | last20=Grimaldi | first20=Stefano | last21=Haesaerts | first21=Paul | last22=Holt | first22=Brigitte | last23=Iriarte-Chiapusso | first23=Maria-Jose | last24=Jelinek | first24=Arthur | last25=Jordá Pardo | first25=Jesús F. | last26=Maíllo-Fernández | first26=José-Manuel | last27=Marom | first27=Anat | last28=Maroto | first28=Julià | last29=Menéndez | first29=Mario | bibcode=2014Natur.512..306H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a tree grows, only the outermost tree ring exchanges carbon with its environment, so the age measured for a wood sample depends on where the sample is taken from.  This means that radiocarbon dates on wood samples can be older than the date at which the tree was felled.  In addition, if a piece of wood is used for multiple purposes, there may be a significant delay between the felling of the tree and the final use in the context in which it is found.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Bowman (1995), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is often referred to as the "[[old wood]]" problem.&lt;ref name="Bowman_9-15" /&gt;  One example is the Bronze Age [[trackway]] at Withy Bed Copse, in England; the trackway was built from wood that had clearly been worked for other purposes before being re-used in the trackway.  Another example is driftwood, which may be used as construction material.  It is not always possible to recognize re-use.  Other materials can present the same problem: for example, [[bitumen]] is known to have been used by some [[Neolithic]] communities to waterproof baskets; the bitumen's radiocarbon age will be greater than is measurable by the laboratory, regardless of the actual age of the context, so testing the basket material will give a misleading age if care is not taken.  A separate issue, related to re-use, is that of lengthy use, or delayed deposition.  For example, a wooden object that remains in use for a lengthy period will have an apparent age greater than the actual age of the context in which it is deposited.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

===Use outside archaeology===
Archaeology is not the only field to make use of radiocarbon dating.  The ability to date minute samples using AMS has meant that palaeobotanists and palaeoclimatologists can use radiocarbon dating on pollen samples.  Radiocarbon dates can also be used in geology, sedimentology, and lake studies, for example.  Dates on organic material recovered from strata of interest can be used to correlate strata in different locations that appear to be similar on geological grounds.  Dating material from one location gives date information about the other location, and the dates are also used to place strata in the overall geological timeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godwin|first1=Harry|date=|year=1961|title=The Croonian Lecture: Radiocarbon Dating and Quaternary History in Britain|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/153/952/287.full.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|volume=153|issue=952|pages=287–320|via=|doi=10.1098/rspb.1961.0001|bibcode=1961RSPSB.153..287G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notable applications ===

==== Pleistocene/Holocene boundary in Two Creeks Fossil Forest ====
The [[Pleistocene]] is a geological epoch that began about 2.6 million years ago.  The [[Holocene]], the current geological epoch, begins about 11,700 years ago, when the Pleistocene ends.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), pp. 34–37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Establishing the date of this boundary − which is defined by sharp climatic warming − as accurately as possible has been a goal of geologists for much of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bousman &amp; Vierra (2012), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[Two Creeks, Wisconsin|Two Creeks]], in Wisconsin, a fossil forest was discovered ([[Two Creeks Buried Forest State Natural Area]]), and subsequent research determined that the destruction of the forest was caused by the Valders ice readvance, the last southward movement of ice before the end of the Pleistocene in that area.  Before the advent of radiocarbon dating, the fossilized trees had been dated by correlating sequences of annually deposited layers of sediment at Two Creeks with sequences in Scandinavia. This led to estimates that the trees were between 24,000 and 19,000 years old,&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; and hence this was taken to be the date of the last advance of the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] before its final retreat marked the end of the Pleistocene in North America.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Macdougall (2008), pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1952 Libby published radiocarbon dates for several samples from the Two Creeks site and two similar sites nearby; the dates were averaged to 11,404 BP with a standard error of 350 years.  This result was uncalibrated, as the need for calibration of radiocarbon ages was not yet understood.  Further results over the next decade supported an average date of 11,350 BP, with the results thought to be most accurate averaging 11,600 BP.  There was initial resistance to these results on the part of [[Ernst Antevs]], the [[palaeobotanist]] who had worked on the Scandinavian varve series, but his objections were eventually discounted by other geologists.  In the 1990s samples were tested with AMS, yielding (uncalibrated) dates ranging from 11,640 BP to 11,800 BP, both with a standard error of 160 years.  Subsequently, a sample from the fossil forest was used in an interlaboratory test, with results provided by over 70 laboratories.  These tests produced a median age of 11,788 ± 8 BP (2σ confidence) which when calibrated gives a date range of 13,730 to 13,550 cal BP.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  The Two Creeks radiocarbon dates are now regarded as a key result in developing the modern understanding of North American glaciation at the end of the Pleistocene.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

==== Dead Sea Scrolls ====
[[File:Great Isaiah Scroll Ch53.jpg|thumb|Part of the Great Isaiah Scroll, one of the Dead Sea Scrolls]]
In 1947, [[Dead Sea Scrolls|scrolls]] were discovered in caves near the [[Dead Sea]] that proved to contain writing in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], most of which are thought to have been produced by the [[Essenes]], a small Jewish sect.  These scrolls are of great significance in the study of Biblical texts because many of them contain the earliest known version of books of the Hebrew bible.&lt;ref name="taylor38"&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt; A sample of the linen wrapping from one of these scrolls, the [[Great Isaiah scroll|Great Isaiah Scroll]], was included in a 1955 analysis by Libby, with an estimated age of 1,917 ± 200 years.&lt;ref name="taylor38" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Libby (1965), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on an analysis of the writing style, [[Palaeography|palaeographic]] estimates were made of the age of 21 of the scrolls, and samples from most of these, along with other scrolls which had not been palaeographically dated, were tested by two AMS laboratories in the 1990s.  The results ranged in age from the early 4th century BC to the mid 4th century AD.  In all but two cases the scrolls were determined to be within 100 years of the palaeographically determined age.  The Isaiah scroll was included in the testing and was found to have two possible date ranges at a 2σ confidence level, because of the shape of the calibration curve at that point: there is a 15% chance that it dates from 355–295 BC, and an 84% chance that it dates from 210–45 BC.  Subsequently, these dates were criticized on the grounds that before the scrolls were tested, they had been treated with modern castor oil in order to make the writing easier to read; it was argued that failure to remove the castor oil sufficiently would have caused the dates to be too young.  Multiple papers have been published both supporting and opposing the criticism.&lt;ref name="taylor38" /&gt;

=== Impact ===
Soon after the publication of Libby's 1949 paper in ''Science'', universities around the world began establishing radiocarbon-dating laboratories, and by the end of the 1950s there were more than 20 active {{chem|14|C}} research laboratories.  It quickly became apparent that the principles of radiocarbon dating were valid, despite certain discrepancies, the causes of which then remained unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Bar-Yosef (2014), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of radiocarbon dating has had a profound impact on archaeology{{snd}}often described as the "radiocarbon revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1997), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the words of anthropologist R.&amp;nbsp;E. Taylor, "{{chem|14|C}} data made a ''world'' prehistory possible by contributing a time scale that transcends local, regional and continental boundaries". It provides more accurate dating within sites than previous methods, which usually derived either from stratigraphy or from typologies (e.g. of stone tools or pottery); it also allows comparison and synchronization of events across great distances. The advent of radiocarbon dating may even have led to better field methods in archaeology, since better data recording leads to firmer association of objects with the samples to be tested. These improved field methods were sometimes motivated by attempts to prove that a {{chem|14|C}} date was incorrect. Taylor also suggests that the availability of definite date information freed archaeologists from the need to focus so much of their energy on determining the dates of their finds, and led to an expansion of the questions archaeologists were willing to research. For example, from the 1970s questions about the evolution of human behaviour were much more frequently seen in archaeology.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Taylor (1987), pp. 143–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dating framework provided by radiocarbon led to a change in the prevailing view of how innovations spread through prehistoric Europe. Researchers had previously thought that many ideas spread by diffusion through the continent, or by invasions of peoples bringing new cultural ideas with them. As radiocarbon dates began to prove these ideas wrong in many instances, it became apparent that these innovations must sometimes have arisen locally. This has been described as a "second radiocarbon revolution", and with regard to British prehistory, archaeologist [[Richard J.C. Atkinson|Richard Atkinson]] has characterized the impact of radiocarbon dating as "radical&amp;nbsp;... therapy" for the "progressive disease of invasionism". More broadly, the success of radiocarbon dating stimulated interest in analytical and statistical approaches to archaeological data.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  Taylor has also described the impact of AMS, and the ability to obtain accurate measurements from very small samples, as ushering in a third radiocarbon revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew (2014), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, radiocarbon dating techniques date an object of popular interest, for example the [[Shroud of Turin]], a piece of linen cloth thought by some to bear an image of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion. Three separate laboratories [[Radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin|dated samples of linen from the Shroud in 1988]]; the results pointed to 14th-century origins, raising doubts about the shroud's authenticity as an alleged 1st-century relic.&lt;ref name=Currie_2004 /&gt;

Researchers have studied other radioactive isotopes created by cosmic rays to determine if they could also be used to assist in dating objects of archaeological interest; such isotopes include [[Helium-3|{{Chem|3|He}}]], [[Beryllium-10|{{Chem|10|Be}}]], [[Neon-21|{{Chem|21|Ne}}]], [[Aluminium-26|{{Chem|26|Al}}]], and [[Chlorine-36|{{Chem|36|Cl}}]].  With the development of AMS in the 1980s it became possible to measure these isotopes precisely enough for them to be the basis of useful dating techniques, which have been primarily applied to dating rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (2005), pp. 77–79.&lt;/ref&gt;  Naturally occurring radioactive isotopes can also form the basis of dating methods, as with [[K-Ar dating|potassium–argon dating]], [[argon–argon dating]], and [[Uranium–thorium dating|uranium series dating]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker (2005), pp. 57–77.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other dating techniques of interest to archaeologists include [[Thermoluminescence dating|thermoluminescence]], [[optically stimulated luminescence]], [[electron spin resonance]], and [[fission track dating]], as well as techniques that depend on annual bands or layers, such as [[dendrochronology]], [[tephrochronology]], and [[varve]] chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (2005), pp. 93–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ray&lt;!-- Please do not change to Raymond - it is unreferenced and incorrect - confirmed at OTRS 2016100910006885--&gt; Douglas Bradbury''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|æ|d|ˌ|b|ɛ|r|i}}; August 22, 1920{{spaced ndash}}June 5, 2012) was an American [[author]] and [[screenwriter]]. He worked in a variety of genres, including [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]], [[horror fiction|horror]], and [[mystery fiction]].

Widely known for his [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1953), and his science-fiction and horror-story collections, ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' (1950), ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'' (1951), and ''[[I Sing the Body Electric (short story collection)|I Sing the Body Electric]]'' (1969), Bradbury was one of the most celebrated 20th- and 21st-century American writers. While most of his best known work is in [[speculative fiction]], he also wrote in other genres, such as the coming-of-age novel ''[[Dandelion Wine]]'' (1957) and the fictionalized memoir ''[[Green Shadows, White Whale]]'' (1992).

Recipient of numerous awards, including a 2007 [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|Pulitzer Citation]], Bradbury also wrote and consulted on screenplays and television scripts, including ''[[Moby Dick (1956)|Moby Dick]]'' and ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]''. Many of his works were adapted to comic book, television, and film formats.

Upon his death in 2012, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Bradbury "the writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the literary mainstream".&lt;ref name="NYT-20120606"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jonas|first=Gerald|title=Ray Bradbury, Master of Science Fiction, Dies at 91|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/07/books/ray-bradbury-popularizer-of-science-fiction-dies-at-91.html|date=June 6, 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Ray Bradbury HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|left|Bradbury as a senior in high school, 1938]]
Bradbury was born on August 22, 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Greasley |editor-first=Philip A. |author=Society for the Study of Midwestern Literature |title=Dictionary of Midwestern Literature |volume=1, The Authors |year=2001 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=9780253336095 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnuYKJSoHCMC&amp;pg=PA77| accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Waukegan, Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;p.141 Bloom, Harold ''Ray Bradbury'' 2010 Infobase Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; to Esther ([[née]] Moberg) Bradbury (1888–1966), a [[Swedish American|Swedish immigrant]], and Leonard Spaulding Bradbury (1890–1957),&lt;ref&gt;Touponce, William F.

Although he was named after Rae Williams, a cousin on his father's side, Ray Bradbury's birth certificate spells his first name as "Ray".&lt;/ref&gt; He was given the middle name "Douglas" after the actor [[Douglas Fairbanks]]. Bradbury was related to the American [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] scholar Douglas Spaulding&lt;ref&gt;The Spaulding Family Memorial, 1899&lt;/ref&gt; and descended from [[Mary Bradbury]], who was tried at one of the [[Salem witch trials]] in 1692.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Jonathan|title=Becoming Ray Bradbury|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2011|page=202|isbn=0252036298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury was surrounded by an extended family during his early childhood and formative years in Waukegan. An aunt read him short stories when he was a child.&lt;ref&gt;Paradowski, Robert J. "Ray Bradbury". Critical Survey of Short Fiction, Second Revised Edition" 2001:1–5. EBSCO. November 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This period provided foundations for both the author and his stories. In Bradbury's works of fiction, 1920s Waukegan becomes "Green Town", Illinois.

The Bradbury family lived in [[Tucson, Arizona]], during 1926–1927 and 1932–1933 while their father pursued employment, each time returning to Waukegan. They eventually settled in Los Angeles in 1934 when Bradbury was 14 years old. The family arrived with only US$40, which paid for rent and food until his father finally found a job making wire at a cable company for $14 a week. This meant that they could stay, and Bradbury—who was in love with Hollywood—was ecstatic.&lt;!--TONE!--&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Bradbury attended [[Los Angeles High School]] and was active in the drama club. He often roller-skated through Hollywood in hopes of meeting celebrities. Among the creative and talented people Bradbury met were special-effects pioneer [[Ray Harryhausen]] and radio star [[George Burns]]. Bradbury's first pay as a writer, at age 14, was for a joke he sold to George Burns to use on the '' [[Burns and Allen]]'' radio show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/08/18/ray-bradbury-has-the-most-amazing-dreams-i-write-screenplays-he-says-with-a-wink-in-the-middle-of-the-night-when-he-wa/ Ray Bradbury's close encounters with W.C.

==Influences==

===Literature===
Throughout his youth, Bradbury was an avid reader and writer&lt;ref&gt;Litz, A. Walton. American Writers Supplement IV. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and knew at a young age that he was "going into one of the arts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury| title=Ray Bradbury, The Art of Fiction No. 203| last=Weller| first=Sam| date=2010-01-01| newspaper=Paris Review| issue=192| issn=0031-2037| access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury began writing his own stories at age 11 (1931), during the [[Great Depression]] — sometimes writing on the only available paper, butcher paper.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In his youth, he spent much time in the [[List of Carnegie libraries in Illinois|Carnegie library]] in Waukegan, reading such authors as [[H. G. Wells]], [[Jules Verne]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. At 12, Bradbury began writing traditional horror stories and said he tried to imitate Poe until he was about 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury|title=Ray Bradbury, The Art of Fiction No. 203|last=Weller|first=Sam|date=2010-01-01|newspaper=Paris Review| issue=192| issn=0031-2037| access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to comics, he loved [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], creator of ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary Authors Online. ''Ray Bradbury''. Detroit: Gale, 2009. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; especially Burroughs' [[John Carter of Mars]] series. ''[[The Warlord of Mars]]'' impressed him so much that at the age of 12, he wrote his own sequel.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Terry. Magill's Survey of American Literature. Revised Edition. Pasadena: Salem Press, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The young Bradbury was also a cartoonist and loved to illustrate. He wrote about Tarzan and drew his own Sunday panels. He listened to the radio show ''[[Chandu the Magician (radio)|Chandu the Magician]]'', and every night when the show went off the air, he would sit and write the entire script from memory.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

As a teen in Beverly Hills, he often visited his mentor and friend science-fiction writer [[Bob Olsen]], sharing ideas and maintaining contact. In 1936, at a secondhand bookstore in Hollywood, Bradbury discovered a handbill promoting meetings of the [[Los Angeles Science Fiction Society]].&lt;ref&gt;The article linked appears in the source, but this name conflicts with the group's web site.&lt;/ref&gt; Excited to find there were others sharing his interest, Bradbury joined a weekly Thursday-night conclave at age 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Big Read| url=http://www.neabigread.org/books/fahrenheit451/fahrenheit451_04.php| publisher=Neabigread.org| accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury cited H. G. Wells and Jules Verne as his primary science-fiction influences. Bradbury identified with Verne, saying, "He believes the human being is in a strange situation in a very strange world, and he believes that we can triumph by behaving morally".
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury Ray Bradbury interview – The art of Fiction No. 203] ''The Paris Review''; Spring, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury admitted that he stopped reading science-fiction books in his 20s and embraced a broad field of literature that included [[Alexander Pope]] and poet [[John Donne]].&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt; Bradbury had just graduated from high school when he met Robert Heinlein, then 31 years old. Bradbury recalled, "He was well known, and he wrote humanistic science fiction, which influenced me to dare to be human instead of mechanical."&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt;

In young adulthood Bradbury read stories published in ''Astounding Science Fiction'', and read everything by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and the early writings of [[Theodore Sturgeon]] and [[A. E. van Vogt]].

===Hollywood===
The family lived about four blocks from the Uptown Theater on Western Avenue in Los Angeles, the flagship theater for [[MGM]] and [[20th Century Fox|Fox]]. There, Bradbury learned how to sneak in and watched previews almost every week. He rollerskated there, as well as all over town, as he put it, "hell-bent on getting autographs from glamorous stars. It was glorious." Among stars the young Bradbury was thrilled to encounter were [[Norma Shearer]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], and [[Ronald Colman]]. Sometimes, he spent all day in front of [[Paramount Pictures]] or [[Columbia Pictures]] and then skated to the [[Brown Derby]] to watch the stars who came and went for meals. He recounted seeing [[Cary Grant]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], and [[Mae West]], whom he learned made a regular appearance every Friday night, bodyguard in tow.&lt;ref name="playboy"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.raybradbury.com/articles_playboy.html |title=About Ray Bradbury Interview|work=Playboy|year= 1996|author=Ken Kelley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury relates the following meeting with [[Sergei Bondarchuk]], director of Soviet epic film series ''[[War and Peace (film series)|War and Peace]]'', at a Hollywood award ceremony in Bondarchuk's honor:

{{quote|They formed a long queue and as Bondarchuk was walking along it he recognized several people: "Oh Mr. Ford, I like your film." He recognized the director, Greta Garbo, and someone else. I was standing at the very end of the queue and silently watched this. Bondarchuk shouted to me; "Ray Bradbury, is that you?" He rushed up to me, embraced me, dragged me inside, grabbed a bottle of [[Stolichnaya]], sat down at his table where his closest friends were sitting. All the famous Hollywood directors in the queue were bewildered. They stared at me and asked each other "Who is this Bradbury?" And, swearing, they left, leaving me alone with Bondarchuk...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbth.ru/articles/2012/06/06/ray_bradbury_russians_have_an_unparalleled_capacity_for_love_15822.html|title=Ray Bradbury: "Russians have an unparalleled capacity for love"|publisher=Russia Beyond The Headlines |website=www.rbth.ru|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Career==
[[File:Amazing stories 194412.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bradbury's "Undersea Guardians" was the cover story for the December 1944 issue of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'']]
Bradbury's first published story was "[[Hollerbochen's Dilemma]]", which appeared in the January 1938 number of [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest J. Ackerman's]] [[fanzine]] ''Imagination!''.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; In July 1939, Ackerman and his then-girlfriend [[Morojo]] gave 19-year-old Bradbury the money to head to New York for the [[1st World Science Fiction Convention|First World Science Fiction Convention]] in [[New York City]], and funded Bradbury's fanzine, titled ''[[Futuria Fantasia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raybradbury.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/000825.html Marguerite bradbury – Ray Bradbury Discussion] Ray Bradbury Official website&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury wrote most of its four issues, each limited to under 100 copies. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}Between 1940 and 1947, he was a contributor to [[Rob Wagner]]'s film magazine, ''Script''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury|title=Ray Bradbury, The Art of Fiction No. 203|work=The Paris Review|date=Spring 2010|author=Sam Weller }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury was free to start a career in writing, when owing to his bad eyesight, he was rejected admission into the military during [[World War II]]. Having been inspired by science-fiction heroes such as [[Flash Gordon]] and [[Buck Rogers]], Bradbury began to publish science-fiction stories in fanzines in 1938. Bradbury was invited by Forrest J. Ackerman {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} to attend the [[Los Angeles Science Fiction Society]], which at the time met at [[Clifton's Cafeteria]] in downtown Los Angeles. This was where he met the writers [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Emil Petaja]], [[Fredric Brown]], [[Henry Kuttner]], [[Leigh Brackett]], and [[Jack Williamson]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1939, Bradbury joined [[Laraine Day]]'s Wilshire Players Guild, where for two years, he wrote and acted in several plays. They were, as Bradbury later described, "so incredibly bad" that he gave up playwriting for two decades.&lt;ref name="bradbury1972"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Veldt|publisher=Dramatic Publishing|author=Bradbury, Ray|authorlink=Ray Bradbury| year=1972| location=Woodstock, Illinois|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YP_awFRqToC&amp;pg=PA4| page=4| isbn=1-58342-028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury's first paid piece, "Pendulum", written with Henry Hasse, was published in the pulp magazine ''Super Science Stories'' in November 1941, for which he earned $15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s9.com/Biography/Bradbury-Raymond-Douglas| title=Biographies: Bradbury, Raymond Douglas|publisher=s9.com|accessdate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury sold his first story, "The Lake", for $13.75 at 22, and became a full-time writer by 24.&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt; His first collection of short stories, ''[[Dark Carnival (short story collection)|Dark Carnival]]'', was published in 1947 by [[Arkham House]], a small press in [[Sauk City, Wisconsin]], owned by writer [[August Derleth]]. Reviewing ''Dark Carnival'' for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', [[Will Cuppy]] proclaimed Bradbury "suitable for general consumption" and predicted that he would become a writer of the caliber of British fantasy author [[John Collier (fiction writer)|John Collier]].&lt;ref&gt;Cuppy, Will, "Review of Dark Carnival," ''New York Herald Tribune Books'', May 25, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a rejection notice from the pulp ''[[Weird Tales]]'', Bradbury submitted "Homecoming" to ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', which was spotted by a young editorial assistant named [[Truman Capote]]. Capote picked the Bradbury manuscript from a slush pile, which led to its publication. ''Homecoming'' won a place in the [[O. Henry Award]] Stories of 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/ray-bradbury-from-truman-capote-to-a-t-m-s/ Ray Bradbury, From Truman Capote to A.T.M.’s], by Dean Robinson – 6th floor; ''The New York Times'', June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[UCLA]]'s [[Powell Library]], in a study room with typewriters for rent, Bradbury wrote his classic story of a [[book burning]] future, ''The Fireman'', which was about 25,000 words long. It was later published at about 50,000 words under the name ''Fahrenheit 451'', for a total cost of $9.80, due to the library's typewriter-rental fees of ten cents per half-hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A Bruin Birthday Tribute To Ray Bradbury Tweet|url=http://www.spotlight.ucla.edu/ray-bradbury/|title=First Spark: Ray Bradbury Turns 90; The Universe and UCLA Academy Celebrate|publisher=Spotlight.ucla.edu|date=August 22, 2010|accessdate=September 30, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005161805/http://www.spotlight.ucla.edu/ray-bradbury/|archivedate=October 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A chance encounter in a Los Angeles bookstore with the British expatriate writer [[Christopher Isherwood]] gave Bradbury the opportunity to put ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' into the hands of a respected critic. Isherwood's glowing review&lt;ref name="CI50"&gt;{{Citation| last=Isherwood| first=Christopher| author-link=Christopher Isherwood| title=A Review of ''The Martian Chronicles''| journal=Tomorrow| volume=10| pages=56–58| date=October 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed.

==Writing==
Bradbury attributed two incidents to his lifelong habit of writing every day. The first of these, occurring when he was three years old, was his mother's taking him to see [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]'s performance in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paradowski, Robert J. "Ray Bradbury." Critical Survey of Short Fiction, Second Revised Edition (2001): UFO. November 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The second incident occurred in 1932, when a carnival entertainer, one Mr. Electrico, touched the young man on the nose with an electrified sword, made his hair stand on end, and shouted, "Live forever!"&lt;ref name="IHW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raybradbury.com/inhiswords02.html|title=In His Words| publisher=RayBradbury.com| accessdate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury remarked, "I felt that something strange and wonderful had happened to me because of my encounter with Mr. Electrico...[he] gave me a future...I began to write, full-time. I have written every single day of my life since that day 69 years ago."&lt;ref name="IHW"/&gt; At that age, Bradbury first started to do [[Magic (illusion)|magic]], which was his first great love. If he had not discovered writing, he would have become a magician.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Sanders' film Ray Bradbury: Story of a Writer (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury claimed a wide variety of influences, and described discussions he might have with his favorite poets and writers [[Robert Frost]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[Aldous Huxley]], and [[Thomas Wolfe]]. From Steinbeck, he said he learned "how to write objectively and yet insert all of the insights without too much extra comment". He studied [[Eudora Welty]] for her "remarkable ability to give you atmosphere, character, and motion in a single line". Bradbury's favorite writers growing up included [[Katherine Anne Porter]], who wrote about the American South, [[Edith Wharton]], and [[Jessamyn West (writer)|Jessamyn West]].&lt;ref name="Paris Review"&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury The Art of Fiction No. 203: Ray Bradbury], Interviewed by Sam Weller; ''The Paris Review'', Spring 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury was once described as a "[[Midwest]] [[surrealism|surrealist]]" and is often labeled a science-fiction writer, which he described as "the art of the possible." Bradbury resisted that categorization, however:

{{quote|First of all, I don't write science fiction. I've only done one science fiction book and that's ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', based on reality. Science fiction is a depiction of the real. Fantasy is a depiction of the unreal. So ''[[Martian Chronicles]]'' is not science fiction, it's fantasy. It couldn't happen, you see? That's the reason it's going to be around a long time -- because it's a [[Greek myth]], and myths have staying power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Wil Gerken |author2=Nathan Hendler |author3=Doug Floyd |author4=John Banks |url=http://weeklywire.com/ww/09-27-99/alibi_feat1.html |title=Books: Grandfather Time (Weekly Alibi . 09-27-99) |publisher=Weeklywire.com |accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bradbury recounted when he came into his own as a writer, the afternoon he wrote a short story about his first encounter with death. When he was a boy, he met a young girl at the beach and she went out into the water and never came back. Years later, as he wrote about it, tears flowed from him. He recognized he had taken the leap from emulating the many writers he admired to connecting with his voice as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmolearning.com/videos/a-conversation-with-ray-bradbury-2001-1131/ A Conversation with Ray Bradbury] Point Loma Nazarene University, Writer's Symposium By The Sea; "The only science fiction I have written is ''Fahrenheit 451''.

I am a fantasy writer. But the label got put on me and stuck." March 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

When later asked about the lyrical power of his prose, Bradbury replied, "From reading so much poetry every day of my life. My favorite writers have been those who’ve said things well." He is quoted, "If you're reluctant to weep, you won't live a full and complete life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2012/06/personal_lessons_from_futurist.html Personal lessons from futurist Ray Bradbury on crying, escaping, laughing], by Mick Mortlock; Oregon Live, June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In high school, Bradbury was active in both the poetry club and the drama club, continuing plans to become an actor, but becoming serious about his writing as his high school years progressed. Bradbury graduated from Los Angeles High School, where he took poetry classes with Snow Longley Housh, and short-story writing courses taught by Jeannet Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceagecity.com/bradbury/bio.htm Ray Bradbury Biography] Ray Bradbury Online&lt;/ref&gt; The teachers recognized his talent and furthered his interest in writing,&lt;ref&gt;Litz, A. Walton, and Molly Weigel, eds. American Writers (Supp. 4, Pt. 1). New York: Macmillian Library Reference. 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not attend college. Instead, he sold newspapers at the corner of South Norton Avenue and Olympic Boulevard. In regard to his education, Bradbury said:
{{quote| Libraries raised me. I don't believe in colleges and universities. I believe in libraries because most students don't have any money. When I graduated from high school, it was during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] and we had no money. I couldn't go to college, so I went to the library three days a week for 10 years.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 2009-06-19"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Steinhauer|title=A Literary Legend Fights for a Local Library|date=June 19, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/us/20ventura.html|accessdate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lat-1988oct01&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-01/local/me-4256_1_central-library "Mayor, Author Launch Library Funding Drive"]. [[Los Angeles Times]], October 1, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He told ''[[The Paris Review]]'', "You can't learn to write in college. It's a very bad place for writers because the teachers always think they know more than you do – and they don’t."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury Ray Bradbury Interview] ''The Paris Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury described his inspiration as, "My stories run up and bite me in the leg -- I respond by writing them down -- everything that goes on during the bite. When I finish, the idea lets go and runs off".&lt;ref&gt;Garg, Anu, A  Word a Day, 2017.08.22, wordsmith.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Green Town"===
A reinvention of Waukegan, Green Town is a symbol of safety and home, which is often juxtaposed as a contrasting backdrop to tales of fantasy or menace. It serves as the setting of his semiautobiographical classics ''Dandelion Wine'', ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (novel)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'', and ''Farewell Summer'', as well as in many of his short stories. In Green Town, Bradbury's favorite uncle sprouts wings, traveling carnivals conceal supernatural powers, and his grandparents provide room and board to [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summer Morning, Summer Night by Ray Bradbury|url=https://subterraneanpress.com/store/product_detail/summer_morning_summer_night|website=Subterranean Press|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822143044/http://subterraneanpress.com/store/product_detail/summer_morning_summer_night|archivedate=August 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most definitive usage of the pseudonym for his hometown, in ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', a collection of short stories and vignettes exclusively about Green Town, Bradbury returns to the signature locale as a look back at the rapidly disappearing small-town world of the American heartland, which was the foundation of his roots.&lt;ref&gt;Sites from these works which still exist in Waukegan include his boyhood home, his grandparents' home next door (and their connecting lawns where  his grandfather and he gathered dandelions to make wine) and, less than a block away, the famous ravine which Bradbury used as a [[metaphor]] throughout his career.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural contributions==
Bradbury wrote many short essays on the culture and the arts, attracting the attention of critics in this field, but he used his fiction to explore and criticize his culture and society. Bradbury observed, for example, that ''Fahrenheit 451'' touches on the alienation of people by media:
{{quote|In writing the short novel ''Fahrenheit 451'' I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in [[Beverly Hills]] one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap opera cries, [[sleep walking]], helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by [[Kingsley Amis]] in ''New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction'' (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bradbury stated the novel worked as a critique of the later development of [[political correctness]]:
{{quote|How does the story of ''Fahrenheit 451'' stand up in 1994?&lt;br&gt;
R.B.: It works even better because we have political correctness now. Political correctness is the real enemy these days. The black groups want to control our thinking and you can’t say certain  things. The homosexual groups don’t want you to criticize them. It’s thought control and freedom of speech control.&lt;ref name="Conversations with Ray Bradbury"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gasior |first1=Ann |title=Bradbury Talk Likely to Feature the Unexpected |url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:168044/datastream/PDF/view |website=Florida State University Libraries |publisher=Dayton Daily News |accessdate=2 June 2018 |pages=104–105 |language=English |date=1 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 1982 essay, he wrote, "People ask me to predict the Future, when all I want to do is prevent it". This intent had been expressed earlier by other authors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/10/19/prevent-the-future/ |title=I Do Not Want to Predict the Future. I Want to Prevent It| publisher=Quote Investigator |accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who sometimes attributed it to him.

On May 24, 1956, Bradbury appeared on television in Hollywood on the popular quiz show ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' hosted by [[Groucho Marx]].  During his introductory comments and on-air banter with Marx, Bradbury briefly discussed some of his books and other works, including giving an overview of "[[The Veldt (short story)|The Veldt]]", his short story published six years earlier in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' under the title "The World the Children Made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBTrUx46b8I|title=You Bet Your Life #55-35 Science fiction author Ray Bradbury (Secret word 'House', May 24, 1956)|date=November 16, 2013|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury was a consultant for the American Pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nywf64.com/unista09.shtml|title=The American Journey|first=Ray |last=Bradbury}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the original exhibit housed in [[Epcot]]'s [[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|Spaceship Earth]] geosphere at [[Walt Disney World Resort|Walt Disney World]].&lt;ref name="Ray Bradbury, Spaceship Earth 1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ray Bradbury|title=In 1982 he created the interior metaphors for the Spaceship Earth display at Epcot Center, Disney World|url= http://www.raybradbury.com/bio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ray Bradbury, Spaceship Earth 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raybradbury.com/articles_town_talk.html|author=Ray Bradbury|title=The images at Spaceship Earth in DisneyWorld's EPCOT Center in Orlando?

"He also serves as a consultant, having collaborated, for example, in the design of a pavilion in the Epcot Center at Walt Disney World." Referring to Spaceship Earth&amp;nbsp;... [http://www.raybradbury.com/articles_book_mag.html raybradbury.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bradbury concentrated on detective fiction in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Litz, A. Walton., and Molly V. Weigel. American Writers: a Collection of Literary Biographies. New York: Scribner, 1996. Print&lt;/ref&gt;  In the latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s, he also hosted ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]'', a televised [[anthology series]] based on his short stories.

Bradbury was a strong supporter of public library systems, raising money to prevent the closure of several libraries in California facing budgetary cuts. He said "libraries raised me", and shunned colleges and universities, comparing his own lack of funds during the Depression with poor contemporary students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/us/20ventura.html|title=A Literary Legend Fights for a Local Library|date=June 19, 2009|accessdate=June 7, 2012|first=Jennifer|last=Steinhauer|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His opinion varied on modern technology. In 1985 Bradbury wrote, "I see nothing but good coming from computers. When they first appeared on the scene, people were saying, 'Oh my God, I'm so afraid.' I hate people like that – I call them the neo-[[Luddites]]", and "In a sense, [computers] are simply books. Books are all over the place, and computers will be, too".&lt;ref name="lemley19850108"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwjS--W2mG8C&amp;pg=PA133 | title=Other Voices, Other Futures | work=PC Magazine | date=January 8, 1985 | accessdate=October 28, 2013 | author=Lemley, Brad | page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resisted the conversion of his work into [[e-book]]s, saying in 2010, "We have too many cellphones. We've got too many internets. We have got to get rid of those machines. We have too many machines now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15968500|title=Fahrenheit 451 becomes e-book despite author's feelings|publisher=BBC News |date=November 30, 2011|accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the publishing rights for ''Fahrenheit 451'' came up for renewal in December 2011, Bradbury permitted its publication in electronic form provided that the publisher, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], allowed the e-book to be digitally downloaded by any library patron. The title remains the only book in the Simon &amp; Schuster catalog where this is possible.&lt;ref name="time obit"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/06/06/farenheit-451-author-ray-bradbury-dies-at-91/| title='Fahrenheit 451' Author Ray Bradbury Dies at 91| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=June 6, 2012|accessdate=June 6, 2012|first=Robert|last=Jablon|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608233645/http://entertainment.time.com/2012/06/06/farenheit-451-author-ray-bradbury-dies-at-91/| archivedate=June 8, 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several comic-book writers have adapted Bradbury's stories. Particularly noted among these were [[EC Comics]]' line of horror and science-fiction comics. Initially, the writers plagiarized his stories, but a diplomatic letter from Bradbury about it led to the company paying him and negotiating properly licensed adaptations of his work. The comics featuring Bradbury's stories included ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', ''Weird Science'', ''Weird Fantasy'', ''Crime Suspenstories'', and ''Haunt of Fear''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Bradbury remained an enthusiastic playwright all his life, leaving a rich theatrical legacy, as well as literary. Bradbury headed the Pandemonium Theatre Company in Los Angeles for many years and had a five-year relationship with the Fremont Centre Theatre in South Pasadena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-ray-bradbury-theater-20120606,0,3881510.story Ray Bradbury, 91, leaves a rich theatrical legacy too] by David Ng; Los Angeles Times, June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury is featured prominently in two documentaries related to his classic 1950s-1960s era: [[Jason V Brock]]'s ''Charles Beaumont: The Life of Twilight Zone's Magic Man'',&lt;ref&gt;French, Lawrence [http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2010/03/richard-matheson-remembers-his-good-friend-charles-beaumont/ "Richard Matheson remembers his good friend Charles Beaumont"], March 24, 2010.

Nolan]], as well as Brock's ''The AckerMonster Chronicles!'', which delves into the life of former Bradbury agent, close friend, mega-fan,&lt;!--TONE!--&gt; and ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]'' editor [[Forrest J Ackerman]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Bradbury's legacy was celebrated by the bookstore [[Fahrenheit 451 Books]] in Laguna Beach, California, in the 1970s and 1980s. The grand opening of an annex to the store was attended by Bradbury and his favorite illustrator, [[Joseph Mugnaini]], in the mid-1980s. The shop closed its doors in 1987, but in 1990, another shop with the same name (with different owners) opened in Carlsbad, California.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Riegert, ''Hidden Coast of California: The Adventurer's Guide'' (Berkeley, Cal.: Ulysses Press, 1988), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 90s, Bradbury served on the advisory board of the [[Los Angeles Student Film Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Editor|title=National Student Film Institute/L.A:  The Sixteenth Annual Los Angeles Student Film Festival|date=June 10, 1994|location=The Directors Guild Theatre|pages=10–11|accessdate=6 January 2018|ref=Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Editor|title=Los Angeles Student Film Institute: 13th Annual Student Film Festival|date=June 7, 1991|location=The Directors Guild Theatre|page=3|accessdate=6 January 2018|ref=Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Ray Bradbury 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|Bradbury in December 2009]]
Bradbury was married to Marguerite McClure (January 16, 1922&amp;nbsp;– November 24, 2003) from 1947 until her death; they had four daughters:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9315001/Ray-Bradbury.html |title=Telegraph obituary |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=June 6, 2012 |accessdate= June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan, Ramona, Bettina, and Alexandra.&lt;ref name="BBC dies"/&gt; Bradbury never obtained a [[driver's license]], but relied on public transportation or his bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Riddle |first=Warren |url=http://www.switched.com/2009/06/25/author-ray-bradbury-on-the-web-not-real-its-in-the-air-somew/ |title=Sci-Fi Author Ray Bradbury Trashes the Web |publisher=Switched |date=June 25, 2009 |accessdate=December 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001142931/http://www.switched.com/2009/06/25/author-ray-bradbury-on-the-web-not-real-its-in-the-air-somew/ |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived at home until he was 27 and married. His wife of 56 years, Maggie, as she was affectionately called, was the only woman Bradbury ever dated.&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt;

He was raised [[Baptist]] by his parents, who were themselves infrequent churchgoers. As an adult, Bradbury considered himself a "delicatessen religionist" who resisted categorization of his beliefs and took guidance from both Eastern and Western faiths. He felt that his career was "a God-given thing, and I'm so grateful, so, so grateful. The best description of my career as a writer is 'At play in the fields of the Lord.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/08/02/Bradbury/index.html| title=Sci-fi legend Ray Bradbury on God, 'monsters and angels'| publisher=CNN| date=August 2, 2010| accessdate=October 14, 2015| first=John| last=Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury was a close friend of [[Charles Addams]], and Addams illustrated the first of Bradbury's stories about the Elliotts, a family that resembled Addams' own [[Addams Family]] placed in rural [[Illinois]]. Bradbury's first story about them was "Homecoming", published in the 1946 Halloween issue of ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', with Addams' illustrations. Addams and he planned a larger collaborative work that would tell the family's complete history, but it never materialized, and according to a 2001 interview, they went their separate ways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiebound.org/author-interviews/bradburyray Interview with Ray Bradbury] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203203807/http://www.indiebound.org/author-interviews/bradburyray |date=February 3, 2009 }} in ''IndieBound'', fall 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2001, Bradbury published all the Family stories he had written in one book with a connecting narrative, ''[[From the Dust Returned]]'', featuring a wraparound Addams cover of the original "Homecoming" illustration.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, Ray, ''From The Dust Returned: A Novel''. William Morrow, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another close friend was animator [[Ray Harryhausen]], who was [[best man]] at Bradbury's wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Whitaker |first=Sheila |title=Ray Harryhausen obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/07/ray-harryhausen-dies |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=May 7, 2013 |accessdate=June 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a [[BAFTA]] 2010 awards tribute in honor of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s 90th birthday, Bradbury spoke of his first meeting Harryhausen at Forrest J Ackerman's house when they were both 18 years old. Their shared love for science fiction, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', and the [[King Vidor]]-directed film ''[[The Fountainhead (film)|The Fountainhead]]'', written by [[Ayn Rand]], was the beginning of a lifelong friendship. These early influences inspired the pair to believe in themselves and affirm their career choices.

Late in life, Bradbury retained his dedication and passion despite what he described as the "devastation of illnesses and deaths of many good friends." Among the losses that deeply grieved Bradbury was the death of ''[[Star Trek]]'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]], who was an intimate friend for many years. They remained close friends for nearly three decades after Roddenberry asked him to write for ''Star Trek'', which Bradbury never did, objecting that he "never had the ability to adapt other people's ideas into any sensible form."&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt;

==Bibliography==
[[File:Planet stories 195311.jpg|thumb|upright|Bradbury's "The Golden Apples of the Sun" was published in the November 1953 issue of ''[[Planet Stories]]''.]]
{{Main|Ray Bradbury bibliography|Ray Bradbury short fiction bibliography}}
Bradbury is credited with writing 27 novels and over 600 short stories.&lt;ref name="latimes obit"/&gt; More than eight million copies of his works, published in over 36 languages, have been sold around the world.&lt;ref name="NYT-20120606"/&gt;

===First novel===
In 1949, Bradbury and his wife were expecting their first child. He took a Greyhound bus to New York and checked into a room at the YMCA for 50 cents a night. He took his short stories to a dozen publishers and no one wanted them. Just before getting ready to go home, Bradbury had dinner with an editor at Doubleday. When Bradbury recounted that everyone wanted a novel and he did not have one, the editor, coincidentally named Walter Bradbury, asked if the short stories might be tied together into a book-length collection. The title was the editor's idea; he suggested, "You could call it ''The Martian Chronicles''." Bradbury liked the idea and recalled making notes in 1944 to do a book set on Mars. That evening, he stayed up all night at the YMCA and typed out an outline. He took it to the Doubleday editor the next morning, who read it and wrote Bradbury a check for $750. When Bradbury returned to Los Angeles, he connected all the short stories that became ''The Martian Chronicles.''&lt;ref name="Paris Review"/&gt;

===Intended first novel===
What was later issued as a collection of stories and vignettes, ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', started out to be Bradbury's first true novel. The core of the work was Bradbury's witnessing of the American small-town life in the American heartland.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the winter of 1955–56, after a consultation with his Doubleday editor, Bradbury deferred publication of a novel based on Green Town, the pseudonym for his hometown. Instead, he extracted 17 stories and, with three other Green Town tales, bridged them into his 1957 book ''Dandelion Wine''. Later, in 2006, Bradbury published the original novel remaining after the extraction, and retitled it ''Farewell Summer''. These two titles show what stories and episodes Bradbury decided to retain as he created the two books out of one.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The most significant of the remaining unpublished stories, scenes, and fragments were published under the originally intended name for the novel, ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pspublishing.co.uk/dandelion-wine-50th-anniversary-ed-signed-2-vol-sc-by-ray-bradbury--stephen-king-out-of-print-1022-p.asp Summer Morning, Summer Night], by Ray Bradbury; PS Publishing, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations to other media==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
[[File:Ray Bradbury 1959.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Bradbury in 1959, when some of his short stories were adapted for television shows like ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'']]
From 1950 to 1954, 31 of Bradbury's stories were adapted by [[Al Feldstein]] for [[EC Comics]] (seven of them uncredited in six stories, including "Kaleidoscope" and "Rocket Man" being combined as "Home To Stay" - for which Bradbury was retroactively paid - and EC's first version of "The Handler" under the title "A Strange Undertaking") and 16 of these were collected in the paperbacks, ''[[The Autumn People]]'' (1965) and ''[[Tomorrow Midnight]]'' (1966), both published by [[Ballantine Books]] with cover illustrations by [[Frank Frazetta]].
Also in the early 1950s, adaptations of Bradbury's stories were televised in several anthology shows, including ''[[Tales of Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Lights Out (radio show)|Lights Out]]'', ''Out There'', ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'', ''[[CBS Television Workshop]]'', ''[[Fireside Theater|Jane Wyman's Fireside Theatre]]'', ''[[Star Tonight]]'', ''Windows'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. "The Merry-Go-Round", a half-hour film adaptation of Bradbury's "The Black Ferris", praised by ''Variety'', was shown on ''Starlight Summer Theater'' in 1954 and NBC's ''Sneak Preview'' in 1956. During that same period, several stories were adapted for radio drama, notably on the science fiction anthologies ''[[Dimension X (radio program)|Dimension X]]'' and its successor ''[[X Minus One]]''.

[[File:Rhedosaurus &amp; the lighthouse.png|thumb|left|Scene from ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'', based on Bradbury's ''[[The Fog Horn]]'']]

Producer [[William Alland]] first brought Bradbury to movie theaters in 1953 with ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]'', a [[Harry Essex]] screenplay developed from Bradbury's screen treatment "Atomic Monster". Three weeks later came the release of Eugène Lourié's ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953), which featured one scene based on Bradbury's "[[The Fog Horn]]", about a sea monster mistaking the sound of a fog horn for the mating cry of a female. Bradbury's close friend Ray Harryhausen produced the stop-motion animation of the creature. Bradbury later returned the favor by writing a short story, "Tyrannosaurus Rex", about a stop-motion animator who strongly resembled Harryhausen. Over the next 50 years, more than 35 features, shorts, and TV movies were based on Bradbury's stories or screenplays.
Bradbury was hired in 1953 by director [[John Huston]] to work on the screenplay for his film version of [[Herman Melville|Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'' (1956), which stars [[Gregory Peck]] as Captain Ahab, [[Richard Basehart]] as Ishmael, and [[Orson Welles]] as Father Mapple. A significant result of the film was Bradbury's book ''[[Green Shadows, White Whale]]'', a semifictionalized account of the making of the film, including Bradbury's dealings with Huston and his time in Ireland, where exterior scenes that were set in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], were filmed.

Bradbury's short story ''I Sing the Body Electric'' (from the book of the same name) was adapted for the [[I Sing the Body Electric (The Twilight Zone)|100th episode of ''The Twilight Zone'']]. The episode was first aired on May 18, 1962.

In 1965, three of Bradbury's stories were adapted for the stage. These included "The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit", "The Day It Rained Forever", and "Device Out of Time". The last was adapted from his 1957 novel ''Dandelion Wine''. The plays debuted at the Coronet Theater in Hollywood and featured [[Booth Coleman]], [[Joby Baker]], Fredric Villani, Arnold Lessing, Eddie Sallia, [[Keith Taylor (actor)|Keith Taylor]], [[Richard Bull (actor)|Richard Bull]], Gene Otis Shane, Henry T. Delgado, [[F. Murray Abraham]], Anne Loos, and [[Len Lesser]]. The director was Charles Rome Smith and the production company was Pandemonium Productions.

[[Oskar Werner]] and [[Julie Christie]] starred in ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1966), an adaptation of Bradbury's novel directed by [[François Truffaut]].

In 1966, Bradbury helped [[Lynn Garrison]] create ''AVIAN'', a specialist aviation magazine. For the first issue, Bradbury wrote a poem, "Planes That Land on Grass".

In 1969, ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'' was brought to the big screen, starring [[Rod Steiger]], [[Claire Bloom]], and [[Robert Drivas]]. Containing the prologue and three short stories from the book, the film received mediocre reviews. The same year, Bradbury approached composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who had worked with Bradbury in dramatic radio of the 1950s and later scored the [[The Illustrated Man (film)|film version]], to compose a [[cantata]] ''[[Christus Apollo]]'' based on Bradbury's text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |last=Goldsmith |first=Jerry |date=2002 |title=Jerry Goldsmith: Christus Apollo |type=CD |publisher=[[Telarc International Corporation|Telarc]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work premiered in late 1969, with the [[California Chamber Symphony]] performing with narrator [[Charlton Heston]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].

''[[The Martian Chronicles (TV miniseries)|The Martian Chronicles]]'' became a three-part TV [[miniseries]] starring [[Rock Hudson]], which was first broadcast by [[NBC]] in 1980. Bradbury found the miniseries "just boring".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Sam|last=Weller|title=The Bradbury Chronicles: The Life of Ray Bradbury|location=New York| publisher=HarperCollins| year=2005| pages=301–302| isbn=0-06-054581-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1982 television movie ''[[The Electric Grandmother]]'' was based on Bradbury's short story "I Sing the Body Electric".

The 1983 horror film ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (film)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'', starring [[Jason Robards]] and [[Jonathan Pryce]], is based on the Bradbury novel of the [[Something Wicked This Way Comes (novel)|same name]].

In 1984, Michael McDonough of Brigham Young University produced "[[Bradbury 13]]", a series of 13 audio adaptations of famous stories from Bradbury, in conjunction with National Public Radio. The full-cast dramatizations featured adaptations of "The Ravine", "Night Call, Collect", "[[The Veldt (short story)|The Veldt]]", "There Was an Old Woman", "Kaleidoscope", "[[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed]]", "The Screaming Woman", "[[A Sound of Thunder]]", "The Man", "The Wind", "The Fox and the Forest", "[[Here There Be Tygers]]", and "The Happiness Machine". Voiceover actor [[Paul Frees]] provided narration, while Bradbury was responsible for the opening voiceover; Greg Hansen and Roger Hoffman scored the episodes. The series won a [[Peabody Award]] and two Gold Cindy awards, and was released on CD on May 1, 2010. The series began airing on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] on June 12, 2011.

From 1985 to 1992, Bradbury hosted a [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] anthology television series, ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]'', for which he adapted 65 of his stories. Each episode began with a shot of Bradbury in his office, gazing over mementoes of his life, which he states (in narrative) are used to spark ideas for stories. During the first two seasons, Bradbury also provided additional voiceover narration specific to the featured story and appeared on screen.

Deeply respected in the [[USSR]], Bradbury's fiction has been adapted into five episodes of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] science-fiction TV series ''This Fantastic World'' which adapted the stories film version of "I Sing The Body Electric", ''Fahrenheit 451'', "A Piece of Wood", "To the Chicago Abyss", and "Forever and the Earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtrf.ru/|title=State fund of Television and Radio Programs|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 a cartoon adaptation of [[There Will Come Soft Rains (short story)|There Will Come Soft Rains]] («Будет ласковый дождь») came out by [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] director Nazim Tyuhladziev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinomaniac.ru/movie.php?id=1366|script-title=ru:Будет ласковый дождь|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909130617/http://www.kinomaniac.ru/movie.php?id=1366|archivedate=September 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a film adaptation of [[The Veldt (film)|''The Veldt'' in 1987]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raybradbury.ru/video-stage/video/the_veldt/|script-title=ru:"Вельд", Киностудия "Узбекфильм", 1987|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, a cartoon adaptation of "[[Here There Be Tygers]]" («Здесь могут водиться тигры») by director Vladimir Samsonov came out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Мультипликационные фильмы|url=http://mebu.ru/stf/catalog.php?fl=1&amp;letter=%c7|website=Творческое объединение «Экран»|accessdate=14 August 2015|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury wrote and narrated the 1993 animated television version of ''[[The Halloween Tree (1993 TV film)|The Halloween Tree]]'', based on [[The Halloween Tree|his 1972 novel]].

The 1998 film ''[[The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit]]'', released by [[Touchstone Pictures]], was written by Bradbury. It was based on his story "The Magic White Suit" originally published in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' in 1957. The story had also previously been adapted as a play, a musical, and a 1958 television version.

In 2002, Bradbury's own Pandemonium Theatre Company production of ''Fahrenheit 451'' at Burbank's Falcon Theatre combined live acting with projected digital animation by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20050827043730/http://sromagazine.biz/mag/one_hot_stage/index.html Pixel Pups].

In 2005, the film ''[[A Sound of Thunder (film)|A Sound of Thunder]]'' was released, loosely based upon the short story of the same name. The film ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'' revolves around the same theory as ''A Sound of Thunder'' and contains many references to its inspiration. Short film adaptations of ''A Piece of Wood'' and ''[[The Small Assassin]]'' were released in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

In 2005, it was reported that Bradbury was upset with filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] for using the title ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', which is an allusion to Bradbury's ''Fahrenheit 451'', for his documentary about the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]]. Bradbury expressed displeasure with Moore's use of the title, but stated that his resentment was not politically motivated,  though Bradbury was [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative-leaning]] politically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/301992/ray-bradbury-great-conservative-john-fund|title=Ray Bradbury, a Great Conservative|publisher=Nationalreview.com|date=June 6, 2012|author=Fund, John|accessdate=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury asserted that he did not want any of the money made by the movie, nor did he believe that he deserved it. He pressured Moore to change the name, but to no avail. Moore called Bradbury two weeks before the film's release to apologize, saying that the film's marketing had been set in motion a long time ago and it was too late to change the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Sam|last=Weller|title=The Bradbury Chronicles: The Life of Ray Bradbury|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2005|pages=330–331|isbn=0-06-054581-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the film ''[[Ray Bradbury's Chrysalis]]'' was produced by Roger Lay Jr. for Urban Archipelago Films, based upon the short story of the same name. The film won the best feature award at the International Horror and Sci-Fi Film Festival in Phoenix. The film has international distribution by Arsenal Pictures and domestic distribution by Lightning Entertainment.

In 2010, ''The Martian Chronicles'' was adapted for radio by ''Colonial Radio Theatre on the Air''.

Bradbury's works and approach to writing are documented in [[Terry Sanders]]' film ''Ray Bradbury: Story of a Writer'' (1963).

'''Repurposing''' is the process by which an object with one [[use value]] is transformed or redeployed as an object with an alternative use value.

==Description==
Repurposing is as old as [[human civilization]], with many contemporary scholars investigating that way that different societies re-appropriate the artifacts of older cultures in new and creative ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/04/medieval-recycling/ | title=Medieval Recycling | publisher=Harvard Gazette | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, repurposing has been celebrated by 21st century hobbyists and arts-and-crafts organizations such as [[Instructables]] and other [[Maker culture]] communities as a means of creatively responding to the ecological and economic crises of the 21st century.  Recent scholarship has attempted to relate these activities to American left- and right-[[libertarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Malewitz, R. (2014) {{cite web | url=http://www-sup.stanford.edu/book.cgi?id=22814 | title=The Practice of Misuse | publisher=Stanford University Press | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-sup.stanford.edu/book.cgi?id=3195 | title=Throwaways: Work Culture and Consumer Education | publisher=Stanford University Press | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repurposing is the use of a tool being re-channeled into being another tool, usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool-maker. Typically, repurposing is done using items usually considered to be junk, garbage, or obsolete. A good example of this would be the [[Earthship]] style of house, that uses tires as insulating walls and bottles as glass walls. Reuse is not limited to repeated uses for the same purpose.  Examples of repurposing include using tires as [[boat fender]]s and [[steel drum]]s or plastic drums as [[feeding trough]]s and/or composting bins. [[Incinerator]] and power plant exhaust stack [[fly-ash]] is used extensively as an [[concrete additive|additive to concrete]], providing increased strength. This type of reuse can sometimes make use of items which are no longer usable for their original purposes, for example using worn-out clothes as [[Textile|rags]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diyncrafts.com/6081/repurpose/100-ways-repurpose-reuse-broken-household-items | title=100 Ways to Repurpose and Reuse Broken Household Items | publisher=DIY &amp; Crafts | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all repurposing is necessarily environmentally friendly, take for instance the idea of repurposing older work trucks for businesses in their infancy, in which their poor fuel economy can negate long term benefits since greater spending of money for fuel, and more fumes output to the sky can prove to be environmentally unfriendly, in which repurposing vehicles for [[Electric vehicle conversion|electric car conversion]] can be the recommended alternative to that, though its cost can be negligible upfront.

==Examples==

[[File:WestBankCowbell.jpg|thumb|An improvised [[cowbell]], used for sheep or goats. The bell was found in 1988 in a field near [[Tuqu']] (Tekoa) in the Judean hills, the West Bank. The bell's body is made of aluminum, probably a broken kitchen utensil, while the clapper is a brass cartridge case (SMI 25 NATO, probably 7.62×51mm).]]

===Automobiles===
*[[Full-size van]]s from the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] which have been used for airport shuttle service have been repurposed as church vans mainly because of some [[depreciation]] to facilitate affordable cost for thrifty church groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/200401/200401_54_sb6_vans.cfm | title=What Church Leaders Should Know About Church Vans | publisher=Enrichment Journal | accessdate=3 August 2014 | author=Hammar, Richard R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronics===
*A [[USB dead drop]] can be mounted on a [[brick wall]] since this gives an opportunity to repurpose older USB flash drives with obsolete capacities to continue service for file transfer (especially anonymous ones) that don't demand more than one [[gigabyte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deaddrops.com/dead-drops/participate/ |title=How to make your own |publisher=Deaddrops.com |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Everdrive]] and other flash video game cartridges have offered opportunities to download [[ROM image]]s of video game cartridges onto [[SD card]]s while offering opportunities to repurpose real vintage video game consoles for retro gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130329014653/http://www.stoneagegamer.com/mega-everdrive-deluxe.html Stoneagegamer's article on the Everdrive]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Old Android smartphones, which tend to have little computing resources yet which are unused and probably contain a triaxial [[accelerometer]] of decent specifications, can be used as an amateur seismograph node for a distributed seismography project, e.g., [[Quake-Catcher Network]].
*Discarded or new consumer COTS surplus parabolic reflectors intended for use for C band satellite TV reception can be repurposed for a wide gamut of applications for which a consumer-grade reflector of low gain is adequate, incl. amateur microwave SETI (mainly [[Project Argus]]), Wi-Fi links, and microwave [[amateur radio]] [[radio beacons]].

===As a tactic for manufacturing goods===
* [[Right-hand-drive]] [[Jeep]] brand vehicles, such as the [[Jeep Wrangler]], which are initially slated for import to right-hand-drive countries, have had some specially designed versions repurposed for US and Canada [[postal service]] mail carrying, in which this tactic of repurposing can consolidate the overhead of retooling for specialty manufacturing of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rightdrivejeeps4postal.com/ US Drive Right: The Nation's Largest Seller Of Used Factory
Right Hand Drive Vehicles For Postal Carriers&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing of recycled goods===
*[[Reusable packaging]] can be reused for a wide variety of other purposes.
* [[Recycling]] can also involve repurposing of materials, such as products using [[recycled paper]].&lt;ref name="debunking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Debunking the Myths of Recycled Paper|url=http://recyclingpoint.com.sg/Articles/feb1992myth_of_recycledpaper.htm|publisher=Recycling Point Dot Com|accessdate=4 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006094659/http://www.recyclingpoint.com.sg/Articles/feb1992myth_of_recycledpaper.htm |archivedate = 6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rights}}

'''Rights''' are [[law|legal]], social, or [[ethics|ethical]] [[principle]]s of [[Liberty|freedom]] or [[entitlement]]; that is, rights are the fundamental [[normative]] rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt; Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as [[law]] and [[ethics]], especially theories of [[justice]] and [[deontology]].
 
Rights are often considered fundamental to [[civilization]], for they are regarded as established pillars of [[society]] and [[culture]],&lt;ref&gt;UN [[UDHR]] Preamble: "Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world..."&lt;/ref&gt; and the history of [[social conflict]]s can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "rights structure the form of [[government]]s, the content of [[laws]], and the shape of [[morality]] as it is currently perceived".&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt;

==Definitional issues==
[[File:RNC 04 protest 89.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Street protest scene; people deliberately lying down on a busy city street, surrounded by onlookers and police|Rights are widely regarded as the basis of law, but what if laws are bad? Some theorists suggest [[civil disobedience]] is, itself, a ''right'', and it was advocated by thinkers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]].]]
There is considerable disagreement about what is meant precisely by the term ''rights''. It has been used by different groups and thinkers for different purposes, with different and sometimes opposing definitions, and the precise definition of this principle, beyond having something to do with normative rules of some sort or another, is controversial.

One way to get an idea of the multiple understandings and senses of the term is to consider different ways it is used. Many diverse things are claimed as rights: {{cquote|A right to life, a right to choose; a right to vote, to work, to strike; a right to one phone call, to dissolve parliament, to operate a forklift, to asylum, to equal treatment before the law, to feel proud of what one has done; a right to exist, to sentence an offender to death, to launch a nuclear first strike, to carry a concealed weapon, to a distinct genetic identity; a right to believe one's own eyes, to pronounce the couple husband and wife, to be left alone, to go to hell in one's own way.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg&gt;{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = Rights dominate most modern understandings of what actions are proper and which institutions are just. Rights structure the forms of our governments, the contents of our laws, and the shape of morality as we perceive it. To accept a set of rights is to approve a distribution of freedom and authority, and so to endorse a certain view of what may, must, and must not be done.

|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/
|accessdate = 2009-12-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are likewise diverse possible ways to categorize rights, such as:
{{cquote|''Who'' is alleged to have the right: Children's rights, animal rights, workers' rights, states' rights, the rights of peoples. ''What actions or states or objects'' the asserted right pertains to: Rights of free expression, to pass judgment; rights of privacy, to remain silent; property rights, bodily rights. ''Why'' the rightholder (allegedly) has the right: Moral rights spring from moral reasons, legal rights derive from the laws of the society, customary rights are aspects of local customs. ''How the asserted right can be affected'' by the rightholder's actions: The inalienable right to life, the forfeitable right to liberty, and the waivable right that a promise be kept.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt;}}
There has been considerable debate about what this term means within the academic community, particularly within fields such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[deontology]], [[logic]], [[political science]], and [[religion]].

===Natural versus legal===
[[File:Brueghel Jan II God creating.jpg|thumb|right|alt=painting of dark gray skies with trees and water, and a human image, flying, with arms outstretched|According to some views, certain rights derive from [[deities]] or [[nature]]]]
{{Main|Natural and legal rights}}
* '''Natural rights''' are rights which are "natural" in the sense of "not artificial, not man-made", as in rights deriving from [[human nature]] or from the [[divine command theory|edicts of a god]]. They are universal; that is, they apply to all people, and do not derive from the laws of any specific society. They exist necessarily, inhere in every individual, and can't be taken away. For example, it has been argued that humans have a natural ''right to life''. These are sometimes called ''[[natural and legal rights|moral rights]]'' or ''inalienable rights''.
* '''Legal rights''', in contrast, are based on a society's customs, laws, [[statute]]s or actions by [[legislature]]s. An example of a legal right is the ''right to vote'' of citizens. [[Citizenship]], itself, is often considered as the basis for having legal rights, and has been defined as the "right to have rights". Legal rights are sometimes called ''[[civil rights]]'' or ''statutory rights'' and are culturally and politically [[moral relativism|relative]] since they depend on a specific societal context to have meaning.

Some thinkers see rights in only one sense while others accept that both senses have a measure of validity. There has been considerable philosophical debate about these senses throughout history. For example, [[Jeremy Bentham]] believed that legal rights were the essence of rights, and he denied the existence of natural rights; whereas [[Thomas Aquinas]] held that rights purported by [[positive law]] but not grounded in [[natural law]] were not properly rights at all, but only a facade or pretense of rights.

===Claim versus liberty===
[[File:Chorin deed 1273.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a deed which has hand-written writing on a yellowed piece of paper with three gold tassles at the bottom|A [[deed]] is an example of a ''claim right'' in the sense that it asserts a ''right'' to own land. This particular deed dates back to 1273.]]
{{Main|Claim rights and liberty rights}}
* A '''claim right''' is a right which entails that another person has a duty to the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain from doing something to or for the ''claim holder'', such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a ''claim'' to that service or product (another term is ''[[thing in action]]'').&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;Fagan, Andrew. "Human Rights". ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH3b&lt;/ref&gt; In logic, this idea can be expressed as: "Person ''A'' has a claim that person ''B'' do something if and only if ''B'' has a duty to ''A'' to do that something." Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like "life, liberty, and property"; these rights impose an obligation upon others ''not'' to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be provided with those services.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* A '''liberty right''' or ''privilege'', in contrast, is simply a freedom or permission for the right-holder to do something, and there are ''no obligations'' on other parties to do or not do anything.&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt; This can be expressed in logic as: "Person ''A'' has a privilege to do something if and only if ''A'' has no duty not to do that something." For example, if a person has a legal liberty right to free speech, that merely means that it is not legally forbidden for them to speak freely: it does ''not'' mean that anyone has to help enable their speech, or to listen to their speech; or even, per se, refrain from stopping them from speaking, though ''other'' rights, such as the claim right to be free from assault, may severely limit what others can do to stop them.

Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so. Likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, then that other person's liberty is limited. For example, a person has a ''liberty right'' to walk down a sidewalk and can decide freely whether or not to do so, since there is no obligation either to do so or to refrain from doing so. But pedestrians may have an obligation not to walk on certain lands, such as other people's private property, to which those other people have a claim right. So a person's ''liberty right'' of walking extends precisely to the point where another's ''claim right'' limits his or her freedom.

===Positive versus negative===
{{Main|Negative and positive rights}}
In one sense, a right is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific service or treatment from others, and these rights have been called ''positive rights''. However, in another sense, rights may allow or require inaction, and these are called ''negative rights''; they permit or require doing nothing. For example, in some countries, e.g. the [[United States]], citizens have the ''positive right'' to vote and they have the ''negative right'' to not vote; people can choose not to vote in a given election without punishment. In other countries, e.g. [[Australia]], however, citizens have a positive right to vote but they don't have a negative right to not vote, since [[compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]]. Accordingly:
* '''Positive rights''' are permissions to do things, or entitlements to be done unto. One example of a positive right is the purported "right to welfare."&lt;ref name=tws21decgkfjf/&gt;
* '''Negative rights''' are permissions not to do things, or entitlements to be left alone. Often the distinction is invoked by [[libertarianism|libertarians]] who think of a ''negative right'' as an entitlement to non-interference such as a right against being assaulted.&lt;ref name=tws21decgkfjf&gt;{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = A distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among some normative theorists, especially those with a bent toward libertarianism. The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right.
|publisher = ''Stanford University''
|date = July 9, 2007
|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/
|accessdate = 2009-12-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though similarly named, positive and negative rights should not be confused with ''active rights'' (which encompass "privileges" and "powers") and ''passive rights'' (which encompass "claims" and "immunities").

===Individual versus group===
{{Main|Individual and group rights}}
The general concept of rights is that they are possessed by individuals in the sense that they are permissions and entitlements to do things which other persons, or which governments or authorities, can not infringe. This is the understanding of people such as the author [[Ayn Rand]] who argued that only individuals have rights, according to her philosophy known as [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].&lt;ref name=tws18decafafa&gt;{{cite news
|author = Ayn Rand
|title = The Virtue of Selfishness: Individual Rights
|quote = Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual). see page 104. See also: [[Group rights#Objectivist view|Collectivized 'Rights]]
|publisher = ''The Ayn Rand Lexicon''
|date = 2009-12-18
|url = http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html
|accessdate = 2009-12-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have argued that there are situations in which a group of persons is thought to have rights, or ''group rights''. Accordingly:
* '''Individual rights''' are rights held by individual people regardless of their group membership or lack thereof.
[[File:Malian Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Soldiers lined up in a row, with green caps, carrying rifles|Do groups have ''rights''? Some argue that when soldiers bond in [[combat]], the group becomes like an organism in itself and has ''rights'' which trump the rights of any individual soldier.]]
* '''Group rights''' have been argued to exist when a group is seen as more than a mere composite or assembly of separate individuals but an entity in its own right. In other words, it's possible to see a group as a distinct being in and of itself; it's akin to an enlarged individual, a corporate body, which has a distinct will and power of action and can be thought of as having ''rights''. For example, a platoon of soldiers in [[combat]] can be thought of as a distinct group, since individual members are willing to risk their lives for the survival of the group, and therefore the group can be conceived as having a "right" which is superior to that of any individual member; for example, a soldier who disobeys an officer can be punished, perhaps even killed, for a breach of obedience.  But there is another sense of group rights in which people who are members of a group can be thought of as having specific individual rights because of their membership in a group. In this sense, the set of rights which individuals-as-group-members have is expanded because of their membership in a group. For example, workers who are members of a group such as a [[Trade union|labor union]] can be thought of as having expanded individual rights because of their membership in the labor union, such as the rights to specific working conditions or wages. As expected, there is sometimes considerable disagreement about what exactly is meant by the term "group" as well as by the term "group rights."{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

There can be tension between individual and group rights. A classic instance in which group and individual rights clash is conflicts between unions and their members. For example, individual members of a union may wish a wage higher than the union-negotiated wage, but are prevented from making further requests; in a so-called [[closed shop]] which has a [[union security agreement]], only the union has a ''right'' to decide matters for the individual union members such as wage rates. So, do the supposed "individual rights" of the workers prevail about the proper wage? Or do the "group rights" of the union regarding the proper wage prevail? Clearly this is a source of tension.

The [[Austrian School|Austrian School of Economics]] holds that only individuals think, feel, and act whether or not members of any abstract group. The society should thus according to economists of the school be analyzed starting from the individual. This methodology is called [[methodological individualism]] and is used by the economists to justify [[individual rights]].

===Other senses===
Other distinctions between rights draw more on historical association or [[family resemblance]] than on precise philosophical distinctions. These include the distinction between '''[[civil and political rights]]''' and '''[[economic, social and cultural rights]]''', between which the articles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] are often divided. Another conception of rights groups them into '''[[three generations of human rights|three generations]]'''. These distinctions have much overlap with that between [[negative and positive rights]], as well as between [[individual rights]] and [[group rights]], but these groupings are not entirely coextensive.

==Politics==
[[File:Man being arrested.jpg|thumb|right|alt=three police officers surround a man in a tee shirt who is handcuffed|In the [[United States]], persons who are going to be questioned by police when they are in police custody must be read their "Miranda rights". The [[Miranda warning]] requires police officers to read a statement to people being arrested which informs them that they have certain rights, such as the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney.]]
Rights are often included in the foundational questions that governments and politics have been designed to deal with. Often the development of these socio-political institutions have formed a dialectical relationship with rights.

Rights about particular issues, or the rights of particular groups, are often areas of special concern. Often these concerns arise when rights come into conflict with other legal or moral issues, sometimes even other rights.  Issues of concern have historically included [[labor rights]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights]], [[reproductive rights]], [[disability rights]], [[patient rights]] and [[prisoners' rights]].  With increasing [[mass surveillance|monitoring]] and the information society, [[digital rights|information rights]], such as the [[right to privacy]] are becoming more important.

Some examples of groups whose rights are of particular concern include [[animal rights|animals]],&lt;ref name=tws21decghnnb&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, politics plays an important role in developing or recognizing the above rights, and the discussion about which behaviors are included as "rights" is an ongoing political topic of importance. The concept of rights varies with political orientation. Positive rights such as a "right to medical care" are emphasized more often by left-leaning thinkers, while right-leaning thinkers place more emphasis on negative rights such as the "right to a fair trial".

Further, the term ''equality'' which is often bound up with the meaning of "rights" often depends on one's political orientation. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and advocates of [[free markets]] often identify equality with [[equality of opportunity]], and want equal and fair rules in the process of making things, while agreeing that sometimes these fair rules lead to unequal outcomes. In contrast, [[socialism|socialists]] often identify equality with [[equality of outcome]] and see fairness when people have equal amounts of goods and services, and therefore think that people have a right to equal portions of necessities such as [[health care]] or [[Welfare|economic assistance]] or [[House|housing]].&lt;ref name=tws21dece563e&gt;{{cite news
|author = John E. Roemer
|title = Roemer on equality of opportunity
|quote = Equality of opportunity is to be contrasted with equality of outcome. While advocacy of the latter has been traditionally associated with a left-wing political philosophy, the former has been championed by conservative political philosophy. Equality of outcome fails to hold individuals responsible for imprudent actions that may, absent redress, reduce the values of the outcomes they enjoy, or for wise actions that would raise the value of the outcomes above the levels of others’. Equality of opportunity, in contrast, ‘levels the playing field,’ so that all have the potential to achieve the same outcomes; whether or not, in the event, they do, depends upon individual choice.

==Philosophy==
In [[philosophy]], [[meta-ethics]] is the branch of ethics that seeks to understand the nature of ethical [[property (philosophy)|properties]], statements, attitudes, and judgments. Meta-ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally recognized by philosophers, the others being [[normative ethics]] and [[applied ethics]].

While normative ethics addresses such questions as "What should one do?", thus endorsing some ethical evaluations and rejecting others, meta-ethics addresses questions such as "What ''is'' goodness?" and "How can we tell what is good from what is bad?", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations.

Rights ethics is an answer to the meta-ethical question of ''what normative ethics is concerned with'' (Meta-ethics also includes a group of questions about how ethics comes to be known, true, etc. which is not directly addressed by rights ethics).
Rights ethics holds that normative ethics is concerned with rights. Alternative meta-ethical theories are that ethics is concerned with one of the following:
* Duties ([[deontology]])
* [[Value (ethics)|Value]] ([[axiology]])
* Virtue ([[virtue ethics]])
* Consequences ([[consequentialism]], e.g. [[utilitarianism]])

Rights ethics has had considerable influence on political and social thinking. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] gives some concrete examples of widely accepted rights.

===Criticism===
Some philosophers have criticised rights as [[ontologically]] dubious entities.  For instance, although in favour of the extension of [[individual rights|individual legal rights]], the [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] opposed the idea of [[natural law]] and [[natural rights]], calling them "nonsense upon stilts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Ross |chapterurl=http://www.utilitarian.net/bentham/about/1995----.htm |chapter=Jeremy Bentham |editor-last=Honderich |editor-first=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |pages=85–88 }} Also see {{cite web |last=Sweet |first=William |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/b/bentham.htm |title=Jeremy Bentham |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=7 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, one can question the ability of rights to actually bring about justice for all.

==Etymology==
[[File:Beowulf - rihte.jpg|thumb|"rihte," an Old English word for 'right']]
The [[Modern English]] word ''right'' derives from [[Old English]] ''riht'' or ''reht'', in turn from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*riχtaz'' meaning "right" or "direct", and ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*reg-to-'' meaning "having moved in a straight line", in turn from ''*(o)reg'(a)-'' meaning "to straighten or direct".&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:right]]&lt;/ref&gt; In several different [[Indo-European languages]], a single word derived from the same root means both "right" and "law", such as French ''droit'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:droit]]&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish ''derecho'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:derecho]]&lt;/ref&gt; German ''Recht'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:recht]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Italian ''diritto''.

Many other words related to normative or regulatory concepts derive from this same root, including ''correct'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:correct]]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''regulate'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:regulate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''rex''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rex#latin]]&lt;/ref&gt; (meaning "king"), whence ''regal''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:regal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and thence ''royal''.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:royal]]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise many more geometric terms derive from this same root, such as ''erect'' (as in "upright"),&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:erect]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''rectangle'' (literally "[[right angle]]"),&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rectangle]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''straight''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:straight]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''stretch''.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:stretch]]&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''right'', the English words ''rule''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rule]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ruler'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ruler]]&lt;/ref&gt; deriving still from the same root, have both normative or regulatory and geometric meanings (e.g. a ruler as in a king, or a ruler as in a straightedge).

Several other roots have similar normative and geometric descendants, such as Latin ''norma'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:norma#latin]]&lt;/ref&gt; whence ''[[norm (philosophy)|norm]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:norm]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''normal'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:normal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''normative''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:normative]]&lt;/ref&gt; itself, and also geometric concepts such as ''[[Normal (geometry)|normal vectors]]''; and likewise Greek ''ortho''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ortho]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin ''ordo'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ordo]]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning either "right" or "correct" (as in ''orthodox'', meaning "correct opinion"&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:orthodox]]&lt;/ref&gt;) or "straight" or "perpendicular" (as in ''orthogonal'', meaning "perpendicular angle"&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:orthogonal]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and thence ''order'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:order]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''ordinary'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ordinary]]&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

==History==
{{see also|History of human rights}}
[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Magna Carta]]'' or "Great Charter" was one of England's first documents containing commitments by a [[monarch|king]] to his people to respect certain [[law|legal]] rights. It reduced the power of the monarch.]]

[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a painting; the painting is of a written declaration; there are two human images to the left and right; it says "Declaration des droits de l'homme" (declaration of the rights of man)|The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in 1789 in [[France]].]]

The specific enumeration of rights has differed greatly in different periods of history. In many cases, the system of rights promulgated by one group has come into sharp and bitter conflict with that of other groups. In the political sphere, a place in which rights have historically been an important issue, constitutional provisions of various states sometimes address the question of who has what legal rights.

Historically, many notions of rights were [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], with different people granted different rights, and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to respected from his son did not indicate a right from the son to receive a return from that respect; and the [[divine right of kings]], which permitted absolute power over subjects, did not leave a lot of room for many rights for the subjects themselves.&lt;ref name=tws21decfrre&gt;{{cite news

|quote = [...] the idea that a king was sacred, appointed by God and above the judgment of earthly powers [...] was called the Divine Right of Kings and it entered so powerfully into British culture during the 17th century that it shaped the pomp and circumstance of the Stuart monarchs, imbued the writing of Shakespeare and provoked the political thinking of Milton and Locke.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, modern conceptions of rights have often emphasized [[liberty]] and [[egalitarianism|equality]] as among the most important aspects of rights, as was evident in the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions.

Important documents in the [[political history]] of rights include:

* The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of [[History of Iran|ancient Iran]] established unprecedented principles of human rights in the 6th century BC under [[Cyrus the Great]].

* The [[Magna Carta]] (1215; [[England]]) required the [[King of England]] to renounce certain rights and respect certain legal procedures, and to accept that the will of the king could be bound by [[English law|law]], after King John promised his barons he would follow the "law of the land". While Magna Carta was originally a set of rules that the king had to follow, and mainly protected the property of aristocratic landowners, today the Magna Carta is seen as the basis of certain rights for ordinary people, such as the right of due process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lepore|first=Jill|date=April 20, 2015|title=The Rule of History: Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, and the hold of time.|url=|journal=New Yorker|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] (1689; England) declared that [[Englishmen]], as embodied by [[Parliament]], possess certain civil and political rights; the [[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]] (1689; Scotland) was similar but distinct.
* The [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] (1776) by [[George Mason]] declared the inherent natural rights and [[separation of powers]].
* The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] (1776) succinctly defined the rights of man as including, but not limited to, "[[Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness]]" which later influenced "[[liberté, égalité, fraternité]]" (liberty, equality, fraternity) in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Dyck | first = Rand | title = Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches (3rd edition) | publisher = [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]] | year = 2000 | location =  | isbn = 978-0-17-616792-9 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 [[Constitution of Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/1947con.html|title=1947 Japanese Constitution|author=|date=|website=history.hanover.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in President [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s 1945 declaration of independence of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1945vietnam.html|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|author=|date=|website=www.fordham.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative phrase "life, liberty and property", is found in the [[Declaration of Colonial Rights]], a resolution of the [[First Continental Congress]].

* The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] (1789; France), one of the fundamental documents of the [[French Revolution]], defined a set of individual rights and collective rights of the people.
* The [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] (1785; United States), written by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1779, was a document that asserted the right of man to form a personal relationship with God free from interference by the state.
* The [[United States Bill of Rights]] (1789–1791; United States), the first ten amendments of the [[United States Constitution]] specified rights of individuals in which government could not interfere, including the rights of free assembly, freedom of religion, trial by jury, and the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.
* The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948) is an overarching set of standards by which governments, organisations and individuals would measure their behaviour towards each other.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  The preamble declares that the "...recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[justice]] and [[peace]] in the world..."

}}
'''Snake Jailbird''' (usually referred to as simply '''Snake''') is a recurring [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in the [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]'', who is voiced by [[Hank Azaria]]. Snake's first appearance was in the episode "[[The War of the Simpsons]]". His [[catchphrase]] is "Bye!", which he usually says when he is in trouble. His real name is '''Albert Knickerbocker Aloysius Snake''', although a Simpsons card says his name is Chester Turley. He was named the 19th (out of 25) of [[IGN]]'s Top 25 Simpsons [[Peripheral]] Characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/16/the-simpsons-top-25-peripheral-characters|title=IGN: Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters|publisher=Tv.ign.com|accessdate=2014-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
Snake is [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]'s resident [[Recidivism|recidivist]] felon, always getting arrested but rarely staying in [[Prison|jail]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snpp.com/guides/snake.file.html&lt;/ref&gt; He speaks with a [[California English|Valley Boy]] accent and has a [[tattoo]] of a snake on his arm, which is presumably the source of his nickname. He is partial to fast cars and fast women, and has a knack for reckless abandon. He was formerly an idealistic [[Indiana Jones]]-type [[archaeologist]] until [[Moe Szyslak]] stole the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] gold coins he had discovered and was going to donate to the museum, and he decided to take his revenge out on society ([[convenience store]]s).

He also attended [[Middlebury College]] and repaid his student loans after robbing [[Moe's Tavern|Moe's tavern]]. He once ran a [[telemarketing]] scam, but could not stick to it because he did not like bothering people at home. He also wrote the books, ''The Ten Habits of Highly Successful Criminals'' and ''A Criminal's Guide to Hiding in [[Mexico]]''. When wearing a prison uniform, his prison number is 7F20, which is the production code of his [[The War of the Simpsons|debut episode]].

In "[[Pygmoelian]]", it was revealed that Snake had a son. "[[Luca$]]" and "[[The Seemingly Never-Ending Story]]" both give the son's name as Jeremy. The episode reveals that Snake has custody issues with his son. He is a loving father to Jeremy; unfortunately he is raising his son to be much like himself. In "[[Pygmoelian]]", he helps his son steal Lisa's bicycle, and beams with pride when his son exclaims, "Daddy, I'm stealing!" In addition to his son, Snake has a brother (or other male relative) who looks and talks very similarly, as seen in ''[[The Springfield Connection]]'' where the two run a [[Three-card Monte]] game. His girlfriend Gloria (who is awkwardly a cop) briefly dated [[Mr. Burns]], but then came back to him. Gloria was voiced by [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] on several occasions. (In one instance, she visits Snake in prison, where he tells her to kill someone who has been editing his Wikipedia page).

In "[[Luca$]]", he becomes friends with [[Bart Simpson]], and Bart tries to protect him from the [[electric chair]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesimpsons.com/#/recaps/season-25_episode-17 "Luca$" episode], thesimpsons.com; accessed September 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other appearances==
He is a major character in ''[[The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run]]'', ''[[The Simpsons: Road Rage]]'', and a supporting character in ''[[The Simpsons Game]]''. He also appears in ''[[The Simpsons: Tapped Out]]''. He appears in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', as part of the local mob headed by [[Fat Tony (The Simpsons)|Fat Tony]].

==Character==
===Creation===
Snake first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]] episode "[[The War of the Simpsons]]". His first name was first mentioned by his cellmate [[Sideshow Bob]] in "[[Black Widower]]". In the script, the writers had simply mentioned a character named Snake and it had been the directors who had assigned that existing character design to the name.&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned in the DVD commentary for "[[Black Widower]]"&lt;/ref&gt; Snake's voice is based on Hank Azaria's old college roommate.&lt;ref name=barber&gt;{{cite video|people=Azaria, Hank|year=2004|title=The Simpsons The Complete Fifth Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Homer's Barbershop Quartet]]"|medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name===
In the episode "[[The Seemingly Never-Ending Story]]", Lisa tells a story in which Snake refers to himself as Professor Jailbird. In "[[Luca$]]", his name is said to be Albert Knickerbocker Aloysius Snake.

'''Statistical language acquisition''', is a branch of [[developmental psychology|developmental]] [[psycholinguistics]], that studies the process by which humans develop the ability to perceive, produce, comprehend, and communicate with [[natural language]] in all of its aspects ([[phonology|phonological]], [[syntax|syntactic]], [[lexicon|lexical]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[semantics|semantic]]) through the use of general learning mechanisms operating on statistical patterns in the linguistic input.  [[Statistical learning in language acquisition|Statistical learning]] acquisition claims that infants language learning is based on pattern perception rather than an innate biological grammar. Several statistical elements such as frequency of words, frequent frames, phonotactic patterns and other regularities provide information on language structure and meaning for facilitation of language acquisition.

==Philosophy==
Fundamental to the study of statistical language acquisition is the centuries-old debate between [[rationalism]] (or its modern manifestation in the psycholinguistic community, [[psychological nativism|nativism]]) and [[empiricism]], with researchers in this field falling strongly in support of the latter category. Nativism is the position that humans are born with innate [[domain specificity|domain-specific]] knowledge, especially inborn capacities for language learning. Ranging from seventeenth century rationalist philosophers such as [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] to contemporary philosophers such as [[Richard Montague]] and linguists such as [[Noam Chomsky]], nativists posit an innate learning mechanism with the specific function of language acquisition.&lt;ref name = "philo"&gt;Russell, J. (2004). What is Language Development?: Rationalist, Empiricist, and Pragmatist Approaches to the Acquisition of Syntax. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, this debate has largely surrounded Chomsky's support of a [[universal grammar]], properties that all natural languages must have, through the controversial postulation of a [[language acquisition device]] (LAD), an instinctive mental 'organ' responsible for language learning which searches all possible language alternatives and chooses the parameters that best match the learner's environmental linguistic input. Much of Chomsky's theory is founded on the [[poverty of the stimulus]] (POTS) argument, the assertion that a child's linguistic data is so limited and corrupted that learning language from this data alone is impossible. As an example, many proponents of POTS claim that because children are never exposed to negative evidence, that is, information about what phrases are ungrammatical, the language structure they learn would not resemble that of correct speech without a language-specific learning mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. (1965). Aspects of the Theory of Syntax. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chomsky's argument for an internal system responsible for language, biolinguistics, poses a three factor model.  "Genetic endowment" allows the infant to extract linguistic info, detect rules, and have universal grammar.  "External environment" illuminates the need to interact with others and the benefits of language exposure at an early age.  The last factor encompasses the brain properties, learning principles, and computational efficiencies that enable children to pick up on language rapidly using patterns and strategies.

Standing in stark contrast to this position is empiricism, the [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory that all knowledge comes from sensory experience. This school of thought often characterizes the nascent mind as a [[tabula rasa]], or blank slate, and can in many ways be associated with the nurture perspective of the "[[nature versus nurture|nature vs. nurture debate]]". This viewpoint has a long historical tradition that parallels that of rationalism, beginning with seventeenth century empiricist philosophers such as [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[Hobbes]], and, in the following century, [[David Hume|Hume]]. The basic tenet of empiricism is that information in the environment is structured enough that its patterns are both detectable and extractable by domain-general learning mechanisms.&lt;ref name = "philo"/&gt; In terms of [[language acquisition]], these patterns can be either linguistic or social in nature.

Chomsky is very critical of this empirical theory of language acquisition. He has said, "It's true there's been a lot of work on trying to apply statistical models to various linguistic problems. I think there have been some successes, but a lot of failures." He claims the idea of using statistical methods to acquire language is simply a mimicry of the process, rather than a true understanding of how language is acquired.&lt;ref&gt;http://norvig.com/chomsky.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental paradigms==

===Headturn Preference Procedure (HPP)===
One of the most used experimental [[paradigm]]s in investigations of infants' capacities for statistical language acquisition is the Headturn Preference Procedure (HPP), developed by [[Stanford University|Stanford]] psychologist [[Anne Fernald]] in 1985 to study infants' preferences for prototypical [[baby talk|child-directed speech]] over normal adult speech.&lt;ref&gt;Fernald, A. (1985). Four-Month-Old Infants Prefer to Listen to Motherese ". Infant Behavior and Development, 181-195.&lt;/ref&gt; In the classic HPP paradigm, infants are allowed to freely turn their heads and are seated between two speakers with mounted lights. The light of either the right or left speaker then flashes as that speaker provides some type of audial or linguistic input stimulus to the infant. Reliable orientation to a given side is taken to be an indication of a preference for the input associated with that side's speaker. This paradigm has since become increasingly important in the study of [[Speech perception#Infant speech perception|infant speech perception]], especially for input at levels higher than [[syllable]] chunks, though with some modifications, including using the listening times instead of the side preference as the relevant dependent measure.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swingley | first1 = D | year = 2009 | title = Contributions of infant word learning to language development | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 364 | issue = 1536| pages = 3617–32 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2009.0107 | pmid = 19933136 | pmc = 2828984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conditioned Headturn Procedure===
Similar to HPP, the Conditioned Headturn Procedure also makes use of an infant's differential preference for a given side as an indication of a preference for, or more often a familiarity with, the input or speech associated with that side. Used in studies of [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] boundary markers by Gout et al. (2004)&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt; and later by Werker in her classic studies of [[categorical perception]] of [[first language|native-language]]  [[phoneme]]s,&lt;ref name = "werker"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Werker | first1 = J. F. | last2 = Lalonde | first2 = C. E. | year = 1988 | title = Cross-Language Speech Perception : Initial Capabilities and Developmental Change | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 5| pages = 672–683 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.24.5.672| citeseerx = 10.1.1.460.9810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; infants are [[classical conditioning|conditioned]] by some attractive image or display to look in one of two directions every time a certain input is heard, a whole word in Gout's case and a single phonemic syllable in Werker's. After the conditioning, new or more complex input is then presented to the infant, and their ability to detect the earlier target word or distinguish the input of the two trials is observed by whether they turn their head in expectation of the conditioned display or not.

===Anticipatory eye movement===
While HPP and the Conditioned Headturn Procedure allow for observations of behavioral responses to stimuli and after the fact inferences about what the subject's expectations must have been to motivate this behavior, the Anticipatory Eye Movement paradigm allows researchers to directly observe a subject's expectations before the event occurs. By [[eye tracking|tracking]] subjects' [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]] researchers have been able to investigate infant [[decision-making]] and the ways in which infants encode and act on [[probabilistic logic|probabilistic knowledge]] to make predictions about their environments.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, S. J., Newport, E. L., &amp; Aslin, R. N. (2009). Probability-matching in 10-month-old infants. Methods.&lt;/ref&gt; This paradigm also offers the advantage of comparing differences in eye movement behavior across a wider range of ages than others.

===Artificial languages===
[[Artificial language]]s, that is, small-scale languages that typically have an extremely limited [[vocabulary]] and simplified [[grammar]] rules, are a commonly used paradigm for [[psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic]] researchers. Artificial languages allow researchers to isolate variables of interest and wield a greater degree of control over the input the subject will receive. Unfortunately, the overly simplified nature of these languages and the absence of a number of phenomena common to all human natural languages such as [[rhythm]], [[pitch (music)|pitch]] changes, and sequential regularities raise questions of [[external validity]] for any findings obtained using this paradigm, even after attempts have been made to increase the [[complexity]] and richness of the languages used.&lt;ref name = "soundtomeaning"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hay | first1 = J. F. | last2 = Pelucchi | first2 = B. | last3 = Estes | first3 = K. G. | last4 = Saffran | first4 = J. R. | year = 2011 | title = Linking sounds to meanings: Infant statistical learning in a natural language | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 63 | issue = 2| pages = 93–106 | doi = 10.1016/j.cogpsych.2011.06.002 | pmid = 21762650 | pmc = 3143199 | bibcode = 1992CogPs..24..535V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The artificial language's lack of complexity or decreased complexity fails to account for a child's need to recognize a given syllable in natural language regardless of the sound variability inherent to natural language, though "it is possible that the complexity of natural language actually facilitates learning."&lt;ref name = "statlearn"&gt;Romberg, A. R., &amp; Saffran, J. R. (2010). Statistical learning and language acquisition. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. WIREs Cognitive Science. http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/infantlearning/Publications_files/Romberg.Saffran.2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, artificial language experiments are typically conducted to explore what the relevant linguistic variables are, what sources of information infants are able to use and when, and how researchers can go about modeling the [[learning]] and acquisition process.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt; [[Richard N. Aslin|Aslin]] and [[Elissa L. Newport|Newport]], for example, have used artificial languages to explore what features of linguistic input make certain [[pattern]]s salient and easily detectable by infants, allowing them to easily contrast the detection of syllable repetition with that of word-final syllables and make conclusions about the conditions under which either feature is recognized as important.&lt;ref name = "general"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aslin | first1 = R. N. | last2 = Newport | first2 = E. L. | year = 2012 | title = Statistical Learning : From Acquiring Specific Items to Forming General Rules | url = | journal = Distribution | volume = 21| issue = 3| pages = 170–176| doi = 10.1177/0963721412436806 | pmid = 24000273 | pmc = 3758750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio and audiovisual recordings===
Statistical learning has been shown to play a large role in language acquisition, but social interaction appears to be a necessary component of learning as well. In one study, infants presented with audio or audiovisual recordings of Mandarin speakers failed to distinguish the phonemes of the language.&lt;ref name = "crackingcode"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuhl | first1 = Patricia K | year = 2004 | title = Early language acquisition: cracking the speech code | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue = 11| pages = 831–843 | doi = 10.1038/nrn1533 | pmid=15496861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "social learning"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuhl | first1 = Patricia K | year = 2007 | title = Is speech learning "gated" by the social brain | url = http://ilabs.washington.edu/kuhl/pdf/Kuhl_2007.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 11–120 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00572.x | pmid = 17181708 | bibcode = 2003DevSc...6...72N }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This implies that simply hearing the sounds is not sufficient for language learning; social interaction cues the infant to take statistics. Particular interactions geared towards infants is known as "child-directed" language because it is more repetitive and associative, which makes it easier to learn. These "child directed" interactions could also be the reason why it is easier to learn a language as a child rather than an adult.

===Bilinguals===
Studies of bilingual infants, such as a study Bijeljac-Babic, et al., on French-learning infants, have offered insight to the role of prosody in language acquisition.&lt;ref name = "bijeljac-babic"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bibeljac-Babic | first1 = Ranka | last2 = Serres | first2 = Josette | last3 = Höhle | first3 = Barbara | last4 = Nazzi | first4 = Thierry | year = 2012 | title = Effect of Bilingualism on Lexical Stress Pattern Discrimination in French-Learning Infants | url = | journal = PLOS ONE | volume =  7| issue = 2| page =  e30843| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0030843 | pmid = 22363500 | pmc = 3281880 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...730843B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bijeljac-Babic study found that language dominance influences "sensitivity to prosodic contrasts." Although this was not a study on statistical learning, its findings on prosodic pattern recognition might have implications for statistical learning.

It is possible that the kinds of language experience and knowledge gained through the statistical learning of the first language influences one's acquisition of a second language. Some research points to the possibility that the difficulty of learning a second language may be derived from the structural patterns and language cues that one has already picked up from his or her acquisition of first language. In that sense, the knowledge of and skills to process the first language from statistical acquisition may act as a complicating factor when one tries to learn a new language with different sentence structures, grammatical rules, and speech patterns.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Important findings==

===Phonetic category learning===
The first step in developing knowledge of a system as complex as natural language is learning to distinguish the important language-specific classes of sounds, called phonemes, that distinguish meaning between words. [[University of British Columbia|UBC]] psychologist [[Janet Werker]], since her influential series of experiments in the 1980s, has been one of the most prominent figures in the effort to understand the process by which human babies develop these phonological distinctions. While adults who speak different languages are unable to distinguish meaningful sound differences in other languages that do not delineate different meanings in their own, babies are born with the ability to universally distinguish all speech sounds. Werker's work has shown that while infants at six to eight months are still able to perceive the difference between certain [[Hindi]] and [[English language|English]]  [[consonant]]s, they have completely lost this ability by 11 to 13 months.&lt;ref name = "werker"/&gt;

It is now commonly accepted that children use some form of perceptual [[distributional hypothesis|distributional learning]], by which categories are discovered by clumping similar instances of an input stimulus, to form phonetic categories early in life.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt; Developing children have been found to be effective judges of linguistic authority, screening the input they model their language on by shifting their [[attention]] less to speakers who mispronounce words.&lt;ref name = "review" /&gt;   Infants also use statistical tracking to calculate the likelihood that particular phonemes will follow each other.&lt;ref name = "Romberg/saffron"&gt; Romberg, Alexa R and Sarron, Jenny R. (2010). "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3112001/ Statistical Learning and Language Acquisition]."  WIREs Cogn Sci 10.1002/wbs.78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parsing===
[[Parsing]] is the process by which a continuous speech stream is segmented into its [[:wikt:discrete|discrete]] meaningful units, e.g. [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], [[word]]s, and syllables. [[Jenny Saffran|Saffran]] (1996) represents a singularly seminal study in this line of research. Infants were presented with two minutes of continuous speech of an artificial language from a computerized voice to remove any interference from [[extraneous variable]]s such as prosody or [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. After this presentation, infants were able to distinguish words from nonwords, as measured by longer looking times in the second case.&lt;ref name = "saffran"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.274.5294.1926 |pmid=8943209 |bibcode=1996Sci...274.1926S |title=Statistical Learning by 8-Month-Old Infants |journal=Science |volume=274 |issue=5294 |pages=1926-8 |last1=Saffran |first1=Jenny R |last2=Aslin |first2=Richard N |last3=Newport |first3=Elissa L |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important concept in understanding these results is that of [[markov chain|transitional probability]], the [[likelihood]] of an element, in this case a syllable, following or preceding another element. In this experiment, syllables that went together in words had a much higher transitional probability than did syllables at [[Word#Word boundaries|word boundaries]] that just happened to be adjacent.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "soundtomeaning"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "saffran"/&gt; Incredibly, infants, after a short two-minute presentation, were able to keep track of these [[statistics]] and recognize high [[probability]] words. Further research has since replicated these results with natural languages unfamiliar to infants, indicating that learning infants also keep track of the direction (forward or backward) of the transitional probabilities.&lt;ref name = "soundtomeaning"/&gt; Though the neural processes behind this phenomenon remain largely unknown, recent research reports increased activity in the [[Inferior frontal gyrus|left inferior frontal gyrus]] and the [[middle frontal gyrus]] during the detection of word boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNealy | first1 = K | last2 = Mazziotta | first2 = JC | last3 = Dapretto | first3 = M | year = 2006 | title = Cracking the language code: Neural mechanisms underlying speech parsing | url = | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 26 | issue = 29| pages = 7629–7639 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.5501-05.2006| pmid = 16855090 | pmc = 3713232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of syllable-ordering biases is an important step along the way to full language development. The ability to categorize syllables and group together frequently [[co-occurrence|co-occurring]] sequences may be critical in the development of a ''protolexicon'', a set of common language-specific word templates based on characteristic patterns in the words an infant hears. The development of this protolexicon may in turn allow for the recognition of new types of patterns, e.g. the high frequency of word-initially [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]] consonants in English, which would allow infants to further parse words by recognizing common prosodic phrasings as autonomous linguistic units, restarting the dynamic cycle of word and language learning.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

===Referent-label associations===
The question of how novice language-users are capable of associating learned [[name|labels]] with the appropriate [[referent]], the person or object in the environment which the label names, has been at the heart of [[philosophy|philosophical]] considerations of [[philosophy of language|language]] and [[meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]] from [[Plato]] to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] to [[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]].&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein, M.H., &amp; Lamb, M.E. (Eds.). (2011). Developmental Science: An Advanced Textbook. New York, NY: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; This problem, that of finding some solid relationship between word and object, of finding a word's [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] without succumbing to an infinite recursion of dictionary look-up, is known as the [[symbol grounding|symbol grounding problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harnad | first1 = S | year = 1990 | title = The Symbol Grounding Problem | url = | journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena | volume = 42 | issue = 1–3| pages = 335–346 | doi=10.1016/0167-2789(90)90087-6| bibcode = 1990PhyD...42..335H | arxiv = cs/9906002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have shown that this problem is intimately linked with the ability to parse language, and that those words that are easy to segment due to their high transitional probabilities are also easier to [[conceptual metaphor|map]] to an appropriate referent.&lt;ref name = "soundtomeaning"/&gt; This serves as further evidence of the developmental progression of language acquisition, with children requiring an understanding of the sound distributions of natural languages to form phonetic categories, parse words based on these categories, and then use these parses to map them to objects as labels.

The developmentally earliest understanding of word to referent associations have been reported at six months old, with infants comprehending the words ' [[mother|mommy]]' and '[[father|daddy]]' or their familial or cultural equivalents. Further studies have shown that infants quickly develop in this capacity and by seven months are capable of learning associations between moving images and [[nonsense]] words and syllables.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

It is important to note that there is a distinction, often confounded in acquisition research, between mapping a label to a specific [[type-token distinction|instance]] or individual and mapping a label to an entire [[type-token distinction|class]] of objects. This latter process is sometimes referred to as [[generalization]] or rule learning. Research has shown that if input is encoded in terms of perceptually salient dimensions rather than specific details and if patterns in the input indicate that a number of objects are named interchangeably in the same context, a language learner will be much more likely to generalize that name to every instance with the relevant features. This tendency is heavily dependent on the consistency of context clues and the degree to which word contexts overlap in the input.&lt;ref name = "general"/&gt; These differences are furthermore linked to the well-known patterns of [[Organizing Knowledge Cognitively#Concepts|under]] and [[Organizing Knowledge Cognitively#Concepts|overgeneralization]] in infant [[vocabulary development|word learning]]. Research has also shown that the frequency in co-occurrence of referents is tracked as well, which helps create associations and dispel ambiguities in object-referent models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vouloumanos|first=Athena|title=Fine-grained sensitivity to statistical information in adult word learning|journal=Cognition|date=May 2008|volume=107|issue=2|pages=729–742|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2007.08.007|pmid=17950721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to appropriately generalize to whole classes of yet unseen words, coupled with the abilities to parse continuous speech and keep track of word-ordering regularities, may be the critical skills necessary to develop proficiency with and knowledge of syntax and grammar.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

===Differences in autistic populations===
According to recent research, there is no neural evidence of statistical language learning in children with [[Autistic spectrum disorder|autism spectrum disorders]]. When exposed to a continuous stream of artificial speech, neurotypical children displayed less cortical activity in the [[Frontal cortex|dorsolateral frontal cortices]] (specifically the [[middle frontal gyrus]]) as cues for word boundaries increased. However activity in these networks remained unchanged in autistic children, regardless of the verbal cues provided. This evidence, highlighting the importance of proper Frontal Lobe brain function is in support of the "Executive Functions" Theory, used to explain some of the biologically related causes of Autistic language deficits.  With impaired working memory, decision making, planning, and goal setting, which are vital functions of the Frontal Lobe, Autistic children are at loss when it comes to socializing and communication (Ozonoff, et al., 2004). Additionally, researchers have found that the level of communicative impairment in autistic children was inversely correlated with signal increases in these same regions during exposure to artificial languages. Based on this evidence, researchers have concluded that children with autism spectrum disorders don't have the neural architecture to identify word boundaries in continuous speech. Early word segmentation skills have been shown to predict later language development, which could explain why language delay is a hallmark feature of autism spectrum disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scott-Van Zeeland | first1 = A.

=== Statistical language learning across situations ===
Language learning takes place in different contexts, with both the infant and the caregiver engaging in social interactions. Recent research have investigated how infants and adults use cross-situational statistics in order to learn about not only the meanings of words but also the constraints within a context. For example, Smith and his colleagues proposed that infants learn language by acquiring a bias to label objects to similar objects that come from categories that are well-defined. Important to this view is the idea that the constraints that assist learning of words are not independent of the input itself or the infant's experience. Rather, constraints come about as infants learn about the ways that the words are used and begin to pay attention to certain characteristics of objects that have been used in the past to represent the words.

Inductive learning problem can occur as words are oftentimes used in ambiguous situations in which there are more than one possible referents available. This can lead to confusion for the infants as they may not be able to distinguish which words should be extended to label objects being referenced to. Smith and Yu proposed that a way to make a distinction in such ambiguous situations is to track the word-referent pairings over multiple scenes. For instance, an infant who hears a word in the presence of object A and object B will be unsure of whether the word is the referent of object A or object B. However, if the infant then hears the label again in the presence of object B and object C, the infant can conclude that object B is the referent of the label because object B consistently pairs with the label across different situations.

==Computational models==
[[Computational model]]s have long been used to explore the mechanisms by which language learners process and manipulate linguistic [[information]]. Models of this type allow researchers to systematically control important learning variables that are oftentimes difficult to manipulate at all in human participants.&lt;ref name = "zins"&gt;Zinszer, B. &amp; Li, P. (2010). [https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt55v2387s/qt55v2387s.pdf A SOM model of first language lexical attrition]. In S. Ohlsson &amp; R. Catrambone (Eds.), Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 2787-2792). Austin, TX: Cognitive Science Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associative models===
[[artificial neural network|Associative neural network]] models of language acquisition are one of the oldest types of [[cognitive model]], using [[neural network|distributed representations]] and changes in the weights of the connections between the nodes that make up these representations to simulate learning in a manner reminiscent of the [[neuroplasticity|plasticity]]-based [[neuron]]al reorganization that forms the basis of human learning and [[memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seidenberg | first1 = M. S. | last2 = Mcclelland | first2 = J. L. | year = 1989 | title = A Distributed, Developmental Model of Word Recognition and Naming | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 96 | issue = 4| pages = 523–568 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.96.4.523 | pmid=2798649| citeseerx = 10.1.1.127.3083 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Associative models represent a break with [[GOFAI|classical cognitive]] models, characterized by discrete and [[physical symbol system|context-free symbols]], in favor of a [[dynamical system]]s approach to language better capable of handling [[time|temporal]] considerations.&lt;ref name = "lexorg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = P | year = 2009 | title = Lexical organization and competition in first and second languages: computational and neural mechanisms | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 629–64 | doi = 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2009.01028.x | pmid = 21585481 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A precursor to this approach, and one of the first model types to account for the dimension of time in linguistic comprehension and production was [[Jeffrey Elman|Elman]]'s [[Simple recurrent network#Elman networks and Jordan networks|simple recurrent network]] (SRN). By making use of a [[feedback]] network to represent the system's past states, SRNs were able in a word-prediction task to [[cluster analysis|cluster]] input into self-organized [[grammatical category|grammatical categories]] based solely on statistical co-occurrence patterns.&lt;ref name = "lexorg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "srn"&gt;Elman, J. L. (1975). Language as a dynamical system. Most.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early successes such as these paved the way for dynamical systems research into linguistic acquisition, answering many questions about early linguistic development but leaving many others unanswered, such as how these statistically acquired [[lexeme]]s are [[representation (psychology)|represented]].&lt;ref name = "lexorg"/&gt; Of particular importance in recent research has been the effort to understand the dynamic interaction of learning (e.g. language-based) and learner (e.g. speaker-based) variables in lexical organization and [[competition model|competition]] in [[multilingualism|bilinguals]].&lt;ref name = "zins"/&gt; In the ceaseless effort to move toward more psychologically realistic models, many researchers have turned to a subset of associative models, [[self-organizing map]]s (SOMs), as established, cognitively plausible models of language development.&lt;ref&gt;Kohonen, T. (n.d.). The Self-Organizing Map.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhao | first1 = X. | last2 = Li | first2 = P. | last3 = Kohonen | first3 = T. | year = 2011 | title = Contextual self-organizing map: software for constructing semantic representations | url = | journal = Behavior Research Methods | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 77–88 | doi = 10.3758/s13428-010-0042-z | pmid = 21287105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SOMs have been helpful to researchers in identifying and investigating the constraints and variables of interest in a number of acquisition processes, and in exploring the consequences of these findings on linguistic and cognitive theories. By identifying [[working memory]] as an important constraint both for language learners and for current computational models, researchers have been able to show that manipulation of this variable allows for [[bootstrapping (linguistics)|syntactic bootstrapping]], drawing not just categorical but actual content meaning from words' positional co-occurrence in sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Li, P., Burgess, C., &amp; Lund, K. (2000). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.40.476&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf The Acquisition of Word Meaning through Global Lexical Co-occurrences]. Young Children.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Probabilistic models===
Some recent [[statistical model|models]] of language acquisition have centered around methods of [[Bayesian Inference]] to account for infants' abilities to appropriately parse streams of speech and acquire word meanings. Models of this type rely heavily on the notion of [[conditional probability]] (the probability of A given B), in line with findings concerning infants' use of transitional probabilities of words and syllables to learn words.&lt;ref name = "saffran"/&gt;

Models that make use of these probabilistic methods have been able to merge the previously [[dichotomy|dichotomous]] language acquisition perspectives of [[social interactionist theory|social theories]] that emphasize the importance of learning speaker intentions and statistical and [[relational frame theory|associative theories]] that rely on cross-situational contexts into a single joint-inference problem. This approach has led to important results in explaining acquisition phenomena such as [[mutual exclusivity (psychology)|mutual exclusivity]], one-trial learning or [[fast mapping]], and the use of [[intention|social intentions]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank, M. C., Goodman, N. D., &amp; Tenenbaum, J. B. (2009). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.422.1822&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Using Speakers ' Referential Intentions to Model Early Cross-Situational Word Learning]. Psychological Science, 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these results seem to be robust, studies concerning these models' abilities to handle more complex situations such as multiple referent to single label mapping, multiple label to single referent mapping, and bilingual language acquisition in comparison to associative models' successes in these areas have yet to be explored. Hope remains, though, that these model types may be merged to provide a comprehensive account of language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Griffiths | first1 = T. L. | last2 = Chater | first2 = N. | last3 = Kemp | first3 = C. | last4 = Perfors | first4 = A. | last5 = Tenenbaum | first5 = J.

===C/V hypothesis===
Along the lines of probabilistic frequencies, the C/V hypothesis basically states all language hearers use consonantal frequencies to distinguish between words (lexical distinctions) in continuous speech strings, in comparison to vowels. Vowels are more pertinent to rhythmic identification. Several follow-up studies revealed this finding, as they showed that vowels are processed independently of their local statistical distribution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sissa.it/cns/Books/Linguistic%20Contstraints_in%20Rebuschat%20&amp;%20Williams.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Other research has shown that the consonant-vowel ratio doesn't influence the sizes of lexicons when comparing distinct languages.  In the case of languages with a higher consonant ratio, children may depend more on consonant neighbors than rhyme or vowel frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Lambertsen, Claus; Oetting, Janna; Barlow, Jessica. Journal of Speech, Language &amp; Hearing Research. Oct2012, Vol. 55 Issue 5, p1265-1273.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Algorithms for language acquisition ===
Some models of language acquisition have been based on [[adaptive parsing]]&lt;ref name="Lehman2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jill Fain Lehman|title=Adaptive Parsing: Self-Extending Natural Language Interfaces|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tU_tBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22language%20acquisition%22&amp;f=false|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4615-3622-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[grammar induction]] algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;Chater, Nick, and Christopher D.

'''The Theological Method of Samkara''' is [[Richard De Smet]]'s [[doctoral dissertation]], defended at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], Rome, in 1953, with Fr Renatus Arnou, SJ as director. The dissertation, which rapidly became well-known, remains unpublished {{what|date=October 2017}}. The dissertation proposed that [[Sankaracarya|Sankara]] was not so much a pure philosopher, but rather a ''srutivadin'' or theologian, an exegete or hermeneutician of the scriptures. It also proposed that the doctrine of indirect signification (''lakṣaṇā'') plays a central role in Sankara's theological method.&lt;ref&gt;De Smet, 'The Theological Method of Samkara' 290, 292.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the dissertation itself, De Smet does not arrive clearly at his later rejection of the classical illusionist (''mayavadin'') monistic interpretation of Sankara in favour of a non-dualist 'realist' one.&lt;ref&gt;I. Coelho, "Introduction," ''Understanding Sankara: Essays by Richard De Smet,'' ed. Ivo Coelho (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, forthcoming) 4-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
De Smet himself reports that he sent the dissertation to various specialists in 1954, people like [[Olivier Lacombe]], [[Hajime Nakamura]], S.K. Belvalkar, Dhirendra Mohan Datta, Paul Hacker, [[Helmuth von Glasenapp]], [[Pierre Johanns]], A.J. Alston, [[Louis Renou]], A.C. Mukerji, Daniel Ingalls, Jacques-Albert Cuttat, [[Hubert Olympus Mascarenhas|H.O. Mascarenhas]] and J.B. van Buitenen, who seem to have appraised it positively.&lt;ref&gt;R. De Smet, "From the Vedas to Radhakrishnan," ''Understanding Sankara: Essays by Richard De Smet'' ch. 19, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

While De Smet's thesis has not been completely accepted among Indologists in general and among specialists of Sankara, it has received a positive reception by K. Satchidananda Murty in his ''Revelation and Reason in Advaita''&lt;ref&gt;(Waltair: Andhra University Press, 1959; reprint Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; and by Anantanand Rambachan in his ''Accomplishing the Accomplished: The Vedas as a Source of Valid Knowledge in Sankara''.&lt;ref&gt;(Honululu: University of Hawaii Press, 1991). For a comment on these two authors, see De Smet, "From Catholic Theology to Sankara Vedanta and Return with Fr F.X. Clooney," ''Understanding Sankara: Essays by Richard De Smet'' 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
In one of his last letters, De Smet had given permission for the publication of an updated and edited version of his thesis to George McLean, who worked with Bradley J. Malkovsky towards this end.&lt;ref&gt;Ivo Coelho, "Introduction," ''Understanding Sankara: Essays by Richard De Smet,'' 25, note 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction to the De Smet commemorative volume, Malkovsky indicates that publication is in process.&lt;ref&gt;Malkovsky 8, note 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication is still awaited.

Doctor '''Thomas Hinde''' (July 10, 1737 – September 28, 1828) was [[Northern Kentucky]]'s first [[physician]], a member of the [[British Royal Navy]], an [[American Revolutionary]], personal physician to [[Patrick Henry]], and treated [[General Wolfe]] when he died in [[Quebec]], Canada.

==Overview==
Thomas Hinde is the [[patriarch]] of the Hinde family in the United States.  His youngest son, [[Thomas S. Hinde]], was a notable Methodist minister and businessman, [[Charles T. Hinde]], his grandson, was a shipping magnate, and [[Edmund C. Hinde]], another grandson, was an adventurer. The Kavanaugh and Southgate branches of his family held elected office and positions of leadership in the Methodist church.

As personal physician to Patrick Henry, Hinde played a critical role in the [[American Revolutionary War]] through his vaccinations against smallpox and treatment of wounded soldiers. For his service he received a large land grant in Kentucky, where he moved with his family. Hinde was northern Kentucky's first physician, and a memorial was erected in [[Campbell County, Kentucky]] to honor his services to the state. He died in 1828 aged 91, which was unusually old for the time. According to Otto Juettner in 1909, who was a famous medical doctor and medical historian, Hinde "never wrote a line in his life."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Juettner |1909|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; His life has been described as being like a "romance", and he was called a "patriarch" to the American medical profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Juettner |1909|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hinde was born in [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]], in July 1737.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Methodist Magazine|1827|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a classical education in Oxfordshire and, after completing his studies, was sent to [[London, England]] to study medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Drake |1829|pp=626–627}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied physics and surgery under Dr Thomas Brooke at [[St Thomas' Hospital|Saint Thomas Hospital]] in London and, at the age of nineteen, was presented to the [[Company of Surgeons]] for a licence. Shortly after, he was commissioned as a Surgeons' Mate in the [[Royal Navy]] and sailed for America with the forces commanded by [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|General Amherst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Methodist Magazine|1827|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; After landing in New York on June 10, 1757, he spent time at [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] and [[Louisbourg]]. Hinde spent the winter of 1758 in Halifax and assisted Amherst with the reduction of Louisburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Drake |1829|p=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was attached to the ship which bore the commander in chief, [[James Wolfe|General James Wolfe]], on his way to Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Methodist Magazine|1827|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of General Wolfe==
[[File:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' by [[Benjamin West]]]]
Wolfe died in Hinde's arms during the 1759 [[Battle of Quebec (1759)|Battle of Quebec]] of the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Methodist Magazine|1827|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source, Hinde's relationship with General Wolfe and his experiences in Quebec were some of the most "cherished" experiences of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Drake |1829|p=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; A painting of the death shows Dr Hinde compressing a wound to General Wolfe's torso.It is an [[oil on canvas]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period. [[Benjamin West]], who painted it, made a nearly identical painting of the same scene for [[King George III]] in 1771.&lt;ref&gt;Montagna, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; After Wolfe's death, Hinde remained in the British Navy and was present for the reduction of Bell'isle. Shortly after, Hinde was promoted and remained as a physician for a warship after the peace of 1763. He eventually resigned his commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Drake |1829|p=628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copies of ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' by West are currently in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Canada]], the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] (Canadiana art collection), the [[William L. Clements Library]] at the [[University of Michigan]] and at [[Ickworth House]], Suffolk, England.

==After Quebec==
After the fall of Quebec, Hinde returned briefly to England. Peace with France was reached in 1763, and Hinde then returned to Virginia and settled. He formed a close friendship with an unnamed Virginian who persuaded him to settle in a place called Hobbs Hole in [[Essex County, Virginia]] and practice medicine. Another source states that an aged physician in Virginia wrote to Dr Thomas Brooke, Hinde's mentor, asking Brooke to send a young physician to assist him in his practice. Brooke reportedly choose Hinde and "earnestly advised" him to "avail himself of the situation which was offered". Hinde accepted,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Drake |1829|p=628}}&lt;/ref&gt; but moved soon after to settle in [[Newton, West Virginia|Newton]], now in West Virginia, where he met his wife. After their wedding Hinde moved again and settled in [[Hanover County, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Methodist Magazine|1827|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physician to Patrick Henry==
[[File:Patrick henry.JPG|thumb|left|[[Patrick Henry]]]]
In 1765, after he settled in Virginia, Hinde became acquainted with [[Patrick Henry]] one of the founding fathers of the United States, [[Samuel Davis (politician)|Samuel Davis]], and [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Methodist Magazine|1827|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later he married Mary T. Hubbard, settled near Henry, and became his family physician. His association with Henry and settlement in Virginia helped Hinde become acquainted with many of the leading members of society during the period. When Hinde first met Hubbard, he found her to "possess a great flow of animal spirits, full of humor, gay and lively inner temperament and disposition, with strong powers of mind, and at the same time active and sociable". The couple married on September 24, 1767.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Methodist Magazine|1827|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a biography written by George Coles in 1857, Henry's statesmanlike eloquence and political principles made a strong impression on Hinde and shifted him from being a staunch royalist to a "sturdy republican".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Coles |1857|p=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinde took an active part in the American Revolutionary War serving as a surgeon with Patrick and in various campaigns and battles. At the time of the 1775 [[Gunpowder Incident]], Hinde was Chief Surgeon for Patrick Henry. His involvement in it was the turning point that led him to embrace the cause of the oppressed colonies against Lord Dunmore and the English royalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Drake |1829|p=628}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gunpowder Incident was a conflict early in the [[American Revolutionary War]], between Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of the [[Colony of Virginia]], and [[militia]] led by Henry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Drake |1829|p=629}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hinde originally planned to take a front-line post in Henry's regiment, but when Henry was elected Governor, Hinde was instead appointed to inoculate all members of the continental service. Because of insufficient funds in the continental army, Hinde was forced to cover the costs of inoculations, which "seriously impaired his private fortune".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Drake |1829|p=629}}&lt;/ref&gt; One source states that Hinde amputated limbs during the war by the "cart-load".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Drake |1829|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Hinde continued to live in Hanover County for many years, primarily practicing medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Drake |1829|p=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military land grant==
After the American Revolutionary War, Hinde moved his family from Virginia to Kentucky, having received a large land grant for his services in the war. One source describes the land grant as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;At the close of the war, having drawn no part of his salary, and from his great skill as a surgeon having endeared himself to the Virginians, in settling up his accounts he was presented with a land warrant, to be located in lands selected in Kentucky, leaving a blank within the warrant for the number of acres to filled by Dr Hinde himself. The blank was filled with twenty thousand, and placed in the hands of Patrick Henry to select and locate the lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Redford |1884|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For undisclosed reasons, Henry was unable to complete the land grant to Hinde due to surveying difficulties, who then used his nephew Hubbard Taylor to go to Kentucky, find the location, and complete the transaction. Hinde gave Taylor half of the lands for this service. The land was in [[Clark County, Kentucky]], between [[Winchester, Kentucky|Winchester]] and [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Redford |1884|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to Methodism==
During his early years in England, Hinde was a member of the [[Church of England]], but he abandoned the church as an adult and had become a [[Deist]]. One biographer stated that for a time Hinde "took pride and pleasure in ridiculing Christianity". In later years, however, his religious views "underwent a radical change".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Drake |1829|p=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1798, [[Methodist]] ministers arrived in Hinde's neighborhood and began to convert people. Susanna, one of Hinde's daughters, converted, causing distress to the family. Hinde banished her from his home, and she went to live with her aunt forty miles away. However, this failed because the aunt had already converted, and Hinde's wife converted soon after. Hinde became convinced that the disorder was in their heads, and treated them with medical procedures of the day,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Coles |1857|p=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a "blistering plaster to the whole length of the spine, which he left on for several days". Drake states that, through this "measure of violence, he hoped to deter her from further attendance at places of public worship".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Drake |1829|p=629}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedures were painful, but his wife stated afterwards that "it was a punishment, but I never was so happy in all my life". Hinde later felt guilt for having banished his daughter and performed medical operations on his wife, and he converted to Methodism. His daughter returned home and his wife began attending Methodist gatherings regularly. Two of his daughters married traveling preachers, and another daughter converted to Methodism too.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Coles |1857|p=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of his life, Hinde was a devout Methodist. According to one account:
&lt;blockquote&gt;At another time he was taking a morning walk and met [[James Taylor, Jr. (Kentucky)|Gen. James Taylor]], a relative by marriage, who said, 'Good-morning, doctor; where are you going?' 'I am going to heaven; where are you going, general?' The general, at that time, had some doubts about whether his road led to the same country, and made no reply; but it is hoped he found the way to everlasting life before he left the world.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Redford |1884|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of Hinde's grandchildren states that Hinde built "little houses of sticks and wood" where he would pray. The grandchildren called them "Grandpa's prayer-houses". Hinde could be heard praying from a "considerable distance".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Methodist Review |1871|p=586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Hinde married Mary Todd Hubbard, the daughter of Benjamin Hubbard, an English merchant, and they were married for 61 years. They had eight children that lived to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Drake |1829|p=628}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Ann Winston Hinde married [[Richard Southgate (politician)|Richard Southgate]] on July 30, 1799, in Newport, Kentucky. Hinde and his family were members of the [[Grace Methodist Episcopal Church]] in [[Newport, Kentucky]].

One of Hinde's sons was [[Thomas S. Hinde]], who was a cofounder of [[Mount Carmel, Illinois]], and became a well-respected Methodist minister. Hinde's grandson Captain [[Charles T. Hinde]] was a successful businessman and riverboat captain. Charles was one of the principal investors in the [[Hotel del Coronado]] in [[San Diego, California]], and inspired [[Frederick Hinde Zimmerman]], Dr Hinde's great-grandson, to build the [[Grand Rapids Hotel]] in [[Mount Carmel, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nolan|2011|pp=30–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later life, Hinde lived with his daughter Mary McKinney of [[Newport, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Redford |1884|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1592">The '''Vole clock''' is a method of dating archaeological strata using vole teeth. Investigations at sites across Europe have allowed construction of a detailed framework of how different [[vole]] species evolved over the last million years, and where and when specific species became extinct.&lt;ref name="Currant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/archive/2000elveden_vole.html|title=2000 series: Elveden, Suffolk|last=Currant|first=Andy ([[Natural History Museum, London]])|year=2000|work=[[Time Team]]|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|accessdate=31 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117231521/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/archive/2000elveden_vole.html|archivedate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many sites it is considered the most accurate way of dating, and also provides information on the climate and local environment e.g. in the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name="Currant"/&gt; Dr. Francis Wenban-Smith of [[Southampton University]], a Stone Age specialist on assignment for [[Oxford Archaeology]], described the Vole clock as "one of the wonders of modern science".&lt;ref name="Elephant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehumanjourney.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=129|title=Elephant Hunters|publisher=Oxford Archaeology|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
