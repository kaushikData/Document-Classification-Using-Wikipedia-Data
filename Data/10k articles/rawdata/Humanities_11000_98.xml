[[File:East-Hem 500ad.jpg|thumb|300px|Eastern Hemisphere at the end of the 5th century AD.]]

The '''5th century''' is the time period from [[400]] to [[500]] ''[[Anno Domini]]'' (AD) or [[Common Era]] (CE) in the [[Julian calendar]]. The 5th century is noted for being a period of migration and political instability, throughout [[Eurasia]].

It saw the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], which came to an end in [[476]] AD. The Western Roman Empire was ruled by a succession of weak [[emperor]]s, and true power began to fall increasingly into the hands of powerful generals. Internal instability and the pressing military problem of foreign invaders resulted in the ransacking of Rome by a [[Visigoth]] army in [[410]]. Some recovery took place during the following decades, but the Western Empire received another serious blow when a second barbarian group, the [[Vandals]], occupied [[Carthage]], capital of the extremely important province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. Attempts to retake the province were interrupted by the invasion of the [[Huns]] under [[Attila]]. After Attila's defeat, both Eastern and Western empires joined forces for a final assault on Vandal North Africa, but this campaign was a spectacular failure. 

In [[East Asia]], many nomadic tribes migrated into north-east and central  [[China]], where they established a series of dynasties. This launched a period of division and conflict between [[North China]] and [[South China]].

Towards the end of the 5th century, the [[Gupta Empire]] of [[India]] was invaded from [[Central Asia]] and occupied by elements of the [[Huna people]]s  – who may  have been related to the Huns who had attacked the Romans (see above).

'''Agim Morina''' is a [[Kosovo Albanian|Kosovar]] [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[linguist]], artist, and poet. He is known for his criticism of the official [[Albanian language|Albanian]] orthography, support of a spelling reform, and studies of verb and noun classes.&lt;ref name="foljet-ashash"&gt;Agim Morina, "Kritikë klasifikimit të foljeve në Gramatikën e Akademisë (AShASh)" ''Plisi.org'' [http://plisi.org/gjuhsi/kritike-klasifikimit-foljeve-ashash/] August 12, 2014 (accessed November 13, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Morina views the standard Albanian language as a political project that marginalized the [[Gheg]] dialect and its speakers. He is also critical of language planners for inconsistent rules and for failing to logically resolve whether and where to omit the reduced vowel 'ë'. Wary of radical changes in orthography, Morina urges the free development of written Albanian and believes that Albanian speakers rather than linguists are in a better position to dictate the course of the language. He believes that a reformed orthography will eventually emerge and that many Gheg features that were previously alienated will become part of an enriched standard tongue.&lt;ref name="geg-london"&gt;Ragip Luta, "Çdo përparim i gegërishtes është pjesë e pasurimit dhe lëvrimit të kulturës shqipe" ''Shkoder.net'' [http://www.shkoder.net/fjala/2003/rluta.htm] 2003 (accessed November 13, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Personally, Morina has written in all three literary traditions of the Albanian language—Gheg, Tosk, and [[Arbëresh language|Arbëreshë]].

'''''Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business''''' (1985) is a book by educator [[Neil Postman]].  The book's origins lay in a talk Postman gave to the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] in 1984.  He was participating in a panel on [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and the contemporary world.  In the introduction to his book, Postman said that the contemporary world was better reflected by [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', whose public was oppressed by their addiction to amusement, than by Orwell's work, where they were oppressed by state control.

It has been translated into eight languages and sold some 200,000 copies worldwide{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. In 2005, Postman's son Andrew reissued the book in a 20th anniversary edition.

==Summary==
Postman distinguishes the [[Orwellian]] vision of the future, in which [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] governments seize individual rights, from that offered by [[Aldous Huxley]] in ''[[Brave New World]],'' where people medicate themselves into bliss, thereby voluntarily sacrificing their rights.  Drawing an analogy with the latter scenario, Postman sees television's entertainment value as a present-day "[[Soma (Brave New World)|soma]]", the fictitious pleasure drug in Brave New World, by means of which the citizens' rights are exchanged for consumers' entertainment.

The essential premise of the book, which Postman extends to the rest of his argument(s), is that "form excludes the content" that is, a particular medium can only sustain a particular level of ideas. Thus [[Logical argument|rational argument]], integral to print typography, is militated against by the medium of television for this reason. Owing to this shortcoming, politics and religion are diluted, and "news of the day" becomes a packaged commodity. Television de-emphasises the quality of information in favour of satisfying the far-reaching needs of entertainment, by which information is encumbered and to which it is subordinate.

Postman asserts the presentation of [[television news]] is a form of entertainment programming; arguing that the inclusion of theme music, the interruption of commercials, and "talking hairdos" bear witness that televised news cannot readily be taken seriously.  Postman further examines the differences between written speech, which he argues reached its prime in the early to mid-nineteenth century, and the forms of televisual communication, which rely mostly on visual images to "sell" lifestyles.  He argues that, owing to this change in public discourse, [[politics]] has ceased to be about a candidate's ideas and solutions, but whether he comes across favorably on television. Television, he notes, has introduced the phrase "now this", which implies a ''complete absence'' of connection between the separate topics the phrase ostensibly connects.  [[Larry Gonick]] used this phrase to conclude his ''Cartoon Guide to (Non)Communication,'' instead of the traditional "the end".

Postman refers to the inability to act upon much of the so-called information from televised sources as the [[Information-action ratio]]. He contends that "television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation—misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing".

Drawing on the ideas of media scholar [[Marshall McLuhan]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; altering McLuhan's [[aphorism]] "[[the medium is the message]]", to "the medium is the metaphor"&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; he describes how oral, literate, and televisual cultures radically differ in the processing and prioritization of information; he argues that each medium is appropriate for a different kind of knowledge. The faculties requisite for rational inquiry are simply weakened by televised viewing.  Accordingly, reading, a prime example cited by Postman, exacts intense intellectual involvement, at once interactive and [[dialectical]]; whereas television only requires passive involvement.

Postman argues that commercial television has become derivative of advertising. Moreover, modern television commercials are not "a series of testable, logically ordered assertions" rationalizing consumer decisions, but "is a drama—a mythology, if you will—of handsome people" being driven to "near ecstasy by their good fortune" of possessing advertised goods or services. "The truth or falsity of an advertiser's claim is simply not an issue" because more often than not "no claims are made, except those the viewer projects onto or infers from the drama."  Because commercial television is programmed according to ratings, its content is determined by commercial feasibility, not critical acumen. Television in its present state, he says, does not satisfy the conditions for honest intellectual involvement and rational argument.

He repeatedly states that the eighteenth century, the "[[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]]", was the pinnacle for rational argument. Only in the printed word, he states, could complicated truths be rationally conveyed.  Postman gives a striking example: many of the first fifteen [[U.S. presidents]] could probably have walked down the street without being recognized by the average citizen, yet all these men would have been quickly known by their written words.  However, the reverse is true today.  The names of presidents or even famous preachers, lawyers, and scientists call up visual images, typically television images, but few, if any, of their words come to mind.  The few that do almost exclusively consist of carefully chosen [[soundbite]]s.  Postman mentions [[Ronald Reagan]], and comments upon Reagan's abilities as an entertainer.

Anthropocentrism interprets or regards the world in terms of human values and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anthropocentrism Anthropocentrism] - Merriam-Webster Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; The term can be used interchangeably with '''humanocentrism''', and some refer to the concept as '''human supremacy''' or '''human exceptionalism'''. Anthropocentrism is considered to be profoundly embedded in many modern human cultures and conscious acts. It is a major concept in the field of [[environmental ethics]] and [[environmental philosophy]], where it is often considered to be the root cause of problems created by human action within the [[ecosphere (ecology)|ecosphere]].

However, many proponents of anthropocentrism state that this is not necessarily the case: they argue that a sound long-term view acknowledges that a healthy, sustainable environment is necessary for humans and that the real issue is shallow anthropocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-environmental/#IntChaEnvEth | title=Environmental Ethics, See: 1.

''Ethics and the Environment'' 1&lt;/ref&gt; that anthropocentrism plays an analogous role in green theory to [[androcentrism]] in feminist theory and [[ethnocentrism]] in anti-racist theory. Plumwood calls human-centredness "anthrocentrism" to emphasise this parallel.

One of the first extended philosophical essays addressing environmental ethics, [[John Passmore]]'s ''Man's Responsibility for Nature''&lt;ref&gt;Passmore, J. 1974. ''Man's Responsibility for Nature'' London: Duckworth&lt;/ref&gt; has been criticised by defenders of [[deep ecology]] because of its anthropocentrism, often claimed to be constitutive of traditional Western moral thought.&lt;ref&gt;Routley, R. and V. 1980. 'Human Chauvinism and Environmental Ethics' in ''Environmental Philosophy'' (eds) D.S. Mannison, M. McRobbie and R. Routley. Canberra: ANU Research School of Social Sciences: 96-189&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, defenders of anthropocentrism concerned with the ecological crisis contend that the maintenance of a healthy, sustainable environment is necessary for human well-being as opposed to for its own sake. The problem with a "shallow" viewpoint is not that it is human-centred but that according to William Grey: "What's wrong with shallow views is not their concern about the well-being of humans, but that they do not really consider enough in what that well-being consists. According to this view, we need to develop an enriched, fortified anthropocentric notion of human interest to replace the dominant short-term, sectional and self-regarding conception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grey | first1 = W | year = 1993 | title = Anthropocentrism and Deep Ecology | url = http://www.uq.edu.au/%7Epdwgrey/pubs/anthropocentrism.html | journal = Australasian Journal of Philosophy | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 463–475 | doi=10.1080/00048409312345442}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Plumwood in ''Environmental Culture: The Ecological Crisis of Reason'' argued that Grey's anthropocentrism is inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= Plumwood | first1= Val | year= 2002 | chapter= Chapter 6 Philosophy, Prudence and Anthropocentrism | pages= (123–) 130–142 | title= Environmental Culture: The Ecological Crisis of Reason | isbn= 9780415178778 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=-Aku-jlWZ_4C&amp;pg=130#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | format= Google Books online preview version | accessdate= 12 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to take note that many devoted environmentalists encompass a somewhat anthropocentric-based philosophical view supporting the fact that they will argue in favor of saving the environment for the sake of human populations. Grey writes: "We should be concerned to promote a rich, diverse, and vibrant biosphere. Human flourishing may certainly be included as a legitimate part of such a flourishing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uq.edu.au/~pdwgrey/pubs/anthropocentrism.html|title=The University of Queensland|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a concern for human flourishing amidst the flourishing of life as a whole, however, is said to be indistinguishible from that of [[deep ecology]] and [[Biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]], which has been proposed as both an [[antithesis]] of anthropocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

==Judeo-Christian tradition==
[[Maimonides]], a scholar of the [[Torah]] who lived in the 12th century AD, was noted for being decidedly anti-anthropocentric. Maimonides called man "a mere 'drop of the bucket’" and "not 'the axle of the world'".&lt;ref name=lamm/&gt; He also claimed that anthropocentric thinking is what causes humans to think that evil things exist in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-275-93038-7| last = Dan| first = Joseph| title = Studies in Jewish Thought| date = 1989|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Norman Lamm|Rabbi Norman Lamm]], Maimonides "thus deflate[d] man's extravagant notions of his own importance and urge[d] us to abandon these illusions."&lt;ref name=lamm&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = KTAV Publishing House, Inc.| isbn = 978-0-88125-952-0| last = Lamm| first = Norman| title = Faith and Doubt: Studies in Traditional Jewish Thought| date = 2006|pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1985 [[CBC Television|CBC]] series "A Planet For the Taking", [[Dr. David Suzuki]] explored the [[Old Testament]] roots of anthropocentrism and how it shaped our view of non-human animals. Some Christian proponents of anthropocentrism base their belief on the Bible, such as the verse 1:26 in the [[Book of Genesis]]:
{{quote|And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.}}

The use of the word "dominion" in the ''Genesis'' is controversial. Many Biblical scholars, especially [[Roman Catholic]] and other non-Protestant Christians, consider this to be a flawed translation of a word meaning "[[stewardship]]", which would indicate that mankind should take care of the earth and its various forms of life.

==Human rights==
Anthropocentrism is the grounding for some [[natural and legal rights|naturalistic concepts]] of [[human rights]]. Defenders of anthropocentrism argue that it is the necessary fundamental premise to defend [[universal human rights]], since what matters morally is simply being human. For example, noted philosopher [[Mortimer J. Adler]] wrote,  "Those who oppose injurious discrimination on the moral ground that all human beings, being equal in their humanity, should be treated equally in all those respects that concern their common humanity, would have no solid basis in fact to support their normative principle." Adler is stating here, that denying what is now called human exceptionalism could lead to tyranny, writing that if we ever came to believe that humans do not possess a unique moral status, the intellectual foundation of our liberties collapses: "Why, then, should not groups of superior men be able to justify their enslavement, exploitation, or even genocide of inferior human groups on factual and moral grounds akin to those we now rely on to justify our treatment of the animals we harness as beasts of burden, that we butcher for food and clothing, or that we destroy as disease-bearing pests or as dangerous predators?"&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, ''The Difference of Man and the Difference It Makes'', (New York, Fordham University Press, 1993), p.264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and anthropocentrism defender [[Wesley J. Smith]] from the [[Discovery Institute]] has written that human exceptionalism is what gives rise to human duties to each other, the natural world, and to treat animals humanely. Writing in ''A Rat is a Pig is a Dog is a Boy'', a critique of [[animal rights]] ideology, "Because we ''are'' unquestionably a unique species—the only species capable of even contemplating ethical issues and assuming responsibilities—we uniquely are capable of apprehending the difference between right and wrong, good and evil, proper and improper conduct toward animals. Or to put it more succinctly if being human isn't what requires us to treat animals humanely, what in the world does?"&lt;ref&gt;''A Rat is a Pig is a Dog is a Boy: The Human Cost of the Animal Rights Movement'' ''[https://www.amazon.com/Rat-Pig-Dog-Boy-Movement/dp/1594033463/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1275969161&amp;sr=1-1]'', (New York, Encounter Books, 2010),  pp. 243-244.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive psychology==
In [[cognitive psychology]], anthropocentric thinking can be defined as "the tendency to reason about unfamiliar biological species or processes by analogy to humans".&lt;ref name="Coley2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coley|first1=John D|last2=Tanner|first2=Kimberly D|title=Common Origins of Diverse Misconceptions: Cognitive Principles and the Development of Biology Thinking|journal=CBE-Life Sciences Education|date=2012|volume=11|issue=3|pages=209–215|doi=10.1187/cbe.12-06-0074|url=http://www.lifescied.org/content/11/3/209.full|language=en|issn=1931-7913|pmc=3433289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasoning by [[analogy]] is an attractive thinking strategy, and it can be tempting to apply our own experience of being human to other [[biological]] systems. For example, because death is commonly felt to be undesirable, it may be tempting to form the [[Scientific misconceptions|misconception]] that death at a cellular level or elsewhere in nature is similarly undesirable (whereas in reality [[programmed cell death]] is an essential physiological phenomenon, and [[ecosystem]]s also rely on death).&lt;ref name="Coley2012"/&gt;  Conversely, anthropocentric thinking can also lead people to underattribute human characteristics to other organisms. For instance, it may be tempting to wrongly assume that an animal that is very different from humans, such as an insect, will not share particular biological characteristics, such as reproduction or blood circulation.&lt;ref name="Coley2012"/&gt;

Anthropocentric thinking has predominantly been studied in young children (mostly up to the age of 10) by [[developmental psychologist]]s interested in its relevance to biology [[education]]. Although relatively little is known about its persistence at a later age, evidence exists that this pattern of human exceptionalist thinking can continue through young adulthood, even among students who have been increasingly educated in biology.&lt;ref name="Coley2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coley|first1=John D|last2=Arenson|first2=Melanie|last3=Xu|first3=Yian|last4=Tanner|first4=Kimberly D|title=Intuitive biological thought: Developmental changes and effects of biology education in late adolescence|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=February 2017|volume=92|pages=1–21| doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2016.11.001| url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Coley/publication/310589329_Intuitive_biological_thought_Developmental_changes_and_effects_of_biology_education_in_late_adolescence/links/5835109f08aef19cb81f9614.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that anthropocentric thinking is an [[innate]] human characteristic has been challenged by study of American children raised in urban environments, among whom it appears to emerge between the ages of 3 and 5 years as an acquired perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herrmann|first1=Patricia|last2=Waxman|first2=Sandra R|last3=Medin|first3=Douglas L|title=Anthropocentrism is not the first step in children’s reasoning about the natural world|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2010|volume=107|issue=22|pages=9979–9984|doi=10.1073/pnas.1004440107|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/107/22/9979.long|issn=0027-8424|pmc=2890461|pmid=20479241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's recourse to anthropocentric thinking seems to vary with experience and cultural assumptions about the place of humans in the natural world.&lt;ref name="Coley2012"/&gt; Children raised in rural environments appear to use it less than their urban counterparts because of their greater familiarity with different species of animals and plants.&lt;ref name="Coley2012"/&gt;  Studies involving children from some of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] have found little use of anthropocentric thinking.&lt;ref name="Coley2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Peter J|last2=Brenneman|first2=Kimberly|title=Young Children’s Developing Understanding of the Biological World|journal=Early Education and Development|date=2016|volume=27|issue=8|pages=1103–1108| doi=10.1080/10409289.2016.1220772| url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10409289.2016.1220772|issn=1040-9289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study of children among the [[Wichí people]] in South America showed a tendency to think of living organisms in terms of their [[Folk taxonomy|taxonomic or perceived similarities]], [[ecological]] considerations, and [[animistic]] traditions, resulting in a much less anthropocentric view of the natural world than is experienced by many children in Western societies.&lt;ref name="Marshall2016"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{Expert needed|Science Fiction|talk=|reason=Analysis of global fiction and science fiction without neither source nor examples. Needs an expert of [[Science fiction studies]]|date=November 2016}}
In fiction from all eras and societies, there is fiction treating as normal the actions of humans to ride, eat, milk, and otherwise treat animals as separate species. There are occasional exceptions, such as [[talking animal]]s, but they are generally treated as exceptions, as aberrations to the rule distinguishing people from animals.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2016}}

In [[science fiction]], ''humanocentrism'' is the idea that humans, as both beings and as a species, are the superior [[Sentience#Science fiction|sentient]]s. Essentially the equivalent of [[Supremacism|racial supremacy]] on a galactic scale, it entails [[ethnic hatred|intolerant]] discrimination against sentient [[extraterrestrial life|non-human]]s, much like race supremacists discriminate against those not of their race. A prime example of this concept is utilized as a story element for the ''[[Mass Effect (series)|Mass Effect]]'' series. After humanity's first contact results in a brief war, many humans in the series develop suspicious or even hostile attitudes towards the game's various alien races. By the time of the first game, which takes place several decades after the war, many humans still retain such sentiments in addition to forming 'pro-human' organizations.

This idea is countered by [[Antihumanism#In fiction|anti-humanism]]. At times, this ideal also includes [[Technophobia#Technophobia in arts|fear of and superiority over]] [[Artificial general intelligence|strong AIs]] and [[cyborg]]s, downplaying the ideas of [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#AI equality|integration]], [[cybernetic revolt]]s, [[machine rule]] and [[Tilden's Laws of Robotics]].{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2016}}

[[Mark Twain]] mocked the belief in human supremacy in ''[[Letters from the Earth]]'' (written c. 1909, published 1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=skeptically.org|title=Damned Human Race: Mark Twain|author= Mark Twain|url=http://www.skeptically.org/logicalthreads/id14.html|accessdate=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 documentary ''The Superior Human?'' systematically analyzes anthropocentrism and concludes that value is fundamentally an opinion, and since life forms naturally value their own traits, most humans are misled to believe that they are actually more valuable than other species.  This natural bias, according to the film, combined with a received sense of comfort and an excuse for exploitation of non-humans cause anthropocentrism to remain in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesuperiorhuman.ultraventus.info/|title="The Superior Human?"

The '''Arecibo message''' is a 1974 [[interstellar radio message]] carrying basic information about humanity and Earth sent to [[Great Globular Cluster in Hercules|globular star cluster M13]] in the hope that [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|extraterrestrial intelligence]] might receive and decipher it. The message was [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] into space a single time via [[frequency modulation|frequency modulated]] [[radio waves]] at a ceremony to mark the remodeling of the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo radio telescope]] in [[Puerto Rico]] on 16 November 1974.&lt;ref name="phoneet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Nov99/Arecibo.message.ws.html |title=Cornell News: It's the 25th anniversary of Earth's first (and only) attempt to phone E.T. |date=Nov 12, 1999|accessdate=2008-03-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802005337/http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Nov99/Arecibo.message.ws.html |archivedate=2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20170628"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Steven |title=Greetings, E.T.

The "ones" and "zeros" were transmitted by frequency shifting at the rate of 10 bits per second. The total broadcast was less than three minutes.&lt;ref name="phoneet" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jay M.

Dr. [[Frank Drake]], then at [[Cornell University]] and creator of the [[Drake equation]], wrote the message with help from [[Carl Sagan]], among others.&lt;ref name="phoneet" /&gt; The message consists of seven parts that encode the following (from the top down):&lt;ref name=cassiday/&gt;
#The numbers one (1) to ten (10) (white)
#The [[atomic numbers]] of the elements [[hydrogen]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[phosphorus]], which make up [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) (purple)

Since it will take nearly 25,000 years for the message to reach its intended destination (and an additional 25,000 years for any reply), the Arecibo message is viewed as a demonstration of human technological achievement, rather than a real attempt to enter into a conversation with extraterrestrials. In fact, the core of M13, to which the message was aimed, will no longer be in that location when the message arrives.&lt;ref name="phoneet" /&gt; However, as the [[proper motion]] of M13 is small, the message will still arrive near the center of the cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science20.com/comments/28100/In_regard_to_the_email_from |title=In regard to the email from |author=Dave Deamer |date=December 4, 2009 |publisher=Science 2.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Cornell News'' press release of November 12, 1999, the real purpose of the message was not to make contact but to demonstrate the capabilities of newly installed equipment.&lt;ref name="phoneet" /&gt;

Even assuming that recipients would recognize binary, the encoding of the numbers may not be immediately obvious because of the way they have been written. To read the first seven digits, ignore the bottom row, and read them as three binary digits from top to bottom, with the top digit being the most significant. The readings for 8, 9 and 10 are a little different, as they have been given an additional column next to the first (to the right in the image). This is intended to show that numbers too large to fit in a single column can be written in several contiguous ones, where the additional columns do not have the least-significant-digit marker.

The [[nucleotides]] are described as sequences of the five atoms that appear on the preceding line. Each sequence represents the [[molecular formula]] of the nucleotide as incorporated into DNA (as opposed to the free form of the nucleotide).

For example, deoxyribose (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O in DNA, C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; when free), the nucleotide in the top left in the image, is read as:

 11000
 10000
 11010
 XXXXX
 -----
 75010

i.e., 7 atoms of hydrogen, 5 atoms of carbon, 0 atoms of nitrogen, 1 atom of oxygen, and 0 atoms of phosphorus.

DNA double [[helix]]; the vertical bar represents the number of nucleotides. The value depicted is around 4.3 billion, which was believed to be the case in 1974 when the message was transmitted. It is currently thought that there are about 3.2 billion base pairs in the human [[genome]].

===Humanity===
[[Image:Arecibo message part 5.png|Part 5 — Human form, the height and population of humans|right]]

The element in the center represents a human. The element on the left (in the image) indicates the average height of an adult male: {{cvt|1.764|m|ftin|1}}. This corresponds to the horizontally written binary 14 multiplied by the [[wavelength]] of the message (126&amp;nbsp;mm). The element on the right depicts the size of human population in 1974, around 4.3&amp;nbsp;billion (which, coincidentally, is within 0.1% of the number of DNA nucleotides). In this case, the number is oriented in the data horizontally rather than vertically. The least-significant-digit marker is in the upper left in the image, with bits going to the right and more significant digits below.

===Planets===
[[Image:Arecibo message part 6.png|Part 6 — The Sun and the planets|left]]

The [[solar system]], showing the [[Sun]] and the planets in the order of their position from the [[Sun]]: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], and [[Pluto]]. (Pluto has since been [[Pluto#IAU classification|reclassified]] as a [[dwarf planet]] by the [[International Astronomical Union]], but it was still considered a planet at the time the message was transmitted.)

The Earth is the third planet from the [[Sun]]; its graphic is shifted up to identify it as the planet from which the signal was sent. Additionally, the human figure is shown just above the Earth graphic.

In addition to showing position, the graphic provides a general, not-to-scale size reference of each planet and the Sun.

===Telescope===
[[Image:Arecibo message part 7.png|Part 7 — The Arecibo radio telescope|left]]

 bottom two rows:
      100101
 &lt;--- 111110X ---&gt;

 100101 111110 (binary) = 2,430 (decimal)

{{clr}}

The last part represents the [[Arecibo radio telescope]] with its [[diameter]]: 2,430 multiplied by the wavelength gives {{cvt|306.18|m|ftin|0}}. In this case, the number is oriented horizontally, with the least-significant-digit marker to the lower right in the image. The part of the image that looks like a letter "M" is there to demonstrate to the reader of the message that the curved line is a [[paraboloid]] mirror.

[[File:SangerOnCourtSteps2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Margaret Sanger]], a prominent birth control activist, leaving a courthouse in New York in 1917.]]

'''[[Birth control]] in the [[United States]]''' is a complicated issue with a long history.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of reproductive rights legislation|History of women in the United States}}

===Birth control before 20th century===
{{see also|Womb veil}}

The practice of birth control was common throughout the U.S. prior to 1914, when the movement to legalize contraception began. Longstanding techniques included the [[rhythm method]], [[Coitus interruptus|withdrawal]], [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragms]], [[contraceptive sponge]]s, [[condom]]s, [[Lactational amenorrhea method|prolonged breastfeeding]], and [[spermicides]].&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of [[contraceptive]]s increased throughout the nineteenth century, contributing to a 50 percent drop in the [[Total fertility rate|fertility rate]] in the United States between 1800 and 1900, particularly in urban regions.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, p. 5. Fertility rate dropped from 7 to 3½ children per couple.&lt;/ref&gt; The only known survey conducted during the nineteenth century of American women's contraceptive habits was performed by [[Clelia Mosher]] from 1892 to 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The survey was based on a small sample of upper-class women, and shows that most of the women used contraception (primarily douching, but also withdrawal, rhythm, condoms and [[pessaries]]) and that they viewed sex as a pleasurable act that could be undertaken without the goal of procreation.&lt;ref&gt;Tone, pp. 73–75.&lt;br/&gt;Engelman, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Robertdaleowenindiana.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of a well-dressed man, around 50 years old, circa 1850.|upright|[[Robert Dale Owen]] wrote the first book on birth control published in the U.S.]]
Although contraceptives were relatively common in middle-class and upper-class society, the topic was rarely discussed in public.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, pp. 5–6. Rarely in public: Engelman cites Brodie, Janet, ''Contraception and Abortion in 19th Century America'', Cornell University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The first book published in the United States which ventured to discuss contraception was ''Moral Physiology; or, A Brief and Plain Treatise on the Population Question'', published by [[Robert Dale Owen]] in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, p. 6.&lt;br/&gt;Cullen DuPont, Kathryn (2000), "Contraception" in ''Encyclopedia of women's history in America'', Infobase Publishing, p. 53 (first book in America).&lt;br/&gt;Year of publication is variously stated as 1830 or 1831.&lt;/ref&gt; The book suggested that [[family planning]] was a laudable effort, and that sexual gratification&amp;nbsp;– without the goal of reproduction&amp;nbsp;– was not immoral.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen recommended withdrawal, but he also discussed sponges and condoms.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; That book was followed by ''Fruits of Philosophy: The Private Companion of Young Married People'', written in 1832 by [[Charles Knowlton]], which recommended [[douching]].&lt;ref&gt;Riddle, John M. (1999), ''Eve's Herbs: A History of Contraception and Abortion in the West'', Harvard University Press, pp. 226–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowlton was prosecuted in Massachusetts on [[obscenity]] charges, and served three months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Birth control practices were generally adopted earlier in Europe than in the United States. Knowlton's book was reprinted in 1877 in England by [[Charles Bradlaugh]] and [[Annie Besant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Knowlton | first = Charles | editor-last1 = Besant | editor-first1 = Annie | editor-last2 = Bradlaugh| editor-first2 = Charles | author-link = Charles Knowlton | editor-link1 = Annie Besant | editor-link2 = Charles Bradlaugh | title = Fruits of philosophy: a treatise on the population question | publisher = Reader's Library | location = San Francisco | date = October 1891 | origyear = 1840 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38185/38185-h/38185-h.htm | oclc = 626706770}} [https://archive.org/details/fruitsphilosoph00knogoog View original copy.]&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of challenging Britain's obscenity laws.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; They were arrested (and later acquitted) but the publicity of their trial contributed to the formation, in 1877, of the [[Malthusian League]]&amp;nbsp;– the world's first birth control advocacy group&amp;nbsp;–&amp;#32;which sought to limit population growth to avoid [[Thomas Malthus]]' dire predictions of exponential population growth leading to worldwide poverty and famine.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1930, similar societies had been established in nearly all European countries, and birth control began to find acceptance in most Western European countries, except Catholic Ireland, Spain, and France.&lt;ref&gt;"Contraception", in ''Women's studies encyclopedia, Volume 1'', Helen Tierney (Ed.), Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; As the birth control societies spread across Europe, so did birth control clinics. The first birth control clinic in the world was established in the Netherlands in 1882, run by the Netherlands' first female physician, [[Aletta Jacobs]].&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, pp. 9, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The first birth control clinic in England was established in 1921 by [[Marie Stopes]], in London.&lt;ref&gt;Ahluwalia, Sanjam (2008), ''Reproductive Restraints: Birth Control in India, 1877–1947'', University of Illinois Press, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contraception was not restricted by law in the United States throughout most of the 19th century, but in the 1870s a [[social purity movement]] grew in strength, aimed at outlawing [[vice]] in general, and [[prostitution]] and obscenity in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Tone, p. 17.&lt;br/&gt;Engelman, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Composed primarily of Protestant moral reformers and middle-class women, the [[Victorian-era]] campaign also attacked contraception, which was viewed as an [[Victorian morality|immoral]] practice that promoted prostitution and [[venereal disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Comstock]], a grocery clerk &lt;ref&gt;Dennett p.30&lt;/ref&gt; and leader in the purity movement, successfully lobbied for the passage of the 1873 [[Comstock Act]], a federal law prohibiting mailing of "any article or thing designed or intended for the prevention of conception or procuring of [[abortion]]" as well as any form of contraceptive information.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; After passage of this first Comstock Act, he was appointed to the position of [[United States Postal Inspection Service|postal inspector]] Many states also passed similar state laws (collectively known as the ''[[Comstock laws]]''), sometimes extending the federal law by additionally restricting contraceptives, including information about them and their distribution. Comstock was proud of the fact that he was personally responsible for thousands of arrests and the destruction of hundreds of tons of books and pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comstock and his allies also took aim at the libertarians and utopians who comprised the [[free love movement]]&amp;nbsp;– an initiative to promote sexual freedom, equality for women, and abolition of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Beisel, Nicola Kay (1998), ''Imperiled Innocents: Anthony Comstock and Family Reproduction in Victorian America'', Princeton University Press, pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt; The free love proponents were the only group to actively oppose the Comstock laws in the 19th century, setting the stage for the birth control movement.&lt;ref name=E20&gt;Engelman, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts of the free love movement were not successful and, at the beginning of the 20th century, [[Federal government|federal]] and [[state government]]s began to enforce the Comstock laws more rigorously.&lt;ref name=E20/&gt; In response, contraception went underground, but it was not extinguished. The number of publications on the topic dwindled, and advertisements, if they were found at all, used euphemisms such as "marital aids" or "hygienic devices". Drug stores continued to sell condoms as "rubber goods" and [[cervical cap]]s as "womb supporters".&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===From World War II to 1960===

After World War II, the birth control movement had accomplished the goal of making birth control legal, and advocacy for reproductive rights began to focus on abortion, public funding, and insurance coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, p 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Birth control advocacy organizations around the world also began to collaborate. In 1946, Sanger helped found the International Committee on Planned Parenthood, which evolved into the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] and soon became the world's largest [[NGO|non-governmental]] international family planning organization.&lt;ref&gt;Esser-Stuart, Joan E., "Margaret Higgins Sanger", in ''Encyclopedia of Social Welfare History in North America'', Herrick, John and Stuart, Paul (Eds), SAGE, 2005, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, [[John D. Rockefeller 3rd|John D. Rockefeller III]] founded the influential [[Population Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Chesler, pp. 425–428.&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of global [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] became a major issue in the 1960s, generating concerns about [[pollution]], [[Economic shortage|food shortage]]s, and [[quality of life]], leading to well-funded birth control campaigns around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Tone, pp. 207–208, 265–266.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]] and the 1995 [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] addressed birth control and influenced [[human right]]s declarations which asserted women's rights to control their own bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=Rebecca J. |author2=Mahmoud F.

===The sexual revolution and 'the pill'===
{{see also|Sexual revolution|Sexual revolution in 1960s America}}

In the early 1950s, philanthropist [[Katharine McCormick]] had provided funding for biologist [[Gregory Goodwin Pincus|Gregory Pincus]] to develop the [[birth control pill]], which was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Tone, pp. 204–207.&lt;br/&gt;Engelman, Peter, "McCormick, Katharine Dexter", in ''Encyclopedia of Birth Control'', Vern L.

In 1965, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' that it was unconstitutional for the government to prohibit married couples from using birth control.

Also in 1965, 26 states prohibited birth control for unmarried women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Birth Control|url=http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org|accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 Boston University students petitioned Bill Baird to challenge Massachusetts's stringent "Crimes Against Chastity, Decency, Morality and Good Order" law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=William Baird makes history|newspaper=Boston University News|date=April 12, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, 1967 he gave a speech to 1,500 students and others at Boston University on abortion and birth control.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite news|title=Birth Control 'Crusader' Arrested After BU Lecture|newspaper=The Boston Herald|date=April 7, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave a female student one condom and a package of contraceptive foam.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Baird was arrested and convicted as a felon, facing up to ten years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crusader Baird Faces 10-year Prison Term|newspaper=Long Island Star Journal|date=September 11, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent three months in Boston's Charles Street Jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baird Gets 3 Months For Birth Control Advice to Students|newspaper=Boston Record American|date=May 20, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his challenge to the Massachusetts law, the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts stated that "there is nothing to be gained by court action of this kind.

Baird]]'' legalized birth control for all Americans on March 22, 1972. ''Eisenstadt v. Baird'', a landmark right to privacy decision, became the foundation for such cases as ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and the 2003 gay rights victory ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.

In 1970, Congress removed references to contraception from federal anti-obscenity laws;&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973, the ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' decision legalized abortion during the first [[Trimester (pregnancy)#Physiology|trimester of pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="Roe"&gt;''Roe v.

Burwell'', No. 14–1418, 578 U.S. ___, slip op. at 3, 5 (2016) (per curiam).&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Petitioners agreed that "their religious exercise is not infringed where they 'need to do nothing more than contract for a plan that does not include coverage for some or all forms of contraception'", the Court held that the parties should be given an opportunity to clarify and refine how this approach would work in practice and to "resolve any outstanding issues".&lt;ref&gt;''Zubik'', slip op. at 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court expressed "no view on the merits of the cases."&lt;ref&gt;''Zubik'', slip op. at 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In a concurring opinion, Justice Sotomeyer, joined by Justice Ginsburg noted that in earlier cases "some lower courts have ignored those instructions" and cautioned lower courts not to read any signals in the Supreme Court's actions in this case.&lt;ref&gt;''Zubik'', slip op. at 2–3 (Sotomayor, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Trump administration issued a ruling letting insurers and employers refuse to provide birth control if doing so went against their religious beliefs or moral convictions.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41528526|title=Trump rolls back free birth control|date=6 October 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later that same year federal judge [[Wendy Beetlestone]] issued an injunction temporarily stopping the enforcement of the Trump administration ruling.&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-nws-pa-judge-birth-control-trump-20171215-story.html|title=Federal judge in Pennsylvania temporarily blocks new Trump rules on birth control|first=The Associated|last=Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current practices==

There are many types of contraceptive methods available. Hormonal methods which contain the hormones estrogen and progestin include oral contraceptive pills (there is also a progestin only pill), transdermal patch (OrthoEvra), and intravaginal ring (NuvaRing). Progestin only methods include an injectable form (Depo-Provera), a subdermal implant (Nexplanon), and the intrauterine device (Mirena). Non-hormonal contraceptive methods include the copper intrauterine device (ParaGard), male and female condoms, male and female sterilization, cervical diaphragms and sponges, spermicides, withdrawal, and fertility awareness. 
 
In 2006-2008, the most popular contraceptive methods among those at risk of [[unintended pregnancy]] were [[oral contraceptive pill]]s (25%), female sterilization (24.2%), male [[condom]]s (14.5%) and [[vasectomy|male sterilization]] (8.8%).&lt;ref name="Hatcher20th"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hatcher, Robert D.|title=Contraceptive Technology|publisher=Ardent Media, Inc.|year=2011|edition=20th|isbn=978-1-59708-004-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- page 46-47 --&gt; [[Intrauterine device]] (4.9%), [[Coitus interruptus|Withdrawal]] (4.6%).&lt;ref name="Hatcher20th" /&gt;&lt;!-- page 46-47 --&gt; 
[[Depo-Provera]] is used by 2.9%, primarily younger women (7.5% of those 15-19 and about 4.5% of those 20-30).&lt;ref name="Hatcher20th" /&gt;&lt;!-- page 46-47 --&gt;

A 2013 Lancet systematic literature review found that among reproductive aged women in a marriage or union, 66% worldwide and 77% in the United States use contraception. Despite this unintended pregnancy remains high; just under half of pregnancies in the United States are unintended. 10.6% of women at risk of unintended pregnancy did not use a contraceptive method, including 18.7% of teens and 14.3% of those 20-24.&lt;ref name="Hatcher20th" /&gt;&lt;!-- page 46-47 --&gt; Women of reproductive age (15 to 44) who are not regarded as at risk for unintended pregnancy include those who are sterile, were sterilized for non-contraceptive reasons, were pregnant or trying to become pregnant, or had not had sex in the 3 months prior to the survey.&lt;ref name="Hatcher20th" /&gt;&lt;!-- page 46-47 --&gt; When examining reasons why women do not use birth control, s 2007 Pregnancy Risk Monitoring Assessment System (PRAMS) survey of over 8000 women with a recent unintended pregnancy found that 33% felt they could not get pregnant at the time of conception, 30% did not mind if they got pregnant, 22% stated their partner did not want to use contraception, 16% cited side effects, 10% felt they or their partner were sterile, 10% reported access problems, and 18% selected "other".

===Cost savings===
Contraceptive use saves almost US $19 billion in direct medical costs each year.&lt;ref name=Trussell09&gt;{{cite journal| journal = Contraception| year = 2009| volume=79|issue = 1| pmid=19041435| pages = 5–14| title = Cost effectiveness of contraceptives in the United States |author1=James Trussell |author2=Anjana Lalla |author3=Quan Doan |author4=Eileen Reyes |author5=Lionel Pinto |author6=Joseph Gricar | doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2008.08.003| pmc=3638200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to Most Effective Birth Control Could Save $12 Billion a Year: Study. ... The cost savings from that drop? About $12 billion in public health care costs each year, according to the new analysis.

===Additional benefits===

Contraception has many benefits beyond preventing pregnancy. Combination estrogen-progestin contraceptives can successfully treat dysmenorrhea (painful periods), provide symptom relief from endometriosis, reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and improve anemia related to menstrual blood loss, reduce symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, reduce ovarian and colon cancer risk, reduce moderate acne, prevent of menstrual migraines, and reduce hirsutism (abnormal hair growth). The progestin containing intrauterine device can reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and protect against pre-cancerous changes or cancer in the uterus. Condoms (male or female) are the only contraceptive method which protects against acquisition of sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name=HealthyPeople2020/&gt;

According to the New York Times this October 6 of 2017 "The Trump administration on Friday moved to expand the rights of employers to deny women insurance coverage for contraception and issued sweeping guidance on religious freedom that critics said could also erode civil rights protec[1]tions for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people".

According to the Department of Health and Human Services "two rules rolling back a federal requirement that employers must include birth control coverage in their health insurance plans. The rules offer an exemption to any employer that objects to covering contraception services on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions".

==== Possible new rule under Trump Administration ====
In 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the previous federal requirement for employers to cover birth control in the health insurance plans for their employees. Under this new rule, hundreds of thousands of women would lose their ability to have their birth control costs covered for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/us/politics/trump-contraception-birth-control.html|title=Trump Administration Rolls Back Birth Control Mandate|last=Pear|first=Robert|date=2017-10-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-21|last2=Ruiz|first2=Rebecca R.|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|last3=Goodstein|first3=Laurie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new rule would let insurers and employers refuse to provide birth control if doing so went against their "religious beliefs" or "moral convictions".&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt; However, later in 2017 federal judge [[Wendy Beetlestone]] issued an injunction temporarily stopping the enforcement of this new rule.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt;

==Influence of religion==
{{See also|Religious views on birth control}}
In 2014, the Supreme Court decided that for-profit corporations may offer insurance plans that do not cover contraception, by the rationale that the owners may hold that certain contraceptives violate their religious beliefs. This was a setback for the federal government's attempt to create a uniform set of health care insurance benefits.&lt;ref name="HamelAnnas2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamel|first1=Mary Beth|last2=Annas|first2=George J.|last3=Ruger|first3=Theodore W.|last4=Ruger|first4=Jennifer Prah|title=Money, Sex, and Religion — The Supreme Court's ACA Sequel|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|year=2014|pages=140716140038002|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJMhle1408081|volume=371|pmid=25029337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CohenLynch2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=I.

'''Broadway theatre''',&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Although ''theat'''&lt;u&gt;er&lt;/u&gt;''''' is the generally preferred spelling in the United States (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-re, -er|American and British English spelling differences]]), many Broadway venues, performers and trade groups for live dramatic presentations use the spelling ''theat'''&lt;u&gt;re&lt;/u&gt;'''''.&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known as '''Broadway''', refers to the theatrical performances presented in the 41 professional [[Theater (structure)|theatres]] each with 500 or more seats located in the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]] and [[Lincoln Center]] along [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Pincus-Roth, Zachary.

The Theater District is a popular [[Tourism in New York City|tourist attraction in New York City]]. According to [[The Broadway League]], for the 2017–2018 season (which ended May 27, 2018), total attendance was 13,792,614 and Broadway shows had US$1,697,458,795 in grosses, with attendance up 3.9%, grosses up 17.1%, and playing weeks up 2.8%.&lt;ref name=newleague&gt;[https://www.broadwayleague.com/press/press-releases/2017-2018-broadway-end-of-season-statistics/ "2017-2018 Broadway End-of-Season Statistics"] Broadway League, May 29, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Broadway shows are [[musical theatre|musicals]].

==History==

===Early theatre in New York===
[[File:Park Theatre interior.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Interior of the [[Park Theatre (Manhattan)|Park Theatre]], built in 1798]]

New York did not have a significant theatre presence until about 1750, when actor-managers Walter Murray and Thomas Kean established a resident theatre company at the Theatre on [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]], which held about 280 people. They presented Shakespeare plays and [[ballad operas]] such as ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.&lt;ref name=Kenrick&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/bwaythhist1.htm "John Kenrick article on the history of NY theatre"] Musicals101.com, accessed August 26, 2011 (Copyright 2003–2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1752, [[William Hallam (theatre manager)|William Hallam]] sent a company of twelve actors from Britain to the colonies with his brother [[Lewis Hallam|Lewis]] as their manager. They established a theatre in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] and opened with ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' and ''The Anatomist''. The company moved to New York in the summer of 1753, performing [[ballad operas]] and ballad-farces like ''Damon and Phillida''. The [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] suspended theatre in New York, but thereafter theatre resumed in 1798, the year the 2,000-seat [[Park Theatre (Manhattan)|Park Theatre]] was built on Chatham Street (now called [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]]).&lt;ref name=Kenrick/&gt; The [[Bowery Theatre]] opened in 1826,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/venue.php?id=1073 "Bowery Theatre history, Internet Broadway Database listing"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed August 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; followed by others.

By the 1840s, [[P.T. Barnum]] was operating an entertainment complex in [[lower Manhattan]]. In 1829, at Broadway and Prince Street, [[Niblo's Garden]] opened and soon became one of New York's premiere nightspots. The 3,000-seat theatre presented all sorts of [[musical theatre|musical]] and non-musical entertainments. In 1844, [[Palmo's Opera House]] opened and presented opera for only four seasons before bankruptcy led to its rebranding as a venue for plays under the name Burton's Theatre. The [[Astor Opera House]] opened in 1847. A riot broke out in 1849 when the lower-class patrons of the Bowery objected to what they perceived as snobbery by the upper class audiences at Astor Place: "After the [[Astor Place Riot]] of 1849, entertainment in New York City was divided along class lines: opera was chiefly for the upper middle and upper classes, minstrel shows and melodramas for the middle class, variety shows in concert saloons for men of the working class and the slumming middle class."&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Robert W. ''The Encyclopedia of New York City'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995), Kenneth T. Jackson, editor, p. 1226.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plays of [[William Shakespeare]] were frequently performed on the Broadway stage during the period, most notably by American actor [[Edwin Booth]] who was internationally known for his performance as [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]. Booth played the role for a famous 100 consecutive performances at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] in 1865 (with the run ending just a few months before Booth's brother [[John Wilkes Booth]] assassinated [[Abraham Lincoln]]), and would later revive the role at his own [[Booth's Theatre]] (which was managed for a time by his brother [[Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.]]). Other renowned Shakespeareans who appeared in New York in this era were [[Henry Irving]], [[Tommaso Salvini]], [[Fanny Davenport]], and [[Charles Fechter]].

===Birth of the musical and post-Civil War===
Theatre in New York moved from downtown gradually to [[Midtown Manhattan|midtown]] beginning around 1850, seeking less expensive real estate. In the beginning of the 19th century, the area that now comprises the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]] was owned by a handful of families and comprised a few farms. In 1836, Mayor [[Cornelius Lawrence]] opened [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] and invited Manhattanites to "enjoy the pure clean air." &lt;ref name="Urban Development"&gt;{{cite web|title=Urban Development|url=http://www.spotlightonbroadway.com/broadway-history|website=spotlightonbroadway.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close to 60 years later, theatrical entrepreneur [[Oscar Hammerstein I]] built the iconic [[Victoria Theatre (Hammerstein's)|Victoria Theater]] on West 42nd Street.&lt;ref name="Urban Development"/&gt;

Broadway's first "long-run" musical was a 50-performance hit called ''The Elves'' in 1857. In 1870, the heart of Broadway was in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], and by the end of the century, many theatres were near [[Madison Square]]. Theatres did not arrive in the [[Times Square]] area until the early 1900s, and the Broadway theatres did not consolidate there until a large number of theatres were built around the square in the 1920s and 1930s. New York runs continued to lag far behind those in London,&lt;ref name=longrun&gt;[http://www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-longr.html "Longest Running Plays in London and New York"] dgillan.screaming.net (stagebeauty.net), copyright 2007, accessed August 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Laura Keene]]'s "musical burletta" ''[[The Seven Sisters (play)|The Seven Sisters]]'' (1860) shattered previous New York records with a run of 253 performances. It was at a performance by Keene's troupe of ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' in Washington, D.C. that Abraham Lincoln was shot.

[[File:Crookfinale.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[The Black Crook]]'' (1866), considered by some historians to be the first musical.&lt;ref name=Morley&gt;Sheridan, Morley. ''Spread A Little Happiness:the First Hundred Years of the British Musical'', New York: Thames and Hudson, 1987, {{ISBN|0-500-01398-5}}, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Poster for the 1873 revival by [[The Kiralfy Brothers]].]]
The first theatre piece that conforms to the modern conception of a musical, adding dance and original music that helped to tell the story, is considered to be ''[[The Black Crook]]'', which premiered in New York on September 12, 1866. The production was a staggering five-and-a-half hours long, but despite its length, it ran for a record-breaking 474 performances. The same year, ''The Black Domino/Between You, Me and the Post'' was the first show to call itself a "musical comedy".&lt;ref name=Morley/&gt;

[[Tony Pastor]] opened the first [[vaudeville]] theatre one block east of Union Square in 1881, where [[Lillian Russell]] performed. Comedians [[Edward Harrigan]] and [[Tony Hart (theater)|Tony Hart]] produced and starred in musicals on Broadway between 1878 (''The Mulligan Guard Picnic'') and 1890, with book and lyrics by Harrigan and music by his father-in-law [[David Braham]]. These musical comedies featured characters and situations taken from the everyday life of New York's lower classes and represented a significant step forward from vaudeville and burlesque, towards a more literate form. They starred high quality singers ([[Lillian Russell]], [[Vivienne Segal]], and [[Fay Templeton]]), instead of the women of questionable repute who had starred in earlier musical forms.

As transportation improved, poverty in New York diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, the number of potential patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously. Plays could run longer and still draw in the audiences, leading to better profits and improved production values. As in England, during the latter half of the century, the theatre began to be cleaned up, with less [[prostitution]] hindering the attendance of the theatre by women. [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s family-friendly [[comic opera]] hits, beginning with ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' in 1878, were imported to New York (by the authors and also in numerous unlicensed productions). They were imitated in New York by American productions such as [[Reginald De Koven|Reginald Dekoven]]'s ''Robin Hood'' (1891) and [[John Philip Sousa]]'s ''[[El Capitan (operetta)|El Capitan]]'' (1896), along with operas, ballets and other British and European hits.

===1890s and early 1900s===
[[File:Give My Regards to Broadway.jpg|thumb|Sheet music to "Give My Regards to Broadway"]]
[[Charles H. Hoyt]]'s ''[[A Trip to Chinatown]]'' (1891) became Broadway's long-run champion, holding the stage for 657 performances. This would not be surpassed until ''[[Irene (musical)|Irene]]'' in 1919. In 1896, theatre owners [[Marc Klaw]] and [[A. L. Erlanger]] formed the [[Theatrical Syndicate]], which controlled almost every legitimate theatre in the US. for the next sixteen years.&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/bwaythhist3.htm "Kenrick's summary of New York theatre from 1865–1900"] Musicals101.com, accessed August 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, smaller vaudeville and variety houses proliferated, and [[Off-Broadway]] was well established by the end of the 19th century.

''A Trip to Coontown'' (1898) was the first musical comedy entirely produced and performed by [[African American]]s in a Broadway theatre (largely inspired by the routines of the [[minstrel show]]s), followed by the [[ragtime]]-tinged ''[[Clorindy: The Origin of the Cakewalk]]'' (1898), and the highly successful ''[[In Dahomey]]'' (1902). Hundreds of musical comedies were staged on Broadway in the 1890s and early 1900s made up of songs written in New York's [[Tin Pan Alley]] involving composers such as [[Gus Edwards (songwriter)|Gus Edwards]], [[John Walter Bratton]], and [[George M. Cohan]] (''[[Little Johnny Jones]]'' (1904), ''45 Minutes From Broadway'' (1906), and ''George Washington Jr.'' (1906)). Still, New York runs continued to be relatively short, with a few exceptions, compared with London runs, until [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=longrun/&gt;
A few very successful British musicals continued to achieve great success in New York, including ''[[Florodora]]'' in 1900–01.

===1900–1925===
[[File:Victor Herbert.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Victor Herbert]]
In the early years of the 20th century, translations of popular late-19th century continental operettas were joined by the "Princess Theatre" shows of the 1910s by writers such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]], [[Guy Bolton]], and [[Harry B. Smith]]. [[Victor Herbert]], whose work included some intimate musical plays with modern settings as well as his string of famous operettas (''[[The Fortune Teller (operetta)|The Fortune Teller]]'' (1898), ''[[Babes in Toyland (operetta)|Babes in Toyland]]'' (1903), ''[[Mlle. Modiste]]'' (1905), ''[[The Red Mill]]'' (1906), and ''[[Naughty Marietta (operetta)|Naughty Marietta]]'' (1910)).&lt;ref&gt;Midkoff, Neil. [http://home.earthlink.net/~nmidkiff/dorothyarticles.html "Discovering Dorothy"] home.earthlink.net, accessed August 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with ''The Red Mill'', Broadway shows installed electric signs outside the theatres. Since colored bulbs burned out too quickly, white lights were used, and Broadway was nicknamed "The Great White Way". In August 1919, the [[Actors' Equity Association]] demanded a standard contract for all professional productions. After a strike shut down all the theatres, the producers were forced to agree. By the 1920s, the [[Shubert Brothers]] had risen to take over the majority of the theatres from the Erlanger syndicate.&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/bwaythhist4.htm "Kenrick's summary of the 20th century history of theatre in New York"]. Musicals101.com, accessed August 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the play ''[[Lightnin' (play)|Lightnin']]'', by [[Winchell Smith]] and [[Frank Bacon (actor)|Frank Bacon]], became the first Broadway show to reach 700 performances. From then, it would go on to become the first show to reach 1,000 performances. ''Lightnin''' was the longest-running Broadway show until being overtaken in performance totals by ''[[Abie's Irish Rose]]'' in 1925.

===Competing with motion pictures===

All but the Winter Garden are demolished. The old [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th St)|Metropolitan Opera House]] and the old [[One Times Square|Times Tower]] are visible on the left.]]

The motion picture mounted a challenge to the stage. At first, films were silent and presented only limited competition. By the end of the 1920s, films like ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'' were presented with synchronized sound, and critics wondered if the cinema would replace live theatre altogether. While live vaudeville could not compete with these inexpensive films that featured vaudeville stars and major comedians of the day, other theatre survived. The musicals of the [[Roaring Twenties]], borrowing from vaudeville, [[music hall]] and other light entertainments, tended to ignore plot in favor of emphasizing star actors and actresses, big dance routines, and popular songs. [[Florenz Ziegfeld]] produced annual spectacular song-and-dance revues on Broadway featuring extravagant sets and elaborate costumes, but there was little to tie the various numbers together. Typical of the 1920s were lighthearted productions such as ''[[Sally (musical)|Sally]]''; ''[[Lady Be Good (musical)|Lady Be Good]]''; ''[[Sunny (musical)|Sunny]]''; ''[[No, No, Nanette]]''; ''Harlem''; ''[[Oh, Kay!]]''; and ''[[Funny Face (musical)|Funny Face]]''. Their books may have been forgettable, but they produced enduring standards from [[George Gershwin]], [[Cole Porter]], [[Jerome Kern]], [[Vincent Youmans]], and [[Rodgers and Hart]], among others, and [[Noël Coward]], [[Sigmund Romberg]], and [[Rudolf Friml]] continued in the vein of Victor Herbert. Clearly, the live theatre survived the invention of cinema.

===Between the wars===
Leaving these comparatively frivolous entertainments behind, and taking the drama a giant step forward, ''[[Show Boat]]'', premiered on December 27, 1927, at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)|Ziegfeld Theatre]], representing a complete integration of book and score, with dramatic themes, as told through the music, dialogue, setting and movement, woven together more seamlessly than in previous musicals. It ran for 572 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lubbock|first1=Mark|title=The Complete Book of Light Opera|date=1962|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|location=New York|pages=807–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1920s also spawned a new age of American playwright with the emergence of [[Eugene O'Neill]], whose plays ''[[Beyond the Horizon (play)|Beyond the Horizon]]'', ''[[Anna Christie]]'', ''[[The Hairy Ape]]'', ''[[Strange Interlude]]'' and ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' proved that there was an audience for serious drama on Broadway, and O'Neill's success paved the way for major dramatists like [[Elmer Rice]], [[Maxwell Anderson]], [[Robert E. Sherwood]], [[Tennessee Williams]], and [[Arthur Miller]], as well as writers of comedy like [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Moss Hart]]. Classical revivals also proved popular with Broadway theatre-goers, notably [[John Barrymore]] in ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], ''[[John Gielgud]] in ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', [[Walter Hampden]] and [[José Ferrer]] in ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'', [[Paul Robeson]] and Ferrer in ''[[Othello]]'', [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] in ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' and the plays of [[George Bernard Shaw]], and [[Katharine Cornell]] in such plays as ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', and ''[[Candida (play)|Candida]]''.

As [[World War II]] approached, a dozen Broadway dramas addressed the rise of Nazism in Europe and the issue of American non-intervention. The most successful was [[Lillian Hellman]]'s ''[[Watch on the Rhine (play)|Watch on the Rhine]]'', which opened in April 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Atkinson|first=Brooks|title=Lillian Hellman's ''Watch on the Rhine'' Acted With Paul Lukas in the Leading Part|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1941/04/02/85474481.pdf|accessdate=October 18, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 2, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950–1970===
After the lean years of the [[Great Depression]], Broadway theatre had entered a golden age with the blockbuster hit ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', in 1943, which ran for 2,212 performances. According to [[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|John Kenrick]] writing of Broadway musicals, "Every season saw new stage musicals send songs to the top of the charts. Public demand, a booming economy and abundant creative talent kept Broadway hopping. To this day, the shows of the 1950s form the core of the musical theatre repertory."&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, John.

===1980s===
In the spring of 1982, [[Joe Papp]], the theatrical producer and director who established [[The Public Theater]], led the "Save the Theatres" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;The name of the organization was "Save the Theatres, Inc., as noted in court papers.  See [http://www.arch.ksu.edu/jwkplan/cases/shubert.pdf Shubert Organization, Inc. v.

==Description==

===Schedule===
Although there are some exceptions, generally shows with open-ended runs have evening performances Tuesday through Saturday with a 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. or 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. "curtain". The afternoon "[[wikt:matinée|matinée]]" performances are at 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Wednesdays and Saturdays and at 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Sundays. This makes for an eight-performance week. On this schedule, most shows do not play on Monday and the shows and theatres are said to be "dark" on that day.&lt;ref name=schedule&gt;Blank, Matthew. [http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/110105-Weekly-Schedule-of-Current-Broadway-Shows "Weekly Schedule of Current Broadway Shows"] Playbill.com, August 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sunday&gt;[[Simonson, Robert]]. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/149291-ASK-PLAYBILLCOM-When-Did-Broadway-Shows-Start-Offering-Sunday-Performances "When Did Broadway Shows Start Offering Sunday Performances?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029204123/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/149291-ASK-PLAYBILLCOM-When-Did-Broadway-Shows-Start-Offering-Sunday-Performances |date=October 29, 2013 }} Playbill.com, April 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The actors and the crew in these shows tend to regard Sunday evening through Monday evening as their weekend. The Tony award presentation ceremony is usually held on a Sunday evening in June to fit this schedule.

In recent years, some shows have moved their Tuesday show time an hour earlier to 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name=schedule/&gt; The rationale for this move was that since fewer tourists take in shows midweek, Tuesday attendance depends more on local patrons. The earlier curtain makes it possible for suburban patrons to get home by a reasonable hour after the show. Some shows, especially those produced by [[Disney]], change their performance schedules fairly frequently depending on the season. This is done in order to maximize access to their target audience.

===Producers and theatre owners===
Most Broadway producers and theatre owners are members of [[The Broadway League]] (formerly "The League of American Theatres and Producers"), a trade organization that promotes Broadway theatre as a whole, negotiates contracts with the various theatrical unions and agreements with the guilds, and co-administers the [[Tony Awards]] with the [[American Theatre Wing]], a service organization. While the League and the theatrical unions are sometimes at loggerheads during those periods when new contracts are being negotiated, they also cooperate on many projects and events designed to promote professional theatre in New York.

Of the four non-profit theatre companies with Broadway theatres, three ([[Vivian Beaumont Theater|Lincoln Center Theater]], [[Manhattan Theatre Club]], and [[Roundabout Theatre Company]]) belong to the [[League of Resident Theatres]] and have contracts with the theatrical unions which are negotiated separately from the other Broadway theatre and producers. ([[Disney]] also negotiates apart from the League, as did [[Livent]] before it closed down its operations.) [[Second Stage Theatre]] is the non-profit owner of the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] but is not a member of the League of Resident Theatres. However, generally, shows that play in any of the Broadway houses are eligible for Tony Awards (see below).

The majority of Broadway theatres are owned or managed by three organizations: the [[Shubert Organization]], a for-profit arm of the non-profit Shubert Foundation, which owns seventeen theatres; the [[Nederlander Organization]], which controls nine theatres; and [[Jujamcyn]], which owns five Broadway houses.

===Personnel===
Both musicals and stage plays on Broadway often rely on casting well-known performers in leading roles to draw larger audiences or bring in new audience members to the theatre. Actors from movies and television are frequently cast for the revivals of Broadway shows or are used to replace actors leaving a cast. There are still, however, performers who are primarily stage actors, spending most of their time "on the boards", and appearing in television and in screen roles only secondarily. As Patrick Healy of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Broadway once had many homegrown stars who committed to working on a show for a year, as [[Nathan Lane]] has for ''[[The Addams Family (musical)|The Addams Family]]''. In 2010, some theater heavyweights like Mr. Lane were not even nominated; instead, several Tony Awards were given for productions that were always intended to be short-timers on Broadway, given that many of their film-star performers had to move on to other commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Patrick. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010//06/15/theater/theaterspecial/15tony.html "Time Is Short to See Tony Winners"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Mark Shenton, "One of the biggest changes to the commercial theatrical landscape—on both sides of the Atlantic—over the past decade or so is that sightings of big star names turning out to do plays has gone up; but the runs they are prepared to commit to has gone down. Time was that a producer would require a minimum commitment from his star of six months, and perhaps a year; now, the 14-week run is the norm."&lt;ref&gt;Shenton, Mark. [http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/shenton/2010/06/rewarded-today-gone-tomorrow/ "Rewarded today, gone tomorrow…"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626223256/http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/shenton/2010/06/rewarded-today-gone-tomorrow/ |date=June 26, 2010 }}. ''The Stage'', June 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum size of the Broadway orchestra is governed by an agreement with the musicians union (Local 802, American Federation of Musicians) and The Broadway League. For example, the agreement specifies the minimum size of the orchestra at the Minskoff Theatre to be 18, at the Music Box Theatre to be 9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.local802afm.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Broadway_Agreement%2007_10.pdf "Local 802 Agreement"]. local802afm.org. p. 10. Retrieved August 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Runs===
{{See also|List of the longest-running Broadway shows|List of Broadway shows that have held the title of longest-running show}}
Most Broadway shows are commercial productions intended to make a profit for the producers and investors ("backers" or "angels"), and therefore have open-ended runs (duration that the production plays), meaning that the length of their presentation is not set beforehand, but depends on critical response, word of mouth, and the effectiveness of the show's advertising, all of which determine ticket sales. Investing in a commercial production carries a varied degree of financial risk. Shows do not necessarily have to make a profit immediately. If they are making their "nut" (weekly operating expenses), or are losing money at a rate which the producers consider acceptable, they may continue to run in the expectation that, eventually, they will pay back their initial costs and become profitable. In some borderline situations, producers may ask that royalties be temporarily reduced or waived, or even that performers—with the permission of their unions—take reduced salaries, in order to prevent a show from closing. Theatre owners, who are not generally profit participants in most productions, may waive or reduce rents, or even lend a show money in order to keep it running.

Some Broadway shows are produced by non-commercial organizations as part of a regular subscription season—[[Lincoln Center|Lincoln Center Theatre]], [[Roundabout Theatre Company]], [[Manhattan Theatre Club]], and [[Second Stage Theater]] are the four non-profit theatre companies that currently have permanent Broadway venues. Some other productions are produced on Broadway with "limited engagement runs" for a number of reasons, including financial issues, prior engagements of the performers or temporary availability of a theatre between the end of one production and the beginning of another. However, some shows with planned limited engagement runs may, after critical acclaim or box office success, extend their engagements or convert to open-ended runs. This was the case with 2007's ''[[August: Osage County]]'', 2009's ''[[God of Carnage]]'', and 2012's ''[[Newsies (musical)|Newsies]]''.

Historically, musicals on Broadway tend to have longer runs than "straight" (i.e. non-musical) plays. On January 9, 2006, ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]] became the longest running Broadway musical, with 7,486 performances, overtaking ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Playbill Staff.

===Audience===
Attending a Broadway show is a common [[tourism|tourist]] activity in New York. The [[TKTS]] booths sell same-day tickets (and in certain cases next-day matinee tickets) for many Broadway and [[Off-Broadway]] shows at a discount of 20 to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tdf.org/nyc/7/TKTS&lt;/ref&gt; The TKTS booths are located in [[Times Square]], in Lower Manhattan, and at [[Lincoln Center]]. This service is run by [[Theatre Development Fund]]. Many Broadway theatres also offer special student rates, same-day "rush" or "lottery" tickets, or standing-room tickets to help ensure that their theatres are as full, and their grosses as high as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Blank, Matthew.

===Off-Broadway and US tours===
The classification of theatres is governed by language in [[Actors' Equity Association]] contracts. To be eligible for a Tony, a production must be in a house with 500 seats or more and in the Theater District, which criteria define Broadway theatre. [[Off-Broadway]] and [[Off-Off-Broadway]] shows often provide a more experimental, challenging and intimate performance than is possible in the larger Broadway theatres. Some Broadway shows, however, such as the musicals ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'', ''[[Next to Normal]]'', ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', ''[[Avenue Q]]'', ''[[In the Heights]]'', ''[[Fun Home (musical)|Fun Home]]'', ''[[Dear Evan Hansen]]'', and ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'', began their runs Off-Broadway and later transferred to Broadway, seeking to replicate their intimate experience in a larger theatre.

After, or even during, successful runs in Broadway theatres, producers often remount their productions with new casts and crew for the Broadway national tour, which travels to theatres in major cities across the country. Sometimes when a show closes on Broadway, the entire production, with most if not all of the original cast intact, is relaunched as a touring company, hence the name "Broadway national tour". Some shows may even have several touring companies out at a time, whether the show is still running in New York or not, with many companies "sitting down" in other major cities for their own extended runs. Smaller cities may attract national touring companies, but for shorter periods of time. Or they may even be serviced by "bus and truck" tours. These are scaled-down versions of the larger, national touring productions, historically acquiring their name because the casts generally traveled by bus instead of by air, while the sets and equipment traveled by truck. Tours of this type, which frequently feature a reduced physical production to accommodate smaller venues and tighter schedules, often run for weeks rather than months. Some will even play "split weeks", which are half a week in one town and the second half in another. On occasion, they will also play "one-nighters". The production values, while generally still good, are usually less lavish than the typical Broadway national tour or national touring production and the actors, while still members of the actor's union, are compensated under a different, less lucrative, union contract. The [[Touring Broadway Awards]], presented by [[The Broadway League]], honored excellence in touring Broadway.

===Awards===
Broadway productions and artists are honored by the annual Antoinette Perry Awards (commonly called the "[[Tony Award]]s", or "Tony") which are given by the [[American Theatre Wing]] and [[The Broadway League]], and which were first presented in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/archive/history.html "Tony Awards History"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507103143/http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/archive/history.html |date=May 7, 2010 }} tonyawards.com, accessed February 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Tony is Broadway's most prestigious award, comparable to the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Hollywood]] film productions. Their importance has increased since 1967 when the awards presentation show began to be broadcast on national television. In a strategy to improve the television ratings, celebrities are often chosen to host the show, some with scant connection to the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, Jesse. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E4DC1E31F934A35755C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 "Tony Awards Finish Up With a Fuzzy Surprise; Puppet Musical Wins Big, as Does 'My Own Wife'"] ''The New York Times'', June 7, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent Tony Awards ceremony was held on  [[72nd Tony Awards|June 10, 2018]]. Other awards given to Broadway productions include the [[Drama Desk Award]], presented since 1955, the [[New York Drama Critics' Circle|New York Drama Critics' Circle Awards]], first given in 1936, and the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]], initially presented in 1950.

The twelve volume '''''Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum''''' is the primary reference work for the study of British satirical prints of the 18th and 19th century.  Most of the content  of the catalogue is now available through the [[British Museum]]'s on-line database.

==Description==
The ''BM Satires'' &lt;ref name="DorothyGeorge"&gt; {{cite book|last1=George| first1=M Dorothy |title=Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum |publisher=The British Museum| date=1870-1954| location=London| url=https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofprint07brituoft/catalogueofprint07brituoft_djvu.tx}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprises twelve volumes compiled between 1870 and 1954 and provides a [[catalogue raisonné]] of the 17,000 odd satirical prints assembled in the 19th century by [[Edward Hawkins (numismatist)|Edward Hawkins,]]&lt;Ref name="hawkins"&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Hawkins (British Museum Biographical details)| url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=51568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeper of Antiquities in the [[British Museum]] from his own and other collections.

It includes works by all the leading artists and makers of satirical prints of the period, as well as lesser known and anonymous designers. Notable artists represented include:   [[Henry Alken]], [[Samuel Alken]], [[William Austin (caricaturist)|William Austin]], [[James Bretherton (artist)|James Bretherton]], [[Charles Bretherton]], [[Henry William Bunbury]],  [[Frederick George Byron]],  [[John Cawse]],  [[John Collett (artist)| John Collet]], [[Thomas Colley]], [[George Cruikshank]], [[Isaac Cruikshank]],  [[Robert Cruikshank]], [[Matthew Darly]],  [[William Dickinson (engraver)|William Dickinson]],  [[Robert Dighton]], [[John Dighton]], [[John Doyle (artist)|John Doyle]], [[William Elmes]], [[Francis Jukes]], [[James Gillray]], [[Henry Heath (artist)|Henry Heath]], [[William Heath (artist)|William Heath]], [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]], [[John Leech (caricaturist)| John Leech]], [[Lewis Marks]],  [[Richard Newton (caricaturist)|Richard Newton]], [[Piercy Roberts]],  [[Thomas Rowlandson]],  [[F.Sansom]], [[James Sayers]],  [[John Raphael Smith]], [[C.Starck]],  [[Edward Topham]],  [[Henry Wigstead]],  [[Samuel de Wilde]], [[Charles Williams (caricaturist)|Charles Williams]], and  [[George Moutard Woodward |George "Moutard" Woodward]]. Some works by foreign printmakers are also included.

The catalogue allocates a unique identifier to each print which is widely used as a bibliographic reference to specific caricatures in books about caricatures and in sales catalogues. The identifiers are one to five digit numbers, allocated in sequential order of listing within the whole sequence of volumes, each volume covering a monotonically increasing range of numbers. For example; '''BM Satires 10101''' refers to a print listed in Volume VIII (which covers the range 9693 to 11703) that was published in September 1803, titled ''My Ass in a Band Box''. For each print, the catalogue provides a title, publisher, designer and creator if known, image description, lettering and inscriptions, dimensions,  bibliographic references,  and explanatory notes about the historical context and personages and printmaking technique (e.g. [[etching]], [[aquatint]], [[stipple]], hand-coloured, etc.).   The prints are for the most part in historical order of date of publication, though some appear out of chronological order  in  addenda that appear in later volumes. Within each year, Political and Social satire is arranged separately and sequentially.

There is a prefatory essay to each volume by the editor giving a  historical synopsis of printmaking, artists, publishers and events through the period covered by the volume;  including [[Rudolph Ackermann]], [[Bowles &amp; Carver]], [[Thomas Cornell (publisher) | Thomas Cornell]], [[Elizabeth D'Archeray]], [[John Fairburn]],  [[Samuel William Fores]],  [[William Holland (publisher)| William Holland]], [[Hannah Humphrey]], [[ William_Humphrey (engraver)| William Humphrey]], [[Elizabeth Jackson (publisher) |Elizabeth Jackson]], [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]], [[Thomas Maclean (publisher) | Thomas Maclean]], [[John Raphael Smith]], [[Susan Vivares]] and many others.

==History==
The first five volume of the catalogue were compiled under [[Frederic George Stephens]] between 1870 and 1883, with the assistance of Edward Hawkins, Keeper of Antiquities for the [[British Museum]]. The last seven volumes were the magnum opus of [[Mary Dorothy George]] the distinguished historian of British satire.  In 2008&amp;ndash;12, as part of the British Museum's program to digitalise its collections, all the volumes were scanned and used to form the basis of the entries for the satirical prints in the [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx British Museum on-line catalogue].  Digital images are now available for most of the prints.

==Limitations==
The BM Satires does not include prints acquired since the publication of the printed version of the catalogue (i.e. up until 1954). The British Museum online catalogue includes additional entries for more recent acquisitions.   The printed volumes include only a few images, mostly in the introductory essays.

==Armenian scholar==
Born in London, Dowsett came into contact with expert scholar [[Harold Bailey]] whilst at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse College]], Cambridge University who introduced him to Armenian. After further study (including four years on a substantial British scholarship in Paris), Dowsett was appointed as Lecturer in Armenian at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] in London - the only post in the subject in Britain at the time. In 1965 when the  Chair was established at Oxford University, he was the obvious candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, Sebastian (1998) [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-professor-c-j-f-dowsett-1138923.html Obituary: Professor C.

A centennial '''conservation-restoration of the Statue of Liberty''' (''Liberty Enlightening the World'') occurred between 1984 and 1986. The [[Statue of Liberty]], by French sculptor [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]], is a colossal artwork on [[Liberty Island]] in New York Harbor, and is a part of the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]]. Much of the restoration effort was based on unprecedented restorative methods, as metallurgical repair work on such a large scale had never been attempted. Many scientists, engineers, government organizations, and professional consultants evaluated and dealt with the various problems and tasks facing the restoration effort.

The restored statue was reopened during [[Liberty Weekend]], its 100-year anniversary celebration held July 3–6, 1986.

==Pre-restoration documentation efforts==
[[File:Statue of Liberty frontal 2.jpg|220px|right|thumb]]
The preparations for the centennial celebration of the Statue of Liberty began in 1979. Formed by the [[National Park Service]] (NPS), the custodians of the statue since 1933, to investigate possible development alternatives. A report titled "Analysis of Alternatives", published in December 1980, proposed measures to remedy the certain conditions confronting visitors to the Statue of Liberty, such as the long lines and waiting time to enter the crown of the statue. The proposed measures included the instatement of systems for numbered ticketing and early warnings that would allow visitors to estimate any possible waiting times and to be conveniently advised if and when to visit or enter the statue. The report also discussed ways to streamline ferry access both to and from Liberty Island and [[Ellis Island]]. The early report did not address the ever-deteriorating physical condition of the statue, which was already readily apparent.

The '''French American Committee for the Restoration of the Statue of Liberty''' was formed in May 1981.&lt;ref name=blumberg&gt;Blumberg, B., "Celebrating the Immigrant: An administrative History of the Statue of Liberty National Monument," p.139-140.&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of the Interior (of which the [[National Park Service]] is a bureau) later that month, on May 26, agreed to a working relationship with the Committee. In June 1981, the Committee was incorporated as a non-profit foundation licensed by the state of New York to raise funds for the restoration effort. The Committee hired four French consultants said to have considerable expertise in their respective fields: an architect-engineer, a [[Metallurgy|metals expert]], a structural engineer and a mechanical engineer who were asked to compose a technical report on the physical condition of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, R.S., and Despont, T., Restoring the Statue of Liberty: Sculpture, Structure, Symbol, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The French consultants visited Liberty Island in May, June, October and December 1981, before presenting a preliminary white paper to the National Park Service on the seventeenth of December in Washington D.C., titled "French Technical Report on Restoring the Statue of Liberty".&lt;ref name=blumberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Cliver, E.B. and Baboian, R., "Corrosion on the Statue of Liberty: an overview". In: The Statue of Liberty Restoration: Proceedings of the Statue of Liberty - Today for Tomorrow Conference, October 20–22, 1986, New York City, New York. [Ed. Baboian, R.; Bellante, E.L; Cliver, E.B.], Houston, Tex.: National Association of Corrosion Engineers, 1990, 149 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-877914-12-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report, written with the assistance of a regional historical architect from the NPS, was an attempt to identify and address the apparent problems associated with the statue. In the report, the consultants took note of what they saw to be the most serious problem affecting the statue: that two predominant sections, the torch-bearing arm and the rest platform at the head level, had corroded significantly. The report also alluded to the corroded girders toward the top of the pedestal and the bottom of the [[Pylon (architecture)|central pylon]]. The report also discussed the serious structural problems associated with the long-ago deteriorated insulating layer between the [[copper]] sheet of the statue and the iron bands of the [[Armature (sculpture)|structural armature]], as it had caused the iron bands to corrode. Alterations over the intervening years (1887–1916) to the torch had created such irreversible damage to the integral stability of that segment, that it was advised in the report that the torch be replaced. In order to more thoroughly assess possible damage that may be hidden beneath the layers of paint on the central pylon, the French consultants also suggested that the layers of paint covering it be removed. Two alternative proposals for modernizing the stairway within the statue were also proposed. From these preliminary observations, a number of preservation and replacement priorities were made. The white paper was further assessed and scrutinized by the NPS and other officials at the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] in the nation's capital on March 5, 1982. The director of the NPS was impressed by the report, but also concerned about the future prospects of the Committee’s fund raising efforts.

Shortly thereafter, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior announced in May 1982 the creation of a 21-member '''Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Centennial Commission''' (better known as the '''Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation''') which would act as an "umbrella group" overseeing the French American Committee and the Ellis Island Restoration Commission. The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation would try to privately raise funds for the restoration efforts. A report prepared by the NPS in September 1982, titled "General Management Plan", sought to discuss the fundraising aims and objectives of the newly created foundation, but reiterated most of the proposed measures (concerning the statue) of the earlier 1980 report "Analysis of Alternatives" (such as numbered ticketing systems, etc.).

Earlier in 1982, the French American Committee began looking for U.S. consultants to complement the technical work already begun by the four French consultants. They would need to prepare a detailed diagnostic report to investigate the conditions of the Statue in further detail, as many of the French consultants were unfamiliar with the construction procedures and standards, and the design and business practices employed in the United States. The inclusion of American participation was of obvious and pragmatic necessity to the restoration work that lay ahead. Several architects, structural engineers, and representatives from the NPS were brought aboard on the project. Construction work would be assigned to American contractors, and by July 1983, a joint diagnostic report was completed by the newly joint group of consultants and presented to NPS officials. By December 1983, the American group assumed many of the responsibilities concerning the design aspect of the project, and by August 1984, the American team terminated its contract with the French American Committee, owing to the Committee’s considerable fundraising problems and other related matters.

Just prior to the restoration efforts, there were an insufficient number of photographs documenting the initial reassembly of the statue (when it had been given), and too few photographs documenting the condition of the statue since its construction that were relevant to the maintenance of the statue. The NPS vowed to support the historical documentation effort, and a photographer was hired to photograph the entirety of the restoration—before, during, and after. Owing to this decision, an archive of two hundred large format photographs—both black and white, and multicolor—were developed for NPS and the [[Heritage Documentation Programs#Historic American Engineering Record (HAER)|Historic American Engineering Record]] (HAER). According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE) would also be donating a set of three-dimensional computer drawings of the statue, rendered in the [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) program.&lt;ref name="nyt-1985-12-17" &gt;{{cite news |title=Engineers Fix Original Defects in the Statue |first=Calvin |last=Sims |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/17/science/engineers-fix-original-defects-in-the-statue.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 17, 1985 |page=C1 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings were to aid in the future maintenance of the statue. These drawings were later given to the NPS, and were important in analyzing the wind bearing capacity of the structure within the statue.

==Implementation of diagnostic assessments==

===Early beginnings===

From November 7, 1982, public announcements were made by project officials that the [[Statue of Liberty]] would be completely closed to the public for as long as one year beginning in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Statue of Liberty Will Be Closed for Restoration in 1984 for As Long As a Year |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/07/nyregion/statue-of-liberty-will-be-closed-for-restoration-in-1984-for-as-long-as-a-year.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 7, 1982 |page=50 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue had been closed only once before for such an extended period of time, and that was at one point in the late 1930s. Later announcements stated that the erection of the [[scaffolding]] surrounding the outside of the statue would begin in the fall of 1983, and it was still believed in July 1983 that the restoration would begin sometime in the fall.&lt;ref name="nyt-1893-07-05"&gt;{{cite news |title=Statue of Liberty to Be Repaired Starting in Fall |first=Philip |last=Shenon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/05/nyregion/statue-of-liberty-to-be-repaired-starting-in-fall.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 5, 1983 |page=B1 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPS representatives retracted and revised the earlier announcement concerning the closure of the Island to the public; Liberty Island would in fact remain open and closings would be intermittent and only for several days at a time at most.&lt;ref name="nyt-1893-07-05" /&gt; The restoration would not begin until January 23, 1984. An article from ''The [[New York Times]]'' published the day after, indicated that the 30-month project had officially begun the day before, and that visitors would have approximately two weeks remaining before the statue would be completely enshrouded by the tons of extruded aluminum scaffolding that had just been deposited on Liberty Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Renovation Begins on Miss Liberty |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 24, 1984 |page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scaffolding contract was awarded to a company called Universal Builders Supply (UBS) Inc. on December 14, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=UBS Company History | publisher=UBS | url=http://www.ubs1.com/new-site/gallery2/gallery2embedded.php?g2_itemId=47 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205155353/http://www.ubs1.com/new-site/gallery2/gallery2embedded.php?g2_itemId=47 | archivedate=December 5, 2014 | accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract stipulated that the freestanding exterior scaffold was to be completely assembled by April 27, 1984. The {{convert|240|ft|m}} high scaffolding was designed specifically for the statue, and required ingenuity from its designers, as it could only be attached to the granite pedestal and not the statue and had to accommodate the intricate contours of the statue as well. Furthermore, the exterior scaffolding had to maintain a distance of at least 18&amp;nbsp;inches from any exposed section of the [[copper sheathing]]. The 6,000 or so separate components of the scaffold, made of a high load capacity aluminum (alloy 6061 T6), were unloaded onto Liberty Island on January 23, 1984. To prevent possible rust stains from affecting the exterior [[patina]] of the statue, the pretext was adopted of using aluminum. Screw jacks were used to brace the aluminum against the granite pedestal of the statue. More easily an interior scaffolding was developed made of interlocking pipes held together with friction clamps and anchored to the central pylon of the statue for structural support. The twenty UBS workers often resorted to assembling the interior scaffolding when the severe winds and dreadful winter weather conditions prevented them from continuing their work outside.

===Interior coating removal===

Once the interior scaffolding was installed, a thorough evaluative survey of the interior coatings was executed.&lt;ref name="Gale, F. 1984, p. 63-5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gale |first1=F. |last2=Robbins |first2=J. C. |title=Removal of Interior Coatings at the Statue of Liberty |journal=[[Bulletin of the Association for Preservation Technology]] |volume=16 |issue=3-4 |pages=63-5 |doi=10.2307/1494040 |jstor=1494040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acknowledged presumption of most involved in the restoration was that all coatings would be removed from the interior metals, that repairs would be made, that metals would be recoated, and the interior would be adequately weatherproofed. The preexisting interior coatings on both the secondary wrought iron framework and the wrought iron central pylon would be removed along with the multiple layers of coal tar and paint that had been applied to the internal copper sheathing. A ''New York Times'' article from February 8, 1984, mentioned that the interior copper which was at that time painted "government green" would be cleaned to resemble the [[Salmon (color)|salmon]] color of a new [[Penny (United States coin)|penny]]. That outermost "government green" layer was a vinyl paint applied in 1975.
 
Because certain sections that had corroded were hidden beneath the layers of coatings, no attempt was made to salvage any of the seven layers of paint, (consisting of a base coat of [[Lead(II,IV) oxide|red lead primer]] plus six additional coats) and the two layers of [[Asphalt|bituminous paint]] (a coal tar coating) that had been used as a water sealant in the statues interior around 1911. The three available coating removal methods tested, developed (or not) and implemented (or not) were: thermal coating removal, abrasive coating removal and chemical coating removal. The methods contemplated for the removal of the coatings on the interior copper differed from that of the other interior metals. For the preparation of the wrought iron parts of the statue, an abrasive removal method also known as dry sandblasting was implemented in order to prevent against flash rusting, The low dusting abrasive material used in the dry sandblasting technique was aluminum oxide.

Several coating removal methods for the interior copper were ruled out. According to the evaluative research completed, the abrasive removal method (involving aluminum oxide) could damage the underlying layer of the copper substrate. Highly flammable and toxic chemical removal methods were ruled out, as they would have been far too time consuming and could have negatively affected the delicate patina of the exterior (if seepage of the chemicals were to have occurred).

===Alternative removal method adopted===
















Two researchers, an architectural conservator from [[Columbia University]] and a historical architect working for the (North Atlantic Historic Preservation Center) NAHPC sought to address the attendant difficulties of removing the different layers of paint without further damaging the statue. The researchers finally decided upon an innovative cryogenic removal method, in which liquid nitrogen was sprayed on the paint-covered surface. The liquid nitrogen would em-brittle the layers of the paint at {{convert|-320|F|C}}, causing the cracking paint to lose the adherent properties it once possessed. It was estimated that approximately {{convert|3500|USgal|l}} of liquid nitrogen would be needed for the interior coating removal. According to the researchers, "the use of liquid nitrogen in large scale coating removal was somewhat innovative."&lt;ref name="Gale, F. 1984, p. 63-5"/&gt; The moist squirt gun division of the [[Union Carbide]] Corporation of Danbury, Connecticut, which at the time was "the largest producer of liquid atmospheric gases in the United States", donated the liquid nitrogen for the restoration efforts. The company’s researchers also worked with the NPS in fabricating special tools for controlling the application of the liquid nitrogen.

The [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] method was inadequate for the removal of the two final layers of bituminous coating that were below the surface of the seven layers of lead and vinyl based paints. A small yet powerful sandblasting tool that would sandblast and vacuum simultaneously was developed specifically for the removal of the stubborn coating. The tool devised by the Blast and Vac company of [[Bolivar, Ohio]], was "a standard blasting nozzle inside a vacuum cleaner head". A commercial grade bicarbonate of soda (baking soda), manufactured by [[Arm &amp; Hammer (brand)|Arm &amp; Hammer]] was donated and applied as the cleaning agent that would be abrasive yet gentle on the copper sheathing. The baking soda leaked through the holes and crevices in the sheathing, and was affecting the coloration of the patina on the external side of the statue so the workers would rinse the outer surface of the statue, to prevent the baking soda from turning the green patina of the statue blue.

===Coating and sealant application===

Once the layers of paint had been removed from the interior of the statue, the architects and engineers knew that a coating system far more suitable than any of the preexisting applications that had been used, would need to be implemented to protect the iron of the statue’s interior. The coating would have to be able to provide protection against corrosion in a marine environment and have to have a zero level VOC (volatile organic compound) emission rating. A coating was sought for the sandblasted central pylon and the secondary framework, and found.

In 1970, a patent was awarded to [[NASA]] for a [[Hemimorphite|zinc silicate]] primer coating called K-Zinc 531, the name owing to the ratio of silicon/potassium to water being 5:3:1.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, V., “Coating removal from the statue’s Interior” in The Statue of Liberty restoration: Proceedings of the today for tomorrow conference ed. Baboian, R., Bellante, E.L, and Cliver, E.B., p.121.&lt;/ref&gt; The coating had the following characteristics: it was non-toxic, non-flammable, and would dry smoothly on metals within half an hour of surface application. In 1981, NASA granted the license for the coating to Shane Associates of [[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania]]. In 1982 a company called Inorganic Coatings (IC) based in Malvern, a borough in Chester county Pennsylvania, signed an agreement with the former company to become the sole manufacturer and sales agent of the zinc silicate variant. The protective coating was renamed IC 531, but much like the original coating developed by NASA was a high-ratio waterborne zinc silicate. The IC 531 was used in the restoration efforts to provide a number of the structural elements of the statue with superior corrosion resistance.

==Iron armature system==

===Condition of the iron grid system prior to restoration===

Although many of the [[Armature (sculpture)|armature bars]] were replaced in 1937-38, the restoration effort involved the successful attempt to replace nearly every {{convert|2|by|5/8|in|0}} ribbon like armature bar that made up the unique internal structure of the statue (as the bars are not connected to the copper skin, but are held in place by the copper saddles that are riveted into the copper skin). A ''New York Times'' article from December 17, 1985 indicated that the most serious internal problem with the statue was the corrosion that had taken place in the iron armatures which provide the support to the copper sheathing.&lt;ref name="nyt-1985-12-17" /&gt; Eiffel knew that galvanic reaction would immediately pose a problem, owing to the dissimilarity of the metals used in the statue (copper and iron), which unless insulated would corrode rapidly. However, the method used to try and prevent galvanic corrosion of the armature system had proven to be ineffective. 

The original insulating layer implemented between the copper sheathing and the iron bars was an asbestos cloth soaked in shellac. This insulating and isolating system had separated the two metals when it was constructed, but the ingeniously devised system had broken down over time and was compromising the structural stability of many different components. The insulating layer had lost much of its functional isolating capacity due to exposure to interior condensation, leakage and possibly from other variable atmospheric effects of the marine environment. It had deteriorated into a sponge-like material which merely retained the saltwater as a conductive electrolyte. Hastening the decline of the corroded iron, the buildup of corrosive discharge exerted pressure on the riveted copper saddles that had held the iron bars in place. This created buckling and warping, and further caused the rivets to become disjointed. Rainwater would seep into the holes in the copper sheathing which once held the disjointed rivets. Some of the seams and holes were still sealed and coated with a coal tar paint applied in 1911. The streaks of coal tar paint from when it had been applied 74 years earlier were still visible during the restoration efforts. Black tar streaks from these so-called "weep holes" were running down the exterior of the statue and had altered the patina of the external copper sheathing.

An atmospheric research scientist and a technical assistant from [[Bell Labs|AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories]], developed a greenish liquid composed of corroded copper particles roughly matching the statue's exterior in chemical composition, which was then sprayed over the tar streaked exterior. The sprayed on particles were then left to develop and spread over the streaks and stains. Both researchers, specializing in the study of the corrosion on copper and copper alloys became interested in the restoration efforts and proposed to donate their expertise to the restoration effort as it would afford them with an opportunity to study the effects of the atmosphere on the hundred year old copper structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bell Lab Scientists Working as Liberty's 'Dermatologists' |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 29, 1986 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replacement of the iron grid system===

[[Copper]] was considered as a possible alternative metal for the replication of the "puddled" iron armatures, but was ruled out. The NPS performed tests to assess the suitability of possible replacement materials for the iron bars. 316L stainless steel was selected to replace the approximately 1800 iron armature bars, and [[Ferralium]], a [[steel]]-[[aluminum]] [[alloy]], was chosen to replace the flat bars that connect the secondary framework to the armature. As the armatures provide the structural support for the copper skin, it was determined that no more than four bars from each of four different sections of the statue (for a total of sixteen bars) be removed at any given time. These were then replicated mostly by eye, and the replacements installed within 36 hours of the removal of the original. An [[art restoration]] company working along with a steel contractor undertook the difficult task.

Replacement bars were annealed and sandblasted to remove iron filings and other contaminants that would or could eventually cause the stainless steel to rust, and then dipped in nitric acid for protection. The "long term service behavior" of 316L [[stainless steel]], according to a professor of metallurgy at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] who had some involvement in the early stages of the restoration effort, was not known.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, K., 2004, "The Case of the Lamed Lady Liberty" Design News, 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement bars of the iron grid system were insulated from the copper with a [[polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] (Teflon) polymer resin tape produced by the [[DuPont]] company.

A ''New York Times'' article from May 31, 1986 reported that inspection crews overseeing the restoration efforts had noticed several months earlier that a five foot long armature bar near one of the arms had been stamped with the forty names of the forty iron workers who had installed the armatures. The bar, which had to be replaced, was paid for by the contractors. Before being replaced, the bar was photographed; the image is in the June 1986 issue of [[Smithsonian (magazine)|''Smithsonian'']] magazine.

===Torch===

The torch was removed from the statue on July 4, 1984. An article in ''The New York Times'' from October 8, 1984, stated that the new torch is to be completed in the same manner that the old torch was made in 14 months by ten craftsmen from Les metalliers Champenois based in Reims, and that a workshop at the statue's base on Liberty Island had been made accessible to the public that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Torch of Liberty to Be Built by French |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/08/nyregion/new-torch-of-liberty-to-be-built-by-french.html |newspaper=The New York Times |agency=United Press International |date=October 8, 1984 |page=B2 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural misalignment issues==

===Initial assessments===

Within the copper body of the statue is the structural support system consisting of a 97-foot (30 m) central pylon, which is the backbone of the statue. The pylon consists of four girders with horizontal and diagonal cross bracing systems, which provide support to the secondary framework and to the armature, and a 40-foot (12 m) long extension that supports the raised arm and torch. It had been a well-documented fact at least since 1932 (when the War Department reinforced the arm-shoulder structure), that the support for the shoulder of the upheld arm had been misaligned. Then, it was discovered that the arch that supports the head of the statue had also been misaligned. The cause(s) of the misalignments are undetermined, but a few hypotheses have been suggested. The first hypothesis proposed was that Viollet le Duc—the engineer who initially worked on the project with Bartholdi and who designed the structural reinforcement of the arm and the head (displayed in 1876 at the Centennial exhibition in Philadelphia)&lt;ref&gt;Howe, J., 2002, "A 'Monster Edifice': Ambivalence, Appropriation, and the Forging of Cultural Identity at the Centennial Exhibition", The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, 126:4 p.648.&lt;/ref&gt; had died after having completed those two sections—and had employed engineering methods that differed significantly from those of the better-known bridge engineer Gustave Eiffel, who had finished the remainder of the work on the statue, and who is generally credited for the statue's remarkable structure. The second hypothesis was that the Americans, after having uncrated the different sections of the statue in 1886, incorrectly reassembled the structural framework. The third hypothesis is that the statue’s creator, Bartholdi, was aesthetically dissatisfied when the statue was fully assembled and displayed in Paris on or just prior to July 4, 1884, and that he must have willingly sacrificed the structural integrity for his aesthetic vision.

One of the main architects of the restoration project was initially convinced that the second hypothesis was correct, but according to a quoted and published statement, recent research had convinced him of the veracity of the third hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmore, E.V., 1986, "Engineering Miss Liberty's Rescue" Popular Science, 228:6, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant problems were consequences of poor design and construction choices implemented initially, but Eiffel could not have directly been responsible for such glaring mistakes according to the (same) architect.&lt;ref name="nyt-1985-12-17" /&gt; Computer aided design drawings were used to illustrate how the head and the hand wielding the torch had been misaligned, and how the misalignment had caused the spikes of the crown to damage a section of the torch-bearing arm. The "13 trouble spots of the statue" were visually emphasized in a front page ''New York Times'' article from July 20, 1983. The head was {{convert|2|ft|cm}} off center and the upheld arm was {{convert|18|in|cm}}away from where it was designed to be.

With the computer simulations of the CAD program, the architects were able to assess the likelihood of implementing either of the following options to address the misalignment issue: the option of rebuilding the arm-shoulder connection as Eiffel had envisioned it, or they could strengthen the preexisting misalignment by adding new diagonal bracing and steel plates. The latter option would have the intended effect of further reinforcing the repairs that had been made when the problem was initially noticed in 1932 by the War department when it had jurisdiction over the statue. Regardless, the "finite element analysis" of the computer simulation showed that both solutions would work. Additional supports were also added inside the head to improve overall stability. Hence, the positions of the arm and the head would remain as they had been since they were reassembled on [[Bedloe's Island]] in 1886.

===Preservation objectives===

According to the ''New York Times'', the architects on the project assured the reporter that despite the misalignment, "cosmetic changes" to the statue would not take place.&lt;ref name="nyt-1985-12-17" /&gt; Several commentators on the historic restoration project seemed to have reiterated a similar guiding sentiment: that preservation rather than unnecessary replacement would be the objective of the current restoration effort. This was quite reassuring, in the light of proposals put forward early on during the restoration efforts such as the following: "cleaning and polishing of the statue’s exterior; demolition of the statue, selling of the copper and the use of the funds raised to build an exact duplicate in fiberglass; the application of an epoxy coating to the exterior and the construction of a competing monument..."&lt;ref&gt;Bellante, E.l., and Cliver, E.B, 1987 "Restoring the Statue of Liberty: Construction or Conservation?" In: Old cultures in New Worlds 8th ICOMOS General Assembly and International Symposium. Programme report - Compte rendu. US/ICOMOS, Washington, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''New York Times'' article from February 8, 1984 mentioned that the idea to have an elevator that would reach to the crown of the statue had been recently abandoned. A double level hydraulic glass elevator would be installed inside the base of the statue from which visitors would be able to access the crown by ascending a few steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Interior Restoration Set at the Statue of Liberty |first=Jane |last=Perlez |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/08/nyregion/interior-restoration-set-at-the-statue-of-liberty.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 8, 1984 |page=B3 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the interior had been reconstructed, with a great deal of emphasis placed on enhancing the visitors experience, as the original structure was not devised with the visitor in mind, poor lighting conditions, no ventilation and a very inadequate and basic heating system were to be changed.

Prior to the restoration, much of the internal structure of the statue was out of sight behind the mesh wire walls of the original helical stairs. It should be noted that the stairs were originally intended for workmen. Neither the architect nor the artist had envisioned that the lady would welcome visitors internally. Elevators were first installed in 1908–9. A ''New York Times'' article published less than a month and a half from the centennial celebration, discussed the changes within the statue as being the most spectacular. The journalist added: that "now that the walls have been removed, what is revealed is an interior that seems to combine the toughness of 19th century industrial construction and the grace of a cathedral."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Triumph of Restoration Enters Its Final, Fenzied Weeks - For Miss Liberty, A New Grandeur |first=Paul |last=Goldberger |authorlink=Paul Goldberger |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/27/nyregion/triumph-restoration-enters-its-final-frenzied-weeks-for-miss-liberty-new.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 27, 1986 |page=B1 |accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Curitiba''' (&lt;small&gt;[[Old Tupi language|Tupi]]:&lt;/small&gt; "Araucaria Nut Land", {{IPA-pt|kuɾiˈtʃibɐ|br}})&lt;ref&gt;The [[European Portuguese]] pronunciation is {{IPA-pt|kuɾiˈtiβɐ|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the capital and largest city of the [[States of Brazil|Brazilian state]] of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]. The city's population numbered approximately 1,879,355 people {{As of|2015|lc=y}}, making it the [[List of cities in Brazil by population|eighth most populous city in the country]], and the largest in Brazil's [[South Region, Brazil|South Region]]. The Curitiba [[Metropolitan area]] comprises 26 [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba-parana.com/geografia-mapas/mapa-regiao-curitiba.htm |title=Mapa da Região Metropolitana de Curitiba&amp;nbsp;– Paraná |publisher=Curitiba-parana.com |date= |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a total population of over 3.2&amp;nbsp;million ([[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] estimate in 2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/censo2010/populacao_por_municipio.shtm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614165617/http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/censo2010/populacao_por_municipio.shtm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 June 2011|title=IBGE :: Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística|date=14 June 2011|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the seventh most populous in the country.

Curitiba is an important cultural, political, and economic centre in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnestrangeiros.com.br/#!location/galleryPage|title=Curitiba|website=Rnestrangeiros.com.br|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city sits on a [[plateau]] at {{convert|932|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. It is located {{convert|105|km|mi}} west of the seaport of [[Paranaguá]] and is served by the [[Afonso Pena International Airport|Afonso Pena International]] and [[Bacacheri Airport|Bacacheri]] airports. The city hosts the [[Federal University of Paraná]], established in 1912.

In the 1700s, Curitiba possessed a favorable location between [[cattle]]-breeding country and marketplaces, leading to a successful cattle trade and the city's first major expansion. Later, between 1850 and 1950, it grew due to [[logging]] and [[agricultural expansion]] in the Paraná State (first [[Araucaria]] logging, later [[mate (beverage)|mate]] and [[coffee]] cultivation and in the 1970s wheat, corn and [[soybean]] cultivation). In the 1850s, waves of [[European Brazilian|European immigrants]] arrived in Curitiba, mainly [[German Brazilian|Germans]], [[Italian Brazilian|Italians]], [[Polish Brazilian|Poles]] and [[Ukrainians of Brazil|Ukrainians]], contributing to the city's economic and cultural development.&lt;ref name="curitiba-parana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba-parana.net/tradicoes.htm |title=Tradições Culturais|publisher=Curitiba-parana.net |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011|language=portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, only smaller numbers of foreign immigrants arrive, primarily from [[Middle East]]ern&lt;ref name="paimeas"&gt;{{cite web |title=A imigração árabe muçulmana em Curitiba |publisher=Etni-cidade |language=Portuguese |accessdate=3 October 2008 |url=http://www.etni-cidade.net/2008/a_imigracao_arabe.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205114702/http://www.etni-cidade.net/2008/a_imigracao_arabe.htm |archive-date=5 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other South American countries.

The biggest expansion occurred after the 1960s, with innovative [[urban planning]] that changed the population size from some hundreds of thousands to more than a million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dados do IBGE sobre Curitiba |publisher=IBGE |language=Portuguese |accessdate=31 July 2011 |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/painel/painel.php?codmun=410690#}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curitiba's economy is based on industry and services and is the fourth largest in [[Economy of Brazil|Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cidades Brasileiras, Curitiba |publisher=SuaPesquisa|language=Portuguese |accessdate=31 July 2011 |url=http://www.suapesquisa.com/cidadesbrasileiras/cidade_curitiba.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic growth occurred in parallel to a substantial inward flow of Brazilians from other cities of the country, as approximately half of the city's population was not born in Curitiba.&lt;ref name="estra"&gt;{{cite web |title=Quase metade de Curitiba é dos "estrangeiros" |publisher=Bem Paraná |language=Portuguese |accessdate=6 August 2008 |url=http://www.bemparana.com.br/index.php?n=23799&amp;t=quase-metade-de-curitiba-e-dosestrangeiros}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curitiba sports one of the few high Brazilian [[Human Development Index]] readings at 0.856, and in 2010 was awarded the Global Sustainable City Award, given to cities and municipalities that excel in sustainable urban development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globeaward.org/winner-city-2010.html |title=The Brazilian city Curitiba awarded the Globe Sustainable City Award 2010 |publisher=globeforum.com |date= |accessdate=7 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714212832/http://globeaward.org/winner-city-2010.html |archive-date=14 July 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to US magazine ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', Curitiba is the best "Brazilian Big City" in which to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nearshoreamericas.com/brazil-outsourcing-curibita-comes-on-strong-as-silicon-valley-south/ |title=Brazil Outsourcing: Curitiba Comes On Strong as ‘Silicon Valley South’ |publisher=Nearshore Americas |date= |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestcitiestolivein.net/curitiba-brazil-the-best-city-to-live-in-south-america-a-melhor-cidade-do-brasil.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723101730/http://www.bestcitiestolivein.net/curitiba-brazil-the-best-city-to-live-in-south-america-a-melhor-cidade-do-brasil.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 July 2012 |title=Bestcitiestolivein.net |publisher=Bestcitiestolivein.net |date= |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curitiba crime rate is considered low by Brazilian standards and the city is considered one of the safest cities in Brazil for youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetasustentavel.abril.com.br/album/10-capitais-mais-seguras-jovens-brasil-indice-vulnerabilidade-violencia-734424.shtml?&amp;foto=4|title=As 10 capitais mais seguras para os jovens do Brasil|website=Planetasustentavel.abril.com.br|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is also the best to invest in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istoedinheiro.com.br/noticias/economia/20150918/curitiba-eleita-melhor-cidade-brasil-pelo-ranking-istoe-austin-ratings/300248|title=Curitiba é eleita a melhor cidade do Brasil pelo ranking Istoé/Austin Ratings - ISTOÉ DINHEIRO|date=18 September 2015|website=Istoedinheiro.com.br|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curitiba was one of the host cities of the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]], and again for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. Despite its good social indicators, the city has a higher unemployment rate compared to other cities in the state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/economia/pos-e-carreira/por-que-o-mercado-de-trabalho-de-curitiba-ainda-continua-demitindo-868i7lb2m3rmofjytl3yhy1l5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
[[File:Curitiba Centro.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Batel and Água Verde neighborhoods]]
One theory is that the name "Curitiba" comes from the [[Tupi language|Tupi]] words ''kurí tyba'', "many pine seeds" due to the large number of pinecones of [[Araucaria angustifolia|Paraná pines]] in the region prior to its founding.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Fenianos, E. (2003) ''Almanaque Kur'yt'yba'', Curitiba: Univer Cidade, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Another version, also using words from the Tupi language, is that it originates in the combination of ''kurit'' (pine tree) and ''yba'' (large amount).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inf.ufpr.br/sibgrapi2004/site.html |title=Curitiba name origin |publisher=Inf.ufpr.br |date=20 October 2004 |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese, who founded a settlement on the site in 1693, named it "Vila da Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais" (Village of "Our Lady of the Light" of the Pines). The name was changed to "Curitiba" in 1721. Curitiba officially became a town in 1812, spelling its name as "Curityba." An alternative spelling was "Coritiba." This was used in press and state documents. A state decree in 1919 settled the dispute by adopting "Curitiba."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Curitiba}}
[[File:Mapa Curitiba 1894 CR493.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Curitiba in 1894 (Portuguese edition).]]
At the end of the 17th century, Curitiba's agriculture was only for subsistence and its main economic activities were mineral extraction.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Waves of European immigrants arrived after 1850, mainly Poles, Italians, Germans (mostly from Russia) and Ukrainians.&lt;ref name="curitiba-parana"/&gt;

Cattlemen drove their herds from [[Rio Grande do Sul]] to the state of [[State of São Paulo|São Paulo]], turning Curitiba into an important intermediate trading post.&lt;ref name="pr2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/idioma/ingles/historia|title=History of the City |last= | publisher =Curitiba |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Curitiba-view.jpg|thumb|right|Nossa Senhora da Luz Cathedral and Downtown Curitiba in 1900.]]
The [[Paranaguá]]-Curitiba railroad was opened in 1885.&lt;ref name="pr2"/&gt;

Around the beginning of the 20th century, Curitiba benefited from the wealth of the [[yerba mate]] mills. The owners (known as ''"barões da erva-mate"'') built mansions in the capital. These have mostly been preserved in the districts of Batel and Alto da Glória.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/haus/estilo-cultura/as-casas-dos-baroes-curitibanos/|title=Palacetes suntuosos do início do século foram inspirados em referências trazidas pelos ervateiros de suas viagens à Europa|date=2015-11-03|work= [[Gazeta do Povo]] | publisher = grp.com|access-date=2018-05-21|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s and 1950s, [[Alfred Agache (architect)|Alfred Agache]], co-founder of the French Society for Urban Studies, was hired to produce its first [[city plan]]. It emphasized a "star" of [[boulevard]]s, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. It was followed in part, but the plan was too expensive to complete.&lt;ref name="agac"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Agache Plan|publisher=Prefeitura Municipal de Curitiba|accessdate=12 August 2008 |url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/Paginas/ENG/Default.aspx?idf=532&amp;servico=40}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

===Climate===
[[File:AmorMaternoJBCuritiba.JPG|thumb|Fog in the Botanical Garden.]]
Curitiba has a [[subtropical highland climate]] (a form of oceanic or maritime temperate climate) (''Cfb''), according to the [[Köppen classification]] and the Brazilian government classification. Located in [[Southern Brazil]], the humid city lies in a [[temperate zone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esisaocarlosborromeo.com.br/conteudo_detalhes.asp?cod_conteudo=151 Climate of Curitiba]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on a plateau and the flat terrain with flooded areas contribute to its mild and damp winter, with an average minimum temperature of {{convert|7|C|F}} in the coldest month, occasionally falling below {{convert|0|C|F}} on the coldest nights. During summertime, the average temperature is around {{convert|25|C|F}} at daytime, but it can get above {{convert|30|C|F}} on the hottest days. Snowfall was experienced in 1889, 1892, 1912, 1928 (two days), 1942, 1955, 1957, 1962, 1975, 1988 and again in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SYNOP: SUMMARIZED DATA FOR CURITIBA|url=http://www.mundomanz.com/meteo_p/byind?countr=BRASIL&amp;ind=83840&amp;year=2013&amp;month=07&amp;day=24&amp;n_days=3&amp;time=all&amp;l=1&amp;trans=PA&amp;action=display|publisher=Mundomanz|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=METAR: Weather History for Curitiba, Brazil|url=http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/SBCT/2013/7/23/DailyHistory.html?theprefset=SHOWMETAR&amp;theprefvalue=1|publisher=Weather Underground|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terrain's flatness hinders water drainage after rain, therefore providing water vapor for the atmosphere. Cold fronts come year round, often from [[Antarctica]] and Argentina, bringing tropical storms in summer and cold winds in the winter. They can move very quickly, with no more than one day between the start of the southern winds and the start of rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bemparana.com.br/index.php?n=75493&amp;t=frente-fria-traz-chuva-ao-parana-e-aumenta-taxas-de-umidade |title=Frente fria traz chuva ao Paraná e aumenta taxas de umidade |publisher=Bemparana.com.br |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curitiba's weather is also influenced by the dry air masses that dominate Brazil's midwest most of the year, bringing hot and dry weather, sometimes even in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.rpc.com.br/gazetadopovo/vidaecidadania/conteudo.phtml?tl=1&amp;id=778839&amp;tit=Inverno-vai-ser-mais-seco-e-mais-frio-que-o-do-ano-passado |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731124345/http://portal.rpc.com.br/gazetadopovo/vidaecidadania/conteudo.phtml?tl=1&amp;id=778839&amp;tit=Inverno-vai-ser-mais-seco-e-mais-frio-que-o-do-ano-passado |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 July 2012 |title=Winter of Curitiba is dry and cold |publisher=Portal.rpc.com.br |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetation===

Curitiba is located in the area of the Ombrophilous Mixed Forest (also known as [[Araucaria moist forests]]), a sub-type of the [[Atlantic Forest]]. In Curitiba it is possible to find steppes, forests and other formations. The local vegetation consists of remnants of the Paraná (or Brazilian) pine (''[[Araucaria angustifolia]]''), which resisted the efforts of settlers. The Paraná pines are in private and public areas and are protected from logging. The Municipal Secretariat of the Environment maintains a [[botanical garden]] and three [[greenhouse]]s that produce 150,000 native and exotic seedlings: 16,000 fruit trees, 260,000 flowers, foliage and underbrush specimens and the maintenance of another 350,000 seedlings.&lt;ref name="casecwb"&gt;{{cite web |title= City of Curitiba, Brazil|publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity |accessdate=23 May 2008 |url=http://www.cbd.int/authorities/casestudy/curitiba.}} {{Dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curitiba's green area itself matches the size of other large Brazilian cities. The vegetation of Curitiba encompasses a large population of purple and yellow ''ipês'' ([[tabebuia]]s), making a beautiful sight during flowering at winter's end. The yellow ipê is the city's most common tree.&lt;ref name="arvct"&gt;{{cite web |title=Livro mostra roteiros das árvores de Curitiba/Pr |publisher=Ambiente Brasil |language=Portuguese |accessdate=25 May 2005 |url=http://www.ambientebrasil.com.br/noticias/index.php3?action=ler&amp;id=18883 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019045953/http://www.ambientebrasil.com.br/noticias/index.php3?action=ler&amp;id=18883 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrography===
[[File:Rio iguaçu curitiba.jpg|thumb|Iguaçu River, running by the south region of the city.]]
The [[drainage basin|catchment area]] of Curitiba consists of rivers and streams that cross the city in different directions, grouped in six river basins. The main rivers that form the city's [[Drainage basin|watershed]] are: Atuba River, Belém River, Barigüi River, Passaúna River, Ribeirão dos Padilhas and the [[Iguaçu River]], all with characteristics of [[dendritic drainage]]. Curitiba has been working since the 1970s on alternatives to minimize the negative impacts of [[wikt:urbanization|urbanization]] on rivers. An example is the construction of parks along the rivers with artificial lakes, which absorb and retain water for longer periods of time, minimizing floods.&lt;ref name="casecwb"/&gt;
After many studies of local water flows, most rivers were found to be subject to a [[Canalized|canalization]] process. Other alternatives developed to minimize the negative effects of urbanization are the implementation of programs for environmental education, inspection and monitoring, elaboration and application of legislation and infrastructure works.&lt;ref name="casecwb"/&gt;

===Topography===
[[File:Curitiba vista serra do mar.jpg|thumb|left|The Mountain Range of the Sea, ''"Serra do Mar."'']]

The city covers {{convert|432.17|km2|2|abbr=out}} on the First Plateau of Paraná. Curitiba has a [[topography]] of smooth, rounded hills, giving it a relatively regular shape. The city has an average altitude of {{convert|934.6|m|ft}} above sea level. The highest point is to the north at {{convert|1021|m|ft}}, and with lower altitudes at {{convert|864|m|ft}} to the south. Mountain ranges and sets of [[rocky]] hills surround parts of the city, including the ''Serra do Mar'', a hill range between the shore of the Atlantic Ocean and the First Plateau in Paraná.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Government==
[[File:Palácio 29 de Março Curitiba Paraná Brasil.jpg|thumb|right|The Curitiba City Hall]]
{{As of|2017}}, the mayor is Rafael Greca, who replaced Gustavo Fruet. The [[City Council]] of Curitiba has 38 councillors elected since 2004. Curitiba is divided into nine regional governments (equivalent to [[subprefecture]]), who manage the municipality's 75 districts. The ''Rua da Cidadania'' ("Street of Citizenship") is the symbol of administrative decentralization; it is a reference point and a meeting place. Several units are annexed to public transport terminals. Their nuclei offer services in the local, [[States of Brazil|state]] and [[Federal republic|federal]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoohara.com/travel-guide-curitiba-parana-state-vacations-government|title=Curitiba, Brazil Travel Guide - Government - Zoohara|website=Zoohara.com|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jaime Lerner]] is perhaps Curitiba's best-known mayor. He has been mayor three times, the first time in the early 1970s. His leadership was crucial to some major changes in the city. Curitiba has built parks instead of canals to reduce flooding; used parks to make the city more liveable; pedestrianised the downtown area; invented and built Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), a bus system that works like a light rail system but is 10 times cheaper; and started a massive recycling scheme that included giving people bus tokens in return for waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citiesforpeople.net/cities/curitiba.html|title=Sitemap - ダポキセチンで早漏改善！|website=Citiesforpeople.net|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time magazine]] listed this former [[mayor]] among the world's most influential thinkers of 2010. In the days before free, direct elections, mayors were political appointees who were no more than pawns in the game of power politics and were subject to replacement at any time. For an idealistic young architect like Lerner, retaining the mayor's office was particularly precarious. Those holding the reins of power at the time were under the mistaken impression that Lerner's youth would make him easy to control. As it turned out, he was no [[wikt:milquetoast|milquetoast]], and subsequently set about enthusiastically pursuing reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cw.com.tw/article.do?action=show&amp;id=13718&amp;offset=0|title=Former Curitiba Mayor Jaime Lerner|website=English.cw.com.tw|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|2010 IBGE Census]], 1,678,965 people resided in the city of Curitiba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br:80/dados_divulgados/index.php?uf=41 2010 IGBE Census]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502213333/http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/dados_divulgados/index.php?uf=41 |date=2 May 2012 }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The census revealed 1,381,938 [[White Brazilian|White]] people (78.9%), 294,127 [[Pardo]] ([[Multiracial#Brazil|Multiracial]]) people (16.8%), 49,978 [[Afro-Brazilian|Black]] people (2.9%), 23,138 [[Asian Brazilian|Asian]] people (1.4%), 2,693 [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] people (0.2%).&lt;ref name="ibge"&gt;[http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/painel/?nivel=mn 2010 IGBE Census] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Curitiba was Brazil's 8th most populous city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2010/11/04/maiores-cidades-do-brasil-crescem-menos-do-que-resto-do-pais-aponta-censo.jhtm|title=Maiores cidades do Brasil crescem menos do que média nacional, aponta Censo - Notícias - Cotidiano|website=Noticias.uol.com.br|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the city had 359,201 opposite-sex couples and 974 [[same-sex couple]]s. The population of Curitiba was 52.3% female and 47.7% male.&lt;ref name="ibge"/&gt;

As with most of [[Southern Brazil]]'s population, Curitiba is mostly inhabited by European descendents. The first Europeans to arrive were of [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] origin, during the 17th century. They [[interracial marriage|intermarried]] with the [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|native people]] and with the African [[slave]]s.&lt;ref name="pr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/pmc/curitiba/index.asp?noframe=sim&amp;conteudo=imigra/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703141121/http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/pmc/curitiba/index.asp?noframe=sim&amp;conteudo=imigra%2Findex.html |archivedate=3 July 2007 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=3 July 2007 |accessdate=16 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until the 19th century, the inhabitants of the city of Curitiba were natives and mixed-race, Portuguese and Spanish immigrants. In 1808 foreigners were granted the right to ownership of land, and in 1853 Parana became an independpent province, and these events resulted in a substantial number so of immigrants from Europe.&lt;ref name="pr2"/&gt;

The first non-Iberic (Portuguese and Spaniard) immigrants to come to the city were [[German Brazilian|German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/idioma/ingles/curitibano|title=The 'Curitibano|publisher=Prefeitura de Curitiba|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Memorial of Polish Immigration was inaugurated on 13 December 1980, after the visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] in June. Its area is {{convert|46000|m2}} and was part of the former Candles plant. The seven wooden log houses are parts of this memorial area, as a memento of the Polish immigrants' struggles and faith. Objects like an old wagon, pipe of cabbage and a print of the [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]] (patron saint of the [[Polish people]]), form parts of the memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parques-curitiba.com/bosque-papa-joao-paulo.htm|title=Polish Memorial of Curitiba|publisher=Parques-curitiba.com|date=|accessdate=7 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715044611/http://www.parques-curitiba.com/bosque-papa-joao-paulo.htm|archive-date=15 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first group of Poles arrived in Curitiba around 1871. Curitiba has the biggest colony of Polish immigrants in Brazil.

[[Italian Brazilian|Italian immigrants]] started arriving in Brazil in 1875 and in Curitiba in 1878, coming mainly from the [[Veneto]] and [[Trento]] regions of [[Northern Italy]]. They settled mostly in the ''Santa Felicidade'' neighborhood, still a centre of the Italian community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba-parana.net/italianos.htm |title=Imigração e Cultura Italiana

Nearly 20,000 [[Ukrainians of Brazil|Ukrainian]] immigrants settled there between 1895 and 1897, consisting mostly of peasants from [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] who emigrated to Brazil to become farmers. Around 300,000 Ukrainian-Brazilians live in Paraná.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba-parana.net/parques/memorial-ucraniano.htm |title=Ukrainian memorial in the city of Curitiba |publisher=Curitiba-parana.net |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.pr.gov.br/e-parana/pg_etnias.php |title=Paraná Government (Ukrainian community in the State) |publisher=.pr.gov.br |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712140342/http://www3.pr.gov.br/e-parana/pg_etnias.php |archivedate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State of Paraná has the largest [[Ukrainians of Brazil|Ukrainian community]] and [[Slavic people|Slavic community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasil.kiev.ua/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=45&amp;layout=blog&amp;Itemid=30&amp;9856877558d17ec206d1a87e99fb1dce=3fab537243dff8dbaf45e8c8619a395b |title=Slavic community in Curitiba |publisher=Brasil.kiev.ua |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203110425/http://www.brasil.kiev.ua/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=45&amp;layout=blog&amp;Itemid=30&amp;9856877558d17ec206d1a87e99fb1dce=3fab537243dff8dbaf45e8c8619a395b |archivedate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Japanese-Brazilian|Japanese]] immigrants began arriving in 1915, with a larger contingent arriving in 1924. Curitiba received a significant Japanese influx. They settled mostly between Paraná and São Paulo state. The city has the second largest Japanese community in Brazil, behind only São Paulo, according to [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]. Although both cities have around the same proportion of Japanese descendants, other large cities in the countryside, such as Maringá and Londrina, have an even higher rate. Some estimates suggest that more than 40,000 Japanese-Brazilians live in Curitiba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba-parana.net/japao.htm |title=Japan Square in Curitiba |publisher=Curitiba-parana.net |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it was declared capital of the State of Paraná in 1853, the city has gone through several major urban planning projects to avoid uncontrolled growth and thus has become an international role model in dealing with issues including transportation and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/brazil2014/destination/cities/city=35400/index.html Curitiba Economy – FIFA report]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505083751/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/brazil2014/destination/cities/city%3D35400/index.html |date=5 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is Brazil's second largest car manufacturer. Its economy is based on industry, commerce and services. For that reason, Curitiba is considered by many investors to be the best location for investment in Brazil.

The city receives more than two million tourists every year. Most arrive via [[Afonso Pena International Airport]], where almost 60,000 flights land annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasilprimedesign.com/eng/lernoticia.asp?cod=56 |title=Curitiba – Economic ranks |publisher=Brasilprimedesign.com |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708091133/http://www.brasilprimedesign.com/eng/lernoticia.asp?cod=56 |archivedate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to IPEA data, the GDP in 2006 was 32&amp;nbsp;billion [[Brazilian real|reals]], without including agriculture and livestock (0.03%). Industry represented 34.13% and the commerce and service sectors 65.84%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipardes.gov.br/cadernos/Montapdf.php?Municipio=80000&amp;btOk=ok |title=GDP – Curitiba |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cidade Industrial de Curitiba, the industrial district, is home to many multinational industries, such as [[Nissan]], [[Renault]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]], [[Audi]], [[Volvo]], [[HSBC]], [[Siemens]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Electrolux]] and [[Kraft Foods]], as well as many well-known national industries, such as [[Sadia]], O Boticário and Positivo Informática.

Curitiba's infrastructure makes bus travel fast and convenient, effectively creating demand for bus use in the same way that the infrastructure of traditional cities creates demand for private motor vehicles. In July 2001, Curitiba became Brazil's first city to receive the prize "Pole of Information Technology", granted by ''InfoExame'' magazine. According to the magazine, the companies of "Technology and Information Technology" based in Curitiba in 2001 achieved {{USD|1.2&amp;nbsp;billion}} in revenues, representing a growth of 21% over the previous year.&lt;ref name="RTI"&gt;{{cite web |title=A capital do Paraná se destaca na área de TI e oferece oportunidades para profissionais do setor.|publisher=Revista TI|language=Portuguese|accessdate=11 October 2003 |url=http://www.timaster.com.br/revista/materias%5Cmain_materia.asp?codigo=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's 30-year economic growth rate is 7.1%, higher than the national average of 4.2%, and per capita income is 66% higher than the Brazilian average. Between 1975 and 1995, Curitiba's domestic product grew by some 75% more than the entire State of Paraná, and 48% more than Brazil as a whole. In 1994, tourism generated {{USD|280&amp;nbsp;million}}, 4% of the city's net income. Curitiba has municipal health, education and day care networks, neighborhood libraries shared by schools and citizens and Citizenship Streets, where buildings provide essential public services, sports and cultural facilities near transportation terminals. At the Open University, residents can take courses in subjects such as mechanics, hair styling and environmental protection for a small fee. Policies for job creation and income generation became part of the city's [[strategic planning]] in the 1990s, for the metropolitan area as well as the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hopebuilding.pbworks.com/Brazilian-city-of-Curitiba-may-be-most-livable-city-in-the-world |title=Economy – City of Curitiba |publisher=Hopebuilding.pbworks.com |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1990, the Municipal Housing Fund has provided financial support to housing for lower income populations. After national housing finance collapsed in 1985, just as people from the countryside poured into Curitiba, the city's [[public housing]] program bought one of the few remaining large plots of land, "Novo Bairro" (New Neighborhood), as home for 50,000 families. While landowners built the houses themselves, each received a pair of trees and an hour's consultation with an architect to help them develop their plan. COHAB also built Technology Street, an avenue of 24 homes in the centre of Novo Bairro, each built using different construction techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hopebuilding.pbworks.com/Brazilian-city-of-Curitiba-may-be-most-livable-city-in-the-world |title=Housing Program Curitiba |publisher=Hopebuilding.pbworks.com |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven massive shopping malls are found in Curitiba shopping: Mueller, Estação, Curitiba, Crystal, Palladium, Patio Batel and Park Barigüi. The [[Rua das Flores]] (Street of Flowers) is home to the majority of stores. The area is pedestrianized, with no cars around the centre. An essential element of Curitiba shopping is the Feira do Largo da Ordem, or Largo da Ordem Street Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba.info/curitiba-shopping.html |title=Shopping in Curitiba, Brazil |publisher=Curitiba.info |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational system===
In the 1990s, the city started a project called ''Faróis do Saber'' ("Lighthouses of Knowledge"). These [[lighthouse]]s are free educational centres that include [[library|libraries]], Internet access and other cultural resources. Libraries work with municipal schools, offering a collection of approximately 5000 books, and provide cultural reference and leisure.&lt;ref name="ecofanit"&gt;{{cite web|title=CURITIBA, UNA CITTÀ DA FANTASCIENZA |publisher=Eco Fantascienza |language=Italian |accessdate=18 October 2008 |url=http://www.ecofantascienza.it/articoli/curitiba.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501143512/http://www.ecofantascienza.it/articoli/curitiba.html |archivedate=1 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban planning==
[[File:Rua 24 horas 2 Curitiba Basil.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Entrance of [[Rua 24 Horas|24 Hours Street]].]]
Curitiba has a planned transportation system, which includes lanes on major streets devoted to a [[bus rapid transit]] system. The buses are split into three sections ([[Bi-articulated bus|bi-articulated]]) and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with access for disabled riders. Buses charge one price regardless of distance.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Rabinovitch and Josef Leitman, "Urban Planning in Curitiba", ''Scientific American'', vol. 274, no. 3 (March 1996), pp. 46–53&lt;/ref&gt;

The city preserves and cares for its green areas, boasting {{convert|51.5|m2|sqft}} of green space per inhabitant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/ciencia/interna/0,,OI1926962-EI299,00.html|title=Curitiba busca recuperação de biodiversidade local Terra – Ambiente |publisher=Noticias.terra.com.br |date= |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s and 1950s, [[Alfred Agache (architect)|Alfred Agache]], cofounder of the [[French Society for Urban Studies]], was hired to produce the first city plan. It emphasised a star of boulevards, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. The plan was too expensive to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/Paginas/ENG/Default.aspx?idf=532&amp;servico=40 |title=Prefeitura ENG |publisher=Curitiba.pr.gov.br |date= |accessdate=22 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, Curitiba's population had reached 430,000. Some residents feared that the growth in population threatened to damage the character of the city. In 1964, Mayor Ivo Arzua solicited proposals for urban design. Architect [[Jaime Lerner]], who later became mayor, led a team from the [[Universidade Federal do Paraná]] that suggested strict controls on urban sprawl, reduced traffic in the downtown area, preservation of Curitiba's Historic Sector and a convenient and affordable public transit system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcachicago.org/massivechange/timelines/urban.pdf About Curitiba] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125170008/http://mcachicago.org/massivechange/timelines/urban.pdf |date=25 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This plan, known as the Curitiba Master Plan, was adopted in 1968. Lerner closed [[Rua XV de Novembro|XV de Novembro St.]] to vehicles, because it had high pedestrian traffic. The plan had a new road design to minimise traffic: the Trinary Road System. This used two one-way streets moving in opposite directions that surround a smaller, two-lane street where the express buses have an exclusive lane. Five of these roads form a star that converges on the city centre. Land farther from these roads is zoned for lower density development, to pull traffic away from the main roads. In a number of areas subject to floods, buildings were condemned and the land became parks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pescacommosca.com.br/noticia/lernoticia.php?IdtNoticia=869 Parks of Curitiba and floods]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012061522/http://www.pescacommosca.com.br/noticia/lernoticia.php?IdtNoticia=869 |date=12 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Curitiba is considered one of the world's best examples of urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;Irazábal, Clara Elena (2002) ''Curitiba and Portland: Architecture, City Making, and Urban Governance in the Era of Globalization'', PhD Dissertation in Architecture, University of California, Berkeley, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1996, the chairman of the [[Habitat II]] summit of mayors and urban planners in [[Istanbul]] praised Curitiba as "the most innovative city in the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0104-44782001000100007&amp;script=sci_arttext |title=Curitiba – urban plannig |doi=10.1590/S0104-44782001000100007 |publisher=Scielo.br |date=31 March 1993 |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rua xv curitiba.jpg|thumb|right|180px|15 November Street.]]
Curitiba was recently recommended by [[UNESCO]] as a model for the reconstruction of the cities of [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="afghjp"&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ja:クリチバもモデルに＝カブール復興計画に参加 |publisher=Nikkey Shimbun|language=Japanese |accessdate=21 October 2008 |url=http://www.nikkeyshimbun.com.br/020615-24brasil.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041103064150/http://www.nikkeyshimbun.com.br/020615-24brasil.html |archivedate=3 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, the RIT ([[Rede Integrada de Transporte]], ''Integrated Transport Network'') was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbs.curitiba.pr.gov.br/PORTAL/historiadotransportecoletivo.php |title=RIT Curitiba – Trajetory |publisher=Urbs.curitiba.pr.gov.br |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the city began building the "Faróis de Saber" (''Lighthouses of Knowledge'') educational centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmc.pr.gov.br/ass_det.php?not=7004 |title=Social programs in the city |publisher=Cmc.pr.gov.br |date=16 May 2006 |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has more than {{convert|400|km2|0|abbr=out}} of public parks and forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenplanetmonitor.net/news/2012/12/curitiba-sustainable-city/|title=Curitiba - Sustainable City|last=Anil Mundra|date=27 December 2012|publisher=Green Planet Monitor|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the city placed third in a list of "15 Green Cities" in the world, according to "[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]]" magazine, after [[Reykjavík]] in Iceland and [[Portland, Oregon]] in the United States. As a result, according to one survey, 99% of Curitibans are happy with their hometown.&lt;ref name="grist"&gt;{{cite web |title=15 Green Cities|publisher=Grist|accessdate=10 July 2007 |url=http://www.grist.org/article/cities3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaime Lerner suggests [[Urban Acupuncture|urban acupuncture]] as the future solution for contemporary urban issues; focusing on very narrow pressure points in cities, can create positive ripple effects. Urban "acupuncture" reclaims land for the public and emphasizes the importance of community development through small interventions in design of cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.davidson.edu/anthro16/space/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] - '' Understanding Space'' 2011  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425152838/http://forum.davidson.edu/anthro16/space/urban-acupuncture/ |date=25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasises pinpoint interventions that can be accomplished quickly to create a make an immediate impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brazilmax.com/news.cfm/tborigem/pl_south/id/10 Curitiba: Jaime Lerner’s Urban Acupuncture] - ''Bill Hinchberger, Brazilmax'' 2/2006  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204151632/http://www.brazilmax.com/news.cfm/tborigem/pl_south/id/10 |date=4 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "capacity building job line" was created to accelerate economic development. Key initiatives include the South-Circular bus line, which links the southern and eastern regions of town; Entrepreneurial "Sheds", business incubators designed to help small companies get established and prosper; and the Crafts Lycée, which trains people for [[profession]]s such as marketing and finance. Specifically, the goal is to provide jobs and income for the unemployed among 400,000 people living in 15 peripheral towns, and to structure and develop the region according to integrated planning principles. About 15,000 new jobs were generated by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.iclei.org/localstrategies/summary/curitiba2.html|title=Curitiba a green city|website=3.iclei.org|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jonas Rabinovitch, a United Nations senior adviser and former planner at the ''Curitiba Research and Urban Planning Institute'' (IPPUC), up to 8% of Curitiba's population still lived in [[favelas]] as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adler|first1=David|title=Story of cities #37: how radical ideas turned Curitiba into Brazil's 'green capital'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/06/story-of-cities-37-mayor-jaime-lerner-curitiba-brazil-green-capital-global-icon|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 August 2017|date=6 May 2016|quote=Up to 8% of Curitiba still lives in favelas; it is not a socio-economic island within the Brazilian context.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2010 census data collected by [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]], 49.7 thousand homes in Curitiba form part of irregular settlements.&lt;ref name="Gira pelos Bairros"&gt;{{cite web|title=9,3% dos curitibanos moram em favelas - Giro pelos Bairros|url=http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/blogs/giro-pelos-bairros/93-dos-curitibanos-moram-em-favelas/|website=Giro pelos Bairros|publisher=Gazeta do Povo|accessdate=2 August 2017|language=pt-BR|date=6 September 2012|quote=Em Curitiba, há 49,7 mil domicílios nesta situação.

The transit service is used by more than 2&amp;nbsp;million people a day. Curitiba has more car owners per capita than anywhere else in Brazil. The population has doubled since 1974, yet auto traffic declined by 30%, and [[atmospheric pollution]] is the lowest in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.iclei.org/localstrategies/summary/curitiba2.html|title=Curitiba – low pollution|website=3.iclei.org|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Curitiba - Feira do Largo da Ordem - Grupo de Chorinho.JPG|thumb|left|Musicians in [[Feirinha do largo da ordem]].]]
In January 1973 the Fundação Cultural de Curitiba was set up, with the aim of promoting culture.&lt;ref name="pr2"/&gt;

[[File:Opera de Arame Interior.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wire Opera House]].]]

The Cultural Complex Solar do Barão features the Photography Museum, the Engravings Museum and the Posters Museu. The MuMA - Museu Metropolitano de Arte (Museum of Metropolitan Art) displays artists from the state of Paraná as well as renowned Brazilian [[painter]]s such as Pancetti, Guignard and [[Di Cavalcanti]]&lt;ref name="pr2"/&gt;

The Polish Immigrants Memorial, also known as The Pope's Woods, offers an enjoyable area surrounded by trees, which makes it a perfect choice for a stroll. The Pope himself blessed the first [[replica]] of the traditional Polish houses that beautifully make up the Bosque do Papa when he visited the city in 1980.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In 2003, Curitiba received the "[[American Capital of Culture]]" title, granted by the OAS ([[Organization of American States]]).&lt;ref name="pr2"/&gt;

===Arts and entertainment===
Curitiba was Brazil's first city to have an [[IMAX]] movie theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shoppingpalladium.com.br/ |title=Palladium Shopping Center |publisher=Shoppingpalladium.com.br |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curitiba has many theaters.

===Museums===
Brazilian architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]] designed the extravagant state museum of Curitiba. Its design includes a gravity-defying construction that was intended to look like a [[Araucaria angustifolia|Paraná Pine]], one of the city's symbols, but is widely interpreted by locals as an eye, which gave the Museum its nickname – ''Museu do Olho'', or Museum of the Eye. In keeping with Curitiba's history and culture of science, the museum offers many science exhibitions, including biennial exhibitions. The Curitiba museum includes the Oscar Niemeyer auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba.info/curitiba-history.html |title=Museums in the city |publisher=Curitiba.info |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public transport===
{{Main|Rede Integrada de Transporte}}
Curitiba's public transportation consists entirely of buses. It opened the world's first [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) system, [[Rede Integrada de Transporte]], in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneider|first=Keith|title=Putting BRT in Car City, China|url=http://americancity.org/daily/entry/putting-brt-in-car-city-china|newspaper=Next American City|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of Curitiba's BRT has effected a [[modal shift]] from automobile travel to bus travel. Based on 1991 traveler survey results, it was estimated that the introduction of the BRT had caused a reduction of about 27&amp;nbsp;million auto trips per year, annually saving about 27&amp;nbsp;million liters of fuel. In particular, 28 percent of BRT riders previously traveled by car. Compared to eight other Brazilian cities of its size, Curitiba uses about 30 percent less fuel per capita, resulting in one of the country's lowest rates of ambient air pollution. Some 1,100 buses make 12,500 trips every day, serving more than 1.3&amp;nbsp;million passengers, 50 times the number from 20 years ago. Eighty percent of travelers use the express or direct bus services.

==Neighborhoods==
[[File:Divisao administrativa Curitiba.svg|thumb|180px|Map of Curitiba, with the neighborhoods and boroughs.]]
:''See also: {{illm|List of bairros of Curitiba|pt|Lista de bairros de Curitiba}}''
''Bairros'' (neighborhoods) of Curitiba define the city's geographical divisions. Administrative powers are not delegated to neighborhoods, although neighborhood associations work to improve their communities.
Curitiba is divided into 9 regional governments (boroughs) covering the 75 neighborhoods.

Most districts of Curitiba were born of colonial groups formed by families of European immigrants in the second half of the nineteenth century.

The centro (downtown or central business district), was where the city was founded, is the most bustling area, which concentrates most of the financial institutions of Curitiba.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The primary objective of the Department is to foster awareness, understanding and skill in the scholarly applications of computing. It operates in three main areas: as a department with responsibility for its own academic programme; as a research centre promoting the appropriate application of computing in humanities research; and as a unit providing collegial support to its sister departments in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities. 

The Centre for Computing in the Humanities was established by Professor Harold Short in 1991, and changed its name in 2011. Professor Tobias Blanke, is currently Head of Department.

'''Far East prisoners of war''' is a term used in the [[United Kingdom]] to describe former [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[prisoners of war]] held in the [[Far East]] during the [[Second World War]]. The term is also used as the [[initialism]] '''FEPOW''' (spelled out when said, not pronounced as a word), or as the [[abbreviation]] '''Far East POWs'''.

Its adoption by various independent voluntary organisations providing support to this specific community of former POWs is an implicit{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} indictment of the perceived lack of UK government support for this community, criticism partly deflected by a UK government compensation scheme introduced in 2000.
[[Image:Portrait of "Dusty" Rhodes by Ashley George Old.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Portrait of FEPOW "Dusty" Rhodes. A three-minute sketch by [[Ashley George Old]]  painted in Thailand in 1944.]]

== Compensation scheme ==

Since 2000, following a campaign led by the [[Royal British Legion]], former Far East POWs are eligible for UK Government compensation for their suffering in POW and internment camps operated by the Japanese during the War.

Compensation may be payable to any member of all British Groups imprisoned by the Japanese in the Second World War.  It is therefore available to British civilians and [[British Merchant Navy|merchant seamen]] as well as members of British and Commonwealth forces.  An amendment of the scheme in 2002 extended compensation to former [[Gurkha|Gurkha soldiers]].

An application may be made by either a former POW or their family or [[Estate (law)|estate]].  A successful FEPOW applicant is entitled to an ''[[ex gratia]]'' payment of £10,000. The scheme is currently administered by the [[Veterans Agency]].

== Clubs and organisations ==
[[File:The Far East Prisoners of War Memorial Building, National Memorial Arboretum - geograph.org.uk - 821086.jpg|thumb|left|The Far East Prisoners of War Memorial Building, [[National Memorial Arboretum]]]]
The National Federation of Far East Prisoner of War Clubs and Associations (NFFCA) acts as an umbrella organisation for over 60 autonomous FEPOW Clubs and Associations in the UK.

The [http://www.fepow-community.org.uk FEPOW Community] has been set up to research loved ones who suffered under Japanese captivity during World War II. It does incorporate a free group, with its members helping each other in research. The Roll-of-Honour ([http://www.roll-of-honour.org.uk Roll of Honour]) has every death of service personnel and civilians mentioned in the site, most having a page of their own. The Far Eastern Heroes ([http://www.far-eastern-heroes.org.uk Far Eastern Heroes]) covers stories from the FEPOWs themselves, with a special page which promotes [http://www.fepow-day.org FEPOW Day] as 15 August, the day Japan surrendered.

Children and Families of the Far East Prisoners of War (COFEPOW) was founded in 1997 by Carol Cooper in [[Norfolk]] after a chance reading of a newspaper article about the discovery of a diary of a soldier who had died working on the [[Burma Railway]].  It emerged that the soldier was her father.  In 1999 it became a registered charity.  Today it comprises a membership of children and siblings of those who died as POWs and campaigns to raise awareness, raises funds for the creation of memorials both in the UK and the Far East, and offers resources for research.

In 2005, it established the Far East Prisoners of War Memorial Building at the [[National Memorial Arboretum]] in [[Staffordshire]], England. Within the building an exhibition tells the story of those captured by the Japanese during the Second World War. In the same area of the Arboretum are memorials for those prisoners of war who suffered and died building the Burma and [[Sumatra Railway]]s.

== FEPOW War Artists ==

Life in the POW camps was recorded at great risk to themselves by artists such as [[Jack Bridger Chalker]], [[Philip Meninsky]], [[Ashley George Old]] and [[Ronald Searle]]. Human hair was often used for brushes, plant juices and blood for paint, and toilet paper as the "canvas". Some of their works were used as evidence in the trials of Japanese war criminals.

The [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]] undertook a study of British Far East POW medical art subsequent to a FEPOW oral history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.captivememories.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

== FEPOW Memorial Church ==
[[File:Wymondham Catholic Church and FEPOW memorial - geograph.org.uk - 1290555.jpg|thumb|Wymondham Catholic Church and FEPOW memorial]]
Our Lady &amp; St Thomas of Canterbury in [[Wymondham]], [[Norfolk]], England was completed in 1952 on the initiative of Father Malcolm Cowin - former Roman Catholic [[Chaplain]] to the [[2nd Cambridgeshire Regiment]] and who himself had spent 3½ years in Japanese POW camps. The site and a fund to build the church had been provided by Irish labours and [[USAAF]] personnel in the area. While a prisoner he helped construct three chapels in different camps and determined that on his return to the UK he would build a church in memory of those who died in Japanese POW and internment camps.

It serves as a parish church for the local Roman Catholic community as well as a focal point for the wider FEPOW community.  There is a FEPOW shrine and an annual FEPOW memorial service held on the nearest Sunday to 14 May the anniversary of the relief of Rangoon.

'''''Film Quarterly''''', a journal devoted to the study of film, television, and visual media, is published by [[University of California Press]]. It publishes scholarly analyses of international and Hollywood cinema as well as independent film, including documentary and animation. The journal also revisits film classics; examines television and digital and online media; reports from international film festivals; reviews recent academic publications; and on occasion addresses installations, video games and emergent technologies.  It welcomes established scholars as well as emergent voices that bring new perspectives to bear on visual representation as rooted in issues of diversity, race, lived experience, gender, sexuality, and transnational histories. ''Film Quarterly'' brings timely critical and intersectional approaches to criticism and analyses of visual culture. 

Since 2013, it has been edited by [[B. Ruby Rich]], with Regina Longo as associate editor. In 2015, ''Film Quarterly'' began to receive funding from the [[Ford Foundation|Ford Foundation’s]] JustFilms initiative to “support the journal’s work in advancing criticism, analysis, and reporting with particular attention to social justice documentary and the interrogation of cinema practices across genres and platforms.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content.ucpress.edu/pr/FQ_Ford_Press_Release_Sept.pdf|title=UC Press Release. September 30, 2015.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
''Film Quarterly'' was first published in 1945 as ''Hollywood Quarterly'', was renamed ''The Quarterly of Film, Radio, and Television'' in 1951, and has operated under its current title since 1958.

=== ''Hollywood Quarterly'' (1945–1951) ===
According to former ''Film Quarterly'' editorial board member Brian Henderson, “''Hollywood Quarterly'' was launched in 1945 as a joint venture of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization and the University of California Press. The association began as a wartime collaboration between educators and media workers in response to social needs occasioned by the war.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft5h4nb36j;brand=ucpress|title=Film Quarterly: Forty Years, a Selection.|last=Henderson, Brian, Ann Martin, and Lee Amazonas|first=|publisher=University of California Press.|year=1999|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable members of its first editorial board were playwright and screenwriter John Howard Lawson, psychologist Franklin Fearing, and writer-director Abraham Polonsky.

=== ''Quarterly of Film, Radio, and Television'' (1951–1958) ===
After allegations in a [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House of Un-American Activities]] Committee hearing that ''Hollywood Quarterly'' had communist leanings, in 1951, the journal changed its name to ''Quarterly of Film, Radio, and Television''. This name change inaugurated the journal’s clear divorce from the Hollywood industry with which it had partnered for several years. The journal’s turn towards “politically safe” work in the following years led to editorial discord and instability until August Frugé, then-director of UC Press, changed the direction of the journal. Frugé drew inspiration from the European film journals ''[[Sight &amp; Sound|Sight and Sound]]'' and ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'', noting in his book that, "there was no American review comparable to these two, intellectual but not academic and devoted to film as art and not as communication. By accident we found ourselves with the means to publish one—if we chose and if we knew how."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520084261|title=A Skeptic Among Scholars: August Frugé on University Publishing.|last=Frugé|first=August|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Film Quarterly'' (1958- ) ===
Under the editorial guidance and visionary leadership of [[Ernest Callenbach]], the journal rebranded itself to bridge film criticism and scholarship, and was renamed ''Film Quarterly'' in Fall 1958. Its initial advisory board was composed of, among others, film scholar Andries Deinum; [[Gavin Lambert]], a former editor of ''Sight and Sound'' who was then a screenwriter in Hollywood; Albert Johnson, a Bay Area-based film programmer and critic; and [[Colin Young (film educator)|Colin Young]], who taught film at UCLA and later became the first director of the British [[National Film and Television School]]. Ernest Callenbach remained ''Film Quarterly''’s editor until the Fall 1991 issue; he had overseen the production of 133 issues by the end of his appointment.

Ann Martin, who had worked as an editor at ''American Film'' and ''The New Yorker'', and on various film and video productions, served as the editor of ''Film Quarterly'' during 1991–2006. Rob White, who had edited the British Film Institute’s BFI Classics series, was in charge during 2006–2012. [[David Sterritt]] took over as guest editor for volume 66 in 2012–13.

Immediately following its 40th anniversary, the University of California Press published a ''Film Quarterly'' anthology of its groundbreaking essays, co-edited by Brian Henderson and then-editor Ann Martin. Editorial board members Leo Baudry, [[Ernest Callenbach]], Albert Johnson, [[Marsha Kinder]], and [[Linda Williams (film scholar)|Linda Williams]] all participated in the conceptualization of the volume. In 2002, Ann Martin and Eric Smoodin (who was then the Film, Media, and Philosophy Acquisitions Editor at UC Press) co-edited a volume of highlights from the journal’s ''Hollywood Quarterly (''1945–1951) years.

In 2013, film critic and historian B. Ruby Rich took over as editor for the journal. Rich's editorial vision has particularly emphasized work that engages with fresh approaches to film in a shifting digital media environment and a broadened view of cultural and critical approaches for both historical and contemporary work. ''Film Quarterly'' has emphasized the shifting forms and meanings the moving image has taken in the digital age and worked to expand its views of the field and the writers included in its pages. Special dossiers have focused on [[Joshua Oppenheimer]]’s ground-breaking ''[[The Act of Killing]]'', the cinema of [[Richard Linklater]], the significance of Brazilian documentarian [[Eduardo Coutinho|Edouardo Coutinho]], and the legacy of [[Chantal Akerman]]. Cover stories have focused on such films as [[Melvin Van Peebles|Melvin Van Peebles']] [[Watermelon Man (film)|''The Watermelon Man'']], [[Louis Massiah|Louis Massiah's]] ''[http://fq.ucpress.edu/content/68/4/8 The Bombing of Osage Avenue]'' and [[Jill Soloway]]'s ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]].'' ''Film Quarterly'' aims to widens the scope of voices published in its pages, creates a shared discourse for divergent platforms, and broadens the canon beyond traditional auteurism. 

== Pauline Kael’s Involvement ==
For a brief time in the 1950s, Pauline Kael was considered for the role of editor. She was then a programmer at the Cinema Guild, a repertory movie house in Berkeley, CA. Frugé and Kael did not share the same vision so the position was subsequently offered to Callenbach instead. Beginning in 1961, a regular feature, "Films of the Quarter," appeared in which a group of well-known film critics—[[Dwight Macdonald]], [[Stanley Kauffmann]], [[Pauline Kael]], [[Jonas Mekas]], and [[Gavin Lambert]]—discussed what they viewed as the best films of the prior three months. In the Spring 1963 issue, Pauline Kael famously attacked [[Andrew Sarris]]’ [[auteur theory]] in her landmark article, "Circles and Squares." In the Summer 1963 issue, Sarris responded to Kael’s critique with his own article, "The Auteur Theory and the Perils of Pauline."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kael included many of her articles, film reviews, and other material published in ''FQ'' during 1961–65 in her first book, ''[[I Lost It at the Movies]]'' (1965).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11581">The '''Fontana Modern Masters''' was a series of pocket guides on writers, [[philosophy|philosophers]], and other thinkers and theorists who shaped the intellectual landscape of the twentieth century. The first five titles were published on 12 January 1970 by Fontana Books, the paperback imprint of [[William Collins (publisher)|William Collins &amp; Co]], and the series editor was [[Frank Kermode]] who was Professor of Modern [[English literature|English Literature]] at [[University College London]]. The books were very popular with students, who 'bought them by the handful' according to Kermode,&lt;ref&gt;Frank Kermode. ''Not Entitled: A Memoir''. London: [[HarperCollins]], 1996, p.224.&lt;/ref&gt; and they were instantly recognisable by their eye-catching covers, which featured brightly coloured abstract art and [[sans-serif]] [[typography]].

== Art as book covers ==

The Fontana Modern Masters occupy a unique place in publishing history - not for their contents but their covers, which draw on the following developments in twentieth-century art and literature:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wire-frame.net/news.html#00007 James Pardey. 'The Shape of the Century'.] ''[[Eye (magazine)|Eye Magazine]]'', Winter 2009, pp.6-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/rwabristol/docs/rwa_art_autumn_2012_www/28?mode=window&amp;backgroundColor=%23222222 James Pardey. 'Oliver Bevan: In Search of Utopia'.] ''[[Royal West of England Academy|RWA Magazine]]'', Autumn 2012, pp.26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Twentieth-century [[geometric abstraction]], [[Color Field|colour-field painting]] and [[hard-edge painting]].
* [[Op art|Op Art]], and in particular the work of [[Victor Vasarely]].
* The English [[beatnik]] [[Brion Gysin|Brion Gysin's]] [[cut-up technique]] as popularized by [[William S. Burroughs|William Burroughs]].

The cover concept was the brainchild of Fontana's art director John Constable, who had been experimenting with a cover treatment based on cut-ups of ''[[The Mud Bath]]'', a key work of British geometric abstraction by the painter [[David Bomberg]]. However, a visit to the Grabowski Gallery in London introduced Constable to the work of [[Oliver Bevan]], a graduate of the [[Royal College of Art]] in 1964, whose optical and geometric paintings were influenced by Vasarely's Op Art. On seeing Bevan's work, Constable commissioned him to create the covers for the first ten Fontana Modern Masters, which Bevan painted as rectilinear arrangements of tesselating blocks. Each cover was thus a piece of abstract art, but as an incentive for readers to buy all ten books the covers could be arranged to create a larger, composite artwork. The 'set of ten' books appeared in 1970-71 but overran when ''Joyce'' was published with the same cover as ''Guevara'':

* ''[[Albert Camus|Camus]]'' by [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]], 1970
* ''[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]]'' by [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]], 1970
* ''[[Frantz Fanon|Fanon]]'' by [[David Caute]], 1970
* ''[[Che Guevara|Guevara]]'' by [[Andrew Sinclair]], 1970
* ''[[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]'' by [[Edmund Leach]], 1970
* ''[[György Lukács|Lukács]]'' by [[George Lichtheim]], 1970
* ''[[Herbert Marcuse|Marcuse]]'' by [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], 1970
* ''[[Marshall McLuhan|McLuhan]]'' by [[Jonathan Miller]], 1971
* ''[[George Orwell|Orwell]]'' by [[Raymond Williams]], 1971
* ''[[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'' by [[David Pears]], 1971
* ''[[James Joyce|Joyce]]'' by [[John Gross]], 1971

A second 'set of ten' featuring a new Bevan cut-up was published in 1971-73 but the inclusion of ''Joyce'' in the first 'set of ten' left this second set one book short:
* ''[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'' by [[Richard Wollheim]], 1971
* ''[[Wilhelm Reich|Reich]]'' by [[Charles Rycroft]], 1971
* ''[[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]]'' by [[Denis Donoghue (academic)|Denis Donoghue]], 1971
* ''[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]]'' by [[George Woodcock]], 1972
* ''[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'' by [[Robert Conquest]], 1972
* ''[[Norman Mailer|Mailer]]'' by [[Richard Poirier]], 1972
* ''[[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'' by [[Alfred Jules Ayer|A J Ayer]], 1972
* ''[[Carl Jung|Jung]]'' by [[Anthony Storr]], 1973
* ''[[D. H. Lawrence|Lawrence]]'' by Frank Kermode, 1973

A third 'set of ten' featuring Bevan's kinetic ''Pyramid'' painting began to appear in 1973-74 but Constable left before the set was complete and his replacement, [[Mike Dempsey]], scrapped the set-of-ten incentive after eight books:
* ''[[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]'' by [[Al Alvarez|A Alvarez]], 1973
* ''[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'' by [[Jeremy Bernstein]], 1973
* ''[[R. D. Laing|Laing]]'' by [[Edgar Z. Friedenberg]], 1973
* ''[[Karl Popper|Popper]]'' by [[Bryan Magee]], 1973
* ''[[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]'' by [[Erich Heller]], 1974
* ''[[Le Corbusier]]'' by [[Stephen Gardiner (architect)|Stephen Gardiner]], 1974
* ''[[Marcel Proust|Proust]]'' by [[Roger Shattuck]], 1974
* ''[[Max Weber|Weber]]'' by Donald G MacRae, 1974

Dempsey switched the covers to a white background and commissioned a new artist James Lowe, whose cover art for the next eight books in 1975-76 was based on triangles: 
* ''[[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]]'' by [[Stephen Spender]], 1975
* ''[[Karl Marx|Marx]]'' by [[David McLellan (academic)|David McLellan]], 1975
* ''[[Ezra Pound|Pound]]'' by [[Donald Davie]], 1975
* ''[[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]]'' by [[Arthur Danto|Arthur C Danto]], 1975
* ''[[Antonin Artaud|Artaud]]'' by [[Martin Esslin]], 1976
* ''[[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]]'' by D E Moggridge, 1976
* ''[[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]'' by [[Jonathan Culler]], 1976
* ''[[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'' by [[Charles Rosen]], 1976

Nine more books appeared in 1977-79 with cover art by James Lowe based on squares:
* ''[[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]'' by David McLellan, 1977
* ''[[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]]'' by [[James Joll]], 1977
* ''[[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]]'' by [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]], 1978
* ''[[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'' by [[George Steiner]], 1978
* ''[[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'' by [[J. P. Stern|J P Stern]], 1978
* ''[[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]'' by [[Irving Howe]], 1978
* ''[[Melanie Klein|Klein]]'' by [[Hanna Segal]], 1979
* ''[[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'' by [[Jeffrey Alan Gray|Jeffrey A Gray]], 1979
* ''[[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'' by [[Margaret Boden|Margaret A Boden]], 1979

Dempsey left Fontana Books in 1979 but continued to oversee the Modern Masters series until a new art director, Patrick Mortimer, was appointed in 1980. Four more books followed under Mortimer with cover art by James Lowe based on circles:
* ''[[E. E. Evans-Pritchard|Evans-Pritchard]]'' by [[Mary Douglas]], 1980
* ''[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'' by Wilma George, 1982
* ''[[Roland Barthes|Barthes]]'' by [[Jonathan Culler]], 1983
* ''[[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]]'' by [[Martin Jay]], 1984

The cover concept was dropped after this and a new design was used that featured a portrait of the Modern Master as a line drawing or later a tinted photograph, and mixed serif and sans-serif typefaces, upright and italic fonts, block capitals, lowercase letters and faux handwriting. The design was used for reprints and six new titles: 
* ''[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'' by [[José Guilherme Merquior|J G Merquior]], 1985
* ''[[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]'' by [[Christopher Norris (critic)|Christopher Norris]], 1987
* ''[[Donald Winnicott|Winnicott]]'' by [[Adam Phillips (psychologist)|Adam Phillips]], 1988
* ''[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]'' by [[Malcolm Bowie]], 1991
* ''[[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]]'' by David Watson, 1992
* ''[[Isaiah Berlin|Berlin]]'' by [[John N. Gray|John Gray]], 1995

== Book covers as art ==
Fontana's use of art as book covers went full circle in 2003-05 when the British [[conceptual art]]ist [[Jamie Shovlin]] 'reproduced' the covers of the forty-eight Fontana Modern Masters from ''Camus'' to ''Barthes'' as a series of flawed paintings (the titles are missing and the colours have run) in watercolour and ink on paper, each measuring 28 x 19&amp;nbsp;cm. However, Shovlin also noticed ten forthcoming titles listed on the books' front endpapers which, for reasons unknown, had not been published:

* ''[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]]'' by [[Harold Rosenberg]]
* ''[[Buckminster Fuller|Fuller]]'' by [[Allan Temko]]
* ''[[Roman Jakobson|Jakobson]]'' by [[Thomas Sebeok|Thomas A Sebeok]]
* ''[[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'' by [[Lionel Trilling]]
* ''[[Thomas Mann|Mann]]'' by Lionel Trilling
* ''[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty|Merleau-Ponty]]'' by H P Dreyfus
* ''[[Joseph Needham|Needham]]'' by George Steiner
* ''[[Charles Scott Sherrington|Sherrington]]'' by Jonathan Miller
* ''[[Saul Steinberg|Steinberg]]'' by [[John Hollander]]
* ''Winnicott'' by [[Masud Khan]] (this was published with a different author, as listed in the previous section)

Shovlin then set out to paint these 'lost' titles and thus 'complete' the series. To do this he devised a 'Fontana Colour Chart' based on the covers of the published books, and a scoring system that - like his paintings - was deliberately flawed. Given these flaws, and those in Fontana's original series, the absence of any modern masters from the visual arts is notable,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fontanamodernmasters.org/07.html#Riflemaker Jamie Shovlin. ''Fontana Modern Masters''.] Riflemaker, London, 14 April - 28 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; since ''Matisse'' was one of four 'forthcoming titles' which Shovlin had apparently overlooked:

* ''[[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]'' by [[Samuel Weber]]
* ''[[Erik Erikson|Erikson]]'' by [[Robert Jay Lifton|Robert Lifton]]
* ''[[Ho Chi Minh|Ho]]'' by [[David Halberstam]]
* ''[[Henri Matisse|Matisse]]'' by [[David Sylvester]]

''Benjamin'' and ''Matisse'' have since been included in a new series of seventeen large Fontana Modern Masters that Shovlin painted in 2011-12. These use a similar scoring system to his watercolours of 2003-05 and a new 'Acrylic Variations Colour Wheel'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fontanamodernmasters.org/07.html#HoV Jamie Shovlin. ''Various Arrangements''.] [[Haunch of Venison]], London, 18 April - 26 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings are acrylic on canvas and each measures 210 x 130&amp;nbsp;cm:

* ''Arendt by David Watson (Variation 1)''
* ''Benjamin by Samuel Weber (Variation 3)''
* ''Berlin by John Gray (Variation 1)''
* ''Derrida by Christopher Norris (Variation 3)''
* ''Dostoyevsky by Harold Rosenberg (Variation 1)''

==Y-DNA==
===2005 studies===
''The haplogroup nomenclature follows the [[Y Chromosome Consortium|YCC]] 2008 system. See [[Conversion table for Y chromosome haplogroups]] for comparison with the nomenclature used in pre-2008 sources.'' &lt;!-- The haplogroups' names are according to the nomenclature adopted in 2008, as represented in {{harvnb|Battaglia et al.|2008|loc=[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2947100/figure/fig2/ fig. 2]}}, so they may differ from the corresponding names in {{harvnb|Peričić et al.|2005}}. --&gt;

[[Y chromosome|Y-chromosom]]al [[haplogroup]]s identified among the Serbs from Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina are the following:
*[[Haplogroup I2 (Y-DNA)|I2a]]-P37.2, with frequencies of 29.20% and 30.90%, respectively. The frequency of this haplogroup peaks in [[Herzegovina]] (64%), while its variance peaks over a large geographic area covering Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia. It is the second most predominant Y-chromosomal haplogroup in the overall Slavic gene pool.&lt;ref name=pericic&gt;{{harvnb|Peričić et al.|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marjanovic/&gt;
*[[Haplogroup E1b1b1a (Y-DNA)|E1b1b1a2]]-V13, 20.4% and 19.80%. In [[Southeast Europe]], the frequency of this haplogroup peaks at the region's southeastern edge and its variance peaks in the southwest of the region. Its high frequency among [[Kosovo Albanians]] (46%) is most likely a consequence of [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref name=pericic/&gt;&lt;ref name=marjanovic/&gt;
*[[R1a1]]-M17, 15.93% and 13.60%. The frequency of this haplogroup peaks in Ukraine (54.0%), and  is the most predominant Y-chromosomal haplogroup in the overall Slavic gene pool.&lt;ref name=pericic/&gt;&lt;ref name=marjanovic /&gt;
*[[Haplogroup R1b1 (Y-DNA)|R1b1b2]]-M269, 10.62 and 6.20%. Its frequency peaks in Western Europe (90% in [[Wales]]) followed by Central Europe with [[West Slavs]] having the highest frequency of it out of all Slavic groups.&lt;ref name=pericic/&gt;&lt;ref name=marjanovic/&gt;
*[[Haplogroup K (Y-DNA)|K*]]-M9, 7.08% and 7.40%.&lt;ref name=pericic/&gt;&lt;ref name=marjanovic/&gt;
*[[Haplogroup J2 (Y-DNA)|J2b]]-M102, 4.40% and 6.20%.&lt;ref name=pericic/&gt;&lt;ref name=marjanovic/&gt;
*[[Haplogroup I1 (Y-DNA)|I1]]-M253, 5.31% and 2.5%.&lt;ref name=pericic/&gt;&lt;ref name=marjanovic/&gt;
*[[Haplogroup F (Y-DNA)|F*]]-M89, 4.9%, only in B-H.&lt;ref name=pericic/&gt;&lt;ref name=marjanovic/&gt;
*[[Haplogroup J2 (Y-DNA)|J2a1b1]]-M92, 2.70%, only in Serbia.&lt;ref name=pericic/&gt;&lt;ref name=marjanovic/&gt;
There are also several other uncommon haplogroups with lesser frequencies.&lt;ref name=pericic/&gt;&lt;ref name=marjanovic/&gt;

[[Y chromosome|Y-chromosom]]al [[haplogroup]]s identified among the Serbs from Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina are the following: [[Haplogroup I2 (Y-DNA)|I2a]]-P37.2 (with frequencies of 29.20 and 30.90%, respectively), [[Haplogroup E1b1b1a (Y-DNA)|E1b1b1a2]]-V13 (20.35 and 19.80%), [[R1a1]]-M17 (15.93 and 13.60%), [[Haplogroup R1b1 (Y-DNA)|R1b1b2]]-M269 (10.62 and 6.20%), [[Haplogroup K (Y-DNA)|K*]]-M9 (7.08 and 7.40%), [[Haplogroup J2 (Y-DNA)|J2b]]-M102 (4.40 and 6.20%), [[Haplogroup I1 (Y-DNA)|I1]]-M253 (5.31 and 2.5%), [[Haplogroup F (Y-DNA)|F*]]-M89 (4.9%, only in B-H), [[Haplogroup J2 (Y-DNA)|J2a1b1]]-M92 (2.70%, only in Serbia), and several other uncommon haplogroups with lesser frequencies.&lt;ref name=pericic/&gt;&lt;ref name=marjanovic&gt;{{harvnb|Marjanović et al.|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=battaglia&gt;{{harvnb|Battaglia et al.|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I2a-P37.2 is the most prevailing haplogroup, accounting for nearly one-third of Serbian Y-chromosomes. Its frequency peaks in [[Herzegovina]] (64%), and its variance peaks over a large geographic area covering B-H, Serbia, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Geneticists estimate that I2a-P37.2 originated some 10,000 years before present (ybp) in the Balkans, from where it began to expand to Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe about 7000 ybp. It is the second most predominant Y-chromosomal haplogroup in the overall Slavic gene pool. [[South Slavs#Migrations and "homeland"|Slavic migrations]] to the Balkans in the early Middle Ages contributed to the frequency and variance of I2a-P37.2 in the region.&lt;ref name=pericic/&gt;

E1b1b1a2-V13 is the second most prevailing haplogroup, accounting for one-fifth of Serbian Y chromosomes. In Southeast Europe, its frequency peaks at the southeastern edge of the region and its variance peaks in the region's southwest. Although its frequency is very high in Kosovo Albanians (46%) and [[Macedonian Romani]] (30%), this phenomenon is of a focal rather than a clinal nature, most likely being a consequence of [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref name=pericic/&gt; This haplogroup is also high among [[Albanians in Macedonia]] (34%) and Albania (24%), as well as [[Ethnic Macedonians]], and [[Greeks]]. It is rare among other Slavs, and moderate frequencies of it are found in southern Italy and [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref name=pericic/&gt;&lt;ref name=battaglia/&gt; E-V13 probably originated in the southern Balkans about 9000 ybp. Its ancestral haplogroup, E1b1b1a-M78, could be of a northeast African origin.&lt;ref name=battaglia/&gt;

R1a1-M17 accounts for about one-seventh to one-sixth of Serbian Y-chromosomes. Its frequency peaks in Ukraine (54.0%), and its variance peaks in northern Bosnia.&lt;ref name=pericic/&gt; It is the most predominant haplogroup in the general Slavic paternal gene pool. The variance of R1a1 in the Balkans might have been enhanced by infiltrations of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] speaking peoples between 2000 and 1000 BC, and by the Slavic migrations to the region in the early Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=pericic/&gt;&lt;ref name=marjanovic/&gt; A descendant lineage of R1a1-M17, R1a1a7-M458, which has the highest frequency in Central and Southern Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Underhill PA, Myres NM, Rootsi S, etal |title=Separating the post-Glacial coancestry of European and Asian Y chromosomes within haplogroup R1a |journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=479–84 |date=April 2010 |pmid=19888303 |pmc=2987245 |doi=10.1038/ejhg.2009.194 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R1b1b2-M269 is moderately represented among Serbian males (6–10%). It has its frequency peak in Western Europe (90% in [[Wales]]), but a high frequency is also found in [[Central Europe]] among the [[West Slavs]] ([[Poles]], [[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]]) and [[Hungarians]] as well as in the [[Caucasus]] among the [[Ossetians]] (43%).&lt;ref name=pericic/&gt; It was introduced to Europe by farmers migrating from western Anatolia, probably about 7500 ybp. Serb bearers of this haplogroup are in the same cluster as Central and East European ones, as indicated by the frequency distributions of its sub-haplogroups with respect to total R-M269. The other two clusters comprise, respectively, West Europeans and a group of populations from Greece, Turkey, the Caucasus and the [[Urals|Circum-Uralic]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Myres NM, Rootsi S, Lin AA, etal |title=A major Y-chromosome haplogroup R1b Holocene era founder effect in Central and Western Europe |journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=95–101 |date=January 2011 |pmid=20736979 |pmc=3039512 |doi=10.1038/ejhg.2010.146 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J2b-M102 and J2a1b1-M92 have low frequencies among the Serbs (6–7% combined). Various other lineages of haplogroup J2-M172 are found throughout the Balkans, all with low frequencies. [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup J]] and all its descendants originated in the Middle East. It is proposed that the Balkan [[Mesolithic]] foragers, bearers of I-P37.2 and E-V13, adopted farming from the initial J2 agriculturalists who colonized the region about 7000 to 8000 ybp, transmitting the [[Neolithic]] cultural package.&lt;ref name=battaglia/&gt;

An [[analysis of molecular variance]] based on Y-chromosomal [[Short tandem repeat|STR]]s showed that Slavs can be divided into two  groups: one encompassing [[West Slavs]] (Poles, Czechs, Slovaks), Hungarians, [[East Slavs]] (only [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]]), [[Slovenes]], and western [[Croats]], and the other encompassing Bulgarians, Ethnic Macedonians, Serbs, [[Bosniaks]], [[Russians]] and southern Croats. This distinction could be explained by a genetic contribution of pre-Slavic Balkan populations to the genetic heritage of some South Slavs belonging to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17364156 | year = 2007 | last1 = Rebała | first1 = K | last2 = Mikulich | first2 = AI | last3 = Tsybovsky | first3 = IS | last4 = Siváková | first4 = D | last5 = Dzupinková | first5 = Z | last6 = Szczerkowska-Dobosz | first6 = A | last7 = Szczerkowska | first7 = Z | title = Y-STR variation among Slavs: Evidence for the Slavic homeland in the middle Dnieper basin | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 406–14 | doi = 10.1007/s10038-007-0125-6 | journal = Journal of Human Genetics }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Principal component analysis]] of Y-chromosomal haplogroup frequencies among the three ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks, showed that Serbs and Bosniaks are genetically closer to each other than either of them is to Croats.&lt;ref name=marjanovic/&gt;

==Physical anthropology==
According to Serbian physical anthropologist Živko Mikić, the medieval population of Serbia developed a [[phenotype]] that represented a mixture of Slavic and indigenous Balkan [[Dinaric race|Dinaric traits]]. Mikić argues that the Dinaric traits, such as [[Cephalic index|brachycephaly]] and a bigger average height, have been since then becoming predominant over the Slavic traits among Serbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikić | first1 = Živko |name-list-format=vanc | year = 1994 | title = Beitrag zur Anthropologie der Slawen auf dem mittleren und westlichen Balkan".

[[File:Goetter Graeber und Gelehrte.png|thumb|Cover of a German edition of ''Gods, Graves, and Scholars''.]]
'''''Gods, Graves, and Scholars''''' is a book by German writer [[C. W. Ceram]] about the history of [[archaeology]]. First published in 1949, Ceram's book introduced the general reading public to the origin and development of archaeology. It sold extremely well — over five million copies have been published in 30 languages — and remains in print today.

The book covers [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[Mesopotamia]]n, as well as [[Mexico|Mexican]], [[Central America]]n, and [[South America]]n archaeology. It gives brief biographies of archaeologists like [[Heinrich Schliemann]], [[Jean-François Champollion]], [[Paul-Émile Botta]], and [[Howard Carter (archaeologist)|Howard Carter]], among others.

A '''grammeme''' in [[linguistics]] is a unit of [[grammar]], just as a [[lexeme]] is a lexical unit and a [[morpheme]] is a morphological unit. (See [[emic unit]].)

More specifically, a grammeme is a value of a [[grammatical category]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Recent advances in computational linguistics
  | url = http://www.freepatentsonline.com/article/Informatica/233291025.html 
  | accessdate = 2011-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, singular and plural are grammemes of the category of [[grammatical number|number]].

''Grammeme'', earlier spelt ''grameme'', was the original term used by [[Kenneth Pike|Pike]]'s school for what they went on to call the ''[[tagmeme]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, K.L. (1958), "On tagmemes, née gramemes", ''International Journal of American Linguistics'' 24(4):273ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''I quattro libri dell'architettura''''' (''The Four Books of Architecture'') is a treatise on [[architecture]] by the architect [[Andrea Palladio]] (1508–1580), written in [[Italian language|Italian]].  It was first published in four [[volume]]s in 1570 in [[Venice]], illustrated with woodcuts after the author's own drawings. It has been reprinted and translated many times, often in single-volume format.

Book I was first published in English in 1663 in a London edition by Godfrey Richards. The first complete English language edition was published in London by the Italian-born architect [[Giacomo Leoni]] in 1715-1720.&lt;ref&gt;The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., "Palladio and his Books." http://www.palladiancenter.org/palladiobooks.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==

The treatise is divided into four books:

The First book discusses building materials and techniques.  It documents five [[classical order]]s (Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, composite) in all their parts (bases, columns, architraves, arches, capitals, trabeations), as well as discussing other building elements (vaulted ceilings, floors, doors and windows, fireplaces, roofs and stairs).

The Second book covers the designs of private urban townhouses and country villas of the 1500s, in and around Venice, almost all designed by Palladio himself.  This includes nine palazzi, 22 villas (13 of them completed, another 5 partly completed), and a series of unrealized projects.  The plates of completed projects sometimes differ from the buildings as actually constructed.

The Third book addresses matters of city planning:  streets, stone street paving, bridges of both stone and wood, and piazzas, with examples drawn from Roman origins alongside contemporary examples; also basilicas, including the basilica designed by [[Vitruvius]] in [[Fano]] and the important [[Basilica Palladiana]] in Vicenza.

The Fourth book contains five chapters of general introduction, then 26 chapters, each of which describe the designs of specific Roman temples dating from antiquity, along with one contemporary church design.  (The exception is the [[San Pietro in Montorio]], designed by [[Donato Bramante]], consecrated in the year 1500.)  Palladio's selections range geographically from Rome, Naples, Spoleto, Assisi, Pola and Nîmes.  Illustrations of the temples include careful measurements of existing building elements, together with Palladio's own conjectural interpretations of the temple's facades where only fragments remained, as at the [[Temple of Trajan]].

The 26 temples discussed in include:

==Author==
Palladio founded an architectural movement which takes its name from him, [[Palladian architecture]]. ''I quattro libri dell'architettura'' contains Palladio's own designs celebrating the purity and simplicity of [[classical architecture]]. Some of these ideas had gotten no further than the drawing board while others, for example [[villa]] plans, had been successfully built. The book's clarity inspired numerous [[patron]]s and other architects.  Palladian architecture grew in popularity across [[Europe]] and, by the end of the 18th century, had extended as far as [[North America]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[President of the United States]], was a keen admirer of Palladio and once referred to the book as "the Bible". ''The Four Books'' was used to inform his own work as the architect of [[Monticello]] and the [[University of Virginia]] and also architect William Buckland's at the 1774 Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis, Maryland.

Palladio drew inspiration from surviving Roman buildings, Roman authors (especially the architect [[Vitruvius]]) and Italian Renaissance architects.  However, ''The Four Books of Architecture'' provided [[:wikt:systematic|systematic]] rules and plans for buildings which were creative and unique. Palladio's villa style is based on details applied to a structural system built of bricks. He offers two types of general rules in the corpus: design rules (those based on appearance) and construction rules (those based on the logic of villa construction). Here rules of the two types are identified in sets from which subsets of identifiers and rules can be written.

Each of the nine rule-sets contains many sub-identities of components and procedures for physical construction. A rule-set such as “Walls”, that identifies five sub-rules based on wall thickness, only needs construction rules; there is no need for rules based on style. In contrast, rules for “Frames” are based on a geometric style of curves and shape proportions. The results will yield clear identities for a shape [[grammar]] [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] that can be based on physical construction and visual style.

==Rule-sets==
These identities are taken from the first book of architecture and a survey of built villas. These are the nine rule-sets that define identity:[[Image:Villa Pisani.jpg|thumb|right|[[Villa Pisani (Bagnolo)]] in ''I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura'']]
#Walls — [[parametric equation|parametric]] [[formula]]
#Ceilings — parametric formula
#Stairs — parametric formula
#Columns — parametric object
#Doors — parametric formula
#Windows — parametric formula
#Frames — parametric object
#Roof — parametric formula
#Details — parametric object and formula

'''Iberian Books''' is a bibliographical research project set up to chart the development of printing in Spain, Portugal and the New World in the early-modern period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iberian.ucd.ie/about/ | title = About Iberian Books| work = website of the project team | accessdate = 2016-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It offers a catalogue of what was known to have been printed, along with a survey of surviving copies and links to digital editions.&lt;ref&gt; Alexander S. Wilkinson, 'Exploring the Print World of Early-Modern Iberia', ''Bulletin of Spanish Studies'' (2012), 89 (4):491-506 and Alejandra Ulla Lorenzo, 'Iberian Book Project (1472-1650): sobre los usos del catálogo en el estudio del impreso científico antiguo'. ''Ciencias y traducción en el mundo hispánico. 3, Mantua, "Pliegos" &lt;/ref&gt;  It is funded by the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://mellon.org/grants/grants-database/grants/university-college-dublin-national-university-of-ireland/41000633/ | title = Mellon Grant Awards| accessdate = 2016-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The records created are made available in an open-access database under a [[Creative Commons]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iberian.ucd.ie/terms/  | title = Terms of Use| accessdate = 2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2007 and based in the School of History at [[University College Dublin]], as of December 2016 the project has made available data for the period from the beginning of printing in the Iberian Peninsula around 1472 to the middle of the seventeenth century. In late 2017, the project expects to publish the datasets for the second half of the seventeenth century.  The datasets currently available online (1472-1650) hold information on 66,000 items, 339,000 copies, and 15,000 digital copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iberian.ucd.ie/about/ | title = About Iberian Books| work = project website | accessdate = 2016-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project works in partnership with the [[University College Dublin Library|Digital Library Group]] at University College Dublin and with the [[Universal Short Title Catalogue|Universal Short Title Catalogue Project]] based at the [[University of St Andrews]].

==Project==
Iberian Books is a bibliographical resource similar to the [[English Short Title Catalogue]], helping to identify works by a given author or publisher, or on a given subject.&lt;ref&gt;See David McKitterick, 'Bibliography, Population and Statistics', in Joseph P. McDermott and Peter Burke (eds.), ''The Book Worlds of East Asia and Europe, 1450-1800. Connections and Comparisons'' (Hong Kong: HKU, 2015), p. 82 &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it helps in identifying and mapping broader publishing trends.&lt;ref&gt; For the contours of publishing revealed by the data, see the introductions to the printed catalogue Alexander S. Wilkinson (ed.), ''Iberian Books. Books Published in Spanish or Portuguese or on the Iberian Peninsula before 1601'', (Leiden: Brill, 2010)'&lt;/ref&gt;  The datasets are published via a platform that facilitates the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) harvesting of metadata in OAI-compliant Dublin Core and Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iberian.ucd.ie/about/ | title = About Iberian Books| work = project website | accessdate = 2016-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The datasets have also been incorporated in the open-access Universal Short Title Catalogue (USTC) based at the [[University of St Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ustc.ac.uk/index.php/site/about/ | title = Information on the USTC Project| work = project website | accessdate = 2016-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dataset has been cited in academic monographs and journal articles, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=15151406177877744807&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en | title = Google Scholar| work = Google Scholar Citations for Iberian Books | accessdate = 2016-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by major auction houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.pdf.L11406.html/f/25/L11406-25.pdf | title = Sotheby's Auction Catalogue 2011| accessdate = 2016-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4619">The '''International Work Group for Palaeoethnobotany''' is an international archaeological conference for [[Paleoethnobotany|archaeobotanists]]. The conference focuses on the study of plant macrofossils in order to reconstruct past subsistence, trade, construction, ritual, and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archaeobotany.org/index.php|title=International Work Group for Palaeoethnobotany IWGP - archaeobotany.org - palaeoethnobotany.org - seeds and fruits, chaff, wood, ecofacts, palaeoeconomy, palaeoenvironment, human impact, bioarchaeology, archaeobotany, palaeoethnobotany, subsistence, on-site-data|website=www.archaeobotany.org|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The first meeting in 1968 consisted of 11 people and took place at [[Kačina]], near Prague. The meeting was termed the Internationale Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Paläoethnobotanik. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Progress in Old World Palaeoethnobotany|last=Van Zeist|first=W|last2=Wasylikowa|first2=K|last3=Behre|first3=K.-E.|publisher=Balkems|year=1991|isbn=|location=Rotterdam|pages=vii–ix|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bittmann|first=Felix|last2=Mueller-Bieniek|first2=Aldona|date=2008-11-12|title=Proceedings of the 14th symposium of the international work group for palaeoethnobotany, Kraków 2007|url=http://doi.org/10.1007/s00334-008-0197-z|journal=Vegetation History and Archaeobotany|language=en|volume=17|issue=S1|pages=3–4|doi=10.1007/s00334-008-0197-z|issn=0939-6314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IWGP was partly founded in order to enable the compilation of archaeobotanical data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Interlacing patterns''' are patterns of lines and shapes that have traditionally dominated [[Islamic art]]. They can be broadly divided into the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]], using curving plant-based elements, and the [[girih]], using mostly [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometrical forms]] with straight lines or regular curves.  Both of these forms of [[Islamic art]] developed from the rich [[Interlace (visual arts)|interlacing patterns]]  of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and from [[Coptic art]].

==Overview==
Eva Baer, in her book ''Islamic Ornament'' (1998), describes the art:
&lt;blockquote&gt;....the intricate interlacings common in later medieval [[Islamic art]], are already prefigured in [[Umayyad architecture]] revetments: in floor [[mosaics]], window grilles, stone and [[stucco]] carvings and wall paintings(Khirbat al-Mafjar, Qusayr'Amra, Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi etc.), and in the decoration of a whole group of early east Iranian, eighth- to tenth-century metal objects.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Baer ''Islamic Ornament'' p. 41. New York University Press, 1998 {{ISBN|0-8147-1329-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the first Western studies of the subject was [[Ernest Hanbury Hankin|E. H. Hankin]]'s "The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art", published in ''Memoirs of the Archaeological Society of India'' in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamic-art.org/ArticlesOnline/BArchViewPage.asp?ArticleID=108&amp;PO=1#viewpage "The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art"], [https://www.flickr.com/photos/cosmolallie/2073854747/in/set-72157603842997257/ "Preface"]&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay, Hankin takes the view that the artists who created these designs used a method based on the use of the compass and the straight edge.&lt;ref&gt;E. H Hankin, ''The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art'', p.2&lt;/ref&gt; This view is supported by the majority of contemporary authorities on the subject, such as [[Keith Critchlow]] in his book, ''Islamic Patterns: An Analytical and Cosmological Approach''.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Critchlow, ''Islamic Patterns: An Analytical and Cosmological Approach'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; This explains how ornamented objects as varied in size as a book or a mosque, were treated by artists using the same geometric methods adapted to the size and nature of the object being ornamented.&lt;ref&gt;Daud Sutton, ''Islamic Design: A Genius for Geometry'', Walker Publishing Company, 2007. p. 1. ({{ISBN|0-8027-1635-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]] describes a method whereby interlace ornament is designed on a foundation of geometric [[wikt:grid|grids]], with the same grids re-drawn to the size of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Owen Jones, ''The Grammar of Ornament'', p. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;
In his catalog for the ''[[The Great Exhibition|Crystal Palace]]'' exhibition, Jones wrote about the decorative art found in the [[Alhambra]], where much of the decoration consists of interwoven designs, that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The grace and refinement of Greek ornament is here surpassed. Possessing, equally with the Greeks, an appreciation of pure form, the Moors exceeded them in variety and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Iain Zaczek quoting Owen Jones, in his annotation of Owen Jones' ''The Grammar of Ornament'', p.206&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Arabesque==
{{main|Arabesque (Islamic art)}}

The Islamic arabesque is a form of artistic decoration consisting of "surface decorations based on rhythmic linear patterns of scrolling and interlacing foliage, tendrils" or plain lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Fleming, John |author2=Honour, Hugh |title=Dictionary of the Decorative Arts |year=1977 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-670-82047-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; often combined with other elements. It usually consists of a single design which can be 'tiled' or seamlessly repeated as many times as desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, Francis |title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-66993-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

==Girih==
{{main|Girih}}

'''Girih''' ({{lang-fa|[[wikt:گره#Persian|گره]]}}, "knot"), also '''''girih sāzī''''' ({{lang|fa|گره سازی}}, "knot making") or '''''girih chīnī''''' ({{lang|fa|گره چینی}}), is an [[Islamic art|Islamic decorative art]] form used in [[architecture]] and handicrafts (book covers, tapestry, small metal objects), consisting of  [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric lines]] that form an [[Interlace (art)|interlaced]] [[strapwork]]. In [[Iranian architecture]], ''gereh sazi'' patterns were seen in [[banna'i]] brickwork, [[stucco]], and [[mosaic]] [[faience]] work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gereh Sazi | work=Encyclopaedia Iranica Online| accessdate=15 December 2015| url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gereh-sazi }}&lt;/ref&gt; Girih has been defined as "geometric (often star-and-polygon) designs composed upon or generated from arrays of points from which construction lines radiate and at which they intersect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Allen, Terry |year=2004 | title=Islamic Art and the Argument from Academic Geometry | url=http://sonic.net/~tallen/palmtree/academicgeometry.htm | accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  ISCR ('''Instituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro''': High Institute for Conservation and Restoration - formerly '''Istituto Centrale di Restauro''': "Central Institute of Restoration - ICR") is a body of the [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities (Italy)|Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and tourism]] in [[Rome]].  Together with the [[Opificio delle Pietre Dure]] in [[Florence]], it is one of the most notable and prestigious institutes in the field of [[art restoration]] and art restoration instruction.

Since 1944 there has been a state school for art conservation training inside the Institute in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iscr.beniculturali.it/ ISCR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127015710/http://www.iscr.beniculturali.it/ |date=2012-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006 its diploma is equivalent to a degree course, similar to a master's degree in the US. The courses are limited: to access one must pass an appropriate public contest announced by the [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities (Italy)|Ministry of Heritage and Culture]]. The training lasts five years and the diploma is subject to the acquisition of 300 credits.  In this school they taught such important art historians as [[Cesare Brandi]], and other scientists of conservation-restoration, such as microbiologist [[Clelia Giacobini]].

'''''Istjude''''', in the [[Nazi]] jargon, was a person with at least three ethnic [[Jews|Jewish]] grandparents. 

''Istjuden'' were legally equated with the so-called ''[[Geltungsjude]]n'' (''gelten'' = to be considered as, ''ist'' = is).

''' Joel Beinin''' is Donald J. McLachlan Professor of History and Professor of Middle East History at [[Stanford University]].  From 2006 to 2008 he served as Director of Middle East Studies and Professor of History at the [[American University in Cairo]].

==Education==

Beinin was raised as a [[Zionist]] in an American [[Jew]]ish family. On graduating from high school, he spent six months working on a [[kibbutz]], where he met his future wife. He studied [[Arabic language|Arabic]] at university, and  received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]]  from [[Princeton University]] in 1970. He spent the summer of 1969 studying Arabic at the [[American University in Cairo]]. Intending to move to [[Israel]] permanently, he joined other members of [[Hashomer Hatzair]] in living and working at Kibbutz [[Lahav]]. There, on encountering attitudes that struck him as being contemptuous of [[Palestinians]],&lt;ref&gt;'I tended livestock on Kibbutz Lahav, which was established on the ruins of three Palestinian villages. The Palestinian inhabitants had been expelled and, because they are not Jewish, were unable to return. One day, we needed extra workers to help clean manure from the turkey cages. The head of the turkey branch said we should not ask for kibbutz members to do the work because, 'This isn't work for Jews. This is work for Arabushim'. ''Arabushim'' is an extremely derogatory racial term.' Joel Beinin, '[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/02/04/INGFLNSJQJ1.DTL&amp;hw=beinin&amp;sn=003&amp;sc=264  'Silencing Critics Not Way to Middle East Peace.'], in  [[San Francisco Chronicle]], February 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; he gradually became disenchanted with his early ideals. He returned to the United States in 1973, and took his M.A. from [[Harvard University]] in 1974, and, after working in  auto plants in [[Detroit]], obtained his A.M.L.S. and [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1978 and 1982, respectively. He has also studied at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].

== Research and career ==
Beinin's research and writing focuses on workers, peasants, and minorities in the modern [[Middle East]]. Though initially interested in the rise of an Arab [[Working class]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]], under his thesis supervisor's advice, he changed the topic of his doctoral thesis to a history of the Egyptian labor movement since 1936. That Ph.D. thesis was combined with one covering an earlier period of Egyptian labor history by his friend and colleague Zachary Lockman and resulted in the publication of ''Workers on the Nile: Nationalism, Communism, Islam and the Egyptian Working Class, 1882–1954'' (1989). Among his later work is a study of the Jewish communities of modern Egypt which led to his major historical study, ''The Dispersion Of Egyptian Jewry: Culture, Politics, And The Formation Of A Modern Diaspora'' (1998), which examines the diversity of Egyptian Jewish identities in Egypt and in the [[diaspora]]. He has engaged in fieldwork to collect oral reports among many [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Egyptian Jewish communities]] dispersed throughout the world after the [[Suez Crisis|Suez War]] of 1956, among them the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]] of [[San Francisco]].

In 2002 he served as President of the [[Middle East Studies Association of North America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/~beinin/ Joel Beinin's personal web page]. Last accessed January 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Director of Graduate Studies in the History Department at [[Stanford University]] in 2002–2004 and again in 2005–06, but then took a leave of absence from that institution in order to take up a position as Director of Middle East Studies at the American University in Cairo. At the time he said that Stanford was institutionally uninterested in the study and teaching of the modern Middle East.

Beinin has written four books and co-edited three others and published many scholarly articles.

He is also active as a commentator on issues regarding [[Israel]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. He has been a contributing editor to ''[[Middle East Report]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/~beinin/&lt;/ref&gt; and has published articles in, among others, ''[[The Nation]]'' and ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]''.

In 2006 Beinin sued conservative writer [[David Horowitz]] for copyright infringement after Horowitz used Beinin's image on the cover of a booklet entitled "Campus Support for Terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2006/08/04/MNGILKB6U71.DTL&amp;type=politics |title=STANFORD IDEOLOGICAL WAR LEADS TO SUIT / Middle East professor sues conservative who linked criticism of Bush to terrorism |first=Carrie |last=Sturrock |date=August 4, 2006 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the case ended in an out of court settlement in which Horowitz donated $27,500 to charity but admitted no liability.&lt;ref name='week'&gt;{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Cohler-Esses |title=A Picture Is Worth... |date=2008-02-22 |work=The New York Jewish Week |pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''luminogram''' is an image created by exposure of [[photosensitive]] materials to light without the intervention of an object.

==Technique==
The light is modulated by varying the intensity through distance from the photosensitive surface, the power of the light source, or by the use of filters or gels or motion of the light.  The paper can itself be shaped to create the desired effects in the final image.  Many of [[László Moholy-Nagy]]'s [[photogram]]s were luminograms. The image is created by variations in light shape and intensity. They can be created using a small light source, as from a flashlight, that is moved to expose the photosensitive [[substrate (printing)|substrate]]. Moholy-Nagy used this technique to create many of his photograms.
Gottfried Jäger (photographic theorist) describes this as "the result of pure light design; the rudimentary expression of an interaction of light and photosensitive material… a kind of self representation of light."

==Luminograms: then and now==

'''[[László Moholy-Nagy]]''' (1895-1946), American, born in Austria-Hungary (in Bacsborsod).  Moved to Vienna in late 1919 after serving in the Austro-Hungarian army.
In 1919 he and his wife Lucia Moholy began experimenting with the process of making photograms, and Lucia Moholy (Czechoslovakia) developed a technique they called the photogram.

Moholy-Nagy produced photogram and luminogram images from 1922 in Berlin continuously until his death in 1946. 
Chronologically they can be considered from three groups of images: 
Berlin Bauhaus period (1923-1928), 
his period of exile in London (1935-1937), 
and the United States (1937-1946). [http://www.fundaciotapies.org/site/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=471]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.
Moholy-Nagy considered the "mysteries" of the light effects and the analysis of space as experienced through the photogram to be important principles that he experimentally explored and advanced in his teaching throughout his life. [László Moholy-Nagy, Vision in Motion (1947)]. 
Moholy-Nagy's luminograms are completely about light and design. Moholy-Nagy approached the light sensitive photographic paper as a blank canvas and used light to literally paint on the surface with and without the interference of an intervening object. (Andreas Haus, "Laszló Moholy-Nagy, Photographs and Photograms," Pantheon Books, 1980, translation from the German by Frederick Sanson  pp 51–52)
 
'''Jo Bradford''' (born 1972), Contemporary Visual Artist, specialising in contemporary colour reversal luminograms, [[cliché verre]] and [[photogram]]s.  Born Hertfordshire, UK, Lives &amp; works in Cornwall, UK.  Graduated [[University College Falmouth]] (with Distinction) MA: Photographic Critical Practice, 2004. Bradford creates Colour Luminograms, sometimes referred to as Lumigrams.  Works in private studio darkroom, exhibits regularly.  Bradford originated as a member of the "Seeing The Light" stable of photographic artists, including Jonathan Shaw, in the early 2000s, under the wing of "Seeing the Light" company director, Rhonda Wilson MBE.

Bradfords work and that of Martina Corry grow out of spontaneity of hand and arm movement, paradoxically disciplined by an imposed compositional order. Masks are placed where the light should not reach and make its mark, during each distinct exposure period. It is in the distance from the surface and the speed and direction of the movement that the work is allowed to be spontaneous.  Debate surrounds the fact that some of the works by all of these artist could be classed as cliché verre - a contemporary re-visioning of an older process, the technique was popular in the 1850s with such French artists as Camille Corot, Jean-François Millet, Théodore Rousseau, and Eugène Delacroix. The most prominent 20th-century exponent of cliché-verre was the Hungarian-American designer [[György Kepes]], and the technique was also explored by [[Joan Fontcuberta]] in his "Frottogram" series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jca-online.com/fontcuberta.html Joan Fontcuberta (interview with A. D. Coleman).] ''Journal of Contemporary Art'' 1991;4(1):34-48. Retrieved 10 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martina Corry''' is a visual artist, living and working in Ireland, within the field of photography, she graduated from the University of Ulster in 1999 with an MFA (with Distinction) specialising in photography.  She creates black and white luminograms often presented on aluminium, which have been exhibited in Ireland.  These black and white works are more akin to the earlier works of Moholy-Nagy than the more contemporary colour work of Bradford and Rob and Nick Carter

'''Rob and Nick Carter's''' luminogram work are in the medium of Cibachrome, the Carters have spent a decade of experimenting with the photogram, on the border of painting and photography.  The colour modulations are orientated around blue, green, orange and purple and developed out of the artists' fascination with the orange/blue complementarity of Goethe's colour circle.

'''Jon Lybrook''' of Colorado, USA has been making luminograms since the early 1990s.  Inspired by the work of avant-garde filmmaker [[Stan Brakhage]], [http://chronosynthesis.com/jon-lybrook.html Jon Lybrook's] [http://lytescapes.com Lytescapes Series] of luminograms combine painting and photography, employing ortho-chromatic graphics art film, custom photo chemicals, and a variety of masking techniques.

'''Mike Jackson''' (born 1966) is a British experimental and fine art photographer based in North Dorset, England. He moved away from working with traditional camera techniques in 2015 and is currently progressing the Luminogram process into new directions in which he has become regarded as a leading practitioner.
Past awards and accolades include being named a Finalist for the Hasselblad Masters Award (2008, 2009, 2010) and winner of the 2013 Chris Beetles Award.
His work has been exhibited internationally and is part of various private collections. His work with the Luminogram process is based around the concept of 'sculpting light' for photographic paper to 'translate' into form.  He has been quoted as saying that the Luminogram process allows him to use nature as a reference rather than as a subject from which to copy.

'''Manyikeni''' is a Mozambican [[archaeological site]], around 52&amp;nbsp;km west of the coastal city of [[Vilanculos]]. The archaeological site dates from the twelfth to seventeenth century. It is believed to be part of the [[Great Zimbabwe]] tradition of architecture, distinguished by mortarless stone walls, and part of the famous [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mwenu Mutapa’s Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mozaictravel.net/?p=646|title=Manyikeni – Vilanculos Ruins|work=Mozaic Travel|accessdate=3 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central stone enclosure complex is built in this tradition, and the find of a Zimbabwe-style iron gong at the site also suggests cultural ties.

The site today is covered by the ''[[Cenchrus ciliaris]]'' grass, commonly found in Zimbabwe but not in Mozambique. Berger suggests that this may indicate the grass was introduced along with cattle from Zimbabwe. The site is located 350&amp;nbsp;km from [[Great Zimbabwe]], the capital of a large, pre-colonial empire active from at least the 11th through the 14th centuries. Barker (1978) has suggested that only the ruling elite at Manyikeni consumed beef, as cattle bones have been found only in the central part of the site. The lower classes who lived at the periphery of the site ate meat from [[wikt:ovicaprid|ovi-caprines]]. The presence of a large number of glass beads and seashells at the site have led to speculation that the settlement traded extensively with the ancient coastal settlement of [[Chibuene]].

Manyikeni can be reached from [[Vilanculos]] by driving to the EN1 and then travelling south for 30&amp;nbsp;km. At the small town of Mapinhane, turn right and drive west for 29&amp;nbsp;km. A small sign shows the entrance to a small track that leads for 3&amp;nbsp;km before reaching the ruins.

==Overview of the site==

The site is located on the eastern coastal plains of the Indian Ocean and one of the only Zimbabwean tradition stone enclosures relatively near the coast, emphasizing the site’s role as a coastal trade location. Most importantly, the site appears to have had an important trade relationship with the site located 50 km away, Chibuene, an important Indian Ocean trade network site in the late first millennium AD to the 1700s AD. Occupation of the site begins at about 1200 AD and lasting until 1700 AD. This occupation period is typically broken up into three periods: 1200 AD in which the stone enclosure was being built; 1200-1450 AD in which consists of the height of occupation; and to 1700 AD in which the site was abandoned.&lt;ref name=Macamo153&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macamo|first1=Solange|title=Privileged Places in South Central Mozambique: The Archaeology of Manyikeni, Niamara, Songo, and Degue-Mufa|date=2006|publisher=African and Comparative Archaeology|location=Uppsala University|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone enclosure was excavated for the first time in 1975 and 1976, shortly after Mozambique independence by the Eduardo Mondlande University Centre for African Studies and the British Institute in Eastern Africa to 1978. The research in this period determined that the site was a later Iron Age farming community of the Great Zimbabwean tradition, potentially used as a trade outpost with Chibuene.

==Stone enclosure==

The most distinguishing feature of the site is the stone enclosure reflecting that of the Great Zimbabwe tradition. This enclosure measures 20 meters in diameter with a height of 50 cm, making it much smaller in size than the enclosure of Great Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name=Cyclopaedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Manyikeni |url=http://www.cyclopaedia.es/wiki/Manyikeni |website=Cyclopaedia |accessdate=5 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218190834/http://www.cyclopaedia.es/wiki/Manyikeni |archivedate=18 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone enclosure was constructed without mortar in a similar fashion to Great Zimbabwe, further emphasizing its association with this tradition. Construction was undertaken with the use of limestone, differing from other Great Zimbabwe associated sites that used granite. This was due to the higher availability of limestone in the surrounding region which follows the pattern of other periphery sites of the Great Zimbabwe tradition that utilized resources from the surrounding region, rather than importation of granite for the construction of the stone enclosures. Great Zimbabwe stone enclosure construction was affected by the given location of the site with the availability of stone determining the size of the stone enclosure of the particular site. Granite was the most malleable construction material used by the Great Zimbabwe tradition, but as for limestone at Manyikeni, this material was much more difficult to shape into building blocks.&lt;ref name=Macamo152&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macamo|first1=Solange|title=Privileged Places in South Central Mozambique: The Archaeology of Manyikeni, Niamara, Songo, and Degue-Mufa|date=2006|publisher=African and Comparative Archaeology|location=Uppsala University|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the use of limestone was partly responsible for the much smaller size of the stone enclosure at the site.

== World Heritage status ==
This site was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on September 15, 1997 in the cultural category.

'''Milton J. "Milt" Rosenberg''' (April 15, 1925 – January 9, 2018) was a prominent [[social psychology|social psychologist]] who was professor of psychology at the [[University of Chicago]] and was the host of a long-running radio program in [[Chicago, Illinois]].

Rosenberg was awarded the [[National Humanities Medal]] in 2008 by President [[George W. Bush]], "for bringing the world of ideas to millions of listeners."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.uchicago.edu/news.php?asset_id=1489 President Bush Awards 2008 National Humanities Medals], University of Chicago News, November 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSICOP) presented Rosenberg the ''Responsibility in Journalism'' Award.&lt;ref name="Chicago 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shore|first1=Lys Ann|title=New Light on the New Age CSICOP's Chicago conference was the first to critically evaluate the New Age movement.|journal=The Skeptical Inquirer|date=1988|volume=13|issue=3|pages=226-235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rosenberg, born in [[New York City]], attended [[Brooklyn College]] (BA, 1946), the [[University of Wisconsin]] (MA, 1948), and the [[University of Michigan]] (PhD, 1953). He began his teaching career as an Instructor in Psychology at the University of Michigan (1952–54).&lt;ref&gt;John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, ''Reports of the President and of the Treasurer'', p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education career==
Rosenberg was a [[professor emeritus]] of [[psychology]] at the University of Chicago, where he served as the director of the doctoral program in Social and Organizational Psychology. Prior to coming to Chicago in the mid-1960s, he taught at [[Yale]] (1954–61), [[Ohio State University]] (1961–63), and [[Dartmouth College]] (1963–65). For a brief period Rosenberg served on the staff of the [[Naval War College]], and he has lectured at various other universities both in the United States and abroad.  He served on the Board of Trustees of Chicago's [[Shimer College]] in the late 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwsw28t2wocC&amp;pg=PA34|page=34|title=The Machine: A Field Guide to the Resurgent Right|author=Lee Fang|year=2013|isbn=1595586393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Articles==
Rosenberg wrote many articles in professional journals and political magazines.  He also wrote, coauthored, or edited a number of books, including: ''Attitude Organization and Change''; ''Theories of Cognitive Consistency''; ''Domestic Sources of Foreign Policy''; ''Beyond Conflict and Containment: Critical Studies of Military and Foreign Policy''; and ''Vietnam and the Silent Majority''. One of his areas of study was [[cognitive dissonance]] and attitude change, on which he worked closely with [[Robert P. Abelson]], among others.

== Radio show ==

From 1973 until December 20, 2012, he hosted [[WGN Radio]]'s "[[Extension 720]]," a two-hour discussion show with one hour reserved for call-ins. The program, which aired Sunday through Thursday (originally Monday through Friday) from 10 p.m. to midnight (an hour later than formerly), dealt with topics ranging from politics to financial investment to entertainment to religion to foreign policy to literature, and, as Milt says, "just about everything except pop psychology and poodle-trimming."

Calling upon journalists, academics, corporate types and just about any and every profession, Extension 720 provided highly varied nightly shows. Some of the programs heard during 2004 were:
Is War Dead?, The Iran Enigma, Crazy Horse and the Wars of the Plains, The Rise and Fall of Communism, The Changing Face of Chicago, The Films of Francis Ford Coppola, Stem Cell Research, A Night at the Opera, Bush's War Cabinet, Shakespeare's Tragedies, The Undergraduate Life, Avoiding Con Artists, Nanotechnology, The Language of the Presidency, Great Gospel Music, Contemporary Russia and The Origin and Descent of Man.

Past guests of note include such political figures as [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Henry Kissinger]], [[George Stephanopoulos]], [[George Shultz]], [[Cyrus Vance]] (and many members of the Senate and House of Representatives). Other interesting public figures who have appeared on the program include [[Colin Powell]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[William Safire]], [[Bill Murray]], [[William Bennett]], [[Richard Posner]], [[Bob Feller]], [[Betty Friedan]], [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], [[Cynthia Ozick]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Mary Higgins Clark]], [[Calvin Trillin]], [[P.D. James]], [[Peggy Noonan]], [[David Brinkley]], [[George Will]], [[Stanley Kurtz]], [[Ron Paul]], [[Gerry Spence]], [[Jim Lehrer]], [[Michael Medved]], [[Carl Sagan]], and on and on—virtually a cast of thousands of interesting and significant people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027115925/http://wgnradio.com/shows/ex720/index.html |archivedate=2007-10-27 |url=http://wgnradio.com/shows/ex720/index.html |accessdate=2009-12-13 |date= |title=Extension 720 with Milt Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2001, Neocons Fred &amp; Don Kagan were on Rosenberg's show advocating for a US military invasion of Palestine.

On December 17, 2012, WGN announced that Rosenberg would retire from his daily show on December 20, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-wgn-tweaks-lineup-as-milt-rosenberg-retires-20121217,0,4131752.story|title=Milt Rosenberg retires after 39 years at WGN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, although he will no longer be a full-time program host, the station's leaders announced that he would remain a show contributor and have a presence at the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wgnradio.com/wgnam-wgn-radio-announces-new-weekday-lineup-20121217,0,5904111.story|title=WGN Radio - 720 AM|website=WGN Radio - 720 AM}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it appears that Rosenberg did not have any continuing relationship with WGN after his forced retirement.

==Podcast==
In May 2013, Rosenberg began an independent podcast entitled ''The Milt Rosenberg Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2013/05/land-of-linkin-2.html|title=Change of Subject: Land of Linkin'|website=blogs.chicagotribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miltrosenberg.com/|title=Milt Rosenberg|website=www.miltrosenberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The podcast website featured Rosenberg doing new free interviews and offering old ones for sale.

==Return to radio==
In April 2015, Rosenberg returned to radio on [[WCGO]]-AM 1590 from [[Evanston, Illinois]], weekday evenings;&lt;ref&gt;[http://radioink.com/Article.asp?id=2924116&amp;spid=24698 Radio Ink] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520080326/http://radioink.com/Article.asp?id=2924116&amp;spid=24698 |date=2015-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in November 2015 WCGO-AM 1590 cancelled   Rosenberg's program along with the rest of its afternoon lineup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertfeder.com/2015/11/11/no-extension-for-milt-rosenberg-at-wcgo/ No extension for Milt Rosenberg] Robert Feder, November 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Rosenberg died in Chicago on January 9, 2018 of complications from [[pneumonia]] at the age of 92.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ent-milt-rosenberg-dead-0111-story.html|title=Milt Rosenberg, longtime host of WGN-AM's 'Extension 720' show, dies at 92|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Nete'''{{Pronunciation-needed}} (Νήτη) was one of the three [[Muses]] of the [[lyre]] that were worshipped at [[Delphi]], where the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] and the [[Oracle]] were located. Her name was also the lowest of the seven notes of the lyre. Her sisters that were worshipped along with her were [[Hypate]] and [[Mese (mythology)|Mese]]. These three muses were comparable to the original three, [[Aoide]], [[Melete]], and [[Mneme]]. Alternatively, they were [[Cephisso]], [[Apollonis]], and [[Borysthenis]], which portrayed them as the daughters of [[Apollo]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1927">Established by the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 2009, the '''Nicholas Rescher Prize for [[Philosophical method|Systematic Philosophy]]''' is intended to counter present-day tendencies to narrow specialization by rewarding and showcasing the work of philosophers who have addressed the historical “big questions” of the field in ways that nevertheless command the respect of specialists.

[[File:Celtic Oppidum 1st century B.C..jpg|thumb|right|400px|Modern-day rendering of a Celtic Oppidum, Central Europe 1st century BC]]
An '''''oppidum''''' (plural '''''oppida''''') is a large fortified [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]] settlement. Oppida are associated with the [[Celts|Celtic]] late [[La Tène culture]], emerging during the 2nd and 1st centuries&amp;nbsp;BC, spread across Europe, stretching from [[Iron Age Britain|Britain]] and [[Iberia]] in the west to the edge of the [[Great Hungarian Plain|Hungarian plain]] in the east. They continued in use until the Romans began conquering Europe. North of the River [[Danube]], where the population remained independent from Rome, oppida continued to be used into the 1st century AD.

==Definition==
[[File:Hallstatt.png|thumb|left|400px|The [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] cultures]]
''Oppidum'' is a [[Latin]] word meaning the main settlement in any administrative area of [[ancient Rome]], and applied more generally in Latin to smaller urban settlements than cities, equating to "town" in English (bearing in mind that ancient "cities" could be very small by modern standards). The word is derived from the earlier Latin ''ob-pedum'', "enclosed space", possibly from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*pedóm-'', "occupied space" or "footprint".

In his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', [[Julius Caesar]] described the larger [[Celt]]ic [[Iron Age]] settlements he encountered in [[Gaul]] during the [[Gallic Wars]] in 58 to 52 BC as ''oppida''. Although he did not explicitly define what features qualified a settlement to be called an ''oppidum'', the main requirements emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lukashevichus.info/knigi/ancient_europe_encycl_bogucki_crabtree_1.pdf|title=Ancient Europe 800 B.C-A.D 100|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were important economic sites, places where goods were produced, stored and traded, and sometimes Roman merchants had settled and the Roman legions could obtain supplies. They were also political centres, the seat of authorities who made decisions that affected large numbers of people, such as the appointment of [[Vercingetorix]] as head of the Gallic revolt in 52 BC.&lt;ref name = "Oppida"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rieckhoff|first1=Sabine|last2=Fichtl|first2=Stephan|title=Keltenstädte aus der Luft/AID Sonderheft Plus | language = de |publisher=WBG|year=2011|isbn = 978-3-8062-2242-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |12–13}}

Caesar named 28 oppida. By 2011, only 21 of these had been positively identified by historians and archaeologists: either there was a traceable similarity between the Latin and the modern name of the locality (e.g. Orléans-[[Cenabum]]), or excavations had provided the necessary evidence (e.g. [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]]). Most of the places that Caesar called oppida were city-sized fortified settlements. However, [[Geneva]], for example, was referred to as an oppidum, but no fortifications dating to this period have yet been discovered there. Caesar also refers to 20 oppida of the [[Bituriges]] and 12 of the [[Helvetii]], twice the number of fortified settlements of these groups known today. That implies that Caesar likely counted some unfortified settlements as oppida. A similar ambiguity is in evidence in writing by the Roman historian [[Livy]], who also used the word for both fortified and unfortified settlements.&lt;ref name="Oppida"/&gt;{{rp |13}}

In his work ''Geographia'', [[Ptolemy]] listed the coordinates of many Celtic settlements. However, research has shown many of the localisations of Ptolemy to be erroneous, making the identification of any modern location with the names he listed highly uncertain and speculative. An exception to that is the oppidum of ''Brenodurum'' at [[Bern]], which was confirmed by an archaeological discovery.&lt;ref name="Oppida"/&gt;{{rp |13}}

[[File:Bibracte, 1st century B.C.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Bibracte]] France, seen from above, 1st century BC]]
In archaeology and prehistory, the term ''oppida'' now refers to a category of settlement; it was first used in that sense by [[Paul Reinecke]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Joseph Déchelette|fr}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Wolfgang Dehn|de}} in reference to [[Bibracte]], [[Oppidum of Manching|Manching]], and [[Oppidum Závist|Závist]].&lt;ref&gt;Woolf (1993), pp.&amp;nbsp;223–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;46&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Dehn suggested defining an oppidum by four criteria: 
* Size: The settlement has to have a minimum size, defined by Dehn as {{convert|30|ha}}.
* Topography: Most oppida are situated on heights, but some are located on flat areas of land.
* Fortification: The settlement is surrounded by a (ideally uninterrupted) wall, usually consisting of three elements: a facade of stone, a wooden construction and an earthen rampart at the back. Gates are usually [[pincer gate]]s.
* Chronology: The settlement dates from the late [[Iron Age]]: the last two centuries BC.&lt;ref name="Oppida"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

In current usage, most definitions of ''oppida'' emphasise the presence of fortifications so they are different from undefended farms or settlements and from urban characteristics, marking them as separate from [[hill fort]]s. They could be referred to as "the first cities north of the Alps". The period of 2nd and 1st centuries&amp;nbsp;BC places them in the period known as [[La Tène culture|La Tène]]. A notional minimum size of {{convert|15|to|25|ha}} has often been suggested, but that is flexible and fortified sites as small as {{convert|2|ha}} have been described as oppida. However, the term is not always rigorously used, and it has been used to refer to any hill fort or [[circular rampart]] dating from the La Tène period. One of the effects of the inconsistency in definitions is that it is uncertain how many oppida were built.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf (1993), pp.&amp;nbsp;224–225&lt;/ref&gt;

In European archaeology, the term 'oppida' is also used more widely to characterize any fortified prehistoric settlement. For example, significantly older hill-top structures like the one at [[Glauberg]] (6th or 5th century BC) have been called oppida.

Such wider use of the term is, for example, common in the Iberian archaeology; in the descriptions of the [[Castro culture]] it is commonly used to refer to the settlements going back to the 9th century BC. The Spanish word 'castro', also used in English, means a walled settlement or hill fort, and this word is often used interchangeably with 'oppidum' by archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples can be seen here: M ALMAGRO-GORBEA (1995), [http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/proc/files/86p175.pdf From Hillforts to Oppida in 'Celtic' Iberia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and type==
According to prehistorian [[John Collis]] oppida extend as far east as the [[Great Hungarian Plain|Hungarian plain]] where other settlement types take over.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf (1993), p.&amp;nbsp;225&lt;/ref&gt; Central Spain has sites similar to oppida, but while they share features such as size and defensive ramparts the interior was arranged differently.&lt;ref&gt;Collis (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;229–230&lt;/ref&gt; Oppida feature a wide variety of internal structures, from continuous rows of dwellings (Bibracte) to more widely spaced individual estates (Manching). Some oppida had internal layouts resembling the ''insulae'' of Roman cities (Variscourt). Little is known, however, about the purpose of any public buildings.&lt;ref name="Oppida"/&gt;{{rp|28}}

[[File:Oppidum manching osttor.JPG|thumb|A museum model of a typical ''Zangentor'' at the [[Oppidum of Manching]] in Germany]]
The main features of the oppida are the walls and gates, the spacious layout, and usually a commanding view of the surrounding area. The major difference with earlier structures was their much larger size. Earlier hill forts were mostly just a few hectares in area, whilst oppida could encompass several dozen or even hundreds of hectares. They also played a role in displaying the power and wealth of the local inhabitants and as a line of demarcation between the town and the countryside.&lt;ref name="Oppida"/&gt;{{rp|25}} According to Jane McIntosh, the "impressive ramparts with elaborate gateways&amp;nbsp;... were probably as much for show and for controlling the movement of people and goods as for defense".&lt;ref name=McIntosh156&gt;McIntosh (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;156&lt;/ref&gt;

Size and construction varied considerably. Typically oppida in [[Bohemia]] and [[Bavaria]] were much larger than those found in the north and west of France. Typically oppida in Britain are small, but there is a group of large oppida in the south east; though oppida are uncommon in northern Britain, [[Stanwick Iron Age Fortifications|Stanwick]] stands out as an unusual example as it covers {{convert|350|ha}}. [[Dry stone]] walls supported by a bank of earth, called [[Kelheim]] ramparts, were characteristic of oppida in central Europe. To the east, timbers were often used to support the earthen ramparts, called ''[[Pfostenschlitzmauer]]'' (post slot wall) or "[[Preist]]-type wall".&lt;ref name="Oppida"/&gt;{{rp|25}} In western Europe, especially Gaul, the ''[[murus gallicus]]'', a timber frame nailed together, was the dominant form of rampart construction. Dump ramparts, that is earth unsupported by timber, were common in Britain and were later adopted in France.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf (1993), pp.&amp;nbsp;225–226&lt;/ref&gt; They have been found in particular in the north-west and central regions of France and were combined with wide moats ("Type Fécamp").&lt;ref name="Oppida"/&gt;{{rp|25}} Oppida can be divided into two broad groups, those around the Mediterranean coast and those further inland. The latter group were larger, more varied, and spaced further apart.&lt;ref&gt;Collis (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;238&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain the oppidum of ''[[Camulodunon]]'' (modern [[Colchester]], built between the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD), tribal capital of the [[Trinovantes]] and at times the [[Catuvellauni]], made use of natural defences enhanced with earthworks to protect itself.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"&gt;Crummy, Philip (1997) City of Victory; the story of Colchester - Britain's first Roman town. Published by Colchester Archaeological Trust ({{ISBN|1 897719 04 3}})&lt;/ref&gt; The site was protected by two rivers on three of its sides, with the [[River Colne, Essex|River Colne]] bounding the site to the north and east, and the Roman River forming the southern boundary; the extensive bank and ditch earthworks topped with palisades were constructed to close off the open western gap between these two river valleys.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Denney, Patrick 2004"&gt;Denney, Patrick (2004) Colchester.

==History==
[[File:Bibracte Porte Rebout.jpg|thumb|left|The reconstructed walls of [[Bibracte]], France]]
Prehistoric Europe saw a growing population. According to Jane McIntosh, in about 5,000&amp;nbsp;BC during the Neolithic between 2 million and 5 million people lived in Europe;&lt;ref name="McIntosh"&gt;McIntosh (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;349&lt;/ref&gt; in the late (pre-Roman) Iron Age (2nd and 1st centuries BC) it had an estimated population of around 15 to 30 million.&lt;ref name="McIntosh" /&gt; Outside Greece and Italy, which were more densely populated, the vast majority of settlements in the Iron Age were small, with perhaps no more than 50&amp;nbsp;inhabitants. While hill forts could accommodate up to 1,000&amp;nbsp;people, oppida in the late Iron Age could reach as large as 10,000&amp;nbsp;inhabitants.&lt;ref name="McIntosh" /&gt;

Oppida originated in the 2nd and 1st centuries&amp;nbsp;BC. Most were built on fresh sites, usually on an elevated position. Such a location would have allowed the settlement to dominate nearby trade routes and may also have been important as a symbol of control of the area.&lt;ref name=McIntosh156/&gt; For instance at the oppidum of [[Ulaca]] in Spain the height of the ramparts is not uniform: those overlooking the valley are considerably higher than those facing towards the mountains in the area. The traditional explanation is that the smaller ramparts were unfinished because the region was invaded by the Romans; however, archaeologist [[John Collis]] dismisses this explanation because the inhabitants managed to build a second rampart extending the site by {{convert|20|ha}} to cover an area of {{convert|80|ha}}. Instead he believes the role of the ramparts as a status symbol may have been more important than their defensive qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Collis (2010), p.&amp;nbsp;31&lt;/ref&gt;

While some oppida grew from hill forts, by no means all of them had significant defensive functions. The development of oppida was a milestone in the [[urbanisation]] of the continent as they were the first large settlements north of the Alps that could genuinely be described as towns.&lt;ref name="Oppida"/&gt;{{rp|29}} Caesar pointed out that each [[List of peoples of Gaul|tribe of Gaul]] would have several oppida but that they were not all of equal importance, perhaps implying some form of [[settlement hierarchy]].

Oppida continued in use until the Romans began conquering Iron Age Europe. Even in the lands north of the [[River Danube]] that remained unconquered by the Romans, oppida were abandoned by the late 1st&amp;nbsp;century AD.&lt;ref name=McIntosh156/&gt; In conquered lands, the Romans used the infrastructure of the oppida to administer the empire, and many became full Roman towns. This often involved a change of location from the hilltop into the plain.

{{Wiktionary|patois}}
'''Patois''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|t|w|ɑː}}&lt;small&gt;, pl. same or&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|t|w|ɑː|z}})&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{OED|patois}}&lt;/ref&gt; is speech or language that is considered [[nonstandard dialect|nonstandard]], although the term is not formally defined in [[linguistics]]. As such, ''patois'' can refer to [[pidgin]]s, [[creole language|creoles]], [[dialect]]s, or [[vernacular]]s, but not commonly to [[jargon]] or [[slang]], which are vocabulary-based forms of [[Cant (language)|cant]].

In colloquial usage of the term, especially in [[France]], class distinctions are implied by the very meaning of the term, since in French, ''patois''  refers to any [[sociolect]] associated with uneducated rural classes, in contrast with the [[dominant language|dominant]] [[prestige language]] ([[Standard French]]) spoken by the middle and high classes of cities, or as used in literature and formal settings (the '[[acrolect]]').

==Etymology==
The term ''patois'' comes from [[Old French]], ''patois'' "local or regional dialect"&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt; (earlier "rough, clumsy, or uncultivated speech"), possibly from the verb ''patoier'', "to treat roughly", from ''pate'' "paw",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/patois|title=patois|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Old Dutch|Old Low Franconian]] *''patta'' paw, "sole of the foot" + ''-ois'', a pejorative suffix. The language sense may have arisen from the notion of a clumsy or rough manner of speaking.

==Examples==
In [[France]] and other [[Francophone]] countries, ''patois'' has been used to describe non-standard [[French language|French]] and  [[regional language|regional]] languages such as [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], since 1643, and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] after 1700, when the king [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] banned its use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/francophonie/Decret-interdiction-catalan1700.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The word assumes the view of such languages being backward, countrified, and unlettered, thus is considered by speakers of those languages as offensive when used by outsiders. [[Jean Jaurès]] said "one names ''patois'' the language of a defeated nation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rleb07.free.fr/opinions/vecteur.html A new "Common Vector", Robert L.E. Billon, April 2000, rleb07.free.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the [[vernacular]] forms of [[English language|English]] spoken in the [[Caribbean]] are also referred to as ''patois''. It is noted especially in reference to Jamaican Patois from 1934. [[Jamaican Patois]] language comprises words of the native languages of the many ethnic and cultural groups within the Caribbean including Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Amerindian, and English along with several African languages. Some islands have creole dialects influenced by their linguistic diversity; French, Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew, German, Dutch, Italian, Chinese, Vietnamese, and others. Patois are also spoken in  [[Costa Rica]] and Caribbean islands such as [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Barbados]] and [[Guyana]] in South America.

Often these patois are popularly considered '[[broken English]]', or slang, but cases such as Jamaican Patois are classified with more correctness as a [[creole language]]; in fact, in the [[French West Indies|Francophone Caribbean]] the analogous term for local basilectal languages is ''créole'' (see also [[Jamaican English]] and [[Jamaican Creole]]). [[Antillean creole]], spoken on several present or formerly French islands of the [[Lesser Antilles]], includes vocabulary and grammar of African and [[Carib language|Carib]] origin, in addition to French. It dialects often contain folk-etymological derivatives of French words, for example ''lavier'' ("river, stream") which is a syncopated variant of the standard French phrase ''la rivière'' ("the river") but has been identified by folk etymology with ''laver'', "to wash"; therefore ''lavier'' is interpreted to mean "a place to wash" (since such streams are often used for washing laundry).

Other examples of patois include [[Trasianka]], [[Sheng language|Sheng]], and [[Tsotsitaal]].
Patois has also been spoken for some [[Uruguay]] citizens, generally immigrants located in the south of Uruguay, mainly arriving from Italy and France, coming from [[Piedmont]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dedicaciontotal.udelar.edu.uy/adjuntos/produccion/742_academicas__academicaarchivo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synonyms==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
Dominican, Grenadian, St. Lucian, Trinidadian and Venezuelan speakers of [[Antillean Creole]] call the language ''patois''.  It is also named ''Patuá'' in the [[Paria Peninsula]] of [[Venezuela]], and spoken since the eighteenth century by self-colonization of French people (from [[Corsica]]) and Caribbean people (from [[Martinique]], Saint Thomas, [[Trinidad]], [[Guadeloupe]], Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic) who moved for [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]] production.

[[Macanese Patois]] is also known as ''Patuá'', and was originally spoken by the [[Macanese people|Macanese community]] of the former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony of [[Colony of Macau|Macau]].

'''Poetics''' is the theory of literary forms and literary [[discourse]]. It may refer specifically to the theory of [[poetry]], although some speakers use the term so broadly as to denote the concept of "theory" itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gérard Genette]] (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CWjjasIjWiYC&amp;pg=PA14 ''Essays In Aesthetics, Volume 4''], p.14: {{quotation|My program then was named "Theory of Literary Forms" — a title that I supposed to be less ambiguous for minds a little distant from this specialty, if it is one, than its (for me) synonym Poetics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "poetics" comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ποιητικός ''poietikos'' "pertaining to poetry," literally "creative, productive," from ποιητός ''poietos'' "made," verbal adjective of ποιεῖν ''poiein'' "to make."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=poetic "poetic"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar T.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;F. Brogan identifies&lt;ref name="Brogan"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brogan | first = T. | title = The New Princeton Handbook of Poetic Terms | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-691-03672-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; three major movements in Western poetics over the past 3,000 years, beginning with the [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]], [[Metaphysical objectivism|objectivist]] [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian tradition]] (see ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''). During the [[romanticism|romantic era]], poetics tended toward [[expressionism]] and emphasized the perceiving [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]. The 20th century witnessed a return to the Aristotelian paradigm, followed by trends toward metacriticality, or the establishment of a theory of poetics.

Eastern poetics developed primarily with reference to the [[lyric poetry|lyric]], as opposed to the [[mimesis|mimetic]].&lt;ref name="Brogan" /&gt;

==In literary criticism==

Poetics is distinguished from [[hermeneutics]] by its focus not on the meaning of a text, but rather its understanding of how a text's different elements come together and produce certain effects on the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Culler |first1=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Culler |year=1997 |title=Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction}}:&lt;/ref&gt; Most literary criticism combines poetics and hermeneutics in a single analysis; however, one or the other may predominate given the text and the aims of the one doing the reading.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2872">'''The Project on Scientific Knowledge and Public Policy (SKAPP)''', based at the [[George Washington University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], examines the nature of science and the ways in which it is both used and misused in government decision-making and legal proceedings. Through [[empirical research]], conversations among scholars, and publications, SKAPP aims to enhance understanding of how knowledge is generated and interpreted. SKAPP's mission is to promote transparent decision-making based on the best available science in order to promote public safety and health.

SKAPP provides information about the impacts of existing legislation and regulation on drug safety, [[occupational safety and health|occupational health and safety]], and [[environmental health]]. It has examined the use of science in regulation of specific hazards, including [[bisphenol A]], [[beryllium]], [[hexavalent chromium]], and the butter-flavoring chemical [[diacetyl]].

Support for SKAPP is provided by the George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services, the [[Open Society Institute]], and the Rockefeller Family Fund. Past support has been provided by the Common Benefit Trust, a fund established pursuant to a court order in the Silicone Gel Breast Implant Products Liability litigation; the Alice Hamilton Fund; and the [[Bauman Foundation]].

== Scientific evidence and the law ==
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] of the [[United States]] has issued three rulings which greatly impact the role scientists may play in providing [[expert testimony]]. These rulings are ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]],'' ''General Electric v. Joiner'', and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]].'' Each address the "[[gatekeeper]]" role of the judge in determining the admissibility of expert testimony, with considerable implications for [[tort]] litigation.

'''René Bazinet''' (born 1955)&lt;ref name = "LeBank" /&gt; is a German-Canadian clown, [[mime]], and stage and film actor. He is known for his work with [[Cirque du Soleil]], first as a performing artist touring extensively with   ''[[Saltimbanco]]'', and later as the clown act creator and acting consultant for the show as well as for Cirque du Soleil's 2011 production ''[[Zarkana]]''. He has also starred in shows at the [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre|Berlin Wintergarten]] and the [[Circus Roncalli]].

==Life and career==
Bazinet was born René Fiener (his mother's surname) in [[Bochum]], Germany. His father was Willy Dege, a cabaret and variety artist. When he was 14, his mother married a Canadian military police officer, Sgt. Major Bazinet, who adopted him, and the family emigrated to Canada. After completing high school in Montreal, Bazinet studied theatre at [[John Abbott College]] in Quebec. One of his teachers there, who had studied with [[Jacques Lecoq]], recognized Bazinet's talent for [[mime]] and devised a one-man show for him.&lt;ref name = "LeBank"&gt;LeBank, Ezra and Bridel, David (2015). [https://books.google.com/books?id=j4EGCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 ''Clowns: In Conversation with Modern Masters''], pp. 66–75. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "BZ1"&gt;''[[Berliner Zeitung]]'' (28 March 2003). [http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/der-alleskoenner-wintergarten-variet--ren--bazinet--conf-rencier-in--tandem---ist-schauspieler--saenger--pantomime-und-geraeuschvirtuose,10810590,10075816.html "Wintergarten Varieté: René Bazinet, Conférencier in ''Tandem'', ist Schauspieler, Sänger, Pantomime und Geräuschvirtuose"] ("Wintergarten Varieté: René Bazinet, Emcee in ''Tandem'', is an actor, singer, mime and sound virtuoso"). Retrieved 29 July 2015 {{icon de}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his teacher's recommendation he was accepted at the [[L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq|École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq]] and in 1978 left for Paris. There he was particularly influenced by the master clown [[Philippe Gaulier]]. It was through Gaulier that Bazinet made his first appearance in Germany, playing [[Harlequin]] in a 1980 Gaulier show at the {{ill|Frankfurter Autoren Theater|de}}. Jorge Zulueta and Jacobo Romano, the founders of Grupo Accion Instrumental, saw his Frankfurt performances and offered him a job writing and performing in their theatre productions for Paris, [[Graz]], and the [[Venice Biennale]]. When he left the Grupo Accion ensemble in 1982, he reconnected with Philippe Gaulier, who had opened his own school with the actress {{ill|Monika Pagneux|de}}. Bazinet did further studies in theatrical movement with Pagneux and worked as a street performer in Paris, often in the plaza of the [[Pompidou Center]].&lt;ref name = "LeBank" /&gt;

In a 1984 article on the Pompidou Center street performers for ''[[TDR (journal)|The Drama Review]]'', Kris Palmquist described Bazinet's miming as marked by a strong "inwardness" and noted,
&lt;blockquote&gt;René puts all his emphasis on the perfection of movement, precise and unusual body placement, and rhythmic timing. If everything goes correctly, his act is hypnotic.&lt;ref name = "Palmquist"&gt;Palmquist, Kris (Spring 1984). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1145565 "Street Performers at the Pompidou Center"]. ''[[The Drama Review]]'', Vol. 28, No. 1, pp. 97-102. Retrieved via [[Jstor]] 31 July 2015 {{subscription}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
During this period, Bazinet formed what was to be a life-long friendship with [[David Shiner (clown)|David Shiner]] who also worked as a street mime at the Pompidou. In 1988 Bazinet and Shiner (who by then was based in Munich) produced and performed a two-man show there and then took it on tour through Germany for a year and later to the rest of Europe.&lt;ref name = "LeBank" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "BZ1" /&gt;  The 1980s also saw Bazinet performing mime roles in several operas including [[Maurice Ohana]]'s '' La Célestine'' ([[Paris Opera]], 1988);&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].

Bazinet's association with [[Cirque du Soleil]] began in 1992 when he created and performed four roles in their premiere production of ''[[Saltimbanco]]''. He remained a cornerstone of the production for its first four years as it toured internationally.&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/07/arts/critic-s-notebook-balancing-love-and-death-at-the-circus.html|title=Critic's Notebook; Balancing Love and Death At the Circus|authorlink=Jon Pareles|first=Jon|last=Pareles|date=May 7, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'''s critic Christopher Meeks wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The funniest act on opening night was when clown Rene Bazinet, performing mime with self-produced sound effects, ensnared a denim-dressed man from the audience to join him. The man warmed to the clown's wordless mime lessons, and they enacted eating bananas, slipping on the peels, and, in inspired shenanigans, a shootout at high noon.&lt;ref&gt;Meeks, Christopher (12 October 1992).

'''Shiera Sanders Hall''' is the name of a fictional [[supporting character]] and later [[superheroine]] as '''[[Hawkgirl]]''' appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Shiera Sanders Hall was created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Dennis Neville]], and first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1 (January 1940) as a romantic interest of [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)]]. Then later as one of DC's earliest super-heroines, she has appeared in many of the company's flagship team-up titles including the [[Justice Society of America]]. 

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Dennis Neville]], Shiera Sanders first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1 (January 1940), in the same 12-page story in which Fox and Neville introduced [[Hawkman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/615/ ''Flash Comics'' #1] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]] has a dream that he is an ancient [[Egypt]]ian prince, Khufu, who has a lover, named Shiera in the original story, or Princess Chay-Ara in modern retellings. The next day, Carter meets a woman named Shiera, who looks exactly like the woman in his dream. Carter dons the identity of Hawkman and Shiera becomes Carter's girlfriend. Shiera first appears as Hawkgirl in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #5 (July 1941), in a costume created by [[Sheldon Moldoff]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/character/name/hawkgirl/sort/chrono/ Hawkgirl] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt; based on Neville's Hawkman costume. During Hawkman's solo segment of the [[Justice Society of America]] story, Shiera dons a spare set of [[Nth metal]] wings developed by Hawkman, and masquerades as Hawkman in order to trick some criminals. Shiera continues to wear the costume and wings in later stories, eventually adopting the identity of Hawkgirl.

With the establishment of DC's [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system, the Golden Age Hawkgirl was said to have lived on [[Earth-Two]] and the Silver Age Hawkgirl on [[Earth-One]]. Although Golden Age Hawkman makes his first Silver Age appearance during the first JLA/JSA teamup in 1963 and continues making appearances during the annual JLA/JSA teamups, Golden Age Hawkgirl does not reappear until 1976, in the revival of the ''All Star Comics'' monthly comic. During the publication gap between the cancellation of Hawkman at the end of the Golden Age and the reintroduction of Earth-Two Hawkman during the Silver Age, Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl are married off-panel. Golden Age Hawkgirl made further appearances as the mother of [[Hector Hall|Silver Scarab]] in the ''Infinity Inc.'' comic and as Hawkgirl as a member of the [[All-Star Squadron]], a retroactive team of Golden Age heroes active in the 1940s.

===Post-Crisis and One Year Later===
Following the events of DC's miniseries, ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the histories of Earth-One, Two, Four, S, and X were merged into one single Earth with a consistent past, present, and future. As a result, both the Golden Age and the Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl live on the same Earth. Shortly after ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', DC decided that having the Justice Society on the same Earth as all of the other superheroes was redundant and most of the team, including Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl were given a sendoff in the ''[[Last Days of the Justice Society of America|Last Days of the Justice Society]]'' [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]]. The Justice Society were trapped in another dimension, [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]], where they would battle for all of eternity to prevent [[Ragnarök]] from occurring on the Earth.

Shiera were resurrected after ''Blackest Night''.

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Shiera hall.jpg|thumb|Hawkgirl (Shiera Hall).&lt;br/&gt;Art by [[Ivan Reis]].]]
The [[reincarnation]] of the [[Egypt]]ian princess Chay-Ara, and partner of [[Carter Hall (comics)|Carter Hall]], the Golden Age Hawkman. Centuries ago, Chay-Ara and her lover Prince Khufu were killed by [[Hath-Set]] with a knife forged from [[Nth metal]]. The properties of the metal and the strength of the duo's love created a bond between them, causing them to be reborn multiple times throughout the centuries. Some of her incarnations are:

* Lady Celia Penbrook, alive during 5th century [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and love of [[Silent Knight]]
* [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]] (also known as Kate Manser), an [[American Old West|Old West]] gunslinger, and love of [[Nighthawk (DC Comics)|Nighthawk]]
* Sheila Carr, lady love of [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] detective James Wright

In the early 20th century, Chay-Ara was reborn as Shiera Sanders. She was kidnapped by Dr. Anton Hastor (reincarnation of Hath-Set), but subsequently rescued by Hawkman (her reborn lover Khufu). Shiera became the hero's frequent ally and love interest. Eventually, she was granted a costume of her own and a belt of gravity-defying Nth metal, and joined him at his side as Hawkgirl.

The Hawks were members of the [[All-Star Squadron]], and while Hawkman was a member of the [[Justice Society of America]], Hawkgirl was not, only assisting the group on occasion. Following the events of DC's miniseries, ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Shiera Hall joined the JSA. Eventually, Carter and Shiera married and had one son, [[Hector Hall]], the previous [[Doctor Fate]].

Through retcon, Carter and Shiera also joined the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] in the late 1980s, serving as liaisons between that group and the Justice Society.

Shiera died when she was merged with Carter and [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]] to form a new Hawkman version, a "hawk god" creature, during the events of ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'', but was revived during the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'' by the White Lantern ring.

===''DC Bombshells''===
In the ''[[DC Bombshells]]'' continuity set in World War II, Shiera is a technological genius and archaeologist who aids the Bombshells with her lover, [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]]. As Hawkgirl, she uses a jetpack rather than fly with wings, though when [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] forces her to build weapons out of ancient technology, she designs one with wings as well as a powerful mace.

Shiera grew up in an orphanage in Mexico. From a young age she had a passion for history and ancient cultures, as well as the magnificent structures that they built. She became an archaeologist and her work caught the eye of Hans Garber. He informed her of the Zambesi Amulets and the power that they possessed.&lt;ref&gt;http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Shiera_(DC_Bombshells)&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrigued, Shiera goes to [[Zambesi]] to try to discover the secret of the amulets. There she met [[Vixen (comics)|Queen Mari of Zambesi]] and the two of them fell in love. Shiera stayed in Zambesi with Mari and became her personal mechanic, building gadgets to assist Mari against her enemies.

Hawkgirl discovers her true [[Thanagarian]] origins while fighting against [[Baroness Paula von Gunther]]. After connecting herself with an ancient mechanic god it's revealed to Shiera that her parents were members of the [[Wingmen of Thanagar]], they sought to warn the humans upon the intentions of [[Thanagar]] who wished to conquer the Earth; due to their actions they were captured and murdered.&lt;ref&gt;''DC Bombshells'' #24 (June 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===
In the comic book adaptation of ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Hawkgirl (Shiera Hall) appears as a member of Superman's Regime. She first appears to answer [[Wonder Woman]]'s call for heroes at the Watchtower. After being informed of the situation, the kidnapping of Superman's parents at the hands of [[Mirror Master]], she is one of the many heroes to agree to help locate the Rogue. She battles [[Weather Wizard]] in Central City, and is later seen waiting outside the villain's bar. Hawkgirl next appears to help Wonder Woman battle the attacking Atlanteans and [[Aquaman]]. Hawkgirl battles the forces of Atlantis as Wonder Woman orders her to rescue the people who had been knocked off the boat by Aquaman's attack. She watches Arthur's forces suddenly retreat and notices the massive tsunami fast approaching. She is the first to realize there is something behind the wave. Hawkgirl spots what she believes are mountains rising out of the water, but are in fact the massive tentacles of the Kraken Aquaman called to his aid. Hawkgirl is ensnared by one of the Kraken's tentacles and dragged underwater, slowly drowning while Wonder Woman struggles to save her. After Superman arrives and forces Aquaman to call his beast off, Hawkgirl is ordered by the Man of Steel to help the sailors while Superman and the League go to give their response to Aquaman's ultimatum. Hawkgirl removes the leader of a country from his limousine during a parade before she loses him to [[Captain Atom]]. Shocked, Shiera lets her guard down and is struck by a blast of electricity, causing her to fall to the streets below.  Collapsed, Hawkgirl sees [[Black Lightning]] and [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] before the latter knocks her unconscious with an arrow bolt. Hawkgirl is later seen being held in a cell in the Batcave, glaring at Batman and Catwoman as they discuss the League's reaction to her kidnapping. When [[Catwoman]] points out the League will be searching for her, Batman disagrees and the scene cuts to the Watchtower, where to many heroes shock, a second Hawkgirl is seen arriving. The true Hawkgirl has remained trapped within the Batcave while her imposter has been revealed as the Martian Manhunter, shape-shifted into her form. Exactly a week later, the [[Martian Manhunter]] is exposed thanks to Batman's son Damian, and Bruce releases Hawkgirl as promised. Shiera makes her way to the crashed Watchtower and confirms her identity by easily putting out a lit match.

Hawkgirl goes to the Hall of Justice to question [[Lex Luthor]] over whether [[Sinestro]] truly willingly gave up his ring and powers before allowing himself to be imprisoned. Luthor confirms her questions before saying he still believes Sinestro has something else to play before Sinestro responds that the Green Lanterns will soon arrive to capture Superman and that the League will need his help to stop them.Hawkgirl is next seen waiting for Superman and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]] in Utah at the Great Salt desert, mace at the ready as she answers Shazam's question of what the Man of Steel thinks they're dealing with by replying "He thinks we're dealing with Green Lanterns." When Superman asks how she knows, she tells him she was talking with their 'guest' at the Hall of Justice. When she sees Superman staring up into the sky, she asks how many Lanterns are on the way, with Superman replying, "Too many."
After the Green Lanterns arrive in front of them and Superman and Kilowog have a brief conversation, Shiera demands to know where Hal Jordan is, and when Kilowog doesn't respond, Superman has Cyborg fire a beam down on the Green Lanterns from the Watchtower.
The Green Lanterns survive and engage the three, with Hawkgirl fighting the Green Lanterns Isamot Kol and RRU-9-2, when she sees Superman suddenly go down, calling out his name. Shortly after, Hawkgirl is defeated, her Nth Metal mace taken by Green Lantern Tomar-Re, and her unconscious body trapped in a bubble construct alongside Shazam. Before any of them can be taken to Oa, Sinestro arrives, killing [[Ch'p]]. Shiera is freed and recovers her mace before engaging Tomar-Re and Procanon Kaa in a battle until the arrival of the Sinestro Corps. Hawkgirl flies above the captured Green Lanterns, silently observing as they remove their rings in surrender and she witnesses the Sinestro Corps depart the Earth on Sinestro's orders. During the lost seven months, Hawkgirl worked alongside fellow League members Superman and Shazam as well as Lanterns Hal, John and Sinestro in toppling more 'rogue nations' to continue establishing peace across the world.

When [[Hawkman]] returns to [[Thanagar]] and does not find Hawkgirl he goes to Earth. There he tries to force Hawkgirl to leave Superman's Regime and return home, but, loyal to Superman, Shiera fights against Hawkman; after defeating him she asks him to leave or she will kill him. Not respecting her wish, Hawkman later returns to Earth and tries to kill Superman with a kryptonite mace; he fails and is killed in a fist fight against [[Superman]].

===''Bombshells: United''===
Hawkgirl appears as Shiera Hall in the continuation series to ''[[DC Comics Bombshells]]'', ''Bombshells: United'' set in the United States in 1943. Shiera is shown in [[Vixen (comics)|Zambesi]] alongside her lover, [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bombshells: United'' #11 (November 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkgirl is later featured fighting against the [[Apokolips]] invasion on [[DC Universe|Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bombshells: United'' #37 (May 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
In the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode, "[[Absolute Justice]]", Hawkgirl's weaponry and mask are on display at the JSA brownstone. Her hawk helmet has a crack across the right side, and Hawkman notes that she has been dead for several years. He confirms that she is his wife, Shayera Hall, and that both have been reincarnated many times through the ages. She is later featured in the second episode of the show's [[Smallville (season 10)|tenth and final season]], entitled "Shield". She appears in a brief flashback cameo while Carter Hall tells [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] about their past lives as [[Prince Khufu]] and Chay-Ara. She is portrayed by [[Sahar Biniaz]]. In the episode "Icarus", Carter Hall is killed while saving Lois from General [[Slade Wilson]] and a gas explosion in [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Oliver Queen]]'s office at the [[LuthorCorp]] building. Members of the show's nascent [[Justice League (Smallville)|Justice League]] lay Carter to rest in an Egyptian tomb alongside the body of Shayera. As with Carter's, Shayera's helmet and mace are placed on top of her casket in honor and respect.

[[File:Hawkgirl flying.jpeg|thumb|Hawkgirl in a promotional image for ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''.]]
Hawkgirl is a playable character in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]. She is seen with the rest of the [[Justice League]] battling villains on the "Prime" Earth. On the alternate Regime dominated Earth she is a member of the Regime. She and her world's [[Nightwing]] attack the "Prime" [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and the rest of the Joker Clan and is defeated. She later battles and is beaten by her world's [[Lex Luthor]], who takes her [[Nth metal]] belt as part of his plan to defeat Superman. After the Regime is defeated, she is captured and imprisoned along with the other former heroes. In her single-player ending, Hawkgirl is revealed to have been brainwashed by the Regime. Freed, she defeats Superman for having killed her husband Hawkman, but is imprisoned for her role in the Regime. One night, she is teleported to a stone of pure Nth Metal which encases her in invincible armor. She then sets out to exact revenge on those who helped [[Superman]] capture [[Hawkman]].

This Roman bronze sculpture ca. 1571–90 depicts a [[Siren (mythology)|siren]] from Greek mythology, believed to be an emblem of the [[Colonna family]], and first recorded in the collection of the Cardinal [[Francesco Maria del Monte]] before passing into the [[Barberini family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Siren|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/210103?sortBy=Relevance&amp;ft=siren&amp;offset=0&amp;rpp=20&amp;pos=1|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/The_Bronze_Siren_from_Del_Monte_and_Barberini_Collections_The_Metropolitan_Museum_Journal_v_46_2011|title="The Bronze Siren from the Del Monte and Barberini Collections": Metropolitan Museum Journal, v. 46 (2011) {{!}} MetPublications {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A female figure, nude from the waist up, boasts a crown and a multi-tentacled mermadic lower body.

[[File:Coat of Arms of Spain (1945-1977).svg|thumb|250px|[[Armorial achievement]] of Spain during the [[Francoist State]], consisting of the traditional escutcheon (arms of Castile, León, Aragon, Navarre and Granada) and the [[Pillars of Hercules]] with the motto ''Plus Ultra'', together with Francoist symbols: the motto «Una Grande Libre», the [[Eagle (heraldry)#Eagle of Saint John|Eagle of St. John]], and the yoke and arrows of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] which were also adopted by the Falangists.]]

The '''symbols of Francoism''' were iconic references to identify the [[Francoist State]] in [[Spain]] between 1936 and 1975. 
They serve as visual illustrations for the ideology of [[Francoist Spain]].   
Uniforms were designed for men and women that combined elements of the earlier [[Falangist]] and [[Carlist]] uniforms. 
The state developed new flags and escutcheons based on the traditional heraldry of the [[Spanish Monarchy|monarchy]], but now associated with the state.
The emblem of five arrows joined by a yoke was also adopted from earlier times, but after 1945 the arrows always pointed upward. 
This emblem appeared on buildings, plaques and uniforms.

Many statues of [[Francisco Franco]] were installed in public places, in part to lend legitimacy to his state.
Some towns, streets and plazas were given new names derived from Franco and his entourage.
Franco caused many monuments to be erected, some of them substantial buildings.
The most imposing is the ''[[Valle de los Caídos]]'', the Valley of the Fallen, incorporating a huge basilica built into the side of a mountain. War memorials and plaques commemorating those who had died in the [[Spanish Civil War]] were installed in many towns and villages.

After Franco's death in 1975, followed by the return to democracy, many symbols of Francoism were destroyed or removed and places renamed.
A law of October 2007 mandated removal of all remaining symbols from public buildings, 
with some exceptions for works of particular religious or artistic significance.

The [[Second Spanish Republic]] was established in April 1931 after King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] had forced the dictator General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] to resign,
followed by nationwide municipal elections.  The king and the former dictator fled the country when the republic was declared.
The new government inherited a bankrupt state.{{sfn|Ascunce|2012|p=74}}  
In an atmosphere of political unrest, opinions polarized between the extreme right and extreme left, often degenerating into violence.{{sfn|Horn|1996|p=54-56}}
On the right, the traditionalist [[Carlist]] movement revived.{{sfn|Payne|2000|p=160}}
In 1933, the aristocratic [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]], son of the former dictator, founded the far-right [[Falange]] movement, similar to the Italian [[Fascism|Fascists]].{{sfn|Payne|2000|p=69ff}}
In February 1934 the Falange merged with the ''[[Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]]'' (J.O.N.S), another right-wing group.{{sfn|Payne|2000|p=99}}
Left-wing trade unions staged industry-wide or citywide strikes, and in [[Catalonia]] Marxist and Anarchist groups competed for power.{{sfn|Horn|1996|p=54-56}} 
Landless laborers seized land, occupied estates and burned churches.{{sfn|Wells|2011|p=141}}{{sfn|Jelen|Wilcox|2002|p=79-80}}

At a time of political crisis, on 17 July 1936, General Francisco Franco led the Spanish colonial army from [[Morocco]] to attack the mainland, starting the [[Spanish Civil War]].
A bitter war of attrition, in which over 500,000 people died, dragged out until 1 April 1939, when the Nationalists led by Franco had acquired full control of the country.{{sfn|Sandler|2002|p=828}}
Franco was supported by the Falange and the Carlist ''Comunión Tradicionalista'', and united the two parties to forming the ''Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS'', or ''FET y de las JONS'', whose official ideology was the Falangists' 27 puntos. 
The new party was a wide-ranging nationalist coalition, closely controlled by Franco.{{sfn|Preston|1996|p=261-266}}

Franco had received material support in the civil war from both [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]], rulers of Germany and Italy, but when [[World War II]] broke out in September 1939, he cited the exhausted state of his country in maintaining a position of neutrality.{{sfn|Leitz|2000|p=118}}
In June 1940, Spain changed to a position of non-belligerency.
Despite pressure from [[Axis powers|Axis]] diplomats, that is as far as Franco would go.{{sfn|Leitz|2000|p=121ff}}
After the war ended in 1945, Franco remained dictator of Spain, at first isolated among the democracies of post-war Western Europe.
This isolation was gradually eroded by the pressures of the [[Cold War]], with Spain signing a security treaty with the United States in 1953.{{sfn|Ramet|Ingebritsen|2002|p=130}}
In the 1960s Spain experienced a boom from a growing tourism industry and from relaxation of trade barriers, 
modernizing economically and then culturally, which placed pressure on the state's highly conservative values.{{sfn|Sánchez|2007|p=19}}
However, Franco held onto power until his death in November 1975.
Soon after, a transition to democracy began.{{sfn|Greenberg|Katz|Wheatley|Oliviero|1993|p=292}}
A 1977 amnesty law was passed under which Franco's followers were given immunity for past abuses in return for supporting the transition.{{sfn|Tremlett|2007}}

==Uniforms==
[[File:JoseAntonioFEJONS.jpg|thumb|José Antonio Primo de Rivera in the Falange blue shirt]]
Photographs taken at the ceremony in October 1933 when the ''[[Falange Española de las JONS]]'' was founded do not show anyone wearing a uniform,
but a picture of a meeting of the ''Junta Política'' a year later shows some (but not all) members in the official uniform.  
This consisted of a dark blue shirt with epaulettes and long black trousers.  The left pocket of the shirt bore the emblem of the Falange.{{sfn|Ofer|2010|p=38}}
Women wore the blue shirt and a knee-length black skirt, with a leather belt bearing the Falange emblem on its buckle.{{sfn|Ofer|2010|p=39}} 
At a meeting in the [[Teatro Calderón (Valladolid)|Teatro Calderón]] in [[Valladolid]] in March 1934 the hall was filled with banners and insignia, and many attendees wore the blue shirts, visually displaying what [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]] called the "spirit of service and of sacrifice, the ascetic and military concept of life."{{sfn|Parkins|2002|p=167}} 
Later, upper-class women might use Falangist insignia on their clothes as fashion accessories. 
When Carmen Primo de Rivera, sister of José Antonio, married in December 1938 she had the yoke and arrows embroidered on her wedding dress.{{sfn|Parkins|2002|p=179}} 
After José Antonio died, a black tie was added in his memory.{{sfn|Wright|2008|p=66}}

After the union with the Carlists, the original Falange uniform became important in identifying genuine Falangists.{{sfn|Ofer|2010|p=39}} 
The red beret had become the symbol of carlism by the 1860s.{{sfn|Macclancy|2000|p=32}}

==Heraldic devices, symbols and icons==

[[File:Coat of Arms of Spain (1939-1945)-Bureaucratic Variant.svg|thumb|Copy of the model of the coat of arms called the "abridged" version for Franco's Spain. Approved in 1938, it was a simplified version of the coat of arms to promote bureaucratic aims. It was used on stamps, lottery tickets, identity documents, and buildings. A popular name for it was "coat of arms of the Eagle".{{sfn|Esparza Leibar|2006|p=231-274}}]]

===Flag===

At the time of the Pronunciamiento of 17 and 18 July 1936, the insurgent military forces used the national flag with their coat-of arms superimposed, that is to say, the current "tricolor" with the 1869 coat of arms, which had been approved by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1931]]. However, in the operations, especially in the air and naval combats, the insurgents soon experienced confusion in distinguishing their units from those of the government. Also, within the insurgent heterogenic political families, the [[Carlism|Carlists]] in [[Navarre]] insisted on going into combat with flags that were red and gold or white embroidered with red, known as the burgundy of San Andrés, and they included a wide variety of emblems with a mixture of symbols of the monarchy and religion, the latter being particularly directed to the worship of the "Sacred Heart".{{sfn|Peña López|Alonso González|2004|p=17}}{{sfn|Esparza Leibar|2006|p=231-274}}

The government aimed to resolve this flag situation with the Decree of 29 August 1936, signed by General [[Miguel Cabanellas]], which reinstated the red and yellow flag. 
There was no reference to the dimensions nor the coat of arms, so the insurgent forces employed a host of distinctive coats of arms. 
To settle this situation, the Junta added an order to the Decree on 13 September 1936, signed by Colonel Federico Montaner. 
This defined the shapes and dimensions of the Army's flags to be the same as before the proclamation of the Republic.
The coat of  arms was that of the Republic. 
Eventually, considering the aims of the Falange, a new design for the coat of arms was formally specified and regulated by Decree number 470, 2 February 1938, signed by General Franco.{{sfn|Peña López|Alonso González|2004|p=17}}{{sfn|Esparza Leibar|2006|p=231-274}}

===Escutcheon===

The escutcheon, popularly known the  "Eagle escutcheon", and then representative of the insurgent group and its ideology,  was imposed after the conflict as the national escutcheon for [[Spain]]. It included some minor technical improvements which were approved in 1945, during the period of the Francoist State itself  and also during the period of democratic transition until 1981. Certain symbolic value changes were approved in 1977, such as making the eagle's wings much more open.{{sfn|Historia de la Bandera de España}}

By the express directive of the Franco government, the design of the shield for the national emblem represented a departure from the traditional one that had been used in its various forms since 1868. After this  change,  the escutcheon of [[Spain]] was attached to the State  and not the Monarchy.  Without affecting  the basic design, the shield was divided into four with the coats of arms of [[Castile and León|Castille]], [[Province of León|León]], [[Aragon]] and [[Navarre]], plus the «enté en point» of [[Granada]]. The inclusion of other historical heraldic elements gave a clear symbolic significance: "The set of arrows and the yoke of the Catholic Monarchs, whose adoption as a badge is one of the great successes of our Falange, must appear on the official arms to indicate what should be the tone of the New State."{{sfn|Luengo|2012|p=19}}

The Eagle on [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s escutcheon had already been used on the arms of the [[Catholic Monarchs]]. 
It was the [[Eagle (heraldry)#Eagle of Saint John|Eagle of Saint John the Evangelist]], which Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] used on an evangelist escutcheon to which she added the words ''sub umbra alarum tuarum protege nos'' (protect us under the shadow of your wings).{{sfn|V Centenario Isabel I de Castilla}}
The heraldry  used by Franco  was similar to that of the  Catholic Monarchs, the arms of [[Aragon]]-[[Sicily]] replaced by those of the Navarre, the addition of the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and the motto One, Great and Free''.{{sfn|The coat of arms}}

=== Origin of the Yoke, arrows and Gordian knot ===
[[File:Losar emblemas 20071021.jpg|thumb|Emblems of the Catholic Monarchs on the facade of the Church of Santiago ([[Losar de la Vera]], Cáceres), c. 1500.]]

In Spanish heraldic tradition, the yoke, set of arrows and the [[Gordian Knot]],  were elements which were joined with the leaves and the pomegranate and the motto ''[[Tanto monta, monta tanto, Isabel como Fernando|Tanto monta, monta tanto]]'' (Equal opposites in balance), the personal motto and prenuptial agreement of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], as embodied  in the song of  Pedro Marcuello.{{sfn|Marcuello|1987}}{{sfn|Menéndez Pidal|2004|p=204}}
This motto was used upon the weapons of both Monarchs from 1475. 
They made an agreement, now called ''Concordia de Segovia'' and the coat of arms is a graphic representation of this pact which united the two most important Monarchs on the peninsula.  It is the oldest known image of the escutcheon.{{sfn|Menéndez Pidal|2004|p=211}}

The bundle of arrows may have its origins in the Roman ''fasces'', a bundle of rods and an axe with the blade projecting, that were carried before the magistrates to show their power.  The arrows pointed downward to show they were ready for use in executing criminals or for warfare.{{sfn|Cruz|Suzuki|2009|p=54}}
With the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella, the bundle of arrows meant the union of Castile and Aragon to create Spain.  The yoke was Isabel's and the arrows Ferdinand's.
The F was the first letter of Fernando's name, and the Y the first letter of Isabella's.
The [[Gordian knot]], cut, united the two.{{sfn|Fernández|Porto|Celada|2004|p=73}} 
The number of arrows varied, but always pointed downwards. Over time, the badge of the Catholic Monarchs spread to other heraldic compositions, and was adopted in some of its variants as the emblems of not only towns and cities such [[Ronda]], [[Marbella]] and [[Málaga]], but also [[Puerto Rico]] and the  [[Netherlands]].{{sfn|Menéndez Pidal|2004|p=345}}

=== Emblem of the Falange ===

[[File:Yugo-y-flechas.jpg|thumb|Sign on public housing built during the Francoist State ( Madrid, 2007). The official single party used its association with the National Movement, and with it the FET-JONS, to try to carry out National Syndicalists measures, although these had little effect.]]
The adoption of this symbol was explained by a professor at the [[University of Granada]], [[Fernando de los Ríos]], who had socialist leanings. In  a class on political law  of the [[Fascism|Fascist]] state and its symbols, he made a drawing on the blackboard of a set of arrows linked with a yoke, indicating that this would be the symbol of Fascism and to have been born or raised in [[Spain]].  He said that if ever there was a Spanish fascism, this would be the emblem."''{{sfn|Cinco siglos de yugo y flechas}}
Juan Aparicio López,, a student attending the class, suggested adoption of this symbol for JONS of [[Onésimo Redondo]] and [[Ramiro Ledesma Ramos]] ([[Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]]). He also proposed the 'red and black' and the motto "Spain: one, great and free".{{sfn|Juan Aparicio López}}
The J.O.N.S adopted the [[yoke and arrows]] symbol, which immediately became popular due to its geometrical simplicity, warlike symbolism and invocation of a time when Spain was glorious.{{sfn|Ramos|1988|p=70}}
The symbol was adopted by the Falange at the time of the merger on 13 February 1934.{{sfn|Irasuegui|2010|p=117}}
The yoke and arrows represented the union of the five kingdoms of Castile, Leon, Aragon, Granada and Navarre, 
and both national unity and the glories of the period of Ferdinand and Isabella were persistent themes of Franco's Spain.{{sfn|Teichova|Matis|2003|p=125}}

The poet and activist [[Rafael Sánchez Mazas]] wrote, in an edition of the magazine ''El Fascio''1933 the reasons for the Spanish Falange's adoption  of some aspects of those used by  the Catholic Monarchs was because of their origin in the works of the Roman poet [[Virgil]] (70 BC – 19 BC). The symbolism of the arrows, as an expression of war was used in Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'', and the yoke, a symbol for agricultural, was based in Virgil's poem, the [[Georgics]], and was meant to provide a falangist symbolism:
''... We integrate  the yoke and the set of arrows into the escutcheon. If the yoke without the arrows is heavy, the arrows without the yoke are in danger of becoming too scattered. We are changing, rather than to a policy, to a discipline, to a behavior, to a style, to a way of being, to an education.''{{sfn|Haz y Yugo}}
Those responsible for the Falange ideology, such as José Antonio Primo de Rivera, Juan Aparicio, [[Ernesto Giménez Caballero]], [[Ramiro Ledesma]], Orbegozo, wrote in the journal ''Fascio'' that the chosen emblem was also close to Italian Fascism.{{sfn|El Fascio Index 1933}}

=== Víctor ===

[[File:Vítor (Symbol).svg|thumb|Detail of the"víctor". It contains each one of the letters in the word victor.]]
The "victor" is a symbol from the Ancient Roman Empire.
After the Edict of Milan in the year 313 AD, the ''crismón'' appeared on coins, flags and eventually also became part of the shields of the Roman legionaries. 
According to legend, the night before the battle of the [[Ponte Milvio]], the ''crismón''  with the words ''in hoc signo vinces'' (In this sign, you conquer') appeared to Emperor [[Constantine the Great]] in his dreams. The next day the Emperor replaced the Imperial eagle by the ''crismón'' on the standard, the ''[[labarum]]'', and he won the battle.
Over time, it was gradually included, in varying forms, on the Roman crowns. It had become the symbol of the victor and the victorious.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
From the fourteenth century, it was adopted as the emblem for doctors by some Spanish universities, such as the [[University of Salamanca]] and later [[Alcalá de Henares]], and is in mural inscriptions done in red or black paint that remain there today. Finally, it was chosen as suitable for use in the ''Victory Parade''  (July 18, 1939) and, thereafter, throughout the Franco dictatorship, as emblem of Franco.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
Mistakenly  it was thought it had been designed by Corintio Haza, who incorporated astrological symbols in the emblem to protect the ''Caudillo''.{{sfn|Constantino I}}

=== Guidon, head of State's standard and coat of arms of Franco ===
[[File:Coat of Arms of Francisco Franco as Head of the Spanish State.svg|thumb|The personal coat of arms of Franco.]]

The [[Colours, standards and guidons#Spain|guidon]], the personal military flag, and a [[Royal standard|head of State's standard]] were created in 1940 and then used until the death of the dictator. The stripe between the two dragons separates the two [[Pillars of Hercules]] which have silver columns, gold Corinthian capitals and are headed with crowns. The crown nearest to the stripe, which is always on the column placed on the lower part of the flag, is an [[Imperial crown]] with a central upright bar. The one on the other column is a Royal crown, this has a more open top and it is always on the column placed on the top half of the flag.{{sfn|Morales|Alegría|2001}}
The [[Royal Bend of Castile]], which was a personal badge of the Castilian Monarchs and later used by the [[House of Habsburg]], was used as the basis  for the creation of the escutcheon. 
The standard, the flag which was flown at official residences, barracks and on ships of the [[Spanish Navy]], was a square with the elements mentioned above.{{sfn|Morales|Alegría|2001}}
''La Banda de Castilla'' and the Columns of Hercules form part of the personal escuteon used by Franco as Chief of State. The coat of arms also contained the [[Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand]]  as [[supporter]] and  an open crown without [[Half-arch (crown)|arches]] known as the crown of military leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Super-libris of Franco, Francisco (1892-1975)|work=Ex-libris Database|editor= Royal Library (Madrid)|url=http://encuadernacion.realbiblioteca.es/index.php?p=searchexlibris&amp;t=identificacion&amp;i=80|accessdate=2013-05-06|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statues of Franco ==
[[File:Convent Sant Doménec Franco.jpg|thumb|Equestrian statue in Valencia]]
[[File:Francoayto.jpg|thumb|The last equestrian statue of Franco. Removed from the town centre of [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], 18 December 2008.]]
[[File:Las huellas de Franco, Ceuta (2).jpg|thumb|"Franco's Footprints", part of the monument to the Victoria Convoy, in Ceuta. The footprints were filled with concrete in February 2010.]]

The statues are varied sculptural representations of the dictator: busts, equestrian statues, etc., which the state placed in many Spanish cities. The purpose of having so many statues has changed over time.  It has been suggested that up to 1959 (and especially in the 1940s) the purpose of the many statues was to legitimize the state  and "perpetuate the memory of victory". It has been further suggested that in the 1960s  these were a special tribute  to show "appreciation of Franco and his achievements" (in a spirit of commemorating  the 25 Years of Peace). In the last period (after the death of Franco until 1978) the statues were to "secure the memory" of an "unchanging goal.{{sfn|Andrés|2006|pp=11-12}}

The most important equestrian statues were placed in prominent places in [[Valencia]], [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] and the ''Nuevos Ministerios''  in Madrid. The original was designed in 1959 by [[José Capuz Mamano]].{{sfn|Irigoyen de la Rasilla|2001|p=41}}
This statue is at the [[Complutense University]] in Madrid, with other copies in Barcelona,{{sfn|Ollés|2008}} Zaragoza (1948),{{sfn|Defensa ... Zaragoza}} Melilla,{{sfn|Retiran de Melilla la última estatua}} Ferrol,{{sfn|La última estatua ecuestre...}}{{sfn|IU quiere ver fundida...}} and the Institute of Maeztu Ramiro in Madrid (1942, a smaller one than the original and moved to the Infantry Academy in Toledo in the 1980s to the Infantry Academy in Toledo.{{sfn|La Academia de Infanteria}}

Places where statues can currently be found:
* [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]]: a statue of over six metres high, at Franco's birthplace. Originally placed in la Plaza de España, it is now in the Museo Naval de Herrerías, inside the military naval dockyard.
* [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]: on the side of the main facade of the Infantry Academy in Toledo.
* [[Valencia]]: an equestrian statue of the dictator which was  withdrawn from Valencia in 1983 and is  now preserved in the courtyard of the convent of Santo Domingo.
* [[Melilla]]: retains the only statue of Franco that can be seen standing on a public road and, after being withdrawn in 2005 due to road works that were to take place, was placed back about 50 meters from its previous location. This statue was made before Franco became the Head of State and celebrates his achievements in the War of Africa.
* [[Tenerife]]: in the town of [[El Rosario, Tenerife|El Rosario]], there is plinth with Franco's bust, which records that in June 1936 the then commanding General of the Canary Islands (Franco) met there with officers of the garrison to prepare for the uprising.
* [[La Coruña]]: in various parts of the city, there are sculptures and plaques, with the image of the dictator on horseback surrounded by the Moorish guard of the Palace of Maria Pita.
* [[Oviedo]]: next to San Francisco Park and within the complex of buildings belonging to the Civil Government of [[Asturias]], a bronze statue of Franco on the side facing the park.

== Monuments ==

===War memorials and Plaques to "Those Fallen for God and for Spain." ===

'''War memorials''' and '''plaques''' for those "Fallen for God and Spain" were placed in many villages, most on the outside of the churches. They contained a list of names of the dead people belonging to the Spanish Nationalist party followed by the declaration 'Present!' similar to that of José Antonio Primo de Rivera. The plaques, although there were many kinds, were usually made of marble and topped with bronze or other metal. Sometimes the plaques were placed on the walls of the church, or if there was a wall nearby, at the burial place of the victims named on the plaque. If there was a cross-shaped monument or low obelisk that recorded the names, a plaque was attached to it. Many places have now chosen to move this type of monument to the cemeteries, and in some cases they have been turned into tributes to the "fallen" from both sides.
There was another use of plaques, this was  at the opening of institutions and infrastructure such as railway lines, stations, reservoirs, etc., These plaques still exist today.
Many of the plaques and monuments are neither maintained nor withdrawn.

=== The Victory Arch ===

[[File:Madrid - Moncloa - Arco de la Victoria - 20050220.jpg|thumb|Victory Arch ([[Madrid]]).]]
The Victory Arch of Madrid (''Arco de la Victoria de Madrid'') is situated in the [[Moncloa-Aravaca]] district of Madrid. 
The monument was built between 1953 and 1956 by order of Franco to commemorate his victory in the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Baskett|2003|p=133}} 
The {{convert|40|m}} high arch commemorates the nationalist victory in the [[Battle of Ciudad Universitaria]], in which the [[University City of Madrid|University City]] was destroyed. Inscriptions in Latin describe the victory and the construction of the new University City.{{sfn|Victory arch}}
Behind it is the monument to the Fallen from Madrid, designed in 1949 by the architect [[Manuel Herrero de Palacios]], a monumental circular building roofed with a cupola.
Today it is the home of the municipal council of the Moncloa - Aravaca district.{{sfn|Álvarez-Fernández|2007|p=61}}

=== Monument to the Fallen in Pamplona ===

[[File:Caídosfront.JPG|thumb|Monument to the Fallen in [[Pamplona]] ([[Spain]]).]]

Popularly known as the Monument to the Fallen, the real name is ''Navarra a sus Muertos en la Cruzada'' (Navarre to its Dead in the Crusade), as indicated on its facade.
The building was erected in memory of the dead from Navarre, a Nationalist stronghold during the Civil War, and is located in the heart of the city of [[Pamplona]], the capital of [[Navarre]]. The building was designed by the architects Victor Eusa and José Yamoz.
The names of the 5,000 people of Navarre who died in combat in the civil war were inscribed on its walls,
but today they are covered by a sheet.{{sfn|Corpas Mauleón|2012|p=54}}
Today the building is known as the ''Sala de Exposiciones Conde Rodezno'' (Conde Rodezno Exhibition Hall) and is used for small municipal exhibitions.{{sfn|Sala de Exposiciones Municipal Conde Rodezno}}

=== Headquarters, Cuartel de La Montaña ===
[[File:Parque de la Montaña.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque.]]

The Cuartel de la Montaña was a military building in Madrid that achieved notoriety as the place where the military uprising of July 1936 began in the city.
On July 19, 1936 in Madrid, General Fanjul, without a commission, but charged with the uprising of the city, came in civilian clothes, to  the headquarters, Cuartel de La Montaña. Instead of going out with troops to take the vital points of the capital, he simply proclaimed the state of war and became powerful with 1,500 men (of whom there were about 140 officers) and approximately 180 Falangists from the Cuartel de La Montaña.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

That afternoon, the base was surrounded by poorly armed troops loyal to the government of the Republic Assault Guards, civilians and militia. At dawn on 20 July, shelling of the barracks began. The rebels resisted for only a few hours. Differences of opinion amongst themselves,  led some rebels to fly the white flag while others were firing on the attackers. The garrison fell, being almost completely destroyed. The entry of the attacking forces resulted in the murder of most of the officers (ninety of one hundred forty) and the Falangists. There were between 150 and 300 dead.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The building, which had been mostly destroyed during the siege, during the war suffered the impact of numerous artillery attacks because of its proximity to the front line, which to all intents and purposes stayed in the same place since early 1937. Towards the end of the war it was just a set of ruins, some of which could still be seen in the early sixties.
The park, Parque del Cuartel de la Montaña,  was inaugurated on 20 July 1972, when Franco was still in power and [[Carlos Arias Navarro]], the future prime minister, was mayor of Madrid. It incorporates  a monument, also from 1972, by Joaquín Vaquero Turcios in memory of those who died in its defence. This consists of a bronze figure representing the body of an injured man at the centre of a wall sculpted in the form of sandbags.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== The ruins of Belchite ===

[[File:Belchite - Vista general01.JPG|thumb|The Ruins of Belchite.]]
The Battle of Belchite occurred during the Republican offensive in Aragon that started in August 1937, with Zaragoza as the target.  For various reasons, including heat, lack of water and the military superiority of the Nationalists, the offensive was unsuccessful.  Starting on 1 September 1937, the republicans concentrated on Belchite, with an intense artillery bombardment combined with aerial bombing.  The town was totally ruined and 6,000 people had died when the defenders surrendered on 6 September 1937.  Although the outcome was a Republican victory, the delay caused by the battle gave the Nationalists time to regroup and prevent the advance to Zaragoza.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=102}}

Franco decreed that the original town be left in its state of ruin as a monument.{{sfn|Ward|2004|p=202}}
Republican prisoners were made to build a new town of Belchite, but the original town has not been rebuilt.
The ruins remain as a monument that attracts small numbers of battlefield tourists each year.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=106}}

=== Monuments for the Battle of Ebro ===
[[File:Poble Vell (Corbera d'Ebre) 1.jpg|thumb|Ruin of Corbera de Ebro.]]

The bloodiest battle of the Civil War was fought on the left bank of the river [[Ebro]].

* In memory of General Franco's victory, the town of [[Corbera de Ebro]] was left just as it had been after the battle.
* At an elevation of 427 metres at [[Quatre Camins]] a stone cross stands in memory of the Third Requetes of Our Lady of Montserrat, the Carlist Nationalist unit formed by Catalan volunteers, which suffered heavy casualties in this place. St. Andrew's Cross of red stands on the pedestal.
* At elevation 481 in [[Punta Targa]], a monument stands for the brotherhood of the Third Requetes of Our Lady of Montserrat. The base of the monument is an [[ossuary]] containing the remains of combatants from both sides.
* At the crossroads for Faterella and [[Villalba de los Alcores]] there  is a monolith erected in memory of the soldiers of the 4th Division of Navarre who died in on the banks of the Ebro.
* At [[Coll del Moro]], on the outskirts of [[Gandesa]], a monolith from 1953 marks the position from which Franco personally led the final attack. The monument has been vandalized with graffiti both for and against Franco's Spain.
* On one of the peaks of [[Puig de l'Àliga]] near [[Gandesa]], there is another monument but the original inscription has been lost over time.
* In [[Prat de Compte]] in front of the school there is a cross in memory of the 'Fallen for God and for Spain'.

=== Monument for the Massacre of Paracuellos ===
[[File:20070519 - Vista del cementerio de Paracuellos.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Paracuellos de Jarama|Paracuellos]] Cemetery. In the background is the white cross drawn on the hill where the killings took place.]] 
Republican Militia guards killed over a thousand prisoners in the "[[Paracuellos massacres|Massacre of Paracuellos]]", during the [[Battle of Madrid]], in the area around San Jose, in the municipality of [[Paracuellos de Jarama]], and Soto Aldovea, within the boundary of [[Torrejón de Ardoz]].  They are commemorated by a large white cross on the slopes of the Cerro de San Miguel, near the river [[Jarama]] and visible from the airport of Madrid-Barajas.{{sfn|Plano del Camposanto de Paracuellos}}

=== The Fortress at Toledo ===
{{main|Alcázar of Toledo}}
[[File:Alcazar de Toledo.jpg|thumb|'''El Alcázar''', Toledo, a fortress built out of rock, is  located in the upper part of the city of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and  it overlooks the city.]]

In the third century the Alcázar of Toledo was a Roman palace. It was restored during the reigns of Alfonso VI and Alfonso X and modified in 1535.
During the Civil War it was used by Colonel [[José Moscardó Ituarte]] as a defence building and a place of resistance. During a siege there, which lasted 70 days, from 22 July to 28 September 28, 1936, it was completely destroyed by troops loyal to the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. 
Later it was rebuilt.
Since 1998 it has housed the Library of [[Castile-La Mancha]], and from 2010 it has also held the Army Museum.
The siege and liberation were used by Francisco Franco to establish his dominance with his followers.
The newspaper ''Ultra'' named the building ''El Alcázar'' of Spain, although at first was a daily that referred to it as an historical landmark.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== Monument to the cruiser "Baleares" ===

The Monument to the cruiser "Baleares" (''El Monumento al Crucero «Baleares»'') is located in the San Feixina Park, [[Palma, Majorca]].
It is controversial, with some groups calling for its removal.{{sfn|Oliver|2009}}
The monument was erected in memory of the crew of the [[Spanish cruiser Baleares]], which was torpedoed and sunk by destroyers of the [[Spanish Republican Navy]] in the [[Battle of Cape Palos]].  The monument was designed by the architects Don Francisco and Don José Roca Simó (father and son) and the sculptor José Ortells Cabanellas. It was inaugurated on 16 May 1947.  The column is {{convert|22|m}} high, topped by a huge cross.  At one time it also had a sculpture of a sailor clinging to an anchor.{{sfn|Fullana|ConolloyCota|2000}}

== Religious monuments ==

Franco was raised as a devout Catholic, and came to believe that Spanish nationalism and Catholic belief could not be separated.  He felt that Spain had a special religious mission, and completely identified his cause with the cause of the church.{{sfn|Payne|2011|p=199}}
Franco called his fight against the Republicans a "crusade" and presented his 1939 victory as a victory of [[Christian civilization]].{{sfn|Conway|Romijn|2008|p=150}}
When attending churches, he entered solemnly under a religious canopy.{{sfn|Soler|2005}}
On 15 April 1938, [[Vinaròs]] beach was captured, splitting the Republican-held area into two.
The head of the Navarre IV Division dipped his fingers in the water and made the sign of the cross, symbolically taking possession.{{sfn|Cardona|2012}}

St Teresa was designated by traditionalists and the Catholic Church as the "saint of the Spanish race". The Nationalist forces found a relic of the saint in Málaga, one of her hands, which was sent to Franco. He made a personal cult of devotion to the saint, keeping the relic in his home until he died.{{sfn|Pérez-Romero|1996|p=68}}

=== The Valley of the Fallen ===
[[File:SPA-2014-San Lorenzo de El Escorial-Valley of the Fallen (Valle de los Caídos).jpg|thumb|The Valley of the Fallen.]]
{{Main|Valle de los Caídos}}
This monument to the fallen in the civil war was built by Republican prisoners of war.
It is on a huge scale, with the basilica built into the side of a pine-covered mountain, 
with an enormous stone cross above the entrance.{{sfn|Simonis|2007|p=168-169}}   
The stone cross is {{convert|500|ft}} high and is visible from a distance of {{convert|30|mi}}.{{sfn|Encarnación|p=1}}
The monument and basilica were built in accordance with the Decree of 1 April 1940 providing for construction of a Basilica, monastery and youth headquarters, in a farm located on the slopes of the Sierra de Guadarrama (El Escorial), "to perpetuate the memory of the fallen of our glorious Crusade".{{sfn|Los comienzos del Valle de los Caidos}}
Construction began in the 1940s and the structure was completed in 1959.{{sfn|Encarnación|p=1}}

Franco's grave is beside the altar.
The monument is still visited by the dwindling group of his die-hard supporters on the anniversary of Franco's death.{{sfn|Simonis|2007|p=168-169}} 
José Antonio Primo de Rivera and many other combatants from both sides in the Spanish Civil War are buried in the valley.{{sfn|Olmeda|2010}}
Perhaps 50,000 of Franco's supporters are buried there, along with a handful of Republicans.{{sfn|Encarnación|p=1}}
Human rights groups have called for ''El Valle de los Caidos'' to be converted into a center that would teach visitors about the civil war and the Francoist State.
Others have asked that the bodies of Jose Antonio and Franco be removed, 
and that plaques or other methods be used to give visitors some understanding of the historical background.{{sfn|Encarnación|p=147}}

=== Sacred Heart of Jesus ===
[[File:Cerro-angeles1.jpg|thumb|Monument, the Sacred Heart of Jesus in [[Cerro de los Ángeles]], [[Getafe]], Spain.]]
{{Main|Cerro de los Ángeles}}
The ''Cerro de los Ángeles'' (Hill of the Angels) is the site of the ''Monumento al Sagrado Corazón'' (Monument of the Sacred Heart).
The original monument was created by the architect Carlos Maura Nadal and the sculptor  Aniceto Marinas y García, and was inaugurated by King Alfonso XIII on 30 May 1919.
It was destroyed on 7 August 1936 during the civil war.{{sfn|Monumento Antiguo}}
The Republicans dynamited the monument due to its religious and political symbolism.  
There was a proposal to replace it with a figure representing Liberty or the Republic, but this was not executed.{{sfn|González Martínez|1999|p=182}}

The current monument is similar in design to the 1919 monument, but on a larger scale.  
Construction began in 1944 to designs by the architects Pedro Muguruza and Luis Quijada Martínez.
The monument shows Christ with open arms, inviting all men to come to Him.  
The {{convert|11.5|m}} high statue on a {{convert|26|m}} pedestal is the work of Aniceto Marinas, and the group of sculptures around the base is by Fernando Cruz Solís.
The monument was opened in 1965.  The crypt, which did not exist in the original monument, was opened in 1975.{{sfn|El Monumento al Sagrado Corazón}}

== Place names ==
[[File:Alberche del Caudillo.jpg|thumb|Alberche del Caudillo, now [[Calera y Chozas]] in the [[Province of Toledo]]]]

===Towns and villages===
{{see also|Instituto Nacional de Colonización}}
Today, there are a dozen towns that preserve the memory of Franco in their official names. The only one which has the status of a municipality is [[Llanos del Caudillo]], with  726 inhabitants. Many other towns and cities that had similar names for decades, such as [[Ferrol, Galicia|El Ferrol del Caudillo]] (until 1982, in the province of La Coruña), or [[Barbate|Barbate de Franco]] (until 1998, in the province of [[Cadiz]]), withdrew the reference to Franco after the restoration of democracy. Franco wanted to honour generals from the Nationalist side by putting their names to various locations, and they still retain these. Such is the case of [[San Leonardo de Yagüe]], where [[Juan Yagüe|General Juan Yagüe]] was born, or [[Alcocero de Mola]], where [[Emilio Mola|General Emilio Mola]] died in a plane crash during the war.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
The case of [[Numancia de la Sagra]] ([[Province of Toledo|Toledo]]) is an example. Since the [[Middle Ages]] this town was known as ''Azaña'', but during the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] this coincided with the first name of the then Spanish Prime Minister, [[Manuel Azaña]], so it was replaced in 1936. The original name, Azana means ''wheel'' (Arab-Moorish word). The town is now called "Numancia", after the regiment  which captured it and "Sagra" for the region it belongs to.{{sfn|Villena Garcia|2010|p=277}}

=== Street names ===
[[File:Plaque generalisimo.jpg|thumb|Nameplate for la Avenida del Generalísimo.]]

The memory of Franco is still present in the names of the streets, squares and avenues of various towns and cities. There are also streets, avenues and squares in many cities and towns in Spain with names of generals from during the Civil War and the Nationalist party, military commanders such as [[Emilio Mola|Mola]], [[José Sanjurjo|Sanjurjo]], [[José Moscardó Ituarte|Moscardó]], [[Juan Yagüe|Yagüe]] and [[José Millán Astray|Millán Astray]]. Other names from the Franco time were used, such as José Antonio Primo de Rivera, [[Ramiro Ledesma Ramos|Ramiro Ledesma]], [[Onésimo Redondo]], [[José Calvo Sotelo]], etc.. Those that did not have a personal relationship with Franco, were those who had died before or during the war; José Antonio Primo de Rivera, who was imprisoned, opposed the National Uprising and become part of the earlier conspiracy.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Removal of symbols==

In January 1980 the Madrid city council decided to rename twenty downtown streets, returning them to the names they had before 14 April 1931, when the Second Republic was created.  The Avenida del Generalísimo, which had been created since that date, became the [[Paseo de la Castellana]].{{sfn|Lafuente|1980}}
In 1981 the Avenida de José Antonio in Madrid was renamed ''La Gran Vía''.{{sfn|La Gran Vía, Madrid}}
But despite the withdrawal of some of the symbols during the first years of the Transition, some symbols remained more than thirty years after his death.

The Spanish [[Historical Memory Law]], approved by the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]] on 31 October 2007, mandated the removal of commemorative plaques, statues and other symbols from public buildings.  It also opened the public archives covering the period and facilitated the task of locating and exhuming the graves of victims.{{sfn|Tremlett|2007}}
Under the 2007 law introduced by the socialist government of [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], Falangist symbols had to be removed from public view, and streets and plazas that honored Franco and his entourage had to be renamed.{{sfn|Govan|2010}}
The law was criticized by both left-wing and right-wing observers, for being too lenient or too severe.
A historian said that by focusing on the abuses committed by Franco the government was presenting the left-wing republican government in too favorable a light, ignoring the many problems of the feuding [[socialism|socialist]], [[anarchism|anarchist]], [[communism|communist]] and separatist groups.{{sfn|Kingstone|2007}}

In 2010 the department of National Heritage stopped offering tours of Franco's private quarters in the [[Royal Palace of El Pardo]], although tours of the older parts of the palace with "high artistic value" would continue.
In December 2010 the ''Valle de los Caidos'' was reopened, but with tight security systems to prevent vandalism or destruction by militant members of victims' associations.{{sfn|Govan|2010}}
As of 2011 the government was considering exhuming Franco's body from the ''Valle de los Caidos'' and reburying it beside his wife in a municipal cemetery.  There were some protests, but many supported the plan to transform the site into a place of reconciliation, with plaques to explain the past. [[Ramón Jáuregui]], the responsible minister, said, "We have dealt with the past little by little.  Maybe we're tackling this site a little late, but prudence has been the key to our peaceful transition."{{sfn|Rainsford|2011}}

There was much debate regarding symbols that might affect the Church, so an exception was introduced for religious reasons, and an exception made for monuments with particular artistic value. There are some emblematic symbols such as the yoke and arrows on the Casa Sindical (a brick tower facing the [[Museo del Prado]]) and the Central Headquarters of the [[Movimiento Nacional|Movimiento]], the Alcalá de Madrid which was built in a [[rationalist]] style.

In 2001 and following Professor Dumville's paper in ''Gildas: new approaches'', Clancy argued that [[St. Ninian]] was a Northumbrian spin-off of the name ''Uinniau'' (Irish [[Finnian of Moville|St Finnian]]), the Irish missionary to whom [[Columba|St. Columba]] was a [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]], who in [[Great Britain]] was associated with [[Whithorn]]. He argued that the confusion is due to an eighth century scribal spelling error, for which the similarities of "u" and "n" in the [[Insular script]] of the period were responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Although subsequently James E. Fraser has argued that the mistake was probably deliberate. See {{cite journal |doi= 10.3366/inr.2002.53.1.40 |last= Fraser|first= James E|authorlink= James E. Fraser (historian)|year= 2002|month= |title= Northumbrian Whithorn and the Making of St Ninian|journal= Innes Review|volume= 53|issue= |pages=40–59|issn= 0020-157X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Clancy has also done work on the ''[[Lebor Bretnach]]'', arguing that it was written in Scotland.

'''''Tit-Bits from all the interesting Books, Periodicals, and Newspapers of the World''''', more commonly known as '''''Tit-Bits''''', was a British weekly magazine founded by an early father of popular journalism [[George Newnes]] on 22 October 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bridget Griffen-Foley|title=From Tit-Bits to Big Brother: a century of audience participation in the media|journal=Media Culture and Society|date=2004|volume=26|issue=4|url=http://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/MEDIA165/%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%89%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B5%CF%82%20%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85-audience%20research-%CF%84%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%B7/big%20brother.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the magazine's headquarters moved from [[Manchester]] to [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Howard Cox|author2=Simon Mowatt|title=Technology, Organisation and Innovation: The Historical Development of the UK Magazine Industry|url=http://aut.researchgateway.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10292/1129/Technology_organisation.pdf?sequence=1&amp;origin=publication_detail|work=Auckland University of Technology|accessdate=25 June 2016|format=Research paper|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it paved the way for popular journalism — most significantly, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' was founded by [[Alfred Harmsworth]], a contributor to ''Tit-Bits'', and the ''[[Daily Express]]'' was launched by [[Sir Arthur Pearson, 1st Baronet|Arthur Pearson]], who worked at ''Tit-Bits'' for five years after winning a competition to get a job on the magazine.&lt;ref name = "Hulda"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Friederichs, Hulda|authorlink= | coauthors= | title=George Newnes| year=1911 | publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton (1911) Kessinger Publishing (2008) | location=London | isbn=978-0-548-88777-6 | pages=}} (republished 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

From the outset, the magazine was a mass-circulation commercial publication on cheap newsprint which soon reached sales of between 400,000 and 600,000. Like a mini-encyclopedia it presented a diverse range of tit-bits of information in an easy-to-read format, with the emphasis on human interest stories concentrating on drama and sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Conboy ''Journalism: A Critical History''&lt;/ref&gt; It also featured short stories and full-length fiction, including works by authors such as [[Henry Rider Haggard|Rider Haggard]] and [[Isaac Asimov]], plus three very early stories by [[Christopher Priest (novelist)|Christopher Priest]].

The first humorous article by [[P. G. Wodehouse]], "Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings", appeared in ''Tit-Bits'' in November 1900.&lt;ref&gt;From the chronology maintained by the [http://wodehouse.ru/chrono.htm Russian Wodehouse Society]&lt;/ref&gt; During the first world war [[Ivor Novello]] won a ''Titbits'' competition to write a song soldiers could sing at the front: he penned ''[[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song)|Keep the Home Fires Burning]]''.&lt;ref name="MagfTB"&gt;{{cite web|title= Tit-Bits/Titbits |url=http://www.magforum.com/mens/mensmagazinesatoz11.htm |work= Magforum |accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pin-ups appeared on the magazine's covers from 1939 and by 1955 circulation peaked at 1,150,000.  At the beginning of 1973 ''Tit-Bits'' lost the hyphen from its masthead. In 1979 ''[[Reveille (newspaper)|Reveille]]'' (a weekly tabloid with a virtually identical demographic) was merged into ''Titbits'', and the magazine was briefly rebranded as ''Titbits incorporating Reveille''. This however was dropped in July 1981. On 18 July 1984,&lt;ref name="MagfTB"/&gt; under its last editor Paul Hopkins, ''Titbits'' was selling only 170,000 copies and was taken over by Associated Newspapers' ''Weekend''. At the time, the ''Financial Times'' described ''Titbits'' as “the 103-year-old progenitor of Britain's popular press”&lt;ref name="MagfTB"/&gt;. ''Weekend'' itself closed in 1989.

==Cultural influence ==
In ''All Things Considered'' by [[G. K. Chesterton]], the author contrasts ''Tit-Bits'' with the ''Times'', saying: "Let any honest reader... ask himself whether he would really rather be asked in the next two hours to write the front page of ''The Times'', which is full of long leading articles, or the front page of ''Tit-Bits'', which is full of short jokes." Reference to the magazine is also made in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"In the tabledrawer he found an old number of Titbits." ''[[Ulysses (novel)#Episode 4.2C Calypso|Calypso]]'' episode of ''Ulysses'' by James Joyce.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'', [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]]'s ''[[Lost Horizon]]'', [[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[Moments of Being]]'', [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'' and AJ Cronin's ''The Stars Look Down''. It has been also mentioned in [[Stanley Houghton]]'s play [[The Dear Departed]]. Wells also mentioned it in his book ''Experiment in Autobiography''. The magazine is burlesqued as "Chit Chat" in [[George Gissing]]'s ''[[New Grub Street]]''. In the closing scene of the film ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' (1949), the protagonist Louis Mazzini ([[Dennis Price]]) is approached by a journalist ([[Arthur Lowe]]) from ''Tit-Bits''.

The magazine name survived as a glossy adult monthly ''Titbits International''.

The '''United States House Committee on Small Business''' is a standing committee of the [[United States House of Representatives]].

==History==
On December 4, 1941, the U. S. House of Representatives created the first House Select Committee on Small Business in response to a growing number of small business activists and organizations advocating for more protections and better government policies for America’s small businesses. While it had no legislative authority, the select committee became popular with House members and was reauthorized every following Congress until January 5, 1975, when it was made a permanent standing committee. House members then granted the new standing committee with certain areas of legislative jurisdiction and oversight functions, increasing its scope and influence.

Specifically, the House Small Business Committee is charged with assessing and investigating the problems of small businesses and examining the impact of general business practices and trends on small businesses. The committee has oversight and legislative authority over the Small Business Administration (SBA) and its programs, as well as provides assistance to and protection of small businesses, including financial aid and the participation of small business enterprises in federal procurement and government contracts.

==Jurisdiction==
The Small Business Committee has oversight and legislative jurisdiction over the [[Small Business Administration]] and its programs, as well provides assistance to and protection of small business, including financial aid and the participation of small business enterprises in federal procurement and government contracts. The committee also oversees matters related to the matters [[Regulatory Flexibility Act]] and the [[Paperwork Reduction Act]]. The jurisdiction extends to other programs and initiatives addressing small business outside of the confines of these two specific acts.&lt;ref&gt;Rep. [[Louise Slaughter]], {{USCongRec|2007|H9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rules.house.gov/ruleprec/110th.pdf |title=Rules of the House for the 110th Congress |access-date=2010-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528025556/http://www.rules.house.gov/ruleprec/110th.pdf |archive-date=2010-05-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yaxchilan''' ({{IPA-es|ʝaʃtʃiˈlan|pron}}) is an ancient [[Maya city]] located on the bank of the [[Usumacinta River]] in the state of [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]]. In the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic Period]] Yaxchilan was one of the most powerful [[Maya civilization|Maya]] states along the course of the [[Usumacinta River]], with [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]] as its major rival.&lt;ref name=ST421&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maya architecture|Architectural styles]] in subordinate sites in the Usumacinta region demonstrate clear differences that mark a clear boundary between the two kingdoms.&lt;ref name=ST421 /&gt;

Yaxchilan was a large center, important throughout the Classic era, and the dominant power of the Usumacinta River area.  It dominated such smaller sites as [[Bonampak]],&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p.125.&lt;/ref&gt; and had a long rivalry with Piedras Negras and at least for a time with [[Tikal]]; it was a rival of [[Palenque]], with which Yaxchilan warred in 654.

The site is particularly known for its well-preserved sculptured stone [[lintel]]s set above the doorways of the main structures.&lt;ref name=ST435&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 435&lt;/ref&gt; These lintels, together with the stelae erected before the major buildings, contain hieroglyphic texts describing the dynastic history of the city.&lt;ref name=ST435 /&gt;

==Etymology==
Epigraphers think that the ancient name for the city was probably the same as that of its realm,  '''Pa' Chan'''. {{IPA-myn|paʔ tʃan|pron}}, meaning "Cleft (or broken) Sky".&lt;ref&gt;Martin 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Early archaeologist [[Désiré Charnay]] dubbed the ruins "Lorillard City" in honor of [[Pierre Lorillard IV|Pierre Lorillard]] who contributed to defray the expense of his expedition into the Maya zone, while [[Alfred Maudslay]] named it "Menché". {{IPA-es|menˈtʃe|pron}} &lt;ref name=ST435 /&gt; [[Teoberto Maler]] gave it its modern name, said to mean "Green Stones" in an unspecified Maya language.&lt;ref name=ST435 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly 2001, p.348"&gt;Kelly 2001, p.348.&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, the Emblem Gylph was read as '''Siyaj Chan''', or "Sky Born".&lt;ref name=MG119&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[Image:Yaxchilan 1.jpg|thumb|right|West Acropolis of Yaxchilan]]
Yaxchilan is located on the south bank of the Usumacinta River, at the apex of a horseshoe-shaped [[meander]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon &amp; Grube 2000, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; This loop defends the site on all sides except for a narrow land approach from the south.&lt;ref name=ST435 /&gt; The site is {{convert|40|km|mi}} upriver from the ruins of [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]], its major rival.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; Yaxchilan is {{convert|21|km|mi}} from the ruins of [[Bonampak]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.136.&lt;/ref&gt; The site lies in [[Ocosingo]] Municipality in the [[Political divisions of Mexico|state]] of Chiapas, on the Mexican side of the international border with [[Guatemala]], which follows the line of river.&lt;ref name=K339&gt;Kelly 2001, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; It is {{convert|80|km|mi}} downriver from the Maya site [[Altar de Sacrificios]].&lt;ref name=ST435 /&gt;

Yaxchilan has its origins in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic Period]].&lt;ref name=ST421 /&gt; A large part of what is known of the Classic Period history of the city comes from the hieroglyphic texts of the kings who ruled during its Late Classic apogee, one of the most important of which is Hieroglyphic Stairway 1.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp. 431, 435&lt;/ref&gt; Some retrospective inscriptions appear to have been used to rewrite Yaxchilan's dynastic history to suit king [[Yaxun B'alam IV|Bird Jaguar IV]].&lt;ref name=ST431&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; Before the rule of king Itzamnaaj Balam II, who reigned from 681 to 742, the city was relatively small.&lt;ref name=ST431 /&gt; The city-state then grew to a regional capital and the dynasty lasted into the early 9th century.

===Early Classic===
The known history of Yaxchilan starts with the enthronement of Yopaat B'alam I, most likely on 23 July 359.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder of a long dynasty, and took the throne when Yaxchilan was still a minor site.&lt;ref name=ST431 /&gt; Hieroglyphic inscriptions dating to the Late Classic describe a series of wars in the Early Classic between the city and its neighbours.&lt;ref name=ST431 /&gt; K'inich Tatb'u Skull I ruled in the early 5th century and was the first of the rulers of Yaxchilan to be recorded as having taken a rival king as a war captive, his prisoner being king Bird Jaguar of Bonampak (not to be confused with the four rulers of Yaxchilan who bore the same name).&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.119" /&gt; The long running rivalry with Piedras Negras had already begun by the fifth century AD, with both cities struggling to dominate the Usumacinta trade route.&lt;ref name=ST431 /&gt; King Moon Skull was credited with gaining a victory over Piedras Negras in 460 and with capturing the enemy king, known only as Ruler A.&lt;ref name=ST431 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.119" /&gt; By the middle of the 5th century Yaxchilan had formal contacts with the great city of Tikal.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond 2000, p.234.&lt;/ref&gt; Bird Jaguar II, the next king of Yaxchilan, captured a vassal of the king of Piedras Negras around 478.&lt;ref name=ST431 /&gt;

Knot-eye Jaguar I was a warlike king who was recorded as capturing nobles from Bonampak, Piedras Negras and the great city of Tikal.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.120" /&gt; In 514, Knot-eye Jaguar I was taken captive by Ruler C of Piedras Negras, as depicted on Lintel 12 from that city, where he is shown kneeling before the enemy king with his wrists bound.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.120" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ST422&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 422&lt;/ref&gt;

His successor, K'inich Tatb'u Skull II, was enthroned on 11 February 526.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.121"/&gt; This king is notable for the series of carved lintels he commissioned, including a dynastic list that provides information on the early kings of the city.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.121"/&gt; K'inich Tatb'u Skull II oversaw a revival of Yaxchilan's fortunes and he captured lords from Bonampak, [[Lakamtuun]] and, notably, the lord of Calakmul, one of the two great Maya powers of the Classic Period, as well as a success against Tikal, the second great power.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.121"/&gt;

Little is known of the history of Yaxchilan from 537 to 629, although four kings are known to have reigned in this period.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.121"/&gt; Knot-eye Jaguar II is known to have captured the lord of [[Lacanha]] in 564, one of the few events that can be identified from this period.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.121"/&gt; It may be that the lack of an inscribed history for this lengthy period indicates that Yaxchilan had fallen under the dominion of a more powerful neighbour, such as Piedras Negras, [[Palenque]] or [[Toniná]], all of which were powerful polities in the Usumacinta region at this time.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp.122-3"/&gt;

===Late Classic===
The Yaxchilano murals at Bonampak's Structure I commemorate Yaxchilan's appointment of Chan Muwaan I as subordinate ruler. Yaxchilan rebuilt the site to point back toward Yaxchilan.

In 629, Bird Jaguar III was enthroned as king of Yaxchilan.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.122"/&gt; In 646 or 647 he captured a lord from the still unidentified site of [[Hix Witz]] (meaning "Jaguar Hill"), somewhere on the north side of the Usumacinta.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.122"/&gt;

Yaxchilan reached its greatest power during the reigns of King Itzamnaaj B'alam II, who died in his 90s in 742, and his son Bird Jaguar IV.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt; Itzamnaaj B'alam II was enthroned in October 681 and he ruled for more than sixty years.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.123"/&gt; During the last third of his reign he was responsible for a monumental building programme that included the erection of magnificent buildings with richly carved lintels, hieroglyphic stairways and carved stelae, transforming the centre of the city.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.123"/&gt; During his reign, the kingdom of Yaxchilán extended to include the nearby sites of [[La Pasadita]] and [[El Chicozapote]] to the northwest of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp.116, 124, 126.&lt;/ref&gt; At times the sites of Lacanha and Bonampak appear to have been under his domination, although this region was controlled by Toniná in 715.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 689, relatively early in his reign, Itzamnaaj B'alam II is recorded as having captured Aj Sak Ichiy Pat.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.124"/&gt; In 713 he captured Aj K'an Usja, the ''[[ajaw]]'', or lord, of B'uktunn, an otherwise unknown site.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.124"/&gt; In 726, Yaxchilan was defeated by its rival Piedras Negras, an event described on Piedras Negras Stela 8.&lt;ref name=ST422 /&gt; A ''sajal'' (subordinate lord) of Itzamnaaj B'alam II was captured by the enemy city, an event that is completely absent from inscriptions at Yaxchilán itself although, importantly, there is no false claim of victory.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.426. Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.123-4.&lt;/ref&gt; It is after this period, over forty years into the reign of Itzamnaaj B'alam II, that this king embarked upon his impressive building programme, this may indicate that at this time Yaxchilan was able to exert independence from the hegemony of once powerful neighbours and claim greater political independence and more lucrative control of [[Trade in Maya civilization|riverine trade]].&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.123"/&gt; In 729, Itzamnaaj B'alam II captured Aj Popol Chay, the lord of Lacanha.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.124"/&gt; This event, together with the other victories of Itzamnaaj Balam II's reign, is described both in the hieroglyphic texts of Structure 44 and also on a series of stelae near Structure 41.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.124"/&gt; This victory over Lacanha is compared to the earlier victory of Knot-eye Jaguar II against the same city.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.124"/&gt; Similarly, his capture of a lord of Hix Witz in 732 is compared to Bird Jaguar III's victory over the same site.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.124"/&gt;

In 749, Yopaat B'alam II of Yaxchilan attended a ceremony to honour [[Itzam K'an Ahk II]] of Piedras Negras.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; If Yopaat B'alam II was king of Yaxchilan at this time, this would indicate that he was subordinate to the king of Piedras Negras.&lt;ref name=ST4278&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp. 427-428&lt;/ref&gt; This event was recorded on Piedras Negras Panel 3; there are no records of the reign of Yopaat B'alam II at Yaxchilan itself, indicating that any records were later destroyed if he had indeed ruled there.&lt;ref name=ST4278 /&gt;

Yaxchilan retaliated in 759, gaining a victory over its enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; Circa 790 CE, Yaxchilan's king Shield Jaguar III oversaw the installation of Chan Muwaan II in Bonampak, and hired Yaxchilano artisans to commemorate it (and the previous Chan Muwaan) in "Structure I"'s murals.

In 808, king K'inich Tatb'u Skull III marked his capture of [[K'inich Yat Ahk II]], the last king of Piedras Negras, an event that probably represented the final overthrow of Yaxchilan's long running enemy, ending dynastic rule there and destroying the city as a capital.&lt;ref name=ST431 /&gt;

===Modern history===

King Itzamnaaj B'alam II is shown holding a torch, while his wife Lady K'ab'al Xook draws a barbed rope through her pierced tongue, [[British Museum]].]]

The first published mention of the site seems to have been a brief mention by [[Juan Galindo]] in 1833, published by the [[Royal Geographical Society]].&lt;ref name="Kelly 2001, p.347"&gt;Kelly 2001, p.347.&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor [[Edwin Rockstoh]] of the [[National College of Guatemala]] visited in 1881 and published another short account.&lt;ref name="Kelly 2001, p.347"/&gt; Explorers Alfred Maudslay and Désiré Charnay arrived here within days of each other in 1882, and they published more detailed accounts of the ruins with drawings and photographs.&lt;ref name="Kelly 2001, p.347"/&gt;  Maudslay's report was published by the Royal Geographical Society in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 2001, pp.347-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Teoberto Maler visited the site repeatedly from 1897 to 1900, his detailed two volume description of the ruins and other nearby sites was published by the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] of [[Harvard University]] in 1903.&lt;ref name=ST435 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly 2001, p.348"&gt;Kelly 2001, p.348.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 [[Sylvanus Morley]] led a [[Carnegie Institution]] expedition to Yaxchilan, mapped the site and discovered more monuments.

From 1970 onwards, [[Ian Graham]] made numerous visits to Yaxchilan and recorded the inscriptions there.&lt;ref name="Kelly 2001, p.348"/&gt; These inscriptions were published from 1977 onwards in the ''[[Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions]]'' by the Peabody Museum of Harvard University.&lt;ref name="Kelly 2001, p.348"/&gt;

The Mexican [[National Institute of Anthropology and History]] (INAH) conducted archeological research at Yaxchilan in 1972 - 1973, again in 1983, and further INAH work was conducted in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Kelly 2001, p.348"/&gt; INAH has consolidated and preserved the central portion of the site.&lt;ref name=ST435 /&gt;

[[Mayanist]] [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]] did some pioneering work on deciphering [[Maya writing]] using the inscriptions of Yaxchilan, and was able to identify the glyphs for death, capture and captor.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Peter Mathews and others have expanded on her early work.&lt;ref name=ST435 /&gt;

Since 1990, the project ''La Pintura Mural Prehispánica en México'' (Prehispanic Wall Painting in Mexico) of the [[Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas]] of the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] has examined and recorded precolumbian murals such as those at Yaxchilan.

Yaxchilan has long been difficult to reach other than by river. Until recently, no roads existed within 100 miles.  The only ways to get to the site were hundreds of miles by boat, or else by small plane.  Since the construction of the [[Border Highway]] by the Mexican Government in the early 1980s, it is possible for tourists to visit.  To reach the site, it is necessary now only to take an hour-long boat ride down the Usumacinta River from [[Frontera Corozal]].

Some [[Lacandon people|Lacandon]] Maya still make pilgrimages to Yaxchilan to carry out rituals to the Maya gods.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p.239.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The site==
The site contains impressive ruins, with palaces and temples bordering a large plaza upon a terrace above the Usumacinta River.&lt;ref name=ST435 /&gt; The architectural remains extend across the higher terraces and the hills to the south of the river, overlooking both the river itself and the lowlands beyond.&lt;ref name=ST435 /&gt; Yaxchilan is known for the large quantity of excellent sculpture at the site, such as the [[Monolith#Monumental monoliths|monolithic]] carved [[stela]]e and the narrative stone [[relief]]s carved on [[lintel (architecture)|lintel]]s spanning the temple doorways.&lt;ref name=ST435 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp. 117, 125&lt;/ref&gt; Over 120 inscriptions have been identified on the various monuments from the site.&lt;ref name="Kelly 2001, p.348"/&gt;

The major groups are the Central Acropolis, the West Acropolis and the South Acropolis.&lt;ref name=K341&gt;Kelly 2001, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; The South Acropolis occupies the highest part of the site.&lt;ref name=K342&gt;Kelly 2001, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; The site is aligned with relation to the Usumacinta River, at times causing unconventional orientation of the major structures, such as the two [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]].&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough 1991, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structures===
[[File:Yaxchilan Edificio 6.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Structure 6, south façade]]
'''Structure 6''' is near the Main Plaza in the Central Acropolis.&lt;ref name=K346&gt;Kelly 2001, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; It is in a good state of preservation and has six doorways, three facing the plaza and three facing the river.&lt;ref name=K346 /&gt; The doorways that open onto the plaza were blocked up in antiquity and new doorways were cut into the sides of the structure.&lt;ref name=K346 /&gt; The facade of the building facing the plaza has a surviving frieze with a sculpture of a head.&lt;ref name=K346 /&gt; The structure has a surviving perforated [[roof comb]] and is believed to date to the Early Classic.&lt;ref name=K346 /&gt;

'''Structure 7''' is beside Structure 6 but is in a much poorer state of preservation, with its vaulted ceiling having collapsed.&lt;ref name=K346 /&gt; This structure also had doorways facing both the river and the Main Plaza.&lt;ref name=K346 /&gt;

'''Structure 8''' is located in the Main Plaza in front of Structure 7 and divides the plaza into northwestern and southeastern sections.&lt;ref name=K3416&gt;Kelly 2001, pp. 341, 346.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure 13''' rests on an L-shaped platform in the Central Acropolis, together with Structures 10 and 74.&lt;ref name="Kelly 2001, p.347"/&gt;

'''Structure 14''' is the northwest ballcourt.&lt;ref name=K347&gt;Kelly 2001, p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on the Main Plaza of the Central Acropolis.&lt;ref name="Kelly 2001, pp. 341, 347"&gt;Kelly 2001, pp. 341, 347.&lt;/ref&gt; Five sculpted ballcourt markers were found here, three of which were aligned on the playing area and one on each of the platforms to either side.&lt;ref name=K347 /&gt; One of the ballcourt markers was removed from the site, the rest are broken and eroded.&lt;ref name=K347 /&gt;

'''Structure 16''' is close to the northwest ballcourt.&lt;ref name="Kelly 2001, pp. 341, 347"/&gt; It contains Lintels 38 through to 40, which have been reset in their original positions.&lt;ref name="K347" /&gt;

[[Image:Yaxchilan Structure 19.jpg|thumb|left|Structure 19 in the Central Acropolis.&lt;ref name=K342 /&gt;]]
'''Structure 19''' is also known as the Labyrinth.&lt;ref name=K339 /&gt; It lies at the western edge of the Central Acropolis.&lt;ref name=K341 /&gt; The structure is a temple with rooms spread over three levels, linked by interior stairways.&lt;ref name=K339 /&gt; The temple facade has four doorways, with three doorway-sized niches between them.&lt;ref name=K339 /&gt; Two sculptured altars are located in front of the structure, which still has the remains of a perforated roof comb.&lt;ref name=K339 /&gt;

'''Structure 20''' is in the Central Acropolis and has three rooms.&lt;ref name=K345&gt;Kelly 2001, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; The three doorways to this structure once supported sculpted Lintels 12, 13 and 14, although only two now remain.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt; A small amount of the roof comb of the building remains, and the sloped roof still has surviving friezes containing niches.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt; Structure 20 was excavated by Ian Graham in 1982, during the excavations a hieroglyphic step was found in front of the building, it was reburied in order to preserve it.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt;

'''Structure 21''' is on a terrace below Structure 25 and 26.&lt;ref name=K344&gt;Kelly 2001, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; The three lintels over the doorways in this structure were Lintels 15 through to 17, although they were removed in the 19th century and are now in the [[British Museum]] in London.&lt;ref name=K344 /&gt; Structure 21 was excavated in 1983.&lt;ref name=K344 /&gt; The vaulted roof of the structure had already collapsed before 1882, filling the rooms with rubble that has now been removed, uncovering several important monuments, including Stela 35 and the remains of life size stucco figures on the back wall behind the stela itself.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 2001, pp. 344-345&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure 26''' is located beside Structure 25 in the Central Acropolis and has not been excavated.&lt;ref name=K344 /&gt; It is the least well preserved of the two structures.&lt;ref name=K344 /&gt;

'''Structure 30''' is in the Central Acropolis, it has three doorways facing onto the Plaza.&lt;ref name=K339 /&gt; The structure has two parallel rooms with well-preserved vaulting.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 2001, pp. 339, 341&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure 33''', in the Central Acropolis, has been described as a masterpiece in stone and was probably dedicated in 756 by Bird Jaguar IV.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 2001, pp. 342, 344&lt;/ref&gt; The structure overlooks the plaza and the river and would have been prominent to river traffic in the 8th century.&lt;ref name=K344 /&gt; It has plain lower walls with three doorways, each of the which supports a well-preserved lintel (Yaxchilan Lintels 1 to 3).&lt;ref name=K342 /&gt; In centre of the back wall of the structure, opposite the central doorway, is a niche containing the headless sculpture of a human figure, probably Bird Jaguar IV himself.&lt;ref name=K344 /&gt; The roof of the structure is largely intact, including a sloped roof supporting a frieze and a well-preserved roof comb.&lt;ref name=K342 /&gt; There are niches in both the roof comb and the frieze, the niche in the roof comb contains the remains of a sculpted figure.&lt;ref name=K342 /&gt; Tennons on both roof sections once supported stucco decoration.&lt;ref name=K342 /&gt; Leading up to the front of Structure 33 from the plaza is a stairway, the top step of which is sculpted, this step is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 2.&lt;ref name=K344 /&gt;

'''[[Yaxchilan Lintel 24|Lintel 24]]''' is sculpted from limestone and is regarded as a masterpiece of Maya art.&lt;ref name=BMl24 /&gt; It is one of a series of three lintels that were set above the doorways of Structure 23, this one having been set above the southeast doorway.&lt;ref name=BMl24 /&gt; It shows a bloodletting ritual being carried out by king Itzamnaaj B'alam II and his wife Lady K'ab'al Xook, the king stands holding a burning torch over his wife, who pulls a spiked rope through her tongue.&lt;ref name=BMl24 /&gt; A screenfold book lies in a basket in front of the kneeling princess.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.104"&gt;Coe 1999, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt; The lintel has traces of red and blue pigments.&lt;ref name=BMl24 /&gt; The ceremony represented on the sculpture took place on 28 October, 709.&lt;ref name=BMl24 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.104"/&gt; Lintel 24 was removed at the end of the 19th century and is now on display in the British Museum.&lt;ref name=BMl24 /&gt;

'''Lintel 25''' was originally set above the central doorway of Structure 23.&lt;ref name=BMl25 /&gt; It was carved from limestone during the reign of king Itzamnaaj B'alam II and shows Lady Xook invoking the Vision Serpent to commemorate the accession of her husband to the throne.&lt;ref name=BMl25 /&gt; Lady Xook holds a bowl containing bloodletting apparatus consisting of a stingray spine and bloodstained paper.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.126"&gt;Coe 1999, p.126.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vision Serpent rising before her has two heads, one at each extreme, from the mouth of one emerges a warrior, from the other emerges the head of central Mexican deity [[Tlaloc]], a water god from the distant metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]] in the [[Valley of Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p.126"/&gt; The hieroglyphic inscription on the lintel is unusual, being reversed as if it were meant to be read in a mirror, although the significance of this is unknown.&lt;ref name=BMl25 /&gt; Like Lintel 24, Lintel 25 was removed at the end of the 19th century and is now on display in the British Museum.&lt;ref name=BMl24 /&gt; The events depicted on the lintel are described as having occurred "in front of the water of Siyan Chan", a reference to the main plaza of the city being located on the shore of the Usumacinta River.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Looper 2005, p.354.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lintel 38''', '''Lintel 39''' and '''Lintel 40''' have been reset in their original positions in Structure 16 in the Central Acropolis.&lt;ref name="K347" /&gt; Unlike most of the other lintels at Yaxchilan, they are sculpted on their edges instead of the undersides.&lt;ref name="K347" /&gt;

'''Lintel 41''' was set above the south doorway of Structure 42 in the West Acropolis.&lt;ref name=K341 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BMl41 /&gt; It had fallen and broken into two pieces when Maudsley found it in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=BMl41 /&gt; The upper section is on display in the British Museum, the lower section is damaged.&lt;ref name=BMl41 /&gt; The lintel was carved from limestone and is one of a series of lintels set in the same structure that celebrate the victories of king Bird Jaguar IV.&lt;ref name=BMl41 /&gt; The king is shown preparing for a battle that took place in 755, his wife is offering him his spear, she is Lady Wak Jalam Chan Ajaw from the site of [[Motul de San José]] in the [[Petén Basin|Petén]] Lakes region of Guatemala.&lt;ref name=BMl41 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stelae====
[[Image:Yaxchilan Stela 35.jpg|thumb|left|Stela 35 inside Structure 21, dating to the Late Classic. It depicts [[Lady Eveningstar]], the mother of Bird Jaguar IV.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt;]]
'''Stela 2''' is on the lowest terrace opposite the stairway approach to Structure 33.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt; It is badly weathered and dates to 613.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.121"/&gt;&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt;

'''Stela 3''' stands on a platform in the middle of a plaza by Structure 20.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt; It was badly damaged and the fragments have been reassembled and the monument re-erected.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt; One side of the stela has well-preserved sculpture.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt;

'''Stela 5''' is in front of the terrace holding Structure 20.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt; The upper part of this monument depicts king Itzamnaaj B'alam II.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt;

'''Stela 6''' stands in front of the terrace supporting Structure 20.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt; It is largely intact and depicts the 7th-century ruler Bird Jaguar III.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt;

'''Stela 7''' was badly damaged, being broken into fragments.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt; The monument has now been reassembled and the surviving sculpture is of excellent quality.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt; The stela stands in front of a terrace below Structure 20.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt; It depicts a kneeling figure.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt;

'''Stela 11''' originally stood in front of Structure 40.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt; The stela was removed in 1964 and shipped upriver to Agua Azul to be flown to Mexico City for display in the Museo Nacional de Antropología.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt; However, it was too heavy to fly and was returned to Yaxchilan in 1965 and now lies near the bank of the river.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt; The upper side of the stela depicts king Bird Jaguar IV and his father.&lt;ref name=K346 /&gt; The figures and the accompanying hieroglyphic panel are very well preserved.&lt;ref name=K346 /&gt; There are various dates inscribed on the stela with the earliest being 741.&lt;ref name=K346 /&gt; The stela is broken into two parts.&lt;ref name=K346 /&gt;

'''Stela 18''' dates from some time after 723.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.123"/&gt; It depicts the victorious king Itzamnaaj B'alam II standing over a kneeling captive, who is identified as Aj Popol Chaj, the ruling lord of Lacanha.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.123"/&gt;

'''Stela 27''' has been re-erected in front of Structure 9 on the Main Plaza in the Central Acropolis. The monument dates to 514 and depicts the king Knot-eye Jaguar I.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 2001, pp. 346-347. Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.120.&lt;/ref&gt; This stela is the earliest known from Yaxchilan.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.120" /&gt; Stela 27 is particularly notable because it was obviously damaged in antiquity and subsequently restored in the Late Classic, with substantial reworking in the lower third of the stela dating to the time of Bird Jaguar IV.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.120" /&gt;

'''Stela 31''' is located a short distance in front of Structure 33.&lt;ref name=K344 /&gt; It is a particularly unusual monument because it is sculpted from a [[stalactite]].&lt;ref name=K344 /&gt; It is undated and depicts three incised figures and some hieroglyphs.&lt;ref name=K344 /&gt;

'''Stela 33''' is a fragmented monument that was discovered during excavations of the platform supporting Stela 3.&lt;ref name=K345 /&gt;

'''Stela 35''' is an exceptionally well preserved monument found during excavations of Structure 21 in 1983.&lt;ref name=K344 /&gt; The stela is fairly small and depicts [[Lady Eveningstar]] (also known as Lady Ik Skull), the mother of king Bird Jaguar IV.&lt;ref name=K344 /&gt;

'''''Šatrovački''''' ({{IPA-sh|ʃatr̩oʋatʃki}}; [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: шатровачки) or '''''šatra''''' ({{IPA-sh|ʃatr̩a}}; [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]:  шатра) is an argot in the [[Serbo-Croatian]] language. Šatrovački was initially developed by various [[subculture]]s in [[Yugoslavia]] and used a form of secret communication within various [[ingroup]]s. Today, it is primarily used among youth as a form of [[pig latin]]. It is more widespread in urban areas, such as capitals [[Belgrade]] (Serbia), [[Zagreb]] (Croatia) and [[Sarajevo]] (Bosnia and Herzegovina).

==Standard šatrovački==
Words are formed by replacing the syllable order. For example: '''''pi'''vo'' (beer), becomes ''vo'''pi'''''. The new word has the same meaning as the stem. Since the spelling is nearly phonetic it does not change. However, sometimes one of the vowels is changed to make the new word easier to pronounce, avoid ambiguity, or if the stem word is not in [[nominative]]. For example, ''tra'''va''''' ("grass", marijuana) would become ''vutra'' instead of ''vatra'' ("fire").

Some words are more commonly spoken in Šatrovački than others, but there is no specific rule. Examples of  transformed sentences (although, most of the words in a single sentence are rarely transformed) are:

*''Brate, neću da igram fudbal. — Tebra, ćune da ramig dbalfu.'' ("Bro, I don't want to play football.")
*''Zemun zakon brate. — Munze konza tebra.''  (literally: "[[Zemun]] is the law, bro" - meaning: "Zemun rules dude")
*''Pazi brate, murija! — Zipa tebra, rijamu!'' ("Watch out mate - cops!", ''murija'' slang for police)

=== Examples ===
* '''zeldi''' - dizel (''[[Dizelaši]]'', chavs)
* '''ciba''' - baci (throw; imperative)
* '''mojne''' - nemoj (don't; imperative)
* '''loma''' - malo (a little, few)
* '''tebra''' - brate (brother; vocative)
* '''Ganci''' - Ciganin (Gypsy)
* '''ljakse''' - seljak (peasant, [[redneck]])
* '''zipa''' - pazi (watch out, pay attention; [[Imperative mood|imperative]])
* '''tenkre''' - kreten ([[retard (pejorative)|retard]])
* '''zabr nahra''' - brza hrana ([[fast food]])
* '''hopsi''' - psiho ([[psychopath]])
* '''vugla''' - glava (head)
* '''ljadro''' - drolja ([[slut]])
* '''vutra''' - trava ([[weed]], marijuana)
* '''fuka''' - kafa ([[coffee]])
* '''gudra''' - droga (drugs)
* '''vopi''' - pivo (beer)
* '''suljpa''' - pasulj (beans)
* '''vozdra''' - zdravo (hello)
* '''dismr''' - smrdi (stinks)
* '''žika''' - kaži (say, speak; imperative)
* '''konza''' - zakon (law, great, excellent)
* '''dbalfu''' - fudbal (soccer)
* '''vuspra''' - sprava (device, [[spliff]])
* '''cupi''' - pica (cunny, pretty girl)
* '''rijamu''' - murija (cops)
* '''sajsi''' - sisaj (suck; imperative)
* '''Šone''' - [[Nenad|Nešo]] ([[hypocorism]])
* '''Šomi''' - [[Miloš|Mišo]] (hypocorism)
* '''Kizo''' - [[Zoran|Zoki]] (hypocorism)
* '''Rijama''' - [[Marija]]
* '''Kblo Konza''' - Blok Zakon ([[New Belgrade Blocks|Block]] rules)
* '''Munze Konza''' - Zemun Zakon ([[Zemun]] rules)
* '''tozla''' - zlato (gold)
* '''pakšu''' - šupak ([[asshole]])
* '''racku''' - kurac (dick, penis)
* '''žmu''' - muž (husband)
*'''Rajvosa''' - [[Sarajevo]]
* '''ne rise''' - ne seri (no shit, cut the crap; imperative)
* '''sepra''' - prase (pig)
* '''šipu'''  - puši (smoke, [[fellatio|blow]]; imperative)

==Utrovački==

'''Utrovački''' (Утровачки) is a more complex form of ''šatrovački''. Words are formed using: U + last part + ZA + first part + NJE. E.g. '''vikipedija''' (Wikipedia) becomes u'''kipedija'''za'''vi'''nje. Today, utrovački is not widely used.

Alternative Utrovački is same as above, but without "ZA", e.g. '''pivo''' (beer) becomes u'''vopi'''nje, or '''cigare''' (tobacco) becomes u'''gareci'''nje.

==Syllable omission==

A more simplified version of šatrovački is using only parts of the word, while excluding the first syllable, and is most commonly used among young people in Serbia. For example, kon'''cert''' (concert) would be shorthened to '''cert'''. The rules of creating a new word that can be used in [[nominative]] while the stem is not apply similarly to standard šatrovački. An example of a full sentence would be:

:: ''Drugar i ja idemo na koncert na Tvrđavi.'' (My friend and I are going to a concert on the Fortress)
:: ''Gari i ja idemo na cert na Đavi.''

This is particularly characteristic of [[Novi Sad]] youth subculture, and is very rarely spoken outside of [[Vojvodina]].

===Common examples===
* '''zika''' - muzika (music)
* '''cert''' - koncert (concert)
* '''Đava''' - tvrđava (fortress, almost exclusively refers to [[Petrovaradin fortress]] in Novi Sad)
* '''gari''' - drugar (friend)
* '''fika''' - trafika (news stand)
* '''kić''' - sokić (diminutive of juice)
* '''nica''' - stanica (station)
* '''šulja''' - košulja (shirt)
* '''lone''' - pantalone (trousers)
* '''tike''' - patike (sneakers)
* '''njačić''' - vinjačić ([[Diminutive]] for [[Vinjak]], an alcoholic drink similar to [[Cognac (drink)|Cognac]])
* '''tija''' - kutija (box)
* '''ljara''' - pepeljara (ashtray)
* '''ljada''' - hiljada (thousand)
* '''bica''' - torbica (small bag)
* '''čka''' - pička (cunt)
* '''pač''' - štampač (printer)
* '''činka''' - palačinka (crêpe, pancake)
* '''ler''' - drug dealer (usually of [[marijuana]])
* '''ket''' - paket (package or anything packed or wrapped)
* '''ćoza''' - kaprićoza (usually refers to [[Pizza capricciosa]], but can be used for any kind of pizza)

==Adding syllables==

A very rare but present form of expression found in the Belgrade projects (blokovi). Words are reconstructed by adding various suffixes so that the original word remains relatively intact. Usually, the basis is šatrovački. The resulting words have a generally diminutive meaning.

===Examples===

* '''kajblo or kićblo''' - blok (Blok of suburb [[Blokovi]] or [[New Belgrade]])
* '''kićso or kajso''' - sok (juice)
* '''pajdo''' - dop (heroin)

These diminutives can later be combined using the '''Šatrovački''' method, resulting in words like ''kajblo'', or ''kićblo''. However, this is a rare usage, confined to the area of [[Zemun]] and [[New Belgrade]].

Also there is another type of šatrovački, where the words are reconstructed by addition of letter P after each syllable:

===Examples===

* '''di'''pi'''ze'''pe'''l''' - dizel (chav)
* '''ba'''pa'''ci'''pi - baci (throw)
* '''ne'''pe'''mo'''po'''j''' - nemoj (don't)
* '''ma'''pa'''lo'''po - malo (some)
* '''bra'''pa'''te'''pe - brate (brother)
* '''ci'''pi'''ga'''pa'''n''' - cigan (gypsy)
* '''pe'''pe'''de'''pe'''r''' - peder (homosexual)
* '''se'''pe'''lja'''pa'''k''' - seljak (peasant)
* '''pa'''pa'''zi'''pi - pazi (pay attention)
* '''kre'''pe'''te'''pe'''n''' - kreten (idiot)
