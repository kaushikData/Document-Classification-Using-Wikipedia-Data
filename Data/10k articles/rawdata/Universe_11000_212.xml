'''Alexander M. Gorlov''' (March 23, 1931 – June 10, 2016) was a Russian [[mechanical engineer]] who was Professor Emeritus and Director of Hydro-Pneumatic Power Laboratory at [[Northeastern University]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/alexander-gorlov-obituary?pid=1000000180295978|title=Alexander Gorlov Obituary - Brookline, Massachusetts|first=|last=admin|date=30 September 2015|work=legacy.com|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Alexander M. Gorlov was born into the family of a prosperous lawyer. His father was arrested and died in prison during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s purges. His mother also spent a number of years in concentration camps in Russia, which forced young Alexander Gorlov to spend some of his childhood years in the orphanage in a remote Russian [[Urals]] area.

Gorlov received his Doctorate in engineering and had a successful scientific career in Moscow for a number of years during the relatively liberal period of the so-called [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. He was granted the Gold and two Bronze Medals for Achievements of the USSR National Economy. In 1975 because of his friendship with [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]], the [[Nobel Prize]] winner and outspoken critic of the communist system, Gorlov was forced to break with his Soviet life and emigrate, eventually establishing a new home in the United States.

== Career ==
Since 1976 Gorlov has been teaching [[Mechanical Engineering]] in the [[Northeastern University]] combining it with extensive research work in the area of harnessing renewable energy from water flows and wind.  In the pursuit of his lifelong dream of creating inexpensive, environmentally friendly hydro-power, Gorlov has developed helical turbines for use in the river, tidal, and open ocean currents. His innovation has led to a series of patents for the [[Gorlov helical turbine|Gorlov Helical Turbine]] which shows great promise for alleviating the worldwide crisis in energy use.  This invention was named one of ''[[Popular Science]]'''s top 100 innovations of 2001. One of the other Gorlov's inventions - "Terrorist Truck-Bomb Protection System" - is certified by four US patents and is placed on the US [[Department of State]] list of certified equipment. That allows the system to be used for protection of vital Government installations such as nuclear power plants, military bases around the world, embassies, bridges and tunnels as well as other potential strategic targets from terrorist attacks. 
 
Gorlov has over 100 technical publications, including books, and 25 US and international patents in such fields as [[renewable energy]], [[structural analysis]] &amp; design, [[theoretical mechanics]] and the design of bridges and tunnels.

== International engineering activity ==
*Bridges and tunnels (Russia, design and construction)
*Hydro power plant on [[Aswan Dam]] Project in River [[Nile]] ([[Egypt]])
*Hydro power plants on rivers Khram, Langanury ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) and [[Lake Sevan]] ([[Armenia]])
*Implementation of [[Gorlov helical turbine|helical turbine]] for extracting tidal energy in [[Uldolmok Strait]] ([[Korea]]) and Chacao Channel [[Chile]]

== Awards ==
*2001, [[Thomas Edison]] Award by [[ASME]] for invention of the [[Gorlov helical turbine|helical turbine]].
*2011, Nominated for the European Inventor Award for invention of the helical turbine.

== Personal ==
Professor Alexander M. Gorlov was a resident of [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] and [[Falmouth, Massachusetts|Falmouth]] (both in [[Massachusetts]], USA), where he lived with his wife Ella who is a local historian.

The '''Barra system''' is a [[passive solar]] building technology developed by Horazio Barra in [[Italy]].  It uses a collector wall to capture [[solar radiation]] in the form of heat. It also uses the [[thermosiphon]] effect to distribute the warmed air through channels incorporated into the [[reinforced concrete]] floors, warming the floors and hence the building. Alternatively, in hot weather, cool nighttime air can be drawn through the floors to chill them in a form of [[air conditioning]]. &lt;!-- OK, from the title of the book it seems it does use just a thermosiphon...--&gt;

Barra's are said to have more uniform north-south temperature distributions than other passive solar houses{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Many successful systems were built in [[Europe]], but Barra seems fairly unknown elsewhere.

==Passive solar collector==
To convert the sun's light into heat indirectly, a separate insulated space is constructed on the sunny side of the house walls.  &lt;!--Diagram needed  --&gt;  Looking at the outside, and moving through a cross section there is an outside clear layer.  This was traditionally built using [[glass]], but with the advent of cheap, robust [[Polycarbonate]] glazing most designs use twin- or triple-wall polycarbonate greenhouse sheeting.  Typically the glazing is designed to pass visible light, but block [[Infrared|IR]] to reduce losses, and block [[Ultraviolet|UV]] to protect building materials.

The next layer is an absorption space.  This absorbs most of the light entering the collector.  It usually consists of an air gap of around 10&amp;nbsp;cm thickness with one or more absorption meshes suspended vertically in the space. Often window [[fly screen]] mesh is used, or horticultural [[shade cloth]].  The mesh itself can hold very little heat and warms up rapidly in light.  The heat is absorbed by air passing around and through the mesh, and so the mesh is suspended with an air gap on both the front and back sides.

Finally a layer of insulation sits between the absorption space and the house.  Usually this is normal house insulation, using materials such as [[polyisocyanurate]] foam, [[rock wool]], foil and [[polystyrene]].

This collector is very responsive - in the sun it heats up rapidly and the air inside starts to convect.  If the collector were to be directly connected to the building using a hole near the floor and a hole near the ceiling an indirect solar gain system would be created.  One problem with this that, like [[Trombe wall]]s, the heat would radiate back out at night, and a convection current would chill the room during the night.  Instead, the air movement can be stopped using automatic dampers, similar to those used for ventilating foundation spaces in cold climates, or plastic film dampers, which work by blocking air flow in one direction with a very lightweight flap of plastic.  The addition of the damper makes the design an efficient isolated solar gain system.

==Thermal store==
To store the thermal energy from the collector,  the Barra system suspends a "spancrete" slab of concrete as a ceiling to store heat.  This is fairly expensive and requires strong support.  An alternative is to use water, which can store 5 times as much heat for a given weight&lt;!--Schaum's 'Heat Transfer'--&gt;.  A simple, cheap and effective way is to store the water in sealed 100&amp;nbsp;mm diameter PVC storm pipe with end caps.

Whether water or concrete is used, the heat is transferred from the air in the collector into the storage material during the day, and released on demand using a ceiling fan into the room at night.

Where "spancrete" slabs are used, the ceiling also heats the house by radiation.  Some houses are fitted with [[louver]]s (similar to those used on [[satellites]]) to adjust the radiation transfer. Warm air travels through the slab tunnels from south to north, where it exits and travels back south through the bulk of the room to the air heater inlet near the floor.

===Intermediate thermal store===
In most places a system designed for 5 successive days of no sun provides enough storage for all but a few days in a hundred years. Heat can be stored over a number of days using a large container of water.  An 8-foot cube of water in the basement might store 15 kL of water, which is heated using a copper tube with fins in the collector.  The performance of this can be further improved by putting the finned tube inside another layer of glazing at the back of the main collector, allowing the temperature to build up more than the surrounding air stream.  On cloudy days the heat is transferred back out of the store to heat the house.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47295">This page describes how '''[[uranium dioxide]] [[nuclear fuel]]''' behaves during both normal [[nuclear reactor]] operation and under reactor [[nuclear accident|accident]] conditions, such as overheating. Work in this area is often very expensive to conduct, and so has often been performed on a collaborative basis between groups of countries, usually under the aegis of the [[CSNI]].

[[File:FPT1fueltestPhebus.png|right|thumb|This is a false colour tomography picture of a bundle (FPT1) of 18 irradiated fuel rods (23&amp;nbsp;GWd/tU mean burn-up) degraded under steam as part of the PHEBUS set of experiments. The black and blue is for areas of low density while red is an area of high density. It can be seen that the fuel has failed mechanically and has formed a pool near the bottom of the bundle. The bottom of the bundle did not melt.]]

==Swelling==

===Cladding===
Both the fuel and cladding can swell. Cladding covers the fuel to form a fuel pin and can be deformed. It is normal to fill the gap between the fuel and the [[Cladding (nuclear fuel)|cladding]] with [[helium]] gas to permit better thermal contact between the fuel and the cladding. During use the amount of gas inside the fuel pin can increase because of the formation of [[noble gas]]es ([[krypton]] and [[xenon]]) by the fission process. If a [[Loss-of-coolant accident]] (LOCA) (e.g. [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]]) or a [[Reactivity Initiated Accident]] (RIA) (e.g. [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] or [[SL-1]]) occurs then the temperature of this gas can increase. As the fuel pin is sealed the [[pressure]] of the gas will increase (PV&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;nRT) and it is possible to deform and burst the cladding. It has been noticed that both [[corrosion]] and [[irradiation]] can alter the properties of the [[zircaloy|zirconium alloy]] commonly used as cladding, making it [[brittle]]. As a result, the experiments using unirradated zirconium alloy tubes can be misleading.

According to one paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3327/jnst.41.37 |author1=T. Nakamura |author2=T. Fuketa |author3=T. Sugiyama |author4=H. Sasajima |journal=Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology |year=2004 |volume=41 |pages=37 |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnst/41/1/37/_pdf |title=Failure Thresholds of High Burnup BWR Fuel Rods under RIA Conditions |issue=1 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the following difference between the cladding failure mode of unused and used fuel was seen.

Unirradiated fuel rods were pressurized before being placed in a special reactor at the Japanese [[Nuclear Safety Research Reactor]] (NSRR) where they were subjected to a simulated RIA transient. These rods failed after ballooning late in the transient when the cladding temperature was high. The failure of the cladding in these tests was [[ductile]], and it was a burst opening.

The used fuel (61 GW days/[[tonne]] of uranium) failed early in the transient with a [[brittle fracture]] which was a longitudinal crack.

It was found that [[hydride]]d zirconium tube is weaker and the bursting pressure is lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3327/jnst.42.58|author1=F. Nagase  |author2=T. Fuketa |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Investigation of Hydride Rim Effect on Failure of Zircaloy-4 Cladding with Tube Burst Test|journal=Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology|year=2005|volume=42|pages=58–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common failure process of fuel in the water-cooled reactors is a transition to film boiling and subsequent ignition of zirconium cladding in the steam. The effects of the intense hot hydrogen reaction product flow on the fuel pellets and on the bundle's wall well represented on the sidebar picture.

===Fuel===
The [[nuclear fuel]] can [[radiation-induced swelling|swell]] during use, this is because of effects such as fission gas formation in the fuel and the damage which occurs to the lattice of the solid. The fission gases accumulate in the void that forms in the center of a fuel pellet as burnup increases.  As the void forms, the once-cylindrical pellet degrades into pieces.  The swelling of the fuel pellet can cause pellet-cladding interaction when it thermally expands to the inside of the cladding tubing.  The swollen fuel pellet imposes mechanical stresses upon the cladding. A document on the subject of the swelling of the fuel can be downloaded from the [[NASA]] web site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700006935_1970006935.pdf Simplified analysis of nuclear fuel pin swelling]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fission gas release==
As the fuel is degraded or heated the more volatile fission products which are trapped within the [[uranium dioxide]] may become free. For example, see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jnucmat.2005.09.024|author=J.Y. Colle|author2=J.P. Hiernaut|author3=D. Papaioannou|author4=C. Ronchi|author5=A. Sasahara|title=Fission product release in high-burn-up UO2 oxidized to U3O8|journal=Journal of Nuclear Materials|year=2006|volume=348|issue=3|pages=229|bibcode = 2006JNuM..348..229C  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report on the release of &lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;Kr, &lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Ru and &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs from uranium when air is present has been written. It was found that uranium dioxide was converted to U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; between about 300 and 500&amp;nbsp;°C in air. They report that this process requires some time to start, after the induction time the sample gains mass. The authors report that a layer of U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; was present on the uranium dioxide surface during this induction time. They report that 3 to 8% of the [[krypton]]-85 was released, and that much less of the [[ruthenium]] (0.5%) and [[caesium]] (2.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;%) occurred during the oxidation of the uranium dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/inis/aws/htgr/fulltext/iwggcr13_11.pdf P. Wood and G.H. Bannister, CEGB report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613210309/http://www.iaea.org/inis/aws/htgr/fulltext/iwggcr13_11.pdf |date=2006-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat transfer between the cladding and the water==
In a water-cooled power reactor (or in a water-filled [[spent fuel pool]], SFP), if a power surge occurs as a result of a [[reactivity initiated accident]], an understanding of the transfer of heat from the surface of the cladding to the water is very useful. In a French study, metal pipe immersed in water (both under typical [[pressurized water reactor|PWR]] and SFP conditions), was electrically heated to simulate the generation of heat within a fuel pin by nuclear processes. The [[temperature]] of the pipe was monitored by [[thermocouple]]s and for the tests conducted under [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]] conditions the water entering the larger pipe (14.2&amp;nbsp;mm diameter) holding the test metal pipe (9.5&amp;nbsp;mm outside diameter and 600&amp;nbsp;mm long) was at 280&amp;nbsp;°C and 15&amp;nbsp;MPa. The water was flowing past the inner pipe at ''circa'' 4&amp;nbsp;ms&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and the cladding was subjected to heating at 2200 to 4900&amp;nbsp;°C&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to simulate an RIA. It was found that as the temperature of the cladding increased the rate of heat transfer from the surface of the cladding increased at first as the water boiled at [[nucleation]] sites. When the heat flux is greater than the [[critical heat flux]] a boiling crisis occurs. This occurs as the temperature of the fuel cladding surface increases so that the surface of the metal was too hot (surface dries out) for [[nucleation boiling]]. When the surface dries out the rate of [[heat transfer]] decreases, after a further increase in the temperature of the metal surface the boiling resumes but it is now [[film boiling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3327/jnst.44.211|author=V. Bessiron|title=Modelling of Clad-to-Coolant Heat Transfer for RIA Applications|journal=Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology|year=2007|volume=44|issue=2|pages=211–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corrosion and other changes to materials in the reactor==

{{Empty section|date=May 2013}}

==Hydriding and Waterside Corrosion==
As a nuclear fuel bundle increases in burnup (time in reactor), the radiation begins changing not only the fuel pellets inside the cladding, but the cladding material itself.  The zirconium chemically reacts to the water flowing around it as coolant, forming a protective oxide on the surface of the cladding.  Typically a fifth of the cladding wall will be consumed by oxide in PWRs.  There is a smaller corrosion layer thickness in BWRs.  The chemical reaction that takes place is:

Zr + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O -&gt; ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(gas)

Hydriding occurs when the product gas (hydrogen) precipitates out as hydrides within the zirconium.  This causes the cladding to become embrittled, instead of ductile.  The hydride bands form in rings within the cladding.  As the cladding experiences hoop stress from the growing amount of fission products, the hoop stress increases.  The material limitations of the cladding is one aspect that limits the amount of burnup nuclear fuel can accumlate in a reactor.

CRUD (Chalk River Unidentified Deposits) was discovered by [[Chalk River Laboratories]]. It occurs on the exterior of the clad as burnup is accumulated.

When a nuclear fuel assembly is prepared for onsite storage, it is dried and moved to a [[spent nuclear fuel shipping cask]] with scores of other assemblies.  Then it sits on a concrete pad for a number of years waiting for an intermediate storage facility or reprocessing.  The transportation of radiation-damaged cladding is tricky, because it is so fragile.  After being removed from the reactor and cooling down in the spent fuel pool, the hydrides within the cladding of an assembly reorient themselves so that they radially point out from the fuel, rather than circularly in the direction of the hoop stress.  This puts the fuel in a situation so that when it is moved to its final resting place, if the cask were to fall, the cladding would be so weak it could break and release the spent fuel pellets inside the cask.

===Corrosion on the inside of the cladding===
[[Zirconium]] alloys can undergo [[stress corrosion cracking]] when exposed to iodine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gladkov, V.P. |author2=Petrov, V.I. |author3=Svetlov, A.V. |author4=Smirnov, E.A. |author5=Tenishev, V.I. |author6=Bibilashvili, Yu. K. |author7=Novikov, V.V |journal=Atomic Energy|year=1994|volume=75|pages=97–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[iodine]] is formed as a [[fission product]] which depending on the nature of the fuel can escape from the pellet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=4681711 Energy Citations Database (ECD) – Document #4681711]. Osti.gov (1971-07-01). Retrieved on 2011-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that iodine causes the rate of cracking in pressurised [[zircaloy]]-4 tubing to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S.Y. Park |author2=J.H. Kim |author3=M.H. Lee |author4=Y.H. Jeong |title=Stress-corrosion crack initiation and propagation behavior of Zircaloy-4 cladding under an iodine environment|journal=Journal of Nuclear Materials|volume=372|issue=2–3|pages=293|year=2007|doi=10.1016/j.jnucmat.2007.03.258|bibcode = 2008JNuM..372..293P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphite moderated reactors===
In the cases of [[carbon dioxide]] cooled [[graphite]] [[moderated]] reactors such as [[magnox]] and [[advanced gas-cooled reactor|AGR]] power reactors an important [[corrosion]] reaction is the reaction of a [[molecule]] of [[carbon dioxide]] with graphite ([[carbon]]) to form two molecules of [[carbon monoxide]]. This is one of the processes which limits the working life of this type of reactor.

===Water-cooled reactors===

====Corrosion====
In a water-cooled reactor the action of [[radiation]] on the water ([[radiolysis]]) forms [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[oxygen]]. These can cause [[stress corrosion cracking]] of metal parts which include [[fuel]] cladding and other pipework. To mitigate this [[hydrazine]] and [[hydrogen]] are injected into a [[BWR]] or [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]] primary cooling circuit as [[corrosion inhibitor]]s to adjust the [[redox]] properties of the system. A review of recent developments on this topic has been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3327/jnst.43.65 |author1=K. Ishida |author2=Y. Wada |author3=M. Tachibana |author4=M. Aizawa |author5=M. Fuse |author6=E. Kadoi |journal=Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology |year=2006 |title=Hydrazine and Hydrogen Co-injection to Mitigate Stress Corrosion Cracking of Structural Materials in Boiling Water Reactors, (I) Temperature Dependence of Hydrazine Reactions |volume=43 |pages=65–76 |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnst/43/1/65/_pdf |issue=1 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thermal stresses upon quenching====
In a [[loss-of-coolant accident]] (LOCA) it is thought that the surface of the cladding could reach a temperature between 800 and 1400&amp;nbsp;K, and the cladding will be exposed to [[steam]] for some time before water is reintroduced into the reactor to cool the fuel. During this time when the hot cladding is exposed to steam some oxidation of the [[zirconium]] will occur to form a [[zirconium oxide]] which is more zirconium rich than [[zirconia]]. This Zr(O) phase is the α-phase, further oxidation forms zirconia. The longer the cladding is exposed to steam the less ductile it will be. One measure of the ductility is to compress a ring along a diameter (at a constant rate of displacement, in this case 2&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) until the first crack occurs, then the ring will start to fail. The elongation which occurs between when the maximum force is applied and when the mechanical load is declined to 80% of the load required to induce the first crack is the L&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt; value in mm. The more ductile a sample is the greater this L&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt; value will be.

In one experiment the zirconium is heated in steam to 1473 K, the sample is slowly cooled in steam to 1173&amp;nbsp;K before being quenched in water. As the heating time at 1473&amp;nbsp;K is increased the zirconium becomes more brittle and the L&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt; value declines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3327/jnst.43.844|author1=Y. Udagawa |author2=F. Nagase  |author3=T. Fuketa |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Effect of Cooling History on Cladding Ductility under LOCA Conditions|journal=Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology|year=2006|volume=43|issue=8|pages=844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aging of steels===
[[Irradiation]] causes the properties of steels to become poorer, for instance [[stainless steel|SS316]] becomes less [[ductile]] and less [[Toughness|tough]]. Also [[creep (deformation)|creep]] and [[stress corrosion cracking]] become worse. Papers on this effect continue to be published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3327/jnst.43.159 |author1=K. Fukuya |author2=K. Fujii |author3=H. Nishioka |author4=Y. Kitsunai |journal=Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology |year=2006 |volume=43 |pages=159–173 |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnst/43/2/159/_pdf |title=Evolution of Microstructure and Microchemistry in Cold-worked 316 Stainless Steels under PWR Irradiation |issue=2 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cracking and overheating of the fuel==
This is due to the fact that as the fuel [[thermal expansion|expands on heating]], the core of the pellet expands more than the rim. Because of the [[thermal stress]] thus formed the fuel cracks, the cracks tend to go from the center to the edge in a star shaped pattern. A [[PhD thesis]] on the subject has been published&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nada.kth.se/utbildning/grukth/exjobb/rapportlistor/2004/rapporter04/othman_rozhgar_04051.pdf Microsoft Word – fuelReport.doc]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; by a student at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]] ([[Sweden]]).

The cracking of the fuel has an effect on the release of radioactivity from fuel both under accident conditions and also when the spent fuel is used as the final disposal form. The cracking increases the surface area of the fuel which increases the rate at which fission products can leave the fuel.

The temperature of the fuel varies as a function of the distance from the center to the rim. At distance ''x'' from the center the temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) is described by the [[equation]] where ρ is the power density (W&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) and K&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[thermal conductivity]].

T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;Rim&lt;/sub&gt; + ρ (r&lt;sub&gt;pellet&lt;/sub&gt;² – ''x''²) (4 K&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

To explain this for a series of fuel pellets being used with a rim temperature of 200&amp;nbsp;°C (typical for a [[BWR]]) with different [[diameters]] and power densities of 250&amp;nbsp;Wm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; have been modeled using the above equation. These fuel pellets are rather large; it is normal to use oxide pellets which are about 10&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.

&lt;gallery widths="400" heights="300"&gt;
File:rim200pd250rad1000fueltemp.png|Temperature profile for a 20&amp;nbsp;mm diameter fuel pellet with a power density of 250&amp;nbsp;W per cubic meter. The central temperature is very different for the different fuel solids.
File:rim200pd250rad1300fueltemp.png|Temperature profile for a 26&amp;nbsp;mm diameter fuel pellet with a power density of 250&amp;nbsp;W per cubic meter.
File:rim200pd250rad1600fueltemp.png|Temperature profile for a 32&amp;nbsp;mm diameter fuel pellet with a power density of 250&amp;nbsp;W per cubic meter.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

To show the effects of different power densities on the centerline temperatures two graphs for 20&amp;nbsp;mm pellets at different power levels are shown below. It is clear that for all pellets (and most true of uranium dioxide) that for a given sized pellet that a limit must be set on the [[power density]]. It is likely that the maths used for these calculations would be used to explain how electrical [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] function and also it could be used to predict the centerline temperature in any system where heat is released throughout a cylinder shaped object.&lt;ref&gt;''Radiochemistry and Nuclear Chemistry'', G. Choppin, J-O Liljenzin and J. Rydberg, 3rd Ed, 2002, Butterworth-Heinemann, {{ISBN|0-7506-7463-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Loss of volatile fission products from pellets===
The heating of pellets can result in some of the [[fission products]] being lost from the core of the pellet. If the xenon can rapidly leave the pellet then the amount of &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs and &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs which is present in the gap between the [[Cladding (nuclear fuel)|cladding]] and the fuel will increase. As a result, if the [[zircaloy]] tubes holding the pellet are broken then a greater release of radioactive caesium from the fuel will occur. It is important to understand that the &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs and &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs are formed in different ways, and hence as a result the two caesium isotopes can be found at different parts of a fuel pin.

It is clear that the volatile [[iodine]] and [[xenon]] isotopes have minutes in which they can diffuse out of the pellet and into the gap between the fuel and the cladding. Here the xenon can decay to the long lived caesium isotope.

====Genesis of &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs====
In the case of [[caesium-134|&lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] the precursor to this isotope is stable &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs which is formed by the decay of much longer lived xenon and iodine isotopes. No &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is formed without [[neutron activation]] as &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Xe is a stable isotope. As a result of this different mode of formation the physical location of &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs can differ from that of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs.

===An example of a recent PIE study===
In a recent study, used 20% enriched uranium dispersed in a range of different matrices was examined to determine the physical locations of different isotopes and chemical elements.

* A [[solid solution]] of [[Uranium dioxide|urania]] in [[yttria-stabilized zirconia]] (YSZ) (Y:Zr atom ratio of 1:4).
* [[Uranium dioxide|Urania]] particles in an inert matrix formed by a mixture of YSZ and [[spinel]] (MgAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).
* Urania particles dispersed in the inert matrix formed by a mixture of YSZ and [[alumina]].

The fuels varied in their ability to retain the fission [[xenon]]; the first of the three fuels retained 97% of the [[xenon-133|&lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Xe]], the second retained 94% while the last fuel only retained 76% of this xenon isotope. The &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Xe is a long-lived radioactive isotope which can diffuse slowly out of the pellet before being [[neutron activation|neutron activated]] to form [[caesium-134|&lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]]. The more short-lived [[xenon-137|&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Xe]] was less able to leach out of the pellets; 99%, 98% and 95% of the &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Xe was retained within the pellets. It was also found that the [[caesium-137|&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] concentration in the core of the pellet was much lower than the concentration in the rim of the pellet, while the less volatile [[ruthenium-106|&lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Ru]] was spread more evenly throughout the pellets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jnucmat.2006.03.002|author1=N.

The following fuel is particles of [[solid solution]] of urania in [[yttria-stabilized zirconia]] dispersed in [[alumina]] which had [[burnup|burnt up]] to 105&amp;nbsp;GW-days per cubic meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0022-3115(03)00140-5|author1=N.

It can be seen that the [[fission products]] are well confined to within the fuel, little of the fission products have entered the alumina matrix. The [[neodymium]] is spread throughout the fuel in a uniform manner, while the [[caesium]] is almost homogenously spread out throughout the fuel. The caesium concentration is slightly higher at two points where xenon bubbles are present. Much of the xenon is present in bubbles, while almost all of the [[ruthenium]] is present in the form of [[nanoparticle]]s. The ruthenium nanoparticles are not always colocated with the xenon bubbles.

==Release of fission products into coolant water in a Three Mile Island type accident==
At [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] a recently [[SCRAM]]ed core was starved of cooling water, as a result of the [[decay heat]] the core dried out and the fuel was damaged. Attempts were made to recool the core using water. According to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] for a 3,000&amp;nbsp;MW(t) [[pressurized water reactor|PWR]] the normal coolant radioactivity levels are shown below in the table, and the coolant activities for reactors which have been allowed to dry out (and over heat) before being recovered with water. In a gap release the activity in the fuel/cladding gap has been released while in the core melt release the core was melted before being recovered by water.&lt;ref&gt;Generic assessment procedures for determining protective actions during a reactor accident, International Atomic Energy Agency technical document 955, published in [[Austria]] August 1997 ISSN 1011-4289, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chernobyl release==
The release of radioactivity from the used fuel is greatly controlled by the volatility of the elements. At [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] much of the [[xenon]] and [[iodine]] was released while much less of the [[zirconium]] was released. The fact that only the more volatile fission products are released with ease will greatly retard the release of radioactivity in the event of an accident which causes serious damage to the core. Using two sources of data it is possible to see that the elements which were in the form of gases, volatile compounds or semi-volatile compounds (such as CsI) were released at Chernobyl while the less volatile elements which form solid solutions with the fuel remained inside the reactor fuel.

According to the [[OECD]] NEA report on Chernobyl (ten years on),&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.nea.fr/html/rp/chernobyl/allchernobyl.html Chernobyl 10 years on – An Assessment by the NEA Committee on Radiation Protection and Public Health, November 1995]. Nea.fr. Retrieved on 2011-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; the following proportions of the core inventory were released. The [[physics|physical]] and [[chemical]] forms of the release included [[gases]], [[aerosols]] and finely fragmented solid fuel. According to some research the [[ruthenium]] is very mobile when the nuclear fuel is heated with air.&lt;ref&gt;Zoltán Hózer, Lajos Matus, Oleg Prokopiev, Bálint Alföldy and Mrs Anna Csordás-Tóth [http://web.nmsu.edu/~prokop/pub/ru.pdf ESCAPE RUTHENIUM WITH HIGH TEMPERATURE AIR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709114956/http://web.nmsu.edu/~prokop/pub/ru.pdf |date=2011-07-09 }}, KFKI Atomic Energy Research Institute, November, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The releases of [[fission products]] and uranium from uranium dioxide (from spent [[BWR]] fuel, [[burnup]] was 65 GWd t&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) which was heated in a [[Martin Knudsen|Knudsen]] cell has been repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jnucmat.2005.09.024|author1=J.Y.

It was found even for the [[noble gas]]es that a high temperature was required to liberate them from the uranium oxide solid. For unoxidized fuel 2300&amp;nbsp;K was required to release 10% of the uranium while oxidized fuel only requires 1700&amp;nbsp;K to release 10% of the uranium.

According to the report on Chernobyl used in the above table 3.5% of the following isotopes in the core were released &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Np, &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu, &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu, &lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Pu, &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Pu and &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm.

==Degradation of the whole fuel element==
Water and [[zirconium]] can react violently at 1200&amp;nbsp;°C, at the same temperature the [[zircaloy]] [[Cladding (nuclear fuel)|cladding]] can react with uranium dioxide to form [[zirconium oxide]] and a uranium/zirconium [[alloy]] melt.&lt;ref name=mrs/&gt;

===PHEBUS===
In France a facility exists in which a fuel melting incident can be made to happen under strictly controlled conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irsn.org/va/09_int/09_int_3_lib/pdf/Ra_sc_tech/008_015.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613195826/http://www.irsn.org/va/09_int/09_int_3_lib/pdf/Ra_sc_tech/008_015.pdf |date=June 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irsn.org/va/04_act/04_act_1/04_act_communiques_irsn/04_act_communiques_irsn_2003/04_act_030625.shtm |title=IRSN - PHEBUS FP: A major international research program in the nuclear safety field |publisher= |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121193932/http://www.irsn.org/va/04_act/04_act_1/04_act_communiques_irsn/04_act_communiques_irsn_2003/04_act_030625.shtm |archivedate=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the PHEBUS research program fuels have been allowed to heat up to temperatures in excess of the normal operating temperatures, the fuel in question is in a special channel which is in a toroidal nuclear reactor. The nuclear reactor is used as a ''driver core'' to irradate the test fuel. While the reactor is cooled as normal by its own cooling system the test fuel has its own cooling system, which is fitted with filters and equipment to study the release of radioactivity from the damaged fuel. Already the release of radioisotopes from fuel under different conditions has been studied. After the fuel has been used in the experiment it is subject to a detailed examination ([[Post Irradiation Examination|PIE]]), In the 2004 annual report from the [[Institute for Transuranium Elements|ITU]] some results of the PIE on PHEBUS (FPT2) fuel are reported in section 3.6.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itu.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/media/Activity_Report_2004.pdf "ITU04_Vorspann_end].

===LOFT===
The '''Loss of Fluid Tests (LOFT)''' were an early attempt to scope the response of real nuclear fuel to conditions under a [[loss-of-coolant accident]], funded by [[USNRC]]. The facility was built at [[Idaho National Laboratory]], and was essentially a scale-model of a commercial [[pressurized water reactor|PWR]]. ('Power/volume scaling' was used between the LOFT model, with a 50MWth core, and a commercial plant of 3000MWth).

The original intention (1963–1975) was to study only one or two major (large break) [[LOCA (nuclear)|LOCA]], since these had been the main concern of US 'rule-making' hearings in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These rules had focussed around a rather stylised large-break accident, and a set of criteria (e.g. for extent of fuel-clad oxidation) set out in 'Appendix K' of 10CFR50 (Code of Federal Regulations). Following the accident at [[Three Mile Island]], detailed modelling of much smaller LOCA became of equal concern.

38 LOFT tests were eventually performed and their scope was broadened to study a wide spectrum of breach sizes. These tests were used to help validate a series of computer codes (such as RELAP-4, RELAP-5 and TRAC) then being developed to calculate the thermal-hydraulics of LOCA.

==Contact of molten fuel with water and concrete==

===Water===
Extensive work was done from 1970 to 1990 on the possibility of a [[steam explosion]] or FCI when molten '[[corium (nuclear reactor)|corium]]' contacted water. Many experiments suggested quite low conversion of thermal to mechanical energy, whereas the theoretical models available appeared to suggest that much higher efficiencies were possible. A [[Nuclear Energy Agency|NEA]]/[[OECD]] report was written on the subject in 2000 which states that a steam explosion caused by contact of corium with water has four stages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.fr/html/nsd/docs/1999/csni-r99-24.pdf TECHNICAL OPINION PAPER ON FUEL-COOLANT INTERACTION], NUCLEAR ENERGY AGENCY COMMITTEE ON THE SAFETY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS, November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

* Premixing
**As the jet of corium enters the water, it breaks up into droplets. During this stage the thermal contact between the corium and the water is not good because a vapor film surrounds the droplets of corium and this insulates the two from each other. It is possible for this ''meta''-stable state to quench without an explosion or it can trigger in the next step
* Triggering
**A externally or internally generated trigger (such as a [[pressure wave]]) causes a collapse of the vapor film between the corium and the water.
* Propagation
**The local increase in pressure due to the increased heating of the water can generate enhanced [[heat transfer]] (usually due to rapid fragmentation of the hot fluid within the colder more volatile one) and a greater pressure wave, this process can be self-sustained. (The mechanics of this stage would then be similar to those in a classical [[ZND detonation wave]]).
* Expansion
**This process leads to the whole of the water being suddenly heated to boiling. This causes an increase in pressure (in layman's terms, an explosion), which can result in damage to the plant.

==Lava flows from corium==

The [[corium (nuclear reactor)|corium]] (molten core) will cool and change to a solid with time. It is thought that the solid is weathering with time. The solid can be described as ''Fuel Containing Mass'', it is a mixture of [[sand]], [[zirconium]] and [[uranium dioxide]] which had been heated at a very high temperature&lt;ref&gt;[http://ph.icmp.lviv.ua/chornobyl/e-library/tarapon-modeli_procesiv/Summary.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926151542/http://ph.icmp.lviv.ua/chornobyl/e-library/tarapon-modeli_procesiv/Summary.htm |date=September 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until it has melted. The chemical nature of this ''FCM'' has been the subject of some research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Teterin |url=http://www.maik.rssi.ru/abstract/radchem/1/radchem0596_abstract.pdf |journal=Radiochemistry |first1=Yu.

The Chernobyl melt was a [[silicate]] melt which did contain inclusions of [[zirconium|Zr]]/[[uranium|U]] phases, molten [[steel]] and high uranium [[zirconium silicate]]. The lava flow consists of more than one type of material—a brown lava and a porous ceramic material have been found.
The uranium to zirconium for different parts of the solid differs a lot, in the brown lava a uranium rich phase with a U:Zr ratio of 19:3 to about 38:10 is found. The uranium poor phase in the brown lava has a U:Zr ratio of about 1:10.&lt;ref name=mrs&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S.V. Ushakov |author2=B.E. Burakov |author3=S.I. Shabalev |author4=E.B.

It can be shown that before the explosion that in part of the core the temperature was higher than 2000&amp;nbsp;°C, while in some areas the temperature was over 2400–2600&amp;nbsp;°C.

==Spent fuel corrosion==

===Uranium dioxide films===

[[Uranium dioxide]] films can be deposited by [[Sputter deposition#Reactive sputtering|reactive sputtering]] using an [[argon]] and [[oxygen]] mixture at a low [[pressure]]. This has been used to make a layer of the uranium oxide on a [[gold]] surface which was then studied with [[impedance spectroscopy|AC impedance spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0022-3115(01)00650-X|author1=F.

===Noble metal nanoparticles and hydrogen===

According to the work of the [[corrosion]] [[electrochemistry|electrochemist]] Shoesmith&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwo.ca/chem/people/faculty/shoesmith.htm faculty-Shoesmith]. Uwo.ca. Retrieved on 2011-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[nanoparticle]]s of [[molybdenum|Mo]]-[[technetium|Tc]]-[[ruthenium|Ru]]-[[palladium|Pd]] have a strong effect on the corrosion of [[uranium dioxide]] fuel. For instance his work suggests that when the hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) concentration is high (due to the [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] corrosion of the [[steel]] waste can) the oxidation of hydrogen at the nanoparticles will exert a protective effect on the uranium dioxide. This effect can be thought of as an example of protection by a [[sacrificial anode]] where instead of a metal [[anode]] reacting and dissolving it is the hydrogen gas which is consumed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4515">'''CarbonCast''' is a [[precast concrete]] technology that uses [[carbon (fibre)|carbon-fibre]] grid as secondary reinforcing or as a shear truss. It was introduced by [[AltusGroup, Inc.]], a North American partnership of 17 precast concrete manufacturers and seven industry suppliers founded to expedite the research and national commercialization of concrete innovations.

==Products==

The CarbonCast line of commercial products includes:
* '''CarbonCast High Performance Insulated Wall Panels''' are composed of two concrete wythes separated by continuous insulation and connected by C-GRID carbon fibre shear trusses&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edcmag.com/Articles/Products/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000116136 Insulated Wall Panels], retrieved 2010-06-09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleID=436 New Carbon Fibre Reinforcement Advances Sandwich Wall Panels] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201022315/http://www.structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleID=436 |date=December 1, 2010 }}, retrieved 2010-06-10&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''CarbonCast Insulated Architectural Cladding''' feature inner and outer wythes 1-3⁄4″thick or more for a total concrete thickness of 3-1⁄2″. The wythes sandwich a layer of insulation of usually 2″ or more depending on [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] requirements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildings.com/Magazine/ArticleDetails/tabid/3413/ArticleID/9813/Default.aspx CarbonCast by AltusGroup] retrieved 2010-06-10&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''CarbonCast Architectural Cladding''' employs a steel reinforced Vierendeel-like truss frame attached to a thin, C-GRID reinforced diaphragm face. Insulating foam forms around patented V-ribs, designed to create a thermal break with the face of the panel, and displaces concrete to provide insulation while C-GRID carbon fibre shear trusses mechanically link the face and truss ribs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gostructural.com/magazine-article----building_a_better_sandwich-4331.html Building a better sandwich] retrieved 2010-06-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facilitiesnet.com/buildingproducts/details.asp?ProductID=4150 Cladding] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710220137/http://www.facilitiesnet.com/buildingproducts/details.asp?ProductID=4150 |date=July 10, 2011 }} retrieved 2010-06-10&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''CarbonCast Double Tees''' replace conventional steel mesh reinforcing in the flange with C-GRID carbon fibre grid&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parkingtoday.com/articledetails.php?id=357 Jet Fighters and Golf Clubs: Similar to Parking Garages?], retrieved 2010-06-10&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==

The use of carbon fibre grid over conventional reinforcement yields a number of unique properties to CarbonCast components:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edcmag.com/Articles/Products/a20e37e14c697010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0____ Precast Concrete Technology Reduces Weight, Improves Insulation], retrieved 2010-06-19&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lower weight - When carbon fibre grid replaces steel mesh in the face of concrete products, manufacturers can use less concrete cover to protect the mesh from corrosive elements. Non-corrosive carbon fibre eliminates the need for extra concrete.
* Improved thermal performance - The relatively low [[thermal conductivity]] of carbon fibre permits CarbonCast components to provide higher R-values than conventional precast concrete.
* Improved strength - Carbon fibre is four times stronger than steel by weight providing better surface crack control when used as secondary reinforcing and 100% composite action when used as a truss in insulated wall panels.
* Comparable cost - Many applications receive savings in foundation and superstructure (reduced weight), energy costs (insulation) and maintenance (reduced corrosion).

== Applications ==

There are more than 700 projects totaling more than {{convert|30000000|sqft|m2}} of surface area of CarbonCast technology in these markets:
* Education
* Industrial / Warehouse
* Commercial Office
* Parking Structure
* Multi-Family Residential
* Retail

== Examples ==

Prominent structures that have used CarbonCast technology include:

* [[Proximity Hotel]], Greensboro, NC
* [[Lucas Oil Stadium]], Indianapolis, IN 
* University Commons at [[Georgia State University]], Atlanta, GA

'''Carbon retirement''' involves retiring allowances from [[Emissions_trading#Trading_systems|emission trading schemes]] as a method for offsetting carbon emissions. Under schemes such as the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]], EU Emission Allowances (EUAs) represent the right to release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and are issued to all the largest polluters. Buying these allowances and permanently removing them forces industrial companies to reduce their emissions. Over time, the scheme will offer fewer allowances, making it much harder for industrial companies to sustain high emission levels without incurring financial penalties.

Unlike [[Carbon_offset#Sources_of_carbon_offsets|traditional offsetting projects]], retirement is straightforward and transparent. There are no complex projects, methodologies, brokers or intermediaries and the issue of [[Additionality#Additionality_and_its_importance|additionality]] is overcome.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3588">[[File:Chat pile near Picher, Okla..jpg|thumb|This image, taken in 2010, shows a chat pile near [[Picher, Oklahoma]]. These piles contain lead-contaminated dust and are part of the reasons the area is designated as the [[Tar Creek Superfund site]].]]

'''Chat''' is a term for fragments of [[siliceous rock]], [[limestone]], and [[dolomite]] waste rejected in the lead-zinc milling operations that accompanied [[lead]]-[[zinc]] mining in the first half of the 20th century. Historic lead and zinc mining in the [[Midwestern United States]] was centered in two major areas: the [[Tri-State area]] covering more than {{convert|2500|sqmi|km2}} in southwestern [[Missouri]], southeastern [[Kansas]], and northeastern [[Oklahoma]] and the Old [[Lead Belt]] covering about {{convert|110|sqmi|km2}} in southeastern Missouri. The first recorded mining occurred in the Old Lead Belt in about 1742. The production increased significantly in both the Tri-state area and the Old Lead Belt during the mid-19th century and lasted up to 1970.

==Cleanup==
Currently production still occurs in a third area, the [[Viburnum, Missouri|Viburnum]] Trend, in southeastern Missouri. Mining and milling of ore produced more than 500 million tons of wastes in the Tri-State area and about 250 million tons of wastes in the Old Lead Belt. More than 75 percent of this waste has been removed, with some portion of it used over the years. Today, approximately 100 million tons of chat remain in the Tri-State area. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], the states of Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, local communities, and private companies continue to work together in implementing and monitoring
response actions that reduce or remove potential adverse impacts posed by remaining mine wastes contaminated with lead, zinc, [[cadmium]], and other metals.

==Ore processing==
Ore production consisted of crushing and grinding the rock to standard sizes and separating the ore. Ore processing was accomplished in either a dry gravity separation or through a wet washing or flotation separation. Dry processes produced a fine gravel waste commonly called “chat.” The wet processes resulted in the creation of [[tailing ponds]] used to dispose of waste material after ore separation. The wastes from wet
separation are typically sand and silt size and are called “[[tailings]].” Milling produces large chat waste piles and flat areas with tailings deposited in impoundments. Tailings generally contain higher concentrations of [[heavy metals]] and therefore present a higher risk to human health and the environment through direct contact. Chat typically ranges in diameter from 1/4 to 5/8&amp;nbsp;inch. Intermingled material such as sands
measure 0.033-0.008&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter and fine tailings are less than {{convert|0.008|in|mm}} in diameter.

==Uses==
Although poisonous, chat can be used to improve traction on snow-covered roads; as gravel; and as [[construction aggregate]], principally for railroad ballast, highway construction, and concrete production.

&lt;/ref&gt; the '''Coulomb gap''' is a soft gap in the Single-Particle [[Density of states|Density of States]]  (DOS) of a system of interacting localized electrons.
Due to the long-range Coulomb interactions, the single-particle DOS vanishes at the chemical potential, at low enough temperatures, such that thermal excitations do not wash out the gap.

== Theory ==
At zero temperature, a classical treatment of a system gives an upper bound for the DOS near the [[Fermi]]-energy, first suggested by [[Alexei L. Efros|Efros]] and [[Boris Shklovskii|Shklovskii]].&lt;ref name="EfrosShklovskii1"&gt;A L Efros and B I Shklovskii , J. Phys. C8, L49 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is as follows:
Let us look at the [[ground state]] configuration of the system. Defining &lt;math&gt; E_i &lt;/math&gt; as the energy of an [[electron]] at site &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, due to the disorder and the Coulomb interaction with all other electrons (we define this both for occupied and unoccupied sites), it is easy to see that the energy needed to move an electron from an occupied site &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; to an unoccupied site &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt; is given by the expression:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E=E_j-E_i-e^2/r_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;.
The subtraction of the last term accounts for the fact that &lt;math&gt; E_j &lt;/math&gt; contains a term due to the interaction with the electron present at site &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, but after moving the electron this term should not be considered. It is easy to see from this that there exists an energy &lt;math&gt; E_f &lt;/math&gt; such that all sites with energies above it are empty, and below it are full (this is the Fermi energy, but since we are dealing with a system with interactions it is not obvious a-priori that it is still well-defined).
Assume we have a finite single-particle DOS at the Fermi energy, &lt;math&gt; g(E_f) &lt;/math&gt;. For every possible transfer of an electron from an occupied site i to an unoccupied site j, the energy invested should be positive, since we are assuming we are in the ground state of the system, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&gt;=0 &lt;/math&gt;.
Assuming we have a large system, let us consider all the sites with energies in the interval &lt;math&gt; [E_f-\epsilon, E_f+\epsilon].  &lt;/math&gt; The number of these, by assumption, is  &lt;math&gt;  N= 2 \epsilon g(E_f).  &lt;/math&gt; As explained, &lt;math&gt; N/2&lt;/math&gt; of these would be occupied, and the others unoccupied. Of all pairs of occupied and unoccupied sites, let us choose the one where the two are closest to each other. If we assume the sites are randomly distributed in space, we find that the distance between these two sites is of order:
&lt;math&gt;  R \sim (N/V)^{-1/d} &lt;/math&gt;, where d is the dimension of space.
Plugging the expression for &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; into the previous equation, we obtain the inequality:
&lt;math&gt; E_j-E_i-C e^2 (\epsilon g(E_f)/V)^{1/d} &gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; C&lt;/math&gt; is a coefficient of order unity. Since  &lt;math&gt; E_j-E_i &lt;2\epsilon &lt;/math&gt;, this inequality will necessarily be violated for small enough &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;. Hence, assuming a finite DOS at &lt;math&gt; E_f &lt;/math&gt; led to a contradiction. Repeating the above calculation under the assumption that the DOS near &lt;math&gt; E_f &lt;/math&gt; is proportional to &lt;math&gt; (E-E_f)^\alpha &lt;/math&gt; shows that &lt;math&gt; \alpha&gt;=d-1 &lt;/math&gt;.  This is an upper bound for the Coulomb gap. Efros &lt;ref&gt;A. L. Efros, J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys 9, 2021 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; considered single electron excitations, and obtained an integro-differential equation for the DOS, showing the Coulomb gap in fact  follows the above equation (i.e., the upper bound is a tight bound).

Other treatments of the problem include a mean-field numerical approach,&lt;ref&gt;M. Grunewald, B. Pohlmann, L. Schweitzer, and D.Wurtz,J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys., 15, L1153 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as more recent treatments such as,&lt;ref&gt;M. Muller and S. Pankov, Phys. Rev. B. 75, 144201 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; also verifying the upper bound suggested above is a tight bound. Many Monte-Carlo simulations were also performed,&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Davies, P. A. Lee, and T. M. Rice, Phys. Rev. Lett. 49, 758 - 761 (1982)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Mobius, M. Richter, and B. Drittler, Phys. Rev. B 45, 11568 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;  some of them in disagreement with the result quoted above. Few works deal with the quantum aspect of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;G. Vignale, Phys. Rev. B 36, 8192(1987)
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimental observations ==

Direct experimental confirmation of the gap has been done via tunneling experiments, which probed the single-particle DOS in two and three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Massey and M. Lee, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 4266 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Y. Butko, J. F. Ditusa, and P. W. Adams, Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 1543 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments clearly showed a linear gap in two-dimensions, and a parabolic gap in three-dimensions.
Another experimental consequence of the Coulomb gap is found in the conductivity of samples in the localized regime.
The existence of a gap in the spectrum of excitations would result in a lowered conductivity than that predicted by [[Variable range hopping|Mott Variable range hopping]]. If one uses the analytical expression of the Single-Particle DOS in the Mott derivation, a universal &lt;math&gt; e^{-1/T^{1/2}} &lt;/math&gt; is obtained, for any dimension.&lt;ref&gt;B. Shklovskii and A. Efros, Electronic properties of doped
semiconductors (Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; The observation of this is expected to occur below a certain temperature, such that the optimal energy of hopping would be smaller than the width of the Coulomb gap. The transition from Mott to so-called Efros-Shklovskii Variable Range Hopping has been observed experimentally for various systems.&lt;ref&gt;A. Y. Rogatchev and U. Mizutani, Phys. Rev. B. 61, 15550
(2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, no rigorous derivation of the Efros-Shklovskii conductivity formula has been put forth, and in some experiments &lt;math&gt; e^{-1/T^{\alpha}} &lt;/math&gt; behavior is observed, for alpha which fits neither the Mott nor the Efros-Shklovskii theories.

[[File:Unfinished Crimea Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine (8).jpg|thumb|upright|Abandoned Crimean Atomic Energy Station]]
The '''Crimean Nuclear Power Station''' ({{lang-uk|Кримська АЕС}}; {{lang-ru|Крымская АЭС}}) is an abandoned and unfinished [[nuclear power plant]] near the cape of [[Kazantyp]] on banks of [[Aqtas Lake]] in [[Crimea]] ([[Ukraine]]/[[Russia]]). 

==History==
Construction work on the plant started in 1976, and the nearby town of [[Shcholkine]] was constructed in 1978 to house workers working on the project. The station was inspected following the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986, and was found to be located on a geologically volatile site. Construction of the facility was summarily abandoned in 1989.

Between 1993 and 1999 the plant was home to the electronic music festival [[Kazantip]]. The festival was referred to as the "Reaktor" for this  reason.

From 1998 to 2004 the station was under jurisdiction of the Ministry of Fuel (Ukraine). In 2004 it was passed to the government of Crimea. In 2005 the Crimean representation of the State Property Fund sold the station to an undisclosed firm.

The '''Enhanced Fujita scale''' ('''EF-Scale''') rates the intensity of [[tornado]]es in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] based on the damage they cause.

Implemented in place of the [[Fujita scale]] introduced in 1971 by [[Ted Fujita|Tetsuya Theodore Fujita]], it began operational use in the United States on February 1, 2007, followed by Canada on April 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/f-scale.html NOAA: Fujita Tornado Damage Scale]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tornadofacts.net/tornado-scale.php Tornado Damage Scales: Fujita Scale and Enhanced Fujita Scale]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Enhanced Fujita Scale | url = http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=41E875DA-1 | publisher = Environment Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale has the same basic design as the original Fujita scale—six categories from zero to five, representing increasing degrees of damage. It was revised to reflect better examinations of tornado damage surveys, so as to align wind speeds more closely with associated storm damage.  Better standardizing and elucidating what was previously subjective and ambiguous, it also adds more types of structures and vegetation, expands degrees of damage, and better accounts for variables such as differences in construction quality.

The newer scale was publicly unveiled by the [[National Weather Service]] at a conference of the [[American Meteorological Society]] in [[Atlanta]] on February 2, 2006. It was developed from 2000 to 2004 by the Fujita Scale Enhancement Project of the [[Wind Science and Engineering Research Center]] at [[Texas Tech University]], which brought together dozens of expert [[meteorologist]]s and [[civil engineer]]s in addition to its own resources.

As with the Fujita scale, the Enhanced Fujita scale remains a damage scale and only a proxy for actual wind speeds. While the wind speeds associated with the damage listed have not undergone empirical analysis (such as detailed physical or any numerical modeling) owing to excessive cost, the wind speeds were obtained through a process of [[expert elicitation]] based on various engineering studies since the 1970s as well as from field experience of meteorologists and engineers.  In addition to damage to structures and vegetation, radar data, [[photogrammetry]], and [[cycloidal]] marks (ground swirl patterns) may be utilized when available.

The scale was used for the first time in the United States a year after its public announcement when parts of central Florida were struck by [[2007 Central Florida tornadoes|multiple tornadoes]], the strongest of which were rated at EF3 on the new scale. It was used for the first time in Canada shortly after its implementation there when a tornado developed near the town on [[Shelburne, Ontario]] on April 18, 2013, causing up to EF1 damage.

==Parameters==
The six categories for the EF scale are listed below, in order of increasing intensity. Although the [[wind speed]]s and photographic damage examples are updated, the damage descriptions given are those from the Fujita scale, which are more or less still accurate. However, for the actual EF scale in practice, damage indicators (the type of structure which has been damaged) are predominantly used in determining the tornado intensity.&lt;ref name="SPC EF Scale"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale)| publisher = Storm Prediction Center| date = February 2, 2007| url = http://www.spc.noaa.gov/efscale/| accessdate = June 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damage indicators and degrees of damage===
The EF scale currently has 28 damage indicators (DI), or types of structures and vegetation, each with a varying number of degrees of damage (DoD).  Larger degrees of damage done to the damage indicators correspond to higher wind speeds.&lt;ref name="EF-Scale"&gt;{{cite book|last=McDonald|first=James|authorlink=James R. McDonald|author2=Kishor C.

==Differences from the Fujita scale==
The new scale takes into account quality of construction and standardizes different kinds of structures. The wind speeds on the original scale were deemed by meteorologists and engineers as being too high, and engineering studies indicated that slower winds than initially estimated cause the respective degrees of damage. &lt;ref&gt;Wind Science and Engineering Center. (2006). ''A recommendation for an enhanced Fujita scale (EF-scale).'' Retrieved from National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center website &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.spc.noaa.gov&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;The old scale lists an F5 tornado as wind speeds of {{convert|261|-|318|mph|abbr=on|0}}, while the new scale lists an EF5 as a tornado with winds above {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on|0}}, found to be sufficient to cause the damage previously ascribed to the F5 range of wind speeds. None of the tornadoes recorded on or before January 31, 2007, will be re-categorized.

Essentially, there is no functional difference in how tornadoes are rated. The old ratings and new ratings are smoothly connected with a linear formula. The only differences are adjusted wind speeds, measurements of which were not used in previous ratings, and refined damage descriptions; this is to standardize ratings and to make it easier to rate tornadoes which strike few structures. Twenty-eight Damage Indicators (DI), with descriptions such as "double-wide [[mobile home]]" or "[[strip mall]]", are used along with Degrees of Damage (DOD) to determine wind estimates. Different structures, depending on their building materials and ability to survive high winds, have their own DIs and DODs. Damage descriptors and wind speeds will also be readily updated as new information is learned.&lt;ref name="EF-Scale"/&gt;

Since the new system still uses actual tornado damage and similar degrees of damage for each category to estimate the storm's wind speed, the National Weather Service states that the new scale will likely not lead to an increase in a number of tornadoes classified as EF5. Additionally, the upper bound of the wind speed range for EF5 is open—in other words, there is no maximum wind speed designated.&lt;ref name="SPC EF Scale"/&gt;

'''Eskom Uganda Limited''' (EUL) is the largest generator of energy in [[Uganda]] and was incorporated in 2002 for a 20 year concession under a government regulatory framework.&lt;ref name="Sold"/&gt;

==Location==

EUL was formed in November 2002, following a successful bid to operate Nalubaale Power Station, the only existing power plant owned by the government at that time. Later, when the [[Kiira Hydroelectric Power Station]] came online in 2003, the [[Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited]] contracted it to EUL as well.&lt;ref name="Ten"&gt;{{cite web | title=Uganda's Generation Powerhouse: Eskom Uganda - Company Profile | date=21 November 2013 | accessdate=16 February 2016 | first=Tony |
url=http://www.euroasiaindustry.com/article/uganda-s-generation-powerhouse | last=White | publisher=Euroasiaindustry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
EUL is responsible for operating, maintaining and repairing two government-owned hydroelectric power stations. The older station, [[Nalubaale Hydroelectric Power Station|Nalubaale]], which opened in 1954, has 18 generators with a capacity of 10 megawatts each. The newer station, [[Kiira Hydroelectric Power Station|Kiira]], has five generators with a capacity of 40 megawatts each. The power generated is sold to the [[Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited]] (UETCL), the sole authorized bulk purchaser. UETCL in turn sells it to [[Umeme]], the distributor, who in turn, sells it to end users.&lt;ref name="Ten"/&gt;

==Ownership==
Eskom Uganda Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Eskom]], the South African energy conglomerate .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=16 February 2016 | last=Eskom | location=Johannesburg | url=http://www.eskom.co.za/OurCompany/CompanyInformation/Pages/Company_Information_1.aspx | title=Eskom Holdings Limited: Company Information | publisher=[[Eskom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although fully owned by the South African parent company, EUL is allowed to exercise a wide degree of autonomy. Its chief executive officer reports directly to the board of Eskom Holdings Limited.&lt;ref name="Ten"/&gt;

The '''Evolutionary Air and space Global Laser Engagement''' ('''EAGLE''') is a [[missile defence]] plan being developed by the [[United States Air Force]].

The project is a combination of two separate [[missile defense]] efforts: the [[Aerospace Relay Mirror System]] and a new, high-altitude [[airship]].  The project is designed as a means to destroy enemy [[missile]]s before they would have the opportunity to hit targets on [[United States|American]] soil.  It involves using either ground-based, air-based or space-based [[laser]]s deflected off a massive airship (roughly 25 times the size of the [[Goodyear blimp]]) covered in mirrors that could destroy missiles but also [[satellite]]s or spacecraft in a [[low Earth orbit]].

The first tests of the airship were scheduled to begin in 2006. Its current status as of 2011 is unknown.

'''Forecast verification''' is a subfield of the [[climate science|climate]], [[atmospheric science|atmospheric]] and [[ocean science]]s dealing with validating, verifying and determining the [[predictive power]] of [[Numerical weather prediction|prognostic model forecasts]].  Because of the complexity of these models, forecast verification goes a good deal beyond simple measures of [[association (statistics)|statistical association]] or [[mean squared error|mean error]] calculations.

==Defining the problem==

To determine the value of a [[forecasting|forecast]], we need to measure it against some baseline, or minimally accurate forecast.  There are many types of forecast that, while producing impressive-looking [[forecast skill|skill scores]], are nonetheless naive.  A [[Weather_forecasting#Persistence|"persistence" forecast]] can still rival even those of the most sophisticated models.  An example is: "What is the weather going to be like today?  Same as it was yesterday."  This could be considered analogous to a [[scientific control|"control" experiment]].  Another example would be a [[climatology|climatological]] forecast: "What is the weather going to be like today?  The same as it was, on average, for all the previous days this time of year for the past 75 years".

The second example suggests a good method of normalizing a forecast before applying any skill measure.  Most weather situations will cycle, since the Earth is forced by a highly regular energy source.  A numerical weather model must accurately model both the seasonal cycle and (if finely resolved enough) the diurnal cycle.  This output, however, adds no information content, since the same cycles are easily predicted from climatological data.  Climatological cycles may be removed from both the model output and the "truth" data.  Thus, the skill score, applied afterward, is more meaningful.

One way of thinking about it is, "how much does the forecast reduce our ''uncertainty''?"  Tang et al. (2005) &lt;ref name="Tang_etal2005"&gt;
{{cite news | title=Reliability of ENSO Dynamical Predictions | author=Youmin Tang and Richard Kleeman and Andrew M. Moore | year=2005 | journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences | volume=62 | pages=1770–1791 | bibcode=2005JAtS...62.1770T | doi=10.1175/JAS3445.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
used the [[conditional entropy]] to characterize the uncertainty of [[ensemble forecasting|ensemble predictions]] of the [[El Nino-Southern Oscillation|El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
R \approx \sum p_i \ln \frac{p_i}{q_i}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is the ensemble distribution and ''q'' is the climatological distribution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5068">The '''global hectare''' (gha) is a measurement unit for the [[ecological footprint]] of people or activities and the [[biocapacity]] of the [[earth]] or its regions. One global hectare is the world's annual amount of biological production for human use and human waste assimilation, per hectare of biologically productive land and fisheries.

It measures production and consumption of different products. It starts with the total biological production and waste assimilation in the world, including crops, forests (both wood production and CO2 absorption), grazing and fishing.&lt;ref name="borucke2013"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Borucke |first=Michael |last2=Moore |first2=David |last3=Cranston |first3=Gemma |last4=Gracey |first4=Kyle |last5=Iha |first5=Katsunori |last6=Larson |first6=Joy |last7=Lazarus |first7=Elias |last8=Morales |first8=Juan Carlos |last9=Wackernagel |first9=Mathis |title=Accounting for demand and supply of the biosphere's regenerative capacity: The National Footprint Accounts’ underlying methodology and framework |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.08.005 |department=The Living Planet Report 2016 cites this paper to explain the "conversion from actual land areas to global hectares." |journal=Ecological Indicators |volume=24 |pages=518–533 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The total of these kinds of production, weighted by the richness of the land they use,&lt;ref name="borucke2013" /&gt; is divided by the number of hectares used. The calculation does not include [[desert]]s, [[glacier]]s, and the [[open ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/frequently_asked_questions/#method2|work=Footprint Basics|publisher=[[Global Footprint Network]]|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Global hectares per person" refers to the amount of production and waste assimilation per person on the planet. In 2012 there were approximately 12.2 billion global hectares of production and waste assimilation, averaging 1.7 global hectares per person.&lt;ref name="lpr2016"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/lpr_2016/ |title=Living Planet Report 2016 |last=WWF |publisher=WWF International |year=2016 |isbn=978-2-940529-40-7 |location=Gland, Switzerland |pages=77 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consumption totaled 20.1 billion global hectares or 2.8 global hectares per person, meaning about 65% more was consumed than produced. This is possible because there are natural reserves all around the globe that function as backup food, material and energy supplies, although only for a relatively short period of time. Due to rapid population growth, these reserves are being depleted at an ever increasing tempo. See [[Earth Overshoot Day]].

Opponents and defenders of the concept have discussed its strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref name="question"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Galli |first=Alessandro |last2=Giampietro |first2=Mario |last3=Goldfinger |first3=Steve |last4=Lazarus |first4=Elias |last5=Lin |first5=David |last6=Saltelli |first6=Andrea |last7=Wackernagel |first7=Mathis |last8=Müller |first8=Felix |title=Questioning the Ecological Footprint |url=http://www.andreasaltelli.eu/file/repository/footprint_PUBLISHED.pdf |journal=Ecological Indicators |volume=69 |pages=224–232 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.04.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The global hectare is a useful measure of biocapacity as it can convert things like [[Human#Diet|human dietary requirements]] into common units, which can show how many [[people]] a certain region on earth can sustain, assuming current [[technology|technologies]] and [[agriculture|agricultural]] methods. It can be used as a way of determining the relative carrying capacity of the earth.

Different hectares of land can provide different amounts of global hectares. For example, a hectare of lush area with high [[rainfall]] would scale higher in global hectares than would a hectare of desert.

It can also be used to show that consuming different foods may increase the earth's ability to support larger populations. To illustrate, [[meat production|producing meat]] generally requires more land and energy than what producing vegetables requires; sustaining a meat-based diet would require a less populated planet.

==Hectare equivalents==
On average, a global hectare can be produced in the area of a standard hectare. A [[hectare]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|k|t|ɛər}}; symbol '''ha''') is a unit of area equal to {{convert|10000|m2|sigfig=6}} (a square 100 metres on each side or 328 feet on each side), 2.471 acres, 0.01 square kilometers, 0.00386102 square miles, or one square [[hectometre]] (100 metres squared).

The '''Grohnde Nuclear Power Plant''' is located in [[Grohnde]] in the [[Hamelin-Pyrmont]] district in [[Lower Saxony]].  It has one reactor that uses 193 fuel assemblies and utilizes both [[enriched uranium]] and [[MOX fuel]]. In 1985, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990 and 1998 the reactor produced more net electricity for the respective year than any other reactor in the world.
The plant is of the [[pressurized water reactor]] type, using four water based coolant cycles, kept under high pressure. About 80,000&amp;nbsp;people live within {{convert|10|km}} of the plant and a total of more than a million people within {{convert|60|km}}. The next big city is [[Hanover]] {{convert|50|km}} away.

Meeting the following essential requirements of the Criteria List is a prerequisite for certification:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gruenerstromlabel.de/english/gruener-strom-certified-green-electricity/|title=The Grüner Strom Criteria List 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=Grüner Strom Certified Green Electricity|publisher=Grüner Strom Label e.V.|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/oekostrom-verschaerfte-kriterien-fuer-das-oekolabel-gruener.697.de.html?dram:article_id=310573|title=Ökostrom - Verschärfte Kriterien für das Ökolabel "Grüner Strom"|website=Deutschlandfunk|language=de-DE|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Electricity must be sourced 100 % from renewable energy (from already existing or new power plants).
* Electricity providers must use a fixed amount per sold kilowatt-hour to promote new renewable energy development. In the case of customers with a consumption of:
** Up to 10.000 kWh/year, 0.5 Euro-Cent per kWh
** Between 10,000 kWh and 100,000 kWh/year, 0.4 Euro-Cent per kWh
** Between 100,000 kWh and 3,000,000 kWh/year, 0.2 Euro-Cent per kWh
** More than 3.000.000 kWh/year, 0.1 Euro-Cent per kWh
*The ''Grüner Strom'' certification is not granted to companies directly involved in nuclear power plants or to operators of nuclear companies or to companies with ownership interests/capital stock in nuclear operating companies.
* The ''Grüner Strom'' certification is not granted to companies with new and direct ownership interests in existing or newly built coal-fired power plants, purchased after the Criteria List 2015 has taken effect.
* Renewable Energy Certificates/Credits are not accepted to prove fulfillment of the delivery obligation.
The funding amounts are mostly used to make financial contributions or to co-finance new green power generating plants that are eligible for support pursuant to the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) at the same time. But they are used for power plants generating electricity for direct sale and distribution as well. Also the funds can partly go to installations abroad and to energy efficiency measures and projects, including citizen energy projects, which are spurring the transformation of the energy system and the associated infrastructure. Electricity providers must report about the projects supported by certification on the Internet. In addition, successfully completed projects are listed on the GSL e.V. website. Over 70 power supply companies offer green electricity certified to the ''Grüner Strom'' criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gruenerstromlabel.de/gruener-strom/oekostrom-beziehen/|title=Providers from A to Z|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Grüner Strom Label e.V.

Up to now, thanks to the ''Grüner Strom'' certification model, over 1,000 new electricity-generating plants have been initiated. They cover all sources of renewable energy. In 2013 for example, about 2.5 million euros have been made available, some 80 % of which for renewable electricity generating plants (see table 1).

&lt;small&gt;* Because some ''Grüner Strom'' label users still are in the certification process the values shown are preliminary 2013 data. In all likelihood, the final data will be higher.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;** Most of the projects listed in the category “development cooperation“ are RE plants all the same. They are allocated to this category because they were installed in developing and transitional countries.&lt;/small&gt;

== ''Grünes Gas'': The Seal of Approval for Biogas ==
[[File:Gruenes Gas Label RGB transp web 1181.png|thumb|
''Grünes Gas'' Certification
]]
The ''Grünes Gas'' certification was launched in June 2013. The seal is awarded for gas products when the production, use and distribution of the biogas meet the requirements as set out in the Criteria List.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gruenerstromlabel.de/english/gruenes-gas-certified-biogas/|title=The Grünes Gas Criteria List|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Grüner Strom Label e.V Association|language=de|accessdate=2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include for example:
* Biogas must be sourced by environmentally friendly means (it is not permitted to turn precious habitats into monoculture for example).
* A strong focus on crop sequencing balance.
* It is not permitted to use problematic herbicides and fertilizers from factory farming.
* It is not permitted to use genetically engineered organisms in the production process.
* Certification requires biogas (biomethane) or sewage gas. Landfill gas is not accepted.
* Primarily, regional raw materials should be used (raw materials carried over distances beyond 50 km are judged negatively).
* Gas providers are transparent about the composition of their product (a minimum of 10 % certified biogas).
Conformity of suppliers and providers, producers and power supply companies is verified based on rating system credit points. Currently, ''Grünes Gas'' is the only seal of approval for biogas indicating endorsement by environmental organizations, including consumer information groups.

=== Data ===
Three biogas products have achieved the ''Grünes Gas'' certification since January 1,2014. Preliminary estimates suggest that some 12,500 consumers bought biogas, which was certified to the ''Grünes Gas'' standards. Gas sales were estimated at 120,200 MWh. Based on the annual average of total sales 14 % of the gas sales was biogas, i.e. the equivalent of some 16,830 MWh.&lt;ref&gt;The Grüner Strom Label e.V Association: Data as per October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''', also known as protonated [[hydrogen cyanide]], is a molecular ion of astrophysical interest.

== Structure ==

The ground state structure of HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is a simple linear molecule.  In addition, there are multiple higher-energy [[isomer]]s such as {{chem|CNH|2|+}}, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, ''cis''-HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''trans''-HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laboratory studies ==

As a relatively simple molecular ion, HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has been extensively studied in the laboratory.  The very first spectrum taken at any wavelength focused on the ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (C−H stretch) ro-vibrational band in the [[infrared]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Soon afterward, the same authors reported on their investigation of the ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (N−H stretch) band.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| title = High resolution infrared spectroscopy of the ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (NH stretch) and ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (CH stretch) bands of HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Following these initial studies, several groups published manuscripts on the various ro-vibrational spectra of HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, including studies of the ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; band (C≡N stretch)
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

While all of these studies focused on ro-vibrational spectra in the [[infrared]], it was not until 1998 that technology advanced far enough for an investigation of the pure rotational spectrum of HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[microwave]] region to take place.  At that time, microwave spectra for HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and its isotopomers HCND&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and DCND&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Recently, the pure rotational spectrum of HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was measured again in order to more precisely determine the molecular rotational constants ''B'' and ''D''.&lt;ref name="amano"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spectrum ==
As mentioned above, the most recent laboratory measurement of the pure rotational spectrum of the ground state of HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was performed in 2006.&lt;ref name="amano" /&gt;  This study determined the most precise values of the molecular constants to date.  Using these constants in conjunction with the program [http://pgopher.chm.bris.ac.uk/ PGOPHER], one can generate the predicted rotational spectrum for the ground state of HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; at a temperature of 30 K, as shown below.  Being a linear molecule, HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; follows the basic rotational selection rule of Δ''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;±1.

== Formation and destruction ==
According to the database at [http://www.astrochemistry.net/ astrochemistry.net], the most advanced chemical models of HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; include 71 total formation reactions and 21 total destruction reactions.  Of these, however, only a handful dominate the overall formation and destruction.  In the case of formation, the 7 dominant reactions are:

:{{chem|H|3|+}} + HCN → HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:{{chem|H|3|+}} + HNC → HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:HCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCN → HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO
:HCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HNC → HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO
:H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCN → HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HNC → HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H

Using rate coefficients from [http://www.astrochemistry.net/ astrochemistry.net] and [http://www.udfa.net/ the UMIST Database for Astrochemistry] in conjunction with model interstellar abundances

Being an [[ion]], HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is predominantly destroyed by the electron recombination reactions:

:e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → HCN + H
:e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → HNC + H
:e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → CN + H + H

Using the same sources as above, the relative importance of these destruction reactions are calculated and shown in the table below.  Also shown in the table is the ion-neutral reaction HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO, in order to demonstrate just how dominant electron recombination is.

== Astronomical detections ==

=== Initial interstellar detection ===

HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was first detected in [[list of molecules in interstellar space|interstellar space]] in 1986 toward the dense cloud [[Sagittarius B2|Sgr&amp;nbsp;B2]] using the [[NRAO]] 12&amp;nbsp;m dish and the [[Texas Millimeter Wave Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

These observations utilized the ''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1–0, 2–1, and 3–2 pure rotational transitions at 74, 148, and 222&amp;nbsp;GHz, respectively.

Models of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]'s atmosphere had predicted that HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; would be the dominant ion present, and a strong peak in the mass spectrum at Z/M=28 seems to support this theory.

Educated at [[King William's College|King William’s College]], Isle of Man, Mayhew began his career as an apprentice with the [[Wigan Coal and Iron Company|Wigan, Coal and Iron Company Ltd]]. Mayhew soon established himself as a preeminent mining engineer managing and part-owning collieries throughout the [[Wigan]] district. He became Managing Director of the Brinsop Hall Colliery Company working in partnership with A. H. Leech.

Wigan experienced dramatic economic growth and the population grew rapidly as the coal and textile industry expanded in the 1870s and 1880s. Mayhew was well connected. His brother Walter was Mayor of Wigan between 1876 and 1878 and in 1883 Mayhew formed a partnership with [[William Ewart Gladstone|W. E. Gladstone]], then Prime Minister. He started managing Gladstone’s extensive collieries and brickworks in [[Hawarden]] and in 1888 took over Halls Collieries at Swadlincote, Burton-on-Trent employing close to 2,000 mineworkers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wigantoday.net Wigan Observer, Obit. August 17, 1926&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broughton, Nova Scotia==

In the early 20th Century Horace Mayhew and Thomas Lancaster founded the town of [[Broughton, Nova Scotia]] and established the Cape Breton Coal, Iron &amp; Railway Company.&lt;ref&gt;'ACAP proposes takeover of Broughton ruins' Cape Breton Post, Sydney, July 23rd 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayhew was President of the company and also President of the Canada Land &amp; Development Corporation on whose land the town of Broughton was built. He was extensively involved in the planning of Broughton and invested heavily in the development of the town and mines, of which there were several workable seams.

Construction of the town began in 1905, with streets laid out and a number of large official buildings constructed, including the general mining building, a church, the Broughton Arms Hotel and the Crown Hotel. The town was one of the first planned communities in Canada and the Broughton Arms, a palatial hotel, was said to be the ‘best east of Montreal’.&lt;ref&gt;‘Italian Lives – Cape Breton Memories’ pp 176. University College of Cape Breton Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel boasted all the modern conveniences including the first revolving door in the Americas. The distinctive architecture of rounded towers and verandahs marked it as an upper-class hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Nova Scotia Department of Communities, Culture and Heritage.

Mayhew’s eldest son, Horace Dixon Mayhew Jnr, came out to [[Cape Breton (Nova Scotia)|Cape Breton]] with his father, spending the winter of 1906 at Broughton. Mayhew lobbied the Nova Scotia government (of [[George Henry Murray|George Murray]]) to increase rail subsidies without success and the untimely death of his son on 12 August 1906 coincided with the decline in Broughton's success.&lt;ref&gt;The St. John Sun, August 13th 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company went bankrupt in 1907 after it failed to secure rail transportation to get its coal to port, largely because of opposition from its Cape Breton competition, the [[Dominion Coal Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Cape Breton Post, December 12, 2012  http://www.capebretonpost.com/Community/2012-12-12/article-3138764/Book-tells-story-of-Cape-Breton%26rsquos-ghost-town/1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Broughton: A Return To Cape Breton’s Ghost Town’ By Eleanor Anderson, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayhew returned to Flintshire and established a new practice with his remaining sons. The firm Mayhew &amp; Mayhew later owned several collieries in the Buckley and Hawarden districts, including Aston Hall, Mare Hey, Dublin Main and Main coal collieries. He died in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Wigan Evening Post, Obit. 17 Aug. 1926&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''House of Taga''' ([[Chamorro language|Chamoru]]: ''Guma Taga'') is an archeological site located near [[San Jose, Northern Mariana Islands|San Jose Village]], on the island of [[Tinian]], [[United States]] [[Northern Mariana Islands|Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]], in the [[Marianas|Marianas Archipelago]]. The site is the location of a series of prehistoric [[latte stone]] pillars which were quarried about {{convert|4000|ft|m}} south of the site, only one of which is left standing erect due to past earthquakes. The name is derived from a [[mythological]] chief named Taga, who is said to have erected the pillars as a foundation for his own house.

==The structures==

[[File:Fallen latte stones at Taga House, Tinian.jpg|left|thumb|Fallen stones at House of Taga]]
The prehistoric [[latte stone]] pillars (also called taga stones) at House of Taga stood {{convert|15|ft|m}} high, and were quarried about {{convert|4000|ft|m}} south of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=William N|title=Prehistoric Architecture in Micronesia|year=1989|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-76506-1|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[megalith]]s consisted of a base (haligi) and a hemispherical cap (tasa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=David|title=South Pacific Handbook: With Galapagos Support|year=1982|publisher=TBS The Book Service Ltd|isbn=978-0-9603322-3-6|page=497}}&lt;/ref&gt; When uprighted in spaced parallel rows, it is believed a house was built on top.

==Legend of Chief Taga and his house==

===Alexander Spoehr===
In his 1957 published work ''Marianas Prehistory: Survey and Excavations on Saipin, Tinian and Rota'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Academy of Sciences|title=Biographical Memoirs, Volume 69|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-05346-4|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Alexander Spoehr]] noted that the House of Taga had most likely been the central latte structure among eighteen such structures on Tinian. According to legend collected by Spoehr, a {{convert|10|ft|m}} tall [[Guam]] chief named Taga married a Rota woman. The chief began the [[Rota Latte Stone Quarry (Mariana Islands)|Rota Latte Stone Quarry]] to carve stone for their home. Midway through, he changed his mind and instead built the house on Tinian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rainbird|first=Paul|title=The Archaeology of Micronesia|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65630-6|pages=117, 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variation===
One variation on that story also puts Taga's origins at [[Guam]]. As a child, he began demonstrating such super-human strength that his own father was jealous and tried to kill him. Taga escaped from his father by jumping off a cliff on Guam and landing on Rota, almost {{convert|50|mi}} away. On Rota, Taga grew to adulthood and became a braggart about his prowess. According to the legend, it was Taga who began the As Nieves Quarry on Rota and abandoned it for reasons that are unclear.&lt;ref name="Micronesian Legends"/&gt;

Taga married and had a family, and they sailed to Tinian. His reputation had preceded him, and the chief of Tinian presented several challenges to test Taga's strength. The chief was subsequently so impressed with Taga's abilities that he named Taga the chief of the island. Taga carved the latte stones to single-handedly build his Tinian house and a village for his people. He carried the multi-ton pillars all by himself. As the years passed, while on a trip to [[Saipan]], Taga's wife gave birth to a son that Taga bragged about to no end. Taga's brother tired of all the bragging and challenged Taga to a contest, which ended in a draw between the two brothers. This was the end of Taga's bragging.&lt;ref name="Micronesian Legends"/&gt;

Eventually, Taga and his wife were the parents of twelve children. When Taga realized that his youngest son had greater strength than he, Taga flew into a jealous rage and murdered his son. Taga's wife died of grief. His youngest daughter then speared Taga to death and died of a broken heart. As each of Taga's twelve children died, their spirits inhabited the latte stones of his house. Each spirit was released by the individual latte stone falling to the ground. The lone standing megalith today is said to imprison the spirit of the daughter who murdered Taga.&lt;ref name="Micronesian Legends"&gt;{{cite book|last=Acosta|first=Therese F|title=Micronesian Legends|year=2002|publisher=Bess Press|isbn=978-1-57306-129-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVVQ46epBqwC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22chief+taga%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=z2WOTdLRJ4G-sQOJrviHCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chief%20taga%22&amp;f=false |chapter=The Story of Taga|pages=12–17|author2=Flood, Bo and William |author3=Strong, Beret E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4831">'''Jasper conglomerate''', is an informal term for a very distinctive [[Paleoproterozoic]] [[quartz]] and [[jasper]] [[pebble]] [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] that occurs within the middle part of the Lorrain Formation of the Cobalt Group of the [[Huronian Supergroup]]. It is also known by other names including '''pebble jasper conglomerate''', '''St. Joseph Island puddingstone''', '''Drummond Island puddingstone''', '''Michigan puddingstone'''. The jasper conglomerate occurs on [[St. Joseph Island (Ontario)|St. Joseph Island]] and the [[St. Marys River (Michigan–Ontario)|St. Mary's River]] area north and northwest of the [[Bruce Mines, Ontario|Bruce Mines]] of [[Northern Ontario]], about {{convert|65|km|mi}} east of [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]]. This conglomerate consisted originally of gravelly [[sand]]s and sandy [[gravel]]s composed of subrounded pebbles of red jasper, white [[quartzite]], semi-transparent quartz, and black [[chert]], with coarse-grained sand matrix. Typically it contains between about 30% to as much as 90% pebbles. It has been cemented and partially metamorphosed into a quartzitic conglomerate. The beds of jasper conglomerates fill erosional troughs and channels of what are interpreted to be either [[alluvial fan]] or [[braided river]] deposits of the Lorrain Formation.&lt;ref name="Lowey1985a"&gt;Lowey, G.W.

Because of its distinctive nature, pebble- to [[boulder]]-size fragments of jasper conglomerate can be recognized as [[glacial erratic]]s in [[Pleistocene]] glacial [[till]]s and [[glacial drift|drift]] within large parts of the [[glaciated]] Midwestern United States. Fragments of jasper conglomerate were eroded by continental [[ice-sheet]]s from Northern Ontario and spread across all of Michigan and as far south as Ohio and Kentucky during repeated glacial advances and retreats. For example, pebble to boudler-size fragments of jasper conglomerate are quite common on [[Drummond Township, Michigan|Drummond Island, Michigan]] where it is called Drummond Island puddingstone.&lt;ref name="Slawson1933a"&gt;Slawson, C.B.

In the UK and Australia, a jig doll usually goes by that name, or any of the following: dancing doll; busker's puppet; clogger; jigger; Mr. Jollyboy or Mrs. Jollyboy (a commercial version made by Dover Toys, UK), etc.&lt;ref name=Brady/&gt; A Mr Jollyboy is in the collection of the Norwich Museum.&lt;ref name=EATMT&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jig Dolls |work= |publisher=East Anglian Traditional Music Trust |date= |url=http://www.eatmt.org.uk/big_jig.htm |doi= |accessdate=2009-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608003652/http://www.eatmt.org.uk/big_jig.htm |archivedate=June 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA, a jig doll would be called a limberjack or limberjill or limbertoy; paddle puppet; stick puppet. A commercial version was called: Dancing Dan or Dancin' Dan; Dapper Dan; Dancing Jo or Dancin' Jo; Stepping Sam or Steppin' Sam, etc.&lt;ref name=Brady/&gt;

In French-speaking parts of [[Canada]] they are referred to as ''les gigueux''.

In one old [[patent]] the term Manipulable Doll was used.&lt;ref name=Brady/&gt;

==History==
Dancing dolls have been popular street entertainment for hundreds of years. Older versions dating back to the 16th century were known as ''Poupées à la Planchette'' or ''Marionettes à la Planchette.'' These puppets, operated by a horizontal string attached to the musician's leg, 'danced' on a board on the ground as the musician tapped his foot. They were, and still are, popular street entertainment throughout Europe.&lt;ref name=Brady/&gt;

At some stage, possibly in the mid-19th century, the string was replaced by a wooden rod fixed into the back of the body,&lt;!-- This contradicts the "and still are" in the previous paragraph --&gt; or attached to a wire loop on the top of the doll's head, with the doll dancing on a vibrating board. Later, some jig dolls were automated.&lt;ref name=Brady/&gt;

The [http://www.eatmt.org.uk/big_jig.htm East Anglian Traditional Music Trust (EATMT)] reports that the earliest jig doll yet discovered is one from the Victorian [[Great Exhibition]] at [[The Crystal Palace]] dating from 1851. A female figure, dressed in a skirt, petticoat, bodice and shawl, it is now in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080511234708/http://www.bradfordmuseums.org/cliffecastle/index.htm Cliffe Castle Museum], [[Keighley]], Yorkshire."&lt;ref name=EATMT/&gt;

Old ones have become collectors' items and can fetch high prices. Some antique [[clockwork]] [[Tinning|tin-plate]] 'jiggers' can fetch anything up to £2,000 (in 2009).&lt;ref name=Brady/&gt;

Traditional English [[Folk music|folk singers and musicians]] such as [[Bob Cann]] from [[Dartmoor]], [[Billy Bennington]] and [[Walter Pardon]] (both from [[Norfolk]]) sometimes made their own jig dolls. In England, jig dolls have perhaps survived better in [[East Anglia]] than other parts of the country; the EATMT has commissioned a collection of them.&lt;ref name=EATMT/&gt;

==Variations on the theme==
Jig dolls are essentially home-made toys. Typical versions could represent sailors, male and/or female costumed folk-dancers, African-Americans, Native Americans, Morris dancers, [[Punch and Judy]], [[Adolf Hitler]], even animals such as frogs, horses, chickens, dogs, and cows, etc. They may be clothed, painted or left as bare polished wood. Sometimes the heads are whittled to show distinctive facial features.&lt;ref name=Brady/&gt; Historical figures such as [[Harry Lauder]] and more recent ones such as [[John Major]] (dancing on a board bearing an image of [[Margaret Thatcher]]) have been made.&lt;ref name=EATMT/&gt;

Some [[Punch and Judy]] Professors also use jig dolls to attract a crowd. One has a jig doll of [[Charlie Chaplin]]. In the UK, some folk dance bands have a jig doll to entertain the audience in the interval of a [[barn dance]]. Such dolls may occasionally appear at live traditional [[Irish traditional music session|music sessions]] in English [[public house|pubs]] (in the past, step dancing by members of the audience would have been a common feature of such a pub session).&lt;ref name=Brady/&gt;

In Québec and French-speaking Canada, jig dolls can feature as a [[percussion instrument]] for a folk dance band, even to the extent of the plank on which a doll 'dances' being fitted with a small microphone connected to the [[Public address|PA]]&lt;ref name=Brady/&gt;

The '''Jiyeh Power Station oil spill''' is an [[environmental disaster]] caused by the release of [[Fuel oil|heavy fuel oil]] into the eastern [[Mediterranean]] after storage tanks at the [[thermal power station]] in [[Jieh|Jiyeh]], [[Lebanon]], {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Beirut]], were bombed by the Israeli Air force on July 14 and July 15, 2006 during the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5233358.stm|title=Environmental 'crisis' in Lebanon |author=|publisher=[[BBC News]] |date= 31 July 2006| accessdate=5 January 2010 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant's damaged tanks leaked up to 30,000 tonnes of oil into the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]], A 10&amp;nbsp;km wide oil slick covered 170&amp;nbsp;km of coastline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crisis talks on Lebanon oil spill|date=2006-08-16|publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4798965.stm | accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Damage is done' to Lebanon coast|date=2006-08-08|publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5255966.stm | accessdate=5 January 2010|first=Mark|last=Kinver}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zki.dlr.de/applications/2006/lebanon/lebanon_2006_en.html DLR: Oil Spill at the Lebanese Coast]&lt;/ref&gt;
and threatened Turkey and Cyprus. The slick killed fish, threatened the habitat of endangered green sea turtles, and potentially increased the risk of cancer.

Although [[Al Jazeera]] compared the scale of the oil spill to that of the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/09CB9736-6131-403E-A4CA-1033CD1107D5.htm |title=UN sounds Lebanon oil spill alarm |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=2006-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823180619/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/09CB9736-6131-403E-A4CA-1033CD1107D5.htm |archivedate=2006-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; later assessment found that the volume spilled was 15 000 - 30 000 tonnes compared to 42 000 tonnes for the Exxon Valdez oil spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14937105/ns/world_news-world_environment/t/lebanon-still-digging-out-oil-spill/#.U_WQMfmSxpE|title=Lebanon still digging out from oil spill|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coastline affected was between 150–170&amp;nbsp;km, while the Exxon Valdez oil spill affected 2,100&amp;nbsp;km of coastline.

According to Lebanon's Environment Minister [[Yacoub Sarraf]], Israeli jets deterred firemen from putting out the fire at the storage units, which continued for 10 days, and the Israeli Navy [[blockade]] stopped Lebanese and foreign officials from surveying the damage of the spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=apje8CwcPPSA&amp;refer=home|title=Lebanon Oil Spill May Rival Exxon Valdez of 1989 (Update1)|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=2006-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

The spill affected one-third of Lebanon's coastline. Beaches and rocks were covered in a black [[oil sludge|sludge]] up to [[Byblos]], north of Beirut and extended into the southern parts of [[Syria]].  The slick killed fish, and threatens the habitat of the endangered green sea turtle as well as the endangered logger head sea turtle.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

*On 31 July the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) expressed its "grave concern" about oil pollution in Lebanese coastal waters.  The oil slick was at the time reported to cover one third of the coastline (10 miles) and it was considered possible that the eventual slick could reach 35,000 tons of oil.  [[Malta]]-based Regional Marine Pollution Emergency Response Centre (REMPEC) for the Mediterranean, which advised the Lebanese government, reportedly said "a very small quantity of tar balls" also reached the Syrian coast in the north.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The UNEP later revised those concerns and has stated that long-term damage from this incident has been avoided. Already in 2007, one year after the spill, the UNEP published a report that indicated that the regularly occurring anthropogenic stress from untreated sewage, boating and other activities is a greater stress on the Lebanese marine environment than the oil spill. The report indicated that the disposal of the waste from the temporary storage during the cleanup was only major issue remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://postconflict.unep.ch/publications/UNEP_Lebanon.pdf |title=Lebanon Post-Conflict Environmental  Assessment  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(18&amp;nbsp;MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Lebanese Environment Minister said, "Up until now 20,000 to 30,000 tons heavy fuel oil have spilled out into the sea," "Until now, the worst ecological disasters have taken place in the oceans and it's the first time that an oil spill has happened outside the open sea," "We can have no illusions." "If nothing is done, not only will currents flowing towards the north mean that one third of Lebanon's coastline be hit, but also [[Cyprus]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]] and even [[Israel]]," "The fauna and the Mediterranean ecosystem risk suffering badly and certain species are threatened with extinction," "I have appealed to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], the [[United States]], all the countries which have already suffered oil slicks to ask for technical assistance as we cannot act on our own," Lebanese Environment Minister [[Yacub Sarraf]] said.

==International response==
*{{flagcountry|Kuwait}} - They have sent 40 tons of material to thicken the [[oil]] and oil absorbing products.
*{{flagcountry|Israel}} - Damage assessment and cleanup operations were delayed by four weeks while Israel continued its bombing campaign.&lt;ref name="HMAID2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/aug/16/guardiansocietysupplement.pollution|title=Sands are running out for Lebanon's ecosystem|work=The Guardian|first=Wael|last=Hmaidan | location=London | date=16 August 2006 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===
The [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed a resolution by 170 votes to 6 ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Israel]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Palau]], and [[United States]] voting against)&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-61-PV.83 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbatim Report |session=61 |meeting=83 |page=8 |anchor=pg008-bk23 |date=20 December 2006 |speakername=The President |accessdate=2007-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; calling upon Israel to assume responsibility for compensation for the costs of repairing the environmental damage and restoration of the marine environment.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES61194_page2"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-61-194 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=61 |resolution_number=194 |highlight=rect_187,174_818,267 |page=2 |accessdate=2007-11-13|date=20 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Nations Second Committee]] where the draft resolution was discussed,&lt;ref name="UN_AC261SR31_page2"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-C.2-61-SR.31 |type=None |page=2 |accessdate=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United States explained its opposition in terms of its one-sided and inappropriate nature,&lt;ref name="UN_AC261SR31_page2Summary"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-C.2-61-SR.31 |type=Summary Report |body=Second Committee| date=14 December 2006 |highlight=rect_502,680_920,884 |page=2 |accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Canada felt that "the General Assembly was not the appropriate forum to address questions of legal liability or compensation of the cost of repairing environmental damage".&lt;ref name="UN_AC261SR31_page4"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-C.2-61-SR.31 |type=Summary Report | body=Second Committee| date=14 December 2006|highlight=rect_93,204_499,372 |page=4 |accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Israel objected to the omission of any mention of "the entire reason for the conflict", namely that "Hizbollah terrorists had crossed an internationally recognized border into Israel and kidnapped and killed Israeli soldiers", as well as the lack of concern for the "half a million trees and 52,000 [[dunam]]s of forest that had burnt down in Israel as a result of fires caused by Hizbollah rockets; the 25 Israeli cement and asbestos buildings that had been damaged, polluting an area of 20,000 square metres; or the direct hit by a [[Katyusha rocket]] on a sludge-thickening plant in Tzafat."&lt;ref name="UN_AC261SR31_page3"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-C.2-61-SR.31 |type=Summary Report| body=Second Committee| date=14 December 2006 |highlight=rect_87,139_497,1047 |page=3 |accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimate by the UN of the cost of the oil spill in terms of harm to the Lebanese economy and cleaning up operations is $203million.&lt;ref name="UN_A62343_page7"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-62-343 |type=Document |body=General Assembly |session=62 |title=Oil Slick on Lebanese shores|date=24 October 2007|document_number=343 |page=7 |accessdate=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Israel has refused to answer any request for compensation.&lt;ref name="UN_A62343_page9"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-62-343 |type=Document |body=General Assembly |session=62 |title=Oil Slick on Lebanese shores|date=24 October 2007|document_number=343 |page=9 |accessdate=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this there was a precise rerun of the discussion and vote in December 2007, with the Australia, Canada, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau and the United States coming out again against a General Assembly Resolution requesting Israel to take responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-62-PV.78 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbotim Report |session=62 |meeting=78 |page=13 |anchor=pg013-bk03 |date=19 December 2007 |accessdate=2008-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its defence the ambassador from Israel said the failure to mention the environmental catastrophes in Israel (half a million trees on fire), as well as the entire cause of the conflict (Hizbollah crossing the southern border of Lebanon to kidnap Israeli soldiers) proved that the resolution was an act of political demonization.

==Media awareness==

A documentary by [[Hady Zaccak]] called ''The Oil Spill in Lebanon'' won first prize at the ''European and Mediterranean Film Festival on the TV of the Sea''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lebanon oil spill documentary wins first prize at international film festival|url=http://cms.iucn.org/where/asia/index.cfm?uNewsID=240|publisher=IUCN|date=9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clean-up effort ==

The Lebanon Ministry of Environment, with the help of many donor countries and non-profit organizations, has been working on the clean-up effort.  This includes legal issues, such as compensation, which is being dealt
with through the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. The government of Israel has still, to this day, not compensated the government of Lebanon for the damage that was done.  The requests of compensation from the United Nations to the government of Israel went unanswered. The objective of the entire project is to manage the environmental catastrophe by attaining funds to complete the clean-up.&lt;ref name="undp.org.lb"&gt;Moussalem, Manal. (2008, November 13). Post-conflict oil spill clean-up project. Retrieved from http://www.undp.org.lb/ProjectFactSheet/projectDetail.cfm?projectId=54&lt;/ref&gt;
The total amount that was raised by donor countries and organizations was $2,919,400. Cleanup work was funded by the country of Japan through the [[UNDP]] and by the country of Norway through the Higher Relief Commission in [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;General Assembly, United Nations. (2009). Oil slick on lebanese shores. UNSG Report, A64(259), Retrieved from http://www.moe.gov.lb/oilspill2006/docs/UN%20SG%20report%20A%2064%20259-2009%20english.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Expenditures between the years of 2006 and 2007 where estimated to be around $1,835,587.&lt;ref name="undp.org.lb"/&gt;
The clean-up effort included the Dalieh Fishermen's wharf and three sites between Jadra and Ras al Saadiyat and three sites between [[Jieh]] and [[Beirut]]. Surveys of the coasts from Southern to Norther Lebanon
took place in coordination with surveys of the underwater shorelines. A comprehensive shoreline survey of the catastrophic oil spill was put into action from the southern city of Tyre to the northern border of Lebanon, and it was undertaken between the months of November and December 2008, with funding from the International Development Agency of the Canadian government through [[UNDP]] in coordination with the Ministry of the Environment of [[Lebanon]] and under its technical supervision. The findings were finally, and with long anticipation, published by the United Nations in  September 2009. Minor and pre-final clean-up activities at about 12 sites along the Lebanese coast, with a total length of approximately 7.5 kilometers, were quickly put into play and monitored by the Ministry of the Environment of the government of [[Lebanon]].

A waste management project was also put in place in order to safely collect and transport the polluting material from the shorelines to temporary storage sites.  The most recent United Nations report was published on August 7, 2009. This was the final report made by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. The General Assembly decided to establish an Eastern Mediterranean Oil Spill Restoration [[trust fund|Trust Fund]], based on contributions from donor countries and organizations, to provide assistance and support to the States directly and adversely affected in their management of an environmentally sound sea and wildlife, from clean-up process to safe disposal of the oily waste that is on the shorelines, of this environmental disaster caused by the destruction of the oil storage tanks at the [[Jieh]] electric power plant in Lebanon.

The '''Mark''' (from [[Middle High German]]: Marc, march, brand) is originally a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] weight or mass unit, which supplanted the [[Pound (mass)|pound]] weight as a [[Noble metal|precious metals]] and [[coin]]age weight from the 11th century. The Mark is traditionally a half pound weight and was usually divided into 8 [[ounce]]s or 16 [[Lot (unit)|Lot]]. The significance of the ''[[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]] Mark'' (Kölner Mark) in the German-speaking areas corresponded to about 234 [[gram]].

Like the [[Germany|German]] systems, the [[France|French]] [[French units of measurement#Weight|poids de marc]] weight system considered one "Marc" equal to half-a-pound (8 ounces).

Like the [[pound (mass)|pound]] of 12 troy ounces (373 g), the mark was also used as a unit of currency, e.g. in the 1087 poem "[[The Rime of King William]]" ("marks of gold"), in many [[Shakespeare]]an plays set in medieval [[England]], and in various incarnations in [[Germany]] and [[Finland]] until the adoption of the [[euro]] in 1999.

The '''Mochovce Nuclear Power Plant''' ({{lang-sk|Atómové elektrárne Mochovce}}, abbr. EMO) is a [[nuclear power plant]] located between the towns of [[Nitra]] and [[Levice]], on the site of the former village of [[Mochovce]], Slovakia. Two up-rated 470 MW (originally 440MW) reactors are presently in operation, with two further reactors of the same type under construction. Generating almost 7,000 [[GW·h]] of electricity a year, the power plant currently serves approximately 20% of Slovakia's energy needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seas.sk/?ide=565 Slovenské elektrárne, a.s. - elektrina jej výroba a predaj&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

A power plant consisting of four [[VVER 440]]/V-213 [[pressurized water reactor]]s was proposed in the 1970s. The [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] government began with a geological survey to find a suitable seismically stable site. After taking into account all factors the location of the village of Mochovce was chosen. Preparatory work was started on June 1981, and site construction for Mochovce-1 and Mochovce-2 started in November 1982.

Construction of the remaining two units, Mochovce-3 and Mochovce-4, began in 1985 but work on all four units was halted in 1991 due to a lack of funds. In 1995 the Slovak government approved a plan to finish the first pair with additional Western safety technology. The first two units were commissioned in 1998 and 1999 respectively. Commissioning of the plant has sparked protests in [[Austria]], a neighboring country strongly opposed to the use of nuclear energy in general. Installed capacity of units 1 and 2 was up-rated by 7% in 2008.

Construction of Units 3 and 4 restarted in November 2008. They were planned initially to be completed in 2012 and 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slovakspectator.sk/clanok.asp?cl=26870 |work=[[The Slovak Spectator]]|title= SE to complete Mochovce nuclear power plant}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the completion date was shifted to 2016 and 2017.&lt;ref name=nei-20141124&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsmochovce-34-costs-rise-to-euro-4.6-billion-4447552 |title=Mochovce 3&amp;4 costs rise to e4.6bn |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=24 November 2014 |accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the completion date has slipped to 2018 and 2019.&lt;ref name=wnn-20180823/&gt;

The owner of the plant is [[Slovenské elektrárne]], which is 34% [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned]]. [[Enel]], an Italian utility company, was the majority 66% owners,&lt;ref name="constr"&gt;[http://www.foratom.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=585&amp;Itemid=341 Mochovce nuclear new build programme kicks into action; 2008-12-28]&lt;/ref&gt; but sold half its stake to Czech energy group [[Energetický a průmyslový holding|EPH]] in 2017. Enel plans to sell its remaining stake after completion of units 3&amp;4.&lt;ref name=wnn-20180823/&gt;

==Units 1&amp;2 operations==
[[File:Mochovce 2005-01-19 1.jpg|thumb|Reactor hall for units 1&amp;2]]
[[File:Mochovce 2005-01-17 1.jpg|thumb|Control room for units 1&amp;2]]
Since late 2008 the two operating units at Mochovce NPP have uprated power output to 235 MWe per turbogenerator, ergo the total installed capacity of units 1 and 2 in Mochovce NPP stands at 940 MWe. In 2009, the plant managed to generate over 7 TWh of electricity during a one-year period for the first time in its history. This represents approximately one quarter of the overall annual electricity consumption in Slovakia.&lt;ref name=seas0&gt;[http://www.seas.sk/mochovce-nuclear-power-plant AE Mochovce.] Slovenské elektráne, a.s.&lt;/ref&gt;
All units at Bohunice and Mochovce NPP feature evolutionary WWER pressurised water reactors, which are characteristic with:
*relatively low power and power density
*huge volume of water for cooling during normal operation as well as in emergency
*robust design with reinforced concrete containment with walls thick up to 1.5 m
*triple redundancy safety system (3 x 100%)
*high level of passive safety.&lt;ref name=seas1&gt;[http://www.seas.sk/nuclear-power-plants Nuclear power plants.] Slovenské elektráne, a.s.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of electricity generation in nuclear power plants is similar to that of conventional thermal power plants. The only difference is the heat source. In thermal plants, heat is produced from fossile fuels (coal, gas), generating vast quantities of greenhouse gas, whereas in nuclear power plants, nuclear fuel is used (natural or enriched uranium).
In the pressurized water reactors, fuel in the form of fuel assemblies is placed in reactor pressure vessel to which chemically terated water flows. The water flows through channels in the fuel assemblies and removes the heat that is produced during fission reaction. Water coming from the reactor has a temperature of about 297&amp;nbsp;°C (VVER reactor type); it is then led through the hot arm of the primary piping into heat exchanger - steam generator. In steam generator, water flows through a bunch of pipes and delivers the heat to water from secondary circuit and has a temperature of 222&amp;nbsp;°C. When cooled down, primary circuit water is led back to reactor core. Secondary circuit water is evaporated in steam generator and the steam is led via steam collector to the blades of a turbine. The turbine shaft turns a generator that generates electric energy.
Having delivered its energy to the turbine, steam condensates in condenser, and getting back to water state, it flows back, via heaters, to steam generator. In condenser, the mixture is cooled by a third cooling circuit. In this latter circuit, water is cooled by air flowing from the bottom to the upper part of the cooling tower due to so-called chimney effect. The stream of air takes along water steam and small water droplets, and that is why clouds of steam form above the cooling towers.&lt;ref name=seas1/&gt;

==Units 3&amp;4 construction==
Units 3&amp;4 of Mochovce NPP are currently under construction. This project is:
*one of the three projects of nuclear power plants currently under construction in Europe
*the largest private investment in the history of Slovakia
*2/3 of works on site is performed by Slovak companies
*90% of the population around power plant is in favour of the completion of Units 3&amp;4
*each unit will have 471 MWe output
*annual production of two units will save over 7 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/mochovce-3-4-npp&lt;/ref&gt;

Unit 3 is expected to be operational by the end of 2018 and unit 4 by the end of 2019.&lt;ref name=wnn-20180823&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Cold-testing-completed-at-new-Slovak-reactor |title=Cold testing completed at new Slovak reactor |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=23 August 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Although the original power plant design featured safety improvements such as seismically resistant attachment of equipment, it did not suit the safety and regulatory environment of the 1990s. To rectify this the German company [[Siemens]] supplied a new control system, and Western and EU safety measures were implemented during the final phases of construction. According to the plant operator Mochovce nuclear power plant was the first Soviet-sourced nuclear plant in the former [[Eastern Bloc]] to meet the safety standards of Western nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/power-plants/nuclear-installations/atomove-elektrarne-mochovce-en/history-of-emo/ History of EMO on the Slovenské elektrárne webpage&lt;/ref&gt;
The nuclear industry was conceived and developed with a conscientious awareness of having to face and respect strict safety guidelines, as well as technical, environmental and health standards.
For this reason, safety at a power plant is verified and controlled at maximum possible levels in all of its phases (project design, authorization, construction, operation, decommissioning and final dismantlement), using procedures that have been elaborated exclusively for the needs of this specific sector.
In addition, the realization of a nuclear power station is subordinated by a particularly complex authorization process comprising two different components: authorization from a nuclear safety standpoint, and in terms of its environmental impact (EIA – Environmental Impact Assessment).
In concrete terms, safety in the electronuclear industry is entrusted to a set of technical, organizational and human measures enacted throughout all stages of an installation's lifetime, with the aim of protecting citizens and the surrounding environment from a release of radioactive material under any circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/nuclear-safety&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==
Nuclear power plants emit no greenhouse gas to the atmosphere, in this way NPPs annually contribute to CO2 emission reduction by 15 million tonnes in Slovakia.
Nuclear power plants hence contribute significantly to the obligation to reduce emissions of harmful greenhouse gas to the atmosphere.
Mochovce NPP meets all international requirements and that the operation impact is minimal.
Water required for cooling is taken from a water dam built on the nearby Hron river, which ensures sufficient supply of water even in extremely dry climate conditions. The impact of the discharged waters on the quality of the Hron river water, fauna and flora is negligible.
Emissions to the atmosphere and effluents to the hydrosphere are regularly measured and assessed in the 15-km area around the plant. There are 25 monitoring stations of the tele-dosimetry system, which continuously monitor the dose rate of gamma radiation, activity of aerosols and radioactive iodine in the air, soil, water and food chain (feed, milk, agricultural products). The volume of radioactive substances contained in liquid and gaseous discharges is considerably lower than the limits set out by authorities.&lt;ref name=seas0/&gt;

==Radiation protection==
For radiation protection of the power plant staff and population, the ALARA principle is applied. This principle ensures that the radiation exposure inside and outside the power plant is As Low As Reasonably Achievable and well below the limits set by legislation. The impact of the NPP operation on the environment and human health is negligible with respect to other radiation sources present in everyday life. There are 24 monitoring stations of the tele-dosimetry system in the 20&amp;nbsp;km radius around the power plant, which continuously monitors the dose rate of gamma radiation, volume activity of aerosols and radioactive iodine in the air, soil, water and food chain (feed, milk, agricultural produces). The volume of radioactive substances contained in liquid and gaseous discharges is considerably lower than the limits set out by authorities.&lt;ref name=pdf&gt;[http://www.seas.sk/data/contentlink/cfakepathmochovce-basicfacts-en.pdf Mochovce Nuclear Power Plant. Clear energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stress tests==
Immediately after the Fukushima accident, European politicians, representatives of the nuclear industry and regulatory bodies agreed on the undertaking of power-plant safety reviews. All 15 member states of the EU operating nuclear power plants were involved. The testing of the two Bohunice NPP V2 units and all four Mochovce NPP units was carried out mainly through engineering analyses, calculations and reports.
Stress tests analysed extraordinary external events – earthquakes, floods, and impacts of other events that might result in the multiple loss of power-plant safety functions. The combination of events, including loss of power supply, long-term water supply breakdown, as well as loss of power supply due to extreme climate conditions were also assessed.
Stress tests revealed no deficiencies requiring immediate action; the further safe operation of neither the operating units nor the units under construction was put in doubt. Identified measures would further increase nuclear safety, for example by adding mobile diesel-generator for recharging of back-up batteries.&lt;ref name=pdf/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4146">'''Neodymium-doped yttrium orthovanadate''' ('''Nd:YVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''') is a [[crystal]]line material formed by adding [[neodymium]] ions to [[yttrium orthovanadate]]. It is commonly used as an [[active laser medium]] for [[diode-pumped solid-state laser]]s. It comes as a transparent blue-tinted material. It is [[birefringent]], therefore rods made of it are usually rectangular.

As in all neodymium-doped laser crystals, the lasing action of Nd:YVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is due to its content of [[neodymium]] ions, which may be excited by visible or infrared light, and undergo an electronic transition resulting in emission of coherent infrared light at a lower frequency, usually at 1064&amp;nbsp;nm (other transitions in Nd are available, and can be selected for by external optics).

'''Nitroguanidine''' is an [[organic compound]] &lt;!--kinda--&gt;with the formula (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CNNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a colorless, crystalline solid that melts at 232&amp;nbsp;°C and decomposes at 250&amp;nbsp;°C.  It is very flammable; but has a low impact sensitivity; however, its [[detonation velocity]] is high.  It is used as a propellant (air bags), fertilizer, and for other purposes.

==Manufacture==
Nitroguanidine is produced commercially by a two step process starting with the reaction of [[calcium cyanamide]] with [[ammonium nitrate]].  Via the intermediacy of biguanidine, this [[ammonolysis]] step affords the ''salt'' guanidinium nitrate.  In the second step, the nitrate salt is treated with sulfuric acid, a process that dehydrates the salt and forms the N-N bond.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Thomas Güthner, Bernd Mertschenk and Bernd Schulz "Guanidine and Derivatives" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a12_545.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   →    (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CNNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Nitroguanidine can also be generated by treatment of [[urea]] with ammonium nitrate.  Owing to problems of reliability and safety, this process has not been commerciallized despite its attractive economic features.

==Uses==

===Explosives===
Nitroguanidine is used as an explosive [[propellant]], notably in ''triple-base'' [[smokeless powder]]. The nitroguanidine reduces the propellant's flash and flame temperature without sacrificing chamber pressure. These are typically used in large bore guns where barrel erosion and flash are particularly important to avoid.

Nitroguanidine's explosive decomposition is given by the following equation:
H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2 ''(s)''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt; ''(g)''&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2 ''(g)''&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sub&gt; ''(s)''&lt;/sub&gt;

===Pesticides===
Nitroguanidine derivatives are used as [[insecticide]]s, having a comparable effect to [[nicotine]].  Derivatives include [[clothianidin]], [[dinotefuran]], [[imidacloprid]], and [[thiamethoxam]].

===Biochemistry===
The nitrosoylated derivative nitrosoguanidine is often used to mutagenize bacterial cells for biochemical studies.

==Structure==
Nitroguanidine exists in two [[tautomer]]ic forms, as a [[nitroimine]] (left) or a [[nitroamine]] (right).  In solution and in the solid state, the nitroimine form predominates (resonance stabilized).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Structure of nitroguanidine: nitroamine or nitroimine?

In [[astronomy]], an '''open cluster remnant''' ('''OCR''') is the final stage in the evolution of an [[open star cluster]].

== Theory ==

[[Viktor Ambartsumian]] (1938) and [[Lyman Spitzer]] (1940) showed that, from a theoretical point of view, it was impossible for a [[star cluster]] to evaporate completely; furthermore, Spitzer pointed out two possible final results for the evolution of a star cluster: evaporation provokes physical collisions between stars, or evaporation proceeds until a stable binary or higher multiplicity system is produced.

== Observations ==

Using objective-prism plates, [[Lodén]] (1987, 1988, 1993) has investigated the possible population of open cluster remnants in our [[Galaxy]] under the assumption that the stars in these clusters should have similar [[luminosity]] and [[spectral type]]. He found that about 30% of the objects in his sample could be catalogued as a possible type of cluster remnant. The membership for these objects is ≥ 15. The typical age of these systems is about 150 Myr with a range of 50-200 Myr. They show a significant density of binaries and a large number of [[optical binary|optical binaries]]. The stars of these OCRs have a trend to be massive and hence early-type (A-F) stars although this observational method includes a noticeable selection effect because bright early-type spectra are easier to detect than fainter and later ones. In fact, almost no stars with spectral type later than F appear among his objects. On the other hand, his results were not fully conclusive because there are known regions in the sky with many stars of the same spectral type but in which it is difficult to find two stars with the same [[proper motions]] or [[radial velocity]]. A striking example of this fact is Upgren 1; initially, it was suggested that this small group of seven F stars was the remnant of an old cluster (Upgren &amp; Rubin 1965) but later, Gatewood et al. (1988) concluded that Upgren 1 is only a chance alignment of F stars resulting from the close passage of members of two dynamically different sets of stars. Very recently, Stefanik et al. (1997) have shown that one of the sets is formed by 5 stars including a long-period binary and an unusual triple system.

== Simulations ==

Regarding numerical simulations, for systems with some 25 to 250 stars, [[Sebastian von Hoerner|von Hoerner]] (1960, 1963), [[Sverre Aarseth|Aarseth]] (1968) and [[T.S. van Albada|van Albada]] (1968) suggested that the final outcome of the evolution of an open cluster is one or more tightly bound binaries (or even a hierarchical triple system). Van Albada pointed out several observational candidates (σ Ori, ADS 12696, ρ Oph, 1 Cas, 8 Lac and 67 Oph) as being OCRs and Wielen (1975) indicated another one, the [[Ursa Major moving group]] (Collinder 285).

A '''particle-beam weapon''' uses a high-energy beam of atomic or [[subatomic particle]]s to damage the target by disrupting its [[atom]]ic and/or [[molecular]] structure. A particle-beam weapon is a type of [[directed-energy weapon]], which directs energy in a particular and focused direction using particles with miniscule mass. Some particle-beam weapons have potential practical applications, e.g. as an [[antiballistic]] [[missile defense]] system for the [[United States]] and its cancelled [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]. The vast majority, however, are [[science fiction]] and are among the most common weapon types of the genre. They have been known by myriad names: [[List of weapons in Star Trek#Phaser|phaser]]s, particle accelerator guns, [[ion]] cannons, [[proton]] beams, lightning rays, [[raygun]]s, etc.

The concept of particle-beam weapons comes from sound scientific principles and experiments currently underway around the world. One effective process to cause damage to or destroy a target is to simply [[Thermal shock|overheat]] it until it is no longer operational. However, after decades of [[R&amp;D]], particle-beam weapons are still very much at the research stage and it remains to be seen if or when they will be deployed as practical, high-performance military weapons.

[[Particle accelerators]] are a well-developed technology used in scientific research for decades. They use [[electromagnetic field]]s to accelerate and direct [[charged particles]] along a predetermined path, and [[electrostatic]] "lenses" to focus these streams for collisions. The [[cathode ray tube]] in many twentieth-century televisions and computer monitors is a very simple type of [[particle accelerator]]. More powerful versions include [[synchrotron]]s and [[cyclotron]]s used in nuclear research. A particle-beam weapon is a weaponized version of this technology. It accelerates [[charged particles]] (in most cases [[electron]]s, [[positron]]s, [[proton]]s, or [[ionized]] atoms, but very advanced versions can accelerate other particles such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] nuclei) to near-light speed and then shoots them at a target. These particles have tremendous [[kinetic energy]] which they impart to matter in the target, inducing near-instantaneous and catastrophic [[superheating]] at the surface, and when penetrating deeper, [[ionization]] effects which can be especially detrimental to electronics in the target.

==Beam generation==
Charged particle beams diverge rapidly due to mutual repulsion, so neutral particle beams are more commonly proposed. A neutral-particle-beam weapon [[ionize]]s atoms by either stripping an electron off of each atom, or by allowing each atom to capture an extra electron. The charged particles are then accelerated, and neutralized again by adding or removing electrons afterwards.

''[[Cyclotron particle accelerator]]s'', ''[[linear particle accelerator]]s'', and ''[[Synchrotron]] particle accelerators'' can accelerate positively charged hydrogen ions until their velocity approaches the [[speed of light]], and each individual ion has a kinetic energy range of 100 [[MeV]] to 1000 MeV or more. Then the resulting high energy protons can capture electrons from electron emitter electrodes, and be thus electrically neutralized. This creates an electrically neutral beam of high energy hydrogen atoms, that can proceed in a straight line at near the speed of light to smash into its target and damage it.

The pulsed particle beam emitted by such a weapon may contain 1 [[gigajoule]] of [[kinetic energy]] or more. The speed of a beam approaching that of light (299,792,458&amp;nbsp;m/s in a vacuum) in combination with the energy created by the weapon would negate any realistic means of defending a target against the beam. Target hardening through shielding or materials selection would be impractical or ineffective,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Richard M | last = Roberds | place = USA | url = http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1984/jul-aug/roberds.html | title = Introducing the Particle-Beam Weapon | journal = Air University Review | publisher = Air Force |date=July–August 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; especially if the beam could be maintained at full power and precisely focused on the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/npb.htm | title = Neutral Particle Beam (NPB) | publisher = Federation of American Scientists | date = 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==
The U.S. Defense [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] put into development the technology of a neutral particle beam to be used as a weapon in outer space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|display-authors=4|author=P.

A prototype neutral hydrogen beam weapon was launched aboard a [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|suborbital]] [[sounding rocket]] from [[White Sands Missile Range]] in July 1989 as part of the Beam Experiments Aboard Rocket (BEAR) project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-18/news/mn-4091_1_beam-weapon|title=’Star Wars’ Beam Weapon Has Successful Space Test|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 18, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached a maximum altitude of 124 miles, and successfully operated in space for 4 minutes before returning to earth intact. In 2006, the recovered experimental device was transferred from Los Alamos to the [[National Air and Space Museum|Smithsonian Air and Space Museum]] in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neutral Particle Beam Accelerator, Beam Experiment Aboard Rocket|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?object=nasm_A20070004000|publisher=Smithsonian Air and Space Museum|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2215">The '''Simon–Glatzel equation'''&lt;ref&gt;Simon F. E., Glatzel G., Z. Anorg. (Allg.) Chem., '''1929''', 178, 309-312&lt;/ref&gt; is an empirical correlation describing the pressure dependence of the [[Melting point|melting temperature]] of a [[solid]]. The pressure dependence of the melting temperature is small for small pressure changes because the volume change during fusion or melting is rather small. However, at very high pressures higher melting temperatures are generally observed as the liquid usually occupies a larger volume than the solid making melting more thermodynamically unfavorable at elevated pressure. If the liquid has a smaller volume than the solid (as for ice and liquid water) a higher pressure leads to a lower melting point.

== The equation ==
&lt;math&gt;T_M = T_{Ref} \left( \frac{ P_M - P_{Ref} }{a} + 1 \right)^\frac{1}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

T&lt;sub&gt;Ref&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;Ref&lt;/sub&gt; are normally the temperature and the pressure of the [[triple point]], but the normal melting temperature at atmospheric pressure are also commonly used as reference point because the normal melting point is much more easily accessible. Typically P&lt;sub&gt;Ref&lt;/sub&gt; is then set to 0. ''a'' and ''c'' are adjustable and component specific parameters.

== Example parameters ==
[[File:Simon-Glatzel equation.png|Methanol melting temperature versus pressure|thumb]]
For [[Methanol]] the following parameters&lt;ref&gt;[[Dortmund Data Bank]]&lt;/ref&gt; can be obtained:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
| a || 188158 || kPa
|-
| a || 188.158 || MPa
|-
| c || 5.15905
|-
| T&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; || 174.61 || K
|-
| T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; || 228.45 || K
|-
| P&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; || 575000 || kPa 
|-
| P&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; || 575.000 || MPa 
|}

The reference temperature has been T&lt;sub&gt;Ref&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = 174.61 K and the reference pressure P&lt;sub&gt;Ref&lt;/sub&gt; has been set to 0 kPa.

Methanol is a component where the Simon-Glatzel works well in the given validity range. The Simon–Glatzel equation cannot be used if the melting curve is falling or has maximums.&lt;ref&gt;Kechin V.V., J. Phys. Condens. Matter, '''1995''', 7, 531-535&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15035">'''Superspace''' is the coordinate space of a theory exhibiting [[supersymmetry]]. In such a formulation, along with ordinary space dimensions ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ..., there are also "anticommuting" dimensions whose coordinates are labeled in [[Grassmann number]]s rather than real numbers. The ordinary space dimensions correspond to [[boson]]ic degrees of freedom, the anticommuting dimensions to [[fermionic]] degrees of freedom.

The word "superspace" was first used by [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] in an unrelated sense to describe the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of [[general relativity]]; for example, this usage may be seen in his 1973 textbook ''[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]''.

==Informal discussion==
There are several similar, but not equivalent, definitions of superspace that have been used, and continue to be used in the mathematical and physics literature. One such usage is as a synonym for [[super Minkowski space]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sylvester James Gates|S. J. Gates, Jr.]], [[Marcus T. Grisaru|M. T. Grisaru]], [[Martin Rocek|M. Roček]], [[Warren Siegel|W. Siegel]], ''Superspace or One Thousand and One Lessons in Supersymmetry'', Benjamins Cumming Publishing (1983) {{ISBN|0-8053 3161-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, one takes ordinary [[Minkowski space]], and extends it with anti-commuting fermionic degrees of freedom, taken to be anti-commuting [[Weyl spinor]]s from the [[Clifford algebra]] associated to the [[Lorentz group]]. Equivalently, the super Minkowski space can be understood as the quotient of the [[super Poincaré algebra]] modulo the algebra of the Lorentz group. A typical notation for the coordinates on such a space is &lt;math&gt;(x,\theta,\bar{\theta})&lt;/math&gt; with the overline being the give-away that super Minkowski space is the intended space.

Superspace is also commonly used as a synonym for the [[super vector space]]. This is taken to be an ordinary [[vector space]], together with additional coordinates taken from the [[Grassmann algebra]], i.e. coordinate directions that are [[Grassmann number]]s.  There are several conventions for constructing a super vector space in use; two of these are described by Rogers&lt;ref name="rogers"&gt;[[Alice Rogers]], ''Supermanifolds: Theory and Applications'', World Scientific (2007) {{ISBN|978-981-3203-21-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and DeWitt.&lt;ref name="dewitt"&gt;[[Bryce DeWitt]], ''Supermanifolds'', Cambridge University Press (1984) {{ISBN|0521 42377 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third usage of the term "superspace" is as a synonym for a [[supermanifold]]: a supersymmetric generalization of a [[manifold]]. Note that both super Minkowski spaces and super vector spaces can be taken as special cases of supermanifolds.

A fourth, and completely unrelated meaning saw a brief usage in [[general relativity]]; this is discussed in greater detail at the bottom.

==Examples==
Several examples are given below. The first few assume a definition of superspace as a [[super vector space]].  This is denoted as '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''|''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-[[graded vector space]] with '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; as the even subspace and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as the odd subspace. The same definition applies to '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;m|n&lt;/sup&gt;.

The four-dimensional examples take superspace to be [[super Minkowski space]]. Although similar to a vector space, this has many important differences: First of all, it is an [[affine space]], having no special point denoting the origin.  Next, the fermionic coordinates are taken to be anti-commuting [[Weyl spinor]]s from the [[Clifford algebra]], rather than being [[Grassmann number]]s. The difference here is that the Clifford algebra has a considerably richer and more subtle structure than the Grassmann numbers.  So, the Grassmann numbers are elements of the [[exterior algebra]], and the Clifford algebra has an isomorphism to the exterior algebra, but its relation to the [[orthogonal group]] and the [[spin group]], used to construct the [[spin representation]]s, give it a deep geometric significance. (For example, the spin groups form a normal part of the study of [[Riemannian geometry]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Jost]], ''Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis'', Springer-Verlag (2002) {{ISBN|3-540-63654-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; quite outside the ordinary bounds and concerns of physics.)

===Trivial examples===

The smallest superspace is a point which contains neither bosonic nor fermionic directions.  Other trivial examples include the ''n''-dimensional real plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, which is a [[vector space]] extending in ''n'' real, bosonic directions and no fermionic directions.  The vector space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;0|n&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the ''n''-dimensional real [[Grassmann algebra]].  The space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1|1&lt;/sup&gt; of one even and one odd direction is known as the space of [[dual number]]s, introduced by [[William Kingdon Clifford|William Clifford]] in 1873.

===The superspace of supersymmetric quantum mechanics===
[[Supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] with ''N'' [[supercharge]]s is often formulated in the superspace '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1|2''N''&lt;/sup&gt;, which contains one real direction ''t'' identified with [[time]] and ''N'' complex [[Grassmann number|Grassmann directions]] which are spanned by  Θ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and  Θ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''i'' runs from 1 to ''N''.

Consider the special case ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  The superspace '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1|2&lt;/sup&gt; is a 3-dimensional vector space.  A given coordinate therefore may be written as a triple (''t'', Θ, Θ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;).  The coordinates form a [[Lie superalgebra]], in which the gradation degree of ''t'' is even and that of Θ and Θ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is odd.  This means that a bracket may be defined between any two elements of this vector space, and that this bracket reduces to the [[commutator]] on two even coordinates and on one even and one odd coordinate while it is an [[anticommutator]] on two odd coordinates.  This superspace is an abelian Lie superalgebra, which means that all of the aforementioned brackets vanish

:::&lt;math&gt;\left[ t,t\right]=\left[ t, \theta\right]=\left[ t, \theta^*\right]=\left\{\theta, \theta\right\}=\left\{ \theta, \theta^*\right\} =\left\{ \theta^*, \theta^*\right\}=0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; is the commutator of ''a'' and ''b'' and &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt; is the anticommutator of ''a'' and ''b''.

One may define functions from this vector space to itself, which are called [[superfield]]s. The above algebraic relations imply that, if we expand our superfield as a [[power series]] in Θ and Θ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, then we will only find terms at the zeroeth and first orders, because Θ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Θ&lt;sup&gt;*2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  Therefore, superfields may be written as arbitrary functions of ''t'' multiplied by the zeroeth and first order terms in the two Grassmann coordinates

:::&lt;math&gt;\Phi \left(t,\Theta,\Theta^* \right)=\phi(t)+\Theta\Psi(t)-\Theta^*\Phi^*(t)+\Theta\Theta^* F(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Superfields, which are representations of the [[supersymmetry]] of superspace, generalize the notion of [[tensor]]s, which are representations of the rotation group of a bosonic space.

One may then define derivatives in the Grassmann directions, which take the first order term in the expansion of a superfield to the zeroeth order term and annihilate the zeroeth order term.  One can choose sign conventions such that the derivatives satisfy the anticommutation relations

:::&lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\,,\Theta\right\}=\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta^*}\,,\Theta^*\right\}=1&lt;/math&gt;

These derivatives may be assembled into [[supercharge]]s

:::&lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}+i\Theta^*\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\quad \text{and} \quad Q^\dagger=\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta^*}+i\Theta\frac{\partial}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

whose anticommutators identify them as the fermionic generators of a [[supersymmetry]] algebra

:::&lt;math&gt;\left\{ Q,Q^\dagger\,\right\}=2i\frac{\partial}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' times the time derivative is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] operator in [[quantum mechanics]].  Both ''Q'' and its adjoint anticommute with themselves.  The supersymmetry variation with supersymmetry parameter ε of a superfield Φ is defined to be

:::&lt;math&gt;\delta_\epsilon\Phi=(\epsilon^* Q+\epsilon Q^\dagger)\Phi.&lt;/math&gt;

We can evaluate this variation using the action of ''Q'' on the superfields

:::&lt;math&gt;\left[Q,\Phi \right]=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\,+i\theta^*\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right)\Phi=\psi+\theta^*\left(F+i\dot{\phi}\right)-i\theta\theta^*\dot{\psi}.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly one may define [[covariant derivative]]s on superspace

:::&lt;math&gt;D=\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}-i\theta^*\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\quad \text{and} \quad D^\dagger=\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta^*}-i\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

which anticommute with the supercharges and satisfy a wrong sign supersymmetry algebra

:::&lt;math&gt;\left\{D,D^\dagger\right\}=-2i\frac{\partial}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;.

The fact that the covariant derivatives anticommute with the supercharges means the supersymmetry transformation of a covariant derivative of a superfield is equal to the covariant derivative of the same supersymmetry transformation of the same superfield.  Thus, generalizing the covariant derivative in bosonic geometry which constructs tensors from tensors, the superspace covariant derivative constructs superfields from superfields.

===Four-dimensional ''N'' = 1 superspace&lt;!--'Bosonic dimension', 'Bosonic dimensions', 'Grassmann dimension', 'Grassmann dimensions', 'Fermionic dimension', and 'Fermionic dimensions' redirect here--&gt;===

Perhaps the most popular superspace in [[physics]] is ''d''=4 ''N''=1 [[super Minkowski space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4|4&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of four real '''bosonic dimensions'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; and four real '''Grassmann dimensions'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also known as '''fermionic dimensions'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[[Yuval Ne'eman]], Elena Eizenberg, ''Membranes and Other Extendons (p-branes)'', World Scientific, 1995,  p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[supersymmetric]] [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] one is interested in superspaces which furnish [[group representation|representations]] of a [[Lie superalgebra]] called a [[supersymmetry algebra]].  The bosonic part of the supersymmetry algebra is the [[Poincaré algebra]], while the fermionic part is constructed using [[spinor]]s of Grassmann numbers.

For this reason, in physical applications one considers an action of the supersymmetry algebra on the four fermionic directions of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4|4&lt;/sup&gt; such that they transform as a [[spinor]] under the Poincaré subalgebra.  In four dimensions there are three distinct irreducible 4-component spinors.  There is the [[Majorana spinor]], the left-handed [[Weyl spinor]] and the right-handed Weyl spinor.  The [[CPT theorem]] implies that in a [[Unitarity (physics)|unitary]], Poincaré invariant theory, which is a theory in which the [[S-matrix]] is a [[unitary matrix]] and the same Poincaré generators act on the asymptotic in-states as on the asymptotic out-states, the supersymmetry algebra must contain an equal number of left-handed and right-handed Weyl spinors.  However, since each Weyl spinor has four components, this means that if one includes any Weyl spinors one must have 8 fermionic directions.  Such a theory is said to have [[extended supersymmetry]], and such models have received a lot of attention.  For example, supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges and fundamental matter have been solved by [[Nathan Seiberg]] and [[Edward Witten]], see [[Seiberg–Witten gauge theory]].  However, in this subsection we are considering the superspace with four fermionic components and so no Weyl spinors are consistent with the CPT theorem.

''Note'': There are many [[sign convention]]s in use and this is only one of them.

This leaves us with one possibility, the four fermionic directions transform as a Majorana spinor θ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;.  We can also form a conjugate spinor

:::&lt;math&gt;\overline{\theta}\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   i\theta^\dagger\gamma^0=-\theta^\perp C&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is the charge conjugation matrix, which is defined by the property that when it conjugates a [[gamma matrix]], the gamma matrix is negated and transposed.  The first equality is the definition of {{Overline|θ}} while the second is a consequence of the Majorana spinor condition θ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;iγ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;Cθ.  The conjugate spinor plays a role similar to that of  θ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; in the superspace '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1|2&lt;/sup&gt;, except that the Majorana condition, as manifested in the above equation, imposes that θ and θ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; are not independent.

In particular we may construct the supercharges

:::&lt;math&gt;Q=-\frac{\partial}{\partial\overline{\theta}}+\gamma^\mu\theta\partial_\mu&lt;/math&gt;

which satisfy the supersymmetry algebra

:::&lt;math&gt;\left\{Q,Q\right\}=\left\{\overline{Q},Q\right\}C=2\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu C=-2i\gamma^\mu P_\mu C&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P=i\partial_\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the 4-[[momentum]] operator.  Again the covariant derivative is defined like the supercharge but with the second term negated and it anticommutes with the supercharges. Thus the covariant derivative of a supermultiplet is another supermultiplet.

==In general relativity==
The word "superspace" is also used in a completely different and unrelated sense, in the book [[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]] by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler.  There, it refers to the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of [[general relativity]], and, in particular, the view of gravitation as [[geometrodynamics]], an interpretation of general relativity as a form of dynamical geometry. In modern terms, this particular idea of "superspace" is captured in one of several different formalisms used in solving the Einstein equations in a variety of settings, both theoretical and practical, such as in numerical simulations. This includes primarily the [[ADM formalism]], as well as ideas surrounding the [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Einstein equation]] and the [[Wheeler–DeWitt equation]].

A '''synthetic diamond''' (also known as a '''laboratory-grown diamond''', '''cultured diamond''', or '''cultivated diamond''') is a [[diamond]] produced by a controlled process, as contrasted with a [[natural diamond]] created by [[geology|geological]] processes or an [[imitation diamond]] made of non-diamond material that appears similar to a diamond. Synthetic diamond is also widely known as '''[[#High pressure, high temperature|HPHT]] diamond''' or '''[[Chemical vapor deposition|CVD]] diamond''', after the two common production methods (referring to the high-pressure high-temperature and chemical vapor deposition crystal formation methods, respectively). While the term ''synthetic'' may sometimes be associated by consumers with imitation products, synthetic diamonds are made of the same material as natural diamonds—pure carbon, crystallized in an isotropic 3D form.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081009181207/http://ftc.gov/os/2008/07/G711001jewelryguides.pdf 16 C.F.R. Part 23: Guides For The Jewelry, Precious Metals, and Pewter Industries: Federal Trade Commission Letter Declining To Amend The Guides With Respect To Use Of The Term "Cultured"], the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, July 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Trade Commission]] has indicated that the terms ''laboratory-grown'', ''laboratory-created'', and ''[manufacturer-name]-created'' "would more clearly communicate the nature of the stone".{{citation needed|date=November 2018|reason=Direct quotes should have citations}}

Numerous claims of diamond synthesis were documented between 1879 and 1928; most of those attempts were carefully analyzed but none were confirmed. In the 1940s, systematic research began in the United States, Sweden and the [[Soviet Union]] to grow diamonds using CVD and HPHT processes. The first reproducible synthesis was reported around 1955. Those two processes still dominate the production of synthetic diamond. A third method, known as [[Detonation nanodiamond|detonation]] synthesis, entered the diamond market in the late 1990s. In this process, nanometer-sized diamond grains are created in a detonation of carbon-containing explosives. A fourth method, treating graphite with high-power [[ultrasound]], has been demonstrated in the laboratory, but currently has no commercial application.

The properties of synthetic diamond depend on the details of the manufacturing processes; however, some synthetic diamonds (whether formed by HPHT or CVD) have properties such as [[hardness]], [[thermal conductivity]] and [[electron mobility]] that are superior to those of most naturally formed diamonds. Synthetic diamond is widely used in [[abrasive]]s, in cutting and polishing tools and in [[heat sink]]s. Electronic applications of synthetic diamond are being developed, including high-power [[switch]]es at [[power station]]s, high-frequency [[field-effect transistor]]s and [[light-emitting diode]]s. Synthetic diamond detectors of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light or high-energy particles are used at high-energy research facilities and are available commercially. Because of its unique combination of thermal and chemical stability, low thermal expansion and high optical transparency in a wide spectral range, synthetic diamond is becoming the most popular material for optical windows in high-power [[Carbon dioxide laser|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lasers]] and [[gyrotron]]s.  It is estimated that 98% of industrial grade diamond demand is supplied with synthetic diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zimnisky|first1=Paul|accessdate=February 4, 2013|url=http://www.resourceinvestor.com/2013/01/22/the-state-of-2013-global-rough-diamond-supply|title=The state of 2013 global rough diamond supply|publisher=Resource Investor|date=January 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128044054/http://www.resourceinvestor.com/2013/01/22/the-state-of-2013-global-rough-diamond-supply|archive-date=January 28, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both CVD and HPHT diamonds can be cut into gems and various colors can be produced: clear white, yellow, brown, blue, green and orange. The appearance of synthetic gems on the market created major concerns in the diamond trading business, as a result of which special [[optical spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] devices and techniques have been developed to distinguish synthetic and natural diamonds.

Their method involved heating [[charcoal]] at up to 3500&amp;nbsp;°C with iron inside a [[carbon]] crucible in a furnace.

He suggested that most diamonds that had been produced up to that point were likely synthetic [[spinel]].&lt;ref name=lonsdale /&gt;

=== GE diamond project ===
[[File:Beltpress.gif|thumb|left|alt=A 3-meter tall press|A belt press produced in the 1980s by [[Kobe Steel Group|KOBELCO]]]]

In 1941, an agreement was made between the [[General Electric]] (GE), Norton and Carborundum companies to further develop diamond synthesis. They were able to heat carbon to about {{convert|3000|C}} under a pressure of {{convert|3.5|GPa|lk=in}} for a few seconds. Soon thereafter, the [[Second World War]] interrupted the project. It was resumed in 1951 at the Schenectady Laboratories of GE, and a high-pressure diamond group was formed with Francis P. Bundy and H.M. Strong. [[Howard Tracy Hall|Tracy Hall]] and others joined this project shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name = makers&gt;{{cite book|author = Hazen, R. M. |title = The diamond makers|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1999|pages = 100–113| isbn = 978-0-521-65474-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Schenectady group improved on the [[diamond anvil cell|anvils]] designed by [[Percy Williams Bridgman|Percy Bridgman]], who received a [[Nobel Prize]] for his work in 1946. Bundy and Strong made the first improvements, then more were made by Hall. The GE team used [[tungsten carbide]] anvils within a hydraulic press to squeeze the carbonaceous sample held in a [[catlinite]] container, the finished grit being squeezed out of the container into a gasket. The team recorded diamond synthesis on one occasion, but the experiment could not be reproduced because of uncertain synthesis conditions,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donoghue|O'Donoghue]], p. 474&lt;/ref&gt; and the diamond was later shown to have been a natural diamond used as a seed.&lt;ref name=er&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bovenkerk|first1=H.

Hall achieved the first commercially successful synthesis of diamond on December 16, 1954, and this was announced on February 15, 1955. His breakthrough was using a "belt" press, which was capable of producing pressures above {{convert|10|GPa|abbr=on}} and temperatures above {{convert|2000|C|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hall, H.

Those metals acted as a "solvent-[[catalyst]]", which both dissolved carbon and accelerated its conversion into diamond. The largest diamond he produced was {{convert|0.15|mm|abbr=on}} across; it was too small and visually imperfect for jewelry, but usable in industrial abrasives. Hall's co-workers were able to replicate his work, and the discovery was published in the major journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bundy, F. P.; Hall, H.

=== Later developments ===
An independent diamond synthesis was achieved on February 16, 1953 in [[Stockholm]] by [[ASEA]] (Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget), one of Sweden's major electrical manufacturing companies. Starting in 1949, ASEA employed a team of five scientists and engineers as part of a top-secret diamond-making project code-named QUINTUS. The team used a bulky split-sphere apparatus designed by [[Baltzar von Platen (inventor)|Baltzar von Platen]] and Anders Kämpe.&lt;ref name = makers /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Liander, H.  |author2=Lundblad, E.  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal =ASEA Journal |title = Artificial diamonds| volume =28 |year =1955 |page= 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure was maintained within the device at an estimated 8.4&amp;nbsp;[[GPa]] for an hour. A few small diamonds were produced, but not of gem quality or size. The work was not reported until the 1980s.&lt;ref name=b31&gt;[[#Barnard|Barnard]], pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, a new competitor emerged in [[Korea]], a company named Iljin Diamond; it was followed by hundreds of Chinese enterprises. Iljin Diamond allegedly accomplished diamond synthesis in 1988 by misappropriating trade secrets from GE via a Korean former GE employee.&lt;ref&gt;General Electric v. Sung, 843 F.

[[File:Dia scalpel.jpg|thumb|alt=A diamond scalpel consisting of a yellow diamond blade attached to a pen-shaped holder|A scalpel with single-crystal synthetic diamond blade]]
Synthetic gem-quality diamond crystals were first produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a pyrophyllite tube seeded at each end with thin pieces of diamond. The graphite feed material was placed in the center and the metal solvent (nickel) between the graphite and the seeds. The container was heated and the pressure was raised to about 5.5&amp;nbsp;GPa. The crystals grow as they flow from the center to the ends of the tube, and extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around 5&amp;nbsp;mm (1 [[Carat (unit)|carat]] or 0.2 g), and the process conditions had to be as stable as possible. The graphite feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.&lt;ref name=nature1959 /&gt;

The first gem-quality stones were always yellow to brown in color because of contamination with nitrogen. [[Inclusion (mineral)|Inclusions]] were common, especially "plate-like" ones from the nickel. Removing all nitrogen from the process by adding [[aluminium]] or [[titanium]] produced colorless "white" stones, and removing the nitrogen and adding [[boron]] produced blue ones.&lt;ref name=burns&gt;{{cite journal| author= Burns, R. C.; Cvetkovic, V. and Dodge, C. N. |title =Growth-sector dependence of optical features in large synthetic diamonds| doi = 10.1016/0022-0248(90)90126-6 |journal =Journal of Crystal Growth |volume= 104 |year =1990 |pages = 257–279| issue= 2|bibcode = 1990JCrGr.104..257B | last2= Cvetkovic | last3= Dodge | last4= Evans | last5= Rooney }}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing nitrogen also slowed the growth process and reduced the crystalline quality, so the process was normally run with nitrogen present.

Although the GE stones and natural diamonds were chemically identical, their physical properties were not the same. The colorless stones produced strong [[fluorescence]] and [[phosphorescence]] under short-wavelength ultraviolet light, but were inert under long-wave UV. Among natural diamonds, only the rarer blue gems exhibit these properties. Unlike natural diamonds, all the GE stones showed strong yellow fluorescence under X-rays.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnard|Barnard]], p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The [[De Beers]] Diamond Research Laboratory has grown stones of up to {{convert|25|carat|g}} for research purposes. Stable HPHT conditions were kept for six weeks to grow high-quality diamonds of this size. For economic reasons, the growth of most synthetic diamonds is terminated when they reach a mass of {{convert|1|carat|mg}} to {{convert|1.5|carat|mg}}.&lt;ref name=bars /&gt;

In the 1950s, research started in the Soviet Union and the US on the growth of diamond by [[pyrolysis]] of hydrocarbon gases at the relatively low temperature of 800&amp;nbsp;°C. This low-pressure process is known as [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD). William G. Eversole reportedly achieved vapor deposition of diamond over diamond substrate in 1953, but it was not reported until 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Eversole, W. G.

From 2013 reports emerged of a rise in undisclosed synthetic melee diamonds (small round diamonds typically used to frame a central diamond or embellish a band)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://4cs.gia.edu/en-us/blog/melee-diamonds-tiny-diamonds-big-impact/|title=Melee Diamonds: Tiny Diamonds, Big Impact|date=April 11, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; being found in set jewelry and within diamond parcels sold in the trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industry worries about undisclosed synthetic melee|url=http://www.jckonline.com/2014/01/02/industry-worries-about-undisclosed-synthetic-melee|website=JCKOnline|publisher=jckonline.com|accessdate=May 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the relatively inexpensive cost of diamond melee, as well as relative lack of universal knowledge for identifying large quantities of melee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diamond Melee definition|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/373870/melee|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=May 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; efficiently, not all dealers have made an effort to test diamond melee to correctly identify whether it is of natural or man-made origin. However, international laboratories are now beginning to tackle the issue head-on, with significant improvements in synthetic melee identification being made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swiss lab introduces melee identifier |url=http://www.nationaljeweler.com/diamonds/grading/Swiss-lab-introduces-3328.shtml |website=[[Jewelers of America#National Jeweler|National Jeweler]] |publisher=National Jeweler |accessdate=May 10, 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910154100/http://www.nationaljeweler.com/diamonds/grading/Swiss-lab-introduces-3328.shtml |archivedate=September 10, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturing technologies ==
There are several methods used to produce synthetic diamonds. The original method uses high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) and is still widely used because of its relatively low cost. The process involves large presses that can weigh hundreds of tons to produce a pressure of 5&amp;nbsp;GPa at 1500&amp;nbsp;°C. The second method, using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), creates a carbon [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] over a substrate onto which the carbon atoms deposit to form diamond. Other methods include explosive formation (forming [[detonation nanodiamond]]s) and [[sonication]] of graphite solutions.&lt;ref name=CVD /&gt;&lt;ref name=ozawa /&gt;&lt;ref name="sonication" /&gt;

=== High pressure, high temperature ===
[[File:Hydrostatic Synthesis.png|thumb|left|alt=A schematic drawing of a vertical cross section through a press setup. The drawing illustrates how the central unit, held by dies on its sides, is vertically compressed by two anvils|Schematic of a belt press]]
In the HPHT method, there are three main press designs used to supply the pressure and temperature necessary to produce synthetic diamond: the belt press, the cubic press and the split-sphere ([[BARS (Diamonds)|BARS]]) press. Diamond seeds are placed at the bottom of the press.
The internal part of press is heated above 1400&amp;nbsp;°C and melts the solvent metal.  The molten metal dissolves the high purity [[carbon]] source, which is then transported to the small diamond seeds and [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitates]], forming a large synthetic diamond.&lt;ref name="d_lab" /&gt;

The original GE invention by Tracy Hall uses the belt press wherein the upper and lower anvils supply the pressure load to a cylindrical inner cell. This internal pressure is confined radially by a belt of pre-stressed steel bands. The anvils also serve as electrodes providing electric current to the compressed cell. A variation of the belt press uses hydraulic pressure, rather than steel belts, to confine the internal pressure.&lt;ref name="d_lab"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diamondlab.org/80-hpht_synthesis.htm |title=HPHT synthesis |publisher=International Diamond Laboratories |accessdate=May 5, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501065610/http://www.diamondlab.org/80-hpht_synthesis.htm |archive-date=May 1, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Belt presses are still used today, but they are built on a much larger scale than those of the original design.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnard|Barnard]], p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of press design is the cubic press. A cubic press has six anvils which provide pressure simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume.&lt;ref name=ito /&gt; The first multi-anvil press design was a tetrahedral press, using four anvils to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author =Hall, H.

A cubic press is typically smaller than a belt press and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the pressurized volume can be increased by using larger anvils, but this also increases the amount of force needed on the anvils to achieve the same pressure. An alternative is to decrease the surface area to volume ratio of the pressurized volume, by using more anvils to converge upon a higher-order [[platonic solid]], such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.&lt;ref name=ito&gt;{{cite book| author = Ito, E. |title = Multianvil cells and high-pressure experimental methods, in Treatise of Geophysics|editor = G.

The [[BARS apparatus]] is claimed to be the most compact, efficient, and economical of all the diamond-producing presses.

=== Chemical vapor deposition ===
[[File:Single-crystal CVD diamond disc.jpg|thumb|left|Free-standing single-crystal CVD diamond disc]]
[[Chemical vapor deposition]] is a method by which diamond can be grown from a hydrocarbon gas mixture. Since the early 1980s, this method has been the subject of intensive worldwide research. Whereas the mass-production of high-quality diamond crystals make the HPHT process the more suitable choice for industrial applications, the flexibility and simplicity of CVD setups explain the popularity of CVD growth in laboratory research. The advantages of CVD diamond growth include the ability to grow diamond over large areas and on various substrates, and the fine control over the chemical impurities and thus properties of the diamond produced. Unlike HPHT, CVD process does not require high pressures, as the growth typically occurs at pressures under 27 kPa.&lt;ref name=CVD /&gt;&lt;ref name=milos&gt;{{cite book|title =Physics and Applications of CVD Diamond|page=50; 200–240|author1=Koizumi, S. |author2=Nebel, C. E. |author3=Nesladek, M.  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher = Wiley VCH |year =2008| isbn =978-3-527-40801-6|url =https://books.google.com/?id=pRFUZdHb688C&amp;pg=RA1-PA50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CVD growth involves substrate preparation, feeding varying amounts of gases into a chamber and energizing them. The substrate preparation includes choosing an appropriate material and its crystallographic orientation; cleaning it, often with a diamond powder to abrade a non-diamond substrate; and optimizing the substrate temperature (about {{nowrap|800 °C}}) during the growth through a series of test runs. The gases always include a carbon source, typically [[methane]], and hydrogen with a typical ratio of 1:99. Hydrogen is essential because it selectively etches off non-diamond carbon. The gases are ionized into chemically active [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]] in the growth chamber using [[microwave]] power, a [[hot filament]], an [[Electric arc|arc discharge]], a [[welding torch]], a [[laser]], an [[electron beam]], or other means.

During the growth, the chamber materials are etched off by the plasma and can incorporate into the growing diamond. In particular, CVD diamond is often contaminated by silicon originating from the [[silica]] windows of the growth chamber or from the silicon substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/pssa.200561920|title=Silicon incorporation in CVD diamond layers|year=2005|author=Barjon, J. |journal=Physica Status Solidi A|volume=202|pages=2177–2181|last2=Rzepka|first2=E.|last3=Jomard|first3=F.|last4=Laroche|first4=J.-M.|last5=Ballutaud|first5=D.|last6=Kociniewski|first6=T.|last7=Chevallier|first7=J.|issue=11|bibcode = 2005PSSAR.202.2177B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, silica windows are either avoided or moved away from the substrate. Boron-containing species in the chamber, even at very low trace levels, also make it unsuitable for the growth of pure diamond.&lt;ref name=CVD&gt;{{cite journal| title =Growth and application of undoped and doped diamond films |doi =10.1088/0034-4885/61/12/002|journal =Rep.

=== Detonation of explosives ===
[[File:Detonationdiamond.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=An image resembling a cluster of grape where the cluster consists of nearly spherical particles of 5-nm diameter|Electron micrograph ([[transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]) of detonation nanodiamond]]
{{Main|Detonation nanodiamond}}
Diamond nanocrystals (5&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter) can be formed by detonating certain carbon-containing explosives in a metal chamber. These nanocrystals are called "[[detonation nanodiamond]]". During the explosion, the pressure and temperature in the chamber become high enough to convert the carbon of the explosives into diamond. Being immersed in water, the chamber cools rapidly after the explosion, suppressing conversion of newly produced diamond into more stable graphite.&lt;ref name=udd&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0925-9635(99)00354-4|title=Structure and defects of detonation synthesis nanodiamond|year=2000|author=Iakoubovskii, K. |journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=9|pages=861–865|last2=Baidakova|first2=M.V.|last3=Wouters|first3=B.H.|last4=Stesmans|first4=A.|last5=Adriaenssens|first5=G.J.|last6=Vul'|first6=A.Ya.|last7=Grobet|first7=P.J.|issue=3–6|url=http://pubman.nims.go.jp/pubman/item/escidoc:1587362:1/component/escidoc:1587361/drm861.pdf|bibcode = 2000DRM.....9..861I }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a variation of this technique, a metal tube filled with graphite powder is placed in the detonation chamber.

=== Ultrasound cavitation ===
[[micrometre|Micron]]-sized diamond crystals can be synthesized from a suspension of graphite in organic liquid at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|atmospheric pressure and room temperature]] using ultrasonic [[cavitation]]. The diamond yield is about 10% of the initial graphite weight. The estimated cost of diamond produced by this method is comparable to that of the HPHT method; the crystalline perfection of the product is significantly worse for the ultrasonic synthesis. This technique requires relatively simple equipment and procedures, but it has only been reported by two research groups, and has no industrial use {{As of|2012|lc=on}}. Numerous process parameters, such as preparation of the initial graphite powder, the choice of ultrasonic power, synthesis time and the solvent, are not yet optimized, leaving a window for potential improvement of the efficiency and reduction of the cost of the ultrasonic synthesis.&lt;ref name="sonication"&gt;{{cite journal|title =Experimental Corroboration of the Synthesis of Diamond in the Cavitation Process| doi= 10.1134/1.1710678|journal = Doklady Physics |volume= 49 |year =2004| pages= 150–153|issue=3|last1 =Galimov|first1 =É.

== Properties ==
Traditionally, the absence of crystal flaws is considered to be the most important quality of a diamond. Purity and high crystalline perfection make diamonds transparent and clear, whereas its hardness, [[optical dispersion]] (luster), and chemical stability (combined with marketing), make it a popular gemstone. High thermal conductivity is also important for technical applications. Whereas high optical dispersion is an intrinsic property of all diamonds, their other properties vary depending on how the diamond was created.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spear|Spear and Dismukes]], pp. 308–309&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crystallinity ===
Diamond can be one single, continuous crystal or it can be made up of many smaller crystals ([[polycrystal]]). Large, clear and transparent single-crystal diamonds are typically used in gemstones. Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) consists of numerous small grains, which are easily seen by the naked eye through strong light absorption and scattering; it is unsuitable for gems and is used for industrial applications such as mining and cutting tools. Polycrystalline diamond is often described by the average size (or ''[[Crystallite|grain size]]'') of the crystals that make it up. Grain sizes range from [[nanometer]]s to hundreds of [[micrometer]]s, usually referred to as "nanocrystalline" and "microcrystalline" diamond, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2g5GJtBFwo0C&amp;pg=PA136|page=136|title=Handbook of Electrochemistry|author=Zoski, Cynthia G.|publisher=Elsevier|year=2007|isbn=978-0-444-51958-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hardness ===
Synthetic diamond is the hardest known material,&lt;ref name=blank /&gt; where hardness is defined as resistance to indentation. The hardness of synthetic diamond depends on its purity, crystalline perfection and orientation: hardness is higher for flawless, pure crystals oriented to the [[Miller index#Case of cubic structures|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;111&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] direction (along the longest diagonal of the cubic diamond lattice).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=142–147|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jtC1mUFZfQcC&amp;pg=PA143|title=Properties, Growth and Applications of Diamond|author1=Neves, A.

=== Impurities and inclusions ===
{{Main|Crystallographic defects in diamond}}
Every diamond contains atoms other than carbon in concentrations detectable by analytical techniques. Those atoms can aggregate into macroscopic phases called inclusions. Impurities are generally avoided, but can be introduced intentionally as a way to control certain properties of the diamond. Growth processes of synthetic diamond, using solvent-catalysts, generally lead to formation of a number of impurity-related complex centers, involving transition metal atoms (such as nickel, cobalt or iron), which  affect the electronic properties of the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larico|first1=R.|last2=Justo|first2=J.

=== Thermal conductivity ===
Unlike most electrical insulators, pure diamond is a good conductor of heat because of the strong [[covalent bond]]ing within the crystal. The thermal conductivity of pure diamond is the highest of any known solid. Single crystals of synthetic diamond enriched in {{SimpleNuclide2|Carbon|12}} (99.9%), [[isotopically pure diamond]], have the highest [[thermal conductivity]] of any material, 30 W/cm·K at room temperature, 7.5 times higher than [[copper]].  Natural diamond's conductivity is reduced by 1.1% by the {{SimpleNuclide2|Carbon|13|link=yes}} naturally present, which acts as an inhomogeneity in the lattice.&lt;ref name=PNU&gt;{{cite journal |title =Thermal conductivity of isotopically modified single crystal diamond| journal= Phys.

Lett. |volume = 70 |year = 1993 | doi =10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.3764 |pmid=10053956 |bibcode=1993PhRvL..70.3764W |issue =24 |pages =3764–3767 |last1 =Wei |first1 =Lanhua |last2 =Kuo |first2 =P. |last3 =Thomas |first3 =R. |last4 =Anthony |first4 =T. |last5 =Banholzer |first5 =W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond's thermal conductivity is made use of by jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic thermal probe to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist of a pair of battery-powered [[thermistor]]s mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Wenckus, J. F. (December 18, 1984) "Method and means of rapidly distinguishing a simulated diamond from natural diamond" {{US patent|4488821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
=== Machining and cutting tools ===
[[File:Diamond blade very macro.jpg|thumb|alt=A polished metal slab embedded with small diamonds|Diamonds in an [[angle grinder]] blade]]

Most industrial applications of synthetic diamond have long been associated with their hardness; this property makes diamond the ideal material for [[machine tool]]s and [[Cutting tool (machining)|cutting tools]]. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond can be used to polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this ability include diamond-tipped [[drill bit]]s and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an [[abrasive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Holtzapffel, C. |title=Turning And Mechanical Manipulation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=omwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA178 |publisher=[[Holtzapffel]] |pages=176–178 |year=1856 |isbn=978-1-879335-39-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are by far the largest industrial applications of synthetic diamond. While natural diamond is also used for these purposes, synthetic HPHT diamond is more popular, mostly because of better reproducibility of its mechanical properties. Diamond is not suitable for machining [[ferrous]] [[alloy]]s at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =The application of polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tool materials when drilling and reaming aluminum-based alloys including MMC| doi =10.1016/0890-6955(95)93044-7 |journal =International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture |volume =35 |year =1995 |pages = 761–774| issue =5| last1 =Coelho| first1 =R.T.| last2 =Yamada| first2 =S.| last3 =Aspinwall| first3 =D.K.| last4 =Wise| first4 =M.L.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual form of diamond in cutting tools is micron-sized grains dispersed in a metal matrix (usually cobalt) [[sintering|sintered]] onto the tool. This is typically referred to in industry as polycrystalline diamond (PCD). PCD-tipped tools can be found in mining and cutting applications. For the past fifteen years, work has been done to coat metallic tools with CVD diamond, and though the work still shows promise it has not significantly replaced traditional PCD tools.&lt;ref name="tools"&gt;{{cite journal |title =Diamond films grown on cemented WC-Co dental burs using an improved CVD method| doi =10.1016/S0925-9635(03)00074-8 |journal =Diamond and Related Materials |volume =12| year =2003| pages= 1300–1306 |issue =8 |last1 =Ahmed |first1 =W. |last2 =Sein |first2 =H. |last3 =Ali |first3 =N. |last4 =Gracio |first4 =J. |last5 =Woodwards |first5 =R.|bibcode = 2003DRM....12.1300A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermal conductor ===
Most materials with high thermal conductivity are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond is used as a [[heat sink]] for high-power [[laser diode]]s, laser arrays and high-power [[transistor]]s. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=120 W CW output power from monolithic AlGaAs (800 nm) laser diode array mounted on diamond heatsink |author1=Sakamoto, M. |author2=Endriz, J.

=== Optical material ===
Diamond is hard, chemically inert, and has high thermal conductivity and a low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]]. These properties make diamond superior to any other existing window material used for transmitting infrared and microwave radiation. Therefore, synthetic diamond is starting to replace [[zinc selenide]] as the output window of high-power CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lasers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| pages = 303–334| title = Materials for infrared windows and domes: properties and performance| author = Harris, D.

Synthetic diamond is already used as [[semiconductor detector|radiation detection device]]. It is [[radiation hardening|radiation hard]] and has a wide [[bandgap]] of 5.5 [[electron volt|eV]] (at room temperature). Diamond is also distinguished from most other semiconductors by the lack of a stable native oxide. This makes it difficult to fabricate surface MOS devices, but it does create the potential for UV radiation to gain access to the active semiconductor without absorption in a surface layer. Because of these properties, it is employed in applications such as the [[BaBar]] detector at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator]]&lt;ref name="radiation"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bucciolini, M. |title=Diamond dosimetry: Outcomes of the CANDIDO and CONRADINFN projects|doi=10.1016/j.nima.2005.06.030|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods A|volume=552|issue=1–2|year=2005|pages=189–196|last2=Borchi|first2=E|last3=Bruzzi|first3=M|last4=Casati|first4=M|last5=Cirrone|first5=P|last6=Cuttone|first6=G|last7=Deangelis|first7=C|last8=Lovik|first8=I|last9=Onori|first9=S|bibcode = 2005NIMPA.552..189B |last10=Raffaele |first10=L. |last11=Sciortino |first11=S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and BOLD (Blind to the Optical Light Detectors for [[Ultraviolet|VUV]] solar observations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://bold.oma.be/ |title=Blind to the Optical Light Detectors|publisher=Royal Observatory of Belgium| accessdate= May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= New developments on diamond photodetector for VUV Solar Observations| journal=Semiconductor Science and Technology |volume=23|page=035026|year=2008|doi=10.1088/0268-1242/23/3/035026| issue=3|last1= Benmoussa|first1= A|last2= Soltani|first2= A|last3= Haenen|first3= K|last4= Kroth|first4= U|last5= Mortet|first5= V|last6= Barkad|first6= H A|last7= Bolsee|first7= D|last8= Hermans|first8= C|last9= Richter|first9= M|bibcode = 2008SeScT..23c5026B |last10= De Jaeger|first10= J C|last11= Hochedez|first11= J F}}&lt;/ref&gt; A diamond VUV detector recently was used in the European [[LYRA]] program.

The revised guide further states that "If a marketer uses 'synthetic' to imply that a competitor's lab-grown diamond is not an actual diamond, ... this would be deceptive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/policy/federal-register-notices/16-cfr-part-23-guides-jewelry-precious-metals-pewter-industries-1|title=16 CFR Part 23: Guides for the Jewelry, Precious Metals, and Pewter Industries: Adoption of Revised Guides|date=July 24, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MediumOrwell&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne/orwells-1984-de-beers-lobbying-the-new-ftc-lab-diamond-guidelines-e018bd92aedd|title=Orwell's '1984,' De Beers' Lobbying, &amp; the New FTC Lab Diamond Guidelines|first=Jason|last=Payne|date=July 25, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The De Beers Lightbox brand entered the market starting in September 2018. De Beers had previously limited its synthetic diamond production to industrial applications.&lt;ref name=CNNdefeat&gt;{{cite news |last=Kottasová |first=Ivana |url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/29/news/companies/de-beers-man-made-diamonds/index.html |title=De Beers admits defeat over man-made diamonds |work=[[CNN]] |date=May 29, 2018 |accessdate=May 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/311d9c3c-7eac-11e8-af48-190d103e32a4|title=De Beers U-turn on lab-grown diamonds divides industry|last=Garrahan|first=Rachel|date=September 1, 2018|work=Financial Times|access-date=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2018, the brand's website describes the diamonds as costing $200 for a quarter carat stone, $400 for a half carat, and $800 for a full carat.

The website's [[FAQ]] page says the lab-grown diamonds are "neither as valuable or precious" as natural stones.&lt;ref name=LightboxOfficial/&gt; The Lightbox branded jewelry is promoted as being "for lighter moods and lighter moments, like birthdays and beach days and just because days", and the items are provided in what ''[[The New York Times]]'' called "candy-colored cardboard gift boxes".&lt;ref name=LightboxOfficial/&gt; The Lightbox jewelry is offered for sale only directly through the website, although the site says that some partner sales locations will be added in 2019.&lt;ref name=LightboxOfficial/&gt;

'''''The Battle for Oil''''' (aka '''''Battle for Oil''''') is a 19-minute 1942 Canadian [[documentary film]], made by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) as part of the wartime ''[[Canada Carries On]]'' series. The film was produced by Raymond Spottiswoode and directed by [[Stuart Legg]].&lt;ref&gt;Lerner 1987, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;''The Battle for Oil'' describes the strategic value of oil in modern warfare. The film's [[Canadian French|French]] version title was ''La Bataille du pétrole''. {{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Synopsis ==
In 1942, consumers on the North American [[home front]] have to contend with sacrifices made in order to support the war effort. One of the restrictions is on the use of petroleum and lubricants, which results in commuters being rigidly constricted in their use of privately-owned vehicles.

These wartime rations of oil will allow the [[Allies of World War II|Aliies]] to preserve one of the most important strategic materials. From the great [[Oil field|oilfield]]s of Texas, Mexico, Venezuela and the [[Caribbean]] basin, comes the oil that feeds the Allied war effort. Military forces are deployed to protect this vital resource. The [[Royal Navy]] warships range far out to sea protect the convoys that are lifelines to the Allied cause, but are highly reliant on the oil reserves located throughout the world.{{#tag:ref|During the years leading up to the [[World War I|First World War]], British warships converted from coal to oil.|group=Note}}

The mechanized [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] war machine also relies on oil, and with limited natural supplies, Germany must manufacture costly synthetic fuels produced in 25 plants on a nonstop schedule that are constantly subjected to [[Royal Air Force]] aerial attacks. In distant battlefields, oil is the prize with Nazi armies threatening the rich oilfields of [[Baku]], with the [[Soviet Union]] desperately fighting to retain the region. The German High Command knows that the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' can stall if oil reserves are not secured.

In the Middle East, where the world's largest oil deposits are found, other oil wells and refineries are also under threat by the advancing [[Axis powers]]. The pipelines to [[Haifa]] and [[Tripoli]] and the storage tanks in Palestine where British and Soviet forces are standing guard, are under constant bombardment.

In the Far East, Japan, also dependent on foreign oil, is advancing relentlessly on the oil reserves in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and India. [[Singapore]] has become the fortress which the [[British Empire]] relies on to face the imminent onslaught of Japanese forces.

As the Allies turn to offence, oil is the lifeblood of the war effort. When the [[German battleship Bismarck]] makes a break for open sea, the oil-fuelled British [[battleship]]s and [[destroyer]]s run down and destroy the German battleship. Nightly RAF air raids also begin to take effect, but for every bombing raid to [[Berlin]], 3,800 tons of high-test fuel is needed for each [[heavy bomber]].

Global oil production continues with a new discovery in the [[Petroleum production in Canada|Turner Valley oilfield]]s in [[Alberta]] becoming significant with 1/6 of the oil in Canada coming from the new oilfield. The construction of the [[Portland–Montreal Pipe Line|Portland–Montreal Pipeline]] from [[Portland, Maine]] to [[Montreal]] refineries brings oil to Eastern Canada where ocean-going [[oil tanker]]s will then set off in [[Battle of the Atlantic|escorted convoys]] dodging the formidable German [[U-boat]]s to delivery the precious oil to the European battle front.

==Production==
Typical of the NFB's ''Canada Carries On'' series of documentary [[short film]]s, ''The Battle for Oil'' was a morale-boosting [[propaganda film]] made in cooperation with the Director of Public Information, Herbert Lash.&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/37352863/ "Recognize leadership of Winnipeg women."]''The Winnipeg Tribune'', April 18, 1941. Retrieved: March 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the format of a [[compilation documentary]], the film, edited by Stuart Legg to provide a coherent story, relied heavily on newsreel material including "enemy" footage, in order to provide the background to the dialogue.{{#tag:ref|Enemy footage was provided care of the Alien Property Custodian.|group=Note}} A NFB film crew was also dispatched to the Turner Valley oilfields in Canada.&lt;ref name="CFE"&gt;Morris, Peter.

The deep baritone voice of stage actor [[Lorne Greene]] was featured in the narration of ''The Battle for Oil''. Greene, known for his work on both radio broadcasts as a news announcer at ''[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'' as well as narrating many of the ''Canada Carries On'' series.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett 2004, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; His sonorous recitation led to his nickname, "The Voice of Canada", and to some observers, the "voice-of-God".&lt;ref name="Rist"&gt;Rist 2001, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; When reading grim battle statistics or narrating a particularly serious topic, he was known as "The Voice of Doom".&lt;ref&gt;[https://tkmorin.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/bonanzas-canadian-lorne-greene/ "Bonanza's Canadian Lorne Greene."] ''Bite Size Canada''.

==Reception==
As part of the ''Canada Carries On'' series, ''The Battle for Oil'' was produced in 35&amp;nbsp;mm for the theatrical market.&lt;ref&gt;Khouri 2007, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Each film was shown over a six-month period as part of the shorts or newsreel segments in approximately 800 theatres across Canada. The NFB had an arrangement with [[Famous Players theatres]] to ensure that Canadians from coast-to-coast could see them, with further distribution by [[Columbia Pictures]].&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;Ellis and McLane  2005, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the six-month theatrical tour ended, individual films were made available on 16&amp;nbsp;mm to schools, libraries, churches and factories, extending the life of these films for another year or two. They were also made available to film libraries operated by university and provincial authorities. A total of 199 films were produced before the series was canceled in 1959.&lt;ref name="Ohayon"&gt;Ohayon, Albert.

In a contemporary review of ''The Battle for Oil'', the ''Educational Film Library Association'' notes: "... the strategic value of oil in the present conflict is emphasized until it appears as the greatest asset any nation can possess in these days of long-range warfare." The review also describes the effective use of images, stating the oil derricks make "... a vivid impression ... riding like a defiant crown against the western sky."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.nfb.ca/sg/98030.pdf "The Educational Film Library Association offers Battle for Oil."] ''Educational Film Library Association'', 1942. Retrieved: March 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of oil was later profiled in a number of NFB documentaries including ''The Story of Oil'' (1946), ''Struggle for Oil'' (1951) and ''Oil'' (1953) as well as many other more recent productions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onf-nfb.gc.ca/en/our-collection/?idfilm=17425 "Our Collection: The Story of Oil."] ''National Film Board of Canada''.

[[File:PSM V83 D034 Two hundred year old medal affected by tin disease.png|thumb|right|225px|
&lt;center&gt;Tin medal affected by tin disease&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Tin pest''' is an [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic]], [[Allotropy|allotropic]] transformation of the element [[tin]], which causes deterioration of tin objects at low temperatures. Tin pest has also been called ''tin disease'', ''tin blight'' or ''tin leprosy'' (''lèpre d'étain'').

It was observed in [[medieval]] Europe that the pipes of [[pipe organ]]s were affected in cool climates. As soon as the tin began decomposing, the process accelerated.

With the adoption of the [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]] (RoHS) regulations in Europe, and similar regulations elsewhere, traditional lead/tin [[solder]] [[alloy]]s in electronic devices have been replaced by nearly pure tin, introducing tin pest and related problems such as [[tin whiskers]].&lt;ref&gt;A Tin Pest Failure, Journal of Failure Analysis and Prevention, {{ISSN|1547-7029}} (Print) {{ISSN|1864-1245}} (Online), Volume 9, Number 5, 10/2009, pp.461-465, Neil Douglas Burns, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/m532474k042l2353/ online abstract via ''www.springerlink.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npl.co.uk/science-technology/advanced-materials/materials-areas/electronics-interconnection/tin-pest-control Tin Pest Control] National Physical Laboratory, ''www.npl.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allotropic transformation==

At 13.2 [[Celsius|°C]] (about 56 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]) and below, pure tin transforms from the silvery, ductile metallic  [[allotropy|allotrope]] of β-form  ''white tin'' to the brittle, nonmetallic, α-form ''grey tin'' with a [[diamond cubic]] structure. The transformation is slow to initiate due to a high activation energy but the presence of [[germanium]] (or crystal structures of similar form and size) or very low temperatures of roughly −30&amp;nbsp;°C aids the initiation. There is also a large volume increase of about 27% associated with the phase change to the nonmetallic low temperature allotrope. This frequently makes tin objects (like buttons) decompose into powder during the transformation, hence the name ''tin pest''.&lt;ref&gt;Janey Levy ''Tin'', The Rosen Publishing Group, 2009, {{ISBN|1-4358-5073-4}}, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The decomposition will [[catalyst|catalyze]] itself, which is why the reaction speeds up once it starts; the mere presence of tin pest leads to {{em|more}} tin pest. Tin objects at low temperatures will simply disintegrate.

==Possible historical examples==

===Scott expedition to Antarctica===

In 1910 British polar explorer [[Robert Falcon Scott|Robert Scott]] hoped to be the first to reach the [[South Pole]], but was beaten by Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]]. On foot, the expedition trudged through the frozen deserts of the [[Antarctic]], marching for caches of food and kerosene deposited on the way in. In early 1912, at the first cache, there was no kerosene; the cans &amp;mdash; soldered with tin &amp;mdash; were empty. The cause of the empty tins could have been related to tin pest.&lt;ref name=CecilAdams /&gt; Some observers blame poor quality soldering, as tin cans over eighty years old have been discovered in Antarctic buildings with the soldering in good condition.

===Napoleon's buttons===

The story is often told of [[Napoleon]]'s men freezing in the bitter [[Russian Winter]], their clothes falling apart as tin pest ate the buttons. This clearly appears to be  an urban legend, and there is no evidence that there existed any failing buttons at all, and thus they cannot have been a contributing factor in the failure of [[French invasion of Russia|the invasion]].&lt;ref name=Ohrstrom&gt;{{cite book|last=Öhrström|first=Lars|title=The Last Alchemist in Paris|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-966109-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of the theory point out that the tin used would have been quite impure and thus more tolerant of low temperatures. Laboratory tests provide evidence that the time required for unalloyed tin to develop significant tin pest damage at lowered temperatures is about 18 months, which is more than twice the length of the invasion.&lt;ref name=CecilAdams&gt;{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Cecil |title=Did tin disease contribute to Napoleon's defeat in Russia? |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/080509.html |accessdate=17 August 2010|newspaper=[[The Straight Dope]] |date=May 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear though that some of the regiments employed in the campaign had tin buttons and that the temperature reached sufficiently low values (below −40&amp;nbsp;°C or F).&lt;ref name=Ohrstrom&gt;{{cite book|last=Öhrström|first=Lars|title=The Last Alchemist in Paris|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-966109-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, none of the many survivors' tales mention problems with buttons and it has been suggested that the legend is an amalgamation of a case of disintegrating Russian tin buttons in an army warehouse in the 1860s&lt;ref name=Fritsche&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fritsche|first=Carl|title=Ueber eigenthumlich modificirtes Zinn|journal=Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft|year=1869|volume=2|pages=112|doi=10.1002/cber.18690020156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the utterly desperate state of Napoleon's army turning soldiers into ragged beggars.&lt;ref name="Ohrstrom"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zamoyski&gt;{{cite book|last=Zamoyski|first=Adam|title=Napoleons Fatal March on Moscow.|year=2004|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern tin pest since adoption of RoHS==

With the adoption of the [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]] (RoHS) regulations in Europe and California banning most uses of [[lead]], and similar regulations elsewhere, the problem of tin pest has returned, since some manufacturers who previously used tin/lead alloys, now use pure tin. For example, the [[Lead (electronics)|leads]] of some electrical and electronic components are plated with pure tin. In cold environments, this can change to α-modification ''grey tin'', which is not [[Electrical conductivity|electrically conductive]], and falls off the leads. After reheating, it changes back to β-modification ''white tin'', which is electrically conductive, and can cause electrical [[short circuit]]s and failure of equipment. Such problems can be intermittent as the powdered particles of tin move around. Tin pest can be avoided by [[alloy]]ing with small amounts of [[electropositivity|electropositive]] metals or [[semimetal]]s soluble in tin's solid phase e.g. [[antimony]] or [[bismuth]], which prevent the decomposition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3688">A '''tree baler''' is a machine that wraps trees to allow for easier shipment and storage. Wrapped trees take up much less space and are less likely to be damaged during shipment.&lt;ref name=GCT&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Patrick|last2=Hill|first2=Lewis|title=Growing Christmas Trees|date=2015|publisher=Storey Publishing|isbn=978-1-61212-365-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the device is to replace work that previously required hand-tying individual trees, most often used at commercial [[plant nursery|nurseries]].&lt;ref name=Google&gt;{{cite web|title=Tree tyer US 6981443 B2|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US6981443|publisher=[[Google]]|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tree balers utilize a funnel, through which the tree is forced, thereby compressing the branches tight to the trunk.  The baler then wraps or ties the branches to maintain a compressed shape for shipment and storage.  Simple machines are operated manually, usually requiring one person to push the tree through the funnel and another to wrap it.  A mechanized baler does both operations and can bale over 100 trees per hour.&lt;ref name="CTPP"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wray|first1=Robert D.|title=Christmas Trees for Pleasure and Profit|date=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|pages=154–156|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Berks-Mont News]]'', the motorized [[christmas tree]] baler was invented in Pennsylvania in 1944.&lt;ref name=BerksMontNews2015-12-18/&gt;

A manual baler may also keep the branches compressed by encasing the tree in a plastic netting, rather than wrapping them with twine.  This type of baler is often used in retail sales of christmas trees to package the tree for transport by the customer.  Manual balers do not compress trees as tightly as mechanized ones.&lt;ref name=GCT/&gt;

'''Vitrification''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''vitreum'', "glass" via [[French language|French]] ''vitrifier'') is the transformation of a substance into a [[glass]],&lt;ref&gt;A.K. Varshneya. Fundamentals of inorganic glasses. Sheffield: Society of Glass Technology, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; that is to say a non-[[Crystallinity|crystalline]] [[amorphous solid]].  In the production of [[ceramics]], vitrification is responsible for its impermeability to water.&lt;ref name = doddmurfin&gt;{{cite book|first1= Arthur|last1= Dodd|first2= David|last2= Murfin|title =Dictionary of Ceramics|edition= 3rd |publisher = The Institute of Minerals|date =1994|location = London|isbn = 0901716561|url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/96201876/Dictionary-of-Ceramics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitrification is usually achieved by heating materials until they liquidize, then cooling the liquid, often rapidly, so that it passes through the [[glass transition]] to form a vitrified solid. Certain chemical reactions also result in glasses. 

In a different sense of the word, the embedding of material inside a glassy matrix is also called ''vitrification''. An important application is the [[radioactive waste#Vitrification|vitrification of radioactive waste]] to obtain a stable compound that is suitable for ultimate disposal.

In terms of [[chemistry]], vitrification is characteristic for [[amorphous]] materials or disordered systems and occurs when bonding between elementary particles ([[atoms]], [[molecules]], forming blocks) becomes higher than a certain threshold value.&lt;ref&gt;M.I. Ojovan, W.E. Lee. Connectivity and glass transition in disordered [[oxide]] systems J. Non-Cryst. Solids, 356, 2534-2540 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal fluctuations break the bonds; therefore, the lower the [[temperature]], the higher the degree of connectivity. Because of that, amorphous materials have a characteristic threshold temperature termed glass transition temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;): below T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; amorphous materials are glassy whereas above T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; they are molten.

The most common applications are in the making of [[pottery]], [[glass]], and some types of food, but there are many others, such as the vitrification of an antifreeze-like liquid in [[cryopreservation]].

==Ceramics==
Vitrification is the progressive partial fusion of a clay, or of a body, as a result of a [[Pottery#Firing|firing process]]. As vitrification proceeds the proportion of glassy bond increases and the apparent porosity of the fired product becomes progressively lower.&lt;ref name = doddmurfin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Role Of Accessory Minerals On The Vitrification Of Whiteware Compositions.' N.M.Ghoneim; E.H.Sallam; D.M. Ebrahim. Ceram.Int. 16. No.1. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Vitreous bodies have open porosity, and may be either [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] or [[Transparency and translucency|translucent]]. In this context 'zero porosity'; may be defined as less than 1% water absorption. However, various standard procedures define the conditions of water absorption.&lt;ref&gt;Whitewares: Production, Testing and Quality Control. William Ryan &amp; Charles Radford. Institute of Materials, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Methods Of Extending The Narrow Vitrification Range Of Clays.' E.V. Glass &amp; Ceramics 36, (8), 450, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Control Of Optimum Vitrification In Vitreous And Porcelain Bodies.' E.Signorini. Ceram.Inf. 26. No.301. 1991&lt;/ref&gt; An example is by [[ASTM]], who state "The term vitreous generally signifies less than 0.5% absorption. except for floor and wall tile and low-voltage [[Insulator (electricity)#Telegraph and power transmission insulators|electrical insulators]] which are considered vitreous up to 3% water absorption."&lt;ref&gt;ASTM C242-01. 'Standard Terminology Of Ceramic Whitewares and Related Products'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glazing alone does not make pottery impermeable to water. [[Porcelain]], [[bone china]] and sanitaryware are examples of vitrified pottery, and are impermeable even without glaze. [[Stoneware]] may be vitrified or semi-vitrified, the latter type would not be impermeable without glaze.&lt;ref&gt;'Body Builders.' J.Ahmed. Asian Ceramics. June 2014 {{incomplete citation|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = doddmurfin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'An Introduction To The Technology Of Pottery.' Paul Rado, Institute of Ceramics. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
When [[sucrose]] is cooled slowly it results in crystal [[sugar]] (or [[rock candy]]), but when cooled rapidly it can form syrupy [[cotton candy]] (candyfloss).

Vitrification can also occur when starting with a liquid such as water, usually through very rapid cooling or the introduction of agents that suppress the formation of [[ice]] crystals. This is in contrast to ordinary [[freezing]] which results in ice crystal formation. Additives used in [[cryobiology]] or produced naturally by organisms living in [[polar region]]s are called [[cryoprotectant]]s. Vitrification is used in [[cryo-electron microscopy]] to cool samples so quickly that they can be imaged with an electron microscope without damage.&lt;ref name="Vitrification of pure water for electron microscopy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dubochet|first1=J.|last2=McDowall|first2=A.W.|title=Vitrification of pure water for electron microscopy|journal=Journal of Microscopy|date=December 1981|volume=124|issue=3|pages=3–4|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.1981.tb02483.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cryo-EM-the first thirty years"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dubochet|first1=J.|title=Cryo-EM-the first thirty years|journal=Journal of Microscopy|date=March 2012|volume=245|issue=3|pages=221–224|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.2011.03569.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Nobel prize for chemistry was awarded for the development of this technology, which can be used to image objects such as proteins or virus particles.&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes 2017 Nobel"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/science/nobel-prize-chemistry.html|title=Nobel Prize in Chemistry Awarded for Cryo-Electron Microscopy|date=October 4, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cold-adapted [[frog]]s and some other [[ectotherm]]s naturally produce [[glycerol]] (e.g., [[southern brown tree frog]]) or [[glucose]] (e.g., [[wood frog]]) in their [[liver]]s to reduce ice formation. When glucose is used as a cryoprotectant by arctic frogs, massive amounts of glucose are released at low temperature and a special form of [[insulin]] allows for this extra glucose to enter the cells. When the frog rewarms during [[spring (season)|spring]], the extra glucose must be rapidly eliminated, but stored. Arctic [[insect]]s also use sugars as cryoprotectants. Arctic fish use [[antifreeze protein]]s, sometimes appended with sugars, as cryoprotectants.

Ordinary [[Soda-lime glass|soda-lime]] [[glass]], used in windows and drinking containers, is created by the addition of [[sodium carbonate]] and lime ([[calcium oxide]]) to [[silicon dioxide]]. Without these additives silicon dioxide will require very high temperature to obtain a melt and subsequently (with slow cooling) a glass.

Vitrification is a proven technique in the disposal and long-term storage of [[nuclear waste]] or other hazardous wastes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1 =Michael I.|last1= Ojovan|first2 = William E.|last2= Lee|title = Glassy wasteforms for nuclear waste immobilization|journal= Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A|volume= 42|issue =4|pages=  837-851|date =2011|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227332242_Glassy_Wasteforms_for_Nuclear_Waste_Immobilization |doi = 10.1007/s11661-010-0525-7|bibcode=2011MMTA...42..837O}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a method called [[geomelting]]. Waste is mixed with glass-forming chemicals in a furnace to form molten glass that then solidifies in canisters, thereby immobilizing the waste. The final waste form resembles [[obsidian]] and is a non-[[leachate|leaching]], durable material that effectively traps the waste inside. The waste can be stored for relatively long periods in this form without concern for [[air pollution|air]] or [[groundwater]] [[radioactive contamination|contamination]]. Bulk vitrification uses [[electrode]]s to melt soil and wastes where they lay buried. The hardened waste may then be disinterred with less danger of widespread contamination. According to the [[Pacific Northwest National Labs]], "Vitrification locks dangerous materials into a stable glass form that will last for thousands of years."&lt;ref name="Waste"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Waste Form Release Calculations for the 2005 Integrated Disposal Facility Performance Assessment | work = PNNL-15198 |  publisher = Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  | date = July 2005 | format = [[PDF]] | url=http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-15198.pdf 
 | accessdate = 2006-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vitrification in cryopreservation]] is used as a common method to preserve, for example, human egg cells ([[oocyte]]s) (in [[oocyte cryopreservation]]) and embryos (in [[embryo cryopreservation]]). For years, [[glycerol]] has been used in [[cryobiology]] as a cryoprotectant for blood cells and bull sperm, allowing storage at [[nitrogen|liquid nitrogen]] temperatures. However, glycerol cannot be used to protect whole [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] from damage. Instead, many biotechnology companies are researching the development of other cryoprotectants more suitable for such uses. A successful discovery may eventually make possible the bulk [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] storage (or "banking") of [[organ transplant|transplantable]] human and [[xenobiotic]] organs. A substantial step in that direction has already occurred.  [[Twenty-First Century Medicine]] has vitrified a [[rabbit]] [[kidney]] to -135&amp;nbsp;°C with their proprietary vitrification cocktail. Upon rewarming, the kidney was successfully transplanted into a rabbit, with complete functionality and viability, able to sustain the rabbit indefinitely as the sole functioning kidney.&lt;ref name="KidVit"&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors=4| author=Fahy GM| author2=Wowk B| author3=Pagotan R| author4=Chang A| author5=Phan J| author6=Thomson B| author7=Phan L | title=Physical and biological aspects of renal vitrification| journal=ORGANOGENESIS  | volume=5 | issue=3 | date=2009 | pages=167–175  | pmc=2781097 | pmid=20046680 | doi=10.4161/org.5.3.9974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, vitrification techniques have only been applied to brains ([[neurovitrification]]) by [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation|Alcor]] and to the upper body by the [[Cryonics Institute]], but research is in progress by both organizations to apply vitrification to the whole body.

'''Westmill Solar Co-operative''' is the [[industrial and provident society]] that owns the '''Westmill Solar Park''' in [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]], believed to be the largest community-owned [[photovoltaic power station]] in the world.

==Project==
The project was originally conceived by Adam Twine, the pioneer behind the neighbouring [[Westmill Wind Farm Co-operative]], built in 2011 and registered for the [[Feed-in tariffs in the United Kingdom|UK feed-in tariffs]]. It has a capacity of 5 [[Watt-peak|MW&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;]].

Westmill Solar Co-operative acquired the solar park in October 2012, under an option agreement with the original developers. It raised the necessary finance through public and private share offers and a senior debt bond with a pension fund.

==Westmill Solar Park==
Westmill solar park is in the [[United Kingdom]] located on a site of 30 [[acres]] near to [[Watchfield]], on the [[Wiltshire]]/Oxfordshire border, just off the A420. The site adjoins that of the [[Westmill Wind Farm Co-operative]].

The [[Photovoltaic power station|solar power plant]] has over 21,000 solar panels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Solar Park|url=http://www.westmillsolar.coop/projects.asp|publisher=Westmill Solar Co-operative|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been operational since July 2011.

When acquired by the Co-operative, it was the largest community-owned [[photovoltaic power station]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bredenberg|first=Al|title=British Cooperative Launches World's Largest Community-Owned Solar Park|url=http://inhabitat.com/british-cooperative-launches-worlds-largest-community-owned-solar-park/|accessdate=28 February 2013|newspaper=inhabitat|date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Co-operative membership and equity==
[[File:Westmill Solar Cooperative 1.jpg|thumb|Visitors at a Westmill Solar Co-operative Open Day at Westmill Solar Park.]]
The Co-operative invited members through a public share offer, launched in June 2012. Despite the tight timetable caused by the expiry date on the option,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodall|first=Chris|title=Bid to create world's largest community solar farm reaches funding milestone|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/27/world-largest-community-owned-solar-farm|accessdate=28 February 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the issue was 50% over-subscribed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Investors rush to get shares in community solar farm business|url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/business/9878553.Investors_rush_to_get_shares_in_community_solar_farm_business/|accessdate=28 February 2013|newspaper=Oxford Times|date=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  when it closed at the end of July. This raised £4m from c. 1,650 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members|url=http://www.westmillsolar.coop/members.asp|publisher=Westmill Solar Co-operative|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An additional c. £2m was raised by a private placement of B-Shares, mainly from members who had subscribed to the original issue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2239">[[File:Yankee Gale painting by George Thresher.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Painting of a scene during the Yankee Gale]]
The '''Yankee Gale''' was a major storm in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] near [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Canada]], that began on the night of October 3, 1851 and continued for two days. In addition to local ships, the storm wrecked much of the [[New England]] fishing fleet that was working in the waters, giving the gale its name. At least 74 ships were destroyed, and 150 crew were killed.

==General Description==
A brassy appearance was witnessed in the northwest sky on the afternoon of October 3. Long swells started moving into the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] from the southeast, as the wind began to pick up out of the same quarter. The wind backed to the northeast that evening, increasing to gale force. Surface pressures across the region begin to fall rapidly, with one barometer on Nova Scotia falling 31&amp;nbsp;hPa or mb/nearly 1&amp;nbsp;inch within 23&amp;nbsp;hours. The gales continued for nearly two days, according to one of the sea captain's logs from the area.

==Effects==
On land the cyclone had minimal effect, but out at sea the storm was significantly more damaging. Ships at sea realized a storm was approaching, and tried to sail east of [[Prince Edward Island]]. Northeast gales blocked their progress. Ships attempted to hold position, but their sails tore away in the wind and they drifted towards the island. Ships at anchor either sank at anchor or were capsized by other ships ramming them during the cyclone. Most of the American fishing fleet fell victim to the storm. At least 74 ships and 150 lives were lost. (Rousmaniere)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1821">The '''Zel'dovich number''' is a [[dimensionless number]] which provides a quantitative measure for the [[activation energy]] of a [[chemical reaction]] which appears in the [[Arrhenius law|Arrhenius]] exponent, named after the [[Russian people|Russian]] [[scientist]] [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]], who along with [[David A. Frank-Kamenetskii]], first introduced in their paper in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Forman A. "Combustion theory." (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linan, Amable, and Forman Arthur Williams. "Fundamental aspects of combustion." (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y.B. Zel’dovich and D.A. Frank-Kamenetskii,Theory  of  thermal  propagation  of  flame,Zh. Fiz. Khim+. 12 (1938), pp. 100–105.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 ICDERS meeting at [[Poitiers]], it was decided to name after Zel'dovich.&lt;ref&gt;Clavin, P. (1985). Dynamic behavior of premixed flame fronts in laminar and turbulent flows. Progress in energy and combustion science, 11(1), 1-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac {E_a} {RT_b} \cdot \frac{T_b-T_u}{T_b}&lt;/math&gt;

where 
*&lt;math&gt;E_a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[activation energy]] of the reaction
*&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gas constant]]
*&lt;math&gt;T_b&lt;/math&gt; is the burnt gas temperature
*&lt;math&gt;T_u&lt;/math&gt; is the unburnt mixture temperature.

In terms of [[heat release parameter]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, it is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{E_a}{RT_b} \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

For typical [[combustion]] phenomena, the value for Zel'dovich number lies in the range &lt;math&gt;\beta\approx 8-20&lt;/math&gt;. [[Activation energy asymptotics]] uses this number as the large parameter of expansion.

The '''Çetin Dam''' is a [[rock-fill dam]] with an asphalt-concrete core, currently being constructed on the [[Botan River]] in [[Siirt Province]], [[Turkey]]. The dam will be located directly downstream of the Botan and Büyük River confluence and have a height of {{Convert|145|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The primary purpose of the dam is [[hydroelectric]] power generation. The dam's power plant will house three 135 MW [[Francis turbine]]-generators. Also part of the Çetin project is a smaller dam {{Convert|6|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} downstream with {{Convert|45|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in height. The Çetin lower dam will regulate outflows from the Çetin main dam and also produce hydroelectric power with a 112 MW capacity via two 56 MW [[Kaplan turbine]]-generators.

The owner was the Norwegian, [[Statkraft]], at a cost of US $678 million. The Contractor was Yϋksel-iLci Joint Venture. Veidekke Industri AS was the subcontractor for Cetin dam. Of the six dams to be built on the Botan River, it will have the largest power plant. Construction on the main dam began in December 2011 and the power plant was expected to be complete in 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Çetin Hydropower Project|url=http://www.statkraft.com/Images/Faktaark%20Cetin%20ENG%2020120104%20final_tcm9-18726.pdf|publisher=Statkraft|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norway's Statkraft to build 517-MW Cetin in Turkey|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2011/09/norways-statkraft-to-build-517-mw-cetin-in-turkey.html|accessdate=19 October 2012|newspaper=Hydro World|date=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has experienced delays due to [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] attacks on the construction site and equipment.
