'''''A Checklist of Painters from c1200-1994''''' is the second edition of a book first published in 1978 by the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]]. It contains a list of names of painters, draughtsmen and engravers that are indexed in The Witt Library, named after the art historian [[Robert Witt (art historian)|Sir Robert Witt]], who bequeathed his library to the Courtauld Institute in 1952.

The purpose of the book is to provide a list of [[metadata]] on prominent painters, striving in each case to provide a common spelling for the name, nationality, and birth and death dates for Western artists from the early thirteenth century to the present. In the first version, the "present" was defined as 1976 and the list was 40,000 names long, encompassing 337 pages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/library/127789 A checklist of painters c.1200-1976] represented in the Witt Library, Courtauld Institute of Art, first edition, London, 1978 {{ISBN|0720107180}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second edition corrects mistakes made in the first edition, and lists 66,000 names collected up to 1994 and is 557 pages long.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/library/10790 A checklist of painters c.1200-1994] represented in the Witt Library, Courtauld Institute of Art, second edition, London, 1995 {{ISBN|0720121787}}&lt;/ref&gt; After publication of the second list, the Witt Library continued to collect photographic material on paintings, drawings and engravings and contains over two million reproductions of works by over 70,000 artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/research/photographic/witt/index.shtml Image Libraries: Witt Library] on The Courtauld Institute of Art website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alloenzymes''' (or also called '''allozymes''') are variant forms of an [[enzyme]] which differs structurally but not functionally from other allozymes coded for by different [[alleles]] at the same [[Locus (genetics)|locus]]. These are opposed to [[isozyme]]s, which are enzymes that perform the same function, but which are coded by genes located at different loci.&lt;ref name="Devlin Biochemistry"&gt;{{cite web |title=Allozyme Electrophoresis and Population Structure in the Snowy Campion |url=http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bsci111b/allozymes/supplemental.htm |accessdate=15 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617204344/http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bsci111b/allozymes/supplemental.htm |archive-date=2013-06-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alloenzymes are common biological [[enzyme]]s that exhibit high levels of functional [[evolutionary conservation]] throughout specific [[Phylum|phyla]] and [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]s. They are used by [[phylogeneticist]]s as molecular markers to gauge evolutionary histories and relationships between different species. This can be done because allozymes do not have the same structure. They can be separated by [[capillary electrophoresis]]. However, some species are monomorphic for many of their allozymes which would make it difficult for phylogeneticists to assess the evolutionary histories of these species.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Patricia G. ''et al.'' (March 1998). "What Molecules Can Tell Us About Populations: Choosing and Using a Molecular Marker". ''Ecology'' '''79''' (2): 361–382.&lt;/ref&gt; In these instances, phylogeneticists would have to use another method to determine the evolutionary history of a species.

These enzymes generally perform very basic functions found commonly throughout all lifeforms, such as [[DNA polymerase]], the enzyme that repairs and copies [[DNA]]. Significant changes in this enzyme reflect significant events in evolutionary history of organisms. As expected DNA polymerase shows relatively small differences in its [[amino acid]] sequence between phyla and even kingdoms.

The key to choosing which alloenzyme to use in a comparison between multiple species is to choose one that is as variable as possible while still being present in all the organisms. By comparing the amino acid sequence of the enzyme in the species, more amino acid similarities should be seen in species that are more closely related, and fewer between those that are more distantly related. The less well conserved the enzyme is, the more amino acid differences will be present in even closely related species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ableweb.org/volumes/vol-19/2-bader.pdf |title=Measuring Genetic Variability in Natural Populations by Allozyme Electrophoresis |last1=Bader |first1=James M. |publisher=Association for Biology Laboratory Education |accessdate=14 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033716/http://www.ableweb.org/volumes/vol-19/2-bader.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5339">'''Andrei Ivanovich Bogdanov''' ({{lang-ru|Андрей Иванович Богданов}}) (1692 – September 11, 1766) was one of the first  [[Russia]]n [[bibliography|bibliographers]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographers]].

Andrei Bogdanov had studied at Academician [[gimnasium]] (a gimnasium of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]). His father was a gunpowder-maker and Andrei had assisted him in his work. In 1727 according to [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great's]] edict Bogdanov began work at the field of typographical art.
&lt;!--
'''Андре́й Ива́нович Богда́нов'''в (1692 — 11 сентября 1766, [[Санкт-Петербург]]) — один из первых русских [[Библиография|книговедов]]. Учился в гимназии при [[Петербургская Академия наук|Петербургской Академии Наук]]. Отец его был мастером порохового дела и Андрей Иванович помогал ему, пока указом [[Пётр I|Петра I]] от 1719 года не был определен «в службу к типографскому художеству». Далее работал в Санкт-Петербургской типографии, а после 1727 года — в типографии Академии Наук. С 1730 года Андрей Иванович работал в библиотеке Академии наук. 

Труд Андрея Ивановича Богданова ''«Историческое, географическое и топографическое описание Санкт-Петербурга от начала заведения его, с 1703, по 1751 год»''  —  первое дошедшее до нас произведение, в котором собраны сведения по [[География|географии]], [[Топонимика|топонимике]], административной структуре, населению Санкт-Петербурга. Это по сути энциклопедия столичной жизни первой половины XVIII века.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12126">[[Image:Grassyridgebald-north1.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[Grassy Ridge Bald]] in the [[Roan Highlands]]]]
In the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of the eastern [[United States]], '''balds''' are mountain summits or crests covered primarily by thick vegetation of native grasses or shrubs occurring in areas where heavy forest growth would be expected. 

Balds are found primarily in the Southern Appalachians, where, even at the highest elevations, the climate is too warm to support an [[alpine tundra|alpine zone]], areas where trees fail to grow due to short or non-existent growing seasons.&lt;ref&gt;Peter White, "Balds," ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  The difference between an alpine summit, such as [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] in [[New Hampshire]], and a bald, such as [[Gregory Bald]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]], is that a lack of trees is normal for the colder climate of the former but abnormal for the warmer climate of the latter. One example of  southern balds' abnormality can be found at [[Roan Mountain (Roan Highlands)|Roan Mountain]], where Roan High Knob (el. 6,285 ft/1,915 m) is coated with a dense stand of [[Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest|spruce-fir forest]], whereas an adjacent summit, Round Bald (el. 5,826 ft/1,776 m), is almost entirely devoid of trees. Why some summits are bald and some are not is a mystery, though there are several hypotheses.

==Types==
[[Image:Gregory-bald-northeast1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Clear vistas make grassy balds attractive to hikers]]
Two types of balds are found in the Appalachians:  

===Grassy balds===
'''Grassy balds''' are relatively blunt summits covered by a dense sward of native grasses. Two types have been identified: those completely covered by grasses and those with a scattered overstory of [[deciduous forest|mixed hardwood]]s with a grassy [[herbaceous layer]]. Grassy balds are normally found at the summit of hills, but can also be found on broad upper slopes.&lt;ref name="Peter White 2006"&gt;Peter White, "Balds," ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Species found here include mountain oat-grass (''[[Danthonia compressa]]''), sedges (''[[Carex]] brunnescens'' ssp. sphaerostachya, ''[[Carex]] debilis''  var. rudgei, ''[[Carex pensylvanica]]''), and [[forb]]s such as three-toothed cinquefoil (''[[Sibbaldiopsis|Sibbaldiopsis tridentata]]'') and Blue Ridge St. Johns-wort (''[[Hypericum]] mitchellianum'').&lt;ref name="vaDcr"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heath balds===
'''Heath balds''' are typically found along narrow ridges and mountain crests, and consist of dense evergreen shrubs.  While the formation of grassy balds is a mystery, heath balds are often located in areas where the soil experiences heavy drainage or is highly acidic, which would complicate the growth of large wooded plants.&lt;ref name="Peter White 2006"/&gt; 

Four general types of vegetation are found on heath balds:
* Evergreen shrublands of Catawba rhododendron (''[[Rhododendron catawbiense]]'')&lt;ref name = "vaDcr"/&gt;
* Mixed shrublands of Catawba rhododendron, mountain-laurel (''[[Kalmia latifolia]]''), and black huckleberry (''[[Gaylussacia baccata]]'')&lt;ref name = "vaDcr"/&gt;
* Deciduous shrublands of American mountain-ash (''[[Sorbus americana]]''), minniebush (''[[Menziesia]] pilosa''), and southern mountain-cranberry (''[[Vaccinium erythrocarpum]]'')&lt;ref name = "vaDcr"/&gt;
* Deciduous shrubland of smooth blackberry (''[[Rubus]] canadensis'')&lt;ref name = "vaDcr"/&gt;

==Origin and dynamics==

The character and distribution of Appalachian balds remained stable from the time the first naturalists explored the region, until forestry regulations no longer permitted annual pasturing of local cattle. How and why a summit develops into a grassy bald is unknown; they represent "an ecological enigma and a conservation dilemma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter D. |last=Weigl |first2=Travis W. |last2=Knowles |year=1995 |title=Megaherbivores and Southern Appalachian Grass Balds |journal=Growth and Change |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=365–382 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2257.1995.tb00176.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Weigl and Knowles note that "the presence of both rare, endemic plants and northern relicts requiring open habitat suggests a long evolutionary history" and offer a scenario in which grazing pressure of the giant herbivores of the [[Pleistocene]] retained the open [[tundra]] habitat as the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] retreated far to the north. With the arrival of the [[paleoindians]] and the disappearance of the [[megaherbivore]]s, grazing pressure was maintained by deer and elk, and then by the grazing animals of European settlers. Some recent studies have attempted to uncover the vegetation history of some balds through analysis of the soil's organic component, since grasses leave a characteristic [[carbon-13]] fingerprint.&lt;ref&gt;Knoepp, Jennifer D.; Tieszen, Larry L.; Fredlund, Glen G. (1998). ''Assessing the vegetation history of three Southern Appalachian balds through soil organic matter analysis''  Res. Pap. SRS-13. Asheville, NC: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Southern Research Station. 12 p&lt;/ref&gt;  While there is some evidence that grassy balds have natural origins, the forest quickly started to reclaim the balds once large-scale livestock grazing was eliminated by the creation of national parks and national forests.  Grassy balds such as [[Gregory Bald]] and [[Andrews Bald]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park|Great Smokies]] and the balds in the [[Roan Highlands]] are currently maintained as bald areas by the National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service.&lt;ref&gt;Peter White, "Balds," ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville:  University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The mountaintop meadows called the ''Southern Balds'' form a distinctive stretch for hikers of the [[Appalachian Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.asp?trailid=HGD044-001 Appalachian Trail: Southern Balds Section] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091518/http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.asp?trailid=HGD044-001 |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[molecular biology]], '''biochips''' are essentially miniaturized laboratories that can perform hundreds or thousands of simultaneous biochemical reactions. Biochips enable researchers to quickly screen large numbers of biological analytes for a variety of purposes, from disease diagnosis to detection of [[bioterrorism]] agents. '''Digital microfluidic biochips'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.ee.duke.edu/~krish/a16-su.pdf|title=High-Level Synthesis of Digital Microfluidic Biochips|publisher=Duke University}}&lt;/ref&gt; have become one of the most promising technologies in many biomedical fields. In a digital microfluidic biochip, a group of (adjacent) cells in the microfluidic array can be configured to work as storage, functional operations, as well as for transporting fluid droplets dynamically.

==History==
The development started with early work on the underlying [[sensor]] technology. One of the first portable, chemistry-based sensors was the [[glass electrode|glass pH electrode]], invented in 1922 by Hughes.&lt;ref&gt;W. S. Hughes, "The potential difference between glass and electrolytes in contact with water," ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' 44, pp.&amp;nbsp;2860–2866, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;  In subsequent years. For example, a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor was produced by incorporating [[valinomycin]] into a thin membrane.&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Schultz and R. F. Taylor in ''Handbook of Chemical and Biological Sensors'', J. S. Schultz and R. F. Taylor, eds., ch. Introduction to Chemical and Biological Sensors, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–10, Institute of Physics Publishing, Philadelphia, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]] announced their discovery of the now familiar [[double helix]] structure of [[DNA]] molecules and set the stage for [[genetics]] research that continues to the present day.&lt;ref name=Nelson&gt;D. L. Nelson and M. M. Cox, ''Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry'', Worth Publishers, New York, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[sequencing]] techniques in 1977 by [[Walter Gilbert|Gilbert]]&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Maxam and W. Gilbert, "A new method for sequencing DNA," ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' 74, pp.&amp;nbsp;560–564, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frederick Sanger|Sanger]]&lt;ref&gt;F. Sanger, S. Nicklen, and A. R. Coulson, "DNA sequencing with chainterminating inhibitors," ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' 74, pp.&amp;nbsp;5463–5467, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; (working separately) enabled researchers to directly read the genetic codes that provide instructions for [[protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]]. This research showed how [[hybridisation (molecular biology)|hybridization]] of complementary single [[oligonucleotide]] strands could be used as a basis for DNA sensing. Two additional developments enabled the technology used in modern DNA-based. First, in 1983 [[Kary Mullis]] invented the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technique,&lt;ref name=Nelson/&gt; a method for amplifying DNA concentrations. This discovery made possible the detection of extremely small quantities of DNA in samples. Secondly in 1986 Hood and co-workers devised a method to label DNA molecules with [[fluorescent tag]]s instead of radiolabels,&lt;ref&gt;L. M. Smith, J. Z. Sanders, R. J. Kaiser, P. Hughes, C. Dodd, C. R. Connell, C. Heiner, S. B. H. Kent, and L. E. Hood, "Fluorescence detection in automated DNA sequence analysis," ''Nature'' 321, pp.&amp;nbsp;61–67, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; thus enabling hybridization experiments to be observed optically.

[[image:Biochip platform.jpg|frame|thumb right|300 px|Figure 1. Biochips are a platform that require, in addition to microarray technology, transduction and signal processing
technologies to output the results of sensing experiments.]]
Figure 1 shows the make up of a typical biochip platform. The actual sensing component (or "chip") is just one piece of a complete analysis system. [[Transducer|Transduction]] must be done to translate the actual sensing event (DNA binding, [[redox|oxidation/reduction]], ''etc.'') into a format understandable by a computer ([[voltage]], light intensity, mass, ''etc.''), which then enables additional analysis and processing to produce a final, [[human-readable]] output. The multiple technologies needed to make a successful biochip&amp;mdash;from sensing chemistry, to [[microarray]]ing, to signal processing&amp;mdash;require a true multidisciplinary approach, making the barrier to entry steep. One of the first commercial biochips was introduced by [[Affymetrix]]. Their "GeneChip" products contain thousands of individual DNA sensors for use in sensing defects, or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in genes such as [[p53]] (a tumor suppressor) and [[BRCA1]] and [[BRCA2]] (related to breast cancer).&lt;ref&gt;P. Fortina, D. Graves, C. Stoeckert, Jr., S. McKenzie, and S. Surrey in ''Biochip Technology'', J. Cheng and L. J. Kricka, eds., ch. Technology Options and Applications of DNA Microarrays, pp.&amp;nbsp;185–216, Harwood Academic Publishers, Philadelphia, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The chips are produced using [[microlithography]] techniques traditionally used to fabricate [[integrated circuit]]s (see below).

==Microarray fabrication==
[[File:Sarfus.DNABiochip.jpg|thumb|300px|3D [[Sarfus]] image of a DNA biochip]]
The microarray&amp;mdash;the dense, two-dimensional grid of biosensors&amp;mdash;is the critical component of a biochip platform. Typically, the sensors are deposited on a flat substrate, which may either be passive (''e.g.'' silicon or glass) or active, the latter
consisting of integrated electronics or [[microtechnology|micromechanical]] devices that perform or assist signal transduction. [[Surface chemistry]] is used to [[covalent bond|covalently bind]] the sensor molecules to the substrate medium. The fabrication of microarrays is non-trivial and is a major economic and technological hurdle that may
ultimately decide the success of future biochip platforms. The primary manufacturing challenge is the process of placing each sensor at a specific position (typically on a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] grid) on the substrate. Various means exist to achieve the placement, but typically robotic micro-pipetting&lt;ref&gt;M. Schena, D. Shalon, R. W. Davis, and P. O. Brown, "Quantitative monitoring of gene expression patterns with a complementary DNA microarray," ''Science'' 270, pp.&amp;nbsp;467–470, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; or micro-printing&lt;ref&gt;G. MacBeath, A. N. Koehler, and S. L. Schreiber, "Printing small molecules as microarrays and detecting protein-ligand interactions en masse," ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' 121, pp.&amp;nbsp;7967–7968, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; systems are used to place tiny spots of sensor material on the chip surface. Because each sensor is unique, only a few spots can be placed at a time. The low-throughput nature of this
process results in high manufacturing costs.

Fodor and colleagues developed a unique fabrication process (later used by [[Affymetrix]]) in which a series of microlithography steps is used to [[Combinatorial chemistry|combinatorially synthesize]] hundreds of thousands of unique, single-stranded DNA sensors on a substrate one [[nucleotide]] at a time.&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Fodor, J. L. Read, M. C. Pirrung, L. Stryer, A. T. Lu, and D. Solas, "Light-directed, spatially addressable parallel chemical analysis," ''Science'' 251, pp.&amp;nbsp;767–773, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Pease, D. Solas, E. J. Sullivan, M. T. Cronin, C. P. Holmes, and S. P. Fodor, "Light-generated oligonucleotide arrays for rapid DNA sequence analysis," ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' 91, pp.&amp;nbsp;5022–5026, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  One lithography step is needed per base type; thus, a total of four steps is required per nucleotide level. Although this technique is very powerful in that many sensors can be created simultaneously, it is currently only feasible for creating short DNA strands (15&amp;ndash;25 nucleotides). Reliability and cost factors limit the number of photolithography steps that can be done. Furthermore, light-directed combinatorial synthesis techniques are not currently possible for proteins or other sensing molecules.

As noted above, most microarrays consist of a Cartesian grid of sensors. This approach is used chiefly to map or "encode" the coordinate of each sensor to its function. Sensors in these arrays typically use a universal signalling technique (''e.g.'' fluorescence), thus making coordinates their only identifying feature. These arrays must be made using a serial process (''i.e.'' requiring multiple, sequential steps) to ensure that each sensor is placed at the correct position.

"Random" fabrication, in which the sensors are placed at arbitrary positions on the chip, is an alternative to the serial method. The tedious and expensive positioning process is
not required, enabling the use of parallelized self-assembly techniques. In this approach, large batches of identical sensors can be produced; sensors from each batch are then combined and assembled into an array. A non-coordinate based encoding scheme must be used to identify each sensor. As the figure shows, such a design was first demonstrated (and later commercialized by Illumina) using functionalized beads placed randomly in the wells of an etched [[fiber optic]] cable.&lt;ref&gt;F. J. Steemers, J. A. Ferguson, and D. R. Walt, "Screening unlabeled DNA targets with randomly-ordered fiber-optic gene arrays," ''Nature Biotechnology'' 18, pp.&amp;nbsp;91–94, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. L. Michael, L. C. Taylor, S. L. Schultz, and D. R. Walt, "Randomly ordered addressable high-density optical sensor arrays," ''Analytical Chemistry'' 70, pp.&amp;nbsp;1242–1248, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Each bead was uniquely encoded with a fluorescent signature. However, this encoding scheme is limited in the number of unique dye combinations that can be used and successfully differentiated.

==Protein biochip array and other microarray technologies==
[[Microarray]]s are not limited to [[DNA]] analysis; [[protein microarray]]s, [[antibody microarray]], [[chemical compound microarray]] can also be produced using biochips.  Randox Laboratories Ltd. launched Evidence, the first protein Biochip Array Technology analyzer in 2003.  In protein Biochip Array Technology, the biochip replaces the [[ELISA]] plate or [[cuvette]] as the reaction platform.  The biochip is used to simultaneously analyze a panel of related tests in a single sample, producing a [[patient]] profile.  The patient profile can be used in disease screening, [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], monitoring disease progression or monitoring treatment.  Performing multiple analyses simultaneously, described as multiplexing, allows a significant reduction in processing time and the amount of patient sample required.  Biochip Array Technology is a novel application of a familiar methodology, using sandwich, competitive and antibody-capture [[immunoassay]]s. The difference from conventional immunoassays is that, the capture ligands are covalently attached to the surface of the biochip in an ordered array rather than in solution.

In sandwich assays an enzyme-labelled antibody is used; in competitive assays an enzyme-labelled antigen is used.  On antibody-antigen binding a [[chemiluminescence]] reaction produces light.  Detection is by a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) camera.  The CCD camera is a sensitive and high-resolution sensor able to accurately detect and quantify very low levels of light.  The test regions are located using a grid pattern then the chemiluminescence signals are analysed by imaging software to rapidly and simultaneously quantify the individual analytes.

Biochips are also used in the field of [[microphysiometry]] e.g. in skin-on-a-chip&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, F., Eggert, S., Wiest, J.: Skin-on-a-chip: Transepithelial electrical resistance and extracellular acidification measurements through an automated air-liquid interface, Genes, 2018, 9/2, 114; doi:10.3390/genes9020114&lt;/ref&gt; applications.

[[File:Hogtie suspension bondage.jpg|thumb|250px|A suspended model in a [[hogtie bondage]]. Her nipples are also clamped and she is [[Gag (BDSM)|gagged]].]]

'''Bondage''' is the practice of [[consent|consensually]] tying, binding, or restraining a partner for [[erotic]], [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], or [[somatosensory system|somatosensory stimulation]]. A partner may be [[physical restraint|physically restrained]] in a variety of ways, including the use of [[rope]], [[Handcuffs|cuffs]], [[bondage tape]], or [[self-adhering bandage]].

Bondage itself does not necessarily imply [[sadomasochism]]. Bondage may be used as an end in itself, as in the case of [[rope bondage]] and [[breast bondage]]. It may also be used as a part of [[human sexual behavior|sex]] or in conjunction with other [[BDSM]] activities. The letter "B" in the acronym "BDSM" comes from the word "bondage". [[Sexuality]] and [[erotica]] are an important aspect in bondage, but are often not the end in itself. Aesthetics also plays an important role in bondage.

A common reason for the active partner to tie up their partner is so both may gain pleasure from the restrained partner's submission and the feeling of the temporary transfer of control and power. For [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] people, bondage is often used as a means to an end, where the restrained partner is more accessible to other sadomasochistic behaviour. However, bondage can also be used for its own sake. The restrained partner can derive sensual pleasure from the feeling of helplessness and immobility, and the active partner can derive visual pleasure and satisfaction from seeing their partner tied up.

== Bedroom ==
Many couples incorporate bondage into their sex lives, often sporadically but sometimes more regularly, and find sexual bondage to be relationship-affirming.&lt;ref name="Keesling"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sexual Pleasure: Reaching New Heights of Sexual Arousal &amp; Intimacy |last=Keesling |first=Barbara |authorlink= |author2= |year=1993 |publisher=[[Hunter House Publishers]] |location= |isbn=978-0-89793-148-9 |page=167 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sometimes takes the form of a [[Sexual roleplay|sex game]] or [[sexual fantasy]] enactment. Bedroom bondage games are commonly used as a form of [[foreplay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Come Hither: A Commonsense Guide to Kinky Sex |last=Brame |first=Gloria G. |authorlink= |author2= |year=2000 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location= |isbn=978-0-684-85462-5 |page=22 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They require and imply a level of trust and a surrender of control by the restrained to the active partner.&lt;ref name="Keesling" /&gt; The restrained partner (called a ''submissive'') surrenders control to the other partner (called a ''dominant''). This surrender of control happens voluntarily and under mutual understanding and consent.

The main feature of sexual bondage is that it renders the restrained person vulnerable to a variety of sex acts. The restrained partner is dependent for their sexual satisfaction on the actions of their partner, who may treat the restrained partner as their [[sex object]].

There are many reasons why people allow themselves to be bound. Some people feel a kind of freedom during corporal passivity, they can concentrate on their inner spirituality and feel at peace, as a participant in a study about motivation for bondage explained: "Some people have to be tied up to be free".&lt;ref&gt;Apostolides, Marianne: ''The Pleasure of Pain: Find out why one in 10 of us is into S&amp;M''. In: ''Psychology Today'', September/October 1999, ISSN 0033-3107.&lt;/ref&gt; Others experience helplessness, struggle against their bonds, and feel a degree of masochistic pleasure from the restraint and pain, as well as being unobstructed for erotic stimulation by their partner.

Bondage can be relatively simple to apply, enabling improvisation using household items and little experience. Bedroom bondage is usually mild bondage, with one partner voluntarily being put into restraints by being tied up or handcuffed. [[Blindfold]]s are a common part of bedroom play. The restrained partner is then typically [[sexual stimulation|sexually stimulated]] by [[masturbation]], [[Fingering (sex act)|fingering]], [[oral sex]], a [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]], or [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]]. Bondage can also be used for purposes other than sexual foreplay. For example, it may be used in [[Tickling fetishism|erotic tickling]] or for [[sexual teasing]].

The free partner may derive [[erotic]] pleasure or achieve [[sexual arousal]] from being in a dominant situation, while the tied partner may achieve arousal from being in a largely "helpless" position in the hands of a trusted partner. Either way, the partners are usually playing out bondage games to act out their [[sexual fantasies]].&lt;ref name="Keesling" /&gt;

In 1995, [[psychologist]]s [[Kurt Ernulf]] and [[Sune Innala]] from [[Sweden]] published an analysis based on answers from members of the bondage-oriented [[Usenet]] group ''[[alt.sex.bondage]]''. Most of the answers (76%) were from men. In 71% of the answers the active (restraining) role in bondage was played by heterosexual men, in 11% by heterosexual women and in 12% by homosexual men. 29% of the heterosexual men, 89% of the heterosexual women and 88% of the homosexual men played the passive (restrained) role. A third of the people who answered said they practised bondage in connection with [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] activities or at least thought bondage and sadomasochism belonged together.&lt;ref&gt;Ernulf, Kurt E.; Innala, Sune M.: ''Sexual Bondage: A Review and Unobtrusive Investigation''. In: ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 24, issue 6, 1995, pp. 631–654.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of American students conducted by a magazine in 1996, 24% of the people who replied claimed to have sexual fantasies involving bondage. This was claimed by 40% of the homosexual and bisexual men, 32% of the lesbian and bisexual women, 24% of the heterosexual women and 21% of the heterosexual men. 48% of the lesbian and bisexual women, 34% of the homosexual and bisexual men, and 25% of the heterosexual men and women had had practical experiences of bondage.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Leland; Brantley, Cynthia: ''Sex on Campus''. [[Random House]], New York 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey conducted in the USA in 1985, about half of the men considered bondage erotic,&lt;ref&gt;Breslow, Norman; Evans, Linda; Langley, Jill: ''On the Prevalence and Roles of Females in the Sadomasochistic Subculture: Report of an Empirical Study''. In: ''Archives of Sexual Behavior''. 14/1985, pp. 303–317.&lt;/ref&gt; but according to the 1993 publication ''Janus Report on Sexual Behavior'', only 11% of the representatives had had practical experiences of bondage.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia, L.; Samuel, S.: ''The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior''. Wiley, New York 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Because of the diversity in its forms, bondage can be divided into various different types based on its motivation.
[[File:Alsana Sin by ropemarks.jpg|thumb|[[Rope bondage]]: A [[Gag (BDSM)|gagged]] model bound in an uncomfortable position using [[breast bondage]] and [[crotch rope]]s]]

===Bondage for a purpose===
This form of bondage is the best known in BDSM, and denotes restraining the passive partner for an ulterior purpose, such as making them more accessible for a [[erotic spanking|spanking]] session. Bondage for its own sake is not considered in this category.&lt;ref name="Papiertiger"&gt;[http://www.datenschlag.org/papiertiger/lexikon/fesselspiele.html ''Fesselspiele''] in ''Der Papiertiger'', a BDSM encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decorative bondage===
In this form of bondage, the restrained partner is bound for a decorative purpose, to be used as an aesthetic object, for example for erotic photography, or a form of [[human furniture]] in a BDSM party.&lt;ref name="Papiertiger"/&gt;

===Torture bondage===

In this form of bondage, the restrained partner is purposefully bound in an uncomfortable or painful position, for example as a punishment in connection of a dominant/submissive sexual play. Almost any form of bondage, when the restrained partner is left tied up long enough, can be used as torture bondage. How long this punitive form of bondage is used for varies greatly, however in bondage erotica such as [[John Willie]]'s ''[[Sweet Gwendoline]]'' or [[Japanese bondage]] photography, it is often extensive and long-lasting.

===Film bondage===
Film bondage is a form of completely non-violent bondage for aesthetic purposes only. In this form of bondage, the restrained partner is bound lightly and is capable of escaping without great effort.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Kroll|Kroll, Eric]]: ''Fetish Girls''. [[Taschen]], 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meditative bondage===
This form of bondage is seldom used in western bondage. However, in Japanese bondage ({{lang-ja|shibari}}), it is an important aspect, possibly originally having evolved from a religious tradition, where the interest is in the restrained partner's spiritual situation rather than their corporal situation.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Califia: ''Sensuous Magic: A Guide for Adventurous Lovers''. Mass Market Paperback, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public==
[[File:Woman topless on leash at Folsom Street Fair 2012.jpg|thumb|right|[[Petplay]]: Woman bound using a dog's chain at [[Folsom Street Fair]]]]
[[File:Folsom 2003 bondage demo cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Bondage demonstration at the 2003 [[Folsom Street Fair]].]]
A [[subculture]] of [[gay men]], sometimes called [[Leather subculture|leathermen]], were among the first groups to make obvious hints of their tastes in bondage in public. Other groups, including pansexual and heterosexual BDSM enthusiasts, later followed suit. Early public displays were mainly limited to the wearing of certain fashion items, such as collars and cuffs.

Over time, more explicit public displays arose. The most prominent examples are LGBT street fairs, such as the famous [[Folsom Street Fair]]. These events are few in number and highly controversial in most regions.

[[Exhibitionism|Exhibitionist]] displays are another manifestation of public bondage. They are typically undertaken by individuals who fetishize public displays of sex and sexuality. However, some exhibitionist bondage is done as a social or political statement. This could be an effort to raise awareness of alternative sexuality or a political metaphor for oppression.

BDSM clubs feature semi-public bondage. While the clubs and events are considered private, play parties feature open spaces where play occurs that allows other attendees to watch scenes in progress. Public play of this variety is more rooted in social activity and the safe space afforded by such clubs than exhibitionist fetishism.

==BDSM==
Bondage features prominently in [[BDSM scene]]s and [[sexual roleplay]]. It is the best known aspect of BDSM even outside the BDSM scene, and does not require a BDSM-oriented sexual identity to practice. Even so-called "vanilla" people can become masters of the technical aspects of tying their partners up.

Bondage has a sexual appeal to people of all sexes and all [[sexual orientation]]s, in a [[switch (BDSM)|switch]], [[dominance and submission|dominant (top) or submissive (bottom)]] role.

There are also some common fantasy settings in which bondage may be a component. These include:
* [[Rape fantasy|Rape, ravishment or abduction]]: The top fictitiously seizes or abducts the consenting bottom and has complete control.
* Dominance/submission: A training session occurs in which rewards for obedience and punishment for defiance are given. [[Erotic humiliation|Humiliation]] is usually involved.
* [[Predicament bondage]]: The bottom is given a choice between two tortures. For example, caning on the rear or flogging on the chest. If the bottom cannot stand one any longer, the top will start the other. This can also be done mechanically, like having a bottom squat and rigging a crotch rope to tighten if they attempt to stand.

Bondage is often combined with other sexual and BDSM techniques.

[[Self-bondage]] is more complex, and may involve special techniques to apply bondage to oneself, and also to effect a release after a lapsed period of time. Self-bondage is also notably risky: see the safety notes below. [[File:3 Layer Gag.ogv|thumb|Self-gagging]]

[[File:A Blue Coloured Monoglove style Armbinder.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|A woman wearing an [[armbinder]].]]
A large variety of [[bondage equipment]] is available for use in BDSM scenes for a number of results. These include rope, straps, or harnesses which can be used to hold limbs together; [[spreader bar]]s, [[Saint Andrew's Cross (BDSM)|x-frames]] which can be used to keep limbs apart; the body or limbs can be tied to an object, such as to chairs or stocks; the body may be suspended from another object, as in [[suspension bondage]]; or it may used to restrict normal movement, such as use of [[hobble skirt]]s, [[handcuff]]s, or [[human pony|pony]] harness. Bondage may also be used to wrap the whole body or a part of it in bindings, such as cloth or plastic (saran wrap or cling film "mummification") as well as [[sleepsack (BDSM)|sleepsack]] bondage.

One of the purposes of bondage in BDSM is to restrain a person (typically called the [[Bottom (BDSM)|bottom]]) in a [[BDSM position]]. This may involve simply tying the hands together in front or behind. Other positions involve the use of a waist belt to anchor the hands to the front, back or sides. Other popular positions are the [[spreadeagle (position)|spread eagle]], with the limbs splayed out and fastened by wrists and ankles to bedposts, door frame or some other anchoring point; the [[hogtie bondage|hogtie]], which secures each wrist to its corresponding ankle behind the back (wider, padded restraints such as [[bondage cuffs]] are recommended for this); the [[balltie]], which secures wrists to ankles, in front, with the knees drawn up to the chest; the [[crotch rope]], which involves pulling a rope between the labia to apply pressure to the female genitals. Sometimes a knot is placed in the rope at the position of the clitoris to intensify the sensation. A crotch rope can also be used on males, either placing pressure directly on the scrotum or including a tie to capture the scrotum. Other positions include the [[reverse prayer position]] (not recommended unless the subject has flexible shoulders), and an [[over-arm tie]], in which the arms are brought over the head, and the wrists fastened together behind the head and then by a length of rope, chain or strapping to a belt at the waist.

The types of restraints used in bondage include [[rope]], which is often preferred because of its flexibility. [[bondage rigger|Rigging]], however, requires considerable skill and practice to do safely. Other types of restraints include chains, [[handcuff]]s, [[thumbcuffs]] and [[belly chains]]. Institutional restraints, such as [[straitjacket]]s may be used in some roleplays, and purpose-made bondage gear, such as [[monoglove]]s, [[sleepsack (BDSM)|sleepsacks]], [[bondage hook]]s and [[bondage table]]s, are also available.

Some BDSM [[play party (BDSM)|play parties]] offer "bondage workshops", where couples, or people otherwise consenting with each other, can practice tying under the instruction and supervision of an experienced [[bondage rigger]].

== Safety ==
[[File:Gefährdete Regionen in der Grundhaltung einer klassischen Oberkörperbondage.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Areas vulnerable to damage in classic upper body bondage are marked out in red.]]
Bondage is safer when conducted between sober, trusted partners who are fully aware of the risks involved and the precautions necessary to ensure safety, such as informed consent. Partners who are in committed relationships may have a greater basis for trusting each other. Performing acts in a supervised location, such as a [[dungeon (BDSM)|dungeon]], or with a group of trusted friends may also increase safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fetish.com/community/magazine/bdsm-toys/dungeon-bondage-beginners-caning-bench|title=Beginners Guide - Dungeon Bondage: Caning Benches &amp; Spanking|author=|date=|website=Fetish.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a subculture of people who seek out others interested in bondage and pursue such activities with people who they do not know well. This subculture has given rise to Safe, Sane &amp; Consensual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=|title=Safe Sane Consensual|url=http://kinkweekly.com/ssc/|magazine=Kink Weekly|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precautions===

Safety precautions include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Erotic Bondage Handbook |last=Wiseman |first=Jay |authorlink=Jay Wiseman |author2= |year=2000 |publisher=[[Greenery Press]] |location=Oakland, CA |isbn=1-890159-13-1 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The use of a "[[safeword]]", or some clear way for the subject to indicate genuine distress and a wish to discontinue, temporarily stop or vary the activities of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Philip; Devon, Molly: ''Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns: The Romance and Sexual Sorcery of Sadomasochism''. 1st edition, [[Mystic Rose Books]], 1988. {{ISBN|0-9645960-0-8}}, pp. 95–106.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Never leaving a bound person alone.
* Avoiding positions or restraints which may induce [[postural asphyxia]].
* Making sure that the subject changes positions at least once an hour (to avoid [[circulation (physiology)|circulation]] problems).
* Making sure that the subject can be released quickly in an emergency.
* Avoiding restraints which impair breathing. (Gags or hoods which block the mouth can become [[asphyxial]] hazards if the subject vomits or the nose becomes otherwise blocked.)
* Remaining sober; alcohol and drugs should be avoided.

[[File:BoundCon 2013 custom photoshoot 8 picture 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3| [[Suspension bondage]]: A woman being hung upside down using adequate precautions at [[Bound Con]] event, Germany, 2013.]]

Accidents and lasting damage can generally be avoided by very simple security precautions and a rudimentary knowledge of the human anatomy. One very simple safety measure is to ask the subject every so often if he or she is all right. Another is to check body parts like hands and feet for numbness or coldness, which can happen if nerves have been pinched or blood circulation has been blocked. Another is to check for skin discoloration. Skin that does not get enough oxygen turns bluish. If blood can get in, but cannot get out because one of the veins has been blocked, that part of the body turns purple.

If the subject has been gagged or can otherwise not verbally communicate, a different form of the [[safeword]] is needed. For instance, they may hum a simple tune, or opening and closing one or both hands repeatedly, or releasing an object held in one hand (such as a rubber ball, or a scarf).

[[Suspension bondage]] by hanging upside-down can be especially risky. The danger most often associated with it is falling on your head.  Other dangers include [[nerve]] compression, circulation problems and fainting due to increase in blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Federation Francaise de Speleologie | title = Harness Induced Pathology | work = Petzl Work/Rescue Catalog | year = 1997 | url = http://www.caves.org/grotto/nag/html/harness.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051216185233/http://www.caves.org/grotto/nag/html/harness.html | archivedate = 16 December 2005 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Paul Seldon | title = Harness suspension: review and evaluation of existing information | publisher=UK Health and Safety Executive | work=Contract Research Report 451 | year = 2002 | url = http://www.hse.gov.uk/RESEARCH/crr_pdf/2002/crr02451.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparations===

Some simple preparations may also be helpful:
* Food. It is common &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openmindedhealth.com/2011/06/rope-bondage|title=Rope Bondage|author=|date=25 June 2011|website=Open Minded Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; for people (especially those on diets) to [[fainting|faint]] during a long session. Having a regular meal beforehand is recommended; being fed small snacks during play may also help prevent fainting.
* Cutting tools. A pair of [[EMT scissors]] is recommended (useful for safely cutting rope and tape off skin).
* Keyed-alike padlocks, if chains are being used.

Scenes depicted in bondage photographs and videos are chosen for their visual appeal and fantasy value. Sometimes these positions are dangerous or cannot be maintained for more than a few minutes (i.e., "don't try this at home") such as inverted bondage or suspension from the wrists and ankles. In many cases they cannot be "acted out" with good results and are only for extremely physically fit and very experienced BDSM participants. Especially in highly artistic Japanese bondage, years of experience of bondage is required to avoid the risks.

[[Self-bondage]] carries a higher risk, particularly because it violates an important principle of bondage safety; to never leave a bound person alone. For the feeling of being tied up to be as authentic as possible, practitioners of self-bondage can use time-limit clocks, freeze their keys in blocks of ice, or use self-invented devices, in order to temporarily abandon power over their own restraint and freedom (called "tunnel play").

Without someone to release them in the event of an emergency or medical crisis, self-bondage can lead to severe and permanent physical damage. Especially in combination with [[asphyxiation]], self-bondage can be lethal to its practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corpus-delicti.com/auto.html|title=Corpus-delicti.com|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
[[File:Slave at St. Andrews cross (3092).jpg|thumb|upright|A woman chained to a [[Saint Andrew's Cross (BDSM)|Saint Andrew's Cross]].]]
[[File:Exxxotica NJ 2013-066.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Two women mummified using duct tape, restraining their entire body, at [[Exxxotica]] 2013.]]

Bondage techniques can be divided into six main categories:
* Binding body parts, such as arms or legs, together.
* Spreading out body parts, such as arms or legs.
* Binding the restrained partner to an outside object, such as a [[Saint Andrew's Cross (BDSM)|Saint Andrew's Cross]], a chair, or a table.
* Suspending the restrained partner from the ceiling.
* Hindering or slowing down the movement of the restrained partner, such as with a [[hobble skirt]] or a [[corset]].
* Wrapping the restrained partner up in soft, elastic material, thus restraining their entire body. This is known as mummification.

Many people feel that bondage must be "rough and tough", as seen in many images of bondage erotica, but this is not always true. In so-called "soft bondage", the active partner can simply hold the restrained partner's hands together with their own hands, handcuff the restrained partner, or simply order the restrained partner not to move their hands, without using any physical restraint. This latter case, called "verbal bondage", appeals to many people and is far more common than most people {{who|date=July 2015}} think.

A popular variant of bondage considers the artistic and aesthetic part of tying a person up more than the transfer of power and control, or the sexual pleasure. This type of bondage is called "shibari" or "kinbaku", and comes originally from [[Japanese bondage]]. Shibari / kinbaku can be practised either in the traditional Japanese way or in conjunction with western bondage.

=== Techniques of rope bondage ===
[[Rope bondage]] is perhaps the best known and most used form of bondage. There are several forms of rope bondage.
; Rope wrapping: The rope is simply wrapped around the restrained partner's upper body, or in some cases, his/her entire body.
; Rope weaving: A more complicated technique, where a rope is first wrapped around the restrained partner's body in a zig-zag pattern, and then a second rope is woven around it.
; Double rope technique: The restrained partner is bound by two ropes at once, allowing decorative rope patterns to be applied quickly.
; Single rope technique: A sure technique, most often used in conjunction with sadomasochism, where the restrained partner is bound by only one rope.&lt;ref name="Papiertiger"/&gt;

=== Terms used in bondage ===
[[File:BoundCon 2013 bondage challenge 6.jpg|thumb|right|Two women in [[frogtie]] bondage.]]
In the American-European bondage scene, specific terms have developed for different kinds of bondage. The terms most often used in the European bondage subculture are in English, although some bondage term come from the Japanese language, such as ''kata'' (bondage position) or ''musubime'' (bondage knot). Examples of simple bondage techniques are the "spread eagle", where the restrained partner's each limb is tied to a different corner of a bed,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jay Wiseman|Wiseman, Jay]]: ''Jay Wiseman's Erotic Bondage Handbook''. Greenery Press, {{ISBN|1-890159-13-1}}, pp. 193–203.&lt;/ref&gt; or the "[[hogtie bondage|hogtie]]", where the restrained partner's hands and feet are both tied, and the ropes tying these are connected with each other, holding the restrained partner in a bent position. A "crotch rope" is sometimes used, where a rope is passed between the partner's legs, applying pressure to the genitals.

== Materials ==
Just about any material that can be used to hinder or restrain a person's movement can be used in bondage. Bondage can be performed with everyday objects or specially designed BDSM equipment.

In less BDSM-oriented vanilla bondage everyday objects, such as silk scarves, stockings, neckties and belts are often used. Soft objects such as these can also be used for binding in front of the restrained partner's eyes, temporarily blinding them.

"Verbal bondage" is bondage without physical restraint, the subject is simply given orders not to move, or only move in a restrained fashion.

===Rope===
{{Main article|Rope bondage|Bondage rope harness}}

Rope is very often used in bondage as a material for physical restraint. In the western world, almost any kind of rope can be used for bondage, such as cotton, artificial fibers, or other materials. However, in Japanese bondage (shibari), only ropes made of [[hemp]] or [[jute]] are usually used. In Japanese bondage, the rope is usually well prepared before it can be used, so that it becomes soft and easily bendable. Between bondage sessions, the rope is cleaned by washing it.

Regardless of the type of rope used for bondage, temporary superficial damage to the skin can appear where the rope has applied pressure, this is called "rope burns".&lt;ref&gt;Mass Sadist: ''B.D.S.M. 4 Dummies''. Lulu.com, 2006. {{ISBN|1-4303-0975-X}}, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In emergency situations, [[EMT scissors]] provide a quick way to free the restrained partner, however this destroys the rope.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jay Wiseman|Wiseman, Jay]]: ''The Toybag Guide to Dungeon Emergencies and Supplies''. Greenery Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-890159-54-9}}, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metal===
{{Main article|Metal bondage}}

Metal (especially steel) is often used in bondage, most often in [[handcuffs]], [[legcuffs]], [[thumbcuffs]], hooks and chains, and is often combined with other materials. Apart from the durability of metal and the flexibility of metal items, metal appeals to many people because of its tough image and the sheer toughness of being bound by metal items. Metal is practically immune to struggling and escape. In BDSM erotica, metal chains are often associated with historical torture and prison scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;Stargraves: ''The Shuttered House''. Last Gasp, 2003. {{ISBN|1-900058-37-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aldiss, Allan: ''Slaveship''. Bondage Books, 2006. {{ISBN|0-9549966-4-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from pure metal chains, [[cable tie]]s are also often used as a quick way to tie someone up securely. These ties can leave burn marks on the skin when applied too tightly, and because of their durability and resistance to struggling, must be handled carefully when applied to joints or being left in place for a longer time.

===Leather, latex and polish===
{{See also|Bondage suit}}
[[File:2 Pup Pride Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|A neoprene dog hood used in the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]]&lt;ref name=SBS/&gt;]]
Products made of leather are often used in bondage because of their flexibility and resistance to tearing. Because leather is easy to acquire, care for and work upon, it is one of the most popular materials for home-made bondage items. Many people have a fetish for leather, [[latex]] and [[polishing|polish]] and use these materials in connection with bondage, for example for cuffs, belts or neck bands. There are special bondage skirts, trousers or sacks made of these materials, as well as clothing and equipment for BDSM role play that can be used in connection with bondage. For example, harnesses are used in [[pony play]], but would not be used without the corresponding role play.&lt;ref name=SBS&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/video/726963267928/pup-play-men-who-live-as-dogs  |title=Pup play men who live as dogs |date=18 July 2016|work=[[Special Broadcasting Service]]|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bondage erotica ==
[[File:Three women posing in grease and ropes.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|Erotic pose of three women in bondage gear.]]
Some people regard bondage to be [[eroticism|erotically]] [[sexual stimulation|stimulating]] or [[sexual arousal|sexually arousing]]. Bondage features in some [[sexual fantasy]] scenarios. Bondage themes are present in some erotica and pornography.

[[Bondage pornography]] for heterosexual men almost overwhelmingly depicts bound women, rather than bound men, despite the fact that one of the most common fantasies in both sexes is being bound.

Bondage fantasies often involve dressing in a role outfit. Typical outfits for the submissive person invoke common icons of passivity or sexual innocence (e.g. a [[shepherd]]ess, [[nun]] or schoolgirl outfit for women, or a leather slave harness and cuffs, thong, or ancient slave outfit for men). In a similar respect, the dominant person's attire often reflect images of power, control, and extreme discipline (a [[Nazi]] officer, military officer, police or [[prison warden]] uniform).

==Spiritual aspects==
Some people who have been put into long-term deep bondage (mummification) have reported having [[Out-of-body experience|out-of-the-body experiences]] and there are some who desire to be put in deep bondage for this reason.  A [[New Age]] form of bondage is being immersed a [[sensory deprivation tank]] for the express purpose of having an out-of-the-body experience as was practiced while on [[ketamine]] by [[John C. Lilly]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John C. Lilly|Lilly, John C.]] ''The Center of the Cyclone'' 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art and popular culture==
[[File:Blacklight Shibari.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Bondage with fluorescent ropes.]]

Bondage is also presented in erotic and mainstream literary forms, including cartoons and magazines, and depicted in erotic art, such as some of the works of [[Gustave Doré]] and [[John Everett Millais]]. The mythical [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] was a popular subject for bondage in art by painters including [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[Andromeda Chained to the Rocks]]'' (1630), [[Théodore Chassériau]] (1840), [[Edward Poynter]] (1869) and [[Gustave Doré]] (1869).

Other popular scenarios for bondage in art was that of [[Angelica (character)|Angelica]] from the fifteenth century epic poem ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'', which is itself a continuation of the romantic epic saga ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', which is similar to that of Andromeda in that the heroine is offered as a sacrifice to the sea gods; and the [[damsel in distress]] theme. The damsel in distress theme was also used in ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' (1914) motion picture serial, which found [[Pearl White]] in mortal danger on a weekly basis.

Depictions of bondage in art may be erotic, in which case they follow a heteronormative model and tend to depict a young woman in danger and fear. ''Bizarre'' was a fetish and [[bondage magazine]] published between 1946–1959 by [[bondage artist]] [[John Willie]]. It included drawings and photographs using professional [[bondage model]]s in bondage or [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] scenes. [[Sweet Gwendoline]] was the main female character in his works, published largely in the 1950s and 60's, and possibly the most famous bondage icon after [[Bettie Page]]. She was repeatedly depicted as the stereotypical naïve blonde damsel in distress.

Bondage received a positive (if brief) treatment in ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'', a mainstream [[sex manual]] popular in the 1970s. The publication of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s book, ''[[Sex (book)|Sex]]'', which included photographs of bound nudes, did a great deal to improve public awareness of the acceptance of bondage.

By the 1990s, references to bondage could be found in [[Mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]] prime-time television series such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', where equipment such as [[handcuffs]] or [[collar (BDSM)|collar]]s and concepts such as the [[safeword]] were included as a matter of course.

''[[The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty]]'' was an erotic trilogy published in the 1980s by [[Anne Rice]] which contained bondage scenarios, as part of a wide range of BDSM acts.

Other examples of bondage erotica include [[Pauline Réage]]'s ''[[Story of O]]'', [[Frank E. Campbell (writer)|Frank E. Campbell]]'s books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backdrop.net/sm-201/index.php?title=F._E._Campbell|title=Backdrop.net|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the artwork of Robert Bishop.

The [[Fifty Shades trilogy|''Fifty Shades'' trilogy]] by E.L. James was first published in ebook in 2011 and subsequently went on to become a bestseller. The print edition of the first book, ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' was published in 2012 and became the fastest selling bestseller, breaking multiple sales records. The trilogy revolves entirely around a fictional BDSM relationship; though it is widely considered a poor representation of BDSM relationships by those in the BDSM scene, partially for its negative representation of women. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

'''Chinese musicology''' is the academic study of traditional [[Chinese music]].  This discipline has a very long history. The concept of music ''yue'' stands among the oldest categories of Chinese thought, however, in the known sources it does not receive a fairly  clear definition until the writing of the ''[[Classic of Music]]'' (lost during the Han dynasty).

==Music scales==
The first [[musical scale]]s were derived from the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. On the [[Guqin]] (a traditional instrument) all of the dotted positions are equal string length divisions related to the open string like 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/4, 3/4, etc. and are quite easy to recognize on this instrument. The Guqin has a scale of 13 positions all representing a natural harmonic position related to the open string.

The ancient Chinese defined, by mathematical means, a gamut or series of ''[[Shí-èr-lǜ]]'' (called the 十二律 12 ''lü'') from which various sets of five or seven frequencies were selected to make the sort of "do re mi" major [[scale (music)|scale]] familiar to those who have been formed with the [[Musical notation|Western Standard notation]]. The 12 ''lü'' approximate the frequencies known in the West as the chromatic scale, from A, then B-flat, through to G and A-flat.

==Scale and tonality==

Most Chinese music uses a [[pentatonic scale]], with the intervals (in terms of ''lǜ'') almost the same as those of the major pentatonic scale. The notes of this scale are called ''gōng'' 宫, ''shāng'' 商, ''jué'' 角, ''zhǐ'' 徵 and ''yǔ'' 羽. By starting from a different point of this sequence, a scale (named after its starting note) with a different interval sequence is  created, similar to the construction of [[Musical mode#Modern modes|modes]] in modern Western music.

Since the Chinese system is not an [[equal tempered]] tuning, playing a melody starting from the ''lǜ'' nearest to A will not necessarily sound the same as playing the same melody starting from some other ''lǜ'', since the [[wolf interval]] will occupy a different point in the scale. The effect of changing the starting point of a song can be rather like the effect of shifting from a [[major key|major]] to a [[minor key]] in Western music. The scalar tunings of [[Pythagoras]], based on 2:3 ratios (8:9, 16:27, 64:81, etc.), are a western near-parallel to the earlier calculations used to derive Chinese scales.

&lt;!--this image is not limited in width to 400px due to the amount of small detail--&gt;
[[File:Chinese_Music_Gamut_&amp;_Scales.svg|800px|left|thumb|How the scales are produced: Start with a fundamental frequency. (440 hertz is used here.) Apply the ratios to make the first column. Copy the second and all further elements in this column to the respective heads of the other eleven columns. Apply the ratios to make the second through the twelfth columns. So doing produces 144 frequencies (with some duplications). From each column five different selections of non-adjacent frequencies can be made. (See the colored blocks at the far left.) So each column can produce 60 different pentatonic scales.]]

'''Community informatics''' (CI) is an interdisciplinary field that is concerned with using [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technology (ICT)]] to empower members of communities and support their social, cultural, and economic development.&lt;ref name="source2"&gt;Gurstein, M. (2007). [http://eprints.rclis.org/10919/1/WHAT_IS_COMMUNITY_INFORMATICS_reading.pdf What is Community informatics? (And Why Does It Matter)], Polimetrica, Milan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt;
Community informatics may contribute to enhancing democracy, supporting the development of social capital, and building well connected communities; moreover, it is probable that such similar actions may let people experience new positive [[social change]].&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; In community informatics, there are several considerations which are the social context, shared values, distinct processes that are taken by members in a community, and [[Social system|social]] and technical systems.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; It is formally located as an academic discipline within a variety of academic faculties including [[information science]], [[information systems]], [[computer science]], [[planning]], [[development studies]], and [[library science]] among others and draws on insights on community development from a range of backgrounds and disciplines. It is an interdisciplinary approach interested in using ICTs for different forms of community action, as distinct from pure academic study about ICT effects.&lt;ref name="source2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, L. and H. Linger (2009). "Community Informatics and Information Systems: how can they be better connected?" The Information Society 25(4): 1-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Most humans live in communities. In some urban areas, community and neighborhood are conflated but this may be a limited definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wellman|first1=Barry|last2=Leighton|first2=Barry|title=Networks, neighborhoods, and communities: Approaches to the study of the community question|journal=Urban Affairs Quarterly|date=March 1979|volume=14|issue=3|pages=363–390|doi=10.1177/107808747901400305}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Communities are defined as people coming together in pursuit of common aims or shared practices through any means, including physical, electronic, and  [[social network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strath|first=B.|year=2001|title=Community/society: History of the concept =International Encyclopaedia of the Social &amp; Behavioural Sciences|publisher=Elsevier Science Ltd|pages=2378–2383|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They proliferate even while the ability to define them is amorphous.

Cultures ensure their growth and survival by continuing the norms and mores that are the bases of their way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What keeps societies together – Richard Sennett and Richard David Precht discuss in Berlin|url = http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/berlin/article/what-keeps-societies-together-richard-sennett-and-richard-david-precht-discuss-in-berlin.html|website = Cafebabel|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities can use the infrastructure of ICTs as a method of continuing cultures within the context of the Internet and the World Wide Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cyberpower {{!}} Public Sphere Project|url = http://www.publicsphereproject.org/patterns/print-pattern.php?begin=25|website = www.publicsphereproject.org|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once a cultural identity is defined within the context of these technologies, it can be replicated and disseminated through various means, including the sharing of information through websites, applications, databases, and file sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Common Ground: Holding Community Together {{!}} Holly Lisle: Official Author Homepage|url = http://hollylisle.com/common-ground-holding-community-together/|website = hollylisle.com|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this manner, a group that defines its cultural identity within the construct of technology infrastructure is empowered to hold valuable exchanges within the spheres of economics, political power, high and popular culture, education, and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2427.00242/pdf|title = Constructing Premium Network Spaces:Reflections on Infrastructure Networks andContemporary Urban Development|last = Graham|first = Stephen|date = 2000|journal = International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|doi = 10.1111/1468-2427.00242|pmid = |access-date =|volume=24|pages=183–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the inception of the Internet and the World Wide Web, we have seen the exponential growth of enterprises&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = HOW THE INTERNET CHANGED THE WORLD - Business Growth Fund|url = http://www.businessgrowthfund.co.uk/how-the-internet-changed-the-world/|website = Business Growth Fund|accessdate = 2015-11-12|language = en-US|first = Jon|last = Rhodes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from electronic commerce, social networking, entertainment and education, as well as a myriad of other contrivances and file exchanges that allow for an ongoing cultural enrichment through technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.arifyildirim.com/ilt508/sinikka.sassi.pdf|title = Cultural differentiation or social segregation?

To date there has been very considerable investment in supporting the electronic development of business communities, one-to-many  social tools (for example, corporate intranets, or purpose-built exchange  and [[social networking service]]s such as eBay, or Myspace),  or in developing applications for individual use. There is far less understanding, or investment in human-technical networks and processes  that are intended to deliberately result in social change or community change, particularly in communities for whom electronic communication is secondary to having an adequate income or social survival.

The communal dimension (and focus of Community Informatics) results in a strong interest in studying and developing strategies for how ICTs can enable and empower those living in physical communities. This is particularly the case in those communities where ICT access is done communally, through [[Telecentres]], information kiosks, community multimedia centres, and other technologies. This latter set of approaches has become of very considerable interest as Information and Communications Technology for Development ([[ICT4D]]) has emerged as significant element in strategic (and funding) approaches to social and economic development in [[Less developed country|Less Developed Countries]]. ICT4D initiatives have been undertaken by public, NGO and private sector agencies concerned with development such as the [[United Nations Development Program]], the [[World Bank]], the [[Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation]] (SDC), the [[MS Swaminathan Research Foundation]]; have emerged as a key element in the poverty alleviation component of the UN's [[Millennium Development Goals]]; and as important directions for private sector investment both from a market perspective (cf. the "[[Bottom of the Pyramid]]") and from companies concerned with finding a delivery channel for goods and services into rural and low income communities.

There is thus growing interest in Community Informatics as an approach to understanding of how different ICTs can enable and empower marginalized communities to achieve their collective goals.

==Understanding communities==
It is crucial to know how communities are formed and evolved and how the participation to a community occurs and differs while formation process.&lt;ref name="source1" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Azzopardi|first1=Andrew|last2=Grech|first2=Shaun|title=Inclusive communities a critical reader|date=2012|publisher=SensePublishers|location=Rotterdam|isbn=978-94-6091-849-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the nature of communities and the participation process will surely ensure designing and implemenameting a successful ICT solution that benefits members of community while communicating with each other or performing certain tasks.&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt; The following points include a brief description of the nature of each potential community formation.

===Community as a place===
A group of people may form a community according to the place in which they live, enjoy staying, and work.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; They usually participate in communities within these three places since they gather together on consistent basis so that it is highly expected that such community is formed.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; Beside the home and the work gathering, people usually like to spend their time at informal places called third places in where they meet their new or old friends or have a chance to meet new people.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt;

===Community as a socio-spatial entity===
A group of people may form a community as they have frequent direct interactions or live in close proximity to each other.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; The members of such community may have strong bond and focused common goals which give them a higher status over other communities.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; Moreover, as the number of the members increases, the community may become reputable and has a higher status over other communities.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt;

===Community as links between people===
A group of people may form a community as they have common shared identity.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; People may form such community to support and advocate common shared values, morals or norms in which they believe.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; Such a community may have a set of symbols and be associated with a status over other communities.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; The inclusion and the exclusion to such community depend on whether or not a member share the same identity with others in the community.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; For instance, people who descend from one origin may form a community in which only people from that origin can join the community even though they do not know each other in advance.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt;

===Community of interests===
A group of people may form a community as they have similar affinity for a particular activity, experience, or subject.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; The geographical location is not necessary while forming such community, and the inclusion and the exclusion to such community depends on whether a new member has that affinity or not.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt;

===Communities linked to life stage===
A group of people may form a community if they share a similar experience in a distinct life stage.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; The experience could be related to the members themselves or to their relatives, such as their children.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; For instance, parents of elementary school children may form a community in which they care about their children while in school.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; As it is mentioned in the previous type of community formation, the members of such community have a common interest which is caring about their children while in school.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; This type of community may persist over time, but the inclusion and the exclusion to it may happen consistently as people are no longer in that distinct life stage.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt;

===Communities of practice===
A group of people who share a similar profession may form a community in which they work to attain their goals and advance in their profession.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; Three important concepts are considered while forming community of practice which are mutual engagement, joint enterprise, and shared repertoire.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; In a community of practice, the members have to be mutually engaged with each other by establishing collaborative relationships that will allow them to willingly work on certain joint activities.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; In the second concept which is joint enterprise, the members of a community of practice are supposed to discuss and agree upon the work responsibilities so that they can work in harmony, and each member knows his responsibility and his expected contributions to the community.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; In addition to these two concepts, the members of the community of practice have a shared repertoire of procedures or ways to perform certain tasks.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; They usually agree upon these procedures and practices that they establish and develop over time.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt;

== Conceptual approaches ==
As an academic discipline, CI can be seen as a field of practice in applied information and communications technology. Community informatics is a technique for looking at economic and social development within the construct of technology&amp;mdash;online health communities, social networking websites, cultural awareness and enhancement through online connections and networks, electronic commerce, information exchanges, as well as a myriad of other aspects that contributes to creating a personal and group identity.  The term was brought to prominence by [[Michael Gurstein]].  Michael Gurstein says that community informatics is a technology strategy or discipline that connects at the community level economic and social development with the emergence of community and civic networks, electronic commerce, online participation, self-help, virtual health communities, "Tele-centres", as well as other types of online institutions and corporations.  He brought out the first representative collection of academic papers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurstein|first=Michael|year=2000|title=Community informatics: enabling communities with information and communications technologies|publisher=Hershey, PA, Idea Group Pub}}&lt;/ref&gt; although others, such as Brian Loader and his colleagues at the University of Teesside used the term in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Loader, B. and L. Keeble (2002). Community informatics : shaping computer-mediated social relations. New York, Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt;

CI brings together the practices of community development and organization, and insights from fields such as sociology, planning, computer science, [[critical theory]],  women's studies, library and information sciences, management information systems, and management studies. Its outcomes&amp;mdash;[[community network]]s and community-based ICT-enabled service applications&amp;mdash;are of increasing interest to grassroots organizations, NGOs and civil society, governments, the private sector, and multilateral agencies among others. Self-organized community initiatives of all varieties, from different countries, are concerned with ways to harness ICT for [[social capital]], poverty alleviation and for the empowerment of the "local" in relation to its larger economic, political and social environments. Some claim it is potentially a form of 'radical practice'.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Garth, Community Networking as Radical Practice The Journal of Community Informatics, Vol 1, No 3 (2005).
&lt;/ref&gt;

Community informatics may in fact, not gel as a single field within the academy, but remain a convenient locale for interdisciplinary activity, drawing upon many fields of social practice and endeavour, as well as knowledge of community applications of technology. However, one can begin to see the emergence of a postmodern "trans-discipline" presenting a challenge to existing disciplinary "stove-pipes" from the perspectives of the rapidly evolving fields of technology practice, technology change, public policy and commercial interest. Whether or not such a "trans-discipline" can maintain its momentum remains to be seen given the incertitude about the boundaries of such disciplines as community development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hustedde | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Ganowicz | first2 = J. | year = 2002 | title = The basics: What's essential about theory for community development practice? | url = | journal = Journal of the Community Development Society | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1080/15575330209490139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, there is a continuing disconnect between those coming from an Information Science perspective for whom social theories, including general theories of organisation are unfamiliar or seemingly irrelevant to solving complex 'technical' problems,&lt;ref name="Orlikowski"&gt;Orlikowski, W. J. and S. R. Barley (2001). "Technology and institutions: What can research on information technology and research on organizations learn from each other?" MIS Quarterly; management information systems 25(Jun): 145-165.&lt;/ref&gt; and those whose focus is upon the theoretical and practical issues around working with communities for democratic and social change&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stoecker | first1 = R | year = 2005 | title = Is Community Informatics good for communities? Questions confronting an emerging field | url = | journal = The Journal of Community Informatics | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 13–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Neil | first1 = D | year = 2002 | title = Assessing community informatics: A review of methodological approaches for evaluating community networks and community technology centers | url = | journal = Internet Research | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 76–103 | doi=10.1108/10662240210415844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that many of those most actively involved in early efforts were academics, it is only inevitable that a process of "sense-making" with respect to these efforts would follow from "tool-making" efforts. These academics, and some community activists connected globally through the medium.{{Clarify|date=June 2014|reason=Through which medium?}}

A first formal meeting of researchers with an academic interest in these initiatives was held in conjunction with the 1999 Global Community Networking Conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This meeting began the process of linking community-based ICT initiatives in [[Developed country|developed countries]] with initiatives undertaken in [[Developing country|developing countries]], which were often part of larger economic and social development programmes funded by agencies such as the [[UN Development Programme]], [[World Bank]], or the [[International Development Research Centre]]. Academics and researchers interested in ICT efforts in developed countries began to see common and overlapping interests with those interested in similar work in less developed countries.  For example, the issue of sustainability as a technical, cultural, and economic problem for community informatics has resulted in a special issue of the Journal of Community Informatics &lt;ref&gt;Journal of Community Informatics Vol 1, No 2 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the subject of ongoing conferences in Prato, Italy and other conferences in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciresearch.net|accessdate=2006-11-23|title=Community Informatics Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the beginnings of CI can be recognized from various trials in community networking in the 1970s (Clement 1981). An essential development occurred in the 1990s, due to the change of cost of computers and modems. Moreover, examples of using computer networking to initiate and enhance social activities was acknowledged by women's groups (Balka 1992) and by the labor movement (Mazepa 1997).&lt;ref name="source35" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Clement|first1=Andrew|last2=Gurstein|first2=Michael|last3=Longford|first3=Graham|last4=Moll|first4=Marita|last5=Shade|first5=Leslie Regan|title=Connecting Canadians investigations in community informatics|date=2012|publisher=AU Press|location=Edmonton|isbn=978-1-926836-42-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social informatics refers to the body of research and study that examines social aspects of computerization&amp;mdash;including the roles of information technology in social and organizational change, the uses of information technologies in social contexts, and the ways that the social organization of information technologies is influenced by social forces and social practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rkcsi.indiana.edu/ |title=Rob Kling Center for Social Informatics |publisher=Rkcsi.indiana.edu |accessdate=2012-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, social informatics research has been strong in the Scandinavian countries, the UK and Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sawyer|first1=Steve|last2=Rosenbaum|first2=Howard|title=Social Informatics in the Information Sciences: Current Activities and Emerging Directions|journal=Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline|date=2000|volume=3|pages=89–96|url=http://www.inform.nu/Articles/Vol3/v3n2p89-96r.pdf|accessdate=9 June 2014|issn=1521-4672}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe some researchers have pointed out that in order to create awareness of the importance of social issues of computing, one has to focus on [[didactics]] of social informatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godejord|first1=Per A|title=Fighting child pornography: Exploring didactics and student engagement in social informatics|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|volume=58|issue=3|pages=446–451|doi=10.1002/asi.20522}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within North America, the field is represented largely through independent research efforts at a number of diverse institutions. Social informatics research diverges from earlier, deterministic (both social and technological) models for measuring the social impacts of technology. Such technological deterministic models characterized information technologies as tools to be installed and used with a pre-determined set of impacts on society dictated by the technology's stated capabilities.  Similarly, the socially deterministic theory represented by some proponents of the [[social construction of technology|social construction of technology (SCOT)]] or [[social shaping of technology]] theory see technology as the product of human social forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Robin|last2=Edge|first2=David|title=The social shaping of technology|journal=Research Policy|volume=25|issue=6|pages=865–899|doi=10.1016/0048-7333(96)00885-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
There is a tension between the practice and research ends of the field. To some extent this reflects the gap, familiar from other disciplines such as [[community development]], [[community organizing]] and community based research.&lt;ref&gt;Stoecker, R. (2005). Research methods for community change : a project-based approach. Thousand Oaks, Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the difficulty that Information Systems has in recognising the qualitative dimension of technology research means that the kind of approach taken by supporters of community informatics is difficult to justify to a positive field oriented towards solutions of technical, rather than social problems. This is a difficulty also seen in the relationship between strict technology research and management research.&lt;ref name="Orlikowski"/&gt;  Problems in conceptualising and evaluating complex social interventions relying on a technical base are familiar from [[community health]] and [[community education]]. There are long-standing debates about the desire for accountable - especially ''quantifiable'' and outcome-focused social development, typically practised by government or supported by foundations, and the more participatory, qualitatively rich, process-driven priorities of grass-roots community activists, familiar from theorists such as [[Paulo Freire]], or [[John Dewey#Deweyan pragmatism|Deweyan pragmatism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Some of the theoretical and practical tensions are also familiar from such disciplines as [[program evaluation]] and social policy, and perhaps paradoxically, Management Information Systems, where there is continual debate over the relative virtue and values of different forms of research and action, spread around different understandings of the virtues or otherwise of allegedly "scientific" or "value-free" activity (frequently associated with "responsible"  and deterministic public policy philosophies), and contrasted with more interpretive and process driven viewpoints in bottom-up or practice driven activity.  Community informatics would in fact probably benefit from closer knowledge of, and relationship to, theorists, practitioners, and evaluators of rigorous [[qualitative research]] and practice.

A further concern is the potential for practice to be "hijacked" by policy or academic agendas, rather than being driven by community goals, both in developed and developing countries. The ethics of technology intervention in indigenous or other communities has not been sufficiently explored, even though ICTs are increasingly looked upon as an important tool for social and economic development in such communities.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, L. and B. Craig (2006). Incorporating Indigenous World Views in Community Informatics. OTM Workshops 2006, LNCS 4277. Montpellier, France, Springer Berlin / Heidelberg: 237-246.
&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, neither explicit theoretical positions nor ideological positioning has yet emerged.  Many projects appear to have developed with no particular disciplinary affiliation, arising more directly from policy or practice imperatives to 'do something' with technology as funding opportunities arise or as those at the grassroots (or working with the grassroots) identify ICT as possible resources to respond to local issues, problems or opportunities. The papers and documented outcomes (as questions or issues for further research or elaboration) on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070105200350/http://ccnr.webstylus.net/wiki/ wiki of the October 2006 Prato conference] demonstrate that many of the social, rather than technical issues are key questions of concern to any practitioner in community settings: how to bring about change; the nature of authentic or manufactured community; ethical frameworks; or the politics of community research.

A different strain of critique has emerged from gender studies. Some theorists have argued that feminist contributions to the field have yet to be fully acknowledged and Community Informatics as a research area has yet to welcome feminist interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peddle|first=Katrina |author2=Powell, Alison |author3=Shade, Leslie Regan|title=Bringing feminist perspectives into community informatics|journal=Atlantis: A Women's Studies Journal|year=2008|volume=32|issue=2|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exists despite the presence of several gender-oriented studies and leadership roles played by women in community informatics initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peddle|first=Katrina |author2=Powell, Alison |author3=Shade, Leslie Regan|title=Bringing feminist perspectives into community informatics|journal=Atlantis: A Women's Studies Journal|year=2008|volume=32|issue=2|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and practice interests ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2014}}

{{One source section|date=September 2017}}

Research and practice ranges from concerns with purely virtual communities; to situations in which virtual or online communication are used to enhance existing communities in urban, rural, or remote geographic locations in developed or developing countries; to applications of ICTs for the range of areas of interest for communities including social and economic development, environmental management, media and "content" production, public management and e-governance among others.  A central concern, although one not always realized in practice is with "enabling" or "empowering" communities with ICT that is, ensuring that the technology is available for the community.  This further implies an approach to development which is rather more "bottom up" than "top down".

Areas of concern range from small-scale projects in particular communities or organizations which might involve only a handful of people, such as [[telecentres]]; an on online community of disabled people;  civic networks and  to large national, government sponsored networking projects in countries such as Australia and Canada or local community projects such as working with Maori families in New Zealand.  The [[Gates Foundation]] has been active in supporting public libraries in countries such as Chile.  An area of rapidly developing interest is in the use of ICT as a means to enhance citizen engagement as an "e-Governance" counterpart (or counterweight) to transaction oriented initiatives.

A key conceptual element and framing concept for Community Informatics is that of "effective use" introduced initially by [[Michael Gurstein]] in a critique of a research pre-occupation with the Digital Divide as ICT "access".&lt;ref&gt;Gurstein, M. B. (2000). "Effective use: A community informatics strategy beyond the Digital Divide" First Monday, volume 8, number 12 (December 2003) URL: http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue8_12/gurstein/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  CI is concerned with how ICTs are used in practice and not simply facilitating "access" to them and the notion of "effective use" is a bridge between CI research (research and analysis of the constituent elements of effective use), CI policy (developing enabling structures and programmes supportive of "effective use") and practice (implementing applications and services in support of local communities).

Another way to understand CI is Clement and Shade's "access rainbow" (Clement and Shade 2000).&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt; Clement and Shade have contended that accomplishing insignificant specialized connectedness to the Internet is no assurance that an individual or group will prevail with regards to appropriating new ICTs in ways that advance their improvement, independence, or empowerment. It is an approach which has multi-layered socio-specialized model for universal access to ICTs. It is displayed as seven layers, starting with the fundamental technical components of connectedness and moving upward through layers that inexorably push the essential social framework of access. The seven layers are: 1. Carriage 2. Devices 3. Software tools Internet 4. Content/services 5. Service/access 6. Literacy / social facilitation 7. Governance.&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt; Even though that all elements are important, the most important one is the content /service layer in the middle, since this is where the actual utility is most direct. The upper layers focus on social dimensions and the lower layers focus on technical aspects.&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt;

Many practitioners would dispute any necessary connection to university research, regarding academic theorising and interventions as constraining or irrelevant to grassroots activity which should be beyond the control of traditional institutions, or simply irrelevant to practical local goals.

Some of the commonalities and differences may be in fact be due to national and cultural differences. For example, the capacity of many North American (and particularly US) universities to engage in [[service learning]] as part of progressive charters in communities large and small is part of a long-standing tradition absent elsewhere.  The tradition of service learning is almost entirely absent in the UK, Australia, or New Zealand, (and of limited significance in Canada) where the State has traditionally played a much stronger role in the delivery of community services and information.

In some countries such as the UK, there is a tradition of locally based grassroots community technology, for example in Manchester, or in [[Hebden Bridge]]. In Italy and the Netherlands, there also appears to have been a strong connection between the development of local civic networks based around a tradition of civic oppositionism, connected into the work of progressive academics.

In Latin America, Africa and many parts of Asia these efforts have been driven by external funding agencies as part of larger programs and initiatives in support of broader economic and social development goals. However, these efforts have now become significantly "indigenized" (and particularly in Latin America) and "bottom-up" ICT efforts are increasingly playing a leading role in defining the future use of ICT within local communities.

In Canada, The Canadian Research Alliance for Community Innovation and Networking (CRACIN) was established in 2003. Their goal is to explore and archive the status and achievements of CI activities in Canada. It is a research partnership between scholastics, specialists, and public sector delegates.&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt;

== Networks ==
There are emerging online and personal networks of researchers and practitioners in community informatics and community networking in many countries as well as international groupings.  The past decade has also seen conferences in many countries, and there is an emerging literature for theoreticians and practitioners including the on-line Journal of Community Informatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci-journal.net |title=Journal of Community Informatics |accessdate=30 August 2010 |publisher=Centre for Community Informatics, Research, Development and Training (CCIRDT) &amp; Faculty of Informatics and Design, Cape Peninsula University of Technology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is surprising in fact, how much in common is found when people from developed and non-developed countries meet. A common theme is the struggle to convince policy makers of the legitimacy of this approach to developing electronically literate societies, instead of a top-down or trickle-down approach, or an approach dominated by technical, rather than social solutions which in the end, tend to help vendors rather than communities. A common criticism that is frequently raised amongst participants at events such as the Prato conferences is that a focus on technical solutions evades the social changes that communities need to achieve in their values, activities and other people-oriented outcomes in order to make better use of technology.

The field tends to have a progressive bent, being concerned about the use of technology for social and cultural development connected to a desire for [[capacity building]] or expanding [[social capital]], and in a number of countries, governments and foundations have funded a variety of community informatics projects and initiatives, particularly from a more tightly controlled, though not well-articulated social planning perspective, though knowledge about long-term effects of such forms of social intervention on use of technology is still in its early stages.

=== Public libraries and community networks===
Even though that community networks and public libraries have similitudes in various ways, there are some obstacles that upset the probability of cooperation in the future between them. Albeit both CNs and libraries are concerned with giving information services to the society, an exchange is by all accounts lacking between the two communities. The mission of libraries is frequently rather barely engaged and, with regards to managing people and different institutes, their methodology can be to some degree unbending. Thusly, CN specialists, while institutionally more adaptable, rush to expel the part of public libraries in the community, tending to see the library essentially as a store of books upheld by public subsidizing. Public libraries have a long-standing custom of association with their communities, yet their conditions and concerns contrast from those of community networks (CNs).&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt;

'''Concept testing''' (to be distinguished from '''pre-test markets''' and '''test markets''' which may be used at a later stage of product development research)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wind|first1=Yoram|title=NEW-PRODUCT FORECASTING MODELS AND APPLICATIONS|date=1984|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-669-04102-6|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the process of using surveys (and sometimes [[qualitative marketing research|qualitative methods]]) to evaluate consumer acceptance of a new product idea prior to the introduction of a product to the [[Market (economics)|market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=David|title=Concept Testing: How to Test New Product Ideas Before You Go to Market|date=1987|publisher=American Management Association|isbn=978-0814459058|edition=1st|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is '''important not to confuse''' concept testing with advertising testing, brand testing and packaging testing; as is sometimes done. Concept testing focuses on the basic product idea, without the embellishments and puffery inherent in advertising.

It is important that the instruments (questionnaires) to test the product have a high quality themselves. Otherwise, results from data gathered surveys may be biased by measurement error. That makes the design of the testing procedure more complex. Empirical tests provide insight into the quality of the questionnaire. This can be done by:
* conducting [[cognitive pretesting|cognitive interviewing]]. By asking a faction of potential-respondents about their interpretation of the questions and use of the questionnaire, a researcher can verify the viability of the cognitive interviewing.
* carrying out a small pretest of the questionnaire, using a small subset of target respondents. Results can inform a researcher of errors such as missing questions, or logical and procedural errors.
* estimating the measurement quality of the questions. This can be done for instance using test-retest,&lt;ref&gt;Lord, F. and Novick, M. R.(1968). Statistical theories of mental test scores. Addison – Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; quasi-simplex,&lt;ref&gt;Heise, D. R.(1969). Separating reliability and stability in test-retest correlation. American Sociological Review, 34, 93-101.&lt;/ref&gt; or mutlitrait-multimethod models.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, F. M. (1984). Construct validity and error components of survey measures: a structural modelling approach. Public Opinion Quarterly, 48, 409-442.&lt;/ref&gt;
* predicting the measurement quality of the question. This can be done using the software Survey Quality Predictor (SQP).&lt;ref&gt;Saris, W. E. and Gallhofer, I. N. (2014). Design, evaluation and analysis of questionnaires for survey research. Second Edition. Hoboken, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept testing in the new product development (NPD) process is the concept generation stage. The concept generation stage of concept testing can take on many forms. Sometimes concepts are generated incidentally, as the result of technological advances. At other times concept generation is deliberate: examples include brain-storming sessions, problem detection surveys and qualitative research. While qualitative research can provide insights into the range of reactions consumers may have, it cannot provide an indication of the likely success of the new concept; this is better left to quantitative concept-test surveys.

In the early stages of concept testing, a large field of alternative concepts might exist, requiring concept-screening surveys. Concept-screening surveys provide a quick means to narrow the field of options; however they provide little depth of insight and cannot be compared to a normative database due to interactions between concepts. For greater insight and to reach decisions on whether or not pursue further product development, monadic concept-testing surveys must be conducted.

Frequently concept testing surveys are described as either monadic, sequential monadic or comparative. The terms mainly refer to how the concepts are displayed:

1.) Monadic. The concept is evaluated in isolation.
2.) Sequential monadic. Multiple concepts are evaluated in sequence (often randomized order).
3.) Comparative. Concepts are shown next to each other. 
4.) Proto-monadic. Concepts are first shown in sequence, and then next to each other.

"Monadic testing is the recommended method for most concept testing. Interaction effects and biases are avoided. Results from one test can be compared to results from previous monadic tests. A normative database can be constructed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Jerry|title=Concept Testing (And The "Uniqueness" Paradox)|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/whitepapers/concepttesting/|website=Decision Analyst|publisher=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=2|date=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, each has its specific uses and it depends on the research objectives. The decision as to which method to use is best left to experience research professionals to decide, as there are numerous implications in terms of how the results are interpreted.

==Evaluating concept-test scores==

Traditionally concept-test survey results are compared to 'norms databases'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Jerry|title=Concept Testing (And The "Uniqueness" Paradox)|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/whitepapers/concepttesting/|website=Decision Analyst|publisher=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=2|date=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are databases of previous new-product concept tests. These must be 'monadic' concept tests, to prevent interaction effects. To be fair, it is important that these databases contain 'new' concept test results, not ratings of old products that consumers are already familiar with; since once consumers become familiar with a product the ratings often drop. Comparing new concept ratings to the ratings for an existing product already on the market would result in an invalid comparison, unless special precautions are taken by researchers to reduce or adjust for this effect quantitatively. Additionally, the concept is usually only compared to norms from the same product category, and the same country.

Companies that specialize in this area, tend to have developed their own unique systems, each with its own standards. Keeping to these standards consistently is important to preventing contamination of the results.

Perhaps one of the famous concept-test systems is the Nielsen Bases system, which comes in different versions. Other well-known products include Decision Analyst's 'Concept Check', Acupoll's 'Concept Optimizer', Ipsos Innoquest and GFK. Examples of smaller players include Skuuber and Acentric Express Test.

==Determining the importance of concept attributes as purchase drivers==

The simplest approach to determining attribute importance is to ask direct open-ended questions. Alternatively checklists or ratings of the importance of each product attribute may be used.

However, various debates have existed over whether or not consumers could be trusted to directly indicate the level of importance of each product attribute. As a result, correlation analysis and various forms of multiple regression have often been used for identifying importance - as an alternative to direct questions.

A complementary technique to concept testing, is conjoint analysis (also referred to as discrete choice modelling). Various forms of conjoint analysis and discrete choice modelling exist. While academics stress the differences between the two, in practice there is often little difference. 
These techniques estimate the importance of product attributes indirectly, by creating alternative products according to an experimental design, and then using consumer responses to these alternatives (usually ratings of purchase likelihood or choices made between alternatives) to estimate importance. The results are often expressed in the form of a 'simulator' tool which allows clients to test alternative product configurations and pricing.

'''Volumetric concept testing'''

Volumetric concept testing falls somewhere between traditional concept testing and pre-test market models (simulated test market models are similar but emphasize greater realism) in terms of the level of complexity. The aim is to provide 'approximate' sales volume forecasts for the new concept prior to launch. They incorporate other variables beyond just input from the concept test survey itself, such as the distribution strategy.

Examples of volumetric forecasting methodologies include 'Acupoll Foresight'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ForeSIGHT™ Going-Year Volume Estimates|url=http://www.acupoll.com/volume-forecasts|website=Acupoll|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Decision Analyst's 'Conceptor'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptor® Volumetric Forecasting|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/analytics/volumetric/|website=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=3|date=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some models (more properly referred to as 'pre-test market models' or 'simulated test markets')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wind|first1=Yoram|title=NEW-PRODUCT FORECASTING MODELS AND APPLICATIONS|date=1984|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-669-04102-6|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; gather additional data from a follow-up product testing survey (especially in the case of consumer packaged goods as repeat purchase rates need to be estimated). They may also include advertisement testing component that aims to assess advertising quality. Some such as Decision Analyst, include discrete choice models / conjoint analysis.

In [[mathematics]], '''division by zero''' is [[division (mathematics)|division]] where the divisor (denominator) is [[0 (number)|zero]]. Such a division can be formally [[expression (mathematics)|expressed]] as ''a''/0 where ''a'' is the dividend (numerator). In ordinary arithmetic, the expression has no meaning, as there is no number which, multiplied by 0, gives ''a'' (assuming ''a''≠0), and so division by zero is [[undefined (mathematics)|undefined]]. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, the expression 0/0 is also undefined; when it is the form of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]], it is an [[indeterminate form]]. Historically, one of the earliest recorded references to the mathematical impossibility of assigning a value to ''a''/0 is contained in [[George Berkeley]]'s criticism of [[infinitesimal calculus]] in 1734 in ''[[The Analyst]]'' ("ghosts of departed quantities").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

There are mathematical structures in which ''a''/0 is defined for some ''a'' such as in the [[Riemann sphere]] and the [[projectively extended real line]]; however, such structures cannot satisfy every ordinary rule of arithmetic (the [[Field mathematics#Definition and illustration|field axioms]]).

In [[Computer|computing]], a [[computer programming|program error]] may result from an attempt to divide by zero. Depending on the programming environment and the type of number (e.g. [[floating point]], [[integer]]) being divided by zero, it may generate [[Extended real number line|positive or negative infinity]] by the [[IEEE 754]] floating point standard, generate an [[exception handling|exception]], generate an [[error message]], cause the program to terminate, result in a special [[NaN|not-a-number]] value, a [[Hang (computing)|freeze]] via infinite [[Loop (computing)|loop]], or a [[Crash (computing)|crash]].

==Elementary arithmetic==
When division is explained at the [[elementary arithmetic]] level, it is often considered as splitting a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of objects into equal parts. As an example, consider having ten cookies, and these cookies are to be distributed equally to five people at a table. Each person would receive &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{10}{5}&lt;/math&gt; = 2 cookies. Similarly, if there are ten cookies, and only one person at the table, that person would receive &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{10}{1}&lt;/math&gt; = 10 cookies.

So, for dividing by zero, what is the number of cookies that each person receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed amongst 0 people at a table? Certain words can be pinpointed in the question to highlight the problem. The problem with this question is the "when". There is no way to evenly distribute 10 cookies to nobody. In [[mathematical jargon]], a set of 10 items cannot be [[Partition of a set|partitioned]] into 0 subsets. So &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{10}{0}&lt;/math&gt;, at least in elementary arithmetic, is said to be either meaningless, or undefined.

Similar problems occur if one has 0 cookies and 0 people, but this time the problem is in the phrase "'''the''' number". A partition is possible (of a set with 0 elements into 0 parts), but since the partition has 0 parts, [[Vacuous truth|vacuously]] every set in our partition has a given number of elements, be it 0, 2, 5, or 1000.

If there are, say, 5 cookies and 2 people, the problem is in "evenly distribute". In any integer partition of a 5-set into 2 parts, one of the parts of the partition will have more elements than the other. But the problem with 5 cookies and 2 people can be solved by cutting one cookie in half. The problem with 5 cookies and 0 people cannot be solved in any way that preserves the meaning of "divides".

Another way of looking at division by zero is that division can always be checked using multiplication. Considering the 10/0 example above, setting x = 10/0, if ''x'' equals ten divided by zero, then ''x'' times zero equals ten, but there is no ''x'' that, when multiplied by zero, gives ten (or any other number than zero). If instead of x=10/0 we have x=0/0, then every ''x'' satisfies the question 'what number x, multiplied by zero, gives zero?'

==Early attempts==
The ''[[Brahmasphutasiddhanta]]'' of [[Brahmagupta]] (598–668) is the earliest known text to treat [[0 (number)|zero]] as a number in its own right and to define operations involving zero.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=Robert |title=The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |location=New York |pages=68–75 |isbn=0-19-514237-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author could not explain division by zero in his texts: his definition can be easily proven to lead to algebraic absurdities. According to Brahmagupta,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A positive or negative number when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator. Zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator. Zero divided by zero is zero.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 830, [[Mahavira (mathematician)|Mahavira]] tried unsuccessfully to correct Brahmagupta's mistake in his book in ''Ganita Sara Samgraha'': "A number remains unchanged when divided by zero."&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;

==Algebra==

The four basic operations − addition, subtraction, multiplication and division − as applied to whole numbers (positive integers), with some restrictions, in elementary arithmetic are used as a framework to support the extension of the realm of numbers to which they apply. For instance, to make it possible to subtract any whole number from another, the realm of numbers must be expanded to the entire set of [[integers]] in order to incorporate the negative integers. Similarly, to support division of any integer by any other, the realm of numbers must expand to the [[rational numbers]]. During this gradual expansion of the number system, care is taken to ensure that the "extended operations", when applied to the older numbers, do not produce different results. Loosely speaking, since division by zero has no meaning (is ''undefined'') in the whole number setting, this remains true as the setting expands to the [[real number|real]] or even [[complex numbers]].

As the realm of numbers to which these operations can be applied expands there are also changes in how the operations are viewed. For instance, in the realm of integers, subtraction is no longer considered a basic operation since it can be replaced by addition of signed numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klein|1925|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when the realm of numbers expands to include the rational numbers, division is replaced by multiplication by certain rational numbers. In keeping with this change of viewpoint, the question, "Why can't we divide by zero?", becomes "Why can't a rational number have a zero denominator?". Answering this revised question precisely requires close examination of the definition of rational numbers.

In the modern approach to constructing the field of real numbers, the rational numbers appear as an intermediate step in the development that is founded on set theory. First, the natural numbers (including zero) are established on an axiomatic basis such as [[Peano axioms|Peano's axiom system]] and then this is expanded to the [[ring of integers]]. The next step is to define the rational numbers keeping in mind that this must be done using only the sets and operations that have already been established, namely, addition, multiplication and the integers. Starting with the set of [[ordered pair]]s of integers, {{math|{(''a'', ''b'')}}} with {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}}, define a [[binary relation]] on this set by {{math|(''a'', ''b'') ≃ (''c'', ''d'')}} if and only if {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}. This relation is shown to be an [[equivalence relation]] and its [[equivalence class]]es are then defined to be the rational numbers. It is in the formal proof that this relation is an equivalence relation that the requirement that the second coordinate is not zero is needed (for verifying [[Transitive relation|transitivity]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schumacher|1996|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamilton|1982|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Henkin|Smith|Varineau|Walsh|2012|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above explanation may be too abstract and technical for many purposes, but if one assumes the existence and properties of the rational numbers, as is commonly done in elementary mathematics, the "reason" that division by zero is not allowed is hidden from view. Nevertheless, a (non-rigorous) justification can be given in this setting.

It follows from the properties of the number system we are using (that is, integers, rationals, reals, etc.), if {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}} then the equation&lt;ref&gt;if {{math|1=''b'' = 0}} this is not an equation since the left side is not a number and the right side is a number.&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|1={{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} = ''c''}} is equivalent to {{math|1= ''a'' = ''b'' × ''c''}}. Assuming that {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|0}}}} is a number {{mvar|c}}, then it must be that {{math|1=''a'' = 0 × ''c'' = 0}}. However, the single number {{mvar|c}} would then have to be determined by the equation {{math|1= 0 = 0 × ''c''}}, but every number satisfies this equation, so we cannot assign a numerical value to {{math|{{sfrac|0|0}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bunch|1997|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Division as the inverse of multiplication===
The concept that explains [[Division (mathematics)|division]] in algebra is that it is the inverse of multiplication. For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=E-Z Math |edition=revised |first1=Anthony |last1=Prindle |first2=Katie |last2=Prindle |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7641-4132-4 |page=35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zQIrGLwkQkC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3zQIrGLwkQkC&amp;pg=PA35 Extract of page 35]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{3}=2&lt;/math&gt;
since 2 is the value for which the unknown quantity in
:&lt;math&gt;?\times 3=6&lt;/math&gt;
is true. But the expression
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{0}=\,x&lt;/math&gt;
requires a value to be found for the unknown quantity in
:&lt;math&gt;x\times 0=6.&lt;/math&gt;
But any number multiplied by 0 is 0 and so there is no number that solves the equation.

The expression
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{0}{0}=\,x&lt;/math&gt;
requires a value to be found for the unknown quantity in
:&lt;math&gt;x\times 0=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Again, any number multiplied by 0 is 0 and so this time every number solves the equation instead of there being a single number that can be taken as the value of 0/0.

In general, a single value can't be assigned to a fraction where the denominator is 0 so the value remains undefined.

===Fallacies===
{{details|Mathematical fallacy}}
A compelling reason for not allowing division by zero is that, if it were allowed, many absurd results (i.e., [[fallacy|fallacies]]) would arise. When working with numerical quantities it is easy to determine when an illegal attempt to divide by zero is being made. For example, consider the following computation.

With the following assumptions:

:&lt;math&gt;0\times 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;0\times 2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The following must be true:

:&lt;math&gt;0\times 1 = 0\times 2.&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by zero gives:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{0}{0}\times 1 = \frac{0}{0}\times 2.&lt;/math&gt;

Simplified, this yields:

:&lt;math&gt;1 = 2.&lt;/math&gt;

The fallacy here is the assumption that dividing by 0 is a legitimate operation with the same properties as dividing by any other number.

However, it is possible to disguise a division by zero in an [[algebra]]ic argument,&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt; leading to [[invalid proof]]s that, for instance, {{math|1=1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2}} such as the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bunch|1997|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Let {{math|1= 1 = ''x''}}.
:Multiply by {{mvar|x}} to get
::&lt;math&gt;x = x^2.&lt;/math&gt; 
:Subtract {{math|1}} from each side to get
::&lt;math&gt;x - 1 = x^2 - 1.&lt;/math&gt;
:Divide both sides by {{math|''x'' - 1}}
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{x-1}{x-1} = \frac{x^2 -1}{x - 1}.&lt;/math&gt;
:Which simplifies to
::&lt;math&gt;1 = x + 1.&lt;/math&gt;
:But, since {{math|1=''x'' = 1}},
::  &lt;math&gt;1 = 1 + 1 = 2.&lt;/math&gt;
The disguised division by zero occurs since {{math|''x'' − 1}} is zero when {{math|1=''x'' = 1}}.

==Calculus==
===Extended real line===
{{see also|l'Hôpital's rule}}

At first glance it seems possible to define ''a''/0 by considering the [[limit of a function|limit]] of ''a''/''b'' as ''b'' approaches 0.

For any positive ''a'', the limit from the right is

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{b \to 0^+} {a \over b} = +\infty&lt;/math&gt;

however, the limit from the left is

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{b \to 0^-} {a \over b} = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;

and so the &lt;math&gt;\lim_{b \to 0} {a \over b}&lt;/math&gt; is undefined (the limit is also undefined for negative ''a'').

Furthermore, there is no obvious definition of 0/0 that can be derived from considering the limit of a ratio. The limit

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{(a,b) \to (0,0)} {a \over b} &lt;/math&gt;

does not exist. Limits of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 0} {f(x) \over g(x)} &lt;/math&gt;

in which both ''ƒ''(''x'') and ''g''(''x'') approach 0 as ''x'' approaches 0, may equal any real or infinite value, or may not exist at all, depending on the particular functions ''ƒ'' and ''g''. These and other similar facts show that the expression 0/0 cannot be [[well-defined]] as a limit.

====Formal operations====
A [[formal calculation]] is one carried out using rules of arithmetic, without consideration of whether the result of the calculation is well-defined. Thus, it is sometimes useful to think of ''a''/0, where ''a''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0, as being &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. This infinity can be either positive, negative, or unsigned, depending on context. For example, formally:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits_{x \to 0} {\frac{1}{x} =\frac{\lim\limits_{x \to 0} {1}}{\lim\limits_{x \to 0} {x}}} = \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

As with any formal calculation, invalid results may be obtained. A logically rigorous (as opposed to formal) computation would assert only that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = +\infty\text{ and }\lim\limits_{x \to 0^-} \frac{1}{x} = -\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the [[one-sided limit]]s are different, the two-sided limit does not exist in the standard framework of the real numbers. Also, the fraction 1/0 is left [[Defined and undefined|undefined]] in the [[extended real line]], therefore it and

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\lim\limits_{x \to 0} 1 }{\lim\limits_{x \to 0} x}&lt;/math&gt;

are meaningless [[Expression (mathematics)|expressions]].

===Projectively extended real line===
The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[projectively extended real line]], which is a [[one-point compactification]] of the real line. Here &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; means an [[point at infinity|unsigned infinity]], an infinite quantity that is neither positive nor negative. This quantity satisfies &lt;math&gt;-\infty = \infty&lt;/math&gt;, which is necessary in this context. In this structure, &lt;math&gt;a/0 = \infty&lt;/math&gt; can be defined for nonzero ''a'', and &lt;math&gt;a/\infty = 0&lt;/math&gt;. It is the natural way to view the range of the [[tangent]] function and cotangent functions of [[trigonometry]]: tan(''x'') approaches the single point at infinity as ''x'' approaches either &lt;math&gt;+\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; from either direction.

This definition leads to many interesting results. However, the resulting algebraic structure is not a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], and should not be expected to behave like one. For example, &lt;math&gt;\infty + \infty&lt;/math&gt; is undefined in this extension of the real line.

===Riemann sphere===
The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Riemann sphere]], which is of major importance in [[complex analysis]]. Here too &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; is an unsigned infinity – or, as it is often called in this context, the [[point at infinity]]. This set is analogous to the projectively extended real line, except that it is based on the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[complex number]]s. In the Riemann sphere, &lt;math&gt;1/0=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;0/0&lt;/math&gt; is undefined, as is &lt;math&gt;0\times\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

===Extended non-negative real number line===
{{unsourced|subsection|date=October 2018}}
The negative real numbers can be discarded, and infinity introduced, leading to the set [0,&amp;nbsp;∞], where division by zero can be naturally defined as ''a''/0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞ for positive&amp;nbsp;''a''. While this makes division defined in more cases than usual, subtraction is instead left undefined in many cases, because there are no negative numbers.

==Higher mathematics==
Although division by zero cannot be sensibly defined with real numbers and integers, it is possible to consistently define it, or similar operations, in other mathematical structures.

===Non-standard analysis===
In the [[hyperreal number]]s and the [[surreal number]]s, division by zero is still impossible, but division by non-zero [[infinitesimal]]s is possible.

===Distribution theory===
In [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution theory]] one can extend the function &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; to a distribution on the whole space of real numbers (in effect by using [[Cauchy principal value]]s). It does not, however, make sense to ask for a 'value' of this distribution at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0; a sophisticated answer refers to the [[singular support]] of the distribution.

===Linear algebra===
In [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] algebra (or [[linear algebra]] in general), one can define a pseudo-division, by setting ''a''/''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ab''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, in which ''b''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; represents the [[Moore–Penrose inverse|pseudoinverse]] of ''b''. It can be proven that if ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; exists, then ''b''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. If ''b'' equals 0, then b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.

===Abstract algebra===
Any number system that forms a [[commutative ring]]—for instance, the integers, the real numbers, and the complex numbers—can be extended to a [[wheel theory|wheel]] in which division by zero is always possible; however, in such a case, "division" has a slightly different meaning.

The concepts applied to standard arithmetic are similar to those in more general algebraic structures, such as [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]. In a field, every nonzero element is invertible under multiplication; as above, division poses problems only when attempting to divide by zero. This is likewise true in a [[skew field]] (which for this reason is called a [[division ring]]). However, in other rings, division by nonzero elements may also pose problems. For example, the ring '''Z'''/6'''Z''' of integers mod 6. The meaning of the expression &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2}{2}&lt;/math&gt; should be the solution ''x'' of the equation &lt;math&gt;2x = 2&lt;/math&gt;. But in the ring '''Z'''/6'''Z''', 2 is a [[zero divisor]]. This equation has two distinct solutions, ''x'' = 1 and ''x'' = 4, so the expression &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Defined and undefined|undefined]].

In field theory, the expression &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt; is only shorthand for the formal expression ''ab''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is the multiplicative inverse of ''b''. Since the field axioms only guarantee the existence of such inverses for nonzero elements, this expression has no meaning when ''b'' is zero. Modern texts, that define fields as a special type of ring, include the axiom 0&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;1 for fields (or its equivalent) so that the [[zero ring]] is excluded from being a field. In the zero ring, division by zero is possible, which shows that the other field axioms are not sufficient to exclude division by zero in a field.

==Computer arithmetic==
[[File:TI86 Calculator DivByZero.jpg|thumb|Most calculators, such as this [[Texas Instruments]] [[TI-86]], will halt execution and display an error message when the user or a running program attempts to divide by zero.]]
[[File:Division by zero on android 2.2.1 calculator.png|thumb|196px|x294px|Division by zero on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] 2.2.1 calculator shows the symbol of infinity.]]
The [[IEEE floating-point standard]], supported by almost all modern [[floating-point unit]]s, specifies that every [[floating point]] arithmetic operation, including division by zero, has a well-defined result. The standard supports [[signed zero]], as well as [[infinity]] and [[NaN]] (''not a number''). There are two zeroes: +0 (''positive zero'') and −0 (''negative zero'') and this removes any ambiguity when dividing. In [[IEEE 754]] arithmetic, ''a''&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;+0 is positive infinity when ''a'' is positive, negative infinity when ''a'' is negative, and NaN when ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;±0. The infinity signs change when dividing by [[−0 (number)|−0]] instead.

The justification for this definition is to preserve the sign of the result in case of [[arithmetic underflow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cody|first=W.J.|title=Analysis of Proposals for the Floating-Point Standard|journal=Computer|date=March 1981|volume=14|issue=3|pages=65|doi=10.1109/C-M.1981.220379|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1667286|accessdate=11 September 2012|quote=With appropriate care to be certain that the algebraic signs are not determined by rounding error, the affine mode preserves order relations while fixing up overflow. Thus, for example, the reciprocal of a negative number which underflows is still negative.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the single-precision computation 1/(''x''/2), where ''x'' = ±2&lt;sup&gt;−149&lt;/sup&gt;, the computation ''x''/2 underflows and produces ±0 with sign matching ''x'', and the result will be ±∞ with sign matching ''x''. The sign will match that of the exact result ±2&lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;, but the magnitude of the exact result is too large to represent, so infinity is used to indicate overflow.

Integer division by zero is usually handled differently from floating point since there is no integer representation for the result. Some processors generate an [[exception handling|exception]] when an attempt is made to divide an integer by zero, although others will simply continue and generate an incorrect result for the division. The result depends on how division is implemented, and can either be zero, or sometimes the largest possible integer.

Because of the improper algebraic results of assigning any value to division by zero, many computer [[programming language]]s (including those used by [[calculator]]s) explicitly forbid the execution of the operation and may prematurely halt a program that attempts it, sometimes reporting a "Divide by zero" error. In these cases, if some special behavior is desired for division by zero, the condition must be explicitly tested (for example, using an [[if statement]]). Some programs (especially those that use [[fixed-point arithmetic]] where no dedicated floating-point hardware is available) will use behavior similar to the IEEE standard, using large positive and negative numbers to approximate infinities. In some programming languages, an attempt to divide by zero results in [[undefined behavior]]. The graphical programming language [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch 2]] used in many schools returns Infinity or -Infinity depending on the sign of the dividend.

In [[two's complement]] arithmetic, attempts to divide the smallest signed integer by &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; are attended by similar problems, and are handled with the same range of solutions, from explicit error conditions to [[undefined behavior]].

Most calculators will either return an error or state that 1/0 is undefined; however, some [[Texas Instruments|TI]] and [[Hewlett Packard|HP]] graphing calculators will evaluate (1/0)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to ∞.

[[Microsoft Math]] and [[Mathematica]] return ''ComplexInfinity'' for 1/0. [[Maple (software)|Maple]] and [[SageMath]] return an error message for 1/0, and infinity for 1/0.0 (0.0 tells these systems to use floating point arithmetic instead of algebraic arithmetic).

== Research ==
The economical and social development is featured by an exponential growth of new scientific knowledge today. Informatics and Information Technology (IIT) are playing the key role. They boost the development of all scientific branches, with the creation of new methodological base to make research and development. The development time decreases, the traditional theoretical and experimental abilities are extended broadly, and so on. Informatics has developed to be an autonomous scientific area, which supports the success not only in the branch of information technologies, but has wide consequences to the lives of individuals and society.

It is not a coincidence only that the research in IIT area has become the one research topic among the priority research topics of European Union. This is indicated by the 5th and 6th European Framework Programme and their priorities including IIT. The importance and consequences of IIT research can be demonstrated by their clear support in USA and Japan. This contributes too to the support of IIT in European Union. The example from European Union (which is the most important example for us) shows

the emphasis that the support of IIT research is continual for a long time with perspective to the future (compare the priorities of 4th, 5th and 6th Framework Programme);
that the IIT research is extending to various research areas.

In [[military science]], '''Force multiplication''' or a '''force multiplier''' refers to a factor or a combination of factors that dramatically increases (hence "multiplies") the effectiveness of an item or group, giving a given number of [[troop]]s (or other personnel) or [[weapons]] (or other hardware) the ability to accomplish greater things than without it.  The expected size increase required to have the same effectiveness without that advantage is the ''multiplication factor''.  For example, if a certain technology like [[GPS]] enables a force to accomplish the same results of a force five times as large but without GPS, then the multiplier is five. Such estimates are used to justify an investment cost for force multipliers.

Before the era of modern electronic communications, the Mongols used [[Swarming (military)|swarming tactics]] coordinated by effective [[military communications]] using flags, horns, and couriers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} In the Middle Ages, [[archer's stake]]s were driven into the ground for protection from mounted men-at-arms.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}  This is an example of "[[combined arms]]", another ancient method of force multiplication.

==Types==
Some common force multipliers are:
:* [[Morale]]
:* [[Mobility_(military)|Mobility]]
:* Fearsome [[reputation]]
:* [[Military technology|Technology]]
:* [[Advantage of terrain|Geographical features]]
:* [[Kamikaze (typhoon)|Weather]]
:* [[Military recruitment|Recruitment]] through [[diplomacy]]
:* [[Military education and training|Training]] and [[experience]]
:* [[Military strategy]], such as the [[Fabian strategy]]
:* [[Military tactics]], such as [[force concentration]]
:* [[Intelligence (military)|Intelligence]]
:* [[Military deception|Deception]]

Some factors may influence one another, e.g. enhanced technology improving morale or geographical features allowing deception.

==Doctrinal changes==

In the First World War, the Germans experimented with what were called "storm tactics", where a small group of highly trained soldiers ([[stormtrooper]]s) would open a salient through which much larger forces could penetrate. This met with only limited success, breaking through the first lines of defence but lacking the staying power to break the opposing forces entirely while the 1939 [[Blitzkrieg]], which broke through with coordinated mechanized ground forces with aircraft in close support, was vastly more effective.

Towards the end of World War II, the German army introduced [[kampfgruppe]] combat formations that were composed of whatever units happened to be available. Though poor quality ones generally constituted the major part of them, they often performed successfully because of their high degree of flexibility and adaptability. [[Mission-type tactics]], as opposed to extremely specific directives that give no discretion to the junior commander, are widely used by modern militaries now due to their force multiplication. Originating from German  concepts of ''Auftragstaktik'', these tactics may be developing even more rapidly in the concept of [[network-centric warfare]] (NCW) where subordinate commanders receive information not only from their own commanders, but from adjacent units.

A different paradigm was one of the results of the theories of [[John Boyd (military strategist)|John Boyd]], the "high-low mix" in which a large number of less expensive aircraft, coupled with a small number of extremely capable "silver bullet" aircraft, had the effect of a much larger force. Boyd's concept of quick action is based on the repeated application of the "Boyd loop", consisting of the steps
:*'''Observe''': make use of the best sensors and other intelligence available
:*'''Orient''': put the new observations into a context with the old
:*'''Decide''': select the next action based on the combined observation and local knowledge
:*'''Act''': carry out the selected action, ideally while the opponent is still observing your last action.
Boyd's concept is also known as the [[OODA Loop]], and is a description of the decision-making process that Boyd contended applies to business, sports, law enforcement and military operations. Boyd's doctrine is widely taught in the American military, and one of the aims of network centric warfare is to "get inside his OODA loop"—that is, to go from observation to action before the enemy can get past orientation, preventing him from ever being able to make an effective decision or put it into action. Small unit leadership is critical to this, and NCW's ability to disseminate information to small unit leaders enables such tactics.

[[Network-centric warfare]] can provide additional information and can help prevent [[friendly fire]], but also allows "swarm tactics"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and the seizing of opportunities by subordinate forces. These are a realization of Boyd's theories. {{Harv | Rand-Edwards-2000 | pg. 2}} defines " "a swarming case is any historical example in which the scheme of maneuver involves the convergent attack of five (or more) semiautonomous (or autonomous) units on a targeted force in some particular place. "Convergent" implies an attack from most of the points on the compass."

Another version of "swarming" is evident in air-to-ground attack formations in which the attack aircraft do not approach from one direction, at one time, or at the same altitude, but schedule the attacks so each one requires a Boyd-style OODA iteration to deal with a new threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2017}} Replacement training units (RTU) were "finishing schools" for pilots that needed to know not just the school solution, but the actual tactics being used in Vietnam. Referring to close air support, "In the RTU, new pilots learned the rules of the road for working with a [[Forward air control]]ler (FAC). The hardest part was finding the small aircraft as it circled over the target area. The fast-moving fighters used directional finding/steering equipment to get close enough to the slow, low FAC until someone in the flight could get an eyeball on him—a tally-ho. Once the FAC was in sight, he would give the fighters a target briefing—type of target, elevation, attack heading, location of friendlies, enemy defensive fire, best egress heading if hit by enemy fire, and other pertinent data. Usually the fighters would set up a circle, called a wheel or "wagon wheel", over the FAC, and wait for him to mark the target. Once the
target was marked, the flight leader would attack first.

| accessdate=2010-05-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Morale]], training, and ethos have long been known to result in disproportionate effects on the battlefield.

[[Psychological warfare]] can target the morale, politics, and values of enemy soldiers and their supporters to effectively neutralize them in a conflict.

==Technology==
[[Ranged weapon]]s that hit their target can be far more effective than those that miss. That is why [[rifled musket]]s for infantry and [[rangefinder]]s for artillery became commonplace in the 19th century. 

Two new [[weapons of World War I]], [[barbed wire]] and the [[machine gun]], multiplied defensive forces, leading to the stalemate of [[trench warfare]]. 

===Tankers===

Airborne tanker aircraft, such as the [[Boeing]] [[KC-135]] are a very significant force multiplier.  They can carry fuel so bomber and fighter aircraft can take off loaded with extra weapons instead of full fuel tanks.  The tankers also increase the range and time loitering within or near the target areas by off-loading fuel when it is needed.  Tankers can also be used to rapidly deploy fighters, bombers, SIGNET, Airborne Command Post, and cargo aircraft from the [[United States]] to the areas where they are needed.  The force multiplier of a [[KC-135R]] can be anywhere from 1.5 to as much as 6 when used near the target area.

===Bombers===

At one extreme, a [[stealth aircraft]] like the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit]] [[strategic bomber]] can attack a target without needing the large numbers of escort [[fighter aircraft]], [[electronic-warfare aircraft]], [[Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses]], and other supporting aircraft that would be needed were conventional bombers used against the same target.

[[Precision-guided munition]]s (PGM) give an immense multiplication. The [[Thanh Hoa Bridge]] in [[North Vietnam]] had been only mildly damaged by approximately 800 sorties by aircraft armed with conventional [[Unguided bomb]]s, but had one of its spans destroyed by a 12-plane mission, of which 8 carried [[laser-guided bomb]]s. Two small subsequent missions, again with laser-guided bombs, completed the destruction of this target. Precision guided munitions are one example of what has been called the [[Revolution in Military Affairs]]. In World War II, British night bombers could hit, at best, an area of a city.

Modern PGMs commonly put a bomb within 3–10 meters of its target (see [[Circular error probable]]), and most carry an explosive charge significant enough that this uncertainty is effectively voided. See the [[Special reconnaissance#Ground-aided precision strike: initial experience|use of heavy bombers in direct support of friendly troops]] in Afghanistan, using the technique of Ground-Aided Precision Strike.

===Fighter combat===

[[Fighter aircraft]] coordinated by an [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]] control aircraft, so that they can approach targets without being revealed by their own radar, and who are assigned to take specific targets so that duplication is avoided, are far more effective than an equivalent number of fighters dependent on their own resources for target acquisition.

In exercises between the Indian and US air forces, the Indian pilots had an opportunity to operate with AWACS control, and found it extremely effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/nov/17us.htm
 | title = On AWACS, IAF pilots match US counterparts
 | date = 2005-11-17
 | id = AWACS-IAF-2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has ordered AWACS aircraft, using [[EL/W-2090|Israeli Phalcon electronics on a Russian airframe]], and this exercise is part of their preparation. Officer and pilot comments included "definitely was a force multiplier. Giving you an eye deep beyond you"... "We could pick up incoming targets whether aircraft or missiles almost 400 kilometers away. It gives a grand battle coordination in the air".

==Creating local forces==

The use of small numbers of specialists to create larger effective forces is another form of multiplication. The basic A Team of US Army [[Special Forces]] is a 12-man unit that can train and lead a company-sized unit (100-200 men) of local guerrillas.

==Deception==

[[Deception]] can produce the potential effect of a much larger force. The fictitious [[First United States Army Group]] (FUSAG) was portrayed to the World War II Germans as the main force for the invasion of Europe. [[Operation Bodyguard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | last = Brown
 | title = Bodyguard of Lies: The Extraordinary True Story Behind D-Day

 | isbn = 0-06-010551-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
successfully gave the impression that FUSAG was to land at the [[Pas de Calais]], convincing the Germans that the real attack at [[Normandy]] was a feint. As a result of the successful deception, the Normandy force penetrated deeply, in part, because the Germans held back strategic reserves that they thought would be needed at the [[Pas de Calais]], against what was a nonexistent force. FUSAG's existence was suggested by the use of decoy vehicles that the Allies allowed to be photographed, fictitious radio traffic generated by a small number of specialists, and the [[Double Cross System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | title = The Double-Cross System in the War of 1939–1945.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Double Cross referred to turning all surviving German spies in the UK into [[Clandestine HUMINT#Double Agent|double agents]], who sent back convincing reports that were consistent with the deception programs being conducted by the [[London Controlling Section]].

'''Formline art''' is a feature in the [[Northwest Coast art|indigenous art]] of the [[Pacific Northwest|Northwest Coast]] of North America, distinguished by the use of characteristic shapes referred to as ''ovoids'', ''U forms'' and ''S forms''. Coined by Bill Holm in his 1965 book ''Northwest Coast Indian Art: An Analysis of Form'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-mccord.qc.ca/expositions/expositionsXSL.php?lang=1&amp;expoId=21&amp;currSectionId=7 "Haida Art - Mapping an Ancient Language", musee-mccord.qc.ca.

Retrieved Nov. 22, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; the "formline is the primary design element on which Northwest Coast art depends, and by the turn of the 20th century, its use spread to the southern regions as well. It is the positive delineating force of the painting, relief and engraving. Formlines are continuous, flowing, curvilinear lines that turn, swell and diminish in a prescribed manner. They are used for figure outlines, internal design elements and in abstract compositions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=a1ARTA0005815 Marjorie M. Halpin, "Northwest Coast Native Art," thecanadianencyclopedia.com. Retrieved Nov. 22, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
After European contact, in the late 18th century, the peoples who produced Northwest Coast art suffered huge population losses due to diseases such as [[smallpox]], and cultural losses due to assimilation into European-North [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].  The production of their art dropped drastically as well.

Toward the end of the 19th century, Northwest Coast artists began producing work for commercial sale, such as small [[argillite]] carvings.  The end of the 19th century also saw large-scale export of totem poles, masks and other [[Painting|traditional art]] objects from the region to museums and private collectors around the world.  Some of this export was accompanied by financial compensation to people who had a right to sell the art, and some was not.

In the early 20th century, very few First Nations artists in the Northwest Coast region were producing art.  A tenuous link to older traditions remained in artists such as Charles Gladstone, Stanley George (Heiltsuk) and [[Mungo Martin]].  The mid-20th century saw a revival of interest and production of Northwest Coast art, due to the influence of artists and critics such as [[Bill Reid]], a grandson of Charles Gladstone, and others. This renewal of art is part of a wider cultural and political awakening among First Nations.  It also saw an increasing demand for the return of art objects (known as Repatriation) that were illegally or immorally taken from First Nations communities.  This demand continues to the present day.  Today, there are numerous art schools teaching formal Northwest Coast art of various styles, and there is a growing market for new art in this style.&lt;ref name="Jack2"&gt;Jonathan Meuli.

The term "genreflecting" was first coined by Betty Rosenberg, a prominent [[library science]] educator, in 1982.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Genreflecting: A Guide to Reading Interests in Genre Fiction|last=Rosenberg|first=Betty|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=1982|isbn=978-0872873339|location=Littleton, CO|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that time, the term has been adopted by [[readers' advisory]] in [[Library|libraries]] and extended to [[Non-fiction|nonfiction]] genres as well as fiction. A similar practice in retail bookstores is called "hand-selling."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/Retail-Approach-or-Library-Approach-Shaping-Readers-Advisory-John-Schoppert/pid=5938363|title=Retail Approach or Library Approach? Shaping Readers' Advisory, by John  Schoppert {{!}} Booklist Online|website=www.booklistonline.com|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At the time the first edition of Rosenberg's ''Genreflecting'' was written, adding popular reading materials to library collections and recommending those titles to readers were controversial practices. Dr. Rosenberg's First Law of Reading—"Never apologize for your reading taste"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;—has since been adopted by growing numbers of [[librarian]]s, and the field of [[readers' advisory]] has become increasingly central to the practice of [[Library science|librarianship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2014/02/library-services/the-state-of-readers-advisory/#_|title=The State of Readers’ Advisory|newspaper=Library Journal|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancy Pearl]], the well known model of the librarian [[action figure]] and author of ''[[Book Lust]]'' and ''More Book Lust,'' has promoted and further popularized the practice of readers' advisory within the library community and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://litreactor.com/columns/readers-advisory-expert-advice-on-what-to-read-next|title=Library Love: Reader’s Advisory - Expert Advice On What To Read Next|newspaper=LitReactor|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, a number of [[online database]]s have been developed to assist readers' advisors find "read-alikes," including ''What Do I Read Next?'' (Gale Thomson), ''NoveList'' ([[EBSCO Information Services|EBSCO]]), ''The Reader's Advisor Online'' ([[Greenwood Publishing Group]]), ''Fiction Connection'' (Bowker), and ''Booklist Online'' ([[American Library Association]]).

'''Idiom''' is the syntactical, grammatical, or structural form peculiar to a [[language]].&lt;ref name="MWCD"&gt;{{Citation | author = Merriam-Webster | authorlink = Merriam-Webster | title = Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary | publisher = Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Idiom is the realized structure of a language, as opposed to possible but unrealized structures that could have developed to serve the same [[semantic]] functions but did not.

Language grammar and syntax is often inherently arbitrary and peculiar to a particular language or a [[language family|group of related languages]]. For example, although in English it is ''idiomatic'' (accepted as structurally correct) to say "cats are associated with agility", other forms could have developed, such as "cats associate toward agility" or "cats are associated of agility".&lt;ref name="Garner_2016_headword_accompanied"&gt;{{Citation |last=Garner |first=Bryan A. |author-link=Bryan A. Garner |year=2016 |title=Garner's Modern English Usage |edition=4th |location=headword "accompanied" |url=http://www.lawprose.org/bryan-garner/books-by-bryan-garner/garners-modern-english-usage-4th-edition-2016/ |isbn=978-0190491482 |quote=Idiom requires ''accompanied by'', not ''*accompanied with''—e.g.: '[…] sliced in half and accompanied with [read ''accompanied by''] no more than a small scoop of ice cream.' |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unidiomatic constructions sound wrong to fluent speakers, although they are often entirely comprehensible. For example, the title of the classic book ''[[English As She Is Spoke]]'' is easy to understand (its idiomatic counterpart is ''English As It Is Spoken''), but it deviates from English idiom in the [[grammatical gender|gender]] of the pronoun and the [[inflection]] of the verb. [[Accidental gap|Lexical gaps]] are another key example of idiom.

==Emic and etic views==
[[Monolingual]] native speakers in an insulated monolingual-native environment are mostly not conscious of ''idiomaticness'' (the quality or state of a construction matching the idiom of the given language), because in general their minds never reach for, or hear, other possible structures. The main exception is when they hear the natural experimentation of children acquiring the language, when they may encounter, for example, [[overregularization]] (for example, ''I seed two deers'' for ''I saw two deer''). By this correlation, [[solecism]] to native-speaking monolingual minds often sounds childish. However, when adults study a foreign language, they become consciously aware of idiomaticness and the lack of it. For example, in English it is idiomatic to use an [[article (grammar)#Indefinite article|indefinite article]] when describing a person's occupation (''I am '''a''' plumber''; ''she is '''an''' engineer''), but in Spanish and many other languages it is not (''soy plomero''; ''ella es ingeniera''), and a native speaker of English learning Spanish must encounter and accept that fact to become fluent.

The [[count noun|count]] [[word sense|sense]] of the word ''idiom'', referring to [[idiom|a saying with a figurative meaning]], is related to the present sense of the word by the arbitrariness and peculiarity aspects; the idiom "she is pulling my leg" (meaning "she is humorously misleading me") is idiomatic because it belongs, by convention, to the language, whether or not anyone can identify the original logic by which it was coined (arbitrariness), and regardless of whether it translates literally to any other language (peculiarity).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2558">The word '''indignation''' is used to describe strong displeasure at something considered unjust, offensive, insulting or unrighteous.

==History==

The term was coined in [[France]] during the 12th Century. It comes from the Latin word ''indignationem'', meaning displeasure. In [[nominative]] form, ''indignationem'' is ''indignatio''. ''Indignation'' is a noun of action from the past participle stem of ''indignari'', meaning unworthy, to be angry at, or to be displeased with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=indignation|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==

According to Cicero’s ''De Inventione'', Book I, “indignation is a kind of speech by which the effect produced is, that great hatred is excited against a man, or dislike of some proceeding is originated.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/cicero/dnv1-4.htm|title=Cicero's De Inventione, Book I, translated by C. D. Yonge, at Peitho's Web|work=classicpersuasion.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is for the speaker to create anger projected towards the opponent or the accused such that the speaker is seen more positively than the opponent. One of the features of ''indignatio'' is that it cannot function without a target of displeasure. To successfully employ the technique, the speaker must have a target, an audience with which the speaker identifies, and a desired reaction. If a speaker achieves a reaction from the audience in which they are displeased with his opponent, then the speaker has successfully employed ''indignation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhetconcepts.wordpress.com/2011/12/06/indignatio-overview/|title=Indignatio: Overview|work=Rhetorical Devices and Concepts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristotle==

[[Aristotle]] wrote in his Book II, Chapter 9, “indignation is the emotion most directly opposed to pity.” Aristotle also writes “Indignation is pain caused by the sight of undeserved good fortune.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.cs.uri.edu/courses/fall2007/csc305/Schedule/rhetoric/rhet29.htm|title=Aristotle's Rhetoric: Book II - Chapter 9|work=uri.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms indignation and indignatio are closely related in part by their common negative emotionality and anger. A speaker may successfully employ indignatio and the audience will feel indignation towards the opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet2-9.html|title=Book II - Chapter 9|work=eserver.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological field project consultancies ==
The Institute is involved in a series of ecological demonstration projects, selected in challenging biomes facing ecological degradation and cultural conflict. These were chosen because conventional approaches do not work, requiring innovative, "ecotechic" approaches with the goals of ecological upgrade, economic sustainability and to develop the capabilities of I.E. members and associates. The projects, and the Heraclitus, are places where hands-on educational programsand volunteer opportunities are provided.

Synergia Ranch, started in 1969, was the Institute's first ecological field project. There on 130 acres of desertifying high altitude sem-arid juniper/pinon grasslands, I.E. developed a program to restore the land, with the goal of creating an oasis in the desert. Over a thousand trees were planted, including 450 fruit trees, organic vegetable gardens and an extensive soil-building program using compost to restore lost fertility to an area which had been overgrazed and cleared for inappropriate broad-acre farming in the 1920s. Adobe buildings and a geodesic dome were built and artisan enterprises started including pottery, woodworking, iron working, clothing, leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wastewater Gardener: Preserving the Planet One Flush at a Time|last=Nelson|first=Mark|publisher=Synergetic Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0907791515|location=Santa Fe, NM|pages=Chapter 2, Flower Power at Synergia Ranch}}&lt;/ref&gt; A construction firm build some three dozen adobe buildings in Santa Fe, contributing to a renaissance of traditional adobe architecture. The orchards and vegetable gardens are certified organic and in 2016 Synergia Ranch won the Good Earth award at the New Mexico Organic Agriculture conference in recognition of its land care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://farmersmarketinstitute.org/news-and-events/synergia-ranch-good-earth-award/|title=Synergia Ranch Good Earth Award|last=Alexis|first=|date=February 23, 2017|website=Santa Fe Farmers Market Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecotechnic life style approach was to balance by engaging in three lines of work: ecology, enterprise and theater. The Theater of All Possibilities was based at Synergia Ranch for over a decade.

Les Marronniers near Aix-en-Provence, France, begun in 1976 is the ecotechnic field project in the Mediterranean biome. It has also served as a frequent location for the international conferences which I.E. organizes bringing together scientists, artists, engineers, managers and thinkers to engage on topics of broad interest. Les Marronniers has also revivified on 7 ha (17 acres) the mixed agriculture small holdings traditional in the area, with orchard, grapes, field crops, woodlot, domestic animals and art/sculpture workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecotechnics.edu/2011/02/les-marronniers-southern-france/|title=Les Marronniers Southern France|last=|first=|date=|website=Institute of Ecotechnics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birdwood Downs, a 4300 acre property in the Kimberley region of NW Western Australia, is the Institute's tropical savannah biomic project.

Recognizing that cities, part of the anthropogenic urban biome, are crucial players in the biosphere, I.E. helped establish the [[October Gallery]] in London in 1979 as its world city project. The October Gallery's goal is to find and showcase cutting-edge artists of the "transvangarde" from around the world. It also supports a robust educational program bringing many London school children into the gallery to meet artists and make art, as well as traveling exhibitions. Designed as a place where science and art can interact, it also hosts scientific, cultural and musical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.octobergallery.co.uk/|title=October Gallery: Contemporary Art from Around the Planet|last=|first=|date=|website=October Gallery|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the Las Casas de la Selva project in Patillas, Puerto Rico became I.E. tropical rainforest project. On almost 1000 acres of mountainous secondary forest, the goal of the project is to show innovative methods of forest enrichment and to promote sustainable tropical forestry. With the cooperation of Puerto Rican departments of development and forestry, some 40,000 seedlings of valuable timber species were planted on one-third of the land. Line-planting was employed to minimize the impact on the surrounding forest and to conserve biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Mark|last2=et. al.|date=|title=The Impact of Hardwood Line-Planting on Tree and Amphibian Biodiversity in a Secondary Wet Tropical Forest,  Southeast Puerto Rico|url=|journal=Journal of Sustainable Forestry|volume=(2010) 29(5)|pages=503–516|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Mark|last2=et. al.|date=|title=Enriched secondary subtropical forest through line-planting for sustainable timber production in Puerto Rico|url=|journal=Bois et Forêts des Tropiques|volume=(November 2011) 309(3)|pages=51–63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Las Casas won the 2016 Energy Globe national award for Puerto Rico and is recovering from severe damage caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9372">In [[astronomy]], '''interplanetary scintillation''' refers to random fluctuations in the intensity of [[radio wave]]s of [[Sky|celestial]] origin, on the timescale of a few seconds. It is analogous to the [[Twinkling (astronomy)|twinkling]] one sees looking at [[star]]s in the [[sky]] at night, but in the radio part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] rather than the [[visible spectrum|visible one]]. Interplanetary scintillation is the result of radio waves traveling through fluctuations in the density of the [[electron]] and [[proton]]s that make up the [[solar wind]].

==Early study==
Scintillation in radio waves due to the [[ionosphere]] was observed as early as 1951 by [[Antony Hewish]], and he then reported irregularities in radiation received during an observation of a bright radio source in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Hewish (1955), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Hewish considered various possibilities, and suggested that irregularities in the [[solar corona]] would cause [[scattering]] by [[refraction]] and could produce the irregularities he observed.&lt;ref&gt;Hewish (1955), pp. 242–244.&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, while making [[astrometric]] observations of several bright sources of celestial radio waves using a [[radio interferometer]], Hewish and two collaborators reported "unusual fluctuations of intensity" in a few of the sources.&lt;ref&gt;Hewish (1964), p. 1214.&lt;/ref&gt; The data strongly supported the notion that the fluctuations resulted from irregularities in the density of the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] associated with the [[solar wind]], which the authors called interplanetary scintillation,&lt;ref&gt;Hewish (1964), p. 1215.&lt;/ref&gt; and is recognized as the "discovery of the interplanetary scintillation phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;Alurkar (1997), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to study interplanetary scintillation, Hewish built the [[Interplanetary Scintillation Array]] at the [[Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory]]. The array consisted of 2,048 [[dipole]]s over almost five [[acre]]s of land, and was built to constantly survey the sky at a time resolution of about 0.1 [[second]]s. This high time resolution set it apart from many other [[radio telescope]]s of the time, as astronomers did not expect emission from an object to feature such rapid variation.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester (1977), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after observations were under way, Hewish's student [[Jocelyn Bell]] turned this assumption on its head, when she noticed a signal which was soon recognized as emanating from a new class of object, the [[pulsar]]. Thus "it was an investigation of interplanetary scintillation that led to the discovery of pulsars, even though the discovery was a by-product rather than the purpose of the investigation."&lt;ref&gt;Lyne (1990). p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Scintillation occurs as a result of variations in the [[refractive index]] of the medium through which waves are traveling. The [[solar wind]] is a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], composed primarily of [[electron]]s and lone [[proton]]s, and the variations in the index of refraction are caused by variations in the [[density]] of the plasma.&lt;ref&gt;Jokipii (1973), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Different indices of refraction result in [[phase (waves)|phase]] changes between waves traveling through different locations, which results in [[interference (physics)|interference]]. As the waves interfere, both the [[frequency]] of the wave and its [[angular size]] are broadened, and the intensity varies.&lt;ref&gt;Alurkar (1997), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Solar wind===
As interplanetary scintillation is caused by the [[solar wind]], measurements of interplanetary scintillation can "be utilized as valuable and inexpensive probes of the solar wind."&lt;ref&gt;Jokipii (1973), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; As already noted, the observed information, the intensity fluctuations, is related to the desired information, the structure of the solar wind, through the phase change experienced by waves traveling through the solar wind. The [[root mean square]] (RMS) intensity fluctuations are often expressed relative to the mean intensity from the source, in a term called the scintillation index, which is written as

&lt;math&gt;
m = \frac{\langle \Delta I^2 \rangle^{1/2}}{\langle I \rangle}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This can be related to the phase deviation caused by turbulence in the solar wind by considering the incident [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] plane wave, and yields

&lt;math&gt;
m \approx \sqrt{2}\Delta \phi.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alurkar (1997), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step, relating the phase change to the density structure of the solar wind, can be made more simple by assuming that the density of the plasma is highest towards the sun, which allows the "thin screen approximation." Doing so eventually gives an RMS deviation for the phase of

&lt;math&gt;
\phi_{RMS} = \lambda r_e \left( a L \right)^{1/2} \left[ \langle \delta N^2 \rangle \right]^{1/2},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alurkar (1997), pp. 39–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength of the incoming wave, &lt;math&gt;r_e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[classical electron radius]], &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the thickness of the "screen," or the length scale over which the majority of the scattering takes place, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the typical size scale of density irregularities, and &lt;math&gt;\delta N^2&lt;/math&gt; is the root mean squared variation of the electron density about the mean density. Thus interplanetary scintillation can be used as a probe of the density of the solar wind. Interplanetary scintillation measurements may also be used to infer the velocity of the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;Jokipii (1973), pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stable features of the solar wind can be particularly well studied. At a given time, observers on [[Earth]] have a fixed line of sight through the solar wind, but as the Sun rotates over an approximately month-long [[Rotational period|period]], the perspective on Earth changes. It is then possible to do "[[tomographic reconstruction]] of the distribution of the solar wind" for the features of the solar wind which remain static.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Murchison Widefield Array: Interplanetary Scintillation | url = http://www.mwatelescope.org/science/shi/ips.html | accessdate = 2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compact sources===
The [[power spectrum]] that is observed from a source which has experienced interplanetary scintillation is dependent upon the [[angular size]] of the source.&lt;ref&gt;Shishov (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus interplanetary scintillation measurements can be used to determine the size of compact radio sources, such as [[active galactic nuclei]].&lt;ref&gt;Artyukh (2001), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

This tusk, which is nearly five foot long, illustrates forty three events in the life of the [[Buddha]] and is thought to have been made by early 20th century craftsmen from the Delhi region.

==Description==
The use of the complete ivory tusks for carving was popular in 18th and 19th century India, particularly in the [[Delhi]] region apart from [[Burma]]. Similar whole tusk carvings are also found in the [[Ivory Coast]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The art of [[ivory]] carving in India is very ancient with references found in [[Kalidasa|Kalidasa's]] [[Meghadūta]]. The earliest ivory carving from the Indian region is comb dating to the 2nd century CE found at [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]]. Ivory carving flourished in [[Assam]] and [[Mysore]] where elephants were available and the art of ivory carving had royal patronage. Ivory was an object of trade between kingdoms and they found their way into areas where the art of carving had patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

This ivory tusk illustrates important life events of [[The life of the Buddha|Buddha]] in 43 circular roundel, first 25 referring to the story of Buddha's birth to his enlightenment followed by 18 depicting his life events from enlightenment to ''Mahaparinirvana''. Similar scenes have been presented in sculptures and paintings many a times but this ivory tusk shows few new scenes of Buddha's life such as Siddharatha's fight for a bird, his move against animal sacrifice and realization of death. As the thickness of the tusk reduces upwards, one can see at the tip three well-known postures depicting ''Bhumisparsha mudra'', ''Abhayamudra'' and ''Dharmachakrapravatan mudra'' besides the roundels. There is also an intricately carved floral creeper banding around the roundels enhancing its beauty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10029">'''Kahn process networks''' (''KPNs'', or ''process networks'') is a [[Distributed computing|distributed]] ''[[model of computation]]'' where a group of deterministic sequential [[process (computing)|processes]] are communicating through unbounded [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] channels. The resulting process network exhibits deterministic behavior that does not depend on the various computation or communication delays. The model was originally developed for modeling [[distributed systems]] but has proven its convenience for modeling [[signal processing]] systems. As such, KPNs have found many applications in modeling [[embedded systems]], [[high-performance computing]] systems, and other computational tasks. KPNs were first introduced by [[Gilles Kahn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Kahn |first=G. |year=1974 |url=http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/papers/kahn1974semantics.pdf |title=The semantics of a simple language for parallel programming |editor-first=Jack L. |editor-last=Rosenfeld |conference=Proc. IFIP Congress on Information Processing |publisher=North-Holland |isbn=0-7204-2803-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Basic Kahn Process Network.svg|thumb|right|A Kahn process network of three processes without feedback communication. Edges A, B and C are communication channels. One of the processes is named process P.]]

==Execution model==
KPN is a common model for describing [[signal processing]] systems where infinite streams of data are incrementally transformed by processes executing in sequence or parallel. Despite parallel processes, [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] or [[parallel computing|parallelism]] are not required for executing this model.

In a KPN, processes communicate via unbounded [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] channels. Processes read and write atomic [[data element]]s, or alternatively called [[Token (parser)|tokens]], from and to channels. Writing to a channel is [[Non-blocking I/O|non-blocking]], i.e. it always succeeds and does not stall the process, while reading from a channel is ''blocking'', i.e. a process that reads from an empty channel will stall and can only continue when the channel contains sufficient data items (''tokens''). Processes are not allowed to test an input channel for existence of tokens without consuming them. A FIFO cannot be consumed by multiple processes, nor can multiple processes produce to a single FIFO. Given a specific input (token) history for a process, the process must be deterministic so that it always produces the same outputs (tokens). Timing or execution order of processes must not affect the result and therefore testing input channels for tokens is forbidden. 

===Notes on processes===
* A process need not read any input or have any input channels as it may act as a pure data source
* A process need not write any output or have any output channels
* Testing input channels for emptiness (or ''non-blocking reads'') could be allowed for optimization purposes, but it should not affect outputs. It can be beneficial and/or possible to do something in advance rather than wait for a channel. For example, assume there were 2 reads from different channels. If the first read would stall (wait for a token) but the second read could be read a token directly, it could be beneficial to read the second one first to save time, because the reading itself often consumes some time (e.g. time for memory allocation or copying).

===Process firing semantics as Petri nets===
[[File:Kahn process network as Petri net.svg|thumb|right|Firing semantics of process P modeled with a [[Petri net]] displayed in the image above]]
Assuming process ''P'' in the KPN above is constructed so that it first reads data from channel ''A'', then channel ''B'', computes something and then writes data to channel ''C'', the execution model of the process can be modeled with the [[Petri net]] shown on the right. The single token in the ''PE resource'' place forbids that the process is executed simultaneously for different input data. When data arrives at channel ''A'' or ''B'', tokens are placed into places ''FIFO A'' and ''FIFO B'' respectively. The transitions of the Petri net are associated with the respective I/O operations and computation. When the data has been written to channel ''C'', ''PE resource'' is filled with its initial marking again allowing new data to be read.

===Process as a finite state machine===
[[File:KPN as finite state machine.svg|thumb|right|A finite state machine of a process]]
A process can be modeled as a finite state machine that is in one of two states:

* Active; the process computes or writes data
* Wait; the process is blocked (waiting) for data
Assuming the finite state machine reads program elements associated with the process, it may read three kinds of tokens, which are "Compute", "Read" and "Write token". Additionally, in the ''Wait'' state it can only come back to ''Active'' state by reading a special "Get token" which means the communication channel associated with the wait contains readable data.

==Properties==
===Boundedness of channels===
A channel is ''strictly bounded'' by &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; if it has at most &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; unconsumed tokens for any possible execution. A KPN is ''strictly bounded'' by &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; if all channels are strictly bounded by &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

The number of unconsumed tokens depends on the execution order ('''scheduling''') of processes. A spontaneous data source could produce arbitrarily many tokens into a channel if the scheduler would not execute processes consuming those tokens.

A real application can not have unbounded FIFOs and therefore scheduling and maximum capacity of FIFOs must be designed into a practical implementation. The maximum capacity of FIFOs can be handled in several ways:
* FIFO bounds can be mathematically derived in design to avoid FIFO overflows. This is however not possible for all KPNs. It is an undecidable problem to test whether a KPN is strictly bounded by &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Moreover, in practical situations, the bound may be data dependent.
* FIFO bounds can be grown on demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Parks |first=Thomas M. |year=1995 |url=http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/publications/papers/95/parksThesis/ |type=Ph. D. |title=Bounded Scheduling of Process Networks |publisher=University of California, Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blocking writes can be used so that a process blocks if a FIFO is full. This approach may unfortunately lead to an artificial deadlock unless the designer properly derives safe bounds for FIFOs (Parks, 1995). Local artificial detection at run-time may be necessary to guarantee the production of the correct output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |last1=Geilen |first1=Marc |last2=Basten |first2=Twan |title=Requirements on the Execution of Kahn Process Networks |editor-first=P. |editor-last=Degano |conference=Proc. 12th European Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems (ESOP) |pages=319–334 |year=2003 |publisher=Springer |citeseerx=10.1.1.12.7148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closed and open systems===
A ''closed KPN'' has no external input or output channels. Processes that have no input channels act as data sources and processes that have no output channels act as data sinks. In an ''open KPN'' each process has at least one input and output channel.

===Determinism===
Processes of a KPN are [[deterministic]]. For the same input history they must always produce exactly the same output. Processes can be modeled as sequential programs that do reads and writes to ports in any order or quantity as long as determinism property is preserved. As a consequence, KPN model is deterministic so that following factors entirely determine outputs of the system:

* processes
* the network
* initial tokens

Hence, timing of the processes does not affect outputs of the system.

===Monotonicity===
KPN processes are ''monotonic'', which means that they only need partial information of the input stream in order to produce partial information of the output stream. [[Monotonicity]] allows parallelism. In a KPN there is a [[total order]] of events{{clarify|date=October 2010}} inside a signal.{{clarify|date=October 2010}} However, there is no order relation between events in different signals. Thus, KPNs are only partially ordered, which classifies them as [[untimed model]].

==Applications==
Due to its high expressiveness and succinctness, KPNs as underlying the model of computation are applied in several academic modeling tools to represent streaming applications, which have certain properties (e.g., dataflow-oriented, stream-based). 

The open source Daedalus framework&lt;ref&gt;http://daedalus.liacs.nl LIACS Daedalus framework&lt;/ref&gt; maintained by Leiden Embedded Research Center at [[Leiden University]] accepts sequential programs written in C and generates a corresponding KPN. This KPN could, for example, be used to map the KPN onto an [[field-programmable gate array|FPGA]]-based platform systematically.

The [[Ambric]] Am2045 [[massively parallel processor array]] is a KPN implemented in actual silicon.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Butts, Anthony Mark Jones, Paul Wasson, "A Structural Object Programming Model, Architecture, Chip and Tools for Reconfigurable Computing", Proceedings of [[FCCM]], April 2007, [[IEEE Computer Society]]&lt;/ref&gt; Its 336 32-bit processors are connected by a programmable interconnect of dedicated FIFOs. Thus its channels are strictly bounded with blocking writes.

Kodaikanal [[mercury poisoning]] is a proven case of [[mercury contamination]] by ([[Hindustan Unilever]]) in the process of making mercury [[thermometer]]s for export around the world. The exposure of the environmental abuse led to the closure of the factory in 2001 and opened up a series of issues in India such as [[corporate liability]], [[corporate accountability]] and corporate negligence.

==Kodaikanal==
[[File:Kodai Lake.jpg|thumb|Kodaikanal Lake, the most popular tourist attraction, also contaminated&lt;ref&gt;The Hindu,

[[Kodaikanal]] is a hill station located 7,000 feet above the sea level in the high ranges of [[Palani Hills]] in the Southern Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]], often referred as Princess of Hill Stations. It is a popular vacation spot in Southern [[India]] with Indian and international tourists visiting the site in the summer months of March to June. Kodaikanal was established in 1845 by the [[British Raj]] as a place of escape from the high temperatures and [[tropical disease]]s of the plains. The region's economy thrives on tourism and a large number of hotels and restaurants have come up in the region following the growth of the hospitality industry. Kodaikanal also has the rare distinction of being home to Blue Kurinji (''[[Strobilanthes kunthiana]]''), flowering once in 12 years. The flowering season attracts tourists from around the world.

[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is a [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] and is commonly known as quicksilver. It is the only metal that is a liquid in standard condition of pressure and temperature. Heavy and silvery, mercury is dangerous to flora and fauna even in small doses. In human beings, continuous exposure to mercury leads to damage or impairment of the brain, kidneys and liver. Mercury is used for industrial purposes such as making [[thermometer]]s, [[barometers]], [[sphygmomanometers]], and [[fluorescent lamps]]. Of late, use of mercury-dependent devices have been phased out around the world and the industry has moved to digital devices replacing mercury devices.

==Mercury pollution in Kodaikanal==
The mercury contamination in [[Kodaikanal]] originated at a [[thermometer]] factory that was owned by [[Hindustan Unilever]]. [[Unilever]] acquired the thermometer factory from cosmetics maker [[Pond's|Pond's India Ltd.]] Pond's moved the factory from the United States to India in 1982 after the plant owned there by its parent, Chesebrough-Pond's, had to be dismantled following increased awareness in developed countries of polluting industries. In 1987, Pond's India and the thermometer factory went to Hindustan Unilever when it acquired Cheseborough-Pond's globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Los Angeles |first=Times|title=Unilever Acquires Chesebrough Ponds Globally|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-02/business/fi-665_1_tender-offer|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The factory imported mercury from the United States, and exported finished thermometers to markets in the United States and Europe. Around 2001, a number of workers at the factory began complaining of [[kidney]] and related ailments. Public interest groups such as Tamil Nadu Alliance Against Mercury (TNAAC) alleged that the Company had been disposing mercury waste without following proper protocols. In early 2001, public interest groups unearthed a pile of broken glass thermometers with remains of Mercury from an interior of part of the [[shola]] forest, which they suspected could have come from the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence M|first=Salinger|title=Encyclopedia of White-Collar &amp; Corporate Crime, Volume 1|url=http://www.sagepub.com/refbooks/Book226269|publisher=Sage Publications|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, a public protest led by local workers' union and international environmental organisation [[Greenpeace]] forced the company to shut down the factory. Soon the company admitted that it did dispose of mercury contaminated waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Basel Action Network|first=NGO|title=Hindustan Lever admits dumping Mercury Waste|url=http://ban.org/ban_news/hindustanlever.html|publisher=Ban NGO|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Toxic|first=Link|title=Hindustan Lever Admits Dumping Mercury Waste|url=http://toxicslink.org/?q=article/hindustan-lever-admits-dumping-mercury-containing-wastes|publisher=Toxic Link|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company said in its 2002 annual report and its latest Sustainability Report that it did not dump glass waste contaminated with mercury on the land behind its factory, but only a quantity of 5.3 metric tonnes of glass containing 0.15% residual mercury had been sold to a scrap recycler located about three kilometers from the factory, in breach of the company procedures. Quoting a report prepared by an international environmental consultant, Unilever said there was no health effect on the workers of the factory&lt;ref name="Unilever report update"&gt;{{cite web|title=Update on Kodai for online sustainability report for Unilever.com|url=http://www.hul.co.in/Images/Update_on_Erstwhile_Kodaikanal_Factory_tcm114-195572.pdf|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any impact on the environment.&lt;ref name="URS Dames &amp; Moore"&gt;{{cite web|title=HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED Report and Accounts 2002|url=http://www.hul.co.in/Images/AnnualReport2002_tcm114-309426.pdf|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse dumping==
Once the factory was shut down, public interest groups demanded the return of the remaining mercury waste to the United States for recycling, remediation of the factory site, and address of the health complaints of the workers. Local groups and workers' union under the leadership of [[Greenpeace]], represented to the company, regulatory bodies, and the government, besides initiating legal action against the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Hindu|first=Business Line|title=Mercury Waste to Leave for NY|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2003/05/05/stories/2003050501700300.htm|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenpeace campaigner Ameer Shahul led the public affairs groups and workers collaboration in forcing the Company to collect 290 tonnes of dumped mercury waste from the shola forest and send back to the United States for recycling in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=New York|first=Times|title=Unilever's Mercury Waste Sends Backs to the US|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/07/world/hazardous-waste-is-shipped-from-india-to-us-recycling-plant.html|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=High|first=Beam|title=Mercury Waste Sends Back to the US|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-73787744.html|publisher=High Beam|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was widely hailed by the media as ‘reverse dumping’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Times of India|first=New Delhi|title=First Ever Case of Reverse Dumping|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-04-17/india/27275673_1_thermometer-factory-mercury-pollution-mercury-contamination|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Greenpeace campaigners Ameer Shahul and Navroz Mody led the groups in lobbying for remediation of the site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fernando|first=A C|title=Business Ethics And Corporate Governance|date=1 Sep 2010|publisher=Pearson Education India|location=New Delhi|page=9.14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_32bJs_nfNIC&amp;pg=SA9-PA14&amp;lpg=SA9-PA14&amp;dq=Navroz+Mody,+Ameer+Shahul+Greenpeace&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7gbY3EKBb6&amp;sig=sPNTWCdZojs7O6nhbwkTgPnN94w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NdzxUo_eIYHZige_nYCIBg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Navroz%20Mody%2C%20Ameer%20Shahul%20Greenpeace&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and initiated an investigation by the [[Department of Atomic Energy]] of [[Government of India]], which found that the free mercury level in the atmosphere of Kodaikanal was 1000 times more than what is found in normal conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Journal|first=Environmental Pollution|title=Studies of mercury pollution in a lake due to a thermometer factory situated in Kodaikkanal|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deccan|first=Herald|title=Closed Unilver factory source of Mercury Pollution|url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Deccanherald/jan172004/n9.asp|publisher=Deccan Herald|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenpeace|first=International|title=Mercury Levels in Kodai still High|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/news/the-department-of-atomic-resea/|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of water, sediment and fish samples collected from Kodaikanal Lake by a team of scientists of the Department of Atomic Energy showed elevated levels of mercury four years after the stoppage of mercury emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Journal|first=Environmental Pollution|title=Mercury pollution in a lake due to a thermometer factory situated in Kodaikkanal|url=http://www.journals.elsevier.com/environmental-pollution/|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of scientific studies have also been carried out by Governmental and non-governmental organisations to determine the extent of damage caused to the environment and to the people who were exposed to mercury in the factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cuddalore|first=SIPCOT|title=Studies and Reports on environmental pollution and public health hazard caused by Hindustan Lever in Kodaikanal|url=http://www.sipcotcuddalore.com/Kodaikanal/studies.htm|publisher=SipcotCuddalore|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remediation of the site==
Greenpeace and workers' unions continued to mount pressure on the company to take responsibility for the dumping crimes it had committed and for meddling with a pristine environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenpeace|first=International|title=Prosecute HLL for Forest Crimes|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/news/prosecute-hll-for-forest-crime/|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They asked the regulatory bodies to prosecute the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenpeace|first=International|title=Prosecute HLL|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/news/greenpeace-calls-on-hindustan/|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these demands, public interest groups led by Greenpeace campaign head Shahul spooked the annual general body meeting of [[Hindustan Unilever]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenpeace|first=International|title=Greenpeace Spooks Hindustan Unilever Annual General Body Meeting|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/news/greenpeace-spooks-hll-agm-dem/|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the company began working with the regulatory body Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to remediate the soil, de-contaminate and scrap the thermometer-making equipment at the Kodaikanal site. The company appointed [[National Environmental Engineering Research Institute]] (NEERI) to finalise the scope for remediation, which was vehemently opposed by environmentalists. In 2006, the plant, machinery and materials used in thermometer manufacturing at the site were decontaminated and disposed off as scrap to industrial recyclers. In the following year, NEERI conducted trials at the factory for remediation of the contaminated soil on site, and recommended a remediation protocol of soil washing and thermal retorting. These were hotly contested by environmental groups under the leadership of Nityanand Jayaraman. Ultimately, the [[Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board]] (TNPCB) recommended a remediation standard of up to 20&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of mercury concentration in soil, which means 95% of the samples analysed after the remediation process should be of less than 20&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. Consequently, pre-remediation work started in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unilever|first=Inc|title=Facts About Kodaikanal Thermometer Factory|url=http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/Respondingtostakeholderconcerns/India/|publisher=Unilever|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public interest groups contested the soil clean-up criteria and alleged that TNPCB is helping Unilever clean up to lower standards to cut costs. The acceptable mercury level being suggested by TNPCB is at least 20 times higher than what Unilever would have been required to do if they had caused the same contamination in the United Kingdom, where they are based. They also called for transparency and public participation in the process of deciding the levels of clean-up and in the process of clean-up.

==Workers' health problems==
After the shut down of the factory, health specialists from Bangalore-based Community Health Centre conducted a survey among the former workers of the factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Health|first=Problems|title=Workers Health Issues due to Mercury Exposure|url=http://www.indiatogether.org/environment/articles/unilever.htm|publisher=India Together|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It found that former workers of the factory had visible signs of [[mercury poisoning]] such as gum and skin allergy and related problems, ‘which appeared to be due to exposure to mercury'.

The company claims&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kodaikanal Mercury Factory – Contamination Response, India|url=http://www.hul.co.in/mediacentre/newsandfeatures/2015/Kodaikanal-India.aspx|website=Hindustan Unilever Limited|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latest response from HUL|url=https://www.unilever.com/news/news-and-features/2015/update-on-Kodaikanal-India.html|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that comprehensive [[occupational safety and health]] systems existed at the Kodaikanal factory prior to its closure in 2001. Internal monitoring within the factory and external audits carried out by statutory authorities during the operations of the factory showed that there were no adverse health effects to the workers on account of their employment at the factory. It says there had been a comprehensive medical examination conducted by a panel of doctors using a questionnaire developed by Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) of the [[United States Department of Labor]]; a study by the Certifying Surgeon from the Inspectorate of Factories; an assessment by Dr P N Viswanathan of [[Indian Institute of Toxicology Research]] (IITR); a study by Dr Tom van Teuenbroek of TNO; and a study by IITR, formerly known as Industrial Toxicology Research Centre(ITRC) as directed by a Monitoring Committee set up by the [[Supreme Court of India]].

The company says its conclusions of its occupational health surveillance were also endorsed by the [[All India Institute of Medical Sciences]] (AIIMS) and the [[National Institute of Occupational Health]] (NIOH).

In February 2006, a group of ex-employees of the factory approached the [[Madras High Court]] seeking directions for conducting a fresh health survey and providing economic rehabilitation. A year later, the [[Madras High Court]] constituted a five-member expert committee, with representatives from ITRC, AIIMS and NIOH to decide whether the alleged health conditions of the workers and their families were related to mercury exposure, and recommend whether there was need for a new health study. The Committee after examining the ex-workers, questioning the [[Hindustan Unilever]] Limited (HUL) officials and after a visit to the factory in October 2007 submitted its report suggesting that there is "no sufficient evidence to link the current clinical condition of the factory workers to the mercury exposure in the factory in the past". Accepting the report, the Madras High Court ruled out the need for any fresh health study. In the meantime, the [[Ministry of Labour and Employment (India)|Ministry of Labour and Employment]], which is also a respondent in the case before the Madras High Court conducted a detailed study by a team comprising experts from various fields found that there is [[prima facie]] evidence to suggest that not only the workers of the factory, but even the children of the workers, have suffered because of exposure to mercury. The Ministry submitted its report to the Madras High Court in 2011. It also recommended setting up a Board to examine the extent of damage or disability suffered by workers and their children because of exposure to mercury, and based on the assessment of the Board workers can approach the Employment Compensation Commissioner to seek compensation. The case before the Madras High Court is still to be decided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unilever|title=Workers Health Issues and Unilever's Stand|url=http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/Respondingtostakeholderconcerns/India/|publisher=Unilever|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jersey's [[List of national legal systems|legal system]] is 'mixed' or '[[Legal pluralism|pluralistic]]', and sources of law are in French and English languages, although since the 1950s the main [[working language]] of the legal system is English.

== Sources of law ==

=== Legislation adopted by the States of Jersey ===
Jersey's legislature, the [[States of Jersey|States Assembly]] makes [[legislation]] affecting most areas of activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |publisher=Institute of Law |title=Study Guide for Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law, chapter 8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228104105/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Laws ====
[[File:1771 onwards Jersey Recueil des Lois.jpg|thumb|''Recueil de Lois de Jersey'' from 1771]]
The highest form of legislation made by the States is 'Laws'. If a proposed Law is likely to be controversial, the general desirability of having new legislation on the topic may be debated before the Law drafted. The procedure for making Laws is set out in the Standing Orders of the States of Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/lawsinforce/consolidated/16/16.800.15_StandingOrdersoftheStatesofJersey_RevisedEdition_1January2011.pdf|title=Standing Orders of the States of Jersey|date=1 January 2011}}; {{cite web|first=Lucy|last=Marsh-Smith|title=The Production of Legislation in the Crown Dependencies|year=2010|publisher=Jersey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb10/JLR1002_Marsh-Smith.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221553/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb10/JLR1002_Marsh-Smith.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the Law is in draft from, it starts the legislative process as a ''projet de loi'', which may be introduced to the States by a [[Cabinet of Jersey|Minister]], any States Member, a [[scrutiny panel]] or the Comité des [[Connétable (Jersey and Guernsey)|Connétables]]. At the stage known as 'first reading', the title of the projet is read out and the projet is 'lodged [[Greffier|au Greffe]]' providing a two to six week breathing space for Members to read the draft Law. Under Article 16 of the Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000,&lt;ref name="HRLaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%5Chtm%5CLawFiles%5C2000%2FJersey_Law_19-2000.htm|title=Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110631/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%5Chtm%5CLawFiles%5C2000%2FJersey_Law_19-2000.htm|archivedate=2013-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Minister or other person lodging the projet au Greffe must make a written statement that the provisions of the projet are compatible with [[ECHR|Convention rights]] or 'make a statement that although [he or she] is unable to make a statement of compatibility, [he or she] nevertheless wants the States to proceed with the projet'. At the next 'second reading' stage, there is a formal debate in the States chamber during which members consider the principle of the projet and then scrutinise the draft in detail. At 'third reading' stage there is an opportunity for minor drafting errors to be corrected. Finally, members vote to adopt the law.

The Law is then submitted via the [[Lieutenant Governor of Jersey|Lieutenant Governor]]'s office for transmission to London, where [[Politics of Jersey#Relations with the United Kingdom|officials]] in the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] examine the Law. In 2010, the [[House of Commons Justice Committee]] was highly critical of the UK Government's approach, finding that 'The Islands are more than adequately advised by their own Law Officers and Parliamentary Counsel. It seems a strange use of Ministry of Justice resources ... to engage in a kind of legislative oversight which does not restrict itself to the constitutional grounds for scrutiny'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=House of Commons Justice Committee|title=Crown Dependencies, 8th Report of 2009-10, HC 56-1, para 62|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/56/5607.htm#a6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process may take several months. In an unusual move in 2011, campaigners against a Law that sought to reduce the number of Senators in the States petitioned the Privy Council to advise the Queen to refuse Royal Assent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save Senators plea reaches Privy Council|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=7 June 2011|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2011/06/07/save-senators-plea-reaches-privy-council/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once official scrutiny is complete in London, the Law is formally presented to Her Majesty for [[Royal Assent]] at a meeting of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], usually held at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle.

After a Law receives Royal Assent, the final step is for it be registered with the [[Royal Court of Jersey]]. At this point it is 'passed'. The Law is then brought into force at a date decided by the relevant Jersey minister. There may be a considerable delay between a Law being passed and it becoming legally effective if, for example, civil servants need to be trained, computer systems put in place or money found to pay for the new scheme.

Laws adopted and passed are published in print as ''Recueil de Lois'' de Jersey and online by the [[Jersey Legal Information Board]] on the Jersey Law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/LawsInForce/default.aspx|title=Laws in Force|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928234724/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/LawsInForce/default.aspx|archivedate=2012-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; website.

==== Other types of legislation ====
In Jersey, there are other types of legislation in addition to Laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Institute of Law | title = Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law | chapter = 8 | publisher = Institute of Law | year = 2011 | location = Jersey | url = http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | accessdate = 2012-03-27 | isbn = 978-1-908716-00-2 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120314235510/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | archivedate = 2012-03-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Regulations''': these are used where a Law delegates to the States Assembly power to make legally binding rules to implement a named Law.
* '''Triennial Regulations''': since the 18th century, the States of Jersey has had power to make provisional regulations of up to three years' duration.
* '''Orders and Rules''': these are generally made by a Minister, within the scope of powers set out in a Law.

=== Customary law ===
Custom is a source of law in the Jersey legal system. It has been described as "the product of generally accepted usage and practice. It has no formal sanction or authority behind it other than the general consensus of opinion within the community".&lt;ref&gt;Snell v Beadle [2001] UKPC 5 at [16] http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/2001/5.html&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from [[English common law]] where rules stated by a judge of a senior court are binding law ''because'' they are stated by a judge. In customary law, the role of the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)|judiciary]] is to look for evidence of what is "generally accepted usage and practice".

Many rules of customary law have crystallised to such an extent (through repeated acknowledgment by the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]] and in the way people conduct their affairs) that everyone accepts them as binding without discussion. The boundaries of the [[Parishes of Jersey|Parishes]], the existence of the office of [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)#Bailiff of Jersey|Bailiff]] and various rules relating to possession of land and inheritance fall into this category. Many rules of customary law are to be found discussed in the texts of the "Commentators" and the case law of the Jersey courts.  Where the works of the commentators do not deal with situation, the Jersey courts look at factual evidence to work out is the "generally accepted usage and practice".&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''Moran v Deputy Registrar for the Parish of St Helier'' [2007] JRC 151 http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnReportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2007/07-08-02_Moran_and_Kemp_and_The_Deputy_Registrar_for_St_Helier_151.htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113055727/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnReportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2007%2F07-08-02_Moran_and_Kemp_and_The_Deputy_Registrar_for_St_Helier_151.htm |date=2012-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The customary law of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] is particularly influential as a source of law in Jersey, even though Jersey ceased to part of Normandy in 1204. Norman law developed in two main epochs–the "Ancienne coutume" (1199–1538) and the "Coutume reformée" (1538–1804).

==== Ancienne coutume of Normandy ====
The northern and western regions of Medieval Europe "were a patchwork of territorial areas in which the main source of law was customs, usages and practices which had become relatively fixed and settled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Institute of Law | title = Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law | chapter = Chapter 2 | publisher = Institute of Law | year = 2011 | location = Jersey | url = http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | accessdate = 2012-03-27 | isbn = 978-1-908716-00-2 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120314235510/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | archivedate = 2012-03-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman law was based on oral tradition and repeated practices in [[Feudal]] society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

When in 1309 [[Edward II of England]] sent Justices to Jersey, the people of Jersey were "asked by what law they claimed to be governed, the law of England, of Normandy, or by some special customs of their own? They answered 'By the law of Normandy, and referred the Justices to the ''Summa of Malcael'' [the Jersey name for the Grand Coutumier], where the Norman laws are well embodied'... But they added, and this a clause that caused much trouble later, 'except that we have certain customs used in this island from time immemorial".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In the 16th century, two commentaries on the Grand Coutumier, written in Normandy, have been influential in Jersey law. [[:fr:Guillaume Le Rouillé|Guillaume Rouillé of Alençon]] (also known as Le Rouillé) was the author of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3-xCAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=intitle%3ALe%20intitle%3AGrant%20intitle%3ACoustumier&amp;pg=PT3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Le Grant Coustumier du pays &amp; duché de Normendie : tres utile &amp; profitable a tous practiciens]'' (1534; 1539). He also produced commentary on the neighbouring province of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] (pictured).

Guillaume Terrien's ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xYaA_5KCB04C&amp;dq=Commentaires%20du%20droit%20civil%20tant%20public%20que%20priv%C3%A9%20observ%C3%A9%20au%20pays%20et%20Duch%C3%A9%20de%20Normandie&amp;pg=PP3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Commentaires du droit civil, tant public que privé, observé au pays et Duché de Normandie]'' was first published in 1574. Dawes explains: "Terrien’s own work comprised the selecting of texts from the ''Grand Coutumier'', putting them into an order which suited his scheme (even to the point of cutting and pasting quite disparate texts) and then commenting on the resulting amalgam. To this commentary a further author added notes headed 'Additio', more often than not in Latin".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Dawes| first =Gordon| authorlink =| title =A note on Guillaume Terrien and his work| journal =Jersey and Guernsey Law Review| volume =| issue =| pages =| publisher =Jersey and Guernsey Law Review Ltd| location =| year =2007| language =| url =http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb07/JLR0702_Dawes.aspx| jstor =| issn =| doi =| id =| mr =| zbl =| jfm =| accessdate =27 August 2011| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120113055355/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb07/JLR0702_Dawes.aspx| archivedate =13 January 2012| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two modern versions of the text of the Grand Coutumier have been produced. The first was by [[Jurat]] William Laurence de Gruchy entitled ''L’Ancienne Coutume de Normandie: Réimpression, éditée avec de légères annotations'' (1881), based on Le Rouillé’s 1539 edition, using a double-column format setting out the Latin and French texts side by side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==== Coutume Reformée of Normandy ====
[[File:Berault_Coutume_Reformée_3rd_edn_1620.jpg|thumb|Berault's 1620 commentary]]
The second period in the development of Norman custom was between 1583 and 1804 and is known as the ''Coutume reformée'' (the reformed custom). In 1453, [[Charles VII of France]] issued orders that all the customary laws of France should be "redacted", in other words set out systematically and approved under royal authority. The [[Duchy of Normandy]] was the last part of France to comply with this order but the new text was eventually prepared and received royal approval in 1585 by [[Henry III of France]].

There are two reasons why the Coutume reformée might be thought to have little relevance to [[Jersey]]: it was created 380 years after Jersey had ceased formally to be part of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] and it was a text sanctioned by the king of France. Nonetheless, Jersey lawyers and courts made frequent references to the Coutume reformée and by virtue of its assimilation into Jersey law over the centuries it is regarded as a source of the island's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Within France, customary law was abolished in 1804 with the introduction of uniform [[Napoleonic code|codes]] of civil and criminal law across the whole of France.

==== Jersey commentators on custom ====
As well as relying on commentaries produced in France, Jersey has an indigenous legal literature on custom. In the 17th century, [[Jean Poingdestre]] (1609–1691) and [[Philippe Le Geyt]] (1635–1716) wrote several works. Some chapters of [[Charles Sydney Le Gros|C.S. Le Gros]]' 20th century work, ''Traité du Droit Coutumier d l'Ile de Jersey'' also remain relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=C.S.|last=Le Gros|title=Traité du Droit Coutumier d l'Ile de Jersey|location=St Helier|publisher=Jersey and Guernsey Law Review Ltd|year=1943|ISBN=978-0-9557611-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legislative reforms of custom ====
Many rules of customary law have been amended or abolished by legislation in the later 19th and 20th centuries. Examples of this include:
* “Any rule of customary law, that a contract passed before the Royal Court for the transfer of immovable property may be annulled, at the instance of the heirs or devisees, as the case may be, of the transferor, if he or she dies within 40 days of the passing of the contract, is abolished” (Customary Law Amendment (No. 2) (Jersey) Law 1984).
* In customary law, the age of majority was 20 years; the Age of Majority (Jersey) Law 1999 reduces this to 18 years.
* “The rule under customary law that all gifts to a concubine are null is hereby abolished” (Wills and Successions (Jersey) Law 1993).
* Customary law did not permit a cause of action for/against a person to survive the person’s death against/for the benefit of the person’s estate; Customary Law Amendment (Jersey) Law 1948 reversed this situation.
* The ''année de jouissance'' (the right of an executor to have the income arising during the administration of a moveable estate for a year and a day) was abolished by the Wills and Successions (Jersey) Law 1993.

=== Influence of English and French law ===
Some fields of Jersey, such as negligence and administrative law, are heavily influenced by [[English common law#Common law|English common law]]. In other branches of law, notably contract, Jersey courts may have regard to [[French civil law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Jersey Law Commission |title=Consultation Paper No. 5: The Jersey Law of Contract |date=October 2002 |url=http://www.lawcomm.gov.je/Contract.htm }}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Institute of Law |title=Study Guide on Jersey Contract Law |url=http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228104105/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human rights ===
The Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000,&lt;ref name="HRLaw"/&gt; based closely on the United Kingdom's [[Human Rights Act 1998]], requires Jersey courts so far as possible to interpret legislation so that it is compatible with rights and freedoms guaranteed by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Jersey public bodies are required to act in conformity with Convention rights.

In January 2012, Jersey introduced laws to recognise same-sex civil partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-16536572 | work=BBC News | title=Jersey recognises civil partnerships | date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language of Jersey law ==
During the 20th century, the main working language of the Jersey legal system changed from French to English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Timothy|last=Hanson|title=The Language of Law: the importance of French|year=2005|publisher=Jersey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june05/JLR0506_Hanson.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221249/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june05/JLR0506_Hanson.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1930s, almost all legislation passed by the States Assembly was in French. Since then, French is used only where new legislation makes amendments to legislation originally drafted in French.&lt;ref&gt;All legislation is available on the [http://www.jerseylaw.je/ Jersey Law] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conveyancing of immoveable property was carried out using contracts drafted in French until October 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Falle|title=The structure of a pro forma Jersey conveyance|year=2004|publisher=Jersey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june04/JLR0406_Falle.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221329/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june04/JLR0406_Falle.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Trotter|title=Commentary on Jersey Conveyance|year=2005|publisher=Jersey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june05/JLR0506_Trotter.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221404/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june05/JLR0506_Trotter.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which contracts were required to be in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Falle|title=At the stroke of a pen …|year=2007|publisher=Jersey and Guernsey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb07/JLR0702_Falle.aspx#page83|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221411/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb07/JLR0702_Falle.aspx#page83|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several French [[Jersey Legal French|words and expressions]] used in Jersey differ from [[Standard French]].

==Precedent and law reporting==
[[File:Tables des Décisions de La Cour Royale de Jersey.jpg|thumb|''Tables de Décisions de la Cour Royal de Jersey'' 1885-1978]] The Jersey legal system does not follow the strict rules of [[binding precedent]] that exist in common law jurisdictions such as [[English law|England and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;''Qatar v Al Thani'' 1999 Jersey Law Reports 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Royal Court]] is not bound by its own previous decisions on a point of law but it will generally follow them unless persuaded that the earlier decision was wrongly decided. A similar approach is taken by the [[Courts of Jersey#Appeal courts|Court of Appeal]]. All Jersey courts are, however, bound by points of law decided by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in previous Jersey appeals to that court.

During the 19th and 20th centuries a series of improvements to the system of writing and reporting judgments was put in place. In 1885, the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]] began to publish the ''Tables des Décisions de la Cour Royal de Jersey''–a subject index to decided cases, prepared by the [[Greffier]].&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Law, Jersey, ''Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law'' (2011), chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, [[Charles Thomas Le Quesne]] [[Queen's Counsel|KC]] returned to Jersey from practice at the [[Barristers in England and Wales|English Bar]] and was appointed [[Lieutenant Bailiff of Jersey|Lieutenant Bailiff]]. Up to this point, the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]]'s judgments were in the French style of ''jugements motivés'',{{French spelling}} written in French by the [[Greffier]] rather than the judge, and expressing the reasons for the court's decision only very briefly. Le Quesne changed the language of judgments to English and adopted the [[common law]] style of judgments, where the judge gives detailed reasons for accepting or rejecting the rival submissions made at trial by [[counsel]].&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General v Weston'' 1979 Jersey Judgments 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1950 and 1984, the Royal Court published its and the Court of Appeal judgments in a series of [[law reports]] known as the ''Jersey Judgments'' (eleven volumes in total). From 1984, judgments have been published a new series of [[law reports]] known as the ''Jersey Law Reports''.&lt;ref&gt;Law Reports International Ltd {{cite web |url=http://www.lawreports.com/jersey.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123022208/http://www.lawreports.com/jersey.htm |archivedate=2012-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Jersey Legal Information Board (JLIB) was set up to promote "accessibility of the written law and legal processes to the public and of an integrated and efficient legal system, through the use of information technology and by other means".&lt;ref&gt;Jersey Legal Information Board (Incorporation) Law 2004 {{cite web |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f16%2f16.335_JerseyLegalInformationBoard%28Incorporation%29Law2004_RevisedEdition_1January2006.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181215/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F16%2F16.335_JerseyLegalInformationBoard%28Incorporation%29Law2004_RevisedEdition_1January2006.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Judgments of the Royal Court and Court of Appeal are published online on [https://web.archive.org/web/20120929022406/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Search/default.aspx?target=uj www.jerseylaw.je], with open access to "unreported" judgments as part of the [[Free Access to Law Movement]].

== Judiciary ==
The head of the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)|judiciary in Jersey]] is the [[Bailiff of Jersey|Bailiff]], who as well as performing the judicial functions of a [[chief justice]] is also the President ([[Speaker (politics)|presiding officer]]) of the [[legislature|States of Jersey]] and has certain civic, ceremonial and executive functions. The Bailiff's functions may be exercised by the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Deputy Bailiffs of Jersey|Deputy Bailiff]].

=== Judicial appointments processes ===
The posts of Bailiff and [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Deputy Bailiffs of Jersey|Deputy Bailiff]] are Crown appointments, formally made by Her Majesty the Queen, on [[Politics of Jersey#The Crown|advice]] of the UK government's [[Secretary of State for Justice]].

[[File:Juges Jour d'la Libéthâtion 2009 a.jpg|thumb|The Bailiff and Jurats outside the Royal Court in 2009]]An appointment process has developed in recent years, without a legislative basis, for vacancies for the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Deputy Bailiffs of Jersey|Deputy Bailiff]], Attorney General for Jersey and Solicitor General for Jersey. This involves advertising for candidates and the preparation of a shortlist by a selection panel consisting of the Bailiff (in the chair), the senior [[Jurat]] and the chairman of the [[Jersey Appointments Commission]]. A process of consultation is then carried out, including the Jurats, the [[States Consultative Panel]] (which includes the [[Chief Minister of Jersey|Chief Minister]]), a number of elected members of the States, senior lawyers (the [[Bâtonnier]], the President of the Law Society, the former President of the [[Law Society of Jersey]] and the President of the [[Chambre des Ecrivains]]), the other Crown Officers and the local [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Commissioners|Commissioner]] of the [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Royal Court]]. All candidates on the shortlist are then interviewed by the selection panel.

This process has not been used for appointment to the office of Bailiff on the basis that "The Secretary of State has accepted that the position of Deputy Bailiff is a training ground for the position of Bailiff, and that, therefore, all things being equal, you would expect to move up, assuming of course that you have performed to everyone's satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evidence of Mr M Birt (Bailiff), public hearing 4 May 2010|page=14|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20Bailiff%20Transcript%2020100504%20WM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal from office===
The Bailiff, Deputy Bailiff and members of the [[Jersey Court of Appeal]] 'hold office during good behaviour'.&lt;ref&gt;In relation to the Court of Appeal: {{cite web|title=Court of Appeal (Jersey) Law 1961|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.245_CourtofAppealLaw1961_RevisedEdition_1January2010.htm#Toc249951726|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221706/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F07%2F07.245_CourtofAppealLaw1961_RevisedEdition_1January2010.htm#Toc249951726|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas senior judges in England and Wales who are appointed by Crown may only be removed from office with the consent of both Houses of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senior Courts Act (previously known as the Supreme Court Act) 1981, section 11(3)|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/54/section/11|publisher=Legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-in-detail/jud-acc-ind/judges-and-parliament|title=Judges and parliament|publisher=Judiciary of England and Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Kingdom [[Secretary of State for Justice]] may dismiss a Jersey judge appointed by the Crown without the agreement [[States of Jersey]].

Jurats hold office up to the age of 72 years. A Jurat who 'in the opinion of the Court, is permanently unable, through physical or mental incapacity, or for any other reason, efficiently to carry out the duties of the office, may be called upon by the Court to resign'. A Jurat who refuses to resign may be removed from office by Order of Her Majesty in Council on the petition of the Superior Number (the Bailiff and five or more Jurats) of the [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Royal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 9 of the Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bailiff may if he 'thinks fit, terminate the appointment of a Commissioner on the ground of incapacity or misbehaviour'.&lt;ref name="RoyalCourtLawII"/&gt;

The Magistrates, who are also appointed by the Bailiff not the Crown, may not be removed from office 'except by virtue of an Order of Her Majesty in Council'.&lt;ref&gt;Article 2(3) of the {{cite web|title=Loi (1864) concernant la charge de Juge d’Instruction|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.525_Loi%281864%29ConcernantLaChargeDeJugeD%2527Instruction_RevisedEdition_1January2012.htm|publisher=JerseyLaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, the Chief Minister informed the [[States of Jersey]] that the Magistrate-Designate, Ian Christmas, has 'agreed not to sit as a judge following a discussion with the former Bailiff as a result of a criminal investigation into an alleged [[fraud]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/AssemblyQuestions/2009/3%20Deputy%20of%20St%20Martin%20to%20CM%20re%20suspension%20of%20Magistrate%20designate.pdf|title=Extract from States of Jersey Hansard|year=2009|publisher=States of Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=States of Jersey|title=Official Report ('Hansard')|date=8 June 2010|url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/Pages/Hansard.aspx?docid=30cbb644c43134fba74ddd68c3b4e9e6_StatesAssembly#_Toc264536235|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111039/http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/Pages/Hansard.aspx?docid=30cbb644c43134fba74ddd68c3b4e9e6_StatesAssembly#_Toc264536235|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|title=Further delay in fraud case|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=15 March 2011|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2011/03/15/further-delay-in-fraud-case/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Christmas was subsequently convicted of one count of fraud and sentenced to fifteen months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/judgments/unreportedjudgments/documents/display.aspx?url=2012%2f12-10-05_AG-v-Lewis_Christmas_Foot_and_Cameron_177.htm|title=Attorney General v Lewis, Christmas, Foot and Cameron (2012) JRC 177|publisher=JerseyLaw|date=5 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110638/http://www.jerseylaw.je/judgments/unreportedjudgments/documents/display.aspx?url=2012%2F12-10-05_AG-v-Lewis_Christmas_Foot_and_Cameron_177.htm|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that the Bailiff's Office has asked the United Kingdom [[Ministry of Justice]] to arrange for a UK judge to undertake a disciplinary investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/news/2012/07/27/what-next-for-fraud-judge/|title=What next for fraud judge?|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/news/2012/09/25/christmas/|title=New inquiry to decide whether Christmas retains his position|date=25 September 2012|publisher=Jersey Evening Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonymusings.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/ian-christmas-legal-background.html|title=Ian Christmas: the Legal Background|publisher=Tony's musings|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial independence in Jersey===

====Code of Conduct====
All judges in Jersey are bound by a [http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/BailiffsChambers/Pages/CodeConduct.aspx code of conduct] promulgated by the [[Jersey Judicial Association]] in 2007. This requires judges to 'uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary and perform their duties with competence, diligence and dedication'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of conduct for members of the judiciary of Jersey, paragraph 1|year=2007|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/BailiffsChambers/Pages/CodeConduct.aspx|publisher=Jersey Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ECHR Article 6====
All courts in Jersey are required under [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] to be 'independent and impartial'.&lt;ref name="HRLaw"/&gt; In 2000, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] held in ''McGonnell v United Kingdom''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/62.html|title=McGonnell v United Kingdom (2000) ECHR 62|publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there was a breach of Article 6 in ''Guernsey'' where the Bailiff or Deputy Bailiff sat as President of the [[States of Guernsey]] when proposed legislation was being debated and then subsequently sat as a judge of the [[Royal Court of Guernsey]] in a case where that legislation was relevant. The Court, noting that there was no suggestion that the Bailiff 'was subjectively biased', stated that the 'mere fact' that this happened was capable of casting doubt on the Bailiff's impartiality. A Bailiff and Deputy Bailiff in Jersey is able to avoid a ''McGonnell'' situation simply by not sitting in the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]] in cases concerned with legislation that was debated when he presided in the [[States of Jersey|States]]. The current Bailiff, Mr [[Michael Birt (Bailiff of Jersey)|Michael Birt]] has conceded that 'we probably need to improve our systems to be very compliant with ''McGonnell'' and that one probably ought to keep a running list of those statutes where I have presided so at least I could invite the parties to consider whether they wanted to object or not'.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 46-47, Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers, Public Hearing 4 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent review chaired by [[Lord Carswell]], set up by the [[States of Jersey]], a legal opinion was commissioned from [[Rabinder Singh (Barrister)|Rabinder Singh]] QC in which he expressed the view that 'there is no reason in law why the present constitutional arrangements in respect of the Bailiff should be altered. However, the trend suggests that the tide of history is in favour of reform and that the legal position will be different in 10 years time'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/Pages/StatesReports.aspx?ReportID=491|title=Report into Review of Crown Officers|publisher=Jersey Government|date=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report of Lord Carswell's inquiry concluded that Mr Singh's opinion 'provides an additional reason why the Bailiff should cease to be the President of the States'.&lt;ref&gt;Para 5.16 of Report into Review of Crown Officers&lt;/ref&gt; The [[States of Jersey]] have not accepted this aspect of the Carswell report. Many prominent islanders do not believe that any change is necessary or desirable.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{cite web|first=Reg|last=Jeune|title=Let's not throw out 800 years of history and good governance|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=20 December 2010|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2010/12/20/lets-not-throw-out-800-years-of-history-and-good-governance/}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/HowGovernmentWorks/ReviewCrownOfficers/Pages/WrittenSubmissions.aspx|title=Written submissions on role of Crown Officers|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stuart Syvret litigation====
In recent years, a former [[States of Jersey|State's]] member Mr [[Stuart Syvret]] has argued in legal proceedings in England and Jersey that all members of [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)|the Jersey judiciary]] lack the appearance of independence and impartiality. In March 2009, the High Court in London refused him permission to commence a judicial review claim against [[Home Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/jersey/7946988.stm |title=Jersey abuse case review rejected |first= |last=Anon|work=[[BBC News]] |date=17 March 2009 |publisher=[[BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=5 September 2011}}; {{cite web |url= http://www.channelonline.tv/channelonline_jerseynews/displayarticle.asp?id=400612 |title=Syvret loses High Court bid |first= |last=Anon |work=channelonline.tv |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jersey, subsequent proceedings related to a criminal prosecution for a data protection offence (he named a former nurse on his [[blog]], who he said was guilty of murdering patients), judicial reviews and appeals relating to that criminal case, and a separate civil action brought by Syvret against fellow politicians and Law Officers in connection with his removal from office as minister for health.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example:&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Nursing a grievance in Jersey|newspaper=Private Eye (no 1288)|date=13 May 2011|page=30}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Jersey senator jailed over data-breach blog|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2010|page=11}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Hemming shields man|newspaper=Birmingham Evening Mail|date=26 October 2009|page=8}} (referring to Liberal Democrat MP [[John Hemming (politician)|John Hemming]]'s assistance to Syvret)&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Hough|title=Jersey senator to claim asylum at Commons|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 October 2009|page=16}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Charge against senator in abuse cover-up claim|newspaper=The Times|date=20 July 2009|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syvret argues that he cannot have a fair trial in the island and there is a lack of appearance of independence and impartiality because judges are appointed by the [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)|Bailiff]] and the other judges have attended social events with the Bailiff. Syvret's arguments relating to lack of independence and impartiality have been rejected by the Royal Court and Court of Appeal in Jersey on a number of occasions between 2009 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Judgment of Sir Richard Tucker (sitting as a Commissioner of the Royal Court) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v Attorney General (2009) JRC 165 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2009/09-08-18_Syvret-v-AG_165.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=18 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224105155/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2009%2F09-08-18_Syvret-v-AG_165.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgement of Clare Montgomery QC (sitting as a judge of the Court of Appeal) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v Attorney General (2009) JCA 181 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2009/09-09-04_Syvret-v-AG_JCA181.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=4 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111432/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2009%2F09-09-04_Syvret-v-AG_JCA181.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgment of Mr Julian Clyde-Smith (sitting as a Commissioner of the Royal Court) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v Attorney General (2010) JRC 179 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2010/10-10-08_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_179.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=6 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111747/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2010%2F10-10-08_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_179.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgment of Jonathan Sumption QC (sitting as a Commissioner of the Royal Court) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v Chief Minister and others (2011) JRC 116 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011/11-06-20_Syvret-v-Chief_Minister_and_Others_116.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=20 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224103945/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011%2F11-06-20_Syvret-v-Chief_Minister_and_Others_116.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgment of MS Jones QC (sitting in the Jersey Court of Appeal) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v HM Attorney General (2011) JCA 130 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011/11-07-05_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_JCA130.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=5 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224095020/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011%2F11-07-05_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_JCA130.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgment of the Court of Appeal (Michael Beloff QC, Clare Montgomery QC and Christopher Nugee QC) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v HM Attorney General (2011) JCA 146 |publisher=JerseyLaw |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011/11-07-28_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_JCA146.htm |date=28 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224112152/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011%2F11-07-28_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_JCA146.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jersey legal profession ==
[[File:Institute of Law, St Helier, Jersey.jpg|thumb|Institute of Law, Seale Street, St Helier|upright]]The Jersey legal profession has three types of Jersey-qualified lawyers - Advocates, Solicitors and [[Public notary#United Kingdom|Notaries Public]].&lt;ref name="1997Law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.070_AdvocatesandSolicitorsLaw1997_RevisedEdition_1January2009.htm#Toc203181030|title=Advocates and Solicitors Law 1997|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221753/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.070_AdvocatesandSolicitorsLaw1997_RevisedEdition_1January2009.htm#Toc203181030|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/6-7/90|title=Public Notaries Act 1843}} (United Kingdom), section 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Advocate#Advocates in the Channel Islands|Advocates]] have rights of audience to represent clients in all courts. Jersey solicitors have no general rights of audience. Notaries have no rights of audience. The Law Society of Jersey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerseylawsociety.je/ Law Society of Jersey ]&lt;/ref&gt; is the professional body responsible for professional conduct. Notaries are regulated by the Faculty Office of the Archbishop of Canterbury through the [[Dean of the Arches]], referred to as the [[Master of the Faculties]], who is normally an English [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facultyoffice.org.uk|title=Faculty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some law firms focus on legal practice relating to Jersey's [[Economy of Jersey#Financial .26 legal services|finance industry]], the largest being: [[Appleby Spurling Hunter|Appleby]]; Bedell Cristin; [[Carey Olsen]]; [[Mourant Ozannes]]; and [[Ogier (law firm)|Ogier]], all of which are regarded as part of the "[[offshore magic circle]]". Smaller firms and sole practitioners also provide a wide range of legal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylawsociety.je/lawfirms.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613012913/http://www.jerseylawsociety.je/lawfirms.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-06-13|title=Law Firms|publisher=Law Society of Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several law firms now have offices in both Jersey and [[Guernsey]] but the legal professions of the two islands are separate, as they are separate from those in England, Wales and Scotland. Most notaries in Jersey are employed by, or are partners in, local firms of Jersey Advocates or Solicitors, although some are in English solicitors firms or practising purely as notaries, independent of the general legal profession. There is a local Jersey Notaries Society.

The Law Officers of the Crown are responsible for criminal prosecution work and for providing legal advice to the Crown, ministers and other members of the Assembly of the [[States of Jersey]]. The Attorney General and his deputy, the Solicitor General, are non-voting members of the States Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/LawOfficers/Pages/index.aspx|title=Law Officers|publisher=Jersey Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of qualifying as a Jersey lawyer is regulated by the Advocates and Solicitors (Jersey) Law 1997&lt;ref name="1997Law"/&gt; and is similar for both advocates and solicitors. Since 2009, candidates for the [[Jersey law]] examinations are required to enrol on the Jersey Law Course run by the Institute of Law, Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/ Institute of Law]&lt;/ref&gt; They are required to take five compulsory papers: (i) Jersey legal system and constitutional Law; (ii) Law of contract and the law relating to security on moveable property and bankruptcy; (iii) testate and intestate succession; law of immoveable property and conveyancing; and civil and criminal procedure. In addition, candidates must take one of three option papers: (i) company law; (ii) trusts law; or (iii) family law.

The admission of lawyers as Notaries in Jersey is governed by an order of the [[Master of the Faculties]]. It is necessary to show that a prospective Notary has been in actual practise in Jersey as a Jersey-qualified Advocate or Solicitor for a period of 5 years and is required to pass an examination in Notarial Practice.

== Law reform ==
The Jersey Law Commission&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawcomm.gov.je/ Jersey Law Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; was established by the [[States of Jersey]] in 1996 to keep Jersey [[Law commission|law under review]] and bring forward proposals for law reform.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8503">'''Maternal to zygotic transition''' ('''MZT''') is the stage in [[embryonic development]] during which development comes under the exclusive control of the [[Zygote|zygotic]] [[genome]]. This requires both [[Zygote|zygotic]] [[genome]] activation (ZGA) and degradation of maternal products. MZT is often thought to be synonymous with midblastula transition (MBT), but these processes are, in fact, distinct.&lt;ref name="baroux"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Baroux C, Autran D, Gillmor CS, etal |title=The Maternal to Zygotic Transition in Animals and Plants |journal=Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol |volume=73 |pages=89–100 |year=2008 |pmid=19204068 |doi=10.1101/sqb.2008.73.053}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the MBT roughly coincides with ZGA in many [[metazoans]],&lt;ref name="tadros"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tadros W, Lipshitz HD|lastauthoramp=yes |title=The maternal to zygotic transition: a play in two acts |journal=Development |volume=136 |pages=3033–42 |year=2009 |pmid=19700615 |doi=10.1242/dev.033183 |issue=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus may share some common regulatory features. For example, both processes are proposed to be regulated by the [[NC ratio|nucleocytoplasmic ratio]].&lt;ref name="newport"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Newport J, Kirschner M|lastauthoramp=yes |title=A major developmental transition in early ''Xenopus'' embryos: I. characterization and timing of cellular changes at the midblastula stage. |journal=Cell |volume=30 |pages=675–86 |year=1982 |pmid=6183003 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(82)90272-0 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pritchard DK, Schubiger G|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Activation of transcription in ''Drosophila'' embryos is a gradual process mediated by the nucleocytoplasmic ratio. |journal=Genes Dev |volume=10 |pages=1131–42 |year=1996 |doi=10.1101/gad.10.9.1131 |pmid=8654928 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; MBT strictly refers to changes in the [[cell cycle]] and [[cell motility]] that occur just prior to [[gastrulation]].&lt;ref name="baroux"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tadros"/&gt; In the early [[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] stages of [[embryogenesis]], rapid divisions occur synchronously and there are no "gap" stages in the [[cell cycle]].&lt;ref name="baroux"/&gt; During these stages, there is also little to no [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[mRNA]] from the [[zygotic]] [[genome]],&lt;ref name="newport"/&gt; but zygotic transcription is not required for MBT to occur.&lt;ref name="baroux"/&gt; Cellular functions during early cleavage are carried out primarily by maternal products – [[protein]]s and [[messenger RNA|mRNAs]] contributed to the egg during [[oogenesis]].

|}
To begin [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[zygotic]] [[genes]], the [[embryo]] must first overcome the [[Gene silencing|silencing]] that has been established. The cause of this [[Gene silencing|silencing]] could be due to several factors: [[chromatin]] [[Histone-Modifying Enzymes|modifications]] leading to repression, lack of adequate [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] [[RNA Polymerase|machinery]], or lack of time in which significant [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] can occur due to the shortened cell cycles.&lt;ref name="schier"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schier AF |title=The Maternal-Zygotic Transition: Death and Birth of RNAs |journal=Science |volume=316 |pages=406–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17446392 |doi=10.1126/science.1140693 |issue=5823 | bibcode = 2007Sci...316..406S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the first method was provided by Newport and Kirschner's experiments showing that [[NC ratio|nucleocytoplasmic ratio]] plays a role in activating [[zygotic]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]].&lt;ref name="newport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newport2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Newport J, Kirschner M|lastauthoramp=yes |title=A major developmental transition in early ''Xenopus'' embryos: II. control of the onset of transcription. |journal=Cell |volume=30 |pages=687–96 |year=1982 |pmid= 7139712 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(82)90273-2|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that a defined amount of repressor is packaged into the egg, and that the exponential amplification of [[DNA]] at each [[cell cycle]] results in titration of the repressor at the appropriate time. Indeed, in ''[[Xenopus]]'' [[embryos]] in which excess [[DNA]] is introduced, [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] begins earlier.&lt;ref name="newport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newport2"/&gt; More recently, evidence has been shown that [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of a subset of genes in [[Drosophila melanogaster|''Drosophila'']] is delayed by one [[cell cycle]] in [[haploid]] [[embryos]].&lt;ref name="lu"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lu X, Li JM, Elemento O, Tavazoie S, Wieschaus EF |title=Coupling of zygotic transcription to mitotic control at the ''Drosophila'' mid-blastula transition. |journal=Development |volume=136 |pages=2101–2110 |year=2009 |pmid= 19465600 |doi=10.1242/dev.034421 |issue=12 |pmc=2685728}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second mechanism of repression has also been addressed experimentally. Prioleau et al. show that by introducing [[TATA binding protein]] (TBP) into ''[[Xenopus]]'' oocytes, the block in transcription can be partially overcome.&lt;ref name="prioleau"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prioleau MN, Huet J, Sentenac A, Mechali M |title=Competition between chromatin and transcription complex assembly regulates gene expression during early development. |journal=Cell |volume=77 |pages=439–49 |year=1994 |pmid=8181062  |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90158-9 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis that shortened [[cell cycle]]s can cause repression of [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] is supported by the observation that [[mitosis]] causes transcription to cease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shermoen AW, O'Farrell PH|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Progression of the cell cycle through mitosis leads to abortion of nascent transcripts. |journal=Cell |volume=67 |pages=303–10 |year=1991 |pmid=1680567 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(91)90182-X |issue=2 |pmc=2755073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clearing of maternal transcripts==

To eliminate the contribution of maternal [[gene]] products to development, maternally-supplied [[Messenger RNA|mRNAs]] must be degraded in the [[embryo]]. Studies in [[Drosophila melanogaster|''Drosophila'']] have shown that sequences in the [[3' UTR]] of maternal transcripts mediate their degradation (reviewed by Tadros and Lipshitz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tadros W, Lipshitz HD|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Setting the stage for development: mRNA translation and stability during ooccyte maturation and egg activation in ''Drosophila'' |journal=Dev Dyn |volume=232 |pages=593–608 |year=2005 |pmid=15704150 |doi=10.1002/dvdy.20297 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) These sequences are recognized by regulatory [[proteins]] that cause destabilization or degradation of the transcripts. Recent studies in both [[zebrafish]] and ''[[Xenopus]]'' have found evidence of a role for [[microRNAs]] in degradation of maternal transcripts. In [[zebrafish]], the [[microRNA]] miR-430 is expressed at the onset of [[zygotic]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and targets several hundred [[mRNA]]s for [[deadenylation]] and degradation. Many of these targets are [[genes]] that are expressed maternally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Giraldez AJ, Mishima Y, Rihel J, Grocock RJ, Van Dongen S, Inoue K, Enright AJ, Schier AF |title=Zebrafish miR-430 promotes deadenylation and clearance of maternal mRNAs. |journal=Science |volume=312 |pages=75–9 |issue=5770 |year=2006 |pmid=16484454 |doi=10.1126/science.1122689|bibcode = 2006Sci...312...75G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''[[Xenopus]]'', the miR-430 [[ortholog]] miR-427 has been shown to target maternal [[mRNA]]s for [[deadenylation]]. Specifically, miR-427 targets include [[cell cycle]] regulators such as [[Cyclin A1]] and [[Cyclin B2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lund E, Liu M, Hartley RS, Sheets MD, Dahlberg JE |title=Deadenylation of maternal mRNAs mediated by miR-427 in ''Xenopus laevis'' embryos. |journal=RNA |volume= 15|pages=2351–63 |pmid=19854872 |year=2009 |doi=10.1261/rna.1882009 |pmc=2779678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ohio State University Jennings Hall.jpg|thumb|Ohio State University Jennings Hall]]

The '''Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI)''' is an institution of higher learning affiliated with the [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mbi.osu.edu/ MBI Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mathinstitutes.org/institutes/ NSF Math Institutes]&lt;/ref&gt; MBI receives major funding from the [[National Science Foundation]]. The institute offers a vigorous program of research and education, and fosters the growth of an international community of researchers in the [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biosciences]].

==History==
Under the leadership of founding director [[Avner Friedman]], MBI opened its doors in September 2002, holding its first workshop, hosting its first visiting researchers, and starting its first cohort of postdocs in that month. MBI holds 10–12 scientific workshops each year, and hosts about 25 postdoctoral and visiting researchers in residence at any given time. Through its collective events and programs, MBI draws over 1000 visits by researchers in the broadly defined area of mathematical biology throughout the year. MBI’s long term planning is overseen by its Directorate and its Board of Trustees, while its scientific activities are overseen by its Directorate and its Scientific Advisory Committee.

==Mission==

The mission of MBI is: 
* To foster innovation in the application of mathematical, statistical, and computational methods in the resolution of significant problems in the biosciences
* To foster the development of new areas in the mathematical sciences motivated by important questions in the biosciences
* To engage mathematical and biological scientists in these pursuits
* To expand the community of scholars in mathematical biosciences through education, training, and support of students and researchers
To support this mission, MBI programs are designed to reinforce and build upon existing research efforts in the mathematical biosciences, and to inspire and accelerate the expansion of the community and its intellectual growth. These include emphasis year programs, current topic workshops, education programs, and research projects. The administrative and governance structure of the MBI are designed to support the mission of the Institute.

==MBI programs==

===Workshops===
MBI organizes Emphasis Semesters consisting of three or four week-long workshops. Emphasis Semesters are organized around selected themes which have included Mathematical Neuroscience, Cancer and Its Environment, and Analysis of Complex Data in Biological Systems. Outside of Emphasis Semesters, Current Topic Workshops focus on emerging topics in the mathematical biosciences. Most of the Institute's programs are conducted on The Ohio State University campus, but MBI also sponsors conferences and workshops at its academic Institute Partners. MBI accepts proposals for future programs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mbi.osu.edu/participate/program-proposal/ Program Proposals]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0635561 2007 NSF Grant Proposal]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postdoctoral fellows===
MBI [[Postdoctoral researcher|postdoctoral fellows]] engage in an integrated program of tutorials, working seminars, workshops, and interactions with their mathematical and bioscience mentors. These activities are geared toward providing the tools to pursue an independent research program with an emphasis on collaborative research in the mathematical biosciences.

===Long-term visitors===
MBI has a program of support for visitors to spend an extended period of time in residence. During their time at the institute, which can range from a few weeks to many months, visitors can focus on their research while benefiting from participation in MBI workshops and seminars and collaborating with others in the MBI community. Visitors also participate in the Visiting Lecturer Program through which they can share their research.

===Early Career Awards===
Early Career Awards are aimed at non-tenured scientists who have continuing employment and who hold a doctorate in any of the mathematical, statistical and computational sciences, or in any of the biological, medical, and related sciences. Award winners are supported to spend a period of time in residence at MBI.

===Education programs===
The MBI Summer Undergraduate Research Program aims to give outstanding undergraduate students the opprtunity to conduct meaningful research in the mathematical biosciences. MBI works with partner institutions to facilitate an eight-week [[Research Experiences for Undergraduates|Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)]], supported by the [[National Science Foundation]]. Students also participate in a mathematical biology bootcamp at MBI and present their completed research at the Undergraduate Capstone Conference.

MBI co-sponsors a rotating annual summer school with the [[National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis|National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS)]] and [[Canadian university scientific research organizations|Centre for Applied Mathematics in Bioscience and Medicine (CAMBAM)]]. The school brings together graduate students in mathetmatics, biology, and related fields to engage in a focused course of study on a current topic in mathematical biology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimbios.org/education/grad_students NIMBioS Graduate Opportunities]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outreach===
Past programs include the workshop for Women Advancing Mathematical Biology, Workshop for Young Researchers in Mathematical Biology, Blackwell Tapia Conference, and the Science Sundays lecture series.

===Institute Partners===
The MBI Institute Partner (IP) program promotes the involvement of the international math biosciences community in MBI programs. Institute Partners receive direct benefits and opportunities enabling them to support, guide and participate in MBI research and education programs.

'''Movement Research''' is a non-profit organization that offers dance classes, workshops, residencies and performance opportunities for artists in [[New York City]]. Its focus is on improvisation, post-modern dance, and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mouvement.net/teteatete/portraits/questions-en-mouvement Portrait of Movement Research in the French magazine Mouvement]&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1978 under the name “The School for Movement Research &amp; Construction” and incorporated in 1980 after its first public performance in 1979. Movement Research organizes performances at the [[Judson Memorial Church]] among other locations around New York City. It has a long tie with Judson Church and [[Judson Dance Theater]] which shares some of the same base of artists.&lt;ref name=newm&gt;{{cite web|title=Movement Research in Residence|url=http://www.newmuseum.org/pages/view/movement-research|work=Rethinking the Imprint of Judson Dance Theater Fifty Years Later September–December 2012|publisher=[[New Museum]]|accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Spring 2018, Movement Research announced they will be occupying 3 spaces in the newly renovated 122 Community Center, making 122CC Movement Research's first permanent home in their 40 year history.

==Initiatives==
Among Movement Research's initiatives are a weekly dance practice at [[Judson Memorial Church]], ''Open Performance'', an open discussion moderated by a Movement Research Artist-in-Residence, ''Studies Project'', a curated series of panels, and performances focused on a variety of issues, and the two-week Movement Research Festival that explores contemporary dance and the issues around it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artforum.com/diary/id=22733 Claudia La Rocco's Art Forum review of "Roll Call" 2009 Movement Research Spring Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gia&gt;{{cite news|last=Kourlas|first=Gia|title=For Movement Research, a Time to Cast a Wide Net Over Disciplines and Countries|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/07/arts/dance/07move.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=2014-04-08|newspaper=New York Times|date=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NotationsCage.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
{{Italics title}}
'''''Notations''''' is a book that was edited and compiled by American [[avant-garde]] [[composer]] [[John Cage]] (1912–1992) with [[Alison Knowles]] and first published in 1969 by Something Else Press.{{Sfn|Cage|Knowles|1969}}{{Sfn|John Cage Collection}} The book is made up of a large collection of [[graphical scores]], [[facsimile]]s of [[holograph]]s, from the [[Foundation for Contemporary Arts|Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts]], with text by 269 [[composer]]s, which are presented in alphabetical order, with each score allotted equal space, and in which the editor has no more authority than the reader in assigning value to the work.{{Sfn|Kostelanetz}} The book includes the manuscript for the Beatles song "The Word" (song lyrics, but no musical notation) from the ''Rubber Soul'' album (1965).

The text of the book was created using chance procedures to determine which of the 269 composers would be asked to write about their work, and how many words each entry was to consist of. These pieces of writing, which contain from one to sixty-four words, are proceeded by paragraph signs. The typesetting was done by Alison Knowles using chance-derived mixtures of typefaces and sizes. There are also comments by Cage and other writers included throughout the book, typeset using similar procedures.

In 2009, Mark Batty Publisher released ''Notations 21''. Inspired by the work of Cage and Knowles, it contained illustrated musical scores from more than 100 composers along with commentary from each composer.

[[File:Steel Joists &amp; Joist Girders.jpg|thumb|Steel joists and Joist Girders being erected.]]
In [[structural engineering]], the '''open web steel [[joist]]''' (OWSJ) is a lightweight [[steel]] [[truss]] consisting, in the standard form, of parallel chords and a triangulated web system, proportioned to span between bearing points.

The main function of an OWSJ is to provide direct support for roof or floor deck and to transfer the load imposed on the deck to the structural frame i.e. [[beam (structure)|beam]] and [[column]].

In order to accurately design an OWSJ, engineers consider the joist span between bearing points, joist spacing, slope, [[live loads]], [[dead loads]], collateral loads, seismic loads, wind uplift, [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] criteria and maximum joist depth allowed. Many steel joist manufacturers supply economical load tables in order to allow designers to select the most efficient joist sizes for their projects.

While OWSJs can be adapted to suit a wide variety of architectural applications, the greatest economy will be realized when utilizing standard details, which may vary from one joist manufacturer to another. Some other shapes, in addition to the parallel top and bottom chord, are single slope, double slope, arch, gable and scissor configurations. These shapes may not be available from all joist manufacturers, and are usually supplied at a premium cost that reflects the complexity required.
[[File:Arch Steel Joists.jpg|thumb|Arch steel joists being erected.]]
The manufacture of OWSJ in North America is overseen by the Steel Joist Institute (SJI). The SJI has worked since 1928 to maintain sound engineering practice throughout the industry. As a non-profit organization of active manufacturers, the Institute cooperates with governmental and business agencies to establish steel joist standards. Continuing research and updating are included in this work.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=44th Edition Standard Specifications for K-Series, LH-Series, DLH-Series Open Web Steel Joists and for Joist Girders|last=|first=|publisher=Steel Joist Institute|year=2015|isbn=|location=Florence, SC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Load tables and specifications are published by the SJI in five categories: K-Series, LH-Series, DLH-Series, CJ-Series, and Joist Girders. Load tables are available in both Allowable Stress Design (ASD) and Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD).

== History ==
The first joist in 1923 was a Warren truss type, with top and bottom chords of round bars and a web formed from a single continuous bent bar.  Various other types were developed, but problems also followed because each manufacturer had their own design and fabrication standards.  Architects, engineers and builders found it difficult to compare rated capacities and to use fully the economies of steel joist construction. 
[[File:Gable Steel Joists.jpg|thumb|Gable steel joists being erected.]]
Members of the industry began to organize the Institute, and in 1928 the first standard specifications were adopted, followed in 1929 by the first load table. The joists covered by these early standards were later identified as open web steel joists, SJ-Series.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== K-Series ==
Open Web Steel Joists, K-Series, were primarily developed to provide structural support for floors and roofs of buildings. They possess multiple advantages and features which have resulted in their wide use and acceptance throughout the United States and other countries.

K-Series Joists are standardized regarding depths, spans, and load-carrying capacities. There are 63 separate designations in the Load Tables, representing joist depths from 10 inches (254&amp;nbsp;mm) through 30 inches (762&amp;nbsp;mm) in 2 inch (51&amp;nbsp;mm) increments and spans through 60 feet (18,288&amp;nbsp;mm). Standard K-Series Joists have a 2 1/2 inch (64&amp;nbsp;mm) end bearing depth so that, regardless of the overall joist depths, the tops of the joists lie in the same plane.  Seat depths deeper than 2 ½” (64&amp;nbsp;mm) can also be specified.

Standard K-Series Joists are designed for simple span uniform loading which results in a parabolic moment diagram for chord forces and a linearly sloped shear diagram for web forces.  When non-uniform and/or concentrated loads are encountered the shear and moment diagrams required may be shaped quite differently and may not be covered by the shear and moment design envelopes of a standard K-Series Joist. When conditions such as this arise, a KCS joist may be a good option.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== KCS Joists ===
[[File:Steel Joists.png|thumb|Common steel joist chord and web configurations.]]
KCS (K-Series Constant Shear) joists are designed in accordance with the Standard Specification for K-Series Joists.

KCS joist chords are designed for a flat positive moment envelope. The moment capacity is constant at all interior panels. All webs are designed for a vertical shear equal to the specified shear capacity and interior webs will be designed for 100% stress reversal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== LH- and DLH-Series ==
Longspan (LH) and Deep Longspan (DLH) Steel Joists are relatively light weight shop-manufactured steel trusses used in the direct support of floor or roof slabs or decks between walls, beams, and main structural members.

The LH- and DLH-Series have been designed for the purpose of extending the use of joists to spans and loads in excess of those covered by Open Web Steel Joists, K-Series.

LH-Series Joists have been standardized in depths from 18 inches (457&amp;nbsp;mm) through 48 inches (1219&amp;nbsp;mm), for spans through 96 feet (29,260&amp;nbsp;mm).

DLH-Series Joists have been standardized in depths from 52 inches (1321&amp;nbsp;mm) through 120 inches (3048&amp;nbsp;mm), for spans up through 240 feet (73,152&amp;nbsp;mm).

Longspan and Deep Longspan Steel Joists can be furnished with either underslung or square ends, with parallel chords or with single or double pitched top chords to provide sufficient slope for roof drainage. Square end joists are primarily intended for bottom chord bearing.

The depth of the bearing seat at the ends of underslung LH- and DLH-Series Joists have been established at 5 inches (127&amp;nbsp;mm) for chord section number 2 through 17. A bearing seat depth of 7 1/2 inches (191&amp;nbsp;mm) has been established for the DLH Series chord section number 18 through 25.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== CJ-Series ==
Open Web Composite Steel Joists, CJ-Series, were developed to provide structural support for floors and roofs which incorporate an overlying concrete slab while also allowing the steel joist and slab to act together as an integral unit after the concrete has adequately cured.

The CJ-Series Joists are capable of supporting larger floor or roof loadings due to the attachment of the concrete slab to the top chord of the composite joist.  Shear connection between the concrete slab and steel joist is typically made by the welding of shear studs through the steel deck to the underlying CJ-Series Composite Steel Joist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Standard Specifications for Composite Steel Joists, CJ-Series|last=|first=|publisher=Steel Joist Institute|year=2010|isbn=|location=Florence, SC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Joist Girders ==
Joist Girders are open web steel trusses used as primary framing members. They are designed as simple spans supporting equally spaced concentrated loads for a floor or roof system. These concentrated loads are considered to act at the panel points of the Joist Girders.

These members have been standardized for depths from 20 inches (508&amp;nbsp;mm) to 120 inches (3048&amp;nbsp;mm), and spans to 120 feet (36,576&amp;nbsp;mm).

The standard depth at the bearing ends has been established at 7 1/2 inches (191&amp;nbsp;mm) for all Joist Girders. Joist Girders are usually attached to the columns by bolting with two 3/4 inch diameter (19&amp;nbsp;mm) A325 bolts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Peace education''' is the process of acquiring the ''values'', the ''knowledge'' and developing the ''attitudes, skills, and behaviors'' to live in harmony with oneself, with others, and with the natural environment.

There are numerous [[United Nations]] declarations on the importance of peace education.&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations''. Chapter 1. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}. [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/ Chapter details]; and Page, James S.

[http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12720/ Further information]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ban Ki Moon]], U.N. Secretary General, has dedicated the [[International Day of Peace]] 2013 to peace education in an effort to refocus minds and financing on the preeminence of peace education as the means to bring about a [[Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World|culture of peace]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/events/peaceday/2013/sgmessage_countdown.shtml Peace Day 2013 Countdown]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other examples include:

* [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Section 26.
* Recommendation Concerning Education for International Understanding, Co-operation and Peace, and Education Relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Section 18.
* [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], Article 29.1(d).
* [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] – [[World Conference on Human Rights]], Part 2, Paragraphs 78–82, which identify peace education as part of [[human rights education]], and which identifies this education as vital for world peace

* Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, Articles 1/4 and B/9.
* A World Fit for Children, Articles 5 and 20
* United Study on Disarmament and Non-proliferation Education, Article 20.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Koichiro Matsuura]], the immediate past Director-General of [[UNESCO]], has written of peace education as being of "fundamental importance to the mission of UNESCO and the United Nations".&lt;ref&gt;Matsuura, Koichiro. (2008) 'Foreword'. In: J.S.Page ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations.'' Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. p.xix.&lt;/ref&gt; Peace education as a right is something which is now increasingly emphasized by peace researchers such as [[Betty Reardon]]&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, Betty. (1997). 'Human Rights as Education for Peace'. In: G.J. Andrepoulos and R.P. Claude (eds.) ''Human Rights Education for the Twenty-First Century.'' (255-261). Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Douglas Roche]].&lt;ref&gt;Roche, Douglas. (1993). ''The Human Right to Peace''. Toronto: Novalis.&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a recent meshing of peace education and [[human rights education]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly. (1993) ''Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (World Conference on Human Rights).'' New York: United Nations. (A/CONF. 157/23 on June 25, 1993). Part 2, Paragraphs 78-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

Ian Harris and John Synott have described peace education as a series of "teaching encounters" that draw from people:&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Ian and Synott, John. (2002) 'Peace Education for a New Century' ''Social Alternatives'' 21(1):3-6&lt;/ref&gt;
*their desire for peace,
*nonviolent alternatives for managing conflict, and
*skills for critical analysis of structural arrangements that produce and legitimize [[social injustice|injustice]] and [[social inequality|inequality]].
[[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]] suggests peace education be thought of as "encouraging a commitment to peace as a settled disposition and enhancing the confidence of the individual as an individual agent of peace; as informing the student on the consequences of war and social injustice; as informing the student on the value of peaceful and just social structures and working to uphold or develop such social structures; as encouraging the student to love the world and to imagine a peaceful future; and as caring for the student and encouraging the student to care for others".&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations''. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. p. 189. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}. [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/ Chapter details]&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the theory or philosophy of peace education has been assumed and not articulated. [[Johan Galtung]] suggested in 1975 that no theory for peace education existed and that there was clearly an urgent need for [[peace and conflict studies|such theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan (1975) ''Essays in Peace Research, Volume 1''. Copenhagen: Eljers. pp. 334-339.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently there have been attempts to establish such a theory. Joachim James Calleja has suggested  that a philosophical basis for peace education might be located in the [[categorical imperative|Kantian notion of duty]].&lt;ref&gt;Calleja, Joachim James (1991) 'A Kantian Epistemology of Education and Peace: An Examination of Concepts and Values'. Unpublishd PhD Thesis. Bradford University.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]] has suggested that a rationale for peace education might be located in virtue ethics, consequentialist ethics, conservative [[political ethics]], aesthetic ethics and the ethics of care.&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations''. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}. [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/ Chapter details]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early decades of the 20th century, "peace education" programs around the world have represented a spectrum of focal themes, including [[anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclearism]], international understanding, environmental responsibility, communication skills, [[nonviolence]], conflict resolution techniques, democracy, human rights awareness, tolerance of diversity, coexistence and [[gender equality]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;See Groff, L., and Smoker, P. (1996). Creating global-local cultures of peace. Peace and Conflict
Studies Journal, 3, (June); Harris, I.M. (1999). Types of peace education. In A. Raviv, L. Oppenheimer, and D. Bar-Tal

Governance (Maputo, Mozambique, 1–4 September 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=January 2011}} have also addressed spiritual dimensions of inner harmony, or synthesized a number of the foregoing issues into programs on world citizenship. While academic discourse on the subject has increasingly recognized the need for a broader, more holistic approach to peace education, a review of field-based projects reveals that three variations of peace education are most common: conflict resolution training, democracy education, and [[human rights education]]. New approaches are emerging and calling into question some of theoretical foundations of the models just mentioned. The most significant of these new approaches focuses on peace education as a process of worldview transformation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Conflict resolution training===
Peace education programs centered on conflict resolution typically focus on the social-behavioural symptoms of conflict, training individuals to resolve inter-personal disputes through techniques of negotiation and (peer) mediation. Learning to manage anger, "fight fair" and improve communication through skills such as listening, turn-taking, identifying needs, and separating facts from emotions, constitute the main elements of these programs. Participants are also encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and to brainstorm together on compromises&lt;ref&gt;See Deutsch, M. (1993). Educating for a peaceful world. American Psychologist, 48, 510-517; Hakvoort, I. and Oppenheimer, L. (1993). Children and adolescents' conceptions of peace, war, and strategies to attain peace: A Dutch case study. Journal of Peace Research, 30, 65-77; Harris, I.M. (1999). Types of peace education. In A. Raviv, L. Oppenheimer, and D. Bar-Tal (Eds.), How Children Understand War and Peace (pp. 299-317). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, approaches of this type aim to "alter beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours...from negative to positive attitudes toward conflict as a basis for preventing violence" (Van Slyck, Stern and Elbedour, 1999, emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;Van Slyck, M.R., Stern, M., and Elbedour, S. (1999). Adolescents' beliefs about their conflict behaviour. In A. Raviv, L. Oppenheimer, and D. Bar-Tal (Eds.), How Children Understand War and Peace (pp. 208-230). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various styles or approaches in conflict resolution training ([[Alternative dispute resolution|ADR]], [[Verbal Aikido]], [[Non-violent communication|NVC]]) that can give the practitioner the means to accept the conflictual situation and orient it towards a peaceful resolution. As one peer mediation coordinator put it: "Conflict is very natural and normal, but you can't go through your entire life beating everybody up—you have to learn different ways to resolve conflict".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, R. Examining barriers to effective peace education reform. Contemporary Education, 71, 19-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democracy education===
Peace education programs centered on democracy education typically focus on the political processes associated with conflict, and postulate that with an increase in democratic participation the likelihood of societies resolving conflict through violence
and war decreases. At the same time, "a democratic society needs the commitment of citizens who accept the inevitability of conflict as well as the necessity for tolerance" (U.S. Department of State, The Culture of Democracy, emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Information Programs. (n.d.). The culture of democracy. Retrieved January 13, 2003, from http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm6.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Thus programs of this kind attempt to foster a conflict-positive orientation in the community by training students to view conflict as a platform for creativity and growth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Approaches of this type train participants in the skills of [[critical thinking]], debate and coalition-building, and promote the values of freedom of speech, individuality, [[toleration|tolerance]] of [[diversity (politics)|diversity]], compromise and [[conscientious objection]]. Their aim is to produce "responsible citizens" who will hold their governments accountable to the standards of peace, primarily through adversarial processes. Activities are structured to have students "assume the role of the citizen that chooses, makes decisions, takes positions, argues positions and respects the opinions of others":&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from CIVITAS BiH, a program of democracy and human rights education in primary, secondary and tertiary schools of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
http://www.civitas.ba/nastavni_planovi/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; skills that a multi-party democracy are
based upon. Based on the assumption that democracy decreases the likelihood of violence and war, it is assumed that these are the same skills necessary for creating a culture of peace.

===Human rights education===
Peace education programs centered on raising [[awareness]] of [[human rights]] typically focus at the level of policies that humanity ought to adopt in order to move closer to a peaceful global community. The aim is to engender a commitment among participants to a vision of structural peace in which all individual members of the human race can exercise their personal freedoms and be legally protected from violence, oppression and indignity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Approaches of this type familiarize participants with the international covenants and declarations of the United Nations system; train students to recognize violations of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]; and promote tolerance, solidarity, autonomy and self-affirmation at the individual and collective levels.&lt;ref&gt;Brabeck, K. (2001). Justification for and implementation of peace education. Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 7, 85-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights education "faces continual elaboration, a significant theory-practice gap and frequent challenge as to its validity".&lt;ref&gt;Swee-Hin Toh. 1997. "Education for Peace: Towards a Millennium of Well-Being". Paper
for the Working Document of the International Conference on Culture of Peace and
Governance (Maputo, Mozambique, 1–4 September 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; In one practitioner's view:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Human rights education does not work in communities fraught with conflict unless it is part of a comprehensive approach... In fact, such education can be counterproductive and lead to greater conflict if people become aware of rights which are not realized. In this respect, human rights education can increase the potential for conflict"''&lt;ref&gt;Parlevliet, M. (n.d.). Quoted in Pitts, D. (2002). Human rights education in diverse, developing nations: A case in point – South Africa. Issues of Democracy, 7 (March). Retrieved January 12, 2003, from http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0302/ijde/pitts1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To prevent these outcomes, many such programs are now being combined with aspects of conflict resolution and democracy education schools of thought, along with training in nonviolent action.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Kester. 2008. Developing peace education programs: Beyond ethnocentrism and violence. Peace Prints, 1(1), 37-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worldview transformation===
Some approaches to peace education start from insights gleaned from psychology which recognize the developmental nature of human psychosocial dispositions. Essentially, while conflict-promoting attitudes and behaviours are characteristic of earlier phases of human development, unity-promoting attitudes and behaviours emerge in later phases of healthy development. H.B. Danesh (2002a, 2002b, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008a, 2008b)&lt;ref&gt;Danesh, H. B. (2006). Towards an integrative theory of peace education. Journal of Peace Education, 3(1), 55–78.

Peace and Conflict Studies, 11(2), 55–84.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes an "Integrative Theory of Peace" in which peace is understood as a psychosocial, political, moral and spiritual reality. Peace education, he says, must focus on the healthy development and maturation of human consciousness through assisting people to examine and transform their worldviews. Worldviews are defined as the subconscious lens (acquired through cultural, family, historical, religious and societal influences) through which people perceive four key issues: 1) the nature of reality, 2) human nature, 3) the purpose of existence, 4) the principles governing appropriate human relationships. Surveying a mass of material, Danesh argues that the majority of people and societies in the world hold conflict-based worldviews, which express themselves in conflicted intrapersonal, interpersonal, intergroup, and international relationships. He subdivides conflict-based worldviews into two main categories which he correlates to phases of human development: the Survival-Based Worldview and the Identity-Based Worldview. It is through the acquisition of a more integrative, Unity-Based Worldview that human capacity to mitigate conflict, create unity in the context of diversity, and establish sustainable cultures of peace, is increased—be it in the home, at school, at work, or in the international community.

===Critical peace education===
Modern forms of peace education relate to new scholarly explorations and applications of techniques used in peace education internationally, in plural communities and with individuals. Critical Peace Education (Bajaj 2008, 2015; Bajaj &amp; Hantzopoulos 2016; Trifonas &amp; Wright 2013) is an emancipatory pursuit that seeks to link education to the goals and foci of social justice disrupting inequality through critical pedagogy (Freire 2003). Critical peace education addresses the critique that peace education is imperial and impository mimicking the 'interventionism' of Western peacebuilding by foregrounding local practices and narratives into peace education (Salomon 2004; MacGinty &amp; Richmond 2007; Golding 2017). The project of critical peace education includes conceiving of education as a space of transformation where students and teachers become change agents that recognise past and present experiences of inequity and bias and where schools become strategic sites for fostering emancipatory change.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, G. (2004). "Comment: what is peace education?" Journal of Peace Education, 1:1, 123-127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mac Ginty, R. &amp; Richmond, O. (2007). "Myth or Reality: Opposing Views on the Liberal Peace and Post-War Reconstruction,", Global Society 21: 491-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golding, D. (2017). "Border Cosmopolitanism in Critical Peace Education,", Journal of Peace Education 14(2): 155-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bajaj, M. (2008). Encyclopedia of Peace Education. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bajaj, M. (2015). 'Pedagogies of Resistance' and critical peace education praxis. Journal of Peace Education 12(2): 154-166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bajaj, M. &amp; Hantzopooulos, M. (Eds) (2016). Introduction: Theory, Research, and Praxis of Peace Education in Peace Education: International Perspectives. New York: Bloomsbury (1-16).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trifonas, P. P. &amp; Wright, B. (2013). "Introduction," in Critical Peace Education: Difficult Dialogues. New York: Springer, (xiii-xx).&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Yogic peace education===
Where Critical Peace Education is emancipatory, seeking to foster full humanity in society for everyone, yogic peace education (Standish &amp; Joyce 2017)&lt;ref&gt;Standish, K. &amp; Joyce, J (2017). (Forthcoming) Yogic Peace Education: Theory and Practice. Jefferson: McFarland and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; in concerned with transforming personal (as opposed to interpersonal, structural or societal/cultural) violence. In yogic peace education, techniques from yogic science are utilised to alter the physical, mental and spiritual instrument of humanity (the self) to address violence that comes from within. Contemporary peace education (similar to all peace education) relate to specific forms of violence (and their transformation) and similar to teaching human rights and conflict resolution in schools critical peace education and yogic peace education are complementary curricula that seek to foster positive peace and decrease violence in society.

== Criticism ==
Toh Swee-Hin (1997) observes that each of the various streams of peace education "inevitably have their own dynamics and 'autonomy' in terms of theory and practice". "Salomon (2002) has described how the challenges, goals, and methods of peace education differ substantially between areas characterized by intractable conflict, interethnic tension, or relative tranquility".&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, G. (2002). "The Nature of Peace Education: Not All Programs Are Created Equal" in G. Salomon and B. Nevo (eds.) Peace education: The concept, principles and practices in the world. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. Quoted in Nelson, Linden L. (2000). "Peace Education from a Psychological Perspective: Contributions of the Peace and Education Working Group of the American Psychological Association Div. 48."&lt;/ref&gt;

Salomon (2002) raises the problem and its consequences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Imagine that medical practitioners would not distinguish between invasive surgery to remove malignant tumors and surgery to correct one's vision. Imagine also that while surgeries are practiced, no research and no evaluation of their differential effectiveness accompany them. The field would be considered neither very serious nor very trustworthy. Luckily enough, such a
state of affairs does not describe the field of medicine, but it comes pretty close to describing the field of peace education. First, too many profoundly different kinds of activities taking place in an exceedingly wide array of contexts are all lumped under the same category label of "peace education" as if they belong together. Second, for whatever reason, the field's scholarship in the form of theorizing, research and program evaluation badly lags behind practice… In the absence of clarity of what peace education really is, or how its different varieties relate to each other, it is unclear how experience with one variant of peace education in one region can usefully inform programs in another region."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Clarke-Habibi (2005), "A general or integrated theory of peace is needed: one that can holistically account for the intrapersonal, inter-personal, inter-group and international dynamics of peace, as well as its main principles and pre-requisites. An essential component of this integrated theory must also be the recognition that a culture of peace can only result from an authentic process of transformation, both individual and collective."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke-Habibi, Sara. (2005) "Transforming Worldviews: The Case of Education for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina". Journal of Transformative Education, Vol. 3 No. 1, pp. 33-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5849">'''Photoevaporation''' denotes the process where energetic radiation ionises gas and causes it to disperse away from the ionising source.  This typically refers to an astrophysical context where [[ultraviolet]] [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] from hot [[star]]s acts on clouds of material such as [[molecular cloud]]s, [[protoplanetary disk]]s, or planetary [[atmosphere]]s.&lt;ref name=mellema&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1998A&amp;A...331..335M|arxiv=astro-ph/9710205|title=Photo-evaporation of clumps in planetary nebulae|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=331|pages=335|author1=Mellema|first1=G.|last2=Raga|first2=A.

==Planets and atmospheres==
A [[planet]] can be stripped of its atmosphere (or parts of the atmosphere) due to high energy [[photon]]s and other [[electromagnetic radiation]]. If a photon interacts with an atmospheric molecule, the molecule is accelerated and its temperature increased. If sufficient energy is provided, the molecule or atom may reach the [[escape velocity]] of the planet and "evaporate" into space. The lower the [[mass number]] of the gas, the higher the velocity obtained by interaction with a photon. Thus [[hydrogen]] is the gas which is most prone to photoevaporation.

==Protoplanetary disks==
[[Image:Sig06-023.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Photoevaporation occurring to a protoplanetary disk due to the presence of a nearby O-type star]]
[[Protoplanetary disk]]s can be dispersed by [[stellar wind]] and heating due to incident electromagnetic radiation. The radiation interacts with matter and thus accelerates it outwards. This effect is only noticeable when there is sufficient radiation strength, such as coming from nearby O and B type stars or when the central [[protostar]] commences [[nuclear fusion]].

The disk is composed of gas and dust. The gas, consisting mostly of light elements such as [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], is mainly affected by the effect, causing the ratio between dust and gas to increase.

Radiation from the central star excites particles in the accretion disk. The irradiation of the disk gives rise to a stability length scale known as the gravitational radius (&lt;math&gt;r_g&lt;/math&gt;). Outside of the gravitational radius, particles can become sufficiently excited to escape
the gravity of the disk, and evaporate. After 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; years, 
the viscous accretion rates fall below the photoevaporation rates at &lt;math&gt;r_g&lt;/math&gt;. 
A gap then opens around &lt;math&gt;r_g&lt;/math&gt;, the inner disk drains onto the central star, 
or spreads to &lt;math&gt;r_g&lt;/math&gt; and evaporates. An inner hole extending to &lt;math&gt;r_g&lt;/math&gt; 
is produced. Once an inner hole forms, the outer disk is very rapidly cleared.

The formula for the gravitational radius of the disk is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2003PASA...20..337L|title=The Gravitational Radius of an Irradiated Disk|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|volume=20|issue=4|pages=337|author1=Liffman|first1=Kurt|year=2003|doi=10.1071/AS03019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
:&lt;math&gt; r_g = \frac{\left(\gamma - 1\right)}{2\gamma}\frac{GM\mu}{k_B T}
\approx 2.15 \frac{\left(M/M_\odot\right)}{\left(T/10^4 \ {\rm K} \right)} \ {\rm AU},\!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of specific heats (= 5/3 for a monatomic gas),   &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; the universal [[gravitational constant]],  &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; the mass of the central star, &lt;math&gt;M_\odot&lt;/math&gt; the mass of the Sun,
&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; the mean weight of the gas, &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; [[Boltzmann constant]],
&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the gas and AU the [[Astronomical Unit]].

Because of this effect, the presence of massive stars in a star-forming region is thought to have a great effect on planet formation from the disk around a [[young stellar object]], though it is not yet clear if this effect decelerates or accelerates it.

A '''planet''' is an [[astronomical body]] [[orbit]]ing a [[star]] or [[Stellar evolution#Stellar remnants|stellar remnant]] that is massive enough to be [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|rounded]] by its own [[gravity]], is not massive enough to cause [[thermonuclear fusion]], and has [[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared its neighbouring region]] of [[planetesimal]]s.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha" name="footnoteA"&gt;This [[Definition of planet|definition]] is drawn from two separate [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] declarations; a formal definition agreed by the IAU in 2006, and an informal working definition established by the IAU in 2001/2003 for objects outside of the Solar System. The official [[2006 definition of planet|2006 definition]] applies only to the Solar System, whereas the 2003 definition applies to planets around other stars. The extrasolar planet issue was deemed too complex to resolve at the 2006 IAU conference.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IAU"&gt;{{cite web |title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes |url=http://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau0603/ |publisher=International Astronomical Union |date=2006 |accessdate=2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSGESP"&gt;{{cite web|date=2001 |title=Working Group on Extrasolar Planets (WGESP) of the International Astronomical Union |work=IAU |url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html |accessdate=2008-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916161707/http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html |archivedate=2006-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''planet'' is ancient, with ties to history, [[astrology]], science, [[mythology]], and religion. Five planets in the [[Solar System]] are visible to the [[naked eye]]. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of [[deity|deities]]. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) officially adopted a resolution [[IAU definition of planet|defining planets]] within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of [[#Planetary-mass objects|planetary mass]] based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain "planets" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], [[3 Juno|Juno]] and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and [[Pluto]] (the first [[trans-Neptunian object]] discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.

The planets were thought by [[Ptolemy]] to orbit [[Earth]] in [[deferent and epicycle]] motions. Although the idea that the [[heliocentrism|planets orbited the Sun]] had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first [[optical telescope|telescopic]] [[observational astronomy|astronomical observations]], performed by [[Galileo Galilei]]. At about the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observational data collected by [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Johannes Kepler]] found the planets' orbits were [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] rather than [[circular orbit|circular]]. As observational tools improved, [[astronomer]]s saw that, like Earth, each of the planets rotated around an axis [[axial tilt|tilted]] with respect to its [[orbital pole]], and some shared such features as [[ice cap]]s and [[season]]s. Since the dawn of the [[Space Age]], close observation by [[space probe]]s has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as [[volcano|volcanism]], [[hurricane]]s, [[tectonics]], and even [[hydrology]].

Planets are generally divided into two main types: large low-density [[giant planet]]s, and smaller rocky [[terrestrial planet|terrestrials]]. There are eight planets in the Solar System.&lt;ref name="IAU"/&gt; In order of increasing distance from the [[Sun]], they are the four terrestrials, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], Earth, and [[Mars]], then the four giant planets, [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]. Six of the planets are orbited by one or more [[natural satellite]]s.

Several thousands of planets around other stars ("[[#Exoplanets|extrasolar planets]]" or "exoplanets") have been discovered in the [[Milky Way]]. As of {{Extrasolar planet counts|asof}}, {{Extrasolar planet counts|planet_count}} known extrasolar planets in {{Extrasolar planet counts|system_count}} [[planetary systems]] (including {{Extrasolar planet counts|multiplanetsystem_count}} [[List of multiplanetary systems|multiple planetary systems]]), ranging in size from [[Kepler-37b|just above the size of the Moon]] to [[gas giant]]s [[WASP-17b|about twice as large as Jupiter]] have been discovered, out of which more than 100 planets are the same [[Earth radius|size as Earth]], nine of which are at the same [[astronomical unit|relative distance]] from their star as Earth from the Sun, i.e. in the [[circumstellar habitable zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/05/10/kepler-finds-new-planets/84187098/|title=NASA discovery doubles the number of known planets|date=10 May 2016|work=[[USA TODAY]] |access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |work=[[The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php |last=Schneider |first=Jean |date=16 January 2013 |access-date=2013-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 2011, the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler Space Telescope]] team reported the discovery of the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets, [[Kepler-20e]]&lt;ref name="Kepler20e-20111220"&gt;{{cite web |author=NASA Staff |author-link=NASA |title=Kepler: A Search For Habitable Planets – Kepler-20e |url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/discoveries/kepler20e/ |date=20 December 2011 |publisher=[[NASA]] |access-date=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kepler-20f]],&lt;ref name="Kepler20f-20111220"&gt;{{cite web |author=NASA Staff |author-link=NASA |title=Kepler: A Search For Habitable Planets – Kepler-20f |url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/discoveries/kepler20f/ |date=20 December 2011 |publisher=[[NASA]] |access-date=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; orbiting a [[Solar analog|Sun-like star]], [[Kepler-20]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20111220"&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson |first=Michele |title=NASA Discovers First Earth-size Planets Beyond Our Solar System|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/kepler-20-system.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|date=20 December 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature-20111220"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hand |first=Eric |title=Kepler discovers first Earth-sized exoplanets |doi=10.1038/nature.2011.9688 |date=20 December 2011 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20111220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |title=Two Earth-Size Planets Are Discovered |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/science/space/nasas-kepler-spacecraft-discovers-2-earth-size-planets.html|date=20 December 2011 |publisher=New York Times |access-date=2011-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study, analyzing [[gravitational microlensing]] data, estimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=4 |last1=Cassan |first1=Arnaud |author2=D.

The idea of planets has evolved over its history, from the divine lights of antiquity to the earthly objects of the scientific age. The concept has expanded to include worlds not only in the Solar System, but in hundreds of other extrasolar systems. The ambiguities inherent in defining planets have led to much scientific controversy.

The five [[classical planet]]s, being visible to the naked eye, have been known since ancient times and have had a significant impact on [[mythology]], [[religious cosmology]], and ancient [[astronomy]]. In ancient times, astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky, as opposed to the "[[fixed stars]]", which maintained a constant relative position in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Greek Astronomy and Cosmology|publisher=[[The Library of Congress]]|url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/finding-our-place-in-the-cosmos-with-carl-sagan/articles-and-essays/modeling-the-cosmos/ancient-greek-astronomy-and-cosmology|accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greeks called these lights {{lang|grc|[[wikt:πλάνης|πλάνητες]] [[wikt:ἀστήρ|ἀστέρες]]}} ({{Transl|grc|''planētes asteres''}}, "wandering stars") or simply {{lang|grc|[[wikt:πλανήτης#Ancient Greek|πλανῆται]]}} ({{Transl|grc|''planētai''}}, "wanderers"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dplanh%2Fths πλανήτης], H.

The first civilization known to have a functional theory of the planets were the [[Babylonia]]ns, who lived in [[Mesopotamia]] in the first and second millennia BC. The oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the Babylonian [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]], a 7th-century BC copy of a list of observations of the motions of the planet Venus, that probably dates as early as the second millennium BC.&lt;ref name="practice" /&gt; The [[MUL.APIN]] is a pair of [[cuneiform]] tablets dating from the 7th century BC that lays out the motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets over the course of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Francesca Rochberg|chapter=Astronomy and Calendars in Ancient Mesopotamia|title= Civilizations of the Ancient Near East|volume= III|editor=Jack Sasson|date=2000|page=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Babylonian astrology|Babylonian astrologers]] also laid the foundations of what would eventually become [[Western astrology]].&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Holden |first=James Herschel |title=A History of Horoscopic Astrology |date=1996 |publisher=AFA |isbn=978-0-86690-463-6 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Enuma anu enlil]]'', written during the [[Neo-Assyrian]] period in the 7th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | volume=8 |series=State Archives of Assyria |title=Astrological reports to Assyrian kings |editor=Hermann Hunger |date=1992 |publisher=Helsinki University Press |isbn=951-570-130-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprises a list of [[omen]]s and their relationships with various celestial phenomena including the motions of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Babylonian Planetary Omens.

The ancient Greeks initially did not attach as much significance to the planets as the Babylonians. The [[Pythagoreans]], in the 6th and 5th centuries BC appear to have developed their own independent planetary theory, which consisted of the Earth, Sun, Moon, and planets revolving around a "Central Fire" at the center of the Universe. [[Pythagoras]] or [[Parmenides]] is said to have been the first to identify the evening star ([[Hesperos]]) and morning star ([[Phosphoros]]) as one and the same ([[Aphrodite]], Greek corresponding to Latin [[Venus]]),&lt;ref name="burnet"&gt;{{cite book | first=John |last=Burnet |title= Greek philosophy: Thales to Plato |date=1950 |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |pages=7–11 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7yUAmmqHHEgC&amp;pg=PR4 |accessdate=2008-02-07 |isbn=978-1-4067-6601-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this had long been known by the Babylonians. In the 3rd century BC, [[Aristarchus of Samos]] proposed a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] system, according to which Earth and the planets revolved around the Sun. The geocentric system remained dominant until the [[Scientific Revolution]]. 

By the 1st century BC, during the [[Hellenistic period]], the Greeks had begun to develop their own mathematical schemes for predicting the positions of the planets. These schemes, which were based on geometry rather than the arithmetic of the Babylonians, would eventually eclipse the Babylonians' theories in complexity and comprehensiveness, and account for most of the astronomical movements observed from Earth with the naked eye. These theories would reach their fullest expression in the ''[[Almagest]]'' written by [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century CE. So complete was the domination of Ptolemy's model that it superseded all previous works on astronomy and remained the definitive astronomical text in the Western world for 13 centuries.&lt;ref name="practice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="almagest" /&gt; To the Greeks and Romans there were seven known planets, each presumed to be [[Geocentric model|circling Earth]] according to the complex laws laid out by Ptolemy. They were, in increasing order from Earth (in Ptolemy's order and using modern names): the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50180718?query_type=word&amp;queryword=planet |publisher = Oxford English Dictionary | title = planet, n | accessdate=2008-02-07|date=2007}} ''Note: select the Etymology tab ''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="almagest"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bernard R. |last=Goldstein |title=Saving the phenomena: the background to Ptolemy's planetary theory | journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |volume=28 |issue=1 |date=1997 |pages=1–12 |location=Cambridge (UK) |bibcode=1997JHA....28....1G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ptolemy's Almagest |author1= Ptolemy |authorlink=Ptolemy |author2=Toomer, G.

[[Cicero]], in his ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'', enumerated the planets known during the 1st century BCE using the names for them in use at the time:&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/cicero-on-the-nature-of-the-gods De Natura Deorum].&lt;/ref&gt;
:"But there is most matter for wonder in the movements of the five stars which are falsely called wandering; falsely, because nothing wanders which through all eternity preserves its forward and retrograde courses, and its other movements, constant and unaltered. ... For instance, the star which is farthest from the earth, which is known as the star of Saturn, and is called by the Greeks Φαέθων ([[Phainon]]), accomplishes its course in about thirty years, and though in that course it does much that is wonderful, first preceding the sun, and then falling off in speed, becoming invisible at the hour of evening, and returning to view in the morning, it never through the unending ages of time makes any variation, but performs the same movements at the same times. Beneath it, and nearer to the earth, moves the planet of Jupiter, which is called in Greek Φαέθων ([[Phaethon]]); it completes the same round of the twelve signs in twelve years, and performs in its course the same variations as the planet of Saturn. The circle next below it is held by Πυρόεις ([[Pyroeis]]), which is called the planet of Mars, and traverses the same round as the two planets above it in four and twenty months, all but, I think, six days. Beneath this is the planet of Mercury, which is called by the Greeks Στίλβων ([[Stilbon]]); it traverses the round of the zodiac in about the time of the year’s revolution, and never withdraws more than one sign’s distance from the sun, moving at one time in advance of it, and at another in its rear. The lowest of the five wandering stars, and the one nearest the earth, is the planet of Venus, which is called Φωσϕόρος ([[Phosphoros]]) in Greek, and [[Lucifer]] in Latin, when it is preceding the sun, but Ἕσπερος ([[Hesperos]]) when it is following it; it completes its course in a year, traversing the zodiac both latitudinally and longitudinally, as is also done by the planets above it, and on whichever side of the sun it is, it never departs more than two signs’ distance from it."

=== India ===
{{Main|Indian astronomy|Hindu cosmology}}

In 499 CE, the Indian astronomer [[Aryabhata]] propounded a planetary model that explicitly incorporated [[Earth's rotation]] about its axis, which he explains as the cause of what appears to be an apparent westward motion of the stars. He also believed that the orbits of planets are [[Ellipse|elliptical]].&lt;ref&gt;J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson, [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Aryabhata_I.html Aryabhata the Elder], [[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
Aryabhata's followers were particularly strong in [[South India]], where his principles of the diurnal rotation of Earth, among others, were followed and a number of secondary works were based on them.&lt;ref&gt;[[K. V. Sarma|Sarma, K. V.]] (1997) "Astronomy in India" in [[Helaine Selin|Selin, Helaine]] (editor) ''Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|0-7923-4066-3}}, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1500, [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]], in his ''[[Tantrasangraha]]'', revised Aryabhata's model.&lt;ref name="MOPM"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Model of planetary motion in the works of Kerala astronomers |last=Ramasubramanian |first=K. |journal=Bulletin of the Astronomical Society of India |volume=26 |pages=11–31 [23–4] |date=1998 |bibcode=1998BASI...26...11R}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Aryabhatiyabhasya'', a commentary on Aryabhata's ''Aryabhatiya'', he developed a planetary model where Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits Earth, similar to the [[Tychonic system]] later proposed by [[Tycho Brahe]] in the late 16th century. Most astronomers of the Kerala school who followed him accepted his planetary model.&lt;ref name="MOPM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramasubramanian etc. (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of the [[Scientific Revolution]], use of the term "planet" changed from something that moved across the sky (in relation to the [[Fixed stars|star field]]); to a body that orbited Earth (or that was believed to do so at the time); and by the 18th&lt;!--in the 16th &amp; 17th c. there were many other planets--&gt; century to something that directly orbited the Sun when the [[heliocentric model]] of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] gained sway.

Thus, Earth became included in the list of planets,&lt;ref name="galileo_project" /&gt; whereas the Sun and Moon were excluded. At first, when the first satellites of Jupiter and Saturn were discovered in the 17th century, the terms "planet" and "satellite" were used interchangeably – although the latter would gradually become more prevalent in the following century.&lt;ref&gt;See primary citations in [[Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons#References|Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons]]&lt;/ref&gt; Until the mid-19th century, the number of "planets" rose rapidly because any newly discovered object directly orbiting the Sun was listed as a planet by the scientific community.

In the 19th century astronomers began to realize that recently discovered bodies that had been classified as planets for almost half a century (such as [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], [[3 Juno|Juno]], and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]) were very different from the traditional ones. These bodies shared the same region of space between Mars and Jupiter (the [[asteroid belt]]), and had a much smaller mass; as a result they were reclassified as "[[asteroid]]s". In the absence of any formal definition, a "planet" came to be understood as any "large" body that orbited the Sun. Because there was a dramatic size gap between the asteroids and the planets, and the spate of new discoveries seemed to have ended after the discovery of Neptune in 1846, there was no apparent need to have a formal definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hilton |first =James L. |date = 2001-09-17 |url =http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/minorplanets.php |title =When Did the Asteroids Become Minor Planets? |publisher =U.S. Naval Observatory |accessdate = 2007-04-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070921162818/http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/minorplanets.php |archivedate = 2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, [[Pluto]] was discovered.

Further monitoring found the body was actually much smaller: in 1936, [[Raymond Arthur Lyttleton|Ray Lyttleton]] suggested that Pluto may be an escaped satellite of [[Neptune]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lyttleton |first=Raymond A. |date=1936 |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=108–115 |title= On the possible results of an encounter of Pluto with the Neptunian system |bibcode=1936MNRAS..97..108L |doi=10.1093/mnras/97.2.108}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fred Lawrence Whipple|Fred Whipple]] suggested in 1964 that Pluto may be a comet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=52 |pages=565–594 |last=Whipple |first=Fred |date=1964 |bibcode=1964PNAS...52..565W |title= The History of the Solar System |doi= 10.1073/pnas.52.2.565 | pmid=16591209 | issue=2 | pmc=300311}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was still larger than all known asteroids and seemingly did not exist within a larger population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Scientific American |date=1996 |pages=46–52 |last1=Luu |first1=Jane X. |author2=Jewitt, David C. |title=The Kuiper Belt |volume=274 |issue=5 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0596-46|bibcode = 1996SciAm.274e..46L }}&lt;/ref&gt; it kept its status until 2006.

In 1992, astronomers [[Aleksander Wolszczan]] and [[Dale Frail]] announced the discovery of planets around a [[pulsar]], [[PSR B1257+12]].&lt;ref name="Wolszczan" /&gt; This discovery is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of a planetary system around another star. Then, on October 6, 1995, [[Michel Mayor]] and [[Didier Queloz]] of the [[Geneva Observatory]] announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting an ordinary [[main sequence|main-sequence]] star ([[51 Pegasi]]).&lt;ref name="Mayor"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mayor |first1=Michel |author2=Queloz, Didier | title=A Jupiter-mass companion to a solar-type star | journal=Nature | date=1995 | volume=378 | issue=6356 | pages=355–359 | doi= 10.1038/378355a0 | bibcode=1995Natur.378..355M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of extrasolar planets led to another ambiguity in defining a planet: the point at which a planet becomes a star. Many known extrasolar planets are many times the mass of Jupiter, approaching that of stellar objects known as [[brown dwarf]]s. Brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due to their ability to fuse [[deuterium]], a heavier isotope of [[hydrogen]]. Although objects more massive than 75 times that of Jupiter fuse hydrogen, objects of only 13 Jupiter masses can fuse deuterium. Deuterium is quite rare, and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their discovery, making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Basri |first=Gibor |title= Observations of Brown Dwarfs |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |date=2000 |volume=38 | issue=1 |pages=485–519 |doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.38.1.485 |bibcode=2000ARA&amp;A..38..485B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===

With the discovery during the latter half of the 20th century of more objects within the Solar System and large objects around other stars, disputes arose over what should constitute a planet. There were particular disagreements over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a [[asteroid belt|belt]], or if it was large enough to generate energy by the [[thermonuclear fusion]] of [[deuterium]].

A growing number of astronomers argued for Pluto to be declassified as a planet, because many similar objects approaching its size had been found in the same region of the Solar System (the [[Kuiper belt]]) during the 1990s and early 2000s. Pluto was found to be just one small body in a population of thousands.

Some of them, such as [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]], [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], were heralded in the popular press as the [[tenth planet]], failing to receive widespread scientific recognition. The announcement of Eris in 2005, an object then thought of as 27% more massive than Pluto, created the necessity and public desire for an official definition of a planet.

Acknowledging the problem, the IAU set about creating the [[IAU definition of planet|definition of planet]], and produced one in August 2006. The number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had [[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared their orbit]] (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), and a new class of [[dwarf planet]]s was created, initially containing three objects ([[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[Pluto]] and Eris).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Green |first=D.

==== Extrasolar planets ====

There is no official definition of [[extrasolar planet]]s.  In 2003, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) Working Group on Extrasolar Planets issued a position statement, but this position statement was never proposed as an official IAU resolution and was never voted on by IAU members.  The positions statement incorporates the following guidelines, mostly focused upon the boundary between planets and brown dwarfs:&lt;ref name="WSGESP" /&gt;
# Objects with [[true mass]]es below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (currently calculated to be 13 times the mass of Jupiter for objects with the same [[natural abundance|isotopic abundance]] as the Sun&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Saumon |first1=D. |display-authors=4 |author2=Hubbard, W. B. |author3=Burrows, A. |author4=Guillot, T. |author5=Lunine, J. I. |author6=Chabrier, G. |title=A Theory of Extrasolar Giant Planets |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=1996 |volume=460 |pages=993–1018 |bibcode=1996ApJ...460..993S |doi=10.1086/177027|arxiv = astro-ph/9510046 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) that orbit stars or stellar remnants are "planets" (no matter how they formed). The minimum mass and size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in the Solar System.
# Substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are "[[brown dwarf]]s", no matter how they formed or where they are located.
# Free-floating objects in young [[star cluster]]s with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not "planets", but are "sub-brown dwarfs" (or whatever name is most appropriate).

This working definition has since been widely used by astronomers when publishing discoveries of exoplanets in [[academic journal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the list of references for: {{cite web | author=Butler, R. P.  | display-authors=etal |date=2006 |url=http://exoplanets.org/ |title=Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets |publisher =University of California and the Carnegie Institution |accessdate = 2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although temporary, it remains an effective working definition until a more permanent one is formally adopted. It does not address the dispute over the lower mass limit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/outerplanets-04b.html |title=Gravity Rules: The Nature and Meaning of Planethood |last=Stern |first=S. Alan |date=2004-03-22 |publisher=SpaceDaily |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so it steered clear of the controversy regarding objects within the Solar System. This definition also makes no comment on the planetary status of objects orbiting brown dwarfs, such as [[2M1207b]].

One definition of a [[sub-brown dwarf]] is a planet-mass object that formed through [[cloud collapse]] rather than [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]]. This formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon; astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet as part of its division in classification.&lt;ref name="Cha110913"&gt;{{cite web
 |date=2005-11-29

 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/spitzerf-20051129.html
 |accessdate=2006-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine the formation process. For example, a planet formed by [[accretion disc|accretion]] around a star may get ejected from the system to become free-floating, and likewise a sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star.

The 13 Jupiter-mass cutoff represents an average mass rather than a precise threshold value. Large objects will fuse most of their deuterium and smaller ones will fuse only a little, and the 13 {{Jupiter mass}} value is somewhere in between. In fact, calculations show that an object fuses 50% of its initial deuterium content when the total mass ranges between 12 and 14 {{Jupiter mass}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bodenheimer|first1=Peter|last2=D'Angelo|first2=Gennaro|last3=Lissauer|first3=Jack J.|last4=Fortney|first4=Jonathan J.|last5=Saumon|first5=Didier|title=Deuterium Burning in Massive Giant Planets and Low-mass Brown Dwarfs Formed by Core-nucleated Accretion|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=20 June 2013|volume=770|issue=2|pages=120|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/770/2/120|arxiv = 1305.0980 |bibcode = 2013ApJ...770..120B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of deuterium fused depends not only on mass but also on the composition of the object, on the amount of [[helium]] and [[deuterium]] present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1008.5150 |author1=Spiegel |author2=Adam Burrows |author3=Milsom |title=The Deuterium-Burning Mass Limit for Brown Dwarfs and Giant Planets |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=727 |pages=57 |date=2010|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/727/1/57 |bibcode=2011ApJ...727...57S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] includes objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, saying, "The fact that there is no special feature around 13 {{Jupiter mass}} in the observed mass spectrum reinforces the choice to forget this mass limit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneider |first1=J. |display-authors=4 |last2=Dedieu |first2=C. |last3=Le Sidaner |first3=P. |last4=Savalle |first4=R. |last5=Zolotukhin |first5=I. |title=Defining and cataloging exoplanets: The exoplanet.eu database|date=2011|volume=532|issue=79|journal=[[Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics]] |arxiv=1106.0586|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201116713|pages=A79|bibcode=2011A&amp;A...532A..79S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Exoplanet Data Explorer]] includes objects up to 24 Jupiter masses with the advisory: "The 13 Jupiter-mass distinction by the IAU Working Group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores, and observationally problematic due to the sin i ambiguity."&lt;ref name=eod&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1012.5676v1|last1=Wright |first1=J.

Another criterion for separating planets and brown dwarfs, rather than deuterium fusion, formation process or location, is whether the core [[pressure]] is dominated by [[Lateral earth pressure#Coulomb theory|coulomb pressure]] or [[electron degeneracy pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.34.031405.125058 |journal=Annu.

==== 2006 IAU definition of planet ====
{{Main|IAU definition of planet}}
[[File:Euler diagram of solar system bodies.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|[[Euler diagram]] showing the types of bodies in the Solar System.]]

The matter of the lower limit was addressed during the 2006 meeting of the [[International Astronomical Union#The XXVIth General Assembly and the definition of a planet|IAU's General Assembly]]. After much debate and one failed proposal, a large majority of those remaining at the meeting voted to pass a resolution. The 2006 resolution defines planets within the Solar System as follows:&lt;ref name="IAU"/&gt;

{{quotation|A "planet" [1] is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] (nearly round) shape, and (c) has [[clearing the neighbourhood|cleared the neighbourhood]] around its orbit.&lt;br /&gt;
[1] The eight planets are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
}}

Under this definition, the Solar System is considered to have eight planets. Bodies that fulfill the first two conditions but not the third (such as Ceres, Pluto, and Eris) are classified as [[dwarf planet]]s, provided they are not also [[natural satellite]]s of other planets. Originally an IAU committee had proposed a definition that would have included a much larger number of planets as it did not include (c) as a criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4795755.stm |title=Planets plan boosts tally 12 |publisher=BBC |date=2006-08-16 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |first=Paul |last=Rincon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After much discussion, it was decided via a vote that those bodies should instead be classified as dwarf planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/5282440.stm |publisher=BBC |title=Pluto loses status as a planet |date=2006-08-24 |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition is based in theories of planetary formation, in which planetary embryos initially clear their orbital neighborhood of other smaller objects. As described by astronomer [[Steven Soter]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Soter |first = Steven |title = What is a Planet |journal = Astronomical Journal |volume = 132 |issue = 6 |pages = 2513–19 |date = 2006 |doi=10.1086/508861 |arxiv=astro-ph/0608359 |bibcode=2006AJ....132.2513S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The end product of secondary disk accretion is a small number of relatively large bodies (planets) in either non-intersecting or resonant orbits, which prevent collisions between them. Minor planets and comets, including KBOs [Kuiper belt objects], differ from planets in that they can collide with each other and with planets."

The 2006 IAU definition presents some challenges for exoplanets because the language is specific to the Solar System and because the criteria of roundness and orbital zone clearance are not presently observable.  Astronomer [[Jean-Luc Margot]] proposed a mathematical criterion that determines whether an object can clear its orbit during the lifetime of its host star, based on the mass of the planet, its semimajor axis, and the mass of its host star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/11/151110134519.htm|title=Simpler way to define what makes a planet|date=2015-11-10|publisher=Science Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why we need a new definition of the word 'planet'|url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-new-planet-definition-margot-20151113-htmlstory.html|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This formula produces a value &lt;big&gt;π&lt;/big&gt; that is greater than 1 for planets.  The eight known planets and all known exoplanets have &lt;big&gt;π&lt;/big&gt; values above 100, while Ceres, Pluto, and Eris have &lt;big&gt;π&lt;/big&gt; values of 0.1 or less.  Objects with &lt;big&gt;π&lt;/big&gt; values of 1 or more are also expected to be approximately spherical, so that objects that fulfill the orbital zone clearance requirement automatically fulfill the roundness requirement.&lt;ref name=Margot&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015|title=A Quantitative Criterion For Defining Planets|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=150|issue=6|pages=185|author=Jean-Luc Margot |arxiv=1507.06300|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/150/6/185|bibcode=2015AJ....150..185M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology and naming ==
{{see also|Weekday names|Naked-eye planet}}
[[File:Olympians.jpg|thumb|upright|The Greek gods of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], after whom the [[Solar System]]'s  Roman names of the planets are derived]]

The names for the planets in the Western world are derived from the naming practices of the Romans, which ultimately derive from those of the Greeks and the Babylonians. In [[ancient Greece]], the two great luminaries the Sun and the Moon were called ''[[Helios]]'' and ''[[Selene]]''; the farthest planet (Saturn) was called ''[[Phaenon|Phainon]]'', the shiner; followed by ''[[Phaethon]]'' (Jupiter), "bright"; the red planet (Mars) was known as ''[[Pyroeis]]'', the "fiery"; the brightest (Venus) was known as ''[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphoros]]'', the light bringer; and the fleeting final planet (Mercury) was called ''[[Stilbon (mythology)|Stilbon]]'', the gleamer. The Greeks also made each planet sacred to one among their pantheon of gods, the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]]: Helios and Selene were the names of both planets and gods; Phainon was sacred to [[Cronus]], the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who fathered the Olympians; Phaethon was sacred to [[Zeus]], Cronus's son who deposed him as king; Pyroeis was given to [[Ares]], son of Zeus and god of war; Phosphoros was ruled by [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love; and [[Hermes]], messenger of the gods and god of learning and wit, ruled over Stilbon.&lt;ref name="practice"&gt;{{cite book |title=The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy |first=James |last=Evans |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1998 |pages=296–7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nS51_7qbEWsC&amp;pg=PA17
|accessdate=2008-02-04 |isbn=978-0-19-509539-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek practice of grafting of their gods' names onto the planets was almost certainly borrowed from the Babylonians. The Babylonians named [[Hesperus#Variant names|Phosphoros]] after their goddess of love, ''[[Ishtar]]''; Pyroeis after their god of war, ''[[Nergal]]'', Stilbon after their god of wisdom [[Nabu]], and Phaethon after their chief god, ''[[Marduk]]''.&lt;ref name="nergal"&gt;{{cite web |first=Kelley L. |last=Ross |date=2005 |title=The Days of the Week |url=http://www.friesian.com/week.htm |publisher=The Friesian School |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are too many concordances between Greek and Babylonian naming conventions for them to have arisen separately.&lt;ref name="practice" /&gt; The translation was not perfect. For instance, the Babylonian Nergal was a god of war, and thus the Greeks identified him with Ares. Unlike Ares, Nergal was also god of pestilence and the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Martian Metamorphoses: The Planet Mars in Ancient Myth and Tradition |first=Ev |last=Cochrane |date=1997 |publisher=Aeon Press |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jz3eqRGuM0wC&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=ares+nergal+planet+pestilence |accessdate=2008-02-07 |isbn=0-9656229-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, most people in the western world know the planets by names derived from the Olympian pantheon of gods. Although modern Greeks still use their ancient names for the planets, other European languages, because of the influence of the [[Roman Empire]] and, later, the [[Catholic Church]], use the Roman (Latin) names rather than the Greek ones. The Romans, who, like the Greeks, were [[Indo-European mythology|Indo-Europeans]], shared with them a [[Roman mythology|common pantheon]] under different names but lacked the rich narrative traditions that Greek poetic culture had given [[Greek mythology|their gods]]. During the later period of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman writers borrowed much of the Greek narratives and applied them to their own pantheon, to the point where they became virtually indistinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Greek Mythography in the Roman World |first=Alan |last=Cameron |date=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-517121-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Romans studied Greek astronomy, they gave the planets their own gods' names: ''[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]]'' (for Hermes), ''[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]'' (Aphrodite), ''[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]'' (Ares), ''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Iuppiter]]'' (Zeus) and ''[[Saturn (mythology)|Saturnus]]'' (Cronus). When subsequent planets were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, the naming practice was retained with ''[[Neptune (mythology)|Neptūnus]]'' ([[Poseidon]]). Uranus is unique in that it is named for a [[Uranus (mythology)|Greek deity]] rather than his [[Caelus|Roman counterpart]].

Some [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], following a belief possibly originating in [[Mesopotamia]] but developed in [[Hellenistic Egypt]],&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Arnett |date=2006 |title=Appendix 5: Planetary Linguistics |url=http://www.nineplanets.org/days.html |publisher=www.nineplanets.org |accessdate=2008-02-02}}{{Verify credibility|date=February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; believed that the seven gods after whom the planets were named took hourly shifts in looking after affairs on Earth. The order of shifts went Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon (from the farthest to the closest planet).&lt;ref name="zerubavel"&gt;{{cite book | first=Eviatar |last=Zerubavel |date=1989 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-98165-7 |title= The Seven Day Circle: The History and Meaning of the Week |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aGahKeojIUoC&amp;pg=PA14 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the first day was started by Saturn (1st hour), second day by Sun (25th hour), followed by Moon (49th hour), Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus. Because each day was named by the god that started it, this is also the order of the [[Week-day names|days of the week]] in the [[Roman calendar]] after the [[Roman Calendar#Nundinal cycle|Nundinal cycle]] was rejected – and still preserved in many modern languages.&lt;ref name="weekdays"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Michael |last=Falk |title=Astronomical Names for the Days of the Week |journal=Journal of the [[Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]] |date=1999 |volume=93 |pages=122–133 |bibcode=1999JRASC..93..122F |doi=10.1016/j.newast.2003.07.002 | last2=Koresko | first2=Christopher|arxiv=astro-ph/0307398 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, ''Saturday, Sunday,'' and ''Monday'' are straightforward translations of these Roman names. The other days were renamed after ''[[Týr|Tiw]]'' (Tuesday), ''[[Woden|Wóden]]'' (Wednesday), ''[[Thor|Thunor]]'' (Thursday), and ''[[Frige|Fríge]]'' (Friday), the [[Anglo-Saxon gods]] considered similar or equivalent to Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus, respectively.

Earth is the only planet whose name in English is not derived from Greco-Roman mythology. Because it was only generally accepted as a planet in the 17th century,&lt;ref name="galileo_project"&gt;{{cite web | last=Van Helden |first=Al |date=1995 |url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/theories/copernican_system.html |title=Copernican System |publisher=The Galileo Project |accessdate=2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no tradition of naming it after a god. (The same is true, in English at least, of the Sun and the Moon, though they are no longer generally considered planets.) The name originates from the 8th century [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] word ''erda'', which means ground or soil and was first used in writing as the name of the sphere of Earth perhaps around 1300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher= Oxford English Dictionary |url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50071589?query_type=word&amp;queryword=earth&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=7aas-q054tm-4631&amp;hilite=50071589 | title = earth, n |accessdate = 2008-02-06 |date = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="etymearth"&gt;{{cite web | last = Harper | first = Douglas |date = September 2001 |url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=earth |title = Earth |work= Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate = 2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with its equivalents in the other [[Germanic languages]], it derives ultimately from the [[Proto-Germanic]] word ''ertho'', "ground",&lt;ref name="etymearth"/&gt; as can be seen in the English ''earth'', the German ''Erde'', the Dutch ''aarde'', and the Scandinavian ''jord''. Many of the [[Romance languages]] retain the old Roman word ''[[Terra (mythology)|terra]]'' (or some variation of it) that was used with the meaning of "dry land" as opposed to "sea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |date=September 2001 |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=terrain |title=Etymology of "terrain" |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2008-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-Romance languages use their own native words. The Greeks retain their original name, ''[[Gaia (mythology)|Γή]]'' ''(Ge)''.

Non-European cultures use other planetary-naming systems. [[India]] uses a system based on the [[Navagraha]], which incorporates the seven traditional planets ([[Surya]] for the Sun, [[Chandra]] for the Moon, and [[Budha]], [[Shukra]], [[Mangala]], [[Bṛhaspati|{{IAST|Bṛhaspati}}]] and [[Shani]] for Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) and the ascending and descending [[lunar node]]s [[Rahu]] and [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]]. China and the countries of eastern Asia historically subject to [[Chinese cultural sphere|Chinese cultural influence]] (such as Japan, [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]) use a naming system based on the [[Wu Xing|five Chinese elements]]: [[Water (classical element)|water]] (Mercury), [[Metal (classical element)|metal]] (Venus), [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] (Mars), [[Wood (classical element)|wood]] (Jupiter) and [[Earth (classical element)|earth]] (Saturn).&lt;ref name="weekdays" /&gt; In traditional [[Hebrew astronomy]], the seven traditional planets have (for the most part) descriptive names - the Sun is חמה ''Ḥammah'' or "the hot one," the Moon is לבנה ''Levanah'' or "the white one," Venus is כוכב נוגה ''Kokhav Nogah'' or "the bright planet," Mercury is כוכב ''Kokhav'' or "the planet" (given its lack of distinguishing features), Mars is מאדים ''Ma'adim'' or "the red one," and Saturn is שבתאי ''Shabbatai'' or "the resting one" (in reference to its slow movement compared to the other visible planets).&lt;ref name=Hebrew&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stieglitz|first1=Robert|title=The Hebrew Names of the Seven Planets|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|date=Apr 1981|volume=40|issue=2|pages=135–137|doi=10.1086/372867|jstor=545038}}&lt;/ref&gt; The odd one out is Jupiter, called צדק ''Tzedeq'' or "justice."

== Formation ==
{{Main|Nebular hypothesis}}
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.35|An artist's impression of protoplanetary disk]]
It is not known with certainty how planets are formed. The prevailing theory is that they are formed during the collapse of a [[nebula]] into a thin disk of gas and dust. A [[protostar]] forms at the core, surrounded by a rotating [[protoplanetary disk]]. Through [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] (a process of sticky collision) dust particles in the disk steadily accumulate mass to form ever-larger bodies. Local concentrations of mass known as [[planetesimal]]s form, and these accelerate the accretion process by drawing in additional material by their gravitational attraction. These concentrations become ever denser until they collapse inward under gravity to form [[protoplanet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=G.

With the discovery and observation of [[planetary system]]s around stars other than the Sun, it is becoming possible to elaborate, revise or even replace this account.

There are eight planets in the [[Solar System]], which are in increasing distance from the [[Sun]]:

# [[File:Mercury symbol.svg|14px|☿]] '''[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'''
# [[File:Venus symbol.svg|14px|♀]] '''[[Venus]]'''
# [[File:Earth symbol.svg|14px|⊕]] '''[[Earth]]'''

# [[File:Uranus symbol.svg|14px|♅]] '''[[Uranus]]'''
# [[File:Neptune symbol.svg|14px|♆]] '''[[Neptune]]'''

Jupiter is the largest, at 318 Earth masses, whereas Mercury is the smallest, at 0.055 Earth masses.

The planets of the Solar System can be divided into categories based on their composition:
* '''[[Terrestrial planet|Terrestrials]]''': Planets that are similar to Earth, with bodies largely composed of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. At 0.055 Earth masses, Mercury is the smallest terrestrial planet (and smallest planet) in the Solar System. Earth is the largest terrestrial planet.
* '''[[Giant planet]]s''' (Jovians): Massive planets significantly more massive than the terrestrials: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
** '''[[Gas giant]]s''', Jupiter and Saturn, are giant planets primarily composed of hydrogen and helium and are the most massive planets in the Solar System. Jupiter, at 318 Earth masses, is the largest planet in the Solar System, and Saturn is one third as massive, at 95 Earth masses.
** '''[[Ice giant]]s''', Uranus and Neptune, are primarily composed of low-boiling-point materials such as water, methane, and ammonia, with thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium. They have a significantly lower mass than the gas giants (only 14 and 17 Earth masses).

In early 1992, radio astronomers [[Aleksander Wolszczan]] and [[Dale Frail]] announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the [[pulsar]] [[PSR 1257+12]].&lt;ref name="Wolszczan"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wolszczan | first1 = A. |bibcode=1992Natur.355..145W| last2 = Frail | first2 = D.

These pulsar planets are believed to have formed from the unusual remnants of the [[supernova]] that produced the pulsar, in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining rocky cores of [[giant planet]]s that survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits.

The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star occurred on 6 October 1995, when [[Michel Mayor]] and [[Didier Queloz]] of the [[University of Geneva]] announced the detection of an exoplanet around [[51 Pegasi]]. From then until the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler mission]] most known extrasolar planets were gas giants comparable in mass to Jupiter or larger as they were more easily detected. The catalog of Kepler candidate planets consists mostly of planets the size of Neptune and smaller, down to smaller than Mercury.

There are types of planets that do not exist in the Solar System: [[super-Earth]]s and [[mini-Neptune]]s, which could be rocky like Earth or a mixture of volatiles and gas like Neptune—a radius of 1.75 times that of Earth is a possible dividing line between the two types of planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1311.0329 |last1=Lopez |first1=E.

Another possible type of planet is [[carbon planet]]s, which form in systems with a higher proportion of carbon than in the Solar System.

A 2012 study, analyzing [[gravitational microlensing]] data, estimates an [[Arithmetic mean|average]] of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way.&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt;

The frequency of occurrence of such terrestrial planets is one of the variables in the [[Drake equation]], which estimates the number of [[Extraterrestrial life|intelligent, communicating civilizations]] that exist in the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Drake |first=Frank |title=The Drake Equation Revisited |publisher=Astrobiology Magazine |date=2003-09-29 |url=http://www.astrobio.net/index.php?option=com_retrospection&amp;task=detail&amp;id=610 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628180502/http://www.astrobio.net/index.php?option=com_retrospection&amp;task=detail&amp;id=610 |archivedate=2011-06-28 |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are exoplanets that are much closer to their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun, and there are also exoplanets that are much farther from their star. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the closest planet to the Sun at 0.4 [[astronomical unit|AU]], takes 88 days for an orbit, but the shortest known orbits for exoplanets take only a few hours, e.g. [[Kepler-70b]]. The [[Kepler-11]] system has five of its planets in shorter orbits than Mercury's, all of them much more massive than Mercury. [[Neptune]] is 30 AU from the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit, but there are exoplanets that are hundreds of [[astronomical unit|AU]] from their star and take more than a thousand years to orbit, e.g. [[1RXS1609 b]].

The next few [[space telescope]]s to study exoplanets are expected to be [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia]] launched in December 2013, [[CHEOPS (spacecraft)|CHEOPS]] in 2018, [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] in 2018, and the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] in 2021.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, all planets are ''planetary-mass objects'', but the purpose of this term is to refer to objects that do not conform to typical expectations for a planet. These include [[dwarf planet]]s, which are rounded by their own gravity but not massive enough to [[Clearing the neighbourhood|clear their own orbit]], the larger [[natural satellite|moons]], and free-floating planemos, which may have been ejected from a system ([[rogue planet]]s) or formed through cloud-collapse rather than accretion (sometimes called [[sub-brown dwarf]]s).

=== Dwarf planets ===
{{Main|Dwarf planet}}

A dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that is neither a true planet nor a natural satellite; it is in direct orbit of a star, and is massive enough for its gravity to compress it into a hydrostatically equilibrious shape (usually a spheroid), but has not cleared the neighborhood of other material around its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/Resolution_GA26-5-6.pdf ''IAU 2006 General Assembly.''

=== Sub-brown dwarfs ===
{{Main|Sub-brown dwarf}}
Stars form via the gravitational collapse of gas clouds, but smaller objects can also form via cloud-collapse. Planetary-mass objects formed this way are sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs. Sub-brown dwarfs may be free-floating such as [[Cha 110913-773444]]&lt;ref name="Luhman" /&gt; and [[OTS 44]],&lt;ref name=joergens2013_AA558&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joergens|first1=V.|display-authors=4|last2=Bonnefoy|first2=M.|last3=Liu|first3=Y.|last4=Bayo|first4=A.|last5=Wolf|first5=S.|last6=Chauvin|first6=G.|last7=Rojo|first7=P.|title=OTS 44: Disk and accretion at the planetary border|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|volume=558|number=7|date=2013|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201322432|bibcode=2013A&amp;A...558L...7J|arxiv = 1310.1936|pages=L7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or orbiting a larger object such as [[2MASS J04414489+2301513]].

Binary systems of sub-brown dwarfs are theoretically possible; [[Oph 162225-240515]] was initially thought to be a binary system of a brown dwarf of 14 Jupiter masses and a sub-brown dwarf of 7 Jupiter masses, but further observations revised the estimated masses upwards to greater than 13 Jupiter masses, making them brown dwarfs according to the IAU working definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Wide Brown Dwarf Binary Oph 1622–2405 and Discovery of A Wide, Low Mass Binary in Ophiuchus (Oph 1623–2402): A New Class of Young Evaporating Wide Binaries? |journal= Astrophysical Journal |author=Close, Laird M. |volume=660 | issue=2 |pages=1492–1506 |doi=10.1086/513417 |date=2007 |arxiv=astro-ph/0608574 |bibcode=2007ApJ...660.1492C | display-authors=4 | last2=Zuckerman | first2=B. | last3=Song | first3=Inseok | last4=Barman | first4=Travis | last5=Marois | first5=Christian | last6=Rice | first6=Emily L. | last7=Siegler | first7=Nick | last8=MacIntosh | first8=Bruce | last9=Becklin | first9=E.

=== Former stars ===
In close [[binary star]] systems one of the stars can lose mass to a heavier companion. [[Accretion-powered pulsars]] may drive mass loss. The shrinking star can then become a [[#Planetary-mass objects|planetary-mass object]]. An example is a Jupiter-mass object orbiting the [[pulsar]] [[PSR J1719-1438]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1108.5201 |bibcode=2011Sci...333.1717B |doi=10.1126/science.1208890 |title=Transformation of a Star into a Planet in a Millisecond Pulsar Binary |date=2011 |last1=Bailes |first1=M. |display-authors=4 |last2=Bates |first2=S.

=== Satellite planets and belt planets ===
Some large satellites (moons) are of similar size or larger than the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], e.g. Jupiter's [[Galilean moons]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. [[Alan Stern]] has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes should be taken into account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term ''satellite planet'' for a planet-sized satellite. Likewise, dwarf planets in the [[asteroid belt]] and [[Kuiper belt]] should be considered planets according to Stern.&lt;ref name="satelliteplanet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/should-large-moons-be-called-satellite-planets.html#post-a-comment |title=Should Large Moons Be Called 'Satellite Planets'? |publisher=News.discovery.com |date=2010-05-14 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Captured planets ===
[[Rogue planet]]s in [[Open cluster|stellar clusters]] have similar velocities to the stars and so can be recaptured. They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and &lt;!--abstract seems to have a typo 10^6: rest of paper uses 10^5--&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; AU&lt;!--see preceding comment--&gt;. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster volume, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass. It is almost independent of the planetary mass. Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits, non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin, or pre-existing planetary system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2362 On the origin of planets at very wide orbits from the re-capture of free floating planets], Hagai B. Perets, M. B. N. Kouwenhoven, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Although each planet has unique physical characteristics, a number of broad commonalities do exist among them. Some of these characteristics, such as rings or natural satellites, have only as yet been observed in planets in the Solar System, whereas others are also commonly observed in extrasolar planets.

=== Dynamic characteristics ===

==== Orbit ====
{{Main|Orbit|Orbital elements}}
{{see also|Kepler's laws of planetary motion}}
[[File:TheKuiperBelt Orbits Pluto Ecliptic.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The orbit of the planet Neptune compared to that of [[Pluto]]. Note the elongation of Pluto's orbit in relation to Neptune's ([[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]]), as well as its large angle to the ecliptic ([[inclination]]).]]

According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential "[[rogue planet]]s" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, [[WASP-17b]], has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = D. R.

No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its [[periastron]] ([[perihelion]] in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its [[apastron]] ([[aphelion]]). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Dvorak, R. | author2=Kurths, J. | author3=Freistetter, F. |date=2005 |title=Chaos And Stability in Planetary Systems |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=3-540-28208-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:
* The ''[[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]]'' of an orbit describes how elongated a planet's orbit is. Planets with low eccentricities have more circular orbits, whereas planets with high eccentricities have more elliptical orbits. The planets in the Solar System have very low eccentricities, and thus nearly circular orbits.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; Comets and Kuiper belt objects (as well as several extrasolar planets) have very high eccentricities, and thus exceedingly elliptical orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Eccentricity evolution of giant planet orbits due to circumstellar disk torques |author=Moorhead, Althea V. |author2=Adams, Fred C. |journal=Icarus |date=2008 |volume=193 |issue=2 |pages=475–484 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2007.07.009 |arxiv=0708.0335 |bibcode=2008Icar..193..475M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Planets – Kuiper Belt Objects |work=The Astrophysics Spectator |date=2004-12-15 | url=http://www.astrophysicsspectator.com/topics/planets/KuiperBelt.html |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[File:Semimajoraxis.svg|thumb|Illustration of the semi-major axis]] The ''[[semi-major axis]]'' is the distance from a planet to the half-way point along the longest diameter of its elliptical orbit (see image). This distance is not the same as its apastron, because no planet's orbit has its star at its exact centre.&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;
* The ''[[inclination]]'' of a planet tells how far above or below an established reference plane its orbit lies. In the Solar System, the reference plane is the plane of Earth's orbit, called the [[ecliptic]]. For extrasolar planets, the plane, known as the ''sky plane'' or ''plane of the sky'', is the plane perpendicular to the observer's line of sight from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/~tatum/celmechs.html |title=Celestial Mechanics |date=2007 |chapter=17. Visual binary stars |first=J. B. |last=Tatum |accessdate=2008-02-02 |publisher=Personal web page}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eight planets of the Solar System all lie very close to the ecliptic; comets and [[Kuiper belt]] objects like Pluto are at far more extreme angles to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Correlation between Inclination and Color in the Classical Kuiper Belt | last1=Trujillo |first1=Chadwick A. |author2=Brown, Michael E. |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=2002 |bibcode=2002ApJ...566L.125T | volume=566 |issue=2 | pages=L125 |doi=10.1086/339437|arxiv = astro-ph/0201040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The points at which a planet crosses above and below its reference plane are called its [[ascending node|ascending]] and [[descending node]]s.&lt;ref name="young" /&gt; The [[longitude of the ascending node]] is the angle between the reference plane's 0 longitude and the planet's ascending node. The [[argument of periapsis]] (or perihelion in the Solar System) is the angle between a planet's ascending node and its closest approach to its star.&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;

==== Axial tilt ====
{{Main|Axial tilt}}
[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|Earth's [[axial tilt]] is about 23.4°. It oscillates between 22.1° and 24.5° on a 41,000-year cycle and is currently decreasing.]]

Planets also have varying degrees of axial tilt; they lie at an angle to the [[reference plane|plane]] of their [[inclination|stars' equators]]. This causes the amount of light received by each hemisphere to vary over the course of its year; when the northern hemisphere points away from its star, the southern hemisphere points towards it, and vice versa. Each planet therefore has seasons, changes to the climate over the course of its year. The time at which each hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its [[solstice]]. Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice, when its day is longest, the other has its winter solstice, when its day is shortest. The varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet. Jupiter's axial tilt is very small, so its seasonal variation is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side, which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices.&lt;ref name="Weather"&gt;{{cite web | last=Harvey |first=Samantha |date=2006-05-01 |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=725 |title=Weather, Weather, Everywhere? |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among extrasolar planets, axial tilts are not known for certain, though most hot Jupiters are believed to have negligible to no axial tilt as a result of their proximity to their stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Obliquity Tides on Hot Jupiters |author=Winn, Joshua N. |author2=Holman, Matthew J. |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=2005 | doi=10.1086/432834 | volume=628 |issue=2 |pages=L159 |bibcode=2005ApJ...628L.159W|arxiv = astro-ph/0506468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rotation ====
The planets rotate around invisible axes through their centres. A planet's [[rotation period]] is known as a [[day|stellar day]]. Most of the planets in the Solar System rotate in the same direction as they orbit the Sun, which is counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Geographic poles|north pole]], the exceptions being Venus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rotation of Venus: Period Estimated from Radar Measurements |author=Goldstein, R. M. |author2=Carpenter, R. L. |date=1963 |journal =Science |volume=139 |doi=10.1126/science.139.3558.910 |pmid=17743054 |issue=3558 |bibcode=1963Sci...139..910G |pages=910–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Uranus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rotational properties of Uranus and Neptune |first1=M.

T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which rotate clockwise, though Uranus's extreme axial tilt means there are differing conventions on which of its poles is "north", and therefore whether it is rotating clockwise or anti-clockwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Outer Worlds; Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and Beyond |pages=195–206 |date=2006 |first=Michael P. |last=Borgia |publisher=Springer New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of which convention is used, Uranus has a [[retrograde rotation]] relative to its orbit.

The rotation of a planet can be induced by several factors during formation. A net [[angular momentum]] can be induced by the individual angular momentum contributions of accreted objects. The accretion of gas by the giant planets can also contribute to the angular momentum. Finally, during the last stages of planet building, a [[stochastic process]] of protoplanetary accretion can randomly alter the spin axis of the planet.&lt;ref name="araa31"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Planet formation |last=Lissauer | series=31 |first=Jack J. |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=(A94-12726 02–90) | issue=1 |pages=129–174 |date=1993 |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.31.090193.001021 |bibcode=1993ARA&amp;A..31..129L}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is great variation in the length of day between the planets, with Venus taking 243 [[Julian day|days]] to rotate, and the giant planets only a few hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Planet tables |url=http://www.astronomynotes.com/tables/tablesb.htm |first=Nick |last=Strobel |publisher=astronomynotes.com |accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rotational periods of extrasolar planets are not known. However, for "hot" Jupiters, their proximity to their stars means that they are [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] (i.e., their orbits are in sync with their rotations). This means, they always show one face to their stars, with one side in perpetual day, the other in perpetual night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Magnetically-Driven Planetary Radio Emissions and Application to Extrasolar Planets | last1=Zarka |first1=Philippe |author2=Treumann, Rudolf A. |author3=Ryabov, Boris P. |author4=Ryabov, Vladimir B. |date=2001 |journal=Astrophysics &amp; Space Science |volume=277 |issue=1/2 |pages=293–300 |doi = 10.1023/A:1012221527425|bibcode = 2001Ap&amp;SS.277..293Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Orbital clearing ====
{{Main|Clearing the neighbourhood}}
The defining dynamic characteristic of a planet is that it has ''cleared its neighborhood''. A planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the [[planetesimal]]s in its orbit. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated as part of the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s official [[2006 definition of planet|definition of a planet]] in August, 2006. This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as [[Pluto]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] and [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] from full-fledged planethood, making them instead [[dwarf planet]]s.&lt;ref name="IAU" /&gt; Although to date this criterion only applies to the Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their [[circumstellar disc]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |title=The Total Number of Giant Planets in Debris Disks with Central Clearings |date=2007-07-12 |author=Faber, Peter |author2=Quillen, Alice C. |eprint=0706.1684 |class=astro-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical characteristics ===

==== Mass ====
{{Main|Planetary mass}}
A planet's defining physical characteristic is that it is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the [[electromagnetic force]]s binding its physical structure, leading to a state of [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Dwarf Planets |url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dwarfplanets/ |authorlink=Michael E. Brown |last=Brown |first=Michael E. |work=California Institute of Technology |date=2006 |accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass is also the prime attribute by which planets are distinguished from [[star]]s. The upper mass limit for planethood is roughly 13 times Jupiter's mass for objects with solar-type [[isotopic abundance]], beyond which it achieves conditions suitable for [[nuclear fusion]]. Other than the Sun, no objects of such mass exist in the Solar System; but there are exoplanets of this size. The 13-Jupiter-mass limit is not universally agreed upon and the [[Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] includes objects up to 20 Jupiter masses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=exoplanet-catalogue How One Astronomer Became the Unofficial Exoplanet Record-Keeper], www.scientificamerican.com&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Exoplanet Data Explorer]] up to 24 Jupiter masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1012.5676 |author1=Jason T Wright |author2=Onsi Fakhouri |author3=Marcy |author4=Eunkyu Han |author5=Ying Feng |author6=John Asher Johnson |author7=Howard |author8=Fischer |author9=Valenti |title=The Exoplanet Orbit Database |date=2010|last10=Anderson |first10=Jay |last11=Piskunov |first11=Nikolai |doi=10.1086/659427 |volume=123 |issue=902 |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |pages=412–422 |bibcode=2011PASP..123..412W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smallest known planet is [[PSR B1257+12A]], one of the first extrasolar planets discovered, which was found in 1992 in orbit around a [[pulsar]]. Its mass is roughly half that of the planet Mercury.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia" /&gt; The smallest known planet orbiting a main-sequence star other than the Sun is [[Kepler-37b]], with a mass (and radius) slightly higher than that of the [[Moon]].

==== Internal differentiation ====
{{Main|Planetary differentiation}}
[[File:Jupiter interior.png|upright|thumb|Illustration of the interior of Jupiter, with a rocky core overlaid by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen]]

Every planet began its existence in an entirely fluid state; in early formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving the lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a [[Planetary differentiation|differentiated]] interior consisting of a dense [[planetary core]] surrounded by a [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] that either is or was a [[fluid]]. The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard [[Crust (geology)|crusts]],&lt;ref name="terrestrial"&gt;{{cite web |title=Planetary Interiors |work=Department of Physics, University of Oregon |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/lec16.html |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends into the upper cloud layers. The terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as [[iron]] and [[nickel]], and mantles of [[silicate]]s. [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] are believed to have cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of [[metallic hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Linda T. |last=Elkins-Tanton |date=2006 |title=Jupiter and Saturn |publisher=Chelsea House |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-5196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], which are smaller, have rocky cores surrounded by mantles of [[water]], [[ammonia]], [[methane]] and other [[Volatiles|ices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1016/0032-0633(95)00061-5| last1 = Podolak| first1 = M.| last2 = Weizman| first2 = A.| last3 = Marley| first3 = M.| date=December 1995 | title = Comparative models of Uranus and Neptune| journal = Planetary and Space Science| volume = 43| issue = 12| pages = 1517–1522| pmid = | pmc = | bibcode = 1995P&amp;SS...43.1517P| ref = {{sfnRef|Podolak Weizman et al.|1995}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fluid action within these planets' cores creates a [[geodynamo]] that generates a [[magnetic field]].&lt;ref name="terrestrial" /&gt;

Planetary atmospheres are affected by the varying [[insolation]] or internal energy, leading to the formation of dynamic [[weather system]]s such as [[hurricane]]s, (on Earth), planet-wide [[dust storm]]s (on Mars), a greater-than-Earth-sized [[Anticyclonic storm|anticyclone]] on Jupiter (called the [[Great Red Spot]]), and [[Great Dark Spot|holes in the atmosphere]] (on Neptune).&lt;ref name="Weather" /&gt; At least one extrasolar planet, [[HD 189733 b]], has been claimed to have such a weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large.&lt;ref name="knutson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Knutson |first1=Heather A. |author2=Charbonneau, David |author3=Allen, Lori E. |author4=Fortney, Jonathan J. |title=A map of the day-night contrast of the extrasolar planet HD 189733 b |journal=Nature |date=2007 |volume=447 |doi=10.1038/nature05782 |laysummary=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2007/pr200713.html |laysource=Center for Astrophysics press release |laydate=2007-05-09 |pmid=17495920 |issue=7141 |bibcode=2007Natur.447..183K | pages=183–6|arxiv = 0705.0993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Magnetosphere ====
{{Main|Magnetosphere}}
[[File:Structure of the magnetosphere-en.svg|thumb|[[Earth's magnetic field|Earth's magnetosphere]] (diagram)]]

One important characteristic of the planets is their intrinsic [[magnetic moment]]s, which in turn give rise to magnetospheres. The presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive. In other words, magnetized planets have flows of [[electrical conductivity|electrically conducting]] material in their interiors, which generate their magnetic fields. These fields significantly change the interaction of the planet and solar wind. A magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called the magnetosphere, which the wind cannot penetrate. The magnetosphere can be much larger than the planet itself. In contrast, non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the [[ionosphere]] with the solar wind, which cannot effectively protect the planet.&lt;ref name="Kivelson2007" /&gt;

Of the eight planets in the Solar System, only Venus and Mars lack such a magnetic field.&lt;ref name="Kivelson2007" /&gt; In addition, the moon of Jupiter [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] also has one. Of the magnetized planets the magnetic field of Mercury is the weakest, and is barely able to deflect the [[solar wind]]. Ganymede's magnetic field is several times larger, and Jupiter's is the strongest in the Solar System (so strong in fact that it poses a serious health risk to future manned missions to its moons). The magnetic fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of Earth, but their magnetic moments are significantly larger. The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are strongly tilted relative the rotational [[Axis of rotation|axis]] and displaced from the centre of the planet.&lt;ref name="Kivelson2007"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Kivelson |first1=Margaret Galland |author2=Bagenal, Fran |chapter=Planetary Magnetospheres |title=Encyclopedia of the Solar System |date=2007 |publisher=Academic Press |editor= Lucyann Mcfadden |editor2= Paul Weissman |editor3= Torrence Johnson |isbn=978-0-12-088589-3 |page=519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a team of astronomers in Hawaii observed an extrasolar planet around the star [[HD 179949]], which appeared to be creating a sunspot on the surface of its parent star. The team hypothesized that the planet's magnetosphere was transferring energy onto the star's surface, increasing its already high 7,760&amp;nbsp;°C temperature by an additional 400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Magnetic planet |first=Amanda | last=Gefter | work=Astronomy |date=2004-01-17 |url=http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=2090 |accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several planets or dwarf planets in the Solar System (such as Neptune and Pluto) have orbital periods that are in [[Orbital resonance|resonance]] with each other or with smaller bodies (this is also common in satellite systems). All except Mercury and Venus have [[natural satellite]]s, often called "moons". Earth has one, Mars has two, and the giant planets have numerous moons in complex planetary-type systems. Many moons of the giant planets have features similar to those on the terrestrial planets and dwarf planets, and some have been studied as possible abodes of life (especially [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]).&lt;ref name="Grasset2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Grasset |first1=O. |author2=Sotin C. |author3=Deschamps F. |title = On the internal structure and dynamic of Titan |date = 2000 |journal = Planetary and Space Science |volume = 48 | issue= 7–8 | pages = 617–636 |doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(00)00039-8 | bibcode=2000P&amp;SS...48..617G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortes2000"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Icarus |volume= 146 |issue = 2 |pages = 444–452 |date= 2000 |doi = 10.1006/icar.2000.6400 |title = Exobiological implications of a possible ammonia-water ocean inside Titan |author = Fortes, A.

The four giant planets are also orbited by [[planetary ring]]s of varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny '[[Rings of Saturn#Moonlets|moonlets]]' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although the origins of planetary rings is not precisely known, they are believed to be the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet's [[Roche limit]] and were torn apart by [[tidal force]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Molnar, L. A. | author2=Dunn, D. E. |title=On the Formation of Planetary Rings |journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society |date=1996 |volume=28 |pages=77–115 |bibcode=1996DPS....28.1815M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Encrenaz |last=Thérèse |date=2004 |title=The Solar System |edition=Third |pages=388–390 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-00241-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No secondary characteristics have been observed around extrasolar planets. The [[sub-brown dwarf]] [[Cha 110913-773444]], which has been described as a [[rogue planet]], is believed to be orbited by a tiny [[protoplanetary disc]]&lt;ref name="Luhman" /&gt; and the sub-brown dwarf [[OTS 44]] was shown to be surrounded by a substantial protoplanetary disk of at least 10 Earth masses.&lt;ref name=joergens2013_AA558 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1820">A '''point of delivery''', or '''PoD''', is "a module of network, compute, storage, and application components that work together to deliver networking services. The PoD is a repeatable [[design pattern]], and its components maximize the modularity, scalability, and manageability of data centers." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps9441/ps10110/data_sheet_c78-507093.html#wp9000106 Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders Data Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[modular design]] principle has been applied to telephone and data networks, for instance through a repeatable [[Node (networking)|node]] design describing the configuration of equipment housed in [[point of presence]] facilities. The term is similarly used in cable video networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cablelabs.com/news/pr/2000/2000_01_18.html |title=CableLabs® Releases OpenCable™ POD Interface Copy Protection System Specification |publisher=CableLabs |date=January 18, 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121015555/http://cablelabs.com/news/pr/2000/2000_01_18.html|archivedate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the modular component that delivers video service to a subscriber. The distinction of a PoD versus other [[design pattern]]s is that it is a [[System deployment|deployable]] [[Modular programming|module]] which delivers a [[Service (economics)|service]].

The PoD [[design pattern]] is especially important in [[service provider]] [[infrastructure]], for instance in [[Data center|datacenters]] supporting [[cloud computing]] [[Service (economics)|services]], in order to sustain [[scalability]] as usage grows.

'''Radiation dose reconstruction''' refers to the process of estimating [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] doses that were received by individuals or populations in the past as a result of particular exposure situations of concern.&lt;ref name=dtra&gt;''A Review of the Dose Reconstruction Program of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency''. The National Academies Press, 2003, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle of radiation dose reconstruction is to characterize the radiation environment to which individuals have been exposed using available information. In cases where radiation exposures can not be fully characterized based on available data, default values based on reasonable scientific assumptions can be used as substitutes.  The extent to which the default values are used depends on the purpose of the reconstruction(s) being undertaken.

==Background==
The methods and techniques used in dose reconstructions have been growing and evolving rapidly. It wasn’t until the late 1970s that dose reconstruction emerged as a scientific discipline&lt;ref name=DRVid&gt;National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/ocasdose.html#drvideo Dose Reconstruction Program Video]&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been used in practice in the United States for the last two decades.&lt;ref name=dtra2&gt;A Review of the Dose Reconstruction Program of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, The National Academies Press, 2003, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific methods and practices used to complete dose reconstructions are often based on the standards published by international consensus organizations such as the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]].&lt;ref name=DRVid /&gt; 

When conducted properly, dose reconstruction is a scientifically valid process for estimating radiation dose received by an individual or group of individuals.  It is commonly used in occupational epidemiological studies to determine the amount of radiation workers may have received as part of their employment.  For these types of studies, dose reconstruction is similar to the process of estimating how much radiation current workers receive, for example at a nuclear facility, except dose reconstructions evaluate past exposures. The terms historical and retrospective often are used to describe a dose reconstruction.&lt;ref name=dtra2 /&gt;  Dose estimation is the term sometimes used to describe the process used to determine radiation exposures to current populations or individuals.     

Dose reconstruction methods have also commonly been applied in environmental settings to assess [[radionuclide]] releases into the environment from nuclear sites.  One such environmentally focused study was published in 1983 by the [[U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] entitled Radiological Risk Assessment:  A Textbook on Environmental Dose Analysis.  This book was updated with major revisions in 2008 and it details the steps of radiological assessments, which uses similar methods and techniques as a dose reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Till, John and Grogan, Helen, eds; Radiological Risk Assessment and Environmental Analysis, Oxford University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Dose reconstruction methods are not limited to just measuring exposures to radiation.  Dose reconstruction principles can be used to reconstruct exposures to other hazardous materials and to determine the health effects of those toxins to populations or individuals.

==Radiation dose reconstruction elements==

The dose reconstruction process has several basic elements, which have been identified as follows:
* Definition of exposure scenarios,
* Identification of exposure pathways,
* Development and implementation of methods of estimating dose,
* Evaluation of uncertainties in estimates of dose,
* Presentation and interpretation of results,
* Quality assurance and quality control.

==Research and applications==
Radiation dose reconstruction methods are used to a large extent in occupational, environmental, and medical epidemiological research studies.  
The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) has been involved in several dose reconstruction projects.          

Several CDC agencies are involved in dose reconstruction projects:  the [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR), the [[National Center for Environmental Health]] (NCEH), and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH).

===Superfund sites===
The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) conducts dose reconstructions in relation to work done at [[Superfund sites]].  ATSDR defines exposure-dose reconstruction as an approach that uses computational models and other approximation techniques to estimate cumulative amounts of hazardous substances internalized by individuals presumed to be or who are actually at risk from contact with substances associated with hazardous waste sites.

===Exposure-dose reconstruction program===
In March 1993, ATSDR established the Exposure-Dose Reconstruction Program (EDRP).  EDRP represents a coordinated, comprehensive effort to develop sensitive, integrated, science-based methods for improving health scientists’ and assessors’ access to current and historical exposure-dose characterization.  EDRP was created to confront the challenge that faced health scientists and assessors who have not always had access to information-especially historical information regarding an individual’s direct measure of exposure to and dose of chemicals associated with hazardous waste sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/edrp/ Exposure-Dose Reconstruction Program (EDRP)] Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Accessed September 04, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epidemiological health studies===
The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) coordinates program and conducts environmental epidemiological health studies using dose reconstruction principles. NCEH has undertaken a series of studies to assess the possible health consequences of off-site emissions of radioactive materials from DOE-managed nuclear facilities in the United States.&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;National Research Council (U.S.), Committee on an Assessment of CDC Radiation Studies, Radiation Dose Reconstruction for Epidemiologic Uses, National Academy Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Dose reconstruction as used by NCEH is defined as the process of estimating doses to the public from past releases to the environment of radionuclides or chemicals. These doses form the basis for estimating health risks.  Past exposures are the focus of the NCEH studies.&lt;ref name=NRC /&gt;

===Occupational energy research===
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) completes dose reconstructions as a component of ongoing worker health studies. The NIOSH Occupational Energy Research Program’s mission is to conduct relevant, unbiased research to identify and quantify health effects among workers exposed to ionizing radiation and other agents; to develop and refine exposure assessment methods; to effectively communicate study results to workers, scientists, and the public; to contribute scientific information for the prevention of occupational injury and illness; and to adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and concern for workers’ health, safety and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/oerp/ Occupational Energy Research Program] NIOSH. Accessed September 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program of 2000===
One of the largest mass applications of individual dose reconstruction principles is also being undertaken by NIOSH.  NIOSH is the designated agency responsible for completing radiation dose reconstructions for individuals under the [[Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program| Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program of 2000]] (the Act).  Under the Act, individuals, and in some cases their survivors, are eligible for compensation for specified illnesses they received from occupational exposures to beryllium, asbestos, toxic materials, and radiation if they worked at a covered [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) facility or a facility that contracted with DOE to produce nuclear weapons or components, known as Atomic Weapons Employers (AWE).  The program is administered by the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]].  NIOSH’s responsibility under the Act is to determine the probability that an individual’s cancer was a result of their occupational radiation exposure at a DOE or AWE facility.  This probability is determined by DOL and is based on the radiation dose reconstruction completed by NIOSH.  The dose reconstructions are completed by individuals trained in the field of [[health physics]].  

The science behind the NIOSH dose reconstruction process has been published in the peer-reviewed professional journal Health Physics: The Radiation Safety Journal in July 2008. This edition of the Journal was dedicated entirely to the NIOSH Radiation Dose Reconstruction Program.

===Nuclear Test Personnel Review===
The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] uses dose reconstructions to process claims under the Nuclear Test Personnel Review (NTPR) program.  The NTPR is a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] program that works to confirm veteran participation in U.S. atmospheric nuclear tests from 1945 to 1962, and the occupation forces of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.  If the veteran is a confirmed participant of these events, NTPR may provide either an actual or estimated radiation dose received by the veteran.  The [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] completes the dose reconstructions for the NTPR program.

Rammed earth is simple to manufacture, non-combustible, [[Thermal mass|thermally massive]], strong, and durable. However, structures such as walls can be laborious to construct of rammed earth without machinery, e. g., powered tampers, and they are susceptible to water damage if inadequately protected or maintained.

Edifices formed of rammed earth are on every continent except [[Antarctica]], in a range of environments including temperate, wet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rammedearthconsulting.com/rammed-earth-CAT-lecture-theatre.htm |title=Rammed Earth Lecture Theatre, CAT |first=Rowland |last=Keable  |work=Rammed Earth Consulting |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; semiarid desert, montane, and tropical regions. The availability of suitable soil and a [[architecture|building design]] appropriate for local [[climate|climatic conditions]] are the factors that favour its use.

==Composition and use==
{{Original research | section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Tapialdebarro.jpg|thumb|left|Model of construction of a wall of rammed earth on a foundation]]
Manufacturing rammed earth involves compressing a damp mixture of [[soil|earth]] that has suitable proportions of [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[clay]], and/or an added stabilizer into an externally supported frame or mold, forming either a solid wall or individual blocks. Historically, additives such as [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] or animal blood were used to stabilize it,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} while modern construction adds [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[cement]], or [[asphalt]] emulsions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} To add variety, some modern builders also add coloured oxides or other materials, e.g. bottles, tires, or pieces of timber.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The construction of an entire wall begins with a temporary frame, denominated the "[[formwork]]", which is usually made of wood or plywood, as a mold for the desired shape and dimensions of each section of wall. The form must be durable and well braced, and the two opposing faces must be clamped together to prevent bulging or deformation caused by the large compressing forces. Damp material is poured into the formwork to a depth of {{convert|10|to|25|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and then compacted to approximately 50% of its original height.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The material is compressed iteratively, in batches or courses, so as to gradually erect the wall up to the top of the [[formwork]]. Tamping was historically manual with a long ramming pole, and was very laborious, but modern construction can be made less so by employing [[pneumatic]]ally powered tampers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

[[File:Paderne Morrish Castle 26 Nov 2007 (6).JPG|thumb|right|Taipa fortifications at [[Paderne Castle]] in the Algarve, Portugal]]

After a wall is complete, it is sufficiently strong to immediately remove the formwork.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This is necessary if a surface texture is to be applied, e.g., by wire brushing, carving, or mold impression, because the walls become too hard to work after approximately one hour.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Construction is optimally done in warm weather so that the walls can dry and harden.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[compression strength]] of the rammed earth increases as it cures; some time is necessary for it to dry and as long as two years can be necessary for complete curing.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Exposed walls must be sealed to prevent water damage.

In modern variations of the technique, rammed-earth walls are constructed on top of conventional [[Foundation (architecture)|footings]] or a [[reinforced concrete]] slab base.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Where blocks made of rammed earth are used, they are generally stacked like regular blocks and are bonded together with a thin mud slurry instead of cement.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Special machines, usually powered by small engines and often portable, are used to compress the material into blocks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Presently more than 30% of the world's population uses earth as a building material.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Rammed earth has been used globally in a wide range of climatic conditions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed-earth housing may resolve homelessness caused by otherwise expensive construction techniques.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Qualities ==
[[File:Rammed earth wall surface.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the surface of a rammed-earth wall: apart from the patches of damage, the surface shows regular horizontal lines caused by the wooden [[formwork]] and subtler horizontal strata from successive courses.]]

The [[compressive strength]] of rammed earth is a maximum of {{convert|4.3|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}. This is less than that of [[concrete]] but more than sufficiently strong for domestic edifices.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webs.ashlandctc.org/jnapora/hum-faculty/syllabi/trad.html |title=A Traditional Research Paper: Rammed Earth Construction |first=Robert O. |last=Cassell  |work=Ashland  Community  and Technical College|date= 17 December 2001 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, properly constructed rammed earth endures for thousands of years, as many ancient structures that are still standing around the world demonstrate.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rammedearthconstructions.com.au/index.php?mp_id=5 |title=BENEFITS OF BUILDING IN RAMMED EARTH |work=Rammed Earth Constructions |publisher=Rammed Earth Constructions P/L |location=[[Maleny]], [[Australia]] |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rammed earth reinforced with [[rebar]], wood, or [[bamboo]] can prevent collapse caused by earthquakes or heavy storms,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} because unreinforced edifices of rammed earth resist earthquake damage extremely poorly. See [[1960 Agadir earthquake]] for an example of the total destruction which may be inflicted on such structures by an earthquake. Adding cement to soil mixtures poor in clay can also increase the load-bearing capacity of rammed-earth edifices.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] observed in 1925 that rammed-earth structures endure indefinitely and can be constructed for less than two-thirds of the cost of standard frame houses.&lt;ref name="USDA Farmer Bulletin 1500"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaronhauser.com/rammed-earth-books/farmers-bulletin-no-1500-rammed-earth-walls-for-buildings/ |title=Farmers' Bulletin No. 1500: Rammed Earth Walls for Buildings - Rammed Earth Books - The Boden Hauser |first1=Morris Cotgrave |last1=Betts |first2=Thomas Arrington Huntington |last2=Miller |work=The Boden Hauser |page=20 |date=May 1937 |origyear=1925 |accessdate=February 4, 2012 |oclc=600507592 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225224741/http://www.aaronhauser.com/rammed-earth-books/farmers-bulletin-no-1500-rammed-earth-walls-for-buildings/ |archivedate=February 25, 2012 |df= }} Originally published by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], Washington, DC, USA.

Soil is a widely available, inexpensive, and [[sustainable]] resource.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://earth.sustainablesources.com/#Soils |title=Soils for Rammed Earth, Caliche Block, and Soil Material Construction |publisher=Sustainable Sources |location=Austin, TX, USA| accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, construction with rammed earth is very viable.{{vague|date=July 2017|reason=Viable in what sense? Compared to what? Under which circumstances?}} Unskilled labour can do most of the necessary work.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; While the cost of rammed earth is low, rammed-earth construction without mechanical tools is very time-consuming and laborious; however, with a mechanical tamper and prefabricated [[formwork]] it can require only two or three days to construct the walls of a {{convert|200|to|220|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} house.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

One significant benefit of rammed earth is its high [[thermal mass]]: like [[brick]] or [[concrete]], it can absorb heat during daytime and nocturnally release it.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This action moderates daily temperature variations and reduces the need for [[air conditioning]] and [[heating]]. In colder climates, rammed-earth walls can be insulated with [[Styrofoam]] or a similar insert. It must also be protected from heavy rain and insulated with vapour barriers.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthstructures.com.au/rammed-earth-construction/ |title=Rammed Earth Construction |work=Earth Structures |location=Victoria, Australia |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth can effectively regulate humidity if unclad walls containing clay are exposed to an internal space. Humidity is regulated between 40% and 60%, which is the ideal range for [[asthma]] sufferers{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} and for the storage of susceptible objects such as books.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The material mass and clay content of rammed earth allows an edifice to breathe more than concrete edifices, which avoids problems of condensation but prevents significant loss of heat.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Untouched, rammed-earth walls have the colour and texture of natural earth. Moisture-impermeable finishes, such as cement render, are avoided because they impair the ability of a wall to desorb moisture,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} which quality is necessary to preserve its strength.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Well-cured walls accept nails and screws easily, and can be effectively patched with the same material used to build them.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Blemishes can be repaired using the soil mixture as a plaster and sanded smooth.

The thickness, typically {{convert|30|to|35|cm|in}}, and [[density]] of rammed-earth walls make them suitable for [[soundproofing]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} They are also inherently [[fireproof]], resistant to [[termite]] damage, and non-toxic.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Environmental effects and sustainability ==

[[File:rammed earth.jpg|thumb|left|Rammed-earth [[trombe wall]] constructed by [[Design Build Bluff]]]]

Edifices of rammed earth are thought{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly than popular techniques of construction. Because rammed-earth edifices use locally available materials, they usually have low [[embodied energy]] and generate very little waste.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The soils used are typically [[subsoil]]s low in [[clay]], between 5% and 15%,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} which conserve the [[topsoil]] for agriculture. When the soil excavated in preparation for a foundation can be used, the cost and energy consumption of transportation are minimal.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; Rammed earth is probably the least environmentally detrimental construction material and technique that is readily and commercially available today to construct solid masonry edifices.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed earth has potentially low manufacturing impact, contingent on the amount of cement and the amount that is locally sourced; it is often quarried aggregates rather than "earth".

[[Formwork]] is removable and can be reused, reducing the need for lumber.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.networkearth.org/naturalbuilding/ceb.html |title=Natural Building Colloquium: Compressed Earth Blocks |first=Wayne |last=Nelson |publisher=NetWorks Productions |date=21 May 2003 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mixing cement with the soil can counteract sustainable benefits such as low embodied energy and humidity regulation because manufacture of the cement itself adds to the global carbon dioxide burden at a rate of 1.25 tonnes per tonne of cement produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rammedearthconsulting.com/rammed-earth-cement-co2.htm |title=Rammed Earth – Pollution and Cement |first=Rowland |last=Keable  |work=Rammed Earth Consulting |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial substitution of cement with alternatives such as [[ground granulated blast furnace slag]] has not been demonstrated to be effective, and implicates other questions of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm |title=Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |location=Washington, DC, USA |date=7 April 2011 |accessdate=4 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122083859/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm |archivedate=22 January 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth can contribute to the overall energy efficiency of edifices: the density, thickness, and thermal conductivity of rammed earth render it an especially suitable material for [[passive solar]] heating. Warmth requires almost 12 hours to be conducted through a wall {{convert|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Rammed-earth construction may also reduce the ecological impacts of [[deforestation]] and the toxicity of artificial materials associated with conventional construction techniques.

Although it has low [[greenhouse emission]]s in theory, [[transportation]] and the production of [[cement]] can add significantly to the overall emissions of modern rammed earth construction. The most basic kind of traditional rammed earth has very low greenhouse gas emissions but the more engineered and processed variant of rammed earth has the potential for significant emissions.

== History ==
[[File:JiayuguanWall.jpg|thumb|right|A ''taipa'' section of the [[Great Wall of China]]]]
[[File:Grange.Bassey.Saint.Nicolas.Macherin.jpg|thumb|right|Rammed-earth edifice on a farm in [[France]]]]

Evidence of ancient use of rammed earth has been found in [[Neolithic]] archaeological  sites of the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] cultures along the [[Yellow River]] in [[China]], dating to 5000 BCE. By 2000 BCE, rammed-earth architectural techniques (夯土 ''Hāng tǔ'') were commonly used for walls and foundations in [[China]].&lt;ref name="Xujie Liu"&gt;{{cite book |last=Xujie |first=Liu  |editor1-first=Nancy Shatzman |editor1-last=Steinhardt  |display-authors=etal  |title=Chinese Architecture |publisher=New Haven, CT, USA: Yale University Press and Beijing, China: New World Press |date=2002 |pages = 12–14, 21–2 |oclc=186413872 |isbn=978-0-300-09559-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s, rammed earth was popularized in the [[United States]] by the book ''Rural Economy'' by S. W. Johnson. The technique was used to construct the [[Borough House Plantation]]&lt;ref name="Borough House"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743001/ |title=National Register Properties in South Carolina: Borough House Plantation, Sumter County (SC Hwy 261, vicinity of Stateburg) |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, SC, USA |work=National Register Sites in South Carolina |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church of the Holy Cross (Stateburg, South Carolina)|Church of the Holy Cross]]&lt;ref name="Church of the Holy Cross"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743002/index.htm |title=National Register Properties in South Carolina: Church of the Holy Cross, Sumter County (SC Hwy 261, Stateburg vicinity) |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, South Carolina, USA |work=National Register Sites in South Carolina |date=April 20, 2009 |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Stateburg, South Carolina]], both being [[National Historic Landmarks]].

Johnson}}
An outstanding example of a rammed-earth edifice in [[Canada]] is [[St. Thomas Anglican Church (Shanty Bay, Ontario)|St. Thomas Anglican Church]] in [[Shanty Bay]], [[Ontario]], erected between 1838 and 1841.

From the 1920s through the 1940s rammed-earth construction in the US was studied. [[South Dakota State College]] extensively researched and constructed almost one hundred weathering walls of rammed earth.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} For over 30 years the college investigated the use of paints and plasters in relation to colloids in soil. In 1945, Clemson Agricultural College of [[South Carolina]] published the results of their research of rammed earth in a pamphlet titled "Rammed Earth Building Construction".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1936, on a homestead near [[Gardendale, Alabama]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] constructed an experimental community of rammed-earth edifices with architect Thomas Hibben.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The houses were inexpensively constructed and were sold to the public along with sufficient land for gardens and small plots for livestock. The project successfully provided valuable homes to low-income families.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

The [[US Agency for International Development]] is working with [[undeveloped countries]] to improve the engineering of rammed-earth houses.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} It also financed the authorship of the ''Handbook of Rammed Earth''&lt;ref name="Handbook For Building Homes of Earth"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wolfskill |first1=Lyle A. |last2=Dunlap |first2= Wayne A. |last3=Gallaway |first3=Bob M. |title=Handbook For Building Homes of Earth |url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAE689.pdf |publisher=[[Texas Transportation Institute]] |location=College Station, Texas, USA |work=Texas Transportation Institute bulletin |number=21 |edition=1453 |accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and the [[Texas Transportation Institute]]. The ''Handbook'' was unavailable for purchase by the public until the Rammed Earth Institute International gained permission to reprint it.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Interest in rammed earth declined after [[World War II]] when the cost of modern construction materials decreased.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed earth was considered substandard, and still is opposed by many contractors, engineers, and tradesmen who are unfamiliar with earthen construction techniques.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; The prevailing perception that such materials and techniques perform poorly in regions prone to earthquakes has prevented their use in much of the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In [[Chile]], for example, rammed earth edifices normally cannot be conventionally insured against damage or even be approved by the government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

A notable example of 21st century use of rammed earth is the façade of the [[Nk'Mip Desert Cultural Centre]] in southern [[British Columbia]], Canada. As of 2014 it is the largest rammed earth wall in [[North America]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8157">'''Rapoport's rule''' is an [[ecogeographical rule]] that states that [[latitude|latitudinal]] ranges of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s are generally smaller at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes.

==Background==

Stevens (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, G. C. (1989). ''The latitudinal gradients in geographical range: how so many species co-exist in the tropics''. American Naturalist 133, 240–256.&lt;/ref&gt; named the rule after [[Eduardo H. Rapoport]], who had earlier provided evidence for the phenomenon for subspecies of [[mammal]]s (Rapoport 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport, E. H. (1975). ''Areografía. Estrategias Geográficas de las Especies''. Fondo de Cultura Económica, México&lt;/ref&gt; 1982&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport, E. H. (1982). ''Areography. Geographical Strategies of Species''. Trad. B. Drausal, Pergamon Press, Oxford. {{ISBN|978-0-08-028914-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Stevens used the rule to "explain" greater species diversity in the tropics in the sense that [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]] and the rule have identical exceptional data and so must have the same underlying cause. Narrower ranges in the tropics would facilitate more species to coexist. He later extended the rule to altitudinal gradients, claiming that altitudinal ranges are greatest at greater altitudes (Stevens 1992&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, G. C. (1992). The elevational gradient in altitudinal range: an extension of Rapoport's latitudinal rule to altitude. American Naturalist 140, 893–911.&lt;/ref&gt;), and to depth gradients in the oceans (Stevens 1996&lt;ref name="Stevens1996"&gt;Stevens, G. C. (1996). Extending Rapoport's rule to Pacific marine fishes. Journal of Biogeography 23:149–154.&lt;/ref&gt;). The rule has been the focus of intense discussion and given much impetus to exploring distributional patterns of plants and animals. Stevens' original paper has been cited about 330 times in the scientific literature.

==Generality==

Support for the generality of the rule is at best equivocal.&lt;ref name="Rapoport;s rule: time 1996)"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01236-6 Gaston, K. J., Blackburn, T. M. and Spicer, J. I. (1998). Rapoport's rule: time for an epitaph? Trends in Ecology and Evolution 13, 70–74.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, marine teleost fishes have the greatest latitudinal ranges at low latitudes.&lt;ref name="Rohde1992"&gt;Rohde, K. (1992). Latitudinal gradients in species diversity: the search for the primary cause. Oikos 65, 514–527.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde1993"&gt;Rohde, K., Heap, M. and Heap, D. (1993). Rapoport's rule does not apply to marine teleosts and cannot explain latitudinal gradients in species richness. American Naturalist, 142, 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, freshwater fishes do show the trend, although only above a latitude of about 40 degrees North.&lt;ref name="Rohde1993"/&gt; Some subsequent  papers have found support for the rule, others, probably even more numerous, have found exceptions to it.&lt;ref name="Rapoport;s rule: time 1996)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. (1999). Latitudinal gradients in species diversity and Rapoport's rule revisited: a review of recent work, and what can parasites teach us about the causes of the gradients? Ecography, 22, 593–613&lt;/ref&gt; For most groups that have been shown to follow the rule, it is restricted to or at least most distinct above latitudes of about 40–50 degrees. Rohde therefore concluded that the rule describes a local phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Rohde1996"&gt;Rohde, K. (1996). Rapoport's Rule is a local phenomenon and cannot explainlatitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity Letters, 3, 10–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer simulations using the [[Chowdhury Ecosystem Model]] did not find support for the rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.thbio.2006.01.002 Stauffer, D., and Rohde, K., 2006. Simulation of Rapoport's rule for latitudinal species spread. Theory in Bioscioences 125(1): 55–65.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==

Rohde (1996)&lt;ref name="Rohde1996"/&gt; explained the fact that the rule is restricted to very high latitudes by effects of glaciations which have wiped out species with narrow ranges, a view also expressed by Brown (1995).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. H. (1995). Macroecology. University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; Another explanation of Rapoport's rule is the "climatic variability" or "seasonal variability hypothesis".&lt;ref name="Stevens1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letcher, A. J., and [[Paul H. Harvey|Harvey, P. H.]] (1994) Variation in geographical range size among mammals of the Palearctic. American Naturalist 144:30–42.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this hypothesis, seasonal variability selects for greater climatic tolerances and therefore wider latitudinal ranges (see also Fernandez and Vrba  2005&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez, M. H. and Vrba, E. S. (2005). Rapoport effect and biomic specialization in African mammals: revisiting the climatic variability hypothesis. Journal of Biogeography 32, 903–918.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Methods used to demonstrate the rule==

The methods used to demonstrate the rule have been subject to some controversy. Most commonly, authors plot means of latitudinal ranges in a particular 5° latitudinal band against latitude, although modal or median ranges have been used by some.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, K., Jablonski, D. and Valentine, J. W. (1994). Eastern Pacific molluscan provinces and latitudinal diversity gradients: no evidence for Rapoport's rule. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA 91, 88.71–8874.&lt;/ref&gt; In the original paper by Stevens, all species occurring in each band were counted, i.e., a species with a range of 50 degrees occurs in 10 or 11 bands. However, this may lead to an artificial inflation of latitudinal ranges of species occurring at high latitudes, because even a few tropical species with wide ranges will affect the means of ranges at high latitudes, whereas the opposite effect due to high latitude species extending into the tropics is negligible: species diversity is much smaller at high than low latitudes. As an alternative method the "midpoint method" has been proposed, which avoids this problem. It counts only those species with the midpoint of their ranges in a particular latitudinal band.&lt;ref name="Rohde1993"/&gt;  An additional complication in assessing Rapoport's rule for data based on field sampling is the possibility of a spurious pattern driven by a sample-size artifact. Equal sampling effort at species-rich and species-poor localities tends to underestimate range size at the richer localities relative to the poorer, when in fact range sizes might not differ among localities.&lt;ref name="ColwellHurtt 1994"&gt;Colwell, R. K., and G. C. Hurtt. (1994). Nonbiological gradients in species richness and a spurious Rapoport effect. American Naturalist 144:570–595.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biotic and abiotic factors which act against the rule==

Marine benthic invertebrates and some parasites have been shown to have smaller dispersal abilities in cold seas ([[Thorson's rule]]), which would counteract Rapoport's rule. The tropics have far more uniform temperatures over a far wider latitudinal range (about 45 degrees) than high latitude species. As temperature is one of the most important (if not the most important) factor determining geographical distribution, wider latitudinal ranges in the tropics might therefore be expected.

==Evolutionary age==

The inconsistent results concerning Rapoport's rule suggest that certain characteristics of species may be responsible for their different latitudinal ranges.  These characteristics may include, for example, their evolutionary age: species that have evolved recently in the tropics may have small latitudinal ranges because they have not had the time to spread far from their origin, whereas older species have extended their ranges.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. (1998). Latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Area matters, but how much? Oikos 82, 184–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Re-amping''' is a process often used in [[multitrack recording]] in which a recorded signal is routed back out of the editing environment and run through external processing using [[effects unit]]s and then into a [[guitar amplifier]] and a guitar speaker cabinet or a [[reverb]] chamber. Originally, the technique was used mostly for [[electric guitar]]s: it facilitates a separation of guitar playing from [[guitar amplifier]] processing—a previously recorded audio program is played back and re-recorded at a later time for the purpose of adding effects, ambiance such as reverb or echo, and the tone shaping imbued by certain amps and cabinets. The technique has since evolved over the 2000s to include many other applications. Re-amping can also be applied to other instruments and program, such as recorded drums, synthesizers, and [[Software synthesizer|virtual instruments]].

Examples of common re-amping objectives include taking a pre-recorded electric guitar track and adding musically pleasing amplifier [[distortion (music)|distortion/overdrive]], room tone such as [[reverb]], [[Dynamic range compression|audio compression]], EQ/filters, [[envelope follower]]s, resonance, and gating. Re-amping is often used to "warm up" dry tracks, which often means adding complex, musically interesting effects. By playing a dry signal through a studio's main monitors and then using room mics to capture the ambiance, engineers are able to create realistic reverbs and blend the "wet" (modified) signal with the original dry recorded sound to achieve the desired amount of depth.

The technique is especially useful for "softening" stereo drum tracks. By pointing the monitors away from each other and miking each speaker individually, the stereo image can be well preserved and a new sense of "depth" can be added to the track. It is important for [[audio engineer]]s to check that the microphones being used are in [[phase (waves)|phase]] to avoid problems with the mix.

== Example ==

An electric guitarist records a dry, unprocessed, unaffected track in a recording studio. This is often achieved by connecting the guitar into a [[DI unit]] (a Direct Input or Direct Inject buffer box) that is fed to a recording console or, alternatively, bypassing the console by using an outboard preamplifier. Often, the guitarist's signal is sent to both recorder and guitar amp simultaneously, providing the guitarist with a proper amplifier "feel" while she/he is playing while also tracking (recording) a dry (un-effects processed) signal.

At a later time, ranging from weeks or months later to even years later, the dry, direct, unprocessed guitar recording is fed to a bridging device (a Reamp unit or reverse DI box) to "re-record" the guitarist's unprocessed performance through a dedicated guitar amplifier cabinet and/or external effects units. The guitar amplifier is placed in the live room or isolation booth of the [[recording studio]] and is set up to produce the desired tonal quality, including distortion character and room reverberation. A microphone is placed near the guitar speaker and a new track is recorded, producing the re-amplified, processed track. The microphone cable is connected to the mixing console or mic preamp using a cable, as usual, without using a bridging device.

External effects such as stomp boxes and guitar [[multi-fx]] processors can also be included in the re-amping process.  As well as physical devices that require an impedance-matched guitar pickup signal, software-based virtual guitar effects and amps can be included in the re-amping process.

== Advantages of re-amping ==

Re-amping allows guitarists and other electronic musicians to record their tracks and go home, leaving the engineer and producer to spend more time dialing in "just right" settings and effects on prerecorded tracks. When re-amping electric guitar tracks, the guitarist need not be present for the engineer to experiment long hours with a range of effects, mic positions, speaker cabinets, amplifiers, effects pedals, and overall tonality – continuously replaying the prerecorded tracks while experimenting with new settings and tones. When a desired tone is finally achieved, the guitarist's dry performance is re-recorded, or "re-amped," with all added effects.

Manufacturers of instrument processing gear such as guitar effects, or equipment reviewers, can gather a library of dry performance tracks, performed and edited well, and then run these ideal tracks through the processing gear to demonstrate the sounds that the processing gear can produce.  An unlimited number of performance playback passes, including looping, enables trying out many combinations of settings quickly, including microphone techniques. When guitar amp or amp simulator designers try various circuit component values or settings, they can use the dry tracks as prepared, always-available input test signals, and consistent reference signals.

Another advantage of re-amping is that it enables producers and band members to have more options for remixing and redoing a recording a long time after the original recording. If the original recording of a song with electric guitar is done in 1985, and the electric guitarist's sound was only recorded with a mic in front of her/his combo amp or speaker cabinet, the recording will lock in the specific type of distortion, reverb, flanger processing and other effects that were used, which might sound "dated" several decades later. A producer who is tasked with doing a remix of this song 30 years later cannot "undo" or remove the distortion, reverb, chorus or flanger effects, and so there are limited options for remixing the guitar sound. On the other hand, if the engineering and production team in 1985 had simultaneously tracked (recorded) a "dry", DI out signal from the electric guitar's pickups, a producer remixing the song 30 years later could take the dry guitar signal and re-amp it through 2000s-era digital effects and speaker systems, giving a new sound to this 1985 track.

== Electronic interfacing ==
{{Main|DI box}}
''Direct inject'' (DI) is a device for connecting an unbalanced, high-impedance, low-level signal (commonly a guitar pickup's signal) into audio equipment designed for a low-impedance balanced signal (such as a [[Digital audio workstation|DAW]]) or [[audio console]]s. ''Reverse-DI'' means running this same device or technique in reverse – connecting a high-level (typically balanced, low-impedance) signal into audio equipment that was designed for low-level, unbalanced, high-impedance signals, such as a guitar amplifier.

Playing back a signal from recording studio equipment directly into a guitar amplifier can cause unwanted side-effects such as input-stage distortion, treble loss or overemphasis, and ground-loop hum; thus there is sometimes a need for [[Impedance matching|impedance conversion]], level-matching, and ground alteration. Like running a guitar signal through a guitar effects pedal that is set to Bypass, re-amping introduces some degree of sonic degradation compared to playing a guitar live directly into a guitar amp rig.

A re-amping device commonly employs a reversed Direct Inject (DI) transformer with some resistors added for level and impedance shift. Level and impedance adjustment can be achieved by adding a potentiometer or adjustable resistor. A proper re-amping device converts a balanced signal to an unbalanced signal, reduces a high studio-level (line-level) signal down to a low guitar-level signal, and shifts the output to a high instrument-level impedance (typically a guitar pickup impedance).

In conventional re-amplification, a dry recorded signal is sent into a balanced XLR input. An unbalanced ¼" (Tip-Sleeve) phone connector is typically used for the output, which is connected to the guitar amp rig. Some re-amping devices offer a pad (attenuator) switch to reduce a too-hot output level. Sometimes a [[guitar effects|guitar volume pedal]] or buffered [[effects pedal]] can work adequately for re-amping, depending on grounding, levels, and impedance. Another approach to simulating the high impedance of a guitar pickup is to use a passive DI and add a 10 K-ohm resistor in series with the signal connection inside a 1/4" plug.

== Terminology ==

While "reverse DI" re-recording techniques have been used for decades, the process was popularized in part by the introduction of the Reamp device in 1993. The registered trademark "Reamp" describes a patented invention ({{US patent|6005950}}) filed in 1994 by audio engineer [[John Cuniberti]], perhaps best known for his lifelong engineering work with guitarist [[Joe Satriani]]. The Reamp inductively couples balanced line-level sources into unbalanced guitar-level destinations (e.g., DAW output to guitar amp input) and includes a potentiometer which alters both signal level and source impedance. Derivations of the Reamp trademark, such as "reamping" and "re-amplification," have become common terminology in professional audio to describe the process of amplified re-recording – much like the word "Band-aid" is often used to describe adhesive bandages (see [[Genericized trademark]]).

== History ==

The process of re-recording has been used throughout the history of recording studios. [[Pierre Schaeffer]] in the 1930s and 1940s used recorded sounds, such as trains, and played them back with ambient alteration, re-recording the net result. [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] and [[Edgard Varèse]] later used similar techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Dilberto, John. [http://emusician.com/em_spotlight/Pioneers_Sampling/ Pierre Schaeffer &amp; Pierre Henry: Pioneers in Sampling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207081234/http://emusician.com/em_spotlight/Pioneers_Sampling/ |date=2009-12-07 }}. Electronic Musician Magazine, June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Les Paul]] and [[Mary Ford]] recorded layered vocal harmonies and guitar parts, modifying prior tracks with effects such as ambient reverb while recording the net result together on a new track. Les Paul placed a loudspeaker at one end of a tunnel and a microphone at the other end. The loudspeaker played back previously recorded material - the microphone recorded the resulting altered sound.

[[Roger Nichols (recording engineer)|Roger Nichols]] claims to have used a guitar re-recording process (not reverse DI) in 1968, partly to spread the stress on cranked tube amps across multiple amps, one at a time. A sound would be dialed-in for several hours on one cranked guitar amplifier, and if this stress audibly wore down the amplifier components, another amplifier would be used to record the remaining work. It has been noted that [[Phil Spector]], re-mixing the original Beatles’ ''[[Let It Be]]'' master tapes in 1970, may have re-recorded dry electric guitar program through a guitar amplifier.

Film sound re-recording is a time-honored practice. Sound designer [[Walter Murch]] is known for a technique called "worldizing" in which "real world" ambiance is added, via re-recording, to dry recorded program. Sound designer [[Nick Peck]] describes the worldizing process: "Place a speaker in a room or location with the desired aural fingerprint and position a microphone some distance from the speaker. Next, play back your original sounds through the speaker and re-record them on another recorder, capturing the sound with all the reverberant characteristics of the space. This requires much time and effort, but when only the most authentic reproduction will do, worldizing can get you there."&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Nick. [Worldizing http://www.filmsound.org/terminology/worldizing.htm]  Filmsound.org (date unknown)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal ==

Radial and Millennia Media products use the Reamp patent, or a variant of the patent, under license. The Reamp Company acknowledges that words such as "reamping" have become generic/colloquial audio expressions, but asserts that the word ''Reamp'' remains their legally registered trademark. In late 2010 Recording engineer John Cuniberti announced the sale of his Reamp patent, trademark and all business assets to Vancouver, Canada-based Radial Engineering Ltd., a leading manufacturer of products used by audio professionals and musicians around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radialeng.com/reamp-history.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the [[Simulacra and Simulation|three order simulacra]], the '''second-order simulacra''', a term coined by [[Jean Baudrillard]], are [[symbol]]s of a non faithful representation to the original. Here, signs and images do not faithfully show us reality, but might hint at the existence of something real which the sign itself is incapable of encapsulating.&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard 1994 [1981], Simulacra and Simulation, University of Michigan Press, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

While the first-order simulacra is a faithful copy to the original and the third order are symbols that have become without referents, that is, symbols with no real object to represent but pretends to be a faithful copy of an original. Simply put, a third-order simulacra are symbols in themselves taken for reality and further layer of [[symbol]]ism is added. This occurs when the symbol is taken to be more important or authoritative of the original entity, authenticity has been replaced by copy (thus reality is replaced by a substitute).

The consequence of the propagation of second-order [[simulacra]] is that, within the affected context, nothing is "real," though those engaged in the illusion are incapable of seeing it. Instead of having experiences, people observe spectacles, via real or [[metaphor]]ical control screens. Instead of the real, we have simulation and simulacra, the [[Hyperreality|hyperreal]].

In his essay "The Precession of the Simulacra," Baudrillard recalls a tale from a short story by [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]] in which a king requests a map (i.e. a symbol) to be produced so detailed that it ends up coming into one-to-one correspondence with the territory (i.e. the real area the map is to represent); this references the philosophical concept of [[map–territory relation]]. Baudrillard argues that in the [[postmodern]] epoch, the territory ceases to exist, and there is nothing left but the map; or indeed, the very concepts of the map and the territory have become indistinguishable, the distinction which once existed between them having been erased.

Among the many issues associated with the propagation of second-order simulacra to the third-order is what Baudrillard considers the termination of history. The method of this termination comes through the lack of oppositional elements in society, with the mass having become "the [[silent majority]]," an imploded concept which absorbs images passively, becoming itself a media overwritten by those who speak for it (i.e. the people are symbolically represented by governing agents and market statistic, marginalizing the people themselves). For Baudrillard this is the natural result of an ethic of unity in which actually agonistic opposites are taken to be essentially the same. For example, Baudrillard contends that [[moral universalism]] (human rights, equality) is equated with [[globalization]], which is not concerned with immutable values but with mediums of exchange and equalisation such as the global market and [[mass media]].

A '''showroom''' is a large space used to display products or show entertainment.

==Marketing location==
[[Image:Concesionario de Mercedes-Benz, Múnich, Alemania, 2013-03-30, DD 25.JPG|thumb|right|[[Car dealership]] showroom]]
[[File:-01 Kartel showrooms.jpg |thumb|right|[[Kartell]] showroom in  Via Turati, [[Milan]], [[Italy]]]]
A showroom is a large space used to display products for sale, such as [[automotive showroom|automobiles]], [[furniture]], [[Home appliance|appliances]], [[carpet]] or [[apparel]]. It is a [[retail store]] of a company in which products are on sale in a space created by their brand or company. A showroom can also be a space for wholesale buyers to view fashion merchandise for sale in their retail stores.

The world's most famous locations for a showroom, generally in the form of a [[business cluster|cluster]], are the [[Champs Elysees]] in Paris or [[Merchandise Mart]] in Chicago,{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

One of the world's largest showrooms is the {{convert|35000|m2}} BMW showroom in Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;Horatiu Boeriu, ''[http://www.bmwblog.com/2012/02/21/bmw-opens-largest-showroom-worldwide-in-abu-dhabi/ BMW opens largest showroom worldwide in Abu Dhabi]'', BMW blog, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carscoops, ''[http://www.carscoops.com/2012/02/world-largest-bmw-showroom-opens-in-abu.html World's Largest BMW Showroom Opens in Abu Dhabi, Best Selling Model in the M.E. is the 7-Series]'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest collection of showrooms is a {{convert|216000|m2|sing=on}} car showroom in [[Istanbul]] called [[Autopia Europia]].&lt;ref&gt;World Buildings Directory, ''[http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=3023 Autopia Europia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419012922/http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=3023 |date=2014-04-19 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mibz.com, [http://www.mibz.com/tag/worlds-biggest-showroom Autopia Europia, The World’s Biggest Car Dealership, Will Have A Circuit On The Roof] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419025632/http://www.mibz.com/tag/worlds-biggest-showroom |date=2014-04-19 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment venue==
A showroom is a permanent enclosed space used to present a [[performance]].  Sometimes it is customized for a particular show; for example, the [[Las Vegas Hilton]] showroom used for the [[rock opera]] ''[[Starlight Express]]'' was customized by pouring [[concrete]] ramps onto its stage area and in the seating area.

Some showrooms are used daily, while others are only used when a performer is booked to perform. In some cases, a showroom is [[lease]]d to a performer, who then retains all income rather than being paid by the showroom owner.

== Temporary showroom ==
In fashion capitals such as [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[Milan]] or [[London]] one can find temporary showrooms. 
These places can be rented on a daily or weekly basis. Some temporary showrooms are managed with the help of [[event management]] agencies. Temporary showrooms can also be [[Pop-up retail|pop-up stores]], which are short-term sales spaces.

==Augmented reality showroom==
Automobile manufacturer [[Ferrari]] has recently introduced [[augmented reality]] technology into their showrooms, to provide customers with a more hands-on approach when purchasing a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autoblog.com/2015/04/15/ferrari-augmented-reality-showroom-video/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Founding===
[[Lalith Athulathmudali]] originally acquired the 25 acre land where SLIIT stands today in the 1980s in the expectation of building a Technological University and the headquarters of the [[Mahapola Trust Fund]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Minister of Commerce [[Kingsley Wickramaratne]] and [[Richard Pathirana]] would eventually use the land for establishing SLIIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adhikari|first=Deepthi Pramitha|title=Mahapola &amp; SLIIT|url=http://www.divaina.com/2016/08/07/feature17.html|accessdate=9 December 2016|newspaper=Divaina|date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology was established in 1999 by incorporation under the Companies Act of 2007 as a [[nonprofit]] company by guarantee (registration number GL 24) with the ability to award [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees following amendments to the Universities Act the same year, thus gaining recognition from the [[University Grants Commission of Sri Lanka|University Grants Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.documents.gov.lk/files/egz/2016/2/1955-20_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.drc.gov.lk/App/comreg.nsf/pageS?OpenPage&amp;Start=17500 |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009150649/http://www.drc.gov.lk/App/comreg.nsf/pageS?OpenPage&amp;Start=17500 |archive-date=9 October 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.documents.gov.lk/files/egz/2012/11/1785-22_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; SLIIT was established primarily to educate and train information technology professionals.

===Expansions===
Initially limited to the fields of information technology and computing, in 2007 SLIIT  expanding into new fields of study. These include [[electronic engineering]] and [[Business|business management]] in collaboration with [[Sheffield Hallam University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itpro.lk/node/1109 SLIIT offers UK recognised BBA Degrees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125215421/http://itpro.lk/node/1109 |date=25 November 2010 }}, ITpro.lk&lt;/ref&gt; SLIIT also expanded its presence from [[Colombo]] and its suburbs to other parts of the country, by establishing centres in [[Kandy]] and [[Matara, Sri Lanka|Matara]], making SLIIT accessible in six locations. Presently, SLIIT operates two campuses - the Colombo Metropolitan Campus at Kollupitiya, and the Malabe Campus, with centres in Matara, Kandy, Jaffna and Kurunegala with an undergraduate student population of over 7,000. A further 1,000 students follow master's degree Programmes, Postgraduate Diploma and other Professional Development Programmes.

In 2011, SLIIT established its faculty of business after it was accredited by the UGC to award [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] degrees in [[Human Capital Management]], [[Accounting]] and [[Finance]], [[Marketing management|Marketing Management]], [[Quality Management|Quality management]] and [[Management Information System]]s.

This was following in 2012, with the establishment of the Colombo Academy of Hospitality Management (CAHM); the first internationally recognised school for tourism and hospitality management in Sri Lanka. The project is a joint venture of SLIIT, Colombo Academy of Hospitality Management (CAHM),&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;[http://www.cahm.lk Colombo Academy of Hospitality Management]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Angliss Institute of TAFE|William Angliss Institute]] of Australia. It has been developed in line with international standards, housing a multi-use training kitchen, a full-scale banqueting facility, training restaurant, model bedrooms, an IT training centre and team rooms for students' practical training to prepare students for the degree of Bachelor of Tourism and Hospitality Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Globally recognised Hospitality Management degree now offered for the first time in Sri Lanka at SLIIT |url=http://www.sliit.lk/news/globally-recognised-hospitality-management-degree-now-offered-for-the-first-time-in-sri-lanka-at-sliit/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=History of SLIIT|url=http://www.sliit.lk/history-sliit/|accessdate=2 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502081130/http://www.sliit.lk/history-sliit/|archive-date=2 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The faculty of engineering was formed in 2013, with it awarding its own [[Bachelor of Science in Engineering]] degrees and master's degrees from partner universities such as [[Curtin University]] and [[Sheffield Hallam University]].&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;{{cite journal|title=THE UNIVERSITIES ACT, No. 16 OF 1978|journal=The Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka|date=21 November 2012|issue=1785/22|url=http://documents.gov.lk/Extgzt/2012/PDF/Nov/1785_22/1785_22%20(E).pdf|accessdate=2 June 2015}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SLIIT Computing was established as a privately managed subsidiary of SLIIT in [[Kollupitiya]] to further expand undergraduate studies. In 2015, SLIIT established its School of Architecture, offering a three-year degree in architecture.

'''''Staying with the Trouble: Making Kin in the Chthulucene''''' is a 2016 book by [[Donna Haraway]], published by [[Duke University Press]]. In it, Haraway offers "making kin" as a way to consider multiple species and interact in a multiple species world. 

By emphasizing connectedness, ''Staying with the Trouble'' can be thought of as a continuation of major themes from "[[A Cyborg Manifesto]]" and ''[[The Companion Species Manifesto]]''. Haraway's book can also be thought of as a critique of the [[Anthropocene]] as a way of making sense of the present, de-emphasizing human exceptionalism in favor of multispecism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thechart.me/book-review-donna-haraway-staying-with-the-trouble/|title=Book Review: Donna Haraway’s Staying with the Trouble|date=2017-06-21|work=The Chart|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Suffering of God: An Old Testament Perspective''''' is a book by Old Testament scholar [[Terence E. Fretheim]].  In 1984 it appeared as number 14 in the Overtures to Biblical Theology series published by [[Fortress Press]].

== Summary and review ==

Most Christians believe the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] of God is an exclusively [[New Testament]] idea, but in ''The Suffering of God: An Old Testament Perspective'', Terence E. Fretheim argues that incarnation has always been God's standard method of interaction with humanity.  Through exegesis and a [[Literary criticism|literary]] and philosophical [[Hermeneutics|approach to Scripture]], Fretheim draws the elusive [[Yahweh|God of the Old Testament]] close.  Indeed, the author seeks to balance the common images of God as wrathful [[Last Judgment|judge]] or cold [[Divine law|lawgiver]] with an image of God in relationship with humanity.  According to Fretheim, God suffers because He has completely and intimately bound Himself in relation to the created world, especially [[Chosen people|His people Israel]].

Fretheim defends his thesis by claiming that "[[metaphor]]s matter" and appealing to biblical images of an [[Immanence|immanent deity]].   For him, the most significant metaphors for God in the Old Testament are [[anthropomorphic]].  If man is created in the [[image of God]], he argues, then we have "permission to reverse the process and, by looking at the human, learn what God is like" (p.&amp;nbsp;11).  The human metaphor is presented as the dominant expression of God's nature and character.  The author says that many aspects of humanity are not appropriate for describing God.  [[Human sexuality|Sexuality]], [[death]], [[sinfulness]], etc. are aspects of human nature that should not be ascribed to God.  These "ungodly" aspects of humanity have moved some Christians to dismiss anthropomorphic descriptions of God out of hand, but Fretheim argues that the human metaphor is so pervasive and appropriate that it acts as a sort of guide, directing the reader as to the proper way to understand all non-human metaphors.

The human metaphor has been long neglected in Fretheim's opinion, but he sees [[feminist theology]], [[Liberation theology|liberation]] / [[Black theology]], and the [[Holocaust theology|theological response to catastrophic events]] of the twentieth century as positive responses to this neglect.  The problem, he says, is that too many theologians are doing their own exegesis, and they are bringing ideas to the text which cannot be supported.  He argues that [[Biblical studies|biblical scholars]], biased by their theology, have largely ignored texts concerning God's [[repentance]], downplayed anthropomorphic descriptions of God, and misunderstood issues relating to [[divine foreknowledge]].  Fretheim believes that an unbiased view will be more pluralistic and more willing to incorporate the relational aspects of the Old Testament God.

=== Summary ===

The first traditional view that Fretheim seeks to undermine, or perhaps more accurately to bring balance to, is the idea of [[divine transcendence]].  He argues that both the monarchical and organismic views are present in scripture, but that the organismic, [[Immanence|immanent]] image is dominant.  This “relationship of reciprocity” (p.&amp;nbsp;35) between God and the world is the foundation for all of Fretheim's conclusions.   God affects and is affected by the world He has created, and this relationship is key to understanding what kind of God He is.

The second widely held position that Fretheim challenges is the doctrine of divine [[omniscience]]. (chapter 4) Fretheim uses solid biblical exegesis to argue compellingly against a view (at least in the Old Testament) which classifies omniscience as one of God's fundamental characteristics. Divine foreknowledge, he believes, is limited because of God's relationship with creation.  There is no doubt, he says, that God always knows what He will do in the future, but He does not always know what free moral agents outside of Himself will do.  For Fretheim, the widespread use of  words like “perhaps” and “if” in divine speech point to a lack of certainty in God's mind about the future.  God's bargain with Abraham over Sodom is an excellent example of God's mind being open to change depending on the unforeseen actions of human beings.  The issue of foreknowledge is not presented as complex or difficult.  Rather, Fretheim quickly lays out his argument and in less than fifteen pages and moves on to the addresses the issue of [[Divine presence|God's presence]] in the world. (chapter 5) While acknowledging that God is everywhere at all times in a structural or general presence, Fretheim describes what he calls, the “intensification of the divine presence.”  This intensity of presence can be affected positively or negatively by human beings.  Fretheim argues that [[sin]] drives away God (as in Ezekiel 8:6) and actually results in the intensification of divine presence in the form of [[Divine wrath|God's wrath]].  Conversely, [[righteousness]] or “[[receptiveness]]” can move God to draw near.

The most intense experience of God's presence occurs in the form of [[theophany]].  In what is probably Fretheim's most controversial chapter (chapter 6), he describes the appearances of God in the Old Testament and the human reaction to them.  To Fretheim, the spoken word delivered by God is no more important than the appearance itself, the visible word, as he calls it.  He suggests that modern theologians need to broaden their understanding of the Word of God to include the visual aspects of revelation as well as the spoken/written word.
Fretheim makes a thorough examination of several different Old Testament theophanies noting their similarities and differences before coming to his surprising conclusion:  All theophanies involve God taking on human form (chapter 6).  Theologically, this is key for Fretheim.  The consistent use of human form shows God's [[vulnerability]].  It proves that there is nothing fundamentally ungodly about the human form, and it shows that “the finite form is capable of the infinite.” (p.&amp;nbsp;102)  In wrestling with the theological implications of such a statement, Fretheim questions whether God uses the human form for the sake of appearances or whether there is a fundamental continuity between the two.  Not surprisingly, he argues for the latter position, and from the argument establishes that God is fundamentally connected to His creation and that He is fundamentally vulnerable because of this relationship.  This leads to his actual discussion of the suffering of God.

In three short chapters Fretheim describes God as suffering because of His creation (chapter 7), for His creation (chapter 8), and with His creation (chapter 9) .  These chapters flow logically out of the groundwork established in the first one hundred pages of the text.  Each chapter is neatly summarized in numbered points making it easy to review and synthesize.
The final chapter of Fretheim's book deals with the special relationship between the suffering God and His suffering servants, [[the prophets]].  In men like [[Jeremiah]], the [[Logos (Christianity)|divine word]] is incarnated to the point that the prophet shares in the divine suffering and God shares in the prophets suffering. The lives of the prophets are tied up in the [[Affective Theology|divine life]] to the point that they embody the word of God in their lives as well as their words.  The [[suffering servant]] in Isaiah experiences the same phenomenon as prophets like [[Moses]] and Jeremiah, but in him, Fretheim sees another level intensification of presence.  Despite his strong claims about the shared suffering of the prophets and God, Fretheim acknowledges that in the Old Testament God Himself did not become completely incarnate in an entire human life.  That act is reserved for the [[incarnation of Jesus Christ]], but Fretheim sees it, not as something radically new, but as “the culmination of a long-standing relationship of God with the world that is much more widespread in the OT than is commonly recognized.”

Fretheim's work is incredibly successful at accomplishing its stated purpose of bringing balance to the church's image of God in the Old Testament.  He powerfully synthesizes the work of feminist, liberation, and [[process theologian]]s while relying firmly on his expertise as a biblical exegete.   The real strength of this work is that Fretheim manages to make many of the same critiques common to these movements without sounding like a feminist or a liberation theologian.  While he acknowledges their influence on him, the author's tone and focus remain overtly biblical throughout the book.

Fretheim brings an air of authority and experience in the task of exegesis that is missing in the works of [[systematic theologian]]s addressing the same issues.   Influences like [[Abraham Heschel]] help him keep Christian bias to a minimum when approaching the Old Testament text.   Furthermore, he does not limit himself to one or two proof texts to support his position.  On the contrary, I found myself flipping through my Bible constantly while reading his work.  He challenges the reader to draw theology from the biblical text rather than to allow our preconceived ideas about God to distort our reading of the Old Testament.
Fretheim's book is a marvelous example of [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] logical organization and rational approach to a complex topic.  His argument is well-formed and easy to follow.  The reader may be confused as to why a book called ''The Suffering of God'' takes over one hundred pages to actually discuss any pain endured by the deity, but Fretheim is not rushed into embracing a position before laying the biblical and philosophical groundwork necessary to support that position.   Indeed, laying the foundation is the difficult part.  After chapter six, the reader already anticipates the conclusion.

The author is conversant with a wide range of modern scholarship as evidenced by his excellent endnotes and bibliography.   The relative brevity of the book is amazing considering the wide range of topics addressed.  Here again, Fretheim's organizational skills are at work.  When a related but unessential issue arises, he usually adds a note to refer the reader to good sources on the topic and continues on without interrupting his argument.
One of the nicest things about this work is its energetic and engaging style.  Fretheim hopes this book will change the church's view of God in the Old Testament, and readability is essential to influencing preachers and teachers within churches.  The provocative nature of the topic and Fretheim's willingness to make bold claims leads the reader into dialogue with the text.  Ward characterizes it as “bold and challenging, inviting vigorous response,” saying that the margins of his review copy are “filled with comments”   While the content is too technical for direct use in most [[church congregation|church settings]], the ideas that Fretheim lays out can easily be transferred to a [[sermon]] or [[Sunday School|Bible class]].  Certainly, The Suffering of God is not a popular level book, but it is also not so technical as to exclude ministers or [[seminary]] students from its audience.

=== Critiques ===
While reviews have been very positive, they have raised three serious critiques of the work.  First, in his effort to emphasize the imminent and relational nature of God, Fretheim neglects to adequately address themes like [[holy|holiness]] as a balance to his relational theology.  Without the tension provided by God's holiness, relational theology can be pushed too far, and Fretheim sometimes is guilty of this.   [[Dale Patrick]] points out that while Fretheim does not deny that much of the God-talk in the Old Testament does fit into the traditional paradigms which emphasize holiness, [[sovereignty]], and transcendence he ignores these elements claiming that the organismic is predominant.  Patrick argues that the task of biblical theology is to present a comprehensive image of God rather than simply a prominent one.   Some have claimed that Fretheim's process theology (a term Fretheim himself never embraces) is to blame for the lack of material on holiness.   However, given Fretheim's presupposition that transcendence and sovereignty have been overemphasized, it is easy to see why he doesn’t spend time affirming them.  His stated goal is not to replace ideas of holiness, but to bring balance to them.
As previously stated, Fretheim uses a wide variety of texts to support his position, but the vast majority of these come from the [[Psalms]] and the prophetic literature.  As Elizabeth Bellefontaine notes, Israel's [[wisdom literature|wisdom traditions]] are conspicuously absent.   Despite his heavy criticism of those who “remove certain materials from the OT theological repertoire” for the purposes of theological convergence (p.&amp;nbsp;20), Fretheim himself offers a nod to the [[wisdom literature]] and then completely ignores it.  This would be less relevant were it not for the fact that much of the wisdom literature stands in tension if not opposition to his own theology.

While Fretheim's catch phrase, “Metaphors matter,” can be universally affirmed, he is sometimes guilty of thinking that they matter too much.  This leads him at time to engage in an overly literal reading of scripture.  Metaphors reveal God to us, but they are not God himself.  “The modern interpreter’s challenge, which is not adequately confronted in this book, is to discern how the Old Testament understood its metaphors.”    He overstates his case when discussing incarnational metaphor and [[theodicy]].   White says, “There is no need for Fretheim to argue (as he does) that all theophanies were in human form in order to substantiate the interrelationship between theophanic motif and the prophet.” Saying that a human figure can be inferred within the [[pillar of cloud]] or the [[burning bush]] (p.&amp;nbsp;94–95) is speculative at best, and Fretheim doesn’t need it to advance his argument.

In automata theory, a '''tree''' is a particular way of representing a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree structure]] as sequences of natural numbers. 
[[File:An example of infinite tree structure.png|thumb|500px|alt=The graphic illustration of the example labeled tree|Graphic illustration of the labeled tree described in the example]]
For example, each node of the tree is a [[Formal language#Words over an alphabet|word]] over set of [[natural numbers]] (ℕ), which helps this definition to be used in [[automata theory]].

A '''tree''' is a set ''T'' ⊆ ℕ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; such that if ''t''.''c'' ∈ ''T'', with ''t'' ∈ ℕ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and ''c'' ∈ ℕ, then ''t'' ∈ ''T'' and ''t''.''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''T'' for all 0 ≤ ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''c''. The elements of ''T'' are known as '''nodes''', and the empty word ε is the (single) '''root''' of ''T''. For every ''t'' ∈ ''T'', the element ''t''.''c'' ∈ ''T'' is a '''successor''' of ''t'' in '''direction''' ''c''. The number of successors of ''t'' is called its '''degree''' or '''arity''', and represented as ''d''(''t''). A node is a '''leaf''' if it has no successors. If every node of a tree has finitely many successors, then it is called a '''finitely''', otherwise an '''infinitely branching''' tree. A '''path''' π is a subset of ''T'' such that ε ∈ π and for every ''t'' ∈ ''T'', either ''t'' is a leaf or there exists a unique ''c'' ∈ ℕ such that ''t''.''c'' ∈ π. A path may be a finite or infinite set. If all paths of a tree are finite then the tree is called finite, otherwise infinite. A tree is called '''fully infinite''' if all its paths are infinite. Given an [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] Σ, a '''Σ-labeled tree''' is a pair (''T'',''V''), where ''T'' is a tree and ''V'': ''T'' → Σ maps each node of ''T'' to a symbol in Σ. A labeled tree formally defines a commonly used [[term (logic)|term]] tree structure. A set of labeled trees is called a '''tree language'''.

A tree is called '''ordered''' if there is an order among the successors of each of its nodes. The above definition of tree naturally suggests an order among the successors, which can be used to make the tree ranked. 

In the case of [[ranked alphabet]]s, an extra function ''Ar'': Σ → ℕ is defined. This function associates a fixed arity to each symbol of the alphabet. In this case, each ''t'' ∈ ''T'' has to satisfy ''Ar''(''V''(''t'')) = ''d''(''t''). The trees that satisfy this property are called '''ranked''' trees. The trees that do not (necessarily) satisfy that property are called '''unranked'''.

For example, the above definition is used in the definition of an [[infinite tree automaton]].

==Example==
Let ''T'' = {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and Σ = {''a'',''b''}. We define a labeling function ''V'' as follows: the labeling for the root node is ''V''(ε) = ''a'' and, for every other node ''t'' ∈ {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, the labellings for its successor nodes are ''V''(''t''.0) = ''a'' and ''V''(''t''.1) = ''b''. It is clear from the picture that ''T'' forms a (fully) infinite binary tree.

==Natural occurrence==
[[File:UraniumUSGOV.jpg|thumb|Uranium ore]]
[[Uranium]] is a naturally occurring element found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. This is the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on earth. According to the [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] the normal concentration of uranium in soil is 300&amp;nbsp;μg/kg to 11.7&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url = http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications/1993.html |author=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation |title=Sources and effects of ionizing radiation : UNSCEAR 1993 Report to the General Assembly, with Scientific Annexes | publisher = [[United Nations]] | isbn = 92-1-142200-0 | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered to be more plentiful than [[antimony]], [[beryllium]], [[cadmium]], [[gold]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[silver]], or [[tungsten]] and is about as abundant as [[tin]], [[arsenic]] or [[molybdenum]]. It is found in many minerals including [[uraninite]] (most common uranium ore), [[autunite]], [[uranophane]], [[torbernite]], and [[coffinite]]. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as [[phosphate]] rock deposits, and minerals such as [[lignite]], and [[monazite]] sands in uranium-rich [[ore]]s (it is recovered commercially from these sources).

[[Seawater]] contains about 3.3 [[parts per billion]] of uranium by weight, approximately (3.3&amp;nbsp;µg/kg) or, 3.3&amp;nbsp;micrograms per [[liter]] of seawater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OeEUcIRsIwAC&amp;pg=PA598&amp;lpg=PA598&amp;dq=Radium+and+thorium+isotopes+in+the+surface+waters+of+the+East+Pacific+and+coastal+southern+California.+Earth+Planet.+Sci.+Lett.,+39:+235249.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0aDXxdrln8&amp;sig=T7Ne1hE0kHZ44OiV-8tr229yQQw&amp;hl=ga&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6KQGVOaqB4ue7Aby8IDACQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%20thorium&amp;f=false |title=Isotopes of the Earth's Hydrosphere  By V.I. Ferronsky, V.A. Polyakov, pg 399}}&lt;/ref&gt; as uranium(VI) forms soluble [[carbonate]] complexes. The extraction of uranium from seawater has been considered as a means of obtaining the element.

==Sources of uranium==

===Mining and milling===
The radiation hazards of uranium mining and milling were not appreciated in the early years, resulting in workers exposed to high levels of radiation. Conventional uranium ore treatment mills create radioactive waste in the form of [[tailings]], which contain uranium, radium, and polonium. Consequently, uranium mining results in "the unavoidable radioactive contamination of the environment by solid, liquid and gaseous wastes".&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Inhalation of [[radon]] gas caused sharp increases in lung cancers among underground uranium miners employed in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name="ama-assn629"&gt;{{Cite journal

In the 1940s and 1950s, uranium mill tailings were released with impunity into water sources, and the radium leached from these tailings contaminated thousands of miles of the Colorado River system. Between 1966 and 1971, thousands of homes and commercial buildings in the Colorado Plateau region were "found to contain anomalously high concentrations of radon, after being built on uranium tailings taken from piles under the authority of the Atomic Energy Commission".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool (2011). ''Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', World Scientific, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metal===
{{See also|Depleted uranium}}
[[File:30mm DU slug.jpg|thumb|right|DU penetrator from the PGU-14/B incendiary 30&amp;nbsp;mm round]]

Depleted uranium (DU) is useful because of its very high [[density]] of 19.1&amp;nbsp;[[Gram|g]]/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (68.4% denser than lead). Civilian uses include counterweights in aircraft, radiation shielding in medical [[radiation therapy]] and industrial [[radiography]] equipment, and containers used to transport radioactive materials. Military uses include defensive armor plating and [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] [[projectiles]].

Uranium metal can disperse into the air and water, [[United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)]] study says in part:
: "The most important concern is the potential for future [[radioactive contamination|groundwater contamination]] by corroding penetrators (ammunition tips made out of DU). The munition tips recovered by the UNEP team had already decreased in mass by 10-15% in this way. This [[Corrosion|rapid corrosion]] speed underlines the importance of monitoring the water quality at the DU sites on an annual basis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=241&amp;ArticleID=3036 |title=UNEP confirms low-level DU contamination |date=March 22, 2002 |publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combustion===
Studies of depleted uranium aerosol exposure suggest that uranium combustion product particles would quickly settle out of the air,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deploymentlink.osd.mil/du_library/du_ii/du_ii_tabl1.htm |title=Depleted uranium |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614010814/http://www.deploymentlink.osd.mil/du_library/du_ii/du_ii_tabl1.htm |archivedate=June 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus could not affect populations more than a few kilometres from target areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004032-200304000-00014 |author=C.

The U.S. has admitted that there have been over 100 "friendly fire" incidents in which members of the U.S. military have been struck by DU munitions, and that an unknown number have been exposed to DU via inhalation of combustion products from burning DU munitions.

===Corrosion===
It has been reported that the corrosion of uranium in a silica rich aqueous solution forms both [[uranium dioxide]] and [[uranium trioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |conference=Goldschmidt Conference |date=7–12 September 2003 |location=[[Kurashiki]], [[Japan]] |url=http://goldschmidt.info/2003/Abstracts.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] abstract |author=E. R. Trueman, S. Black, D. Read &amp; M. E. Hodson |title=Alteration of depleted uranium metal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pure water, [[schoepite]] {(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.12(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)} is formed &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webmineral.com/data/Schoepite.shtml |title=Schoepite Mineral Data |publisher= |accessdate=August 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2010}} in the first week and then after four months [[studtite]] {(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·4(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)} was formed.

Uranium [[metal]] reacts with [[water]] to form [[hydrogen]] gas, this reaction forms [[uranium dioxide]] and 2% to 9% [[uranium hydride]]. It is important to note that the rate of corrosion due to water is far greater than that caused by oxygen at temperatures around {{convert|100|C|F}}. At pH values below 2 the corrosion rate at 100&amp;nbsp;°C goes down greatly, while as pH values go from 7 upwards the corrosion rate declines. Gamma irradiation has little effect on the corrosion rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. McD Baker, L. N. Less &amp; S. Orman |title=Uranium + water reaction. Part 1.—Kinetics, products and mechanism |journal=Transactions of the Faraday Society |volume=62 |pages=2513–2524 |year=1966 |doi=10.1039/TF9666202513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxygen gas inhibits the corrosion of uranium by water.

===Nuclear waste===
Spent [[uranium dioxide]] fuel is very insoluble in water, it is likely to release uranium (and [[fission products]]) even more slowly than borosilicate glass when in contact with water.&lt;ref&gt;B.E. Burakov, M.I Ojovan, W.E. Lee. Crystalline Materials for Actinide Immobilisation, Imperial College Press, London, 198 pp. (2010).
{{cite web |url=http://www.icpress.co.uk/engineering/p652.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309093650/http://www.icpress.co.uk/engineering/p652.html |archivedate=2012-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that while the vast majority of the uranium is removed by [[PUREX]] [[nuclear reprocessing]], a small amount of uranium is left in the [[raffinate]] from the first cycle of the PUREX process. In addition because of the decay of the transplutonium [[minor actinides]] and the residual [[plutonium]] in the waste the concentration of uranium will increase on the waste. This will occur on a time scale of hundreds and thousands of years.

==Health effects==
[[File:Trionuraniumanti.png|thumb|right|Tiron is a [[phenol]]oic [[aromatic]] [[sulfonic acid|disulfonic acid]]. It is an alternative to bicarbonate which has already been tested in animals.]]

Soluble uranium salts are [[toxic]], though less so than those of other heavy metals such as [[lead]] or [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. The organ which is most affected is the [[kidney]]. Soluble uranium salts are readily excreted in the [[urine]], although some accumulation in the kidneys does occur in the case of chronic exposure. The [[World Health Organization]] has established a daily "tolerated intake" of soluble uranium salts for the general public of 0.5&amp;nbsp;μg/kg body weight (or 35&amp;nbsp;μg for a 70&amp;nbsp;kg adult): exposure at this level is not thought to lead to any significant kidney damage.&lt;ref name="IAEA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Features/DU/faq_depleted_uranium.shtml |publisher=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] |title=Focus: Depleted Uranium |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318003818/http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Features/DU/faq_depleted_uranium.shtml |archivedate=March 18, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2010}}

The [[antidote]] for uranium in humans is [[bicarbonate]], which is used because uranium (VI) forms complexes with [[carbonate]]. An alternative is to use tiron (sodium 4,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O. Braun, C. Contino, M.-H. Hengé-Napoli, E. Ansoborlo and B.

===Humans===

====Cancer====
In 1950, the US Public Health service began a comprehensive study of uranium miners, leading to the first publication of a statistical correlation between cancer and uranium mining, released in 1962.&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;Dawson, Susan E, and Gary E Madsen. "Uranium Mine Workers, Atomic Downwinders, and the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act." In Half Lives &amp; Half-Truths: Confronting the Radioactive Legacies of the Cold War, 117-143. Santa Fe: School For Advanced Research, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government eventually regulated the standard amount of [[radon]] in mines, setting the level at 0.3 [[Health effects of radon#Concentration units|WL]] on January 1, 1969.&lt;ref name=Brugge&gt;Brugge, Doug, Timothy Benally, and Esther Yazzie-Lewis. The Navajo People and Uranium Mining. Albuquerque : University of New Mexico Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of 69 69 present and former uranium milling sites in 12 states, 24 have been abandoned, and are the responsibility of the [[US Department of Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atomictraveler.com/MillDecommissioningData.pdf Decommissioning of U.S. Uranium Production Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt;  Accidental releases from uranium mills include the 1979 [[Church Rock uranium mill spill]] in New Mexico, called the largest accident of nuclear-related waste in US history, and the 1986 [[Sequoyah Corporation Fuels Release]] in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=Brugge2&gt;Doug Brugge, et al, "The Sequoyah  Corporation Fuels Release and the Church Rock Spill", ''American Journal of Public Health'', September 2007, Vol., 97, No. 9, pp. 1595-1600.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] (RECA), granting [[reparation (legal)|reparations]] for those affected by mining, with [[amendments]] passed in 2000 to address criticisms with the original act.&lt;ref name = Dawson/&gt;

===Behavior in soil===
It has been suggested that it is possible to form a ''reactive barrier'' by adding something to the soil which will cause the uranium to become fixed. One method of doing this is to use a mineral ([[apatite]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/research/highlights_archive/u_ha_prb.html |author=Christopher C. Fuller, John R. Bargar &amp; James A Davis |title=Remediation of uranium-contaminated waterat Fry Canyon, Utah |date=November 20, 2003 |publisher=[[Stanford University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a second method is to add a food substance such as [[acetate]] to the soil. This will enable bacteria to reduce the uranium (VI) to uranium (IV) which is much less soluble. In [[peat]]-like soils the uranium will tend to bind to the [[humic acids]], this tends to fix the uranium in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/publications/2000annualreview/pdfs/NHMFL2000AR-Geochemistry.pdf |title=Geochemistry |format= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212095102/http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/publications/2000annualreview/pdfs/NHMFL2000AR-Geochemistry.pdf |archivedate=December 12, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wefarm''' is a [[peer-to-peer]] knowledge sharing platform for [[smallholding|smallholder farmers]]. Wefarm users can ask and answer farming questions and share farming tips, via [[SMS]] or online, enabling farmers in rural areas without internet access to share information. Wefarm is built around the principle that rural farming communities in [[developing country|developing countries]] have generations worth of knowledge to share, but lack the tools to do so. Wefarm provides an SMS service based around peer-to-peer, [[crowdsourcing]] of knowledge. Users ask a wide range of questions regarding farming techniques and share information around business ideas, or how to improve livelihoods.

== History and Pilots ==

The idea for Wefarm was born in 2010 out of a perceived need for greater access to information for the 500 million smallholder farmers in developing countries. Only approximately 10% of smallholder farmers have any access to the internet but it is thought that around 90% have access to basic mobile ‘feature’ phones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/02/13/emerging-nations-embrace-internet-mobile-technology/ Emerging Nations Embrace Internet, Mobile Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenny Ewan, CEO of Wefarm, and Claire Rhodes, General Manager of the Cafédirect Producers Foundation (CPF), developed the idea for Wefarm together in 2010 as a project for CPF, a UK-registered charity that works with ~280,000 smallholder tea, coffee and cocoa farmers and their organisations on innovative, community driven projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://producersfoundation.org/about/ Cafédirect Producers Foundation - About Us]&lt;/ref&gt; They developed Wefarm together as a peer-to-peer knowledge sharing platform, giving smallholder farmers a way to access information from other farmers around the world through basic mobile phones and SMS.

Wefarm was piloted, tested and developed over 2011 and 2012 as a CPF project with funding from the Nominet Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/what-we-support/projects/wefarm-supporting-smallholders-overseas/ Wefarm - Supporting smallholders overseas]&lt;/ref&gt; This initial prototype of the system was tested in partnership with smallholder farming organisations in [[Peru]], [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]] with successful proof of concept achieved - a real-time, multilingual knowledge sharing by farmers in 3 countries with no access to internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/sites/default/files/Nom_CaseStudy_cafe.pdf/ A Nominet Trust Case Study - Wefarm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Wefarm was won the Knight News Challenge, run by the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation|Knight Foundation]], providing support to build a more robust, scalable version of the proof of concept system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://knightfoundation.org/grants/20123669/ Knight Foundation Grants]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Wefarm was an overall winner of the Google Impact Challenge, providing funding to launch Wefarm in several different countries around the world and take it to scale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/uk2014/charity/we-farm Google Impact Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018 Wefarm announced it has reached over 1.1 million users across Kenya and Uganda, with plans to expand into the rest of Africa in 2019, beginning with Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-largest-farmer-farmer-network-144800836.html World’s Largest Farmer-to-Farmer Network, Wefarm, Reaches over One Million Users]&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Launch ===

Wefarm launched its newly built v1.0 in Kenya in February 2015, and subsequently in Peru in August 2015.

As of late September 2015 Wefarm had a total number of 18,260 users, with over 1 million SMS messages sent through their platform to date, and more than 45,000 answers to farmers questions shared. Around 60% of farmers who sign-up to Wefarm subsequently actively contribute knowledge to the system.

== Social Goals ==

=== Social goals - users ===

Wefarm users can access vital information that will improve their livelihoods through increasing crop yield, diversifying farming practices, creating micro businesses, and increasing household incomes.

By sharing information users will also build up a bank of agricultural knowledge that can benefit isolated farmers around the developing world.

=== Social goals - commercial partners ===

Food and drink companies, supermarkets, and other businesses with suppliers in Africa and Latin America can improve supply chain transparency and increase supply chain sustainability through partnering with Wefarm.

== Technology ==

Wefarm is an SMS-based peer-to-peer knowledge sharing platform that can be accessed using a basic mobile phone. Users sign up for free sending an SMS to a national short-code number in each country of operation. The user then registers their name, and can ask a question by sending an SMS to the Wefarm number.

Questions are crowdsourced via other farmers in the region and around the world, using a voluntary translation tool.

== Business model ==

In January 2015 Wefarm was launched as a social enterprise subsidiary of CPF, with a for-profit business model in order to achieve long-term financial sustainability and scalability. Wefarm plans to partner with local, national, and international companies who want to increase sustainability and transparency in their supply chains and access isolated farming markets.

'''The William Blake Archive''' is a [[digital humanities]] project first created in 1996. The project is sponsored by the [[Library of Congress]] and supported by the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].&lt;ref name = SiteInfo&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/site.info.html| publisher = The William Blake Archive| title = The William Blake Archive Site Info| accessdate = March 19, 2013|date = June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the [[Rossetti Archive]], the archive provides digital reproductions of the various works of [[William Blake]], a prominent [[Romanticism|Romantic]]-period poet, artist, and engraver, alongside annotation, commentary and scholarly materials related to Blake.&lt;ref name = Eaves&gt;{{cite journal| title = Behind the Scenes at the William Blake Archive: Collaboration Takes More Than E-mail | last = Eaves| first = Morris| volume = 3| issue = 2 | date = December 1997| journal = Journal of Electronic Publishing| doi = 10.3998/3336451.0003.202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When publishing his poetry, William Blake would create print block illustrations for his book, print his books in black and white and then hand paint the illustrations within the prints. Furthermore, many of his works underwent multiple editions of printing, each with unique variations in the prints used to illustrate the poems and the poems themselves. Because of this complex process and the quality of his art, his art and poetry has been highly sought by collectors and scholars. The archive, as a [[digital humanities]] project, provides high quality digital copies of the facsimiles, providing scholars and students an opportunity to see the complexity of his published works often not available by viewing the scholarly print editions.&lt;ref name = McQuail&gt;{{Cite web| title = Using the William Blake Archive in Teaching Poetry| first =Josephine A. | last = McQuail| work = "World Wide Poetry on the Web" a MLA Poetry Division Panel| url = http://epc.buffalo.edu/conferences/00/mla/web.html| publisher = The Electronic Poetry Center at The University of Buffalo| accessdate = March 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Viscomi&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Computers and the Humanities| date = February 2002| volume = 36| issue =  1| pages =27–48| title = Digital Facsimiles: Reading the William Blake Archive| first =Joseph | last =Viscomi| doi = 10.1023/A:1013163229994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archive has been peer reviewed by the [[Modern Language Association]] in 2005 and the [[Multimedia Educational Tools for Learning and Online Teaching]] (MERLOT) process in 2010.&lt;ref name = SiteInfo/&gt;&lt;ref name = MERLOT&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.merlot.org/merlot/viewCompositeReview.htm?id=502599|title = Peer Review:The William Blake Archive| date = Nov 25, 2010| author = English Editorial Board|accessdate = March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MERLOT highly recommended the use of the tool for teaching, praising the access to primary sources it provides; however, they also noted the need for educators to create instructional materials on how to use the site and the ease by which someone could get lost.&lt;ref name = MERLOT/&gt; Scholars have also written a number of educational case studies on how to use the archive.&lt;ref group =note&gt;See for example Josephine A.
