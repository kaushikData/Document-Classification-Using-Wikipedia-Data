{{refimprove|date=November 2013}}

'''Ashwin''' or '''Ashvin''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|'|ʃ|w|ɪ|n}}; {{lang-ne|आश्विन , असोज}}, {{lang-bn|আশ্বিন}}; {{lang-hi|अश्विन}}; [[Malay language|Malay]]/[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Aswin''; [[Thai language|Thai]]: ''Asawin''), also known as '''Aswayuja''', is the seventh month of the lunisolar [[Hindu calendar]], the  [[Vikram Samvat]], which is the official solar calendar of [[Nepal]] and the parts of India. It is the sixth month in the [[Bengali calendars|solar Bengali calendar]] and seventh in the lunar [[Indian national calendar]] of the [[Deccan Plateau]]. It falls in the season of ''Shôrot'', (Hindi ''Sharad'') or Autumn. In Vedic Jyotish, Ashwin begins with the [[Sun]]'s enter in [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]].

It overlaps September and October&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Helene. (Ed.) (2005) ''Holidays, festivals, and celebrations of the world dictionary'' Third edition. Electronic edition. Detroit: Omnigraphics, p. xxix. {{ISBN|0-7808-0982-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Gregorian calendar]] and is the month preceding [[Diwali]] or [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] the festival of lights. In lunar religious calendars, Ashwin begins on the new moon after the autumn equinox.

==Etymology==
[[Ashvini]] is the first star that appears in the evening sky. In Indian astrology it is the head of [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]], or the first of the 27 [[Nakshatra]]. Ashvin also stands for the [[divine twins]], the [[Ashvins]], the gods of vision, Ayurvedic medicine, the glow of sunrise and sunset, and averting misfortune and sickness in [[Hindu mythology]]. ''Asawin'' is the [[Thai language|Thai]] variant of Ashvin and stands for warrior. The term is often translated into English as "knight".

==Festivals==
Several major religious holidays take place in Ashvin. Those are as follows:
# [[Navaratri]] (1-9 Ashvin)
# [[Durga Puja]] (6-10 Ashvin)
# [[Kojagiri]] Pornima (15 Ashvin)
# [[Vijayadashami]] or [[Dussehra]] (10 Ashvin) 
# [[Diwali|Divali]] festival including [[Dhanteras]] (28 Ashvin), [[Naraka Chaturdasi]] (29 Ashvin) and [[Lakshmi Puja]] (Last day of Ashvin)
# [[Kali Puja]] (new moon of Ashvin), which are held as per the [[lunar calendar]], usually fall in this month.

==Regional variation==
Ashwin is known as ''aipasi'' (ஐப்பசி ) in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and begins when the sun enters Libra in October.

It's also called 'kunwaar' ( कुॅंवार ) month in eastern U.P. &amp; some parts of Bihar state.

'''Bagh''' ({{lang-hi|बाग}}) is a [[census town]] in [[Dhar district]]  in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]]. It is known for the [[Bagh Caves]], which are late 4th- to 6th-century Buddhist rock-cut chambers with murals. The name of the town stems from the caves - according to local legend there were living tigers (''bagh'' in several languages of India) in these abandoned Buddhist caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/As/India/MadhyaPradesh/Bagh.htm | title = Bagh Caves - rock cut Buddhist temples | accessdate = 2010-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town is also known for a type of block prints on fabric, known as [[Bagh print]]s.

== History ==

In 1982, a hoard of 27 inscriptions issued by the [[Maharajas of Valkha]] was discovered at Risawala near Bagh. The inscriptions were issued from a place known as Valkha, which has led to suggestions that the name "Bagh" is derived from "Valkha". The inscriptions are dated to the years 38-134 of an unspecified [[calendar era]]. Historians [[D. C. Sircar]] and [[R. C. Majumdar]] theorized that the Maharajas of Valkha were subordinates to the Guptas, and the calendar era used in their inscription is the Gupta era starting from 319 CE.{{sfn|Shiv Kumar Tiwari|2002|pp=63-64}} Thus, the Maharajas of Valkha can be dated to 4th and 5th centuries CE.{{sfn|Archana Verma|2007|p=23}}

The next known ruler of the region is Maharaja Subandhu of [[Mahishmati]]. His [[Bagh Caves]] inscription is dated 167 (486 CE, assuming Gupta era).{{sfn|Archana Verma|2007|p=23}}{{sfn|Walter M. Spink|2005|p=37}} Historian Walter M. Spink has identified Subandhu as the prince Vishruta mentioned in ''[[Dashakumaracharita]]''. According to his theory, Subandhu or Vishruta was a Gupta prince, who established the dynasty that later came to be known as [[Kalachuri]].{{sfn|Walter M. Spink|2005|pp=153-154}}{{sfn|Sara L. Schastok|1985|p=97}}

'''போகர்''' or '''Bogar''' or ''Bhogar'' or '''Boganathar''' or '''Boyang''' has been authoritatively described in various traditions and texts as a [[Tamils|Tamil]] [[siddhar]] who lived sometime between 550 and 300 BC. He has mentioned about his native roots in his book "Bogar 7000"Bogar went from Tamil Nadu to China and taught about enlightenment, this is also mentioned in his book Bogar 7000. Bogar is said to be in "Nirvigalpa Samadhi" below the sanctum sanatorium of [[Palani]] Murugan hill temple,a state where the yogi is mediating immersed inside water{{citation needed|reason=Insufficient proof|date=March 2016}}

According to legends and the temple scriptures of Palani temple,it is known that Bogar created the idol of [[Murugan]] at the hill temple in [[Palani]] by mixing nine poisonous herbs ([[Navapashanam]]) using an unique procedure. He also established the [[Kuzhanthai Velappar temple|temple for Murugan]] in [[Poombarai]] [[ Kuzhanthai Velappar temple ]] [[Kodaikanal]] [[Tamilnadu]], India. There is an extant statue of lord Murugan by Navaphasanam .The milk that was poured on this statue has been said to have mixed with some of the herbs thereby proving to be an effective cure for the diseases during the time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= White|first= David Gordon|title= The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226149349|url=|pages=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; The priests of [[Palani Murugan temple]] were said to have been the descendants of Pulipani, one of Bogar's students, until the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Clothey|first=Fred W.|title=The many faces of Murugan̲: the history and meaning of a South Indian god|year=1978|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-90-279-7632-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0AevljBmCRQC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq=Bhogar&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=reOZTOWXA-GV4gawlNGLAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhogar&amp;f=false|author2=A.K.

'''Brian W. Harrison''' OS&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2006/0612fea4.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414030748/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2006/0612fea4.asp |date=April 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 1945 in [[Sydney, Australia]]) is an Australian-born Roman Catholic priest and theologian. Harrison is a prolific writer on religious issues and an emeritus professor of theology at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico]] (1989–2007).  He speaks Spanish fluently.  Harrison is also an associate editor of "Living Tradition", a publication of the Roman Theological Forum hosted by the Oblates of Wisdom in St Louis, Missouri, United States, where Harrison currently lives at the order's study center. The forum's website contains many articles by Harrison, including one of the very few serious theological analyses carried out so far regarding biblical and Catholic teaching on torture and corporal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtforum.org |title=Welcome to the Roman Theological Forum |publisher=Rtforum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and views ==

Harrison was baptised in a [[Methodism|Methodist church]] and brought up in [[Presbyterianism]]. He spent a few years with a Lutheran mission in New Guinea, where he became a Roman Catholic in 1972.

Harrison is doctrinally conservative. While opposing some interpretations of the Second Vatican Council allegedly made by progressive and Modernists, he also opposes what he considers excessive criticism of the actual texts of that council by some traditionalist Catholics. His main published work is ''Religious Liberty and Contraception'' (Melbourne: John XXIII Fellowship, 1988), in which he argues for the doctrinal continuity (non-contradiction) between Vatican II's Declaration on Religious Liberty (''Dignitatis Humanae'') and the earlier papal encyclicals on church, state and religious tolerance. He concludes that the kind of doctrinal development represented by ''Dignitatis Humanae'' does not, as some{{Who|date=September 2010}} have claimed, set a magisterial precedent for more radical changes such as a hypothetical future papal reversal or mitigation of Catholic teaching against contraception.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Harrison is also one of the few [[young earth creationists]] among Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtforum.org/lt/lt93.html Early Vatican Responses to Evolutionist Theology], ''Living Tradition'', Organ of the Roman Theological Forum, May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtforum.org/lt/lt97.html Did woman evolve from the beasts? A defence of traditional Catholic doctrine—Part I], ''Living Tradition'', Organ of the Roman Theological Forum, January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtforum.org/lt/lt97.html Did woman evolve from the beasts? A defence of traditional Catholic doctrine—Part II], ''Living Tradition'', Organ of the Roman Theological Forum, March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he does not share the absolute [[geocentrism]] of other Catholic creationists such as [[Robert Sungenis]].

Harrison is also an opponent of [[Sedevacantism]] and, in 2000, authored a tract entitled ''A Heretical Pope would Govern Validly but Illicitly''. In this tract he based his argument on the 1945 legislation of Pope Pius XII concerning a papal election, ''Vacantis Apostolicæ Sedis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholiccouncil.homestead.com/VacantisSedisApostolicae.html |title=Website Disabled |publisher=Catholiccouncil.homestead.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The papal legislation declared, in part:

:"None of the Cardinals may in any way, or by pretext or reason of any excommunication, suspension, or interdict whatsoever, or of any other ecclesiastical impediment, be excluded from the active and passive election of the Supreme Pontiff. We hereby suspend such censures solely for the purposes of the said election; at other times they are to remain in vigor."{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Criticism==

Sedevacantists have made rebuttals, claiming to refute the article ''A Heretical Pope would Govern Validly but Illicitly''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/articles/article.php?id=15&amp;catname=10 |title=Sedevacantism Refuted? &amp;#124; Articles: Sedevacantism Pope Issue &amp;#124; Traditional Latin Mass Resources |publisher=Traditionalmass.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/blog/2007/06/25/can-an-excommunicated-cardinal-be-elected-pope/ |title=: Quidlibet : " Can an Excommunicated Cardinal be Elected Pope? |publisher=Traditionalmass.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Ibranyi (a sedevacantist author and speaker) wrote against Harrison.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.johnthebaptist.us/jbw_english/documents/refutations/rjmi/rr19_ag_fr_harrison.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43444">[[File:Subgenius-JHVH-1-by-St-Ken.jpg|thumb|[[Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1]], the primary deity of the Church of the SubGenius.]]
The '''Church of the SubGenius''' is a [[parody religion]] that satirizes better-known belief systems. It teaches a complex philosophy that focuses on [[J. R. "Bob" Dobbs]], purportedly a salesman from the 1950s, who is revered as a prophet by the Church. SubGenius leaders have developed detailed narratives about Dobbs and his relationship to various gods and conspiracies. Their central deity, [[Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1]], is accompanied by other gods drawn from ancient myth and popular fiction. SubGenius literature describes a grand conspiracy that seeks to brainwash the world and oppress Dobbs' followers. In its narratives, the Church presents a blend of cultural references in an elaborate remix of the sources.

[[Ivan Stang]], who co-founded the Church of the SubGenius in the 1970s, serves as its leader and publicist. He has imitated actions of other religious leaders, using the tactic of [[culture jamming]] in an attempt to undermine better-known faiths. Church leaders instruct their followers to avoid mainstream commercialism and the belief in [[absolute truth]]s. The group holds that the quality of "Slack" is of utmost importance—it is never clearly defined. The number of followers is unknown, although the Church's message has been welcomed by college students and artists in the United States. The group is often compared to [[Discordianism]]. Journalists often consider the Church to be an elaborate joke, but a few academics have defended it as an honest system of deeply held beliefs.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}}{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=43}}

==Origins==
The Church of the SubGenius was founded by [[Ivan Stang]] (born Douglas St Clair Smith) and Philo Drummond (born Steve Wilcox){{sfn|Chryssides|2012|p=95}} as the SubGenius Foundation.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} Dr. X (born Monte Dhooge) was also present at the group's inception.{{sfn|Shea|2006}} The organization's first recorded activity was the publication of a photocopied document, known as the ''Sub Genius Pamphlet #1'', disseminated in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] in 1979. The document announced the impending end of the world and the possible deaths of its readers.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} It criticized Christian conceptions of God and [[New Age]] perceptions of spirituality.{{sfn|Niesel|2000}}

Church leaders maintain that a man named [[J. R. "Bob" Dobbs]] founded the group in 1953.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} SubGenius members constructed an elaborate account of the life of Dobbs, which is described by commentators as fictional.{{sfn|Kinsella|2011|p=67}} They assert that he telepathically contacted Drummond in 1972, before meeting him in person the next year, and that Drummond persuaded Ivan Stang to join shortly afterwards.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} Stang describes himself as the "sacred scribe" of Dobbs and a "professional maven of weirdness".{{sfn|Batz|1995}}{{sfn|Giffels|1995}}

==Beliefs==

===Deities===
The Church of the SubGenius's ostensible beliefs defy categorization or a simple narrative, often striking outside observers as bizarre and convoluted.{{sfn|Batz|1995}} The group has developed an intricate mythology involving gods, aliens, and mutants, which is usually considered by observers to satirize other religions.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} Their primary deity, generally known as Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} is cast as an extraterrestrial, who contacted Dobbs in the 1950s. Various accounts state that the encounter occurred while Dobbs was building a television or watching late-night television.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=85}}{{sfn|Rea|1985}} Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 gave him supernatural knowledge of the past and future, in addition to incredible power.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=85}} Dobbs then posed deep questions to the alien, receiving mysterious answers.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=102}} Some of their discussion centered on a powerful conspiracy, to which the Church attributes command of the world.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}}

Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 and his spouse [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], regarded by the Church as "relatively evil", are classified as "rebel gods".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|pp=86 &amp; 101}} SubGenius leaders note that Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 is wrathful, a quality expressed by his "stark fist of removal".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} The Church teaches that they are part of the Elder Gods, who are committed to human pain, but that Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 is "relatively good" in comparison. [[Yog-Sothoth]], a character from [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]], is the leader of the Elder Gods. In her 2010 study of the Church of the SubGenius, religious scholar Carole Cusack of the [[University of Sydney]] states that Lovecraft's work is a "model for the Church of the SubGenius' approach to scripture", in that aspects of his fiction were treated as real by some within paganism, just as the Church appropriates aspects of popular culture in its spirituality.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=101}}

===J. R. "Bob" Dobbs===
{{Main article|J. R. "Bob" Dobbs}}
[[File:June and Ward Cleaver Leave it to Beaver 1958.JPG|thumb|[[Ward Cleaver]] (right), to whom Dobbs' appearance is often compared.]]

SubGenius leaders teach that Dobbs' nature is ineffable and consequently stylize his name with quotation marks.{{sfn|Hart|1992}}{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} They cast him as a "World Avatar"{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} and hold that he has died and been reborn many times.{{sfn|Batz|1995}} The Church's primary symbol is an icon of his face in which he smokes a pipe.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} Stang states that the image was taken from [[Yellow Pages]] clip art,{{sfn|Hart|1992}} and it has been likened to [[Ward Cleaver]],{{sfn|Batz|1995}} [[Mark Trail]],{{sfn|Rea|1985}} or a 1950s-era salesman.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} The Church's canon contains references to aspects of the culture of the United States in that decade;{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}} religious scholar Danielle Kirby of [[RMIT University]] argues that this type of reference "simultaneously critiques and subverts" the concept of the [[American dream]].{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}}

In the Church's mythology, Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 had intended for Dobbs to lead a powerful conspiracy and brainwash individuals to make them work for a living. Dobbs refused to support the group; instead, he infiltrated it and organized a counter-movement. Church leaders teach that he was a very intelligent child and, as he grew older, studied several religious traditions, including [[Sufism]], [[Rosicrucianism]], and the [[Fourth Way]].{{sfn|Cusack|2010|pp=84–6}} Another key event in his life occurred when he traveled to [[Tibet]]; there he learned vital truths about topics including [[Yeti]]s. The Church teaches that Yetis exist, and that SubGenius members have descended from them. The only relative of Dobbs that the Church identifies is his mother, Jane McBride Dobbs—Church leaders cite his lack of resemblance to his mother's husband as the reason for not revealing his father.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|pp=84–6}} Dobbs is married to a woman named [[J. R. "Bob" Dobbs#Connie Dobbs|Connie]]; SubGenius leaders identify the couple as archetypes of the genders in a belief that resembles Hindu doctrines about [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]].{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=85}} Church literature has variously described Dobbs' occupation as "drilling equipment" or [[fluoride]] sales,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}}{{sfn|Rea|1985}} and accounts of his life generally emphasize his good fortune rather than intelligence.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}} SubGenius leaders believe that he is capable of time travel, and that this ability results in occasional changes to doctrine, deemed the "Sacred Doctrine of Erasability" by the Church. Consequently, members attempt to follow Dobbs by eschewing unchangeable plans.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}}

==={{anchor|slack}}Conspiracy and "Slack"===
The Church of the SubGenius's literature incorporates many aspects of conspiracy theories,{{sfn|Davidoff|2003|p=170}} teaching that there is a grand conspiracy at the root of all lesser ones.{{sfn|Hart|1992}} It records that there are many UFOs, most of which are used by the conspiracy leaders to monitor humans, although a few contain extraterrestrials. In the Church's view, this conspiracy uses a façade of empowering messages but manipulates people so that they become indoctrinated into its service.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} The Church refers to these individuals as "pinks" and states that they are blissfully unaware of the organization's power and control.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=93}} SubGenius leaders teach that most cultural and religious mores are the conspiracy's propaganda.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}} They maintain that their followers, but not the pinks, are capable of developing an imagination; the Church teaches that Dobbs has empowered its members to see through these illusions. Owing to their descent from Yetis, the Church's followers have a capacity for deep understanding that the pinks lack.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} [[Cultural studies]] scholar Solomon Davidoff states that the Church develops a "satiric commentary" on religion, morality, and conspiracies.{{sfn|Davidoff|2003|p=170}}

SubGenius members believe that those in the service of the conspiracy seek to bar them from "Slack",{{sfn|Davidoff|2003|p=170}} a quality promoted by the Church. Its teachings center on "Slack"{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} (always capitalized),{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} which is never concisely defined, except in the claim that Dobbs embodies the quality.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}}{{sfn|Duncombe|2005|p=222}} Church members seek to acquire "Slack" and believe that it will allow them the free, comfortable life (without hard work or responsibility) which they claim as an entitlement.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=85}}{{sfn|Duncombe|2005|p=226}} Sex and the avoidance of work are taught as two key ways to gain "Slack".{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} Davidoff believes that "Slack" is "the ability to effortlessly achieve your goals".{{sfn|Davidoff|2003|p=170}} Cusack states that the Church's description of "Slack" as ineffable recalls the way that [[Tao]] is described,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} and Kirby casts "Slack" as a "unique magical system".{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}}  The [[Slackware]] Linux distribution is so named after the tenet of Slack.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The Church of the SubGenius's founders were based in Dallas when they distributed their first document. The SubGenius Foundation moved to [[Cleveland]], Ohio, in 1999.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} In 2009, Stang claimed that the Church had 40,000&amp;nbsp;members, but the actual number may have been much lower.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=106}} As of 2012, becoming a minister in the Church consists of paying a $35&amp;nbsp;fee;{{sfn|SubGenius.com Sales}} Stang has estimated that there are 10,000&amp;nbsp;ministers{{sfn|Rea|1985}}{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}}{{sfn|Scoblionkov|1998}} and that the Church's annual income has reached $100,000.{{sfn|Niesel|2000}} In October 2017, The Church moved to [[Glen Rose, Texas|Glen Rose]], Texas.

Most SubGenius members are male,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=102}} and, according to Stang, many of them are social outcasts.{{sfn|Giffels|1995}} He maintains that those who do not fit into society will ultimately triumph over those who do.{{sfn|Niesel|2000}} The Church has experienced success "converting" college students,{{sfn|Batz|1995}} particularly at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].{{sfn|Yuen|1998}} It has also gained popularity in several American cities, including [[San Francisco]], [[Little Rock]], and Cleveland.{{sfn|Giffels|1995}}{{sfn|Ashbrook|1988}} A few Church members have voiced concerns and/or amusement about new members who took the Church too seriously, fearing that they acted like serious cult-followers, the very concept that the SubGenius parodies.{{sfn|Rea|1985}} Stang has expressed concern that the Church's doctrines could exacerbate pre-existing [[psychosis|psychoses]] of mentally ill devotees, although he believes that the Church genuinely helps many adherents.{{sfn|Giffels|1995}}

Notable associates of the Church include [[Mark Mothersbaugh]],{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} [[Mojo Nixon]],{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} [[Paul Mavrides]],{{sfn|Giffels|1995}} [[Paul Reubens]],{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=94}} members of [[Negativland]],{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} [[David Byrne]], and [[Robert Crumb|R.&amp;nbsp;Crumb]].{{sfn|Callahan|1996}} Crumb, a cartoonist, provided early publicity for the church by reprinting ''Sub Genius Pamphlet #1'' in his comics anthology ''[[Weirdo (magazine)|Weirdo]]''.{{sfn|Niesel|2000}} References to the Church are present in several works of art,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=111}} including the Internet-based [[collaborative fiction]] ''[[Ong's Hat]]'', the comic book ''[[The Middleman]]'', the band [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]]'s album ''[[40oz. to Freedom]]'', and the television program ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]''.{{sfn|Kinsella|2011|p=64–7}}{{sfn|Lloyd|2008}}{{sfn|Knight|2012|p=96}}

===Instructions===
Church leaders have issued specific instructions to their followers;{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}} Robert Latham of the [[University of California, Riverside]], casts their ideology as "anarcholibertarian".{{sfn|Latham|2002|p=94}} Five specific commands particularly embody the group's values.

*The first command is to shun regular employment and stop working. This encapsulates the Church's view that to repent is to "SLACK OFF" (''[[sic]]''),{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}} in opposition to the idea of working for a living.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}} SubGenius leaders state that it is permissible for members to collect public assistance in lieu of maintaining employment.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}}
*The second command is to purchase products that are sold by the Church, which its leaders teach was founded by Dobbs to gain wealth.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=87}} Unlike most religious groups, the Church proudly admits it is for-profit (presumably mocking some religious groups that seem to have ulterior financial motives).{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} Cusack sees the instruction to buy as an ironic parody of the "[[Wall Street (1987 film)|greed is good]]" mentality of the 1980s,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}} and Kirby notes that although the group emphasizes "the consumption of popular cultural artefacts", this consumption is "simultaneously de-emphasized by the processes of remix".{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=52}}
*The third command is to rebel against "law and order": specifically, the Church condemns security cameras and encourages computer hacking. Cusack notes that this instruction recalls [[Robert Anton Wilson]]'s critique of law and order.
*The fourth command is to rid the world of everyone who did not descend from [[Yeti]]s.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}} SubGenius leaders teach that Dobbs hopes to rid the Earth of 90&amp;nbsp;percent of humanity, making the Earth "clear".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=87}} The group praises drug abuse and abortion as effective methods of culling unneeded individuals.
*The fifth command is to exploit fear, specifically that of individuals who are part of the conspiracy. Church leaders teach that members of the conspiracy fear SubGenius devotees.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}}

===Devivals===

Local groups of members of the Church of the SubGenius are known as "clenches". They host periodic events known as "devivals", which include sermons, music, and other art forms.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} Devival is a term used by both the [[Church of the Subgenius]] and later [[Discordianism]]{{cn|date=June 2018}} for a gathering or festival of followers. The name is a pun on [[Christian]] [[Revival meeting|revivals]].&lt;ref name=Cusack&gt;{{citation

At devivals, leaders take comical names and give angry rants,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=93}} and many devivals occur in bars or similar venues.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=106}} Cusack compares the style of the services to [[Pentecostal]] [[revivalism]];{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=93}} David Giffels of the ''[[Akron Beacon Journal]]'' casts them as "campy preaching sessions".{{sfn|Giffels|1995}} Cusack posits that these events are examples of [[Peter Lamborn Wilson]]'s concept of [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s, spaces in which the ordinary constraints of social control are suspended.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=97}} On one occasion, the presence of the wife of a Church leader at a SubGenius meeting that included public nudity and a goat costume contributed to her losing custody of her children in a court case. However, the publicity surrounding the event was ultimately a boon to the Church's recruitment efforts.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=107}}

The Church also celebrates several holidays in honor of characters drawn from fiction and popular culture, such as [[Monty Python]], [[Dracula]], and [[Klaatu (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Klaatu]].{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=104}} The [[Association for Consciousness Exploration]] and pagan groups have occasionally assisted the Church in its events.{{sfn|Leiby|1994}}{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=106}} Some SubGenius members put little emphasis on meetings, citing the Church's focus on individualism, although the ''Book of the SubGenius'' discusses community.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|pp=98–9}}

SubGenius devivals are not regularly scheduled, but are recorded on the SubGenius website.&lt;ref name=DevivalHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subgenius.com/bigfist/fun/devivals/devivals.html|title=Reports on Great Devivals of yore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devivals have been held in multiple states within the continental United States, as well as different countries, including China, the Netherlands, and Germany. The Church has also held Devivals at non-SubGenius events, such as [[Burning Man]] and the [[Starwood Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SubSite - Past Events|url = http://www.subgenius.com/bigfist/fun/devivals/devivals.html|website = www.subgenius.com|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ivanstang.jpg|right|thumb|Rev. [[Ivan Stang]] of the Church of the SubGenius at ''The Cyclone of Slack'']]
''The Cyclone of Slack''&lt;ref name=PDXPoster&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/36254855@N00/4036592396/|title=Salvation - $10|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PDXDevival&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdxdevival.com/|title=Cyclone of Slack|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Devival in Portland, Oregon, in October 2009 put on by the joint efforts of the [[Church of the Subgenius]]&lt;ref name=HourOfSlack1232&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subgenius.com/ts/hos_logs/Hour_of_Slack_1232.html|title=Hour of Slack #1232 - Portland Cyclone of Slack Devival 1 - 59:08|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the organizers of Esozone.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

One of the more bizarre moments of the evening was when suddenly, in 2s and 3s, the alcohol and [[fire-and-brimstone]] sermon fueled crowd in front of the stage began to sit down and Slack when the Duke of Uke began to play his [[ukulele]].&lt;ref name=DukeofUke&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPYhpNMM16I|title=Duke of Uke calms the Devival with the healing power of the ukulele|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Go Fuck Yourself" devival was held in [[Astoria, New York]], in October 2010 put on by the Church of the Subgenius at the Wonderland Collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/subgenius-devival-/E0-001-034012941-7|title=SUBGENIUS DEVIVAL IN ASTORIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Day===
In early SubGenius literature, July 5, 1998, was introduced as a significant date, later becoming known as "[[X-Day (Church of the SubGenius)|X-Day]]".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}} The Church held that Dobbs identified the date's significance in the 1950s,{{sfn|Scoblionkov|1998}} claiming that the world was to experience a massive change on that date when Xists, beings from Planet&amp;nbsp;X, would arrive on Earth.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}} SubGenius leaders declared that their paying members were to be transported onto spaceships for union with goddesses as the world was destroyed,{{sfn|Gunn|Beard|2000|p=269}} although a few posited that they would be sent to a joyful hell.{{sfn|Giffels|1995}} In anticipation of the event, X-Day "drills" were held in 1996 and 1997.{{sfn|SubGenius.com Devivals}}

In July 1998, the Church held a large devival at a "clothing-optional" campground in [[Sherman, New York]],{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}}{{sfn|Yuen|1998}} attended by about 400&amp;nbsp;members.{{sfn|Scoblionkov|1998}} The event was ostensibly intended to celebrate the coming of aliens. When their appearance was not detected using the technology available at that time, Stang speculated that they might arrive in 8661, an inversion of 1998;{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}} this has been interpreted as a satire of the way that religious groups have revised prophecies after their failures.{{sfn|Gunn|Beard|2000|p=269}} Some critics have dismissed the event as a prank or form of "performance art".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}} Steve Bevilacqua, the Church's business manager, admitted that his group made strange predictions about aliens, but contended that their statements were as believable as the account of [[Jesus' walk on water]].{{sfn|Yuen|1998}} Another theory is that The Conspiracy has lied about what year the present year actually is (just as they have lied about everything else), so that the liberation date would seem to pass without fulfillment and cause followers to lose faith. As a precaution, SubGenius members continue to gather for X-Day every July 5 after 1998. At these events, the non-appearance of the aliens is celebrated.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}}{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=98}} Cusack casts the productions as [[carnivalesque]]{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=98}} or an echo of ancient Greek [[satyr play]]s.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}}

==Publishing==

=== Online ===
The Church of the SubGenius established a website in May 1993,{{sfn|Ciolek|2003|p=800}} and its members were very active on [[Usenet]] in the 1990s.{{sfn|Batz|1995}}

=== Print ===
Although it has gained a significant online presence, it was successful before the advent of Internet communities.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=44}} The Church was a pioneer in the religious use of [[zine]]s;{{sfn|Kinsella|2011|p=64}} Cusack notes that its use of the medium can be seen as a rejection of the alienation of labor practices.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=100}}

The SubGenius Foundation has published several official teachings, as well as non-doctrinal works by Stang.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} The ''Book of the SubGenius'', which discusses "Slack" at length, was published by [[Simon&amp;nbsp;&amp; Schuster]] and sold 30,000&amp;nbsp;copies in its first five years in print.{{sfn|Ashbrook|1988}}{{sfn|Stein|1993|p=179}} Kirby casts the book as a "call to arms for the forces of absurdity".{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}} The juxtaposition, visual style, and content of the book mirror the group as a whole.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=51}} It draws themes from fiction, as well as established and new religions, parodying a number of topics, including the Church of the SubGenius itself.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}}

A number of SubGenius writers have authored stories to build their mythology, which have been compiled and published.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=100}} Their core texts are disordered, presented in the style of a collage.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=48}} Kirby notes that the group's texts are a [[bricolage]] of cultural artifacts, which is then remixed into a new creation.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}}{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=51}} In this process, Kirby argues, they interweave and juxtapose a variety of concepts, which she describes as a "web of references".{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}}

=== Video ===
The group has also been promoted by a video Stang produced in 1992.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}}{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}}

=== Radio ===
The Church of the SubGenius hosts several radio shows throughout the world, including broadcasters in Atlanta, Ohio, Maryland, and California. ''[[Hour of Slack|The Hour of Slack]]'', the Church’s most popular audio production, is broadcast by several radio stations in the United States and two in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SubSite - Radio|url = http://www.subgenius.com/ts/hos.html|website = www.subgenius.com|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis and commentary==

===Comparative religion===
The Church's teachings are often perceived as satirizing Christianity and Scientology,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} earning them a reputation as a [[parody religion]].{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} Church leaders have stated that Dobbs met [[L.&amp;nbsp;Ron Hubbard]], and SubGenius narratives echo [[Space opera in Scientology|extraterrestrial themes found in Scientology]].{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=105}} Cusack notes that descriptions of Jehovah 1 bear noticeable similarities to [[Xenu]], a powerful alien found in some Scientologist writings.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=87}} The Church's rhetoric has also been seen as a satirical imitation of the [[televangelism]] of the 1980s.{{sfn|Callahan|1996}} Cusack sees the Church's faux commercialism as [[culture jamming]] targeting [[prosperity theology]];{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=104}} she describes this as "a strikingly original innovation in contemporary religion".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=111}} Religious scholar Thomas Alberts of the [[University of London]] views the Church as attempting to "subvert the idea of authenticity in religion" by mirroring other religions to create both a sense of similarity and [[alterity]].{{sfn|Alberts|2008|p=127}}

Cusack compares the Church of the SubGenius to the [[Ranter]]s, a radical 17th-century pantheist movement in England. She notes that they made statements that shocked many hearers, attacking traditional notions of religious orthodoxy and political authority. In her view, this demonstrates that the Church of the SubGenius has "legitimate pedigree in the history of Western religion".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|pp=106–7}} The American journalist [[Michael Muhammad Knight]] likens the Church to the [[Moorish Orthodox Church of America]], a 20th-century American [[syncretism|syncretic]] religious movement, citing their shared emphasis on freedom.{{sfn|Knight|2012|p=96}}

There are a number of similarities between the Church of the SubGenius and [[Discordianism]]. Eris, the goddess of chaos who is worshiped by adherents of the latter, is believed by members of the Church of the SubGenius to be the wife of Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 and an ally to humans. Like Discordianism, the Church of the SubGenius rejects absolute truth and embraces contradictions and paradoxes.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}} Religious scholar David Chidester of the [[University of Cape Town]] views the Church as a "Discordian offshoot",{{sfn|Chidester|2005|p=198}} and Kirby sees them as "a child of the Discordians".{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=48}} Both groups were heavily influenced by the writings of [[Robert Anton Wilson]], who is referred to by SubGenius members as "Pope Bob".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}}{{sfn|''The Daily Telegraph'', "Robert Anton Wilson"}} Kirby states that the two groups have elements of bricolage and absurdity in common, but the Church of the SubGenius more explicitly remixes pop culture.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}}

===Categorization===
Scholars often have difficulty defining the Church.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=109}} Most commentators have placed the Church in the category of "joke religions", which is usually seen as a pejorative description. Kirby sees this categorization as partially accurate because irony is an essential aspect of their faith.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=43}} Other terms used to describe the Church include "faux cult",{{sfn|Callahan|1996}} "[post-modern] cult",{{sfn|Batz|1995}} "satirical pseudoreligion",{{sfn|Stein|1993|p=179}} "sophisticated joke religion",{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=109}} "anti-religion religion",{{sfn|Scoblionkov|1998}} and "high parody of cultdom".{{sfn|Rea|1985}} Members of the Church, however, have consistently maintained that they practice a religion.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=98}} Stang has described the group as both "satire and a real stupid religion", and he contends that it is more honest about its nature than are other religions.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=107}}

Cusack states that the Church "must be accorded the status of a functional equivalent of religion, at the very least, if not 'authentic' religion".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} She sees it as "arguably a legitimate path to liberation", citing its culture jamming and activism against commercialism.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} Kirby posits that the Church is a religion masquerading as a joke, rather than the reverse: in her view, it is a spiritual manifestation of a cultural shift toward irony.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=43}} Alberts believes that there is broad agreement that the Church is fundamentally a different type of group than religions that date to antiquity; he prefers to use the term "fake religion" to describe the group. He sees it, along with Discordianism, as part of a group of "popular movements that look and feel like religion, but whose apparent excess, irreverence and arbitrariness seem to mock religion".{{sfn|Alberts|2008|p=126}} Knight characterizes the Church as "at once a postmodern spoof of religion and a viable system in its own right".{{sfn|Knight|2012|p=96}}

===Appraisal===
Kirby argues that the Church forms a counterpart to [[Jean Baudrillard]]'s concept of [[hyperreality]], arguing "they create, rather than consume, popular culture in the practice of their spirituality".{{sfn|Kirby|2012|pp=42–3}} She describes their remixing of popular culture sources as an "explicitly creative process",{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}} maintaining that it prompts the reader to adopt some of the group's views by forcing "the individual to reconsider normative methods of approaching the content".{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}} She states that the group attempts to "strip references of their original meaning without necessarily losing their status as icons".{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}}

In addition, Kirby sees the Church's goal as deconstructing "normative modes of thought and behavior" in American culture;{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=44}} she believes that it attempts to fight culturally ingrained thought patterns by shocking people.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}} She argues that traditional approaches to religion cast seriousness as a measure of devotion, an approach which she believes has failed in contemporary society. She feels that irony is a common value that has been ignored by most religions. By embracing the quality, she maintains, the Church of the SubGenius offers a more accessible worldview than many groups.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=43}}

Literature scholar Paul Mann of [[Pomona College]] is critical of the Church of the SubGenius. He notes that the Church purports to present the truth through absurdity and faults it for insufficiently examining the concept of truth itself.{{sfn|Mann|1999|p=156}} In addition, he believes that the group undermines its attempts to take a radical perspective by their "hysterical, literal, fantastic embrace" of criticism.{{sfn|Mann|1999|p=158}}

Anarchist writer [[Bob Black]], a former member, has criticized the Church, alleging that the group has come to be characterized by conformism and submission to authority. He believes that although it initially served to satirize cults, it later took on some of their aspects. In 1992, allegations of cult-like behavior also appeared in the newspaper ''[[Bedfordshire on Sunday]]'' after a spate of SubGenius-themed vandalism struck the English town of [[Bedford]].{{sfn|Leiby|1994}}

According to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Roman Catholic Church]], '''completed revelation''' is the doctrine that God has fulfilled and completed [[divine revelation]] in Jesus Christ, and there will be no new divine revelation until the [[Second Coming]].

==Eastern Orthodox Theology==

{{Empty section|date=February 2013}}

==Roman Catholic Theology==

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] believes Jesus Christ is the "fullness and mediator of all Revelations",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a1.htm#III |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The Revelation of God |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that no new divine revelation will come until the [[Second Coming]].&lt;ref name="vatican1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a1.htm#66 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The Revelation of God |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also believes that God gradually leads the church into a deeper understanding of divine revelation, such as by private revelations,&lt;ref name="vatican1"/&gt; which do not fulfill, complete, substitute or supersede divine revelation but help one live by divine revelation.&lt;ref name="vatican2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a1.htm#67 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The Revelation of God |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516225514/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a1.htm |archivedate=2012-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The church does not obligate the faithful to believe in, follow, or publish private revelations, whether they're approved or otherwise.&lt;ref name="vatican2"/&gt;

'''Díyá'u'lláh''' (alternate spelling: Zíyá'u'lláh) (15 August 1864 - 30 October 1898) was one of the sons of [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. He was the second son of his father's second wife [[Bahá'u'lláh's family#Fatimih|Fatimih]] (also known as Mahd-i-'Ulya). He was born in [[Edirne]] (modern day Adrianople).&lt;ref name="PSmithNurifamily"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bahá'u'lláh gave the title ''Ghusn-i-Athar'' (meaning "Most Pure Branch" or "Purer Branch") to his son [[Mírzá Mihdí]].&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Aghsán |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Mírzá Mihdí's death in 1870, Bahá'u'lláh gave the same title to his other son Díyá'u'lláh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Behai|first=Shua Ullah|authorlink=Shua Ullah Behai|page=261|editor1-last=Stetson|editor1-first=Eric|date=December 5, 2014|title=A Lost History of the Baha'i Faith: The Progressive Tradition of Baha'u'llah's Forgotten Family|url=http://www.voxhumri.com/books/a-lost-history-of-the-bahai-faith/|publisher=Vox Humri Media|isbn=978-0692331354|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927005108/http://www.voxhumri.com/books/a-lost-history-of-the-bahai-faith/|archivedate=September 27, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not confirmed by Bahá'í sources.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

He swayed between his two brothers, [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] and [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí|Muhammad `Alí]], in their argument.  He married Thurayyá Samandarí, daughter of Shaykh [[Kázim-i-Samandar]] and sister of Taráz’u’lláh Samandarí, a [[Hand of the Cause of God]]. The marriage was childless. Díyá'u'lláh died on 30 October 1898 in Haifa Palestine, and was posthumously{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} labeled a [[Covenant-breaker]].&lt;ref name="coc145"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|2000|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b_p528"&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death in 1898, Díyá'u'lláh was initially buried next to his father at the [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh]] at the [[Mansion of Bahjí]].  However, having been declared a Covenant-breaker, Díyá'u'lláh's remains were disinterred in 1965 in a process the [[Universal House of Justice]] described as a "purification... from past contamination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Marks |editor1-first= Geoffry W. |date=1996 |title=Messages from the Universal House of Justice 1963-86: The Third Epoch of the Formative Age |url= http://bahai-library.com/uhj_messages_1963-86_full&amp;chapter=3#66 |location= |publisher= Baha'i Publishing Trust |page=66 |isbn= 978-0877432395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website includes several debates between Ali Sina and Muslims, among them are prominent scholars such as [[Edip Yuksel]]&lt;ref&gt;''Peacemaker's Guide to Warmongers: Exposing Robert Spencer, David Horowitz, and other Enemies of Peace'' by Edip Yuksel, 2010, Published by Brainbow Press, {{ISBN|978-0-9796715-3-1}}; p. 145-267&lt;/ref&gt; and Yamin Zakaria of the ICSSA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050404220129/http://icssa.org/yameendebate.html ICSSA, Exposing Blindness of "Freethinkers" about Islam]; A Debate between YAMIN ZAKARIA and ALI SINA; Published: February 27, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faithfreedom.org/category/features/debates/ |title=Debates |publisher=FaithFreedom.org |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016170648/http://www.faithfreedom.org/category/features/debates/ |archivedate=October 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sina’s contention is that Islam promotes hate and disunity, and thus poses an impediment to peace. According to his website, he has issued a challenge that should anyone prove him wrong he will publicly acknowledge his error and withdraw his charges against Islam, and will pay $50,000 to that person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/Muslim-Mindset-The-hatred-is-in-Muhammad-himself#article=0QjM0QzQ0MTVBQUVFNEQ4QTc4MTdGNzNDQ0YwMDdGMjg= Sina's Challenge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204022026/http://m.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/Muslim-Mindset-The-hatred-is-in-Muhammad-himself#article=0QjM0QzQ0MTVBQUVFNEQ4QTc4MTdGNzNDQ0YwMDdGMjg= |date=2016-02-04 }}, Jerusalem Post&lt;/ref&gt;

==WikiIslam==
[[Image:Wikiislam logo.png|right|thumb|upright|WikiIslam-logo]]
In September 2006, Faith Freedom International launched&lt;ref&gt;On Monday Sept 4, 2006, [http://www.wikiislam.net/wiki/WikiIslam:About#History (WikiIslam) was opened to the public.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001032509/http://www.wikiislam.net/wiki/WikiIslam:About#History |date=2015-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiIslam, a community-edited [[wiki]] collecting critical material about Islam.&lt;ref name="CIWI"&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/p02g0g86387j4t62/ ''Cyber-Islamophobia? The case of WikiIslam''], Journal: ''Contemporary Islam'', publisher ''Springer Netherlands'', ISSN 1872-0218 (Print) 1872-0226&lt;/ref&gt; According to the FAQ section on the website, "the main difference between WikiIslam and Wikipedia is that opinions critical of Islam are not censored on WikiIslam for political correctness".&lt;ref name="CIWI"/&gt; Due to the controversial nature of the website, it has been subject to vandalism, due to which increased security measures have been employed.

WikiIslam was the subject of an article in the 7/2007 issue of the journal ''Contemporary Islam'', entitled "Cyber-Islamophobia? The case of WikiIslam",&lt;ref name="CIWI"/&gt; which argues that the website commits selection bias by collecting only negative or critical material.&lt;ref name="CIWI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Compared to “Muslim homepages”, i.e. those set up by believing Muslims, WikiIslam contains only negative and critical examples. This bias is clearly represented in the section called “laughing with the prophet”, which presents stories and reports from the life of prophet Muhammad (i.e. hadith reports)." ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The article states that "In relation to the criteria set up by the [[Runnymede Trust]] ... it should be quite easy to label most of the material published on WikiIslam as expressions of [[Islamophobia]]." [[Göran Larsson (theologian)|Göran Larsson]] adds that "[m]y impression is that the stories reported by WikiIslam have merely been selected to show that Muslims are ignorant, backward or even stupid."&lt;ref name="CIWI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Islamophobia: A Challenge For Us All, p. 5, Runnymede Trust (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the presence of material obtained from other websites, such as [[MEMRI]], the article notes that "it becomes much more difficult to argue that all information posted on WikiIslam is Islamophobic by nature".&lt;ref name="CIWI"/&gt;

In August 2008, the WikiIslam site was moved to a new server and since then it has been operating independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://wikiislam.net/wiki/WikiIslam |title=WikiIslam |access-date=2016-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624085834/http://wikiislam.net/wiki/WikiIslam |archive-date=2016-06-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3142">The term '''Free Bahá'ís''' has been used by or about a small number of [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] that have attempted [[Bahá'í Faith|schism]] from the main body of believers of the Bahá'í Faith. More specifically, it is a form of belief that rejects the authority of [[Shoghi Effendi]], appointed in 1921 to lead the community following the death of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]]. 

The term was first used by [[Hermann Zimmer]], who revived the earlier claims of [[Ruth White (Bahá'í author)|Ruth White]] that the ''[[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá]]'' was forged. White's claim was widely rejected by other Bahá'ís of the time, including Bahá'ís who, like her, were enemies of Shoghi Effendi.&lt;ref name=Covenant /&gt;&lt;ref name="child-covenant"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taherzadeh |first= Adib | authorlink= Adib Taherzadeh |year=2000 |title=The Child of the Covenant |publisher=George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=0-85398-439-5 |pages= 299–300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The A to Z of the Baha'i Faith | first = Hugh C. | last = Adamson | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | year = 2009 | isbn = 0810868539 |p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="covenant-bahaullah"&gt;{{cite book |author= Taherzadeh, Adib |authorlink= Adib Taherzadeh |year= 1972 |title= The Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-344-5 |page= 347 }}&lt;/ref&gt; White was able to gather the support of a single Bahá'í in Germany, Wilhelm Herrigel, who took up her cause; only a few Bahá'ís followed him, and most repudiated him following his death in 1932.&lt;ref name="balyuzi"&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Honor of the Late Hasan M.

Zimmer wrote a [[polemic]] attacking the [[Bahá'í administration]] in 1971, entitled ''A Fraudulent Testament devalues the Bahá'í Religion into Political Shogism'', which was widely distributed by [[Evangelical]] [[Protestant]] organizations in Germany, and later translated into English and distributed worldwide.&lt;ref name=Covenant&gt;{{cite web |url= https://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant |title= Covenant, The, and Covenant-breaker  |last= Momen |first= Moojan|authorlink= Moojan Momen |date= 1995 |website= Bahá'í Library Online |publisher= |access-date= December 22, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="balyuzi" /&gt; Zimmer attempted to establish a group called "Free Bahá'ís" or the "World Union of Universal Religion and Universal Peace" along with Charles Seeburger of Philadelphia, but it is not clear that it actually came into being.

The '''Irani''' are an ethno-religious community in [[South Asia]]; they belong to the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] who emigrated from [[Iran]] to [[South Asia]] in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Emigration of Iranian Elites to India during the 16-18th centuries | url = http://asiecentrale.revues.org/480 | accessdate = 2013-12-17| first = Haneda, | last = Masashi }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are culturally, linguistically, ethnically and socially distinct from the [[Parsis]], who&amp;nbsp;– although also Zoroastrians&amp;nbsp;– emigrated to the Indian subcontinent from [[Greater Iran]] many centuries before the Iranis did.&lt;!-- no need to be more precise than this. Neither the precise date nor the precise location are known --&gt;

==Distinction from Parsis==

The Parsis and Iranis are considered legally distinct. A 1909 ''[[obiter dictum]]'' relating to the Indian Zoroastrians, also observed that Iranis (of the now defunct [[Bombay Presidency]]) were not obliged to uphold the decisions of the then regulatory Parsi [[Panchayati raj|Panchayat]]. Some of the Irani community speaks an [[ethnolect]] called [[Zoroastrian Dari language|Zoroastrian Dari]]. However, the two communities increasingly intermarry and are said to have been "integrated well" with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What sets Zoroastrian-Iranis apart | accessdate = 2018-06-24 | first = Padmaja | last = Shastri | url = https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/What-sets-Zoroastrian-Iranis-apart/articleshow/572604.cms }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Although the term 'Irani' is first attested during the [[Mughal era]], most Iranis are descended from immigrants who left Iran and migrated to the Indian subcontinent during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. At the time, Iran was ruled by the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]] and religious [[persecution of Zoroastrians]] was widespread. The descendants of those immigrants remain ethnically and culturally closer to the [[Zoroastrians in Iran|Zoroastrians of Iran]], in particular to the Zoroastrians of [[Yazd]] and [[Kerman]], than to Parsis in India. Consequently, many Iranis still speak the [[Sorani]] or [[Dari (Zoroastrian)|Dari]] dialects of the Zoroastrians of those provinces.

As is also the case for the Parsis, the Iranis predominately settled the west-coast of India, in the states of [[Gujarat]] and [[Maharashtra]]. A concentration of their people live in and around the city of [[Mumbai]].

==Notable Iranis==
Irani is the generic surname for the community. Some families have adopted surnames related to their ancestral hometowns in Iran, such as Kermani, Yezdani, Khosravi, Faroodi, and Jafrabadi.

Notable members of the Irani community include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14595">'''Iyaláwo''' is a term in the [[Yoruba language]] that literally means Mother of Mysteries or Mother of Wisdom (''Ìyá'': “mother”; ''awó'' “mysteries"). Some adherents use the term "Mamalawo," which is a partially anglicized version of the Yoruba term, Iyaláwo. '''Ìyánífá''' is a Yoruba word that can be translated as Mother (''Ìyá'') has (''ní'') [[Ifá]] or Mother in Ifá. 

==Differences between terms==
While Iyaláwo and Ìyánífá are often used interchangeably, the terms have different denotations and connotations. The term Iyanífa specifically relates to Ifá and could indicate that a female undertakes Ifa divination or is a custodian of Ifa in a personal or professional capacity; the term may also indicate that a woman has had Itefa or itelodu initiation.  The term Iyaláwo indicates a woman who has knowledge of sacred wisdom that may include Ifa but goes beyond Ifá . The significance of the Iyaláwo in Yoruba cosmology is said to extend to its creator, Odù. In ''The Architects of Existence: Àjẹ́ in Yoruba Cosmology, Ontology, and Orature'', Teresa N. Washington says of Odù: “Odù, as ''the'' Àjẹ́, is the consummate Iyaláwo: The mysteries of the Cosmos swirl in the core of her being.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=qBXIAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=GBS.PP1|title=The Architects of Existence: Aje in Yoruba Cosmology, Ontology, and Orature|last=Washington|first=Teresa N.|publisher=Oya's Tornado|year=2014|isbn=978-0991073016|location=|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another term, Apetibi , is sometimes confused with Iyanifa or Iyalawo but is not the same. An Apetibi is considered a wife of Orunmila or a Babalawo. An apetibi is not initiated into the mysteries of Ifa and has not received Itefa or itelodu levels of initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Iyanifa Women of Wisdom|last=Kumari|first=Ayele|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ifá is a [[divination]] system that represents the oracular utterance of Odù, who is also known as [[Odùduwà]]. Linguist and cultural historian Modupe Oduyoye reveals that the meaning of Odùduwà is  ''Odù-ó dá ìwà'' "Oracular utterance created existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IsQhCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP13&amp;lpg=PP13&amp;dq=our+mothers+our+powers+our+texts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=79UZU0IhgQ&amp;sig=w6s-Wf7rh7s7uc414O3lE_WJmbo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5w63PgPnUAhVBJiYKHYu_DcQQ6AEIVTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=our%20mothers%20our%20powers%20our%20texts&amp;f=false|title=Our Mothers, Our Powers, Our Texts: Manifestations of Aje in Africana Literature|last=Quoted in: Washington|first=Teresa N.|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0991073054|location=|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system that Odù devised for human beings to manifest their destiny is called Odù Ifá, and the chief emissary of Odù Ifá is [[Orisha]] [[Orunmila]]. Both Babaláwo and Iyanífa use Ifá and its tools, including the [[divination|divining]] chain known as ''Opele'' or the sacred palm nuts called ''Ikin'', on the traditionally wooden divination tray called ''[[Opon Ifá]]'',  to help their clients better understand their paths in life.

==Historical accounts of Iyalawo and Iyanifa ==
The history of women casting Ifa is well-documented in the ese Ifa. Oyeronke Olajubu's ''Women in the Yoruba Religious Sphere'' analyzes an ese Ifa of Eji Ogbe in which [[Orunmila]] is asked why his daughter is not practicing Ifa. When he replies that she is female, he is informed that that is no taboo. Following this, Orunmila's daughter studied Ifa and "From then on women have studied Ifa / They prescribe sacrifice / They are initiated into the Ifa corpus."&lt;ref&gt;Women in the Yoruba Religious Sphere, page 116&lt;/ref&gt;  A verse in Iwori Meji mentions that Orunmila's daughter is named Alara and that she underwent an apprenticeship from Orunmila. When he had a son, she was responsible for a large part of her younger brother's training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Iwe Fun Odu Ifa|last = Agele Fawesagu Agbovi|first = |publisher = Kilombo Productions|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Arugba Ifa, mother of Onibogi, the 8th Alaafin of Oyo, is documented as introducing Ifa to Oyo .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Yorubas from the Earliest of Times to the British Protectorate|last=Johnson|first=Samuel|publisher=Nigeria Bookshops|year=1921|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arugba Ifa initiated the Alado of Ato into Ifa, as well. The Alado later initiated the priests of Oyo into Ifa.  The sacred odu Oturupon Irete cites a woman named Oluwo being initiated into Ifa after giving birth to a son by Oduduwa. That son became known as the Ooni.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Ifa Odu Odi Ogbe speaks of a woman divining and performing ritual sacrifice  for Orunmila by the name Eruko-ya-l'egan o d'Oosa also known as Orisa Oke. The Odù Ifá describes how an Ìyánífá called Ugbin Ejo divines for Òfún Méji and also eventually becomes the mother of Ògbóni.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ifism: The Complete Works of Orunmila|last=Ibie|first=C. Osamaro|publisher=Efehi|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=247–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Royal mothers of Yoruba rulers were also necessarily Iyaláwo and Ìyánífá.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=qBXIAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=GBS.PP1|title=The Architects of Existence: Aje In Yoruba Cosmology, Ontology, and Orature|last=Washington|first=Teresa N.|publisher=Oya's Tornado|year=2014|isbn=978-0991073016|location=|pages=179–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Biodun Adediran in "Women, Rituals, and Politics in Pre-Colonial Yorubaland" reveals that the Ìyá Mọlẹ̀ serves as the Yoruba rulers' “personal ''Ifa'' priestess and head of all ''Ifa'' priests.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qBXIAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Architects of Existence: Aje in Yoruba Cosmology, Ontology, and Orature|last=Quoted in: Washington|first=Teresa N.|publisher=Oya's Tornado|year=2014|isbn=978-0991073016|location=|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another  documented African Iyalawo was Agbaye Arabinrin Oluwa, who lived c. 200 AD in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Iyanfia: Women of Wisdom, page 362&lt;/ref&gt;  Chief Fama Aina Adewale Somadhi, a contemporary and prominent Yoruba born Iyalawo, was initiated in 1988 by Chief ‘Fagbemi Ojo Alabi, the late Araba of Ayetoro town, Egbado, and the Oluwo (or High Priest) of Ogun State, Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals to the Yoruba Religion Orisha Worship|last=Fama|first=Chief|publisher=Orunmila Publications|year=1990|isbn=0971494908|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first documented American Iyalawo was Dr. D'Haifa Odufora Ifatogun, who was initiated in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Iyanifa: Women of Wisdom, Chapter Historical Notes, pg 352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://eleda.org/blog/2002/10/27/the-guardian-conscience-nurtured-by-truth/&lt;/ref&gt;  

Mattie Curtis-Iyanifa Ifakemi Oyesanya, initiated in the Oyesanya Compound by Araba Oyesanya and Ayoka Oyesanya , a student of Chief Fama's, were the first African American women  initiated into Ifa in 1993. The first Lucumi Iyaonifas initiatied were María Cuesta Conde and Nidia Aguila de León in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;CITIZENSHIP, RELIGION AND REVOLUTION IN CUBA by Carolyn E. Watson, University of New Mexico, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
Iyalawo undergo training in the memorization and interpretation of the 256 Odu or mysteries, as well as in the numerous verses or Ese of Ifá. Traditionally, the Iyalawo usually have additional professional specialties. For instance, several would also be [[herbalist]]s, while others would specialize in extinguishing the troubles caused by Ajogun. 

The Iyalawos are, however, generally trained in the determination of problems, or to divine how good fortune can be maintained, and the application of both spiritual and related secular diagnosis and  solutions. Their primary function is to assist people in finding, understanding, and being in alignment with one's individual destiny until they experience spiritual wisdom as a part of their daily experience. 

The Iyalawo is charged with helping people develop the discipline and character that supports such spiritual growth called "Iwa Pele", or good character. This is done by identifying the client's spiritual [[destiny]], or [[Ori (Yoruba)|Ori]], and developing a spiritual blueprint which can be used to support, cultivate, and live out that destiny.

== Lineage variations of Iyanifa ==

The position of Iyalawo is found in both [[West Africa]] and in the [[Americas]]. Every town, country and lineage has different customs, although most towns in [[Yorubaland]] initiate women at present.  The priesthood of women is denied by many  in the Lucumí tradition in [[Cuba]]. As with the various lineages throughout the Caribbean and the Americas, the Lucumí lineage is distinct from African lineages, as can be seen in an accord reached by a group of Lucumí Oba Oriatés, Babalaos, and Olorichás on June 2, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eleda.org/obaoriatecouncil/|title = Lucumi Oba Oriate Council Agreement|date = 2010|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Ramos|first = Willie}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Initially, the Cuban lineage dominated the United States due to the large influx of Cuban immigrants settling in its large cities. As a result, the position of Iyanifa did not become well known in the States until the 1990s, when African American women began to go to Africa for their initiations.  In the book ''Orisa Devotion as World Religion'', Dr. Eason recounts how in 1992, the King of Oyotunji, [[Adefunmi]], under pressure from women at [[Oyotunji]] to allow them to be initiated as Ifá priests, went to Benin, having assumed that Ile Ife did not initiate women at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Eason, Ikulomi Djisovi. “Historicizing Ifá Culture in Oyotunji African Village.” In Orisa Devotion as World Religion: The Globalization of Yoruba Religious Culture, edited by Jacob Kehinde Olupona and Terry Rey, 278–85. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  

It is noted that women have always received Ifa initiations in West Africa through Ifa, Afa, or Fa, as it is known in various lineages.  

The pressure began in Oyotunji after Iyanifa Ifafunmike Osunbunmi  was initiated in Osogbo,  Nigeria, in 1995 by the babalawo Ifayemi Elebuibon, the Araba of Osogbo. In the book "Iyanifa: Women of Wisdom", she recounts the initial resistance of Oyotunji village because its people did not know women could be initiated up to that point.  

Ode Remo is an example of a Yoruba kingdom that does not currently offer Itefa to women. It should be noted, however, that Ode Remo demonstrates a history of once having done so, as noted in the book "Women in the Yoruba Religion"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00E76MMNG/ref=mp_s_a_1_fkmr0_1?qid=1418398750&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0&amp;pi=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70|title = Amazon|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Ode Remo author Oluwo Olotunji Somorin. This claim is further substantiated by other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://oderemoiyanifacorner.blogspot.com/2009_04_01_archive.html|title = OdeRemo Iyanifa Corner|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are hundreds of women initiated as Iyalawos or Iyanifas in West Africa and the diaspora, according to the Ifa Women's Association. American women  are the fastest growing group of priests in the tradition . This is due to American women having advanced degrees and the financial resources to support themselves and finance trips to Africa. They are still challenged by some houses in the Cuban Lukumi  community, houses generally headed by males, which actively oppose their ministries.&lt;ref&gt;http://cubarights.blogspot.com/2011/05/babalawos-womens-meeting-in-holguin.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many women have been reported to be ostracized, harassed, and stripped of credentials if they dare to pursue Itefa. Some have reported to have their lives threatened for doing so, creating fear among and compliance within the other women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Iyanifa : Women of Wisdom|last = Kumari|first = Ayele|publisher = |year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small community of Iyaonifas in the Cuban Lukumi community, however. María Cuesta Conde and Nidia Aguila de León were the first Iyanifas initiated in Cuba by Victor Betancourt Estrada in March, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;El fenómeno Iyónifá en Cuba,” Consenso 1 (2005), available from www.consenso.org/01/articulos/02_01.shtml, internet; accessed 8 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Matanzas Babalawo Ernesto Acosta Cediez went on to initiate the Venezuelan lawyer, Alba Marina Portales, as an Iyanifa in 2002 with the help of Estrada.&lt;ref&gt;Mirta Fernández, “Las mujeres penetran en Ifá,” El Caiman Barbudo 345, 14 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The following quote from Estrada explains his decision: "In the Ifá room, initiation to the feminine orisha Odú, the mother of all living beings and the first woman diviner (she who married Orúnmila and had sixteen children who were converted into the sixteen Olodú or major signs of Ifá), is
represented." This demonstrates that to consecrate any diviner, masculine and feminine participation is required. &lt;ref&gt;Betancourt Estrada, “Respuestas a Felipe Ifaláde,” 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Ifá verse ''Oshe Tura'' requires that women and their power be recognized and specifically that it is forbidden to leave women out of religious activities. [[Oshun]], a female [[Orisha]] who is featured in Oshe Tura, "encountered men who would not recognize her, so she established a sect of women called ''Iyami Aje'' to counterbalance the injustice. The male Orishas  were rendered powerless, and were not effective until Oshun was included amongst their number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://101.myyoruba.com/oshun-odu-ose-tura/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325113903/http://101.myyoruba.com/oshun-odu-ose-tura/ |archivedate=2015-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8438">'''Jeungsanism''' (증산교 Jeungsangyo) is occasionally used as a synonym of [[Jeung San Do]], a Korean [[new religious movement]],&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Lee Chi-ran,[https://web.archive.org/web/20140413124433/http://manak.org.in/wp-content/uploads/pdf-manak/The%20Emergence%20of%20National%20Religions%20in%20Korea.pdf "The Emergence of National Religions in Korea"], 21.&lt;/ref&gt; but most Korean and Western scholars use it to designate a family of more than 100 Korean new religious movements that recognize Kang Jeungsan ([[Gang Il-Sun]]) as the incarnation of the Supreme God of the Universe, [[Sangje]].&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Introvigne, [https://wrldrels.org/2017/02/26/daesoon-jinrihoe "Daesoon Jinrihoe"], World Religions and Spirituality Project, Virginia Commonwealth University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and Divisions==
[[File:Donggok Clinic.jpg|thumb|Donggok Clinic, where Kang died in 1909, in its present heavily restored condition]]
Kang Jeungsan, recognized by his disciples as the Supreme God incarnated, died on June 24, 1909 at the Donggok Clinic he had established in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Introvigne, "Daesoon Jinrihoe," cit. See also Key Ray Chong, “Kang Jeungsan: Trials and Triumphs of a Visionary Pacifist/Nationalist, 1894-1909," in The Daesoon Academy of Sciences (ed.), ''Daesoonjinrihoe: A New Religion Emerging from Traditional East Asian Philosophy'', Yeoju: Daesoon Jinrihoe Press, 2016, 17-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Kang had not clearly designated a successor, and both his main disciples and some of his relatives established separate branches, which in turn separated into further rival organizations, generating more than 100 religious orders within the general family of Jeungsanism.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Introvigne, "Daesoon Jinrihoe," cit.&lt;/ref&gt; All recognize Kang as [[Sangje]], the Supreme God of the Universe, and believe that he reordered the whole universe through his mission and rituals, buy they differ on who Kang's successors should have been. Some of them have divinized and worship as deities their own founders, or other leaders of Jeungsanism, in addition to Kang.&lt;ref&gt;See Lee Kang-o, “Chungsan-gyo: Its History, Doctrine and Ritual,” ''Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch'' 43 (1967): 28-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of branches trace their origins to Goh Pan-Lye (Subu, literally “Head Lady,” 1880-1935, although in Kang's circle there were two different "Subus"), a female disciple of Kang Jeungsan. Around September 1911, Goh gathered around her a number of Kang's followers. Eventually, Goh’s male cousin, Cha Gyeong-Seok (1880-1936), a leading disciple of Kang, became the leader of Goh's branch. Dissatisfied with this situation, Goh separated from Cha in 1919 and established her own new religion.&lt;ref&gt;See Lee, “Chungsan-gyo: Its History, Doctrine and Ritual,” cit.; Introvigne, "Daesoon Jinrihoe," cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1920s, Cha’s branch, known as [[Bocheon-gyo]], became the largest Korean new religious movement and possibly the largest religion in Korea, with some six million followers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pearson Flaherty, “Korean Millennial Movements,” in ''The Oxford Handbook of Millennialism'', edited by [[Catherine Wessinger]], Oxford: Oxford University Press 2016,{{ISBN|978-01-953010-5-2}}, 326-347 (335).&lt;/ref&gt; It declined rapidly after Cha's death in 1936, and fragmented into several competing group, as did Goh's organization. The largest among the branches claiming a lineage originating from Goh is [[Jeung San Do]], founded by Ahn Un-san (1922-2012), who established his first religious organization in 1945. After further divisions, Ahn founded Jeung San Do in 1974 together with his son, Ahn Gyeong-jeon (b. 1954).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeungsando.org/masters/ahn-un-san-his-holiness-the-jongdosanim/ "Taesang Jongdosanim"], official Web site of Jeung San Do.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeung San Do believes that, as Kang was God the Father, Goh, revered with the title of Tae-mo-nim, was God the mother and between 1926 and 1935 performed her own reordering of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.jsd.or.kr/dojeon/readen.php?mid=70 "Sahng-jeh-nim and Tae-mo-nim"], official Web site of Jeung San Do.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeung San Do is the movement within Jeungsanism with the most visible presence abroad, although it is not the largest branch in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;See Introvigne, "Daesoon Jinrihoe," cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another leading disciple of Kang Jeungsan was Kim Hyeong-Ryeol (1862-1932). He originally accepted Cha's leadership. In 1914, however, he left and established an independent religious order with Kang Jeungsan’s widow, Jeong (1874-1928). While Jeungsanism in general believes that Sangje remained for thirty years in the giant Maitreya Buddha statue at the [[Geumsansa]] temple before incarnating as Kang Jeungsan, Kim's branch taught that, after he died, Kang took to reside again in the statue. Kim gained some support for this belief among the Buddhist monks at Geumsansa, but in 1922 was expelled from the monastery by the abbot, an incident that led to the decline of his branch.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, “Chungsan-gyo: Its History, Doctrine and Ritual,” cit., 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kang-grave.jpg|thumb|Jeung San Beob Jong Gyo headquarters, graves of Kang Jeungsan and his wife]]
Another important branch emerged in the 1920s around Jo Cheol-Je, known to his disciples as Jo Jeongsan (1895-1958). Jo had never personally met Kang, but claimed to have received a revelation from him in 1917. Eventually, he was recognized as the mysterious successor Kang had announced in his prophecies by the deceased Kang’s sister (Seondol, ca. 1881-1942), mother (Kwon, 1850-1926) and daughter (Sun-Im, 1904-1959), although the daughter eventually started her own separate branch with her husband Kim Byeong-cheol (1905-1970).&lt;ref&gt;See Massimo Introvigne, "Daesoon Jinrihoe," cit.&lt;/ref&gt; Sun-Im's branch, known as Jeung San Beob Jong Gyo, is headquartered in Korea's [[North Jeolla]] province, and after protracted litigation with other branches obtained the mortal remains of Kang, which are currently at its headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Kang-o, “Chungsan-gyo: Its History, Doctrine and Ritual,” cit., 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Jo organized his movement as Mugeukdo in 1925, but had to disband it in 1941 due to the Japanese occupation of Korea and Japan's hostility to new religions. He reorganized it in 1948, and in 1950 changed its name into Taegeukdo, with headquarters in [[Busan]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, “Chungsan-gyo: Its History, Doctrine and Ritual,” cit., 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Jo died in 1958. His disciples continued as a single religious order until 1968, recognizing as Jo's successor Park Wudang (1918-1996, or 1917-1995 according to the [[lunar calendar]] normally used by the movement). In 1968, however, Park's authority was contested by a number of senior executives and by one of Jo's sons, Jo Yongnae, who opposed the reforms Park had introduced. The group opposed to Park kept the headquarters near Busan and the name Taegeukdo, while Park moved to Seoul and reorganized his branch in 1969 as [[Daesun Jinrihoe]] (Daesoon Jinrihoe).&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, "Daesoon Jinrihoe," cit&lt;/ref&gt; Although statistics are a matter of contention, Daesoon Jinrihoe seems to be the largest new religion in the Jeungsanism family, and possibly the largest Korean new religion in general.&lt;ref&gt;See Don Baker, "The Religious Revolution in Modern Korean History: From ethics to theology and from ritual hegemony to religious freedom," ''The Review of Korean Studies'', 3 (September 2006), 249–275 (255).&lt;/ref&gt; At Park's death in 1996, controversies erupted within Daesoon Jinrihoe between those advocating and those denying the deification of Park as a third divine figure, together with Kang and Jo. The branch that rejected the deification maintained the control of the headquarters in [[Yeoju]] and was followed by a large majority of the members, while another four branches (and possibly more) recognized Park as either a god or the Maitreya Buddha and separated from the main organization, with which two of them maintain, however, a dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cesnur.org/2006/korea.htm|title=Religions of Korea in Practice: A Summa on Korea's New (and Old) Religions|last=Introvigne|first=Massimo|work=Center for Studies on New Religions|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khara dupatta''' (کھڑا ڈپٹا) (upright [[stole (shawl)|stole]]) is the traditional [[wedding dress]] of [[Hyderabadi Muslim]] brides. It is an elaborate [[wedding]] ensemble comprising a [[kurta]] (tunic), [[chooridaar]] (extra-long slim pants that gather at the ankles), and a 6-yard [[dupatta]] (stole or [[veil]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wonderwoman.intoday.in/story/royal-dupattas-for-the-big-day/1/92854.html|title= Royal dupattas for the big day|author= Harsha Chawla|access-date= 15 May 2012|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120203164626/http://wonderwoman.intoday.in/story/royal-dupattas-for-the-big-day/1/92854.html|archive-date= 3 February 2012|dead-url= yes|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Early in the 17th century, [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] and [[Persia]]n craftsmen were invited to [[India]] by [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Nur Jahan|Empress Noor Jehan]] to craft a noble dress, that became particular only for family members of Mughal noble ladies . The art of ''dupatta'' crafting remain particular to Mughal descendants. Later when Mughal governor [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asaf Jah I|Nizam-ul-Mulk]] declared his autonomy over [[Hyderabad Deccan| Hyderabad Deccan Suba]], the ''begums'' of Nizam's family modified the creative style of Mughals to form ''Khara Dupatta''. Which was later practiced by general residents of Hyderabad. The montage gallery at [[Chowmahalla Palace]] exhibits the life style royal dresses of Nizams ''Begums'' which includes ''Kara Dupatta''.&lt;ref name="spectrum"&gt;{{cite news| title=The gorgeous dupatta| url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080525/spectrum/society1.htm| publisher=tribuneindia.com| date=25 May 2008| accessdate= 2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ensemble==

Sometimes the kurta is worn with a long, lightweight sleeveless overcoat or a shorter ''[[Koti (clothing)|koti]]'', a bolero-like waistcoat. The brides wears a matching [[ghoonghat]] (veil) over the head.

The dupatta is usually made of net material and [[embroidery|embroidered]] with [[zardozi]] work. The border of the dupatta has ''masala'' or a ribbon border with embroidered golden [[Motif (textile arts)|motif]]s.

The usual accompanying jewellery is:
* ''Tika'' - a medallion of uncut diamonds worn on the forehead and suspended by a string of pearls
* ''Jhoomar'' - a fan shaped ornament worn on the side of the head
* ''Nath'' - a nose ring with a large ruby bead flanked by two pearls
* ''Chintaak'' aka ''Jadaoo lachcha'' or ''Guluband'' - a choker studded with uncut diamonds and precious stones
* ''Kan phool'' - earrings that match the Chintaak and consist of a flower motif covering the ear lobe and a bell shaped ornament that is suspended from the flower. The weight of precious stones and gold in the Karan phool is held up by sahare or supports made of strands of pearls that are fastened into the wearers hair.
* [[Satlada]] - necklacke of seven strands of pearls set with emeralds, diamonds and rubies
* ''Ranihaar'' - a long strand of pearls with a wide pendant
* [[Jugni]] - necklace with several strands of pearls with a central pendant
* ''Gote'' - Shellac bangles studded with rhinestones and worn with gold colored glass bangles called ''sonabai''
* Payal - anklets
* ''Gintiyan'' - toe rings

==Wearing style==

The dupatta is draped with the very top part of the middle of the dupatta tucked into the back of the chooridaar. The dupatta is folded accordion pleats at both ends, which are held in place on the left shoulder with a [[brooch]]. The free ends of the dupatta are worn under the right shoulder and over the inside of the right elbow.

Born on July 18, 1946,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/noll-mark-1946&lt;/ref&gt; Noll is a graduate of [[Wheaton College, Illinois]] (B.A, English), the [[University of Iowa]] (M.A., English), [[Trinity Evangelical Divinity School]] (M.A., Church History and Theology), and [[Vanderbilt University]] (Ph.D, History of Christianity). Before coming to Notre Dame, he was on the faculty at [[Wheaton College, Illinois]] for twenty-seven years, where he taught in the departments of history and theology as McManis Professor of Christian Thought. While at Wheaton, Noll also co-founded (with [[Nathan O. Hatch|Nathan Hatch]]) and directed the [[Institute for the Study of American Evangelicals]] (ISAE), which ran from 1982 until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wheatonrecord.com/news/the-institute-for-the-study-of-american-evangelicals-closed/ Doty, J. The Institute for the Study of American Evangelicals closes.  ''The Wheaton Record'', November 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Noll is a prolific author and many of his books have earned considerable acclaim within the academic community. In particular, ''[[The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind]]'', a book about anti-intellectual tendencies within the American evangelical movement, was widely covered in both religious and secular publications.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, A. (2000, October). [https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2000/10/wolfe.htm The opening of the evangelical mind.] ''Atlantic Monthly, 286''(4), 55—76.&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a [[National Humanities Medal]] in the Oval Office by President George W. Bush in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Press Secretary, Press Release: [https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/11/20061108.html President Bush Announces 2006 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal Recipients] Retrieved 2007-11-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noll, along with other historians such as [[George Marsden]], [[Nathan O. Hatch]], and [[David Bebbington]], has greatly contributed to the world's understanding of evangelical convictions and attitudes, past and present. He has caused many scholars and lay people to realize more deeply the complications inherent in the question, "Is America a Christian nation?"&lt;ref&gt;Noll, Mark et al. (1989). ''The Search for Christian America''. Colorado Springs, CO:Helmers &amp; Howard Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, he co-signed [[Evangelicals and Catholics Together]], an ecumenical document that expressed the need for greater cooperation between evangelical and Catholic leaders in the United States.

From 2006 to 2016, Noll was a faculty member in Department of History at [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]]. He replaced the retiring George Marsden as Notre Dame's [[Francis A. McAnaney]] Professor of History.&lt;ref&gt;Moll, R. (2006, February 9).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2052">The '''Monshu''' (門主), or ''keeper of the gate'' is a term sometimes used in Japanese [[Buddhism]] to denote the head of a monastery, as in the case of [[Jōdo-shū]] and [[Tendai]] Buddhism, but in the case of the [[Nishi Hongan-ji]] sub-sect of [[Jōdo Shinshū]] Buddhism, it refers to the spiritual leader of the sect, and direct descendant of its founder [[Shinran]].

== Jōdo Shinshū ==

The Monshu in [[Jōdo Shinshū]] Buddhism was the guardian of [[Shinran]]'s mausoleum, as well as the head of the sect.  This position was started when the youngest daughter of Shinran, [[Kakushinni]], installed her son as the custodian of the small shrine which held Shinran's image and ashes at Ōtani, in [[Kyoto]].   In time the small shrine grew into what is now the [[Hongan-ji]] temples (east and west).  When the temple split into two temples, the West Temple, or ''Nishi Honganji'' continued to use the term Monshu, while the East Temple, or ''Higashi Hongan-ji'' gradually adopted the term "Hossu".

In the line of Monshu descendants, noteworthy Monshu include: 
* [[Kakunyo]] Shōnin (1270–1351), the 3rd Monshu, who first asserted the authority of the [[Hongan-ji]].
* [[Rennyo]] Shōnin (1415–1499), the 8th Monshu, the so-called "Great Reformer".
* [[Kyōnyo]] Shōnin (1558–1614), the 12th Monshu, oversaw the split of the Hongan-ji temple and founded the East Temple, while his younger brother, [[Junnyo]] Shōnin, took over administration of the West Temple.
* Junnyo Shōnin (1577–1630), the 12th Monshu (Nishi Hongan-ji), who build the [[Tsukiji Hongan-ji]] temple in Tokyo.
* Shōnyo Shōnin (1911–2002), the 23rd Monshu (Nishi Hongan-ji, noteworthy for his efforts to help spread Jōdo Shinshū teachings abroad.

As of writing, the current and 25th Monshu of the Nishi Hongan-ji temple is His Eminence Sennyo Shōnin (Ōtani Kōjun, born 1977). He succeeded his father Sokunyo Shōnin (Ōtani Kōshin, born 1945) on 6 June 2014.

It was established by the [[Amoraim|Amora]] [[Samuel of Nehardea]], one of the great sages of Babylon.
==History==
Samuel of [[Nehardea]] founded the academy, which in time attracted thousands of students. Along with [[Sura Academy]] founded by [[Abba Arika]] ("Rav"), it opened a new era  in which Babylon became the center of Judaism. After Abba Arika's death, many students from Sura moved to Nehardea.&lt;ref name="Jewish_Life"/&gt;

Despite the fact that [[Rav Kahana III]]'s [[Pum-Nahara Academy]] was subordinated to Sura Academy, from the time Arika died the heads of the Nehardea Academy came to visit Rav Kahana in [[Pum-Nahara]] with the intention of strengthening the ties between the two academies. This reinforcement of ties is attested by the fact that Kahana III gave his funeral oration to [[Rav Zevid of Nehardea]] at Pum-Nahara,&lt;ref&gt;B. [[Talmud]], Tractate [[Mo'ed Katan]], 27a&lt;/ref&gt; a funeral oration, most probably in conjunction with the fact that Rav Kahana III was a disciple of Rav Zevid of Nehardea.&lt;ref&gt;B. [[Talmud]], Tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]], 69b&lt;/ref&gt; We find, for example, R. [[Nahman of Nehardea]] coming to visit Rav Kahana III in Pum-Nahara on the eve of [[Yom Kippur]].&lt;ref&gt;B. [[Talmud]], Tractate Hullin, 95b&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible he came in order to participate with them in the prayers of the holy day.  

The academy had a special custom to show respect for the sages of The [[Land of Israel]]: When a guest came from the Land of Israel, he taught in the presence of the dean and all students. After the class ended, a long and lively debate was conducted in which the students would inundate the guest with academic questions.&lt;ref name="Jewish_Life"/&gt;

Among the scholars who attended the Nehardea Academy, there were known [[Amoraim]] sages cited in the [[Talmud]], such as R. [[Shimi of Nehardea]],&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Yoma]]&lt;/ref&gt; R. [[Dimi of Nehardea]], Rav Zevid of Nehardea, and [[Amemar]]. In many Talmud citations,&lt;ref&gt;B. [[Talmud]], Tractate [[Bava Batra]], 31a, and more&lt;/ref&gt; there is a mention of Nehardea's academy methods, however Amemar states that despite the fact that he is a Nehardean, he thinks otherwise. It is unclear whether he meant that Nehardea's academy thinks otherwise and not as what is known to be the methods, or was he an independent in his thinking.
{{Eras of the Halakha}}

After the death of Samuel, the academy split. The academy itself, headed by [[Rav Huna]], a disciple of Samuel, moved to [[Sura (city)|Sura]], while another student of Abba Arika and Shmuel, [[Judah ben Ezekiel]], founded the [[Pumbedita Academy]]. However, Judah ben Ezekiel and his followers regarded Rav Huna as ''Gedol haDor'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=26602&amp;hilite=5951765a-9385-4fda-b82e-13f3168c71e1&amp;st=%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%91%D7%AA+%D7%A0%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%90&amp;pgnum=9 שיחות לנוער]&lt;/ref&gt; until upon his death in 297 ([[Hebrew calendar]]: ד"א נ"ח or ד'נ"ח ).&lt;ref&gt;'''Yud Shin Tzuri''', [http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39458&amp;hilite=c4675da0-1bb8-4828-b635-c0ae25759af5&amp;st=%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%91%D7%AA+%D7%A0%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%90&amp;pgnum=20 Rav Ashi], p. 19 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, where there is disagreement among scholars, we find the Nehardea academy practicing [[Raba bar Rav Huna]] view,&lt;ref&gt;B. [[Talmud]], Tractate Hullin, 50b&lt;/ref&gt; and it may have to do with the fact that his son was the head of the academy and one of its leaders.

'''Operation Black Thunder''' is the name given to two operations that took place in [[India]] in the late 1980s to flush out remaining Sikh militants from the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] using 'Black Cat' commandos of the [[National Security Guards]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/NSG.html National Security Guards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006005622/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/NSG.html |date=2012-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Operation Blue Star]], these attacks were on [[Kharku]] sikhs who were based in the Golden Temple in Amritsar, [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]].

==Golden Temple==
The militants were able to claim a safe haven in the most sacred place for the Sikhs due to the whole or part support received by them from the key sikh religious leaders and  institutions such as the [[SGPC]], [[AISSF]] and Jathedar (head) of the [[Akal Takht]]. The support was either voluntary or forced by using violence or threat of violence. The evidence of resorting to violence was found by the security forces later on after Operation Black Thunder when hundreds of bodies of tortured and killed opponents were found buried under the Akal Takht and other places.&lt;ref name="FairGanguly2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fair|first1=C. Christine|last2=Ganguly|first2=Šumit|title=Treading on hallowed ground: counterinsurgency operations in sacred spaces|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2E1NpYuOrsC&amp;pg=PA41|accessdate=19 June 2010|date=September 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-534204-8|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden temple complex afforded the militants based inside a facade of fighting a "''holy war''". It also provided the militants access to new potential recruits from among the visitors. Several multi storied buildings were located around the Parikrama (walkway) around the reservoir of the temple that provided rooms and offices that were taken over by the militants. The temple complex also provided logistical advantage to the militants with easy access to food, water and communication lines. Further the sanctity of the Golden temple provided protection from arrests by the security forces who preferred not to enter the Temple premises so as not to hurt the religious sentiments of the Sikhs. Even the spies were not being sent due to the fear of them being captured, tortured and killed inside.&lt;ref name="FairGanguly2008"/&gt;

==Operation Black Thunder I==

The first Operation Black Thunder took place on 30 April 1986. About 200 radical sikh militants had been occupying the temple premises for the last 3 months.&lt;ref name="NYT_Black"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weishan |first1=Steven R. |title=Indian policemen raid Sikh temple |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/01/world/indian-policemen-raid-sikh-temple.html |accessdate=5 July 2018 |publisher=New York Times |date=1 May 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police operation was initiated one day after the radicals occupying the temple declared the formation of the independent Sikh nation of [[Khalistan]].&lt;ref name="NYT_Black"/&gt; About 300 [[National Security Guards]] commandos stormed the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine of the Sikhs, along with 700 [[Border Security Force]] troops and captured about 200 Sikh militants.&lt;ref name=BT1&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961349,00.html India Deliverance], [[TIME]], 1986-05-12&lt;/ref&gt; One person was killed and two were injured. During the progress of the operation no major resistance was reported at any point. About 70 radicals led by a religious fundamentalist had taken shelter in a holy sanctuary in the Golden temple. All of them finally surrendered just before dawn.&lt;ref name="NYT_Black"/&gt; The operation, which lasted eight hours, was approved by then Chief minister of Punjab [[Surjit Singh Barnala]] of [[Shiromani Akali Dal]].&lt;ref name=BT1/&gt; The operation had full support by moderate sikh leaders and several leaders praised the police action for ''flushing out terrorists, separatists and anti-faith elements.''&lt;ref name="NYT_Black"/&gt;

==Operation Black Thunder II==
[[File:Operation black thunder india.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Arms recovered from surrendered militants]]  
'''Operation Black Thunder II''' (sometimes just referred to as Operation Black Thunder)  began on 9 May 1988&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/11/world/gandhi-under-pressure-to-oust-sikhs-from-temple.html Gandhi Under Pressure to Oust Sikhs From Temple][[The New York Times]], 1988-05-11&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Amritsar]] and ended with the surrender of the militants on 18 May. The operation was commanded by [[Kanwar Pal Singh Gill]] who was the  DGP of [[Punjab Police (India)|Punjab Police]]. [[Sniper]]s were used in this operation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/14/world/troops-in-punjab-enter-sikh-temple-complex.html Troops in Punjab Enter Sikh Temple Complex][[The New York Times]], 1988-05-14&lt;/ref&gt;  Compared to [[Operation Blue Star]], little damage was inflicted on the Golden Temple.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/18/world/indian-commandos-close-in-on-sikhs.html INDIAN COMMANDOS CLOSE IN ON SIKHS], [[The New York Times]], 1988-05-18&lt;/ref&gt;  In what was reported as a successful operation, around 200 millitants surrendered, 41 were killed.
Gill stated that he did not want to repeat the mistakes made by the Indian army during Operation Blue Star.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/19/world/sikhs-surrender-to-troops-at-temple.html Sikhs Surrender to Troops at Temple], [[The New York Times]], 1988-05-19&lt;/ref&gt;  This operation was described as a severe setback to the [[Anandpur Resolution]] implementation movement. In contrast to prior operations, minimum force was used under full public scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z9GG4__JJNwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA398 Terrorism in context By Martha Crenshaw]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is remembered for the free access the news media was provided unlike during [[Operation Blue Star]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=fba3dc2a-db08-405e-8506-f220d7690d47 Black Thunder’s silver lining]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[The Hindustan Times]], 2008-05-13&lt;/ref&gt; The day after the militants surrendered, nine reporters were allowed into the Temple complex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/20/world/at-golden-temple-of-sikhs-the-debris-of-battle.html At Golden Temple of Sikhs, the Debris of Battle][[The New York Times]], 1988-05-20&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kirtan]]'' was resumed at the Golden Temple on 23 May 1988 after a two-week break during this operation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/23/world/reporter-s-notebook-at-sikh-temple-an-uncertain-song-returns.html At Sikh Temple, an Uncertain Song Returns], [[The New York Times]], 1988-05-23&lt;/ref&gt;

While Operation Blue Star was widely considered poorly executed and shambolic because of the egregious loss of civilian lives and the damage done to both the Golden Temple and Sikh relations with the [[Indian government|government]] (culminating in the [[assassination]] of [[Indira Gandhi]] by her bodyguards and [[anti-Sikh riots]]), Operation Black Thunder was far more successful with the [[blockade]] tactics paying dividends, and has been credited with breaking the back of the Sikh separatist movement.  Soon after this operation, the Indian Government banned the use of religious shrines for political and military purposes and increased penalties for the possession and use of illegal weapons, as part of its strategy to  fight extremism in the Punjab region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/29/world/india-bans-the-political-and-military-use-of-shrines.html India Bans the Political and Military Use of Shrines][[The New York Times]], 1988-05-29&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Sarabjit Singh, then [[Deputy Commissioner (India)|Deputy Commissioner]] of Amritsar at the time published a book "Operation Black Thunder: An Eyewitness Account of Terrorism in Punjab".  The account was criticised by [[Kanwar Pal Singh Gill]] who claimed that the operation was initially called "Operation Gill" before being renamed "Operation Black Thunder".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2002/jul/29onkar.htm Now, Gill slams author of Operation Black Thunder], [[Rediff.com]], 2002-07-29&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paṇḍaka''' is a [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] [[sexuality]] term which does not have precise English translation, but incorporates (or perhaps confuses) multiple concepts associated with [[Sexual maturity|immaturity]], [[voyeurism]], [[impotence]] and [[infertility]].  It has been studied under the auspices of [[Theravada]] [[Buddhist]] thought.

==Historic context==
In the [[Vinaya]] [[Pali Canon]], 4 gender types are defined: male, female, ''ubhatobyañjanaka'' and pandaka.  ''ubhatobyañjanaka'' refers to [[intersex]] or literally ''a person with the signs of both sexes/genders''.  (Historic references to [[hermaphroditism]] have been superseded by the understanding that true hermaphroditism has never been observed in humans.)  Paṇḍaka is a less clear cut case, all references have a central theme: some form of  deficiency in male sexual reproductive capacity or reproductive desire.  In traditional Hindu pre-scientific thought, all reproductive capacity (or burden) has been assigned to the sperm and [[lingam]] with no credit to the female or egg.

The Pali literature makes reference to five types of pandaka:&lt;ref&gt;Bunmi Methangkun. 1986 (2529). Khon Pen kathoey Dai Yaang-rai (How Can People be kathoeys?), Bangkok: Abhidhamma Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/issue1-feb-mar-96/jackson/references.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''asittakapandaka'' - A man who gains satisfaction from performing [[oral sex]] on another man and from [[Semen#Semen_ingestion|ingesting his semen]], and only becomes sexually aroused after ingesting another man's semen.
* ''ussuyapandaka'' - A voyeur, a man who gains sexual satisfaction from watching a man and a woman having sex, and only becomes sexually aroused after that.
* ''opakkamikapandaka'' - A [[Eunuch]] ''by-assault'', [[testicle]] that are annihilated by assault or violence.&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;http://www.nationmultimedia.com/opinion/Homophobic-law-has-NO-BASIS-in-Buddhism-30257329.html&lt;/ref&gt;（"still could attain ejaculation through some special effort or artifice".）
* ''pakkhapandaka'' - People who become sexually aroused in parallel with the phases of the moon.
* ''napumsakapandaka'' - A person with no clearly defined genitals, whether male or female, having only a urinary tract, one who is congenitally impotent.

==Modern context==
In the crackdowns on [[Crime in Thailand|crime]] in [[2014 Thai coup d'état|post-coup]] [[Thailand]], there is draft legislation to clean out crime and sociopaths from the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], and in this drive, a motion to criminalize ''sexual deviant behaviours'' within it, yet the very definitions of ''sexual deviancy'' or [[paraphilia]] are being challenged and revisited by scholars.&lt;ref name="nation"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3396">The '''Patharkat'''  are a [[Hindu]] sub-[[caste]] found in [[North India]]. The majority of this subcaste in Nepal, '''Kushbadiya''', speak a poorly known language, and exhibit enough distinct cultural values to be a separate ethnic group, nevertheless Pattharkat in [[Kapilbastu District]] are exceptional as they considered themselves to be [[Dalit]] rather than [[adivasi]].&lt;ref&gt;"'Socioeconomic Status and Access Barriers to Healthcare Services in Kushbadiya Community' (SIRF/HG RF/09/013) Final Report"&lt;/ref&gt; In India, they are also known as Sangtarash.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 1142 to 1146 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Patharkat are a sub-group of the larger [[Kanjar]] caste. Their name Patharkat in [[Hindi]] literally means stone cutters. Having taken up the profession of stone cutting, this particular group of [[Kanjar]]s broke all links with the parent community, and the two communities do not now intermarry. They are found mainly in [[Awadh]], and their concentrations are in the districts of [[Sitapur]], [[Unnao]], [[Raebareli]], [[Hardoi]] and [[Lucknow]]. In Lucknow, they are found mainly in the localities of [[Qaisar Bagh]], Saafatgang, Daligang, Bangla Bazar, Nishatgang, Lal Kuan and Chinhat. They speak [[Ghiarai]] among themselves and Hindi with outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;''People of India Uttar Pradesh'' Volume XLII Part Three edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das, page 1142–1146 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bihar]], the Patharkat are found in the districts of [[Champaran]], [[Arrah]] and [[Gaya, India|Gaya]]. They are divided into seven exogamous clans, the Sankat, Sanda, Bhains, Marriya, Uthwar, Lahia and Baid. The Patharkat claim to have comme from [[Rajasthan]] some three hundred years ago.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Bihar Volume XVI  Part Two edited by S Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha pages 770 to 771 Seagull Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==
The Patharkat are [[endogamous]], but avoid marrying among close, but they have no system of exogamous clans. They are largely a landless and urban community, and their traditional occupation remains the manufacturing of the [[Hindu]] idols. The Patharkat now buys stones from quarries in western [[Uttar Pradesh]], and then engrave and cut the stones. A few Patharkat have abandoned their traditional occupation and taken to wage labour. The Indian government has given them [[scheduled caste]] status, which allowed some to access affirmative action programmes. They are [[Hindu]], and their customs are similar to other [[Awadh]] [[Hindu]]s.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 1142 to 1146 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bihar]] Patharkat are a nomadic community, and many are employed in quaries. They move from place to place, and live in ecampments at the edges of towns. The Patharkat are strictly endogamous, and practice clan [[exogamy]]. They are almost totally illiterate, and are one of the most deprived community in [[Bihar]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Bihar Volume XVI  Part Two edited by S Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha pages 770 to 771 Seagull Books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pan pitys.jpg|thumb|''Pan and Pitys'', [[Edward Calvert (painter)|Edward Calvert]].]]
In [[Greek mythology]]— or more particularly in Ancient Greek poetry— '''Pitys''' (Πίτυς; English translation: "pine") was an [[Oread]] [[nymph]] who was pursued by [[Pan (god)|Pan]].  According to a passage in [[Nonnus]]' ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' (ii.108) she was changed into a pine tree by the gods in order to escape him. Pitys is mentioned in [[Longus]]' ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'' (ii.7 and 39) and by [[Lucian of Samosata]] (''Dialogues of the Dead'', 22.4).&lt;ref&gt;These occurrences are noted by Birger A. Pearson, "'She Became a Tree': A Note to CG II, 4: 89, 25-26" ''The Harvard Theological Review'', '''69'''.3/4 (July - October 1976): 413-415) p. 414 note 8; Pearson notes that an assertion by Rouse in notes to ''Dionysiaca'' ([[Loeb Classical Library]]), to the effect that Pitys is mentioned in [[Propertius]] is in error.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitys was chased by Pan as was [[Syrinx]], who was turned into reeds to escape the god who then used her reeds for his [[panpipes]]. The flute-notes may have frightened the [[maenads]] running from his woodland in a "panic." The subject is illustrated in paintings of (roughly chronologically) [[Nicolas Poussin]], [[Jacob Jordaens]], [[François Boucher]], [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Andrea Casali]], [[Arnold Bocklin]], Sir [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], and [[Maxfield Parrish]].

'''Pythion''' ({{lang-el|Πύθιον}}) or '''Pythium''', also '''Pythoion''' (Πύθοιον) was a city and [[polis]] (city-state)&lt;ref name=Poleis&gt;{{cite book|author= Mogens Herman Hansen &amp; Thomas Heine Nielsen |title= An inventory of archaic and classical poleis|year= 2004|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn= 0-19-814099-1|chapter= Thessaly and Adjacent Regions|pages= 726-727}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Perrhaebia]] in [[ancient Thessaly]], situated at the foot of [[Mount Olympus]], and forming a [[Tripolis (region of Thessaly)|Tripolis]] with the two neighbouring towns of [[Azorus]] and [[Doliche (Thessaly)|Doliche]]. Pythion derived its name from a temple of [[Apollo|Apollo Pythius]] situated on one of the summits of Olympus, as we learn from an epigram of [[Xeinagoras]], a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[mathematician]], who measured the height of Olympus from these parts.&lt;ref&gt;''ap.'' [[Plutarch|Plut.]] ''Aemil. Paul.'' 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Games were also celebrated here in honour of Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Stephanus|''s.v.'' Πύθιον}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pythion commanded an important pass across Mount Olympus. This pass and that of [[Vale of Tempe|Tempe]] are the only two leading from [[Macedon]]ia into the northeast of Thessaly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|42.53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Ptolemy|3.13.42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is occupied by a modern town of [[Pythio]], but virtually no remains of the ancient town have been discovered there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DGRG|title=Pythium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[Amyntas III]] or [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], the Tripolis  was annexed to Macedon. According to [[Theagenes (historian)|Theagenes]] the inhabitants of [[Balla (Pieria)|Balla]] were relocated to Pythion. So we find in 3rd century BC an epigram regarding Philarchos son of Hellanion, Macedonian [[Elimiotis|Elimiote]] from Pythion, [[proxenos]] in Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=240649&amp;bookid=452&amp;region=3&amp;subregion=7 FD III 4:417]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;City and sanctuary in ancient Greece: the Theorodokia in the Peloponnese By Paula Jean Perlman Page 127 {{ISBN|3-525-25218-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Roman–Seleucid War]], the Tripolis was ravaged by an army of [[Aetolians]] in the year 191&amp;nbsp;BCE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|36.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Third Macedonian War]] the three towns surrendered to the army of [[Perseus of Macedon]] in the year 171&amp;nbsp;BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|42.53}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that same year the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] reconquered the three.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|42.67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 169&amp;nbsp;BCE troops arrived from the Roman consul [[Quintus Marcius Philippus (consul 186 BC)|Quintus Marcius Philippus]] who camped between Azorus and Doliche.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Polybius|28.13.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|44.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|Reigning Emperor|今上天皇|Kinjō Tennō|lead=yes}} or {{nihongo|[[Majesty]]|陛下|Heika}}, according to protocol, is the honorific title used in [[Japan]] to refer to the current [[Emperor of Japan]] instead of using their [[personal name]] (e.g. [[Hirohito]]), as is done in [[Western culture|the West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Erskine|1933}}, quote: "In Japan, the personal name of the Emperor is never used by the people. He is always spoken of as the ''Heika'' or the ''Kinjo no Heika'' while living, and after his death is spoken of as the "Meiji Tenno" or " Taisho Tenno"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=izawa&gt;{{Harvnb|Izawa|2011\P=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only context where the personal name is used is when referring to their time before taking the throne (e.g. Prince Hirohito {{Nihongo2|裕仁親王}} ''Hirohito shinnō''). Members of the [[Imperial household]] have additional ''-miya'' type titles; the current Crown Prince is usually referred to by this title (e.g. [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Prince Hiro]] ({{Nihongo2|浩宮}} ''Hiro-no-miya'').

==History==
Under the modern system, the {{nihongo|[[posthumous name]]|諡号|shigō|extra=colloquially ''gō''}} of the emperor will always match the {{Nihongo|era name or [[regnal year]] name|元号|gengō}}. However, this  {{Nihongo|"one generation one title"|{{nowrap|[[:ja:一世一元|一世一元]]}}|issei ichigen}} system was only implemented in the modern age of the [[Meiji Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tanaka|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the emperor's name never matched the era name, and the {{Nihongo|change of the era name|[[:ja:改元|改元]]|kaigen}} could occur any number of times. Additionally, some emperors had two ''gō'' titles, when reoccupying the throne in a process called {{Nihongo||[[:ja:重祚|重祚]]|chōso}}. One example of this was [[Empress Kōgyoku]], who later mounted the throne as [[Empress Saimei]].

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5678">Changes in religious demography are often consequences, and often goals, of human mass migration to other territories. Often, the goals of a [[political migration]] is to establish a territory and governments biased towards and welcoming of members of the same sect.

==Examples==
===Aliyah to Israel===
{{main|Aliyah}}
After Austro-Hungarian journalist [[Theodor Herzl]] issued a call for Jewish settlement in the historic homeland of Israel (at the time known as Palestine), thousands and later millions would begin to migrate to the then-Ottoman-ruled territory and establish communal settlements known as [[kibbutz]]im. While the majority of early settlers who had migrated were secular socialists, a larger segment of later settlers from Europe after the turnover of the territory to British occupation would be more religiously observant and would be driven by increasingly violent and state-supported anti-Semitism. During and after World War II, Jewish migrants would flee to the territory en masse, despite British crackdowns on illegal immigration. Following independence in 1948, the state of Israel has had a policy of encouraging Jewish migration to the territory under the [[Law of Return]]. 

===Plymouth Colony===
{{main|Plymouth Colony}}
The Plymouth Colony was established in 1620 by a sect of the [[English Dissenters]] which had fled first to the [[Netherlands]] following persecution by the English monarchy before ultimately deciding to move to North America by boat. The migration, settlement and interaction with the Native peoples of Massachusetts would be celebrated in the present-day United States as [[Thanksgiving]] and a watershed moment for religious liberty in the continent. 

===Massachusetts Bay Colony===
{{main|Massachusetts Bay Colony}}
The Massachusetts Bay Colony was established eight years after the establishment of the Plymouth Colony by members of the Puritan movement. One leader of the movement, [[John Winthrop]], sought to establish a "city upon a hill" as an example for other colonies to follow, and Puritanism was enforced, at the expense of other religious movements, as the favored religion of the colony for the majority of its history until its merger with Plymouth and other nearby settlements in 1691 into the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]]. 

===Mormon migration to Utah===
{{main|Mormon pioneers|Mormon Trail}}
Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] were motivated to migrate from [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] to Utah due to both violent persecutions directed against the sect by Protestant citizens and government officials as well as a desire by [[Brigham Young]] to establish a Mormon majority territory that would be governed according to Mormon sensibilities and divine law. Tens of thousands of Mormons migrated to Utah and established settlements in the latter 19th century, eventually drawing the ire of the United States government for a time unyielding til the territory (also described colloquially by residents as "[[State of Deseret|Deseret]]") was integrated as the [[Territory of Utah]].

===Pakistan-India===
{{main|Partition of India}}
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:Oxcart-train1947.jpg|thumb|Rural Sikhs in a long ox-cart train heading towards India. [[Margaret Bourke-White]], 1947. The migration was a "massive exercise in human misery," wrote Bourke-White.]] --&gt;
In 1947, upon the [[Partition of India]], large populations moved from India to Pakistan and vice versa, depending on their religious beliefs. The partition was promulgated in the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] as a result of the dissolution of the [[British Indian Empire]]. The partition displaced up to 12.5 million people in the former British Indian Empire, with estimates of loss of life varying from several hundred thousand to a million.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf, Barbara; Metcalf, Thomas R. (2006), A Concise History of Modern India (Cambridge Concise Histories), Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press. Pp. xxxiii, 372, {{ISBN|0-521-68225-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Muslim]] residents of the former British India migrated to [[Pakistan]] (including East Pakistan which is now Bangladesh), whilst [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] residents of Pakistan and Hindu residents of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) moved in the opposite direction.

In modern India, estimates based on industry sectors mainly employing migrants suggest that there are around 100 million circular migrants in India. Caste, social networks and historical precedents play a powerful role in shaping patterns of migration. Migration for the poor is mainly circular, as despite moving temporarily to urban areas, they lack the social security which might keep them there more permanently. They are also keen to maintain a foothold in home areas during the agricultural season.

Research by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] identifies a rapid movement of labour from slower- to faster-growing parts of the economy. Migrants can often find themselves excluded by urban housing policies, and [[Migrant worker|migrant]] support initiatives are needed to give workers improved access to market information, certification of identity, [[House|housing]] and [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2466&amp;title=support-migrant-workers-missing-link-indias-development|title=Support for migrant workers: the missing link in India's development?|date=September 2008|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2940">'''Sagdukht''' ({{lang-ka|საგდუხტი}}) was a 5th-century [[List of Georgian consorts|queen consort]] of [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]], natively known as [[Kartli]] in eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], as wife of King [[Mihrdat V of Iberia|Mirdat V]]. She was a daughter of [[Barzabod]], a [[Mihranids|Mihranid]] ruler of [[Gardman]]. 

Sagdukht is primarily known from the Georgian chronicle, written by [[Juansheriani|Juansher]] c. 800, relating life of King [[Vakhtang I of Iberia|Vakhtang I]], the son of Mirdat and Sagdukht. She is also mentioned as Sahakdukht in the works of the 13th-century Armenian historian [[Vardan Areveltsi|Vardan]]. Modern historians such as [[Ivane Javakhishvili]], [[Simon Janashia]], and [[Cyril Toumanoff]] identify her with the Sahakdukht recorded in a Georgian inscription on an icon from the Jvarisa church in the village of [[Znakva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danelia|first1=Korneli|last2=Sarjveladze|first2=Zurab|title=ქართული პალეოგრაფია |trans-title=Georgian Paleography|year=1997|location=Tbilisi|page = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toumanoff|first=Cyril|title=Studies in Christian Caucasian history|year=1963|publisher=Georgetown University Press|location=Washington, DC | page = 400, n. 186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Juansher's chronicle, Sagdukht's hand was sought and obtained by Mirdat—then heir apparent to his reigning father [[Archil of Iberia|King Archil]]—who was captivated by Sagdukht's beauty and also sought to ensure the peace between Iberia and Gardman, the Rani ([[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]]) of the Georgian source. The couple settled at Mirdat's appanage of [[Samshvilde]], where Sagdukht converted to Christianity and built the church of Sioni. Sagdukht gave birth to two daughters, Khvarandze and Mirandukht, and one son, Vakhtang. After Mirdat's death, Sagdukht assumed regency for her underage son under the protection of her father. Later, according to Juansher, Sagdukht and Khvarandze were temporarily left in government of Kartli during Vakhtang's absence on a military expedition against the [[Alans]] in the [[Caucasus Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gamq’relidze|first1=Dmitri|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Stephen|title=Kartlis Tskhovreba.

'''Sahaja''' ({{lang-sa|{{IAST|sahaja}}}}), means innate. The equivalent term in Tibetan is ''lhan cig tu skye ba''&lt;ref&gt;[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/lhan_cig_skyes_pa]&lt;/ref&gt;. It is a term of some importance in Indian and Tibetan Buddhist spirituality. Sahaja practices first arose in [[Bengal]] during the 8th century among Buddhist [[yogis]] called Sahajiya [[siddhas]]. 

[[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] describes its significance as "the last achievement of all thought", and "a recognition of the identity of spirit and matter, subject and object", continuing "There is then no sacred or profane, spiritual or sensual, but everything that lives is pure and void."&lt;ref&gt;Coomaraswamy, Ananda Kentish (1985).

== Etymology ==
The Sanskrit [and the Tibetan, which precisely follows it] literally means: 'born or produced together or at the same time as. Congenital, innate, hereditary, original, natural (...by birth, by nature, naturally...)'.&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams Sanskrit Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

Etymologically, ''saḥ-'' means 'together with', and ''ja'' derives from the root ''jan'', meaning 'to be born, produced, to occur, to happen'.&lt;ref&gt;Dhātu-pāṭha&lt;/ref&gt;. The Tibetan ''lhan cig tu skye ba'' is an exact etymological equivalent of the Sanskrit. ''Lhan cig'' means 'together with', and ''skye ba'' means 'to be born, to arise, to come about, to be produced'.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Duff's Illuminator Tibetan Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/lhan_cig_skyes_pa&lt;/ref&gt; The Tibetan can function as verbal phrase, noun, or adjective.

== Origins and Buddhist Sahajayana ==
[[File:Sketch Kanhapad.jpg|thumb|A sketch of Siddhacharya poet Kanhapada]]
The Buddhist [[siddha]] [[Saraha]] (8th century CE) was the founder of the Buddhist movement termed "Sahajayana" which flourished in [[Odisha]] &lt;ref&gt;Ramprasad Mishra, Sahajayana (A Study of Tantric Buddhism), preface&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bengal]]. Sahajiya [[mahasiddha]]s like Saraha, [[Kanha (poet)|Kanha]], Savari and [[Luipa]] were [[Vajrayana|tantric]] Buddhists who expounded their beliefs in songs and [[Doha (poetry)|dohas]] in the [[Apabhraṃśa]] languages &lt;ref name="Das Gupta"&gt;Shashibhusan Das Gupta, ''Obscure religious cults'' (Calcutta: Mukhopadhyay, 1969), chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kvaerne"&gt;Per Kvaerne, On the Concept of Sahaja in Indian Buddhist Tantric Literature, ''Temenos'', vol.11, 1975, pp88-135&lt;/ref&gt; and Bengali. Many of the songs in this tradition are preserved in the [[Charyapada]].

Sahajiyas such as Saraha believed that enlightenment could be achieved in this lifetime, by laypersons living in [[samsara]]. Though he was a famed Buddhist sage,.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Conway, Saraha: One of the earliest, wisest Buddhist Tantra mahasiddha-sages, 2012, http://www.enlightened-spirituality.org/Saraha.html&lt;/ref&gt; The sahajiyas practiced a form of ritual union which was supposed to bring the female and male elements together in balance.&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel, J. The Madness of the Saints: Ecstatic Religion in Bengal, 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saraha and his disciples were also master practitioners of [[Mahamudra]] meditation, and Saraha composed a famous Mahamudra meditation text along with his 'Three Cycles of Doha', a series of yogic songs.&lt;ref&gt;Biographies: The Great Yogi Saraha, ''Dharma Fellowship'' http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/historicalsaints/saraha.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Sahajiyas also criticized the Hindu caste system. Sahajayana Buddhism became very popular in the [[Pala Empire]], especially among commoners.&lt;ref&gt;Jhunu Bagchi, The History and Culture of the Pālas of Bengal and Bihar, page 101&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the classic texts associated with the Sahajiya Buddhists is the [[Hevajra]] Tantra. The tantra describes four kinds of Joy (ecstasy):

''From Joy there is some bliss, from Perfect Joy yet more. From the Joy of Cessation comes a passionless state. The Joy of Sahaja is finality. The first comes by desire for contact, the second by desire for bliss, the third from the passing of passion, and by this means the fourth [Sahaja] is realized. Perfect Joy is samsara [mystic union]. The Joy of Cessation is nirvana. Then there is a plain Joy between the two. Sahaja is free of them all. For there is neither desire nor absence of desire, nor a middle to be obtained.''&lt;ref&gt;
John Noyce, Origins of Sahaja&lt;/ref&gt;

The siddhi, Indrabhuti, wrote a commentary on Sahaja teachings called the ''Sahajasiddhipaddhati.''

== In the Nāth tradition ==
{{main|Nath}}

''Sahaja''  is one of the four keywords of the [[Nath]] [[sampradaya]] along with [[Svecchachara]], [[Samaveda|Sama]], and [[Samarasa]]. ''Sahaja'' meditation and worship was prevalent in Tantric traditions common to [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] in Bengal as early as the 8th–9th centuries. The British Nath teacher Mahendranath wrote:

{{quote|Man is born with an instinct for naturalness. He has never forgotten the days of his primordial perfection, except insomuch as the memory became buried under the artificial superstructure of civilization and its artificial concepts. ''Sahaja'' means natural... The tree grows according to ''Sahaja'', natural and spontaneous in complete conformity with the Natural Law of the Universe. Nobody tells it what to do or how to grow. It has no ''swadharma'' or rules, duties and obligations incurred by birth. It has only ''[[svabhava]]'' - its own inborn self or essence - to guide it. ''Sahaja'' is that nature which, when established in oneself, brings the state of absolute freedom and peace.&lt;ref&gt;Shri Gurudev Mahendranath, ''The Pathless Path to Immortality''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept of a spontaneous spirituality entered [[Hinduism]] with [[Nath]] yogis such as [[Gorakshanath]] and was often alluded to indirectly and symbolically in the [[twilight language]] (''sandhya bhasa'') common to sahaja traditions as found in the ''[[Charyapada]]'' and works by [[Matsyendranath]] and [[Daripada]].&lt;ref&gt;Nayak, Pabitra Mohan Nayak (2006).

[[Yoga]] in particular had a quickening influence on the various Sahajiya traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shashibhusan Dasgupta]] (1946, 1969 third edition, 1976 reprint). ''Obscure Religious Cults''. Firma KLM Private Limited: Calcutta, India. Sarasvati Printing Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The culture of the body (''kāya-sādhana'') through processes of Haṭha-yoga was of paramount importance in the Nāth sect and found in all sahaja schools. Whether conceived of as 'supreme bliss' (Mahā-sukha), as by the Buddhist Sahajiyās, or as 'supreme love' (as with the Vaiṣṇava Sahajiyās), strength of the body was deemed necessary to stand such a supreme realisation.&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, Shashibhusan (1946, 1969 third edition, 1976 reprint). ''Obscure Religious Cults''. Firma KLM Private Limited: Calcutta, India. Sarasvati Printing Press, p.xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vaishnava-Sahajiya ==
{{main|Vaishnava-Sahajiya}}

The ''Vaishnava-Sahajiya'' sect became popular in 17th century Bengal. It sought religious experience through the [[sense|five senses]]. The divine relationship between Krishna and Radha (guises of the divine masculine and divine feminine) had been celebrated by [[Chandidas]] (Bangla: চন্ডীদাস) (born 1408 CE), [[Jayadeva]]  (circa 1200 CE) and [[Vidyapati]] (c 1352 - c 1448) whose works foreshadowed the ''[[Rasa (theology)|rasas]]'' or "flavours" of love. The two aspects of absolute reality were explained as the eternal enjoyer and the enjoyed, Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā conceived of as ontological principles of which all men and women are physical manifestations, as may be realised through a process of attribution (''Aropa''), in which the sexual intercourse of a human couple is transmuted into the divine love between Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā, leading to the highest spiritual realisation, the state of union or ''Yugala''. The element of love, the innovation of the Vaiṣṇava Sahajiyā school, is essentially based on the element of yoga in the form of physical and psychological discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, Shashibhusan (1946, 1969 third edition, 1976 reprint). ''Obscure Religious Cults''. Firma KLM Private Limited: Calcutta, India. Sarasvati Printing Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaisnava-Sahajiya is a synthesis and complex of traditions that, due to its sexual tantric practices, was perceived with disdain by other religious communities and much of the time was forced to operate in secrecy. Its literature employed an encrypted and enigmatic style. Because of the necessity of privacy and secrecy, little is definitively known about their prevalence or practices.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9074642/Vaisnava-Sahajiya] (accessed:  Monday July 9, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sahaja-siddhi ==
The ''sahaja-siddhi'' or the ''[[siddhi]]'' or "natural accomplishment" or the "accomplishment of the unconditioned natural state" was also a textual work, the ''Sahaja-Siddhi'' revealed by Dombi Heruka (Skt. Ḍombi Heruka or Ḍombipa)&lt;ref&gt;Rigpa Shedra (2009). 'Dombi Heruka'. Source: [http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Dombi_Heruka] (accessed: November 6, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; one of the eighty-four [[Mahasiddha]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Chattopadhyana, Debiprasad (ed.)(1970). ''Taranatha's History of Buddhism in India''. Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Simla. p.245-246&lt;/ref&gt; The following quotation identifies the relationship of the 'mental flux' ([[mindstream]]) to the sahaja-siddhi. Moreover, it must be remembered that though Sundararajan &amp; Mukerji (2003: p.&amp;nbsp;502) use a masculine pronominal the term 'siddha' is not gender-specific and that there were females, many as senior sadhakas, amongst the siddha communities:

{{quote|The practitioner is now a ''siddha'', a realized soul. He becomes invulnerable, beyond all dangers, when all forms melt away into the Formless, "when ''surati'' merges in ''nirati'', ''japa'' is lost in ''ajapā''" (''Sākhī'', "Parcā ko Aṅga," d.23). The meeting of ''surati'' and ''nirati'' is one of the signs of ''sahaja-siddhi''; ''surati'' is an act of will even when the practitioner struggles to disengage himself from worldly attachments. But when his worldliness is totally destroyed with the dissolution of the ego, there is ''nirati'', cessation of the mental flux, which implies cessation of all willed efforts. ''Nirati'' (''ni-rati'') is also cessation of attractions, since the object of attraction and the seeker are now one. In terms of ''layayoga'', ''nirati'' is dissolution of the mind in &lt;nowiki&gt;"&lt;/nowiki&gt;Sound,&lt;nowiki&gt;"&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''nāda''.&lt;ref&gt;Sundararajan, K. R.; Mukerji, Bithika (2003).

'''Sayyid Jani Shah''', also called Baba Jaani Shah,  was a [[Muslim]] [[Pir (Sufism)|Pir]] who accepted the [[Sikh]] faith after having religious discourses with [[Guru Har Gobind]]. According to Sri Gurpartap Suraj Granth he was from lineage of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010624/spectrum/main1.htm SRI HARGOBINDPUR, THE GURU'S SECULAR CITY,  Anna Barry Bigelow]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Selvarajan Yesudian arrived in Hungary from India in 1937 and founded Europe's first yoga school in Budapest with Elisabeth Haich (in Hungarian: Haich Erzsébet) in 1941. After World War II in 1948 they had to close their school, when the communist regime came to power in the Soviet occupied country, and fled to Switzerland. They settled and founded their new yoga school there, which became well known and had an international reputation in the following decades.

'''''Signals of Belief in Early England: Anglo-Saxon Paganism Revisited''''' is an academic anthology edited by the British archaeologists [[Martin Carver]], Alex Sanmark and Sarah Semple which was first published by Oxbow Books in 2010. Containing nine separate papers produced by various scholars working in the fields of [[Anglo-Saxon archaeology]] and [[Anglo-Saxon history]], the book presents a number of new perspectives on [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]] and, to a lesser extent, early [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity]]. The collection &amp;ndash; published in honour of the archaeologist [[Audrey Meaney]] &amp;ndash; was put together on the basis of a conference on "Paganism and Popular Practice" held at the [[University of Oxford]] in 2005.

Opening with a foreword by [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]], the book's first paper, written by Carver, examines how archaeologists can best understand Anglo-Saxon paganism, drawing from the works of Price and [[David Lewis-Williams]] in order to do so. The second, written by Semple, looks at how pagan Anglo-Saxons viewed their surrounding landscape, whilst the third, written by Julie Lund, delves into Anglo-Saxon votive depositions into water. The fourth paper, authored by [[Howard Williams (archaeologist)|Howard Williams]], looks at funerary practices, which is followed by Jenny Walker's study on the religious aspects of the hall.

The sixth paper, produced by [[Aleks Pluskowski]], delves into the roles of animals in Anglo-Saxon belief, while Chris Fern's following paper focuses on the role of the horse. The eighth paper, written by Sanmark, looks at conceptions of ancestors and the soul, while the ninth, co-authored by Sue Content and Howard Williams, looks at the subsequent understandings of Anglo-Saxon pagandom. In the afterword, written by historian [[Ronald Hutton]], the findings of the book are summarised and potential areas of future research highlighted.

The book received a mixed review in Charlotte Behr's review for the journal ''[[Anglo-Saxon England (journal)|Anglo-Saxon England]]'', and a positive one from Chris Scull in the ''British Archaeology'' magazine. It was praised by others looking at the field of Anglo-Saxon paganism, such as [[Stephen Pollington]].

==Background==

The origins for ''Signals of Belief in Early England'' came from a conference held in 2005 at the [[University of Oxford]]; based around the subject of "Paganism and Popular Practice", it had been organised by Sarah Semple and Alex Sanmark, two archaeologists who would go on to edit the volume. The decision to produce a book based on the papers presented at that conference gained a "renewed impetus" after two further academic conferences were held by the [[Sutton Hoo Society]], on the subjects of paganism and Anglo-Saxon halls respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010]]. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection was published in honour of the archaeologist [[Audrey Meaney]], "in appreciation of her studies of Anglo-Saxon paganism."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010]]. p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreword, archaeologist Neil Price commented on Meaney and her influential work, noting that most of the published studies that had previously delved into the world of Anglo-Saxon paganism came from her "monumental output", and that it was her "years spent patiently excavating Anglo-Saxon attitudes this collection honours."&lt;ref name="Price xiv"/&gt;

Previous understandings of the topic, well rooted in the ideas of its time, regarded the English as adherents of two consecutive religions: Paganism governed the settlers of the 4th&amp;ndash;6th century, but was superseded in the 7th&amp;ndash;10th century by Christianity. Of the two, Christianity, a religion of the book, documented itself thoroughly, while in failing to do so Paganism laid itself open to centuries of abuse, conjecture or mindless admiration."

In the book's preface, written by Martin Carver, Alex Sanmark and Sarah Semple, the anthology's three objectives are laid out. The first of these is to establish that Anglo-Saxon paganism consisted of "a set of beliefs that varied from place to place" rather than being a dogmatic religion that was the same across England. The second objective is to show that the beliefs of the pagan Anglo-Saxons, "whether pure reason or intellectual mish-mash, [were] expressed in their material culture". Carrying on from the second, the third objective of the anthology was to show that through [[archaeology]], contemporary scholars can "rediscover" Anglo-Saxon belief.&lt;ref name="Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010 ix"/&gt;

Summing up their view of Anglo-Saxon paganism, the editors state that it "was not a religion with supraregional rules and institutions but a loose term for a variety of local intellectual world views".&lt;ref name="Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010 ix"/&gt; They also "extend the same courtesy to Christianity", noting that "Christianisation too hides a multiplicity of locally negotiated positions".&lt;ref name="Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010 ix"/&gt; Ultimately, the writers noted that neither "paganism nor Christianity are treated here as independent agents, out to confront and better each other. They are sources on which people, local people &amp;ndash; the true agents of Anglo-Saxon England &amp;ndash; eclectically drew.&lt;ref name="Carver, Sanmark and Semple 2010 ix"/&gt;

===Price's "Foreword: Heathen Songs and Devil's Games"===

The book's foreword, entitled "Heathen Songs and Devil's Games", was written by the archaeologist [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]], then a professor at the [[University of Aberdeen]]. Price had previously been involved in the investigation of the pre-Christian religious beliefs of northern Europe, authoring the influential book, ''[[The Viking Way (book)|The Viking Way: Religion and War in the Later Iron Age of Scandinavia]]'' (2002). In his foreword, Price comments positively on ''Signals of Belief in Early England'' as a whole, noting that it is "remarkable that the present book represents the first attempt for nearly two decades to present an overall survey of early English beliefs that cannot be firmly situated within a Christian frame."&lt;ref name="Price xiv"&gt;[[#Pric10|Price 2010]]. p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Price writes, ''Signals of Belief in Early England'' "simply represents the state of the art, with supporting references to the work on which it builds, and summarises with admirable caution and sensitivity most of what we currently know about the intricate mental world of the pre-Christian English. All future journeys through this difficult terrain must necessarily start here, and they could not have a better guide."&lt;ref name="Price xvi"&gt;[[#Pric10|Price 2010]]. p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carver's "Agency, Intellect and the Archaeological Agenda"===
In the first paper of the anthology, written by Martin Carver of the [[University of York]], the author opens with a discussion of the work of Neil Price in his book ''The Viking Way'' (2002), which explored the existence of female shamans in pre-Christian Scandinavian society.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt; He proceeds to note that the work of Price and other academics has enabled contemporary scholars to understand historical paganism far better than ever before because they are "better equipped in that triad of disciplines"; archaeology, anthropology and history.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 3&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt; Carver then goes on to discuss the work of the archaeologist [[David Lewis-Williams]] in his book ''[[The Mind in the Cave]]'' (2002), which Carver argued has "redefined the world of early spirituality for archaeologists". Carver expresses his opinion that both Lewis-Williams' theories and his multidisciplinary approach (using methods drawn from disciplines like anthropology, psychology, art and ethnology) can be employed in order to shed light on the world of Anglo-Saxon paganism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He proceeds to point out several problems facing archaeologists in their study of Anglo-Saxon paganism,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; before looking at the ideas put forward by the archaeologists [[Colin Renfrew]] and [[Tim Insoll]] for how to best understand the cognitive aspects of historical religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 6&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

Setting up a "programme for investigating Anglo-Saxon spirituality", Carver argues that those Anglo-Saxonist archaeologists who have focused their research on either the pagan or the Christian periods of Anglo-Saxon history need to interact with one another far more, before stating that the same is true for prehistorians and medievalists; in Carver's opinion, an understanding of the beliefs of the Early Anglo-Saxon period can only be achieved by understanding it as being, in part, a "continuum of prehistory".&lt;ref name="Carver 8"/&gt; Moving on to discuss the burial monuments of Anglo-Saxon England and their relations with those found elsewhere in north-western Europe, Carver argues that we can understand more about the beliefs of people at the time by looking at the spread of specific burial styles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 8&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt; He then looks at the assembly sites found in Anglo-Saxon England, arguing that there is sufficient archaeological evidence for specific shrine structures, here drawing parallels with the work of archaeologist [[Leszek Słupecki]] in relation to the pagan shrines of Slavic Europe. Going on to reference several excavations in northern Europe, Carver discusses the theory that halls were also used as ritual spaces, and considers whether the same could be true of Anglo-Saxon England.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 11&amp;ndash;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third part of his paper, Carver deals with what he describes as "Christian variants", arguing that in his view, the archaeological evidence implies that "paganism and Christianity do not, in this period, describe homogenous intellectual positions or canons of practice. Pagan ideas and material vocabulary were drawn from a wide reservoir of cosmology and were recomposed as local statements with their own geographical and chronological context. I believe that the same kind of evidence, the evidence of monumentality, provokes us to a similar judgment of Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. pp. 14&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Carver argues, most individuals in 7th-century England were neither clearly Christian or pagan, but adhered to elements of both in a syncretic fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car10|Carver 2010]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semple's "In the Open Air"===
In the second paper of the anthology, entitled "In the Open Air", Sarah Semple provides an overview of what she refers to as the "pre-Christian sacred landscape". Opening the article, Semple discusses the theoretical trends behind recent Anglo-Saxon scholarship and looks at how these can enlighten our understanding of the Anglo-Saxon landscape; in doing so she argues in favour of an interdisciplinary approach which uses historical sources to back up archaeology, before then arguing for the use of continental European parallels to shed light on the world of Early Mediaeval England. Finally she argues that the landscape archaeology of Anglo-Saxon England has to be seen as an extension of the earlier prehistoric and Romano-British landscape rather than in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sem10|Semple 2010]]. pp. 21&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially describing "natural places" in the landscape, Semple discusses how the pagan Anglo-Saxons may have understood their surroundings, looking at the manner in which fields and groves were devoted to deities. Proceeding to look at the way in which pre-Christian Anglo-Saxons viewed hilltops, she discusses their association with sites designated as ''[[hearg]]'' in Old English. Semple then looks at the role of fissures, hollows and pits, highlighting how Anglo-Saxons believed them to be inhabited by monsters and goblins, before examining similar ideas regarding water-places, which were believed to be inhabited by ''[[nicor]]'' and which also saw some votive depositions occurring in the Early Mediaeval. Discussing [[votive offerings]] to such water-places, she then discusses the Anglo-Saxon attitude towards "ancient remains, monuments and ruins", discussing the re-use of prehistoric burial mounds and Roman-period structures. Rounding off her paper, Semple discusses evidence for pagan temples and shrines in the Anglo-Saxon landscape, as well as sacred beams, poles and totems.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sem10|Semple 2010]]. pp. 24&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lund's "At the Water's Edge"===
The anthology's third paper was produced by Julie Lund, then a Senior Lecturer in archaeology at the [[University of Oslo]] in Norway.  Entitled "At the Water's Edge", it looked at the relationship between the pre-Christian Anglo-Saxons and watery areas such as rivers and lakes, relying particularly on comparisons from Scandinavia. Opening with a discussion of those [[votive offerings]] that had been deposited into water, it goes on to discuss the Early Mediaeval idea that objects, and in particular swords, had personalities, and how this might be related to their ritual deposition. Proceeding to discuss the role of rivers in the Anglo-Saxon cognitive landscape, it examines the archaeological evidence for votive deposits placed into them at this time, noting the wide array of weapons, but also jewellery and tools, which have been found.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lun10|Lund 2010]]. pp. 49&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lund moves on to discuss the role of bridges, fords and crossings in both Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon contexts, arguing that they were significant sites in the latter's cognitive landscape, and that they were often used as the sites for votive offerings. She then discusses the role of lakes, noting that while there is ample evidence for votive deposition in Scandinavian lakes, there is currently none from Anglo-Saxon England. Finally, she looks at Christian attempts to suppress pagan ritual activity at watery places, and the revival which it experienced following the Scandinavian settlement of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lun10|Lund 2010]]. pp. 54&amp;ndash;66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Williams' "At the Funeral"===
The fourth paper in ''Signals of Belief'' was authored by Howard Williams, then a Professor of Archaeology at the [[University of Chester]]. Devoted to evaluating the evidence for pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon burial rites, it begins by explaining the approaches taken to this subject by earlier antiquarians and archaeologists. Moving on, Williams discusses the idea that mortuary practices in the Early Medieval Germanic-speaking world reflected pagan cosmology, eschatology, cosmogony and mythology, and describes those Scandinavian examples where aspects of the burial rituals have been interpreted as being symbolically related to elements of [[Norse mythology]]. Williams then discusses the role of cremation as a burial rite in Anglo-Saxon England, arguing that the whole cremation process must be viewed as a series of ritualised events rather than as a singular occurrence. Proceeding to discuss inhumation burials, Williams once more argues that there would have been a series of different ritualised scenes as the corpse was prepared, laid in the grave, and then covered in soil, rather than simply one singular layout of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil10|Williams 2010]]. pp. 67&amp;ndash;82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walker's "In the Hall"===
[[File:West Stow Hall 1.jpg|thumb|right|A reconstructed Anglo-Saxon Hall; Walker devoted her paper to discussing the ritual uses of such buildings.]]
The fifth paper of the anthology, authored by Jenny Walker, a graduate of the [[University of York]]'s Department of Archaeology, explores the role that the great wooden halls served as "ritual theatre[s]" in Anglo-Saxon paganism, using the Northumbrian site of [[Yeavering]] as a case study. Commenting on earlier approaches to understanding the relationship between religious practices and the Early Medieval hall both in England and Scandinavia, she highlights the influence of [[post-processual archaeology]] in altering earlier [[Culture-historical archaeology|culture-historical]] perspectives on this subject. Referencing the theories of sociologist [[Anthony Giddens]], Walker maintains that the role of both [[human agency]] and [[ideology]] in constructing the halls "as a political act" must be taken into account by archaeologists adopting a post-processual approach.

Proceeding to discuss the evidence for three of the halls excavated at Yeavering by archaeologist Brian Hope-Taylor in the early 20th century &amp;ndash; buildings A2, D2b and Bab &amp;ndash; she then goes on to discuss the archaeological evidence for two Scandinavian examples, [[Uppåkra]] in Skana, Sweden, and Borg at [[Vestvågøy]], Norway, both of which show evidence for ritual activity. Concluding her paper, Walker emphasises the diversity in uses that halls in Anglo-Saxon England &amp;ndash; and wider Northwestern Europe &amp;ndash; had been put in the Early Medieval. Some, she asserts, would have been used for both socio-political and socio-religious activities, while others would have been explicitly reserved for just one of these activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wal10|Walker 2010]]. pp. 83&amp;ndash;102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluskowski's "Animal Magic"===
Aleks Pluskowski &amp;ndash; an Archaeology Lecturer at the [[University of Reading]] &amp;ndash; offers the anthology's six paper, an exploration of the role that non-human animals played in pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon religion. Opening with a discussion of the "zoomorphic" symbolism of [[Anglo-Saxon art|Early Anglo-Saxon art]], he also lists the various different species, both wild and domestic, that the people of Anglo-Saxon England would have been familiar with from their daily lives. Pluskowski then moves on to look at the zoomorphic symbolism found on shields, themselves symbols of adult masculinity in Anglo-Saxon England, before providing a discussion of the idea that animals offered "windows to cosmology", representing symbols of different mythological figures and cosmological places that contemporary scholarship is unaware of, in doing so referencing the work of Stephen Glosecki. Proceeding to examine the symbolic use of animals in Anglo-Saxon warfare, he rounds off this chapter by dealing with both comparisons from continental Europe and Scandinavia and by looking at the influence that Christianity had on re-deploying the symbolism of zoomorphic designs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plu10|Plusckowski 2010]]. pp. 103&amp;ndash;127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fern's "Horses in Mind"===
In his paper, Chris Fern, an independent archaeologist and Research Associate of the [[University of York]], explored the role of the horse in Anglo-Saxon paganism. Remarking that the horse was "a motif with socio-political, heroic and spiritual significance" for the early Anglo-Saxons, he begins with a brief overview of the importance of horses in the preceding prehistoric and Roman periods of British history. Moving on to explore the ceremonial usages of horses in Anglo-Saxon England, he first examines the archaeological evidence for horses who had been cremated or placed in inhumation burials, including those from sites such as the [[Snape ship burial]] who had been ritually beheaded. Fern follows this with an examination of horses depicted in Anglo-Saxon art, noting the predominance of motifs featuring either two fighting stallions or a warrior riding a horse, the latter being an image which Fern argues had been adopted from Imperial Rome. He also puts forward the theory that the geometric stamps found imprinted on pots represented horse branding marks.

Proceeding to look at horses featured in documents from the period, Fern discusses the mythological figures [[Hengist and Horsa]] who appear in [[Bede]]'s 8th-century ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', as well as the role that the former played in the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]''. Turning his attention to the human consumption of [[Horse meat|horse flesh]] in this period, he argues that it was only eaten rarely, usually as "a sacred activity".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fer10|Fern 2010]]. pp. 128&amp;ndash;157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanmark's "Living On"===
The penultimate paper in the anthology, "Living On: Ancestors and the Soul", is authored by Alexandra Sanmark, then a post doctoral Research Associate at the Millennium Institute Centre for Nordic Studies and Lecturer at the [[University of Western Australia]]'s Department of History. In it, she takes a primarily historical approach to studying Anglo-Saxon conceptions of the soul, utilising comparisons from [[Norse paganism]], which she recognises offers contemporary scholars "an echo or an analogy" of Anglo-Saxon paganism. Beginning by discussing the structure of Norse religious thinking, she describes the division between the "higher religion" devoted to the cult of the gods and the "lower religion" devoted to the veneration of [[animism|animistic]] deities; Sanmark includes the Norse "cult of the ancestors" within this latter category. Expanding on this by exploring the Norse conception of the soul and the manner it which it might migrate in an animal form, she then turns her attention to similar evidence from Anglo-Saxon England, in particular discussing the ideas regarding an Anglo-Saxon shamanic tradition advocated by Stephen Glosecki.

At first dealing with the literary evidence from Anglo-Saxon poems like ''[[The Seafarer (poem)|The Seafarer]]'', she then turns her attention to the evidence from Anglo-Saxon art, again citing the theories of Glosecki. Looking at the link between an ancestor cult and places of burial &amp;ndash; namely [[burial mounds]], which she considers to be places of communication between the living and the dead &amp;ndash; she makes use of Norse historical texts and ethnographic evidence from Eastern Europe to argue that the Anglo-Saxons probably used burial mounds for the same purposes. Moving on to look at the relation between the ancestors and the ritual consumption of alcoholic beverages, she primarily makes use of Norse sources, before discussing the role of the malevolent ancestors in the pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon worldview, highlighting the [[Anglo-Saxon Deviant Burial Customs|theories regarding deviant burials]] advocated by archaeologist [[Andrew Reynolds (archaeologist)|Andrew Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#San10|Sanmark 2010]]. pp. 158&amp;ndash;180.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content and Williams' "Creating the Pagan English"===
The final paper of the anthology, "Creating the Pagan English: From the Tudors to the Present Day", is the product of a collaboration between Howard Williams and Sue Content, a doctoral student at the [[University of Chester]]'s Department of History and Archaeology. An overview of the history of Anglo-Saxon archaeological investigation into pre-Christian religion, it begins by looking at the manner in which the Anglo-Saxon pagans were glorified as proto-Protestants under the regime of the Tudor monarchs by the likes of [[Polydire Vergil]] and [[William Camden]], before highlighting how Roman Catholic writers such as [[Richard Verstegen]] counteracted this by portraying these pagans as barbaric. Chronologically proceeding to the 18th century, he discusses the ''Nenia Brittanica'', a proto-archaeological work authored by the Reverend James Douglas which discussed the material evidence for early Anglo-Saxon belief. Moving into the Victorian era, Content and Williams note that the period between ''circa'' 1845 and 1860 was important for the antiquarian investigation of Anglo-Saxon paganism, in particular making reference to the work of [[John Young Akerman]] and [[John Mitchell Kemble]]. They argue that following the deaths of these two figures, there was a period of stagnation in Anglo-Saxon archaeology lasting until 1910, when interest in the subject once more emerged.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Con10|Content and Williams 2010]]. pp. 181&amp;ndash;200.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The book's afterword, entitled "''Caveats'' and Futures", was written by the English historian [[Ronald Hutton]] (1953&amp;ndash;), then working at the [[University of Bristol]]. At the time a Commissioner for [[English Heritage]], Hutton had previously written about Anglo-Saxon paganism in a chapter of his book ''[[The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles|The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton notes that the collection exposes Anglo-Saxon England as a "world of fluid religious identities" in which people "pick and mix between religious systems", developing "their own idiomatic and personal manifestations" of belief and practice.&lt;ref name="Hutton 2010 201"/&gt;

==Reception and recognition==

===Academic and popular reviews===
In a review published in the academic journal ''[[Anglo-Saxon England (journal)|Anglo-Saxon England]]'', Charlotte Behr of [[Roehampton University]] noted that ''Signals of Belief in Early England'' differed from many conference volumes in that the archaeologists who authored the book's papers appear to have undertaken "intense discussions" about how to carry out their research and interpret the evidence. Although she believed that there was much to commend in the anthology, she was wary that words like "superstitious", "magical", "numinous", "sacred", "sanctified" and "supernatural" had been used in a loose way as if they were synonyms despite the fact that they have distinct meanings. She was also critical of "two dozen spelling errors" and "minor factual mistakes" that made it into the text, but ultimately considered the presentation of the book to be "pleasing".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beh11|Behr 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert J. Wallis reviewed the book for ''[[Time and Mind|Time and Mind: The Journal of Archaeology, Consciousness and Culture]]'', noting that it would be enjoyed by those who liked the theoretical positions adopted in the 1990s, and that much of the language used is similar to that which has been employed in Bronze and Iron Age Studies. Expressing that its [[post-processualism|post-processualist]] angle has given Anglo-Saxon archaeology "a sharper edge", he opines that it constitutes essential reading for those interested in this area, but that a greater attention to anthropological theory, particularly regarding concepts of animism, shamanism, and totemism, needs to be developed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wal12|Wallis 2012]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the [[Council for British Archaeology]]'s bimestrial magazine, ''British Archaeology'', the Early Medievalist Chris Scull praised ''Signals of Belief in Early England'', opining that it should be "required reading" for any researcher investigating Anglo-Saxon beliefs. Arguing that the book was "[s]timulating and provocative", he believed that the most successful essays were those that engaged directly with the "material evidence and near-contemporary texts" rather than those which used later Scandinavian sources. Scull furthermore expressed his view that archaeologists should now discard the terms "pagan" and "paganism" when "considering the belief-worlds of early England."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scu11|Scull 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
In the year following the publication of ''Signals of Belief in Early England'', the established Anglo-Saxonist [[Stephen Pollington]] published an overview of Anglo-Saxon paganism entitled ''The Elder Gods: The Otherworld of Early England''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pol11|Pollington 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''THC Ministry''', founded by [[Roger Christie]] from the Religion of Jesus Church, is a [[religion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thc-ministry.org/hawaiipolicerulesreligioususe.html |title=Hawaii Police Department (HPD) Religious Use Rules |publisher=Thc-ministry.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which considers [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to be a [[sacrament]]. Members base their practices on what they see as an eclectic mixture of ancient [[wisdom]], modern [[science]], and the enlightening and [[healing]] properties of cannabis [[sacrament]]. Its [[Strategic planning|mission]] includes "liberating the ''[[Cannabis]]'' plant and the minds of those who do and of those who do not revere it," and is actively involved in the legal and social discussions  surrounding cannabis use in society. On July 8, 2010, Christie and 13 other individuals allegedly associated with the THC Ministry were indicted by a Federal grand jury in Honolulu on Marijuana Possession and Trafficking charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khon2.com/news/local/story/New-details-in-the-major-marijuana-bust-on-the/HiwkKerHDU62ApTAR0iMrQ.cspx|title=New details in the major marijuana bust on the Big Island|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616212307/http://www.khon2.com/news/local/story/New-details-in-the-major-marijuana-bust-on-the/HiwkKerHDU62ApTAR0iMrQ.cspx|archivedate=2011-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie served four years in jail following an April 2014 sentencing, and is on probation until 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bigislandvideonews.com/2014/04/30/thc-minister-roger-christie-sentenced/|title=THC Minister Roger Christie sentenced|date=2014-04-30|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
THC Ministry believes that ''"cultivation and enjoyment of cannabis sacrament is a fundamental human right provided by God and protected by the Constitution."'' It states cannabis is the original [[sacrament]] of [[Hebrews|Hebrew]], [[Christian]], [[Muslim]], [[Hindu]], [[Shinto]], [[Buddhist]], [[Rastafari movement|Rasta]] and more, and fulfills the prophesies to 'feed all our hungers'. It believes cannabis to be one of the main ingredients in the original [[Holy anointing oil|Anointing Oil]], as described in the [[Bible]]. Some members also believe it is the substance used in the [[burnt offering]]s at the altar and special occasions throughout the Bible numerous times.

==History==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:THC_Ministry_Court_stipulation.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Court stipulation recognizing the Religion of Jesus Church as a ''bona fide'' religion and acknowledging a member's sincere belief in the sacramental use of cannabis.]] --&gt;

THC Ministry, which is the abbreviated and popularized name for the original Hawai'i Ministry of Cannabis Sacrament and all of its chapters, was founded in June 2000 by [[Roger Christie]] in [[Hawaii]]. It is present in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]] and many [[U.S. state|states of the]] United States, including [[Alabama]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Michigan]], [[Missouri]], [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[Ohio]], [[Oregon]], [[Wyoming]], [[Texas]], and [[Tennessee]] with at least one other chapter forming in [[New York (state)|New York]]. It is an officially registered religion in many countries on different continents.

According to the THC Ministry, identification of cannabis specifically as an ingredient of the holy anointing oil, can be found in the [[Torah]] (Five Books of Moses), Exodus 30:23; contrary to the translation of the Septuagint and supported by both Aramaic translations (the [[Targum]] and the [[Peshitta]]).

The Hebrew Bible possibly mentions cannabis in [[:s:Bible (American Standard)/Exodus#30:23|Exodus 30:23]] where God commands [[Moses]] to make a [[holy anointing oil|holy oil]] of [[myrrh]], [[cinnamon]], ''qěnēh bośem'' and [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cassia]] to anoint the [[Ark of the Covenant]] and the Tabernacle (and thus God's Temple in Jerusalem).&lt;ref name=kaneh1&gt;Rabbi Kaplan. 1981. ''The Living Torah'', pg. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Biblical Hebrew term ''qěnēh bośem'' ('''קְנֵה בֹּשֶׂם'''), possibly derived from [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''kanubi''{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}},  literally "reed of balm", probably&lt;ref name="labarre1980"&gt;[[Weston La Barre]]. 1980. ''Culture in Context; Selected Writings of Weston Labarre''. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to cannabis according to some etymologists,&lt;ref name="bookofgrass"&gt;Benetowa, Sara = ([[Sula Benet]]). 1936. Tracing one word through different languages. Institute of Anthropological Sciences, Warsaw. Reprinted 1967 In: ''The Book of Grass''. George Andrews and Simon Vinkenoog (eds.) Grove Press, New York, "pp. 15-18.&lt;/ref&gt; but is more commonly thought to be lemon grass, calamus, or even sweet cane, due to widespread translation issues.&lt;ref name="low1924"&gt;Immanuel Löw. 1924-1934. ''Flora der Juden'', vol. I-IV. Reprinted 1967. Hildeshein: Georg Olms (source not confirmed)&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, the specific anointing oil in question, is a special herbal formula that functions as a kind of polish and fragrance for the Ark and Tabernacle, and the Bible forbids its manufacture and use to anoint people ([[:s:Bible (American Standard)/Exodus#30:31|Exodus 30:31-33]]) 
with the exception of the Aaronic priesthood ([[:s:Bible (American Standard)/Exodus#30:30|Exodus 30:30]]).

In [[Aryeh Kaplan]]'s contemporary English translation of the Five Books, "The Living Torah", he includes a picture of the hemp plant as an illustration (p.&amp;nbsp;442).

A judge in Colorado ruled that a man's belief that marijuana was a sacrament did not rise to the level of religion and ordered him to pay $450 in fines and costs and serve 15 hours of community service as a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9news.com/news/local/article.aspx?storyid=134209&amp;catid=346|title=Colo. man who claims pot as sacrament is convicted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Terence McKenna was born and raised in [[Paonia, Colorado]],&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pinchbeck2003pp232-5"&gt;
{{cite book |last= Pinchbeck |first= Daniel |authorlink= Daniel Pinchbeck |title= [[Breaking Open the Head|Breaking Open the Head: A Psychedelic Journey into the Heart of Contemporary Shamanism]] |year=  2003 |publisher= [[Broadway Books]] |isbn= 0767907434 |pages= 231–8 |ref= {{SfnRef|Pinchbeck|2003}}}}

&lt;/ref&gt; 
with Irish ancestry on his father's side of the family.&lt;ref name=Brotherhood&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Dennis McKenna]]|title=The Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss: My Life with Terence McKenna|date=2012|publisher=Polaris Publications|isbn=978-0-87839-637-5|edition=1st|language=English|type=ebook|pp=71|ref= {{SfnRef|McKenna, Dennis|2012}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKenna developed a hobby of fossil-hunting in his youth and from this he acquired a deep scientific appreciation of nature.{{Sfn|McKenna, Dennis|2012|pp=115}} He also became interested in psychology at a young age, reading [[Carl Jung]]'s book ''[[Psychology and Alchemy]]'' at the age of 10.&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt; This was the same age McKenna first became aware of magic mushrooms, when reading an essay titled "Seeking the Magic Mushroom" which appeared in the May 13, 1957 edition of [[LIFE magazine]].&lt;ref name="Vice Mushroom"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lin |first1=Tao |title=Psilocybin, the Mushroom, and Terence McKenna |url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/yvqqpj/psilocybin-the-mushroom-and-terence-mckenna-439 |website=Vice |accessdate=12 July 2018 |date=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 16 McKenna moved to [[Los Altos, California]] to live with family friends for a year. He finished high school in [[Lancaster, California]].&lt;ref name="tripzine"/&gt; In 1963, he was introduced to the literary world of psychedelics through ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' and ''[[Heaven and Hell (essay)|Heaven and Hell]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]] and certain issues of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' which published articles on psychedelics.&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt;&lt;ref name="tripzine"/&gt;

McKenna said that one of his early psychedelic experiences with morning glory seeds showed him "that there was something there worth pursuing",&lt;ref name="tripzine"/&gt; and in interviews he claimed to have smoked [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] daily since his teens.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit" /&gt;

===Studying and traveling===
In 1965, McKenna enrolled in the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and was accepted into the [[Tussman Experimental College]].&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"/&gt; In 1967, while in college, he discovered and began studying shamanism through the study of Tibetan folk religion.&lt;ref name=Mavericks/&gt;{{sfn|McKenna|1992a|pp=204–17}} That same year, which he called his "opium and kabbala phase"&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt;{{sfn|McKenna|1993|p=215}} he traveled to [[Jerusalem]], where he met Kathleen Harrison, an [[ethnobotanist]] who would later become his wife.&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"/&gt;{{sfn|McKenna|1993|p=215}}

In 1969, McKenna traveled to [[Nepal]] led by his interest in Tibetan painting and hallucinogenic [[shamanism]].{{sfn|McKenna|1993|pp=55–58}} He sought out [[shaman]] of the [[Bon]] tradition, which predated{{dubious|date=May 2017}} Tibetan [[Buddhism]], trying to learn more about the shamanic use of visionary plants.&lt;ref name="Pinchbeck2003pp232-5" /&gt; During his time there, he also studied the Tibetan language{{sfn|McKenna|1993|pp=55–58}} and worked as a [[hashish]] smuggler,&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt; until "one of his Bombay-to-Aspen shipments fell into the hands of U.&amp;nbsp;S. Customs."{{sfn|McKenna|1993|pp=22–3}} He then wandered through southeast Asia viewing ruins,{{sfn|McKenna|1993|pp=22–3}} and spent time as a professional [[butterfly]] collector in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times Obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Omni1993 /&gt;

After the partial completion of his studies, and his mother's death{{sfn|McKenna|1993|pp=1–13}} from cancer in 1971,{{sfn|McKenna|1993|p=23}} McKenna, his brother [[Dennis McKenna|Dennis]], and three friends traveled to the [[Colombian Amazon]] in search of ''[[oo-koo-hé]]'', a plant preparation containing [[dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT).&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;{{sfn|McKenna|1993|pp=1–13}}&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt; Instead of [[oo-koo-hé]] they found fields full of gigantic ''[[Psilocybe cubensis]]'' mushrooms, which became the new focus of the expedition.&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pinchbeck2003pp232-5" /&gt;{{sfn|McKenna|1993|pp=1–13}}&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt; In [[La Chorrera, Colombia|La Chorrera]], at the urging of his brother, McKenna was the subject of a psychedelic experiment&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt; in which the brothers attempted to bond [[harmine]] (harmine is another psychedelic compound they used [[synergistically]] with the mushrooms) with their own [[neural]] [[DNA]], through the use of a set specific vocal techniques. They hypothesised this would give them access to the collective memory of the [[human]] [[species]], and would manifest the [[alchemists]]' [[Philosopher's Stone]] which they viewed as a "hyperdimensional union of spirit and matter".&lt;ref name=GyusEOTR/&gt; McKenna claimed the experiment put him in contact with "[[Logos]]": an informative, [[divine]] voice he believed was universal to visionary religious experience.{{sfn|McKenna|1993|p=194}} McKenna also often referred to the voice as "the mushroom", and "the teaching voice" amongst other names.&lt;ref name="Vice Mushroom" /&gt; The voice's reputed revelations and his brother's simultaneous peculiar psychedelic experience prompted him to explore the structure of an [[King Wen sequence|early form]] of the ''I Ching'', which led to his "Novelty Theory".&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=ScientificAHorgan /&gt;
During their stay in the Amazon, McKenna also became romantically involved with his interpreter, Ev.{{sfn|McKenna|1993|p=3}}

In 1972, McKenna returned to [[U.C. Berkeley]] to finish his studies&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"/&gt; and in 1975, he graduated with a degree in ecology, [[shamanism]], and conservation of [[natural resources]].&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt;&lt;ref name= "LA Times Obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Omni1993"&gt;{{cite news |title= Terence McKenna |magazine= [[Omni (magazine)|Omni]] |year= 1993 |volume= 15 |issue= 7 |pages= 69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1975, after parting with his girlfriend Ev earlier in the year,{{sfn|McKenna|1993|pp=205–7}} McKenna began a relationship with his future wife and the mother of his two children, Kathleen Harrison.&lt;ref name=ScientificAHorgan&gt;{{cite web |last= Horgan |first= John |authorlink= John Horgan (American journalist) |title= Was psychedelic guru Terence McKenna goofing about 2012 prophecy? |url= http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2012/06/06/was-psychedelic-guru-terence-mckenna-goofing-about-2012-prophecy/ |publisher= [[Scientific American]] |type= blog |accessdate= 2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Obit" /&gt;{{sfn|McKenna|1993|p=215}}&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt;

Soon after graduating, McKenna and Dennis published a book inspired by their Amazon experiences, ''The Invisible Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens and the I Ching''.&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Supernatural /&gt; The brothers' experiences in the Amazon would later be the main focus of McKenna's book ''True Hallucinations'', published in 1993.&lt;ref name=Pinchbeck2003pp232-5 /&gt; McKenna also began lecturing&lt;ref name="NYT Obit" /&gt; locally around [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and started appearing on some underground radio stations.&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt;

===Psilocybin mushroom cultivation===
[[File:Psilocybin Magic Mushroom Growers Guide book cover.jpg|thumb|upright=0.78| ''Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide'' (1986 revised edition)]]

===Mid- to later life===

====Public speaking====
In the early 1980s, McKenna began to speak publicly on the topic of psychedelic drugs, becoming one of the pioneers of the psychedelic movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Inner Paths To Outer Space: Journeys to Alien Worlds Through Psychedelics and Other Spiritual Technologies |year= 2008 |location= Rochester, VT |publisher= Inner Traditions |isbn= 9781594772245 |page= 149 |editor1-first= Rick |editor1-last= Strassman |editor1-link= Rick Strassman |editor2-first= Slawek |editor2-last= Wojtowicz |editor3-first= Luis Eduardo |editor3-last= Luna |editor4-first= Ede |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last= Frecska |chapter= Ch. 6: Magic Mushrooms |first= Slawek |last= Wojtowicz}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main focus was on the plant-based psychedelics such as [[psilocybin mushroom]]s (which were the catalyst for his career),&lt;ref name=Pinchbeck2003pp232-5 /&gt; [[ayahuasca]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], and the plant derivative [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]].&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt; He conducted lecture tours and workshops&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt; promoting natural psychedelics as a way to explore universal mysteries, stimulate the imagination, and re-establish a harmonious relationship with nature.&lt;ref name= "Toop1993"&gt;{{cite news |last= Toop |first= David |authorlink= David Toop |date= February 18, 1993 |newspaper= [[The Times]] |title= Sounds like a radical vision; The Shamen and Terence McKenna |department= Rock Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though associated with the [[New Age]] and [[Human Potential Movement]]s, McKenna himself had little patience for New Age sensibilities.&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dery21C /&gt;&lt;ref name=ScientificAHorgan /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Sharkey2000"&gt;{{cite news |last= Sharkey |first= Alix |date= April 15, 2000 |title= Terence McKenna |type= Obituary |newspaper= [[The Independent]] |page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeatedly stressed the importance and primacy of the "felt presence of direct experience", as opposed to [[dogma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |last= McKenna |first= Terence  |type= lecture |chapter= 181-McKennaErosEschatonQA |title= Psychedelia: Psychedelic Salon ALL Episodes |date= 1994 |accessdate= 2014-04-11|format= MP3 |time= 32:00 |editor-last= Hagerty |editor-first= Lorenzo |url= https://archive.org/details/PsychedelicSalon-all-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to psychedelic drugs, McKenna spoke on a wide array of subjects&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt; including; [[shamanism]]; [[metaphysics]]; [[alchemy]]; [[language]]; culture; [[empowerment|self-empowerment]]; [[environmentalism]], [[techno-paganism]]; [[artificial intelligence]]; [[evolution]]; [[extraterrestrials]]; science and [[scientism]]; [[worldwide web|the Web]]; [[virtual reality]] (which he saw as a way to artistically communicate the experience of psychedelics); and [[aesthetic]] theory, specifically about art/visual experience as ''information'' representing the significance of hallucinatory visions experienced under the influence of psychedelics.

McKenna published several books in the early-to-mid-1990s including: ''The Archaic Revival''; ''Food of the Gods''; and ''True Hallucinations''.&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pinchbeck2003pp232-5 /&gt;&lt;ref name= "LA Times Obit"/&gt; Hundreds of hours of McKenna's public lectures were recorded either [[professionally]] or [[bootleg recording|bootlegged]] and have been produced on [[cassette tape]], CD and MP3.&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt; Segments of his talks have gone on to be sampled by many musicians and [[DJ's]].&lt;ref name= "Partridge2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt;

McKenna was a colleague and close friend of [[chaos theory|chaos mathematician]] [[Ralph Abraham (mathematician)|Ralph Abraham]], and author and [[biologist]] [[Rupert Sheldrake]]. He conducted several public and many private [[debates]] with them from 1982 until his death.{{Sfn|Abraham, McKenna &amp; Sheldrake|1998|loc=Preface}}{{Sfn|Abraham, McKenna &amp; Sheldrake|1992|p=11}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Sheldrake – McKenna – Abraham Trialogues |work= sheldrake.org |url= http://www.sheldrake.org/Trialogues/ |editor-last= Rice |editor-first= Paddy Rose |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131128060018/http://www.sheldrake.org/Trialogues/ |archivedate= November 28, 2013 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These debates were known as ''trialogues'' and some of the discussions were later published in the books: ''Trialogues at the Edge of the West'' and ''The Evolutionary Mind''.&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt;{{Sfn|Abraham, McKenna &amp; Sheldrake|1998|loc=Preface}}

====Botanical Dimensions====

[[File:Botanical Dimensions ethnobotanical preserve in Hawaii.jpg|thumb|Botanical Dimensions [[ethnobotanical]] preserve in [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]].]]

In 1985, McKenna founded Botanical Dimensions with his then-wife, Kathleen Harrison.&lt;ref name= "LA Times Obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "BDP"/&gt; Botanical Dimensions is a nonprofit [[ethnobotanical]] preserve on the Big Island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]],&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt; established to collect, protect, [[Plant propagation|propagate]], and understand plants of ethno-medical significance and their [[Folklore|lore]], and appreciate, study, and educate others about plants and mushrooms felt to be significant to cultural integrity and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] well-being.&lt;ref name=BDPandP&gt;{{cite web |title= Botanical Dimensions Plants and People |website= botanicaldimensions.org |url= http://botanicaldimensions.org/#/0/14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|19|acre|adj=on}} [[botanical]] garden&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt; is a repository containing thousands of plants that have been used by [[indigenous people]] of the [[tropical regions]], and includes a [[database]] of information related to their purported healing properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nollman |first= Jim |title= Why We Garden: Cultivating a Sense of Place |year= 1994 |publisher= [[Henry Holt and Company|Henry Holt &amp; Co.]] |isbn= 9780805027198 |page= 181}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKenna was involved until 1992, when he retired from the project,&lt;ref name=BDP&gt;{{cite web |title= Botanical Dimensions People |website= botanicaldimensions.org |url= http://botanicaldimensions.org/contact-botanical-dimensions/#/0/20}}&lt;/ref&gt; following his and Kathleen's divorce earlier in the year.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"&gt;{{cite news |last= Martin |first= Douglas |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/09/us/terence-mckenna-53-dies-patron-of-psychedelic-drugs.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title= Terence McKenna, 53, dies; Patron of psychedelic drugs |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= September 10, 2013 |accessdate= 2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen still manages Botanical Dimensions as its president and projects director.&lt;ref name= "BDPandP"/&gt; After their divorce, McKenna moved to Hawaii permanently, where he built a modernist house&lt;ref name="NYT Obit" /&gt; and created a [[gene bank]] of rare plants near his home.&lt;ref name= "LA Times Obit"/&gt; Previously, he had split his time between Hawaii and [[Occidental, California|Occidental, CA]].

===Death===
[[File:Hanna jon 1999 mckenna terence.jpg|thumb|Terence McKenna during a panel discussion at the 1999 AllChemical Arts Conference, held at Kona, Hawaii.]]
McKenna was a longtime sufferer of [[migraine]]s, but on 22 May 1999 he began to have unusually extreme and painful [[headaches]]. He then collapsed due to a [[brain seizure]].&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt; McKenna was diagnosed with [[glioblastoma multiforme]], a highly aggressive form of [[Brain tumor|brain cancer]].&lt;ref name=Dery21C&gt;{{cite web |first= Mark |last= Dery |authorlink= Mark Dery |title= Terence McKenna: The inner elf |url= http://www.21cmagazine.com/Terence-McKenna-The-Inner-Elf |magazine= 21•C Magazine |accessdate= 2014-02-07 |year= 2001 |origyear= 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pinchbeck2003pp232-5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt; For the next several months he underwent various treatments, including experimental [[gamma knife]] radiation treatment. According to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, McKenna was worried that his [[tumor]] may have been caused by his psychedelic drug use, or his 35 years of daily cannabis smoking, however his doctors assured him there was no causal relation.&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;{{cite news |last= Davis |first= Erik |authorlink= Erik Davis |date= May 2000 |title= Terence McKenna's last trip |magazine= [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |issue= 8.05 |accessdate= 2013-09-10 |url= https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.05/mckenna.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1999, McKenna described his thoughts concerning his impending death to interviewer [[Erik Davis]]:

{{quote|I always thought death would come on the freeway in a few horrifying moments, so you'd have no time to sort it out. Having months and months to look at it and think about it and talk to people and hear what they have to say, it's a kind of blessing. It's certainly an opportunity to grow up and get a grip and sort it all out. Just being told by an unsmiling guy in a white coat that you're going to be dead in four months definitely turns on the lights. ... It makes life rich and poignant. When it first happened, and I got these diagnoses, I could see the light of eternity, à la [[William Blake]], shining through every leaf. I mean, a bug walking across the ground moved me to tears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://techgnosis.com/terence-mckenna-vs-the-black-hole/ |title= Terence McKenna Vs. the Black Hole |first= Erik |last= Davis |authorlink= Erik Davis |website= techgnosis.com |date=January 13, 2005 |accessdate=2012-09-12 |type= Excerpts from the CD, ''Terence McKenna: The Last Interview''}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

McKenna died on April 3, 2000, at the age of 53.&lt;ref name=Dery21C /&gt;&lt;ref name=ScientificAHorgan /&gt;&lt;ref name= "NYT Obit"/&gt;

===Library fire and insect collection===
On February 7, 2007, McKenna's library of over 3000 rare books and personal notes was destroyed in a fire at the [[Esalen Institute]] in [[Big Sur]], [[California]]. An [[Collection catalog|index]] of McKenna's library was made by his brother Dennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Frauenfelder |first= Mark |authorlink= Mark Frauenfelder |url=http://www.boingboing.net/2007/02/22/terence-mckennas-lib.html |title= Terence McKenna's library destroyed in fire |work= [[Boing Boing]] |date= February 22, 2007 |accessdate= 2012-09-12 |type= [[Collaborative blog|group blog]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IA-techgno"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Erik|title=Terence McKenna's Ex-Library|url=http://www.techgnosis.com/chunks.php?sec=journal&amp;cat=&amp;file=chunkfrom-2007-02-13-2307-0.txt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004131122/http://www.techgnosis.com/chunks.php?sec=journal&amp;cat=&amp;file=chunkfrom-2007-02-13-2307-0.txt|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 October 2012|publisher=Internet Archive|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter, the artist and photographer Klea McKenna, subsequently preserved his insect collection, turning it into a gallery installation, and then publishing it in book form as ''The Butterfly Hunter'', featuring her selected photos of 122 insects—119 butterflies/moths and three beetles or beetle-like insects—from a set of over 2000 he collected between 1969 and 1972, as well as maps showing his collecting routes through the rainforests of Southeast Asia and South America.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7b7dbe/the-butterfly-hunter-by-klea-mckenna-874 'The Butterfly Hunter' by Klea McKenna] By Tao Lin, Sep 9 2014, 7:36pm, Vice&lt;/ref&gt; McKenna had intensively studied [[lepidoptera]] and [[entomology]] in the 1960s, and as part his studies hunted for butterflies primarily in [[Colombia]] and [[Indonesia]]. McKenna's insect collection was consistent with his interest in Victorian-era explorers and naturalists, and his worldview based on close observation of nature. In the 1970s, when he was still collecting, he became quite squeamish and guilt-ridden about the necessity of killing butterflies in order to collect and classify them, and that's what led him to stop his entomological studies, according to his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7b7dbe/the-butterfly-hunter-by-klea-mckenna-874 'The Butterfly Hunter' by Klea McKenna] By Tao Lin, Sep 9 2014, 7:36pm, Vice&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==

===Psychedelics===
Terence McKenna advocated the exploration of altered states of mind via the ingestion of naturally occurring psychedelic substances;&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Supernatural&gt;{{cite book |title= Supernatural: Meetings with the Ancient Teachers of Mankind |year= 2006 |origyear= 2005 |location= London |publisher= [[Random House|Arrow]] |isbn= 9780099474159 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=FpMhxNgf97YC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PT217#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 556–7] |first= Graham |last= Hancock |author-link= Graham Hancock}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NobleSavage /&gt; for example, and in particular, as facilitated by the ingestion of high doses of [[psychedelic mushrooms]],&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt;&lt;ref name=StametsPMOTW /&gt; [[ayahuasca]], and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]],&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt; which he believed was the [[apotheosis]] of the psychedelic experience. 
He was less enthralled with synthetic drugs,&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt; stating, "I think drugs should come from the natural world and be use-tested by shamanically orientated cultures...one cannot predict the long-term effects of a drug produced in a laboratory."&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt; McKenna always stressed the responsible use of psychedelic plants, saying, "Experimenters should be very careful. One must build up to the experience. These are bizarre dimensions of extraordinary power and beauty. There is no set rule to avoid being overwhelmed, but move carefully, reflect a great deal, and always try to map experiences back onto the history of the race and the philosophical and religious accomplishments of the species. All the compounds are potentially dangerous, and all compounds, at sufficient doses or repeated over time, involve risks. The library is the first place to go when looking into taking a new compound."{{sfn|McKenna|1992a|p=43}} He also recommended, and often spoke of taking, what he called "heroic doses",&lt;ref name=Supernatural /&gt; which he defined as five grams of dried psilocybin mushrooms,&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson&gt;{{cite news |first= Mark |last= Jacobson |title= Terence McKenna the brave prophet of The next psychedelic revolution, or is his cosmic egg just a little bit cracked? |magazine= [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |date= June 1992 |pages= 107–38 |id=ESQ199206 |url= https://archive.org/details/1992TerenceMcKennaEaquire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wadsworth|first1=Jennifer|title=Federal Approval Brings MDMA From Club to Clinic|url=http://www.metroactive.com/features/MDMA-Molly-Drugs-Psychedelic.html|website=Metro Active|publisher=[[Metro Silicon Valley]]|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; taken alone, on an empty stomach, in silent darkness, and with eyes closed.&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt; He believed that when taken this way one could expect a profound visionary experience,&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt; believing it is only when "slain" by the power of the mushroom that the message becomes clear.&lt;ref name=StametsPMOTW&gt;{{cite book |title= Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World: An Identification Guide |year= 1996 |location= Berkeley, CA |publisher= [[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn= 9780898158397 |page= 36 |first= Paul |last= Stamets |authorlink= Paul Stamets |chapter= 5. Good Tips For Great Trips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although McKenna avoided giving his allegiance to any one interpretation (part of his rejection of [[monotheism]]), he was open to the idea of psychedelics as being "trans-dimensional travel". He proposed that DMT sent one to a "parallel dimension"&lt;ref name=ScientificAHorgan /&gt; and that psychedelics literally enabled an individual to encounter "higher dimensional [[entities]]",{{sfn|Pinchbeck|2003|p=193}} or what could be [[ancestor]]s, or [[spirit]]s of the Earth,&lt;ref name=invisible /&gt; saying that if you can trust your own perceptions it appears that you are entering an "ecology of [[souls]]".{{sfn|Pinchbeck|2003|p=247}} McKenna also put forward the idea that psychedelics were "doorways into the [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaian]] mind",&lt;ref name=NobleSavage /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Trip1993"&gt;{{cite news |last= Trip |first= Gabriel |date= May 2, 1993 |title= Tripping, but not falling |newspaper= [[The New York Times|New York Times]] |page= A6}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that "the planet has a kind of intelligence, it can actually open a channel of communication with an individual human being" and that the psychedelic plants were the facilitators of this communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= [[The Shamen|Shamen]] |year= 1992 |title= [[Boss Drum]] |format= CD and MP3 |time= 4:50 |chapter= Track 10: RE: Evolution |publisher= [[Epic Records|Epic]] |oclc= 27056837}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Gaian mind |first= Terence |last= McKenna |url= http://deoxy.org/gaia/g_mind.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/19990203035348/http://deoxy.org/gaia/g_mind.htm |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 1999-02-03 |website= deoxy.org |type= cut-up from the works of Terence McKenna }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more radical version of [[biophysicist]] [[Francis Crick]]'s [[hypothesis]] of directed [[panspermia]], McKenna speculated on the idea that psilocybin mushrooms may be a species of high intelligence,&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt; which may have arrived on this planet as spores migrating through space&lt;ref name=ScientificAHorgan /&gt;{{sfn|Pinchbeck|2003|p=234}} and which are attempting to establish a [[symbiotic]] relationship with human beings. He postulated that "intelligence, not life, but intelligence may have come here [to [[Earth]]] in this spore-bearing life form". He said, "I think that theory will probably be vindicated. I think in a hundred years if people do biology they will think it quite silly that people once thought that [[spores]] could not be blown from one star system to another by cosmic [[radiation pressure]]," and also believed that "few people are in a position to judge its extraterrestrial potential, because few people in the orthodox sciences have ever experienced the full spectrum of psychedelic effects that are unleashed."&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dery21C /&gt;{{sfn|McKenna|1992a|pp=204–17}}

McKenna was opposed to Christianity&lt;ref name= "Rabey1994"&gt;{{cite news |last= Rabey |first= Steve |date= August 13, 1994 |title= Instant karma: Psychedelic drug use on the rise as a quick route to spirituality |newspaper= [[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|Colorado Springs Gazette – Telegraph]] |page= E1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most forms of [[organized religion]] or [[guru]]-based forms of spiritual awakening, favouring [[shamanism]], which he believed was the broadest spiritual paradigm available, stating that: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;What I think happened is that in the world of prehistory all religion was experiential, and it was based on the pursuit of ecstasy through plants. And at some time, very early, a group interposed itself between people and direct experience of the 'Other.' This created hierarchies, priesthoods, theological systems, castes, ritual, taboos. Shamanism, on the other hand, is an experiential science that deals with an area where we know nothing. It is important to remember that our epistemological tools have developed very unevenly in the West. We know a tremendous amount about what is going on in the heart of the atom, but we know absolutely nothing about the nature of the mind.{{sfn|McKenna|1992a|p=242}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Either philosophically or religiously, he expressed admiration for [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]], [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Plato]], [[Gnostic Christianity]] and [[Alchemy]], while regarding the Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]] as his favorite philosopher.&lt;ref name="Stone2"&gt;{{cite AV media |last= McKenna |first= Terence  |type= lecture |chapter= Unfolding the Stone 1 |title= Psychedelia: Raw Archives of Terence McKenna Talks |date= 1992 |format= MP3 |time= 17:30 |editor-last= Damer |editor-first= Bruce |url= https://archive.org/download/PsychedeliaRawArchivesOfTerenceMckennaTalks/UnfoldingTheStone1.mp3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKenna also expressed admiration for the works of writers including [[Aldous Huxley]],&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt; [[James Joyce]], whose book ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' he called "the quintessential work of art, or at least work of literature of the 20th century,"&lt;ref name="SurfingFW"&gt;{{cite AV media |last= McKenna |first= Terence  |type= lecture |chapter= SurfingFinnegansWake |title= Psychedelia: Raw Archives of Terence McKenna Talks |date= 1990–1999 |format= MP3 |time= 0:45 |editor-last= Damer |editor-first= Bruce |url= https://archive.org/download/PsychedeliaRawArchivesOfTerenceMckennaTalks/SurfingFinnegansWake.mp3}}&lt;/ref&gt; science fiction writer [[Philip K.

In his book ''Food of the Gods'', McKenna proposed that the transformation from humans' early ancestors ''[[Homo erectus]]'' to the species ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' mainly had to do with the addition of the mushroom ''[[Psilocybe cubensis]]'' in its diet,&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph8thingsMush /&gt;{{sfn|McKenna|1992b|pp=56–60}} an event that according to his theory took place in about 100,000 BCE (which is when he believed that the species diverged from the [[Homo]] genus).&lt;ref name= "LA Times Obit"&gt;{{cite news |title= Terence McKenna; Promoter of psychedelic drug use |date= April 7, 2000 |newspaper= ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |page= B6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|McKenna|1992b|p=54}} McKenna based his theory on the main effects, or alleged effects, produced by the mushroom&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt; while citing studies by [[Roland L. Fischer|Roland Fischer]] et al. from the late 1960s to early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Fischer |first1= Roland |last2= Hill |first2= Richard |first3= Karen |last3= Thatcher |first4= James |last4= Scheib  |year= 1970 |title= Psilocybin-Induced contraction of nearby visual space |journal= Agents and Actions |volume= 1 |issue= 4 |pages= 190–7 |pmid= 5520365 |doi= 10.1007/BF01965761}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|McKenna|1992b|p=57}}

McKenna stated that due to the [[desertification]] of the [[African continent]] at that time, human forerunners were forced from the increasingly shrinking tropical [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] in search of new food sources.&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt; He believed they would have been following large herds of wild cattle whose dung harbored the insects that, he proposed, were undoubtedly part of their new diet, and would have spotted and started eating ''[[Psilocybe cubensis]]'', a dung-loving mushroom often found growing out of [[cowpat]]s.&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dery21C /&gt;&lt;ref name=NobleSavage /&gt;{{sfn|Znamenski|2007|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JFgelrgGSIMC&amp;pg=PA138 138-9]}}

[[File:Psilocybe Cubensis.JPG|thumb|left|[[Psilocybe cubensis]]: the psilocybin-containing mushroom central to McKenna's "stoned ape" theory of human evolution.]]

McKenna's hypothesis was that low doses of psilocybin improve [[visual acuity]], particularly edge detection, meaning that the presence of psilocybin in the diet of early pack hunting [[primates]] caused the individuals who were consuming psilocybin mushrooms to be better [[hunters]] than those who were not, resulting in an increased food supply and in turn a higher rate of [[reproductive]] success.&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dery21C /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vice Mushroom" /&gt;&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt;&lt;ref name=NobleSavage /&gt; Then at slightly higher doses, he contended, the mushroom acts to sexually arouse, leading to a higher level of attention, more energy in the [[organism]], and potential [[erection]] in the [[males]],&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dery21C /&gt; rendering it even more evolutionarily beneficial, as it would result in more [[offspring]].&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt;&lt;ref name=NobleSavage /&gt;{{sfn|McKenna|1992b|pp=56–60}} At even higher doses, McKenna proposed that the mushroom would have acted to "dissolve boundaries," promoting community bonding and group sexual activities.&lt;ref name=Pinchbeck2003pp232-5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NobleSavage /&gt; Consequently, there would be a mixing of [[genes]], greater [[genetic diversity]], and a [[communal]] sense of responsibility for the group offspring.{{sfn|McKenna|1992b|p=59}} At these higher doses, McKenna also argued that psilocybin would be triggering activity in the "language-forming region of the brain", manifesting as music and [[vision (spirituality)|visions]],&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt; thus catalyzing the emergence of language in early hominids by expanding "their arboreally evolved repertoire of troop signals."&lt;ref name=Dery21C /&gt;&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt; He also pointed out that psilocybin would dissolve the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] and "religious concerns would be at the forefront of the [[tribe]]'s [[consciousness]], simply because of the power and strangeness of the experience itself."&lt;ref name=NobleSavage /&gt;{{sfn|McKenna|1992b|p=59}}

Therefore, according to McKenna, access to and [[ingestion]] of mushrooms was an [[evolutionary]] advantage to humans' [[omnivorous]] [[hunter-gatherer]] [[ancestors]],&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt;{{sfn|Znamenski|2007|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JFgelrgGSIMC&amp;pg=PA138 138-9]}} also providing humanities first religious impulse.{{sfn|Znamenski|2007|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JFgelrgGSIMC&amp;pg=PA138 138-9]}}{{sfn|Pinchbeck|2003|p=194}} He believed that psilocybin mushrooms were the "evolutionary catalyst"&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt; from which language, projective imagination, the arts, religion, philosophy, science, and all of human culture sprang.&lt;ref name=Dery21C /&gt;&lt;ref name=ScientificAHorgan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt;{{sfn|Znamenski|2007|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JFgelrgGSIMC&amp;pg=PA138 138-9]}}

McKenna's hypothesis concerning the influence of psylocibin mushrooms on human evolution, is known as "the 'stoned ape' theory."&lt;ref name="Vice Mushroom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NobleSavage"&gt;{{cite book |title= War and the Noble Savage: A Critical Inquiry Into Recent Accounts of Violence Amongst Uncivilized Peoples |year= 2009 |location= London |publisher= Dreamflesh |isbn= 0955419611 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=a9uCXbV90vMC&amp;pg=PA63 63–6] |author= Gyrus|chapter= Appendix II: The Stoned Ape Hypothesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph8thingsMush /&gt;

McKenna's "stoned ape" theory has not received attention from the scientific community and has been criticized for a relative lack of [[citation]] to any of the [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropological]] evidence informing our understanding of human origins. His ideas regarding psilocybin and visual acuity have been criticized by suggesting he misrepresented Fischer et al., who published studies about [[visual perception]] in terms of various specific [[parameters]], not acuity. Criticism has also been expressed due to the fact that in a separate study on psilocybin induced transformation of [[visual space]] Fischer et al. stated that psilocybin "may not be conducive to the survival of the [[organism]]". There is also a lack of scientific evidence that psilocybin increases sexual arousal, and even if it does, it does not necessarily entail an evolutionary advantage.&lt;ref name=AkersApes /&gt; Others have pointed to civilisations such as the [[Aztecs]], who used psychedelic mushrooms (at least among the Priestly class), that didn't reflect McKenna's model of how psychedelic-using cultures would behave, for example, by carrying out [[human sacrifice]].&lt;ref name=Pinchbeck2003pp232-5 /&gt; Although, it has been noted that psilocybin usage by the Aztec civilisation is far removed from the type of usage on which McKenna was speculating.&lt;ref name=NobleSavage /&gt; There are also examples of Amazonian tribes such as the [[Jívaro|Jivaro]] and the [[Yanomami]] who use [[ayahuasca]] [[Ceremony|ceremoniously]] and who are known to engage in violent behaviour. This, it has been argued, indicates the use of psychedelic plants does not necessarily suppress the ego and create harmonious societies.&lt;ref name=NobleSavage /&gt;

===Archaic revival===
One of the main themes running through McKenna's work, and the title of his second book, was the idea that [[Western civilization]] was undergoing what he called an "archaic revival".&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt;&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Tripping: An Anthology of True-Life Psychedelic Adventures |last= Hayes |first= Charles |chapter=Introduction: The Psychedelic [in] Society: A Brief Cultural History of Tripping |page=14 |year= 2000 |publisher= Penguin |isbn= 9781101157190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His notion was that Western society has become "sick" and is undergoing a "healing process", in the same way that the human body begins to produce [[antibodies]] when it feels itself to be sick, humanity as a collective whole (in the [[Jungian]] sense) was creating "strategies for overcoming the condition of dis-ease" and trying to cure itself, by what he termed as "a reversion to archaic values."  McKenna pointed to phenomena including [[surrealism]], [[abstract expressionism]], [[body piercing]] and [[tattooing]], [[psychedelic drug]] use, sexual permissiveness, [[jazz]], experimental dance, [[rave culture]], [[rock and roll]] and [[catastrophe theory]], amongst others, as his evidence that this process was underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |last= McKenna |first= Terence  |type= lecture |chapter= 181-McKennaErosEschatonQA |title= Psychedelia: Psychedelic Salon ALL Episodes |date= 1994 |accessdate= 2014-04-11| format= MP3 |time= 49:10 |editor-last= Hagerty |editor-first= Lorenzo |url= https://archive.org/details/PsychedelicSalon-all-}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Importance of Human Beings (a.k.a Eros and the Eschaton) |first= Terence |last= McKenna |url= http://www.matrixmasters.net/podcasts/TRANSCRIPTS/TMcK-ImportanceHumanBeings.html |website= matrixmasters.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |author1= Spacetime Continuum |authorlink1= Jonah Sharp |last2= McKenna |first2= Terence |last3= Kent |first3= Stephen |authorlink3= Stephen Kent (musician) |others= Visuals by Rose-X Media House |year= 2003 |origyear= 1993 |title= Alien Dreamtime |url= http://deoxy.org/t_adt.htm#arc |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/19970706120819/http://www.deoxy.org/t_adt.htm#arc |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 1997-07-06 |accessdate= 2014-02-01 |format= DVD, CD and MP3 |time= 3:08 |chapter= Archaic Revival |at= Track 1 |publisher= Magic Carpet Media: [[Astralwerks]] |oclc= 80061092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is linked to McKenna's "stoned ape" theory of human evolution, with him viewing the "archaic revival" as an impulse to return to the [[symbiotic]] and blissful relationship he believed humanity once had with the psilocybin mushroom.&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt;

In differentiating his idea from the "[[New Age]]", a term that he felt trivialized the significance of the next phase in human evolution, McKenna stated that: "The New Age is essentially [[humanistic psychology]] '80s-style, with the addition of neo-shamanism, channeling, crystal and herbal healing. The archaic revival is a much larger, more global phenomenon that assumes that we are recovering the social forms of the late [[neolithic]], and reaches far back in the 20th century to [[Freud]], to surrealism, to abstract expressionism, even to a phenomenon like [[National Socialism]] which is a negative force. But the stress on [[ritual]], on organized activity, on race/ancestor-consciousness – these are themes that have been worked out throughout the entire 20th century, and the archaic revival is an expression of that."&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt;{{sfn|McKenna|1992a|pp=204–17}}

===Novelty theory and Timewave Zero===
{{Redirect|Timewave Zero|album by Dutch [[Aggrotech]] band, [[Grendel (band)|Grendel]]|Timewave Zero (album)}} 
Novelty theory is a [[pseudoscientific]] idea{{r|bruce}}{{r|normark}} that purports to predict the ebb and flow of [[novelty]] in the universe as an [[inherent]] quality of time, proposing that time is not a constant but has various qualities tending toward either "habit" or "novelty".&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt; Habit, in this context, can be thought of as [[entropic]], repetitious, or conservative; and novelty as [[creativity|creative]], disjunctive, or progressive [[phenomena]].&lt;ref name=ScientificAHorgan /&gt; McKenna's idea was that the [[universe]] is an engine designed for the production and conservation of novelty and that as novelty increases, so does [[complexity]]. With each level of complexity achieved becoming the platform for a further ascent into complexity.&lt;ref name=ScientificAHorgan /&gt;

[[File:King Wen (I Ching).png|thumb| The 64 hexagrams from the [[King Wen sequence]] of the ''I Ching''.]]

The basis of the theory was originally conceived in the mid-1970s after McKenna's experiences with psilocybin mushrooms at La Chorrera in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] led him to closely study the [[King Wen sequence]] of the ''[[I Ching]]''.&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt;

In Asian [[Taoist]] philosophy the concept of opposing phenomena is represented by the [[yin and yang]]. Both are always present in everything, yet the amount of influence of each varies over time. The individual lines of the ''I Ching'' are made up of both Yin (broken lines) and Yang (solid lines).

When examining the [[King Wen sequence]] of the 64 hexagrams, McKenna noticed a pattern. He analysed the "degree of difference" between the hexagrams in each successive pair and claimed he found a statistical anomaly, which he believed suggested that the King Wen sequence was intentionally constructed,&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt; with the sequence of hexagrams ordered in a highly structured and artificial way, and that this pattern codified the nature of time's flow in the world.&lt;ref name=GyusEOTR/&gt; With the degrees of difference as numerical values, McKenna worked out a mathematical wave form based on
the 384 lines of change that make up the 64 hexagrams. He was able to [[Graph of a function|graph]] the data and this became the ''Novelty Time Wave''.&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;

[[File:Screenshot of Timewave Zero software.png|thumb|A screenshot of the ''Timewave Zero'' software (written by Peter J. Meyer) showing the timewave for the 25 years preceding a zero date of December 21, 2012.]]

Peter J. Meyer (Peter Johann Gustav Meyer) (born 1946), in collaboration with McKenna, studied and improved the foundations of novelty theory, working out a mathematical [[formula]] and developing the ''Timewave Zero'' software (the original version of which was completed by July 1987),&lt;ref&gt;United States Copyright Office - ''Timewave zero'' (Computer File: 1 vol. printout + magnetic disc) (Registration Date: July 13, 1987) - See: http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=TXu000288739&amp;Search_Code=REGS&amp;PID=On67hJJKiUHbTI8fcg4Vui7_w&amp;SEQ=20160922183840&amp;CNT=25&amp;HIST=1&lt;/ref&gt; enabling them to graph and explore its dynamics on a computer.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= John Major |authorlink= John Major Jenkins |title= The 2012 Story: The Myths, Fallacies, and Truth Behind the Most Intriguing Date in History |chapter= Early 2012 Books McKenna and Waters |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=M4Z5xOx1INcC&amp;pg=PT76 |publisher= [[Penguin Group|Penguin]] |year= 2009 |isbn= 9781101148822 |ref= {{SfnRef|Jenkins|2009}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dery21C /&gt; The graph was [[fractal]], it exhibited a pattern in which a given small section of the wave was found to be identical in form to a larger section of the wave.&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt; McKenna called this fractal modeling of time "temporal resonance", proposing it implied that larger intervals, occurring long ago, contained the same amount of information as shorter, more recent, intervals.&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;{{sfn|McKenna|1992a|pp=104–13}} He suggested the up-and-down pattern of the wave shows an ongoing wavering between habit and novelty respectively. With each successive [[iteration]] trending, at an increasing level, towards infinite novelty. So according to novelty theory, the pattern of time itself is speeding up, with a requirement of the theory being that infinite novelty will be reached on a specific date.&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;

McKenna suspected that notable events in history could be identified that would help him locate the time wave's end date&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt; and attempted to find the [[best-fit]] placement when matching the graph to the data field of human history.&lt;ref name=Dery21C /&gt; The last [[harmonic]] of the wave has a duration of 67.29 years.&lt;ref name="Dynamics of Hyperspace" /&gt; Population growth, peak oil, and pollution statistics were some of the factors that pointed him to an early twenty-first century end date and when looking for an extremely novel event in human history as a signal that the final phase had begun McKenna picked the dropping of the [[atomic bomb]] on [[Hiroshima]].&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dynamics of Hyperspace"&gt;{{cite web |first1= Ralph |last1= Abraham |author1link= Ralph Abraham (mathematician)|first2= Terence |last2= McKenna |url= http://www.ralph-abraham.org/talks/transcripts/hyperspace.html |title= Dynamics of Hyperspace |location=Santa Cruz, CA |date= June 1983 |website= ralph-abraham.org |accessdate= 2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This worked out to the graph reaching zero in mid-November 2012. When he later discovered that the end of the 13th baktun in the [[Maya calendar]] had been correlated by Western Maya scholars as December 21, 2012,{{ref label|A|Note a|a}} he adopted their end date instead.&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;&lt;ref name="skepsis"&gt;{{cite web|first= Sacha |last= Defesche |title= 'The 2012 Phenomenon': A historical and typological approach to a modern apocalyptic mythology |origyear= January–August 2007 |date= June 17, 2008 |publisher= [[Skepsis (organization)|Skepsis]] |url= http://skepsis.no/index.php?page=vis_nyhet&amp;NyhetID=131&amp;sok=1 |accessdate= 2011-04-29 |type= MA Thesis, Mysticism and Western Esotericism, [[University of Amsterdam]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref label|B|Note b|b}}

McKenna saw the [[universe]], in relation to novelty theory, as having a [[teleological]] [[attractor]] at the [[end time|end of time]],&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt; which increases interconnectedness and would eventually reach a [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] of infinite complexity. He also frequently referred to this as "the [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] object at the end of time."&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dery21C /&gt; When describing this model of the universe he stated that: "The universe is not being pushed from behind. The universe is being pulled from the future toward a goal that is as inevitable as a [[marble]] reaching the bottom of a bowl when you release it up near the rim. If you do that, you know the marble will roll down the side of the bowl, down, down, down – until eventually it comes to rest at the lowest energy state, which is the bottom of the bowl. That's precisely my model of human history. I'm suggesting that the universe is pulled toward a complex attractor that exists ahead of us in time, and that our ever-accelerating speed through the phenomenal world of connectivity and novelty is based on the fact that we are now very, very close to the attractor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= McKenna |first= Terence |title= Approaching Timewave Zero |url= http://www.fractal-timewave.com/articles/approaching_twz.htm |magazine= Magical Blend |issue= 44 |date= 1994|accessdate= 15 June 2015}}{{verify source|type=reprint|date=February 2014}}{{copyvio link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, according to McKenna's final interpretation of the data and positioning of the graph, on December 21, 2012 we would have been in the unique position in time where maximum novelty would be experienced.&lt;ref name=Mavericks /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt; An event he described as a "concrescence",&lt;ref name=Pinchbeck2003pp232-5 /&gt; a "tightening '[[gyre]]'" with everything flowing together. Speculating that "when the [[laws of physics]] are obviated, the universe disappears, and what is left is the tightly bound plenum, the [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]], able to express itself for itself, rather than only able to cast a shadow into [[physis]] as its reflection...It will be the entry of our species into '[[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]]', but it will appear to be the end of physical laws, accompanied by the release of the mind into the imagination."{{sfn|McKenna|1992a|p=101}}

Novelty theory is considered to be pseudoscience.{{r|bruce}}{{r|normark}} Among the criticisms are the use of [[numerology]] to derive dates of important events in world history,{{r|normark}} the arbitrary rather than calculated end date of the time wave&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt; and the apparent adjustment of the eschaton from November 2012 to December 2012 in order to coincide with the Maya calendar. Other purported dates do not fit the actual time frames: the date claimed for the emergence of ''Homo sapiens'' is inaccurate by 70,000 years, and the existence of the ancient [[Sumer]] and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] civilisations contradict the date he gave for the beginning of "historical time". Some projected dates have been criticised for having seemingly arbitrary labels, such as the "height of the age of mammals"{{r|normark}} and McKenna's analysis of historical events has been criticised for having a [[eurocentric]] and [[cultural bias]].&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt;&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt;

====The Watkins Objection====
The British mathematician Matthew Watkins of [[Exeter University]] conducted a mathematical analysis of the ''Time Wave'', and claimed there were various mathematical flaws in its construction.&lt;ref name=shroom /&gt;

==Critical reception==
One expert on drug treatment attacked McKenna for popularizing "dangerous substances". Judy Corman, vice president of Phoenix House of New York, a drug treatment center, said in a letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1993: "Surely the fact that Terence McKenna says that the psilocybin mushroom 'is the megaphone used by an alien, intergalactic Other to communicate with mankind' is enough for us to wonder if taking LSD has done something to his mental faculties."&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"/&gt;

"I suffered hallucinatory agonies of my own while reading his shrilly ecstatic prose," Peter Conrad wrote in ''The New York Times'' in a 1993 review of Mr. McKenna's book ''True Hallucinations''.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"/&gt;

Biologist [[Richard Evans Schultes]], of [[Harvard University]], wrote in ''[[American Scientist]]'' in a 1993 review of McKenna's book ''Food of the Gods'', that it was; "a masterpiece of research and writing" and that it "should be read by every specialist working in the multifarious fields involved with the use of psychoactive drugs." Concluding that "It is, without question, destined to play a major role in our future considerations of the role of the ancient use of psychoactive drugs, the historical shaping of our modern concerns about drugs and perhaps about man's desire for escape from reality with drugs."&lt;ref name="American scientist food of the gods review"&gt;{{cite news |last= Schultes |first= Richard Evans |authorlink= Richard Evans Schultes |title= Food of the Gods: The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge by Terence McKenna |department= Life Sciences |type= Book review |magazine= [[American Scientist]] |year= 1993 |volume= 81 |issue= 5 |pages= 489–90 |jstor= 29775027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]] in a 2012 blog post for ''[[Scientific American]]'' also commented that, ''Food of the Gods'' was "a rigorous argument...that mind-expanding plants and fungi catalyzed the transformation of our brutish ancestors into cultured modern humans."&lt;ref name=ScientificAHorgan /&gt;

"To write him off as a crazy hippie is a rather lazy approach to a man not only full of fascinating ideas but also blessed with a sense of humor and self-parody," Tom Hodgkinson wrote in ''The New Statesman and Society'' in 1994.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"/&gt;

Mark Jacobson said of ''True Hallucinations'', in a 1992 issue of ''[[Esquire Magazine]]'' that, "it would be hard to find a drug narrative more compellingly perched on a baroquely romantic limb than this passionate Tom-and-Huck-ride-great-mother-river-saga of brotherly bonding," adding "put simply, Terence is a hoot!"&lt;ref name=EsquireJacobson /&gt;

''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' called him a "charismatic talking head" who was "brainy, eloquent, and hilarious"&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt; and [[Jerry Garcia]] of the [[Grateful Dead]] also said that he was "the only person who has made a serious effort to objectify the psychedelic experience."&lt;ref name= "NYT Obit"/&gt;

==Notes==
* {{Note label|A|a|a}} Most Mayanist scholars, such as Mark Van Stone and Anthony Aveni, adhere to the "GMT (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson) correlation" with the Long Count, which places the start date at 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC and the end date of b'ak'tun 13 at December 21, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Who's Who in the Classic Maya World |publisher= Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies |url= http://research.famsi.org/whos_who/christian_dates.htm |authorlink= Peter Mathews (archaeologist) |first= Peter |last= Matthews |year= 2005 |accessdate= 2011-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This date was also the overwhelming preference of those who believed in 2012 eschatology, arguably, Van Stone suggests, because it was a solstice, and was thus astrologically significant. Some Mayanist scholars, such as Michael D. Coe, Linda Schele and [[Marc Zender]], adhere to the "Lounsbury/GMT+2" correlation, which sets the start date at August 13 and the end date at December 23. Which of these is the precise correlation has yet to be conclusively settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Questions and comments |first= Mark |last= Van Stone |publisher= Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies |website= famsi.org |url= http://www.famsi.org/research/vanstone/2012/comments.html |accessdate= 2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coe's initial date was "24 December 2011." He revised it to "11 January AD 2013" in the 1980 2nd edition of his book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Coe |first= Michael D. |year= 1980 |title= The Maya |series= Ancient Peoples and Places |volume= 10 |edition= 2nd |location= London |publisher= Thames and Hudson |page= 151 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; not settling on December 23, 2012 until the 1984 3rd edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Coe |first= Michael D. |year= 1984 |title= The Maya |series= Ancient Peoples and Places |edition= 3rd |location= London |publisher= Thames and Hudson |isbn= |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation of b'ak'tun 13 as December 21, 2012 first appeared in Table B.2 of [[Robert J. Sharer]]'s 1983 revision of the 4th edition of [[Sylvanus Morley]]'s book ''The Ancient Maya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Morley |first= Sylvanus |year= 1983 |title= The Ancient Maya |edition= 4th |location= Palo Alto, CA |publisher= Stanford University Press |page= 603, Table B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Note label|B|b|b}} The 1975 first edition of McKenna's ''The Invisible Landscape'' refers to 2012 (but no specific day during the year) only twice. In the 1993 second edition, McKenna employed December 21, 2012 throughout, the date arrived at by the [[Mayanist]] researcher [[Robert J. Sharer]].&lt;ref name="skepsis"/&gt;

'''''The Jewish Chronicle of Pittsburgh''''' is a weekly newspaper published every Thursday for the Jewish community in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], USA, and the surrounding area. The newspaper is owned and distributed by the [[Jewish Publication and Education Foundation]]. The founding executive editor of the Jewish Chronicle in 1962 was Albert W. Bloom, then a reporter and science editor of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette. Bloom wrote the editorials and a weekly column "People and Issues" for over 20 years. Under Bloom's leadership, the paper became one of the leading Jewish papers in the US, and ran a number of prize winning series. Bloom continued as editor until his retirement in 1983, when he also served as President of the American Jewish Press Association. 

Joel Roteman succeeded Bloom and edited the paper from 1983. 

Because Pittsburgh has a relatively large population of Jews, especially in [[Squirrel Hill]], the publication has a higher circulation than most other local Jewish newspapers. The Chronicle reports on news occurring in the local Jewish community and city as a whole as well as national and global news that is of Jewish interest, especially news related to Israel. It also extensively covers Jewish news in West Virginia, and is believed to be the only Jewish publication to pay consistent attention to Jewish activities in that state. The newspaper has a religious column called the Portion of the Week, usually written by a local [[rabbi]] or religious leader. Other features include advertisements, letters to the editors, and a calendar of upcoming community events.

The modern Reform [[Hazzan|Cantorate]] is seen as a result of developments that took place during the 19th century, largely in Europe. The process continued to evolve in America following the emigration of German Reform Jews towards the end of the century.

==Emancipation==
We may attribute these events to a new dialectic obtaining between Jews who saw themselves as reformers and the views held at the time by the majority of Jews in the world. Although a [[Haskalah|modernist tendency]] was already present within European Jewish thought, the [[French Revolution]] and its aftermath gave [[Jewish emancipation|free rein]] to those who wished to remake Judaism based on the new relationship Judaism had with Western society.

==Revision of the service==
The novel experience of life "as citizens" was for Jews, as if a mirror had been cast in front of them. They appraised themselves in relation to non-Jews as they never had before and felt the need to accommodate the new situation in religious as well as in civic life.
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...ancient [[Jewish services|Jewish ritual practices]] stood in pale contrast to the enlightened modern church. The church offered participatory rites punctuated by the singing of moving hymns by the congregation and impressive performances by professional choirs singing the glorious music of Bach and Mozart—complete with stirring instrumental accompaniments. The synagogue offered unaccompanied Eastern chants known only to a limited inner circle of ''chazzanim'', recited in an antique, literally backward and virtually incomprehensible language. How could Judaism hope to compete on such a stage? The only possible answer was to reformulate Judaism to suit the sensibilities of the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Edelman|2003|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The model for change tended to be the relatively staid Protestant service. The Orthodox service, previously marked by its fervor, slowly changed into a "modern" synagogue ritual in an attempt to achieve the decorum that was thought to go with recognition by the state. Many aspects of the way in which prayer was rendered (and therefore the music) changed rapidly. "Unsuitable traditional singing which interrupts the prayer" was curtailed, and congregants were "reminded and ordered to follow the cantor's prayers quietly and silently"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Petuchowski|1968}}, cited by {{harvp|Slobin|2002|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than rabbis, the first figures to make and attempt reform were laymen. The first successful reformer of synagogue ritual was [[Israel Jacobson]] (1768–1822), a wealthy and influential merchant. His goal was to reform ritual as well as religious education of the [[Jews in Germany]]. In [[Seesen]] (in [[Lower Saxony]]) in 1810, he erected the first Reform temple on the grounds of a boys' school. Many innovations were based on the Christian model. The temple had a bell used to announce the time of prayer. For the first time sermons were delivered in German. Jacobson was the first to introduce confirmation.

==Overturning the traditional musical style==
As well as taking responsibility for re-arranging the ritual, the music was also changed. Jacobson installed an organ. A children's service was set, into which he introduced hymns that used tunes from Protestant chorales. The chanting of the Pentateuch and Prophets and prayers according to traditional modes were discarded. The service was read without chant, meaning that there was no longer the need for a ''chazzan'';&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Idelsohn|1992|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least not a ''chazzan'' who could only function in the traditional capacity.
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Not only were congregants quieted, but also the high and low voiced singers who used to accompany the ''chazzan'' were replaced by decorous choruses as change spread across the German lands community by community throughout the first half of the nineteenth century. Hymns in German replaced the old [[piyyut|piyutim]], [liturgical poems] which began to be curtailed or proscribed altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lowenstein|1981}}, cited by {{harvp|Slobin|2002|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The pioneer of Jewish musicology [[Abraham Zevi Idelsohn|A. Z. Idelsohn]] (1882–1938) observes that as long as Jews lived in the belief that their stay in the Diaspora was compulsory galut (exile), as long as it was necessary to hope for a return to Palestine, they instinctively preserved the Semitic-Oriental element in themselves and in their cultural creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Idelsohn|1992|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, this self-assessment was altered by their self-appraisal as 'citizens' of a nation. The Reform usage of the term '[[temple#Jewish synagogues and temples|temple]]' for their places of worship (rather than '[[synagogue]]') was intended to convey a renunciation of any desire to rebuild the Temple of Jerusalem; one of the crucial events anticipated by those who envisioned the inevitable return of the Jews to the Levant. Since it was no longer necessary to engender this hope via stylistic elements in their music, Western European melodic and harmonic techniques could be embraced without constraint. Idelsohn explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Rather than abandon Judaism altogether it was thought to] reform their Judaism, by which they meant to cut away exotic, Semitic-Oriental parts, and retain only that part of Judaism which was of a general religious and ethical nature. The idea was so to remodel Judaism that it should not be a stumbling block by reason of its [[Orientalism]] and [[Medieval music|medievalism]], that it should be as easy to observe as is Christianity, that, furthermore, the modern Jew should not be offended by its strangeness and should be attracted by its European exterior.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Idelsohn|1992|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But there was a limit to the amount of change the even a liberal congregation would accept. In Berlin, [[Jacob Herz Beer]] (1769–1825) a banker and sugar manufacturer,&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelmy-Dollinger, Petra. [http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/berlin-salons-late-eighteenth-to-early-twentieth-century "Berlin Salons: Late Eighteenth to Early Twentieth Century."] Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia. 1 March 2009. Jewish Women's Archive. November 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the father of the composer [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]] (1791–1864) opened a temple in his home according to Jacobson's program. His son (who happened to oppose the use of the organ in Jewish services—see below) arranged the music. But from the beginning, Beer was constrained to engage a ''chazzan'' in order to attract a greater audience. Back in Seer, Jacobson also acquiesced to public demand and engaged ''Chazzan'' Hirsch Goldberg (1807–1893). Together with [[Julius Freudenthal]] (1805–1874) (his famous tune to Ein Keloheinu is still sung today) they modernized synagogue song eventually publishing a collection of solos and two-part choir arrangements.

==From ''Chazzan'' to Cantor==
At this point, the new Reform model retained the ''chazzan's'' title, but he was beginning to be valued less for his abilities as a soloist and more for his skill in either composing new works or arranging old melodies for the congregation to sing. The new arrangements may have required solo from the ''chazzan'', but it was no longer requisite to sing long solos (or even have a particularly good voice!) in order to be effective. Things were becoming more 'democratic' with regard to who did the singing, but rather than threatening the role of the cantor, this trend enhanced it, because the new responsibilities of composer, arranger, and conductor required conservatory training.

The first of the great cantor-composers were Salomon Sulzer, Samuel Naumbourg, and Louis Lewandowski, who held posts in Vienna, Paris, and Berlin, respectively. They created melodies that are today considered 'traditional' in synagogues, temples, and even little ''shteiblachs'' of every variety. Their arrangements are still required study for student cantors and continue to be sung by choirs of all levels. Their profiles and achievements are well-documented elsewhere. Here we will deal with a single issue or event, seemingly unimportant in relation to the rest of their work, but having considerable impact on the Reform cantorate or music in Reform temples.

===Salomon Sulzer's advocacy of the organ===
[[Salomon Sulzer]] (1808–1890) was the legendary ''oberkantor'' ('chief cantor') of Vienna. He was the first to consciously devise this role (and the title), basing it on the example of [[J.S. Bach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Slobin|2002|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is revered as an innovative composer, a singer of marvelous range and expression (a tenor/baritone) and as a prominent teacher, having been a member of the Vienna Conservatory faculty. His compositions combined 'old' and 'new' by setting traditional melodies in arrangement for four-part chorus, influencing the musical style of many synagogues in Eastern and Central Europe.  Sulzer's main contributions to synagogue music did not take place as a part of Radical Reform Judaism in Germany, but rather in the context of the Viennese Rite, which was more akin ideologically to the Neologue Synagogues of Hungary and the teachings of Zecharias Frankel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wohlberg|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulzer took a progressive position on the renewal of vocal music in the synagogue, however he opposed the use of the German language in the Jewish service, and initially the use of organ,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ringer|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his view won out. Though often erroneously referred to as Reform, the Vienna Stadttemple was, in fact, more akin to a contemporary modern Orthodox synagogue.  Max Wohlberg wrote, “The Jews of Vienna eschewed the rationalistic and universalistic ideas of extreme Reform and preferred the milder nationalistic and historic views that were later crystallized by Leopold Zunz, Abraham Geiger, Zechariah Frankel, and even Samson Raphael Hirsch.”   The service was officiated strictly by men, and women sat separately.  Although some piyyutim were removed, and a few prayers added in the vernacular, the liturgy was, for the most part, the traditional liturgy, (as opposed to the liturgy of radical Reform) as evidenced by Sulzer’s primary notated musical compendia, Shir Zion (published between 1840 and 1866).  The choir of Sulzer’s time consisted strictly of men and boys.  Though there were optional organ accompaniments in many of the pieces, the organ was not used during services on the Sabbath and Holidays.  Vienna was then the music capital of the world and even ''chazzanim'' from Orthodox Eastern Europe came to Vienna in order to learn something of the new style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frühauf|2004|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singing and choirs were introduced without much controversy, but when it came to the [[Organ (music)|organ]], synagogues were more hesitant, even negative. Meyerbeer, (noted above) when he was asked to compose a work for the consecration of the new Jewish house of worship in Vienna, once made the following comment on music in the synagogue: &lt;blockquote&gt;You are not about to introduce an organ into the synagogue! That is a purely Christian instrument. What next! ...The human being in prayer should speak to his god without any intermediary. This is what the Jews have done since the destruction of the Temple; it has been the custom for two millennia. We should make no innovations. But if they are determined to have different music, it should in my opinion, be music from trombones and flutes, like those that resounded in the Temple of Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;Foyer (Leipzig: 1898), in Max Grunwald, ''Der Kampf um die Orgel in der Wiener Israelitischen Kultusgemeinde.'' (Vienna: Verlag von Dr. Bloch's Volkenshrift, 1919), p. 17. Cited in {{harvp|Frühauf|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The first Jewish synod at Leipzig, in June 1869, brought together rabbis and community leaders from all over Europe, the United States, and even the West Indies to discuss the ideas of "enlightened" and liberal Judaism. Salomon Sulzer was a deputy in the synod; the sole representative of cantors and synagogue musicians—testifying to the high regard the body of liberal rabbis held for this cantor and their understanding that music was a critical element in the 'liberal' congregations they envisioned. In his address, Sulzer brought up the issue of the organ.&lt;blockquote&gt;An instrumental accompaniment of the singing during the worship service [should] be introduced everywhere, in order to make it easier for the members of the congregation to take an active part in the same. ...the organ is worthy of recommendation for the required accompaniment, and there are no religious objections to its us on the Sabbath and on holidays.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon Sulzer, motion. Summarized in ''Verhandlungen der ersten Israelitischen Synode zu Leipzig'' (Berlin: 1969), pp. 250f. Cited in {{harvp|Frühauf|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Synod agreed; no objections were raised to its use on the Shabbat and on holidays, in turn recommending that introduction of the organ proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frühauf|2004|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulzer emphasizes the solo role of the organ; its necessity over and above that of other instruments:&lt;blockquote&gt;Only the organ is capable of leading the congregations in song, regulating it, masking dissonances; and it should properly be reintroduced into the space that was denied it for all too long in public worship, to the detriment of religious edification The organ makes the priestly office of the chazzan independent of the latter's artistry, and yet saves him from the type of egotistical pseudo-artistry that falls upon the seed of the aesthetically beautiful like mildew and poisons it; it preserves him from the use of those trivial decorative vocal flourishes that provincial cantors use and abuse to appeal to the masses, or the sentimental Polish virtuosity that drives the younger generation, which is generally musically educated, to flee the house of the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon Sulzer, "Denkschrift an die...Weiner Cultus-Gemeinde", (Vienna: 1876), cited in Avenar, ed., ' 'Kantor Salomon Sulzer und seine Zeit,' ' pp. 172f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Samuel Naumbourg and composers outside of the synagogue===
[[Samuel Naumbourg]] (1817–1880) was descended from ten generations of ''chazzanim''. He grew up in the world of Southern Ashkenazic ''chazzanut'', and was with musicality and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Idelsohn|1992|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; His was trained in Munich, but his city would be Paris; the major European capital perhaps best distinguished by the significant role influence plays behind the scenes when it comes to music-making.

Naumbourg arrived in Paris in 1843 and began a friendship with [[Fromental Halévy|Jacques Fromental Halévy]], to whom he had been recommended. Naumbourg pursued the position of director of music at the synagogue in rue Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth, a community that had not had chazzan since the death of [[Israel Lovey]] in 1832 and the service was in disarray. Anything he proposed however, would have to pass through government's Department of Cults and Education. He submitted an application for the post, which was well-received due in part to favorable endorsement of Halévy:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Idelsohn|1992|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I was able to form an opinion of his musical studies, and read his compositions. I am of the opinion that he is most suitable to be called to the important position now vacant and that he is capable of elevating it to the height of its true aim. He is keen, motivated by a desire to do well, and should give the organization good musical service, talent, and commitment.&lt;ref&gt;J.F.Halévy,"Letter to the Jewish Consistory" in Jordan, R. ''Fromental Halévy: His Life and Music.'' New York: Proscenium. 1989. p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; On his appointment Naumbourg immediately began compiling an anthology of traditional liturgical songs.

His great innovation was to include, for the first time songs for soloists and choir commissioned from professional composers. Among the hundreds for traditional ones published in the first two volumes of his ''Zemirot Yisrael'' in 1847 and the third volume published in 1865 under the subtitle ''Shirei Kodesh'' there were two or three by [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]] né Morhange (1813–1888), one by Meyerbeer, and several by Halévy. His 1874 anthology ''Aggudat Shirim'' posthumously included three more Halévy settings.

===How Louis Lewandowski got hired===
The story of the rise of [[Louis Lewandowski]] (1821–1894) illustrates the struggle between the 'old guard' and the 'new guard'.

Eventually, the innovations of Jacob Beer in Berlin were curtailed by the government's forced closure of his synagogue. This led to a conservative reaction on the part of the Jewish Community in Berlin, and the appointment of one Asher Lion (1776–1863) as the ''chazzan'' of the Reform temple. Lion re-introduced the old 18th-century chazzanut. This 'restoration' would seem to have effectively discredited Beer's 'adventurism'. Although the hackneyed style Lion proffered continued to predominate until about the middle of the century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Idelsohn|1992|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; his appointment to Berlin Synagogue would ultimately ensure the emergence of the modern cantorate.

At the age of 12, Lewandowski was sent to Berlin to study at the conservatory where he was expected to become 'the Jewish [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]].' He became a ''singerl'' (lit."little singer"; a child who appeared as a featured soloist or in duets with the ''chazzan''). Lewandowski had no desire to follow Lion into Jewish music until he came under the sway of Hirsch Weintraub (1817–1881) an itinerant synagogue musician. His compositions were some of the first to effectively combine the best of gentile musicianship with traditional oriental elements. The music, consisting of arrangements for choir and string quartets, had a profound Jewish feeling but was rendered in a very sophisticated style. Much of it was based on the best of [[Mozart]] and [[Haydn]]. Some of the latter's string quartets, for example, were arranged to be sung by Weintraub's choir. This impressed Lewandowski (who had previously rejected the possibility of fusing these two seemingly contrary styles) along with the rest of the Berlin audiences who attended the performances on Weintraub's tour. Lewandowski began writing in the style he would eventually master.

Asher Lion, meanwhile, was forced to come to terms with this sudden evolution in the taste of the Berlin community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Idelsohn|1992|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; But because Lion was virtually untrained in modern composition, he could not read choir parts. After trying different ruses to obtain some understanding of the 'new music', he attempted to cajole Weintraub's quartet to join him and thereby obtain the music. He succeeded in enlisting the tenor, but it turned out that the tenor only knew his own parts! Lion was informed by this same tenor, that Weintraub actually utilized the scores of Sulzer, which were at the time still in manuscript.

Under the assumption that a Sulzer manuscript would be impossible to obtain, he demanded just that from his synagogue committee. When they actually managed to ''get one'' and present it to him, a real crisis ensued. Sulzer wrote using a different clef for each part! Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass. In desperation Lion eventually turned to the young Lewandowski to help him decipher the notes, finally just giving him the job of directing the choir. Lion realized that Lewandowski was indispensable to him and eventually Lewandowski's position as 'Choir Master' was made permanent—the first time that this title was recognized in synagogue setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Idelsohn|1992|pp=273–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==America==

Until the 19th century the roles of the ''chazzanim'' in America were similar to the ones they played in the old world during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance; they served as ''shochtim'', ''mohelim'', and as religious schoolteachers. Their primary duties were not musical, although they presided at marriages and burials and chanted the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Edelman|2003|pp=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There were no ordained Rabbis in the United States until the 1840s when the first major wave of German Jews arrived. Of course they brought with them the reforms that had been initiated in Europe, along with the nascent musical forms. At first, the choir director and the organ had more of an influence on the services than the ''chazzan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Edelman|2003|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-century, the situation resembled the one that prevailed in Europe. As in the services being held in Germany and France, the Hebrew texts were abbreviated, many of the prayers were in the national tongue—English. There was an organ and the traditional chanting had been replaced by congregational singing of a mixed choir.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Idelsohn|1992|pp=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have been impossible for a traditionally-trained ''chazzan'' to lead a Reform service. [[Isaac Mayer Wise]] (1819–1900) a founder of the Reform Movement in America, described the old-time ''chazzan'' as 'half priest, half beggar, half oracle, half fool, as the occasion demanded.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Slobin|2002|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to re-establish a pivotal role for the ''chazzan'' was [[Alois Kaiser]] (1840–1908) Kaiser had been a member of Sulzer's choir as a boy, had conservatory training, and had served as a Cantor in the suburbs of Vienna. Beginning in 1866 he served at the congregation [[Oheib Shalom]] in Baltimore. He introduced classical compositions and operatic arias to be used as melodies, and wrote his own compositions in a similar style.

In general, the shortened service, the choir, and the organ made a cantor unnecessary, 'but if a musical leader came along who know how to reshape and revitalize the service, the laity might be swayed by his personality'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heller|1942|pp=167–168}}, cited by {{harvp|Silverstein|1994|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1894, Temple Sinai of New Orleans hired the Hungarian-born Cantor [[Julius Braunfeld]].... Cincinnati's K.K. B'nai Yeshurun, which had abolished the traditional office of 'Reader'... ...decided to reverse itself by seeking to employ not an old style ''chazzan'' but a contemporary Reform style cantor.&lt;ref name="Silverstein"&gt;{{harvp|Silverstein|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note the use of the title 'Cantor'. This of course, was the title first used by Salomon Sulzer; Sulzer remained the ideal of what a Cantor ought to be. His Austrian, Hungarian, and German disciples within the American Reform ambiance created a distinctive niche for the temple cantor.&lt;ref name="Silverstein"/&gt;

===Edward Stark===
Cantor Edward Stark (1856–1913) was one of these disciples. Stark served San Francisco's Emanu-El from 1893 through the following two decades. Stark's father, Cantor Joseph Stark, had trained in Vienna with Sulzer and transmitted the legacy to his son. On the West Coast, Edward Stark (1856–1913) proceeded in much the same way. He and his congregations expected excellent performances from the non-Jewish singers hired for the choir. He supplemented his own work with the new compositions of Sulzer. Like the European synagogue masters, he adapted music of Haydn, [[Gounod]], [[Schubert]], and Mendelssohn, as well as anthems from the [[Hymnology|Protestant tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Silverstein|1994|pp=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulzer's works were frequently included in services conducted by American Cantors at this time, along with works of their own. The prominence that music had, and the combination of the cantor's solo work, the choral numbers, and congregational singing, made the services at Reform temples unique within the American Jewish scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zucker|1985}}, cited by {{harvp|Silverstein|1994|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is Cantor Stark's job description as it appeared in the "Bylaws of the Congregation Emanu-El"

&lt;blockquote&gt;Article II. Duties of the Cantor. Section I. The Cantor shall be present on all occasions of divine service at the proper time. Section 2. He shall attend all funerals and read the service at the house of mourning at the request of the family. Section 3. He shall be assigned a class in the Religious School as teacher, by the Superintendent and School Committee. Section 4. He shall be director of the choir and perform such other duties that the Board of directors may prescribe.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution and By-Laws of Congregation Emanu El.'' see Rosenbaum, F. ''Architects for Reform: Congregational and Community Leadership, Emanu-El of San Francisco, 1849–1980.'' Berkeley, CA. 1980. (Cited by {{harvp|Silverstein|1994|p=105}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All for $4,500 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Silverstein|1994|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A Hymnal===
The creation of the [[Society of American Cantors]] in 1897 was partly in order to facilitate the composition of a hymnal for the [[UAHC]] (Union of American Hebrew Congregations).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Silverstein|1994|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''[[Union Hymnal]]'' (1897) they created featured abundant hymns, English translations of Hebrew prayers, adaptations of Protestant "favorites", and rearrangements of European classical music used as settings. The [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] endorsed its use in 1903 "so that it may in reality become what it was intended to be, a bond of union for all congregations throughout the land."&lt;ref&gt;''Yearbook of the Central Conference of American Rabbis Vol. XIII'' Baltimore: Friedenwald. 1904. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the cantor in the Reform movement had entirely changed in the hundred years since Israel Jacobson founded his school in Seesen. Though the cantor's relationship to the new synagogue had been tenuous—at times eliminated altogether—CCAR's endorsement of the ''Union Hymnal'' also endorsed the role of the modern cantor: a trained musician familiar with Jewish tradition and sensitive to the needs of his community.

{{Buddhism}}
'''Theodorus''' ({{lang-el|Θεόδωρος}}) was a "[[meridarch]]" (Civil Governor of a province) in the [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]] province of the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] in the northern [[Indian subcontinent]], probably sometime between 100 BCE and the end of Greek rule in Gandhara in 55 BCE.

He is only known from a dedication written in [[kharoshthi]] on a relic vase inserted in a [[stupa]] in the Swat area of [[Gandhara]], dated to the 1st century BCE (line-for-line translation):

==Description==
:''"Theudorena meridarkhena
:''pratithavida
:''ime sarira
:''Sakamunisa [[bhagavat]]o
:''bahu-jana-stitiye"''

:"The meridarch Theodorus
:has enshrined
:these relics
:of Lord [[Shakyamuni]],
:for the welfare of the mass of the people"

:(Swāt relic vase inscription of the Meridarkh Theodoros [http://depts.washington.edu/ebmp/etext.php?cki=CKI0032])

This inscription represents one of the first known mention of the Buddha as a deity, using the Indian [[bhakti]] word [[Bhagavat]] ("Lord", "All-embracing personal deity"), suggesting the emergence of [[Mahayana]] doctrines in [[Buddhism]].

It is also one of the examples of direct involvement of the Greeks with the Buddhist religion in India.

Theodorus is considered as contemporary or slightly posterior to another Indo-Greek named Heliodorus, whose c.100 BCE inscriptions have been preserved in the [[Heliodorus pillar]].

The '''Theosophical Society in America''' (TSA) is a member-based nonprofit organization dedicated to the teaching of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and affiliated with the international [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society based in Adyar]], [[Chennai]], India. The name "Theosophical Society in America" was legally adopted by the American Theosophical Society in 1934.&lt;ref name="Anonymous 1934"&gt;Anonymous, "The Name That Is Ours," ''The American Theosophist'' 22 no. 9 (September 1934): 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, other organizations had used the same name during the years 1895–98 and 1898–1908.

== Philosophy ==
The Theosophical Society is composed of individuals united by their concurrence with its three Objects, by their dedication to promoting brotherhood, and by their interest in study and spiritual self-transformation. Theosophists consider that belief should be the result of individual study, experience, and insight, rather than reliance on dogma. They see each religion as an expression of Divine Wisdom, adapted to the needs of a particular time and place. Theosophy regards the universe as alive and interrelated, with an intelligent order guiding the cyclical evolution of all life. The Theosophical Society supports the right of individual freedom of thought for every person, and no doctrine is in any way binding on any member of the Society&lt;ref&gt;Theosophical Society in America, "Introduction," Theosophical Society in America, http://www.theosophical.org/about-us (accessed 19 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objects ==
The three declared Objects of the Theosophical Society are:
*  To form a nucleus of the universal brotherhood of humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or color.
*  To encourage the comparative study of religion, philosophy, and science.
*  To investigate unexplained laws of nature and the powers latent in humanity&lt;ref&gt;Theosophical Society in America, "Introduction," Theosophical Society in America, http://www.theosophical.org/about-us/the-society/3-objects (accessed 19 August 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission statement ==
The Theosophical Society in America encourages open-minded inquiry into world religions, philosophy, science, and the arts in order to understand the wisdom of the ages, respect the unity of all life, and help people explore spiritual self-transformation&lt;ref&gt;Theosophical Society in America, "Mission Statement," Theosophical Society in America, http://www.theosophical.org/about-us/1044 (accessed 19 August 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Russian [[Helena Blavatsky]] and American Colonel [[Henry Steel Olcott]] founded the [[Theosophical Society]] with attorney [[William Quan Judge]] and others in late 1875 in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gomes, ''Dawning of the Theosophical Movement'' (Wheaton, Ill: Theosophical Publishing House, 1987):  86-89.&lt;/ref&gt;  After its two major co-founders departed for India in 1879 to establish the international headquarters of the Society in [[Adyar (Tamil Nadu)|Adyar]], India (near [[Madras]], now known as [[Chennai]]), young Mr. Judge carried on the work of advancing interest in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] within the United States. By 1886 he had established an American Section of the international Society with branches in fourteen cities. Rapid growth took place under his guidance, so that by 1895 there were 102 American branches with nearly six thousand members.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce F. Campbell, ''Ancient Wisdom Revived: A History of the Theosophical Movement'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980), 104.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Madame Blavatsky died in 1891, leaving Colonel Olcott and English social activist [[Annie Besant]] as the principal leaders of the international movement based in Adyar, and [[William Quan Judge]] heading the American Section.

During the contentious Ninth Annual Convention of the American Section in 1895, eighty-three lodges voted for autonomy from the international [[Theosophical Society Adyar]]. The international President-Founder, Colonel Olcott, interpreted this action as secession, and revoked the charters of those lodges, whose members reorganized into the first '''“Theosophical Society in America”''' under [[William Quan Judge]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 111.&lt;/ref&gt;  After Judge's death the following year, [[Katherine Tingley]] stepped into the leadership of that organization, and in 1898 folded the Theosophical Society in America into the Universal Brotherhood, resulting in the Universal Brotherhood and Theosophical Society.&lt;ref&gt;Grace F. Knoche, "Katherine Tingley: A Biographical Sketch," ''Sunrise'' 47 no. 4 (April/May 1998), available online at http://www.theosophy-nw.org/theosnw/theos/th-ktgk1.htm (accessed 12 November 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Michael Ashcraft, ''The Dawn of the New Cycle'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2002), 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt; After several changes in location and name, the successor organization is now known as the [[Theosophical Society Pasadena]]. Other groups split off from Tingley's organization over the years, becoming [[Theosophical Society in America (Hargrove)]] the [[Theosophical Society of New York]], the [[United Lodge of Theosophists]], and [[Temple of the People]] in Halcyon, California.&lt;ref&gt;Curuppumallage Jinarajadasa, ''The Golden Book of the Theosophical Society: a Brief History of the Society's Growth from 1875-1955'' (Adyar, Madras, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The second '''“Theosophical Society in America”''' headed by Ernest Temple Hargrove dropped the words "in America" from its name in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, "T. S. Activities," ''Theosophical Quarterly'' 6 no. 1 (July, 1908): 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five American lodges that had opposed the 1895 secession retained their affiliation with the international Society in Adyar. They formed a new American Section known as the American Theosophical Society under the leadership of Alexander Fullerton.&lt;ref name="Joy Mills 1987"&gt;Joy Mills, ''100 Years of Theosophy: A History of the Theosophical Society in America'' (Wheaton, Ill.: Theosophical Publishing House, 1987), 27-29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Extensive lecture tours by [[Annie Besant]] and [[Constance Wachtmeister]] elicited much new interest in the American Theosophical Society,&lt;ref name="Joy Mills 1987"/&gt;  so that by 1900 the organization claimed 1286 members and 71 branches.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to clarify the complex history of the Theosophical movement in the United States, Dorothy Bell has created a diagram along the lines of a family tree, which can be viewed at '''American Family Tree of Theosophy''' [http://www.theosophical.org/files/about/FamilyTreeTheosophy.pdf]. See also [[Theosophical Society in America#Other Theosophical societies in the United States|Other Theosophical societies in the United States]] below.

The American Theosophical Society was legally renamed '''"The Theosophical Society in America"''' in 1934, and has existed under that name ever since.&lt;ref name="Anonymous 1934"/&gt;  Like other Theosophical groups, the organization aspires to educate the public about the principles of Theosophy through publications, public programs, and local group activities. A video of Society history may be viewed at [http://www.theosophical.org/about-us].

== Organization ==
The modern '''Theosophical Society in America''' is a member-based not-for-profit corporation. It is incorporated in the state of Illinois with federal 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. The national headquarters has been located in [[Wheaton, Illinois]] since 1927. About 115 local groups include branches (also called lodges) and smaller study centers. As of 2008, the membership comprised about 4000 people.

== Leadership ==

The TSA is governed by a Board of Directors that meets at the national headquarters. Officers include a president, vice president, national treasurer, and national secretary. Two directors are elected by members from each of three geographical districts in the United States.

The national president also has the title of General Secretary for the American section of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]] based in Chennai, India, and participates in the General Council that governs the international Society. These are the presidents since the 1895 reorganization of the American Society:

== National headquarters ==

Under Alexander Fullerton, the American Theosophical Society (now known as Theosophical Society in America) was based in New York City, but his successor, Dr. Weller van Hook, moved the headquarters to Chicago in 1907. A. P. Warrington transferred operations to Hollywood in 1912, where the Theosophical colony of [[Krotona]] was established. Most of the colony later moved north to [[Ojai, California]], while the headquarters returned to Chicago in 1920.

During his presidency, L. W. Rogers sought to establish a permanent headquarters in a central and accessible location. He led a search for land where a new headquarters could be established. Dozens of sites within {{convert|500|mi|km}} of Chicago were considered before an appropriate property was located in [[Wheaton, Illinois]]. This western suburb of Chicago met all the search criteria in that it was centrally located, with excellent rail transportation, a serene rural atmosphere, and affordable land. In 1925 the Society purchased almost {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of farmland, and immediately began planting a grove of trees.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the recommendation of Theosophist and architect [[Claude Fayette Bragdon]], the Chicago architectural firm of [[Pond and Pond|Pond &amp; Pond, Martin &amp; Lloyd]]  was engaged to design the headquarters building. [[Annie Besant]] laid cornerstone on 29 August 1926 in a ceremony that was attended by [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] and a huge crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Theosophical Society in America, "Laying the Cornerstone," ''The Messenger'' 14 no. 3 (August 1926): 55.\.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1927 staff members moved operations to the new structure, which was eventually named the L. W. Rogers Building.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Gresko, "The Final Touches," ''The Messenger'' no. 25 (November 1998): 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Designed in a collegiate gothic style by [[Pond and Pond|Irving Kane Pond]], the three-story building consists of offices, library, classroom, auditorium, meditation room, kitchen, dining room, garage, and residential wing for staff members and visitors. In 1931 Mrs. C. Shillard-Smith, commissioned painter Richard Blossom Farley to create the colorful mural of evolving life that is still on view in the two-story lobby.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus grew over the years, mostly through donations of land by generous members. In 1932, the headquarters estate came to be known as [[Olcott Estate|"Olcott"]], in honor of co-founder Colonel [[Henry Steel Olcott]].&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 104-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  For several decades, postal mail was delivered simply to "Olcott, Wheaton, Illinois." The property now comprises almost {{convert|42|acre|m2}}. The Quest Book Shop and Theosophical Publishing House are housed in the Mills Building, named after president Joy Mills. The scenic grounds are open to the public, and feature a pond, groves, gardens, and a labyrinth. Video tours of the campus are available [http://www.theosophical.org/about-us/the-society/national-center/1156].

== National library and archives ==

Books and periodicals have always been extremely important to Theosophists as tools for study. In 1922, L. W. Rogers established the national library,&lt;ref&gt;L. W. Rogers, “A National Theosophical Library,” ''The Messenger'' 11 no. 4 (September 1923): 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  and when the headquarters building was constructed in Wheaton a two-story library was incorporated into the design. The original space was expanded in 1962-63 to add offices, meeting rooms, stacks, and basement storage.&lt;ref&gt;Joy Mills, “Library Addition at Olcott,” ''The American Theosophist'' 50 no. 6 (June 1962): 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Henry S. Olcott Memorial Library''' houses books, periodicals, pamphlets, microfilm, videos, and audio recordings. The collection focuses on Theosophy, religion, science, philosophy, art, biography, and health. The reading room is open to the public six days each week; members of the Society and other library patrons can borrow library materials by mail or in person. The library belongs to the DuPage Library System MAGIC consortium and the [[American Theological Library Association]], and works in close cooperation with the Emily Sellon Memorial Library at the New York Theosophical Society, and the Krotona Library in Ojai, California.&lt;ref&gt;Theosophical Society in America, “Henry S. Olcott Memorial Library,” Theosophical Society in America, http://www.theosophical.org/library (accessed 19 August 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Archival collections include organizational records, and also special collections of papers from [[Boris de Zirkoff]], Mary K. Neff, Fritz and [[Dora Van Gelder|Dora Kunz]], and others. Records of the American Theosophical movement before 1898 are in the archives of the [[Theosophical Society Pasadena]].

== Activities and programs ==

The national center and local groups offer lectures, study groups, workshops, and other programs to members and the general public. Subject matter is wide-ranging to facilitate the study of comparative religion, philosophy, science, health, and art. Classes have included [[Hatha yoga]], [[qigong]], [[Therapeutic touch]], and many forms of [[meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;Theosophical Society in America, “Programs at National Center,” Theosophical Society in America, http://www.theosophical.org/programs (accessed 19 August 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable speakers at national programs have included the [[14th Dalai Lama]], [[Bede Griffiths]], [[Lama Anagarika Govinda]], [[Ram Dass]], [[Stephan A. Hoeller]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Rupert Sheldrake]], [[Ian Stevenson]], [[Fritjof Capra]], [[Amit Goswami (Physicist)|Amit Goswami]], [[Ravi Ravindra]], and [[Jean Houston]]. The Society has also sponsored regional and national conferences focused on special topics such as education, science, and healing. Hundreds of programs have been recorded or webcast, with many available free online. The '''Theosophical Community''' at [http://theosophical.ning.com/] serves as a means of conducting group discussions and other social networking.

=={{anchor|Publishing}} Publishing==

The Theosophical Society in America has published books, pamphlets, and periodicals since its earliest days. The Theosophical Publishing House publishes books under the '''''Quest Books''''' imprint on a broad array of topics including Theosophy, transpersonal psychology, comparative religion, ecology, spiritual growth, and health.

'''''Quest''''' magazine focuses on philosophy, religion, science, and the arts; articles from some past issues are available online. '''''Messenger''''' is a newsletter for members, providing news of organizational activities and board actions. A free monthly electronic newsletter is distributed by e-mail to members and other interested people. Many of the branch locations, federations, and retreat centers produce their own newsletters and program listings.

== Quest Book Shops ==

Quest Book Shops are commercial enterprises operated by the Theosophical Society in America and its affiliates to sell books, recordings, and other items of interest to students of Theosophy. Locations include shops in Wheaton, Illinois; New York City; Seattle; and Ojai, California.

== Affiliated organizations ==

The [[Theosophical Order of Service]] (TOS) engages in service projects in seven areas:  animal welfare; art and music; ecology; family and children; healing; peace; and social service. [http://www.theoservice.org/]

'''Theosophical Book Gift Institute''' (TBGI) distributes Theosophical books free to libraries and prisoners.

'''Order of the Knights of the Round Table''' sponsors activities for children and adults, and 
'''Young Theosophists''' (YT) is a young adult group.

The '''Krotona Institute of Theosophy''' in [[Ojai, California]], offers classes in Theosophical subjects. [http://www.theosophical.org/membership/local-groups/1110]

Four retreat centers facilitate fellowship and study in serene natural settings:
*  '''Camp Indralaya''' on [[Orcas Island]] in Washington state [http://www.indralaya.com]
*  '''Far Horizons retreat center''' in [[Kings Canyon National Park]] in California [http://www.farhorizons.org/]
*  '''Ozark Theosophical Camp''' in [[Sulphur Springs, Benton County, Arkansas|Sulphur Springs, Arkansas]] [http://www.theosophical.org/membership/local-groups/1126]
*  '''Pumpkin Hollow Retreat Center''' at [[Craryville, New York]] [http://www.pumpkinhollow.org/]

== Other Theosophical societies in the United States ==

The most prominent organizations now supporting study of Theosophy in the United States apart from the Theosophical Society in America are the [[Theosophical Society Pasadena]], and the [[United Lodge of Theosophists]] (ULT), based in Los Angeles. These three organizations have worked together cordially, most notably at the 1993 [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in Chicago. Collaborative efforts at that event included panel discussions and audiovisual productions: ''Ultimate Concerns'', ''Theosophic Worldview'', and ''Inter-Theosophical Dialogue: the Theosophical Movement Past and Future''.

The Pasadena group is composed of sections in nine countries, and offers a library, correspondence courses, study groups, publications, and an extensive array of full-text Theosophical literature on its web page. Members supplement study of the [[Helena Blavatsky]] works with writings by [[William Quan Judge]], [[Katherine Tingley]], [[Gottfried de Purucker]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Theosophical Society, “History of the Theosophical Society,” Theosophical Society, http://www.theosociety.org/ (accessed 13 November 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ULT, founded by [[Robert Crosbie]], is dedicated to the study of the writings of [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[William Quan Judge]] as printed from original plates or from photographic reproductions of original texts. Twenty-two lodges and ten study groups are located in fourteen countries.&lt;ref&gt;United Lodge of Theosophists, “Lodges/Study Groups,” United Lodge of Theosophists, http://www.ult.org/ (accessed 13 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

By way of comparison, the modern Theosophical Society in America bases its studies on Helena Blavatsky, but draws from a broad group of other Theosophical teachers, including [[Annie Besant]], [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]], [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], [[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa]], [[Ernest Wood]], Clara Codd, [[Geoffrey Hodson]], [[Nilakanta Sri Ram]], Joy Mills, [[Radha Burnier]], [[Stephan A. Hoeller]], Robert Ellwood, and John Algeo.

2.[[Dāna|Dana]], the second, means gifts or compensation. Sometimes it is referred to as Dama, price, it means to pay the value. &lt;ref name="idsatext" /&gt; 

3.[[Danda]] refers to force or armaments. To take up war with the opposite state.&lt;ref name="idsatext" /&gt; 

4. Bheda, refers to usage of Logic or Trickery, influence the mind.  &lt;ref name="idsatext" /&gt;

An article on Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses website states that the 20th-century power-politics theoretician Hans J. Morgenthau suggests similar four methods in a struggle for balance of power: Divide and Rule; Compensation; Armaments; and Alliances.&lt;ref name="idsatext" /&gt;

These four approaches are found in the Hindu ''Itihasa'' (epics) and the ''Dharmasastras'', as well as the Jain text ''Nitivakyamitra''.&lt;ref name=idsatext/&gt;

'''Ze’ev Raban''' (1890-1970) was a leading painter, [[decorative art]]ist, and [[industrial designer]] of the [[Bezalel school]] style, and was one of the founders of the [[Israel]]i art world.&lt;ref&gt;''Israeli painting: from post-Impressionism to post-Zionism,'' By Ronald Fuhrer, Overlook Press, 1998, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Zeev raban with the bezalel torah ark.jpg|thumb|Rabam with Bezalel torah ark]]
Wolf Rawicki (later Ze'ev Raban) was born in [[Łódź]], [[Congress Poland]], and began his studies there.  He continued his studies in [[sculpture]] and [[Ornament (architecture)|architectural ornamentation]] at a number of European [[Art school|art academies]].  These included the School of Applied Art in [[Munich]] at the height of the [[Jugendstil]] movement, the [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] studio of [[Marius-Jean-Antonin Mercié]] at the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]], and the [[Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Brussels]], then a center of [[Art Nouveau]], under [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] and [[Idealism (arts)|idealist]] artists [[Victor Rosseau]] and [[Constant Montald]].  
[[Image:Rabanposter.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for the Society for the Promotion of Travel in the Holy Land. 1929 Lithograph]]
Under the influence of [[Boris Schatz]], the founder of the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design|Bezalel Academy]], Raban moved to the [[land of Israel]] in 1912 during the wave of immigration known as the [[Second Aliyah]].  He joined the faculty of the Bezalel school, and soon took on a central role there as a teacher of [[repoussé]], painting, and sculpture.  He also directed the academy's Graphics Press and the Industrial Art Studio.  By 1914, most of the works produced in the school's workshops were of his design. He continued teaching until 1929.&lt;ref name=aatc&gt;[http://www.artatthecenter.com/HTML/Artists.cfm?ID=35 AATC Artists - Ze'ev Raban&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, he participated in the historic art exhibition at the [[Tower of David]], the first exhibit of [[Hebrew]] artists in Palestine, which became the first of a yearly series of such exhibits.

==Works==
Raban is regarded as a leading member of the Bezalel school art style, in which artists portrayed both Biblical and Zionist themes in a style influenced by the European [[jugendstil]] (similar to [[Art Nouveau]]) and by traditional [[Iranian art|Persian]] and Syrian styles. Exemplars of this style are Rabban's illustrated editions of the [[Book of Ruth]], [[Song of Songs]], [[Book of Job]], [[Book of Esther]], and the [[Passover Hagadah]].&lt;ref name="aatc"/&gt;

Like other European art nouveau artists of the period such as [[Alphonse Mucha]] Raban combined commercial commissions with uncommissioned paintings.  Raban designed the decorative elements of such important [[Jerusalem]] buildings as the [[King David Hotel]] and the Jerusalem YMCA,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerusalemymca.org/ENG/Building/Building.html Jerusalem International YMCA - Architecture: the building&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He also designed a wide range of day-to-day objects, including [[playing cards]] (in the suit of leaves, the King is [[Xerxes I|Ahasuerus]], the Queen is [[Esther]], and the Jack is [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]]), [[Packaging and labelling|commercial packaging]] for products such as [[Hanukkah]] candles and [[Jaffa orange]]s, [[bank note]]s, tourism posters, [[jewelry]], and insignia for Zionist institutions.

"Raban easily navigated a wealth of artistic sources and mediums, borrowing and combining ideas from East and West, fine arts and crafts from past and present. His works blended European neoclassicism, Symbolist art and Art Nouveau with oriental forms and techniques to form a distinctive visual lexicon. Versatile and productive, he lent this unique style to most artistic mediums, including the fine arts, illustration, sculpture, repousee, jewellery design, and ceramics."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=159508073&lt;/ref&gt;

Raban also designed a wide range of Jewish objects, including [[Hanukkah menorah]]s, temple windows, and [[Ark (synagogue)|Torah arks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spertus.edu/museum/collections_description.php Spertus | Spertus Museum | Chicago&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Temple Emanuel (Beaumont, Texas)]] has a  notable  set of six  windows, each 16-feet high].  The windows were commissioned from Raban in 1922 by Rabbi Samuel Rosinger. Each window depicts an  event in the life of one of the principal Hebrew prophets, [[Jeremiah]], [[Elijah]], [[Elisha]], [[Ezekiel]], [[Moses]], and [[Isaiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Stars in Texas: Rabbis And Their Work, By Hollace Ava Weiner, Jimmy Kessler, Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2006, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

Raban collaborated with other artists to produce versions of his work as ceramic tiles, a number of which can still be sees on buildings in [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]], including the [[Bialik House]].  The 1925 Lederberg house, at the intersection of [[Rothschild Boulevard]] and [[Allenby Street]] features a series of large ceramic murals designed by Raban.  The four murals show a Jewish pioneer sowing and harvesting, a shepherd, and Jerusalem with a verse from Jeremiah 31:4, "Again I will rebuild thee and thous shalt be rebuilt."&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Nachman Bialik Home, in Batia Carmiel, Tiles Adorned City; Bezalel ceramics on Tel Aviv Houses, 1923-1929, Eretz Israel Museum, Tel Aviv, copyright 1996, book in Hebrew and some English with illustrations&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 one of his works received international attention. The [[President of Israel]], [[Reuven Rivlin]] visited at the [[White House]] with U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] and First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] for the December 2015 Hannukah celebration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/watch-obama-and-rivlin-light-hanukkah-candles-at-white-house/ Rivlin lights White House menorah with ‘prayer for liberty] the Times of Israel, December 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Israel's First Lady [[Nechama Rivlin]] joined her husband in lighting a menorah made in Israel by Raban, and loaned by the North Carolina Museum of Art’s Judaic Art Gallery. The White House noted: "The design elements of this menorah underscore a theme of coexistence, and its presence in the collection of the Judaic Art Gallery in North Carolina highlights the ties between American Jews and Israeli Jews and the vibrancy of Jewish life in the American South."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/12/09/menorah-hanukkah-reception We Asked, You Answered: "What's the Story Behind Your Menorah?"] The White House, December 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
