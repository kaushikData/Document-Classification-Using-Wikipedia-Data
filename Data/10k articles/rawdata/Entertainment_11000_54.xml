{{refimprove|date=January 2017}}
An '''alternative title''' is a [[Media (communication)|media]] [[sales]] device most prominently used in [[film distribution]]. [[Book]]s and [[film]]s are commonly released under a different [[Title (publishing)|title]] when they are screened or sold in a different country. This can vary from small change to the title, such as the addition of ''The'', to wholesale changes.  Film titles are also often changed when they are released on [[DVD]] or [[VHS]].

==Reasons==
The reasons for this are varied, but usually point towards marketable, [[natural language|linguistic]] or [[cultural differences]]. Some titles may not be easily understood in other parts of the world, and may even be considered offensive. Most title changes are [[Advertising|commercial]]. An example is [[Italy|Italian]] Director's [[Sergio Leone]]'s 1971 film initially released as ''Duck, You Sucker!'', as he was convinced this was a well-known English saying. When the film sold poorly, it was subsequently rebranded as ''[[A Fistful of Dynamite]]'', similar in name to his 1964 film ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', part of the successful [[Dollars Trilogy]].

When [[Scholastic Corporation]] bought the U.S. rights to ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', they thought that a child would not want to read a book with the word "philosopher" in the title and,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/books/ps/book_ss.html|title=Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone |date=2 April 2006|publisher=[[The Harry Potter Lexicon]]|accessdate=12 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; after some discussion, the American edition was published in September 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harrypotter.scholastic.com/jk_rowling/|title=Meet Author J.K.

'''Ausfilm''' is an [[Australia]]n [[government-industry partnership]] that acts as a national [[content attraction]] organisation. '''Ausfilm''' connects the international film community with Australia’s screen incentives, talent and facilities and is composed of about 40 private sector [[screen production]] service companies, as well as the Federal body, DCITA ([[Department of Communications, IT and the Arts]]).

'''Ausfilm''' markets Australia's incentives, locations and capabilities in production and [[Post/Digital/VFX]] (PDV) to attract international content to produce and/or conduct business in Australia, benefiting the Australian economy and film, television and arts industries.

'''Ausfilm''' develops and executes annual campaigns to the global screen market to promote Australia as a production destination, its film-making capabilities and Ausfilm members’ services and work.

'''Ausfilms'''' Incentives are tax based and provide a cash rebate to the producer on Qualifying Australian Production Expenditure. The federal government incentives (Producer Offset, Location Offset, PDV Offset) are mutually exclusive, however can be combined with state government incentives &amp; funding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4427">'''Chekhov's gun''' ({{lang-ru|Чеховское ружьё}}) is a [[drama]]tic principle that states that every element in a story must be necessary, and irrelevant elements should be removed; elements should not appear to make "false promises" by never coming into play. The statement is recorded in letters by [[Anton Chekhov]] several times, with some variation:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Chekhov's art, a stylistic analysis|author=Petr Mikhaĭlovich Bit︠s︡illi|year=1983|publisher=Ardis|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Literature 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Novelists, Playwrights, and Poets of All Time|author=Daniel S.

Bill|year=1987|publisher=Philosophical Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*"Remove everything that has no relevance to the story. If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off.

* "One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off. It's wrong to make promises you don't mean to keep." Chekhov, letter to Aleksandr Semenovich Lazarev (pseudonym of A.

* "If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there." From Gurlyand's ''Reminiscences of A. P. Chekhov'', in ''Teatr i iskusstvo'' 1904, No. 28, 11 July, p.&amp;nbsp;521.&lt;ref&gt;In 1889, 24-year-old Ilia Gurliand noted these words down from Chekhov's conversation: "If in Act I you have a pistol hanging on the wall, then it must fire in the last act". Donald Rayfield, ''Anton Chekhov: A Life'', New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8050-5747-1}}, 203. Ernest. J. Simmons says that Chekhov repeated the point later (which may account for the variations). Ernest J. Simmons, ''Chekhov: A Biography'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962, {{ISBN|0-226-75805-2}}, 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note the difference between Chekhov's Gun and [[foreshadowing]]. Foreshadowing only vaguely implies that an event will take place in the future, meanwhile, the Chekhov's Gun principle guarantee's that an event will happen further along in the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is Chekhov's Gun and How to Use It • The Reedsy Blog |url=https://blog.reedsy.com/chekhovs-gun/ |website=Reedsy |date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Contactjuggling.jpg|thumb|An example of body rolling.]]
[[File:Balle contact 012 - contact juggling.webm|thumb|A man contact juggling]]

'''Contact [[juggling]]''' is a form of [[object manipulation]] that focuses on the movement of objects such as balls in contact with the body. Although often used in conjunction with "[[toss juggling]]", it differs in that it involves the rolling of one or more objects without releasing them into the air.


==History==
Many of the techniques found in contact juggling, such as balancing or rolling a single ball or palm spinning (see "[[Baoding Balls]]"), have been performed for centuries. More variations were introduced by vaudevillians such as [[Paul Cinquevalli]]. In 1986, American juggler Tony Duncan was reported to be holding audiences spellbound with an act that involved rolling a single ball all over his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nielsen|first1=Per|title=From Scandinavia|journal=Juggler's World|issue=Fall 1986|url=http://www.juggle.org/history/archives/jugmags/38-3/38-3,p28.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306032250/http://www.juggle.org/history/archives/jugmags/38-3/38-3%2Cp28.htm|archive-date=6 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Moschen]] brought the form to a new level with  his performance, "Light", developed in the 1980s. In this performance he used 75mm clear crystal balls, palm spinning up to eight balls simultaneously. He finished the act by rolling a single clear ball so that it appeared to float over his hands and arms. Moschen received praise from the international circus community for his range of innovative techniques, and he was made a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellow]] (received a "Genius Award") in 1990. In the 1986 film, ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'', [[David Bowie]]'s character performs contact juggling throughout the film. These manipulations were performed by Moschen, who stood behind Bowie during filming, reaching around and performing the tricks "blind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ministryofmanipulation.com/articles/michael-moschen/ Michael Moschen at the Ministry of Manipulation]&lt;/ref&gt; In the film's credits, Moschen is credited for "crystal ball manipulation."

In the summer of 1990,  John P. Miller (now better known by his pen-name, [[James Ernest]]), wrote and published the first edition of the book ''Contact Juggling'', which covers all of the basic contact juggling techniques and methods for learning them. The first edition had a run of only 100 copies, photocopied and stapled. The second edition was published in 1991, in a [[comb binding|comb-bound]] format, by Ernest Graphics Press, with the author listed as James Ernest.&lt;ref&gt;''Contact Juggling'', second edition {{ISBN|0-9634054-0-3}} Published 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Ernest is credited with coining the term "contact juggling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ministryofmanipulation.com/articles/contact-juggling-james-ernest/ |title=Contact Juggling &amp; James Ernest - The Ministry of Manipulation |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the video "Michael Moschen: In Motion" (created as the television special "In Motion with Michael Moschen" for PBS's "Great Performances" series) was released. Since then, this form of juggling has received further popularization through instructional materials and performances developed by jugglers other than Moschen.  Throughout the 1990s, there was continuing contention within the juggling community regarding whether Moschen's ideas were being stolen by performers and juggling instructors (see "Controversy", below). Many resources have since become available for contact jugglers, such as clubs, books, festivals, videos/DVDs, and balls specifically manufactured for contact juggling.

In 2010, Zoom TV, a direct-marketing company, began mass-marketing "the Fushigi Magic Gravity Ball", an acrylic contact juggling ball with a steel core (used to prevent the focusing of sunlight through a clear acrylic sphere, a fire hazard). Zoom TV claimed that the ball possesses special properties that make it "appear to float" and improve balance and control&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/06/prweb4155454.htm Zoom TV/Ideavillage press release June 18, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; (see "Controversy", below), and saw significant commercial success.

In 2010, an updated and revised third edition of  the book ''Contact Juggling''&lt;ref&gt;''Contact Juggling'', third edition {{ISBN|978-1-59100-027-3}} Published 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was released by Ernest Graphics Press.

==Types==

===Body rolling===

Body rolling means manipulating one or more props (usually balls) around the hands, arms, and other parts of the body. Balance is required to hold the ball in various positions of control. This includes tricks such as [[#Headroll|headrolling]] and the butterfly, the trick of rolling the ball from the palm to the back of the hand via the fingertips.

====Head rolling====

The '''headroll''' is a trick involving rolling an object or prop, typically a ball, around on the juggler's head.  The most commonly performed version is rolling a ball from temple to temple, across the forehead.  At some points during the trick, the object may be [[balance (ability)|balanced]] in place at a certain location on the head.  Points where the prop may be balanced (also known as placement, or trap) include: the temple, the center of the forehead, the back of the neck, the eye socket, the mouth, and the most difficult; the top of the head.

===Palm spinning===

Palm spinning means manipulating one or more balls in the open hand so that at least one ball is in motion. Balls may be in both hands or transferred between hands to form graceful and fluid patterns, including rotating a pyramid made of four or five balls in one hand.

===Isolation moves===

Isolation refers to the manipulation of a ball so that it appears to be suspended in place. Similar to sleight-of-hand techniques in magic or fixed-point mime techniques; the performers exploit the clear surface of the ball to hide any noticeable rotation, creating the effect that the ball is still while the performer moves around the ball.

==Controversy==
Some jugglers have claimed that portions of the book ''Contact Juggling'' and any juggling performances that contain elements similar to Michael Moschen's original "Light" performance are breaches of Moschen's [[intellectual property]] or [[copyright]]. In 1992, Michael Moschen threatened not to attend the [[International Jugglers' Association]] annual conference in Quebec, Canada, where he was to be a guest of honor, due to a favorable review of the book ''Contact Juggling'' in the Fall 1991 issue of the IJA's periodical, ''Juggler's World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alspach|first1=Ted|title=Contact Juggling|journal=Juggler's World|issue=Fall 1991|url=https://www.juggle.org/history/archives/jugmags/43-3/43-3,p15.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016001928/http://www.juggle.org/history/archives/jugmags/43-3/43-3%2Cp15.htm|archive-date=16 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Moschen did attend the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Moschen Searches His Soul For Creative Spark|journal=Juggler's World|issue=Fall 1992|url=https://www.juggle.org/history/archives/jugmags/44-3/44-3,p18.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016002036/http://www.juggle.org/history/archives/jugmags/44-3/44-3%2Cp18.htm|archive-date=16 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The wide commercial success of the "Fushigi Magic Gravity Ball" in 2010 reignited the controversy within the contact juggling community. The television advertisement consisted of a montage of contact juggling performance, the amazed reactions of audience members, suggestions that the ball appeared to float by itself, and an announcer suggesting that the ball can be quickly mastered "in just minutes."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EPAZgogDTA&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about the public depiction of contact juggling being accomplished not by skill but by means of a special prop, contact jugglers quickly filled a Fushigi thread to 100 pages on contactjuggling.org. The Winter 2010 edition of the IJA's periodical ''Juggle'' features a 4-page article about "the Dynamic/Contact/Sphereplay/Fushigi Controversy" by Brad Weston, including an interview with the president of Zoom TV Products, the marketing firm that produced the Fushigi ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weston |first1=Brad |year=2010 |title=The Dynamic/Contact/Sphereplay/Fushigi Controversy |journal=Juggle Magazine |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=26–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following issue featured a rebuttal by a professional contact juggler accusing Zoom TV Products of exploiting contact juggling to sell a deceptively marketed product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Hartnell|first1 = Richard|year = 2011|title = Feedback: Looking Into A Crystal Ball|journal = Juggle Magazine|volume = 13|issue = 1|pages = 9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fushigi ball is no longer in production.

'''Dirk Pitt''' is a [[fictional character]], the protagonist of a series of [[Bestseller|bestselling]] [[Adventure novel|adventure]]/[[Thriller novel|thriller]] [[novel]]s written by [[Clive Cussler]].

==Character information and the supporting cast==
Dirk Eric Pitt is a renowned adventurer. Cussler describes him as tall, 6&amp;nbsp;ft 3 in (190.5&amp;nbsp;cm) with craggy looks, dark wavy hair, and possessing a rangy build. His most striking feature is his opaline green eyes, which can be both alluring or intimidating, as need be. Pitt has a commanding presence which, combined with a quick, sly wit, often infuriates those opposed to him. His comical banter with his sidekick [[Al Giordino]] during stressful situations leaves the reader with little doubt that both are confident of their abilities. While Dirk may be considered the hero of the two, Al Giordino is the man behind him. The character is an avid collector of cars, a characteristic shared with his creator, Clive Cussler.

Dirk is the son of Senator George Pitt of [[California]]. Throughout his life, there have been three women of significance: [[Summer Moran]], Maeve Fletcher, and [[Loren Smith (character)|Loren Smith]].
Summer is the mother of his twin children: a son, [[Dirk Pitt, Jr.]], and a daughter, [[Summer Pitt]]. She is often described as Pitt's first real love. The daughter of deranged scientist Frederick Moran, she was believed dead by Pitt when she was lost during an attempt to rescue her father as his underwater lair collapsed. As revealed by twenty-three-year-old Dirk Pitt Jr. when the two meet in the concluding chapters of the novel ''Valhalla Rising,'' Summer in fact survived, badly maimed by the incident, and refused to seek him out because she wanted Pitt to remember her as he knew her. She gave birth to the twins shortly thereafter and raised them, naming them after their parents.

Dirk met Maeve in ''[[Shock Wave (novel)|Shock Wave]]''. Much like Summer, Maeve was the daughter of a deranged, ruthless individual, Arthur Dorsett, and also became a mother of two. However, unlike Summer, Maeve refused to have any part in her family's dealings or her father's plan, instead deciding to strike out on her own and having her two children out of wedlock. Maeve also ends up earning a master's degree in zoology and is serving as a tour guide aboard a cruise in the Antarctic when she and Pitt first meet. During the events of ''Shock Wave'', Maeve and Dirk pledge their deepest love for each other, but unfortunately Maeve is already fatally wounded, and dies in Pitt's arms.

Pitt has had a long-term relationship with Congresswoman [[Loren Smith (Dirk Pitt character)|Loren Smith]], whom he eventually marries. He graduated from the [[United States Air Force Academy]], and attained the rank of [[major]] (this was changed to the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]] in the film versions of ''[[Raise the Titanic]]'' and ''[[Sahara (2005 movie)|Sahara]]'') with lifelong best friend, [[Al Giordino]]. In the novel ''Flood Tide,'' it is mentioned that he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In the novel ''Pacific Vortex!'' it is revealed that Pitt has been awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] with two clusters, a [[Silver Star]], a [[Purple Heart]] and many other commendations.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Pacific Vortex!'' Page 77 (Reprinted in hardcover by Cahill Press in 2000.)&lt;/ref&gt; Dirk is an accomplished pilot who is qualified to fly both fixed-wing and rotary aircraft. His weapon of choice is a Colt .45-caliber [[M1911]] semi-automatic pistol that he received from his father. His drink of choice is [[blue agave]] [[Tequila]]. Dirk believes that quality tequila should be drunk straight with salt and lime, preferring to use cheaper tequila in [[margaritas]]. He is described as wearing an orange-faced [[Doxa S.A.|Doxa]] dive watch.

Dirk Pitt received a commendation for shooting down [[James Sandecker|Admiral Sandecker]]'s plane during the [[Vietnam War]]. The plane was carrying the Admiral and his staff to a remote base north of [[Da Nang]]. Unknown to them, the base was overrun by the North Vietnamese and their radio was malfunctioning, so they were unable to receive a warning. Pitt was flying nearby returning to his base from a bombing mission and was ordered to intercept and alert the admiral by whatever means available. When efforts to communicate with the Admiral's plane were unsuccessful, Pitt expertly shot out both engines on the transport, forcing them to ditch in the sea instead of landing at the captured base. Dirk then flew cover, strafing any boats that left the shore, until everyone was taken aboard a navy patrol vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Cussler, Clive (1985). "Deep Six", New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. 0-671-50373-1; pages 337 &amp; 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitt is actually named after [[Dirk Cussler]], son of the author, who incidentally is also co-writer of the newest Pitt adventures with his father.

When Dirk Pitt is not traveling, which he is doing most of the time, he lives in his unique home - a remodeled and refurbished hangar on the grounds of [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington National Airport]], near [[Washington, D.C.]]. A cast-iron stairway leads into a cluttered apartment with maps of the sea and models of ships scattered all about. The hangar houses his [[classic car|classic]] and [[antique car|antique]] car collection, as well as a [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] aircraft, a [[Ford trimotor]] aircraft, a [[Pullman Company|Pullman]] railroad dining car, and a [[totem pole]]. The hangar also contains items collected from prior adventures, such as a cast-iron bathtub with an outboard motor fixed to one end, and is protected by a state-of-the-art [[security system]]. Pitt occasionally adds classic cars to his collection purloined from a variety of antagonists over the course of his adventures.

In the course of his work as a [[ocean|marine]] [[engineer]] of the [[National Underwater and Marine Agency#The fictional NUMA|National Underwater and Marine Agency]] (NUMA), an [[oceanographic]] research organization headed by [[James Sandecker|Admiral James Sandecker]] with [[Rudi Gunn]] as second in command, Dirk Pitt has made numerous important shipwreck discoveries, and he has also thwarted a large number of plans by [[villain]]s intent on [[global catastrophe]] or [[Hegemony|world domination]].&lt;br&gt;
Dirk Pitt went on, in the more recent novels, to become the head of NUMA when Admiral James Sandecker was appointed as [[Vice President of the United States]] by President Ward after the Vice President unexpectedly died in office. Despite this appointment, Pitt is uncomfortable with his desk job, and still personally heads projects in the field, becoming entangled in villainous plots just as easily as before his promotion.

===Novel notes===
Although ''Pacific Vortex!'' was released in 1983, it is actually the first Dirk Pitt novel chronologically. The events of ''Pacific Vortex!'' happen before those of ''The Mediterranean Caper.'' In fact, several events in ''Pacific Vortex!'' are referred to in ''The Mediterranean Caper.'' The series does not have to be read in order, since each book stands by itself.

There is also a Dirk Pitt reference book:

* ''Dirk Pitt and Clive Cussler Revealed'' (1998) - Written with [[Craig Dirgo]] which contains photos and a synopsis of the books, as well as a compendium of cars, characters, villains and women that have appeared in the novels throughout the years. Also, there is a biography and interview with Cussler, and a short story ''The Reunion,'' written from the perspective of a character who crashes a party at Pitt's hangar, meeting all the characters who had been predominant in the novels up to that time. Hints dropped throughout the story indicate that this unnamed character is Cussler himself.

===Film notes===
Pitt has twice appeared on the big screen, in movie adaptations of ''[[Raise the Titanic!]]'' in 1980, and ''[[Sahara (2005 movie)|Sahara]]'' in 2005. In the former he was portrayed by [[Richard Jordan]], and in the latter by [[Matthew McConaughey]].

On 10 March 2009, Judge John P. Shook ordered Clive Cussler to pay $13.9 million in legal fees to the production company that turned his novel ''Sahara'' into a motion picture. In his ruling, Judge Shook agreed with lawyers for Crusader Entertainment that an original contract between the two parties called for an award of legal fees if either side breached. "The issue boils down to whether the fees requested are reasonable and necessary," Shook said. He concluded that they were. Cussler sued Crusader in 2004, claiming the company reneged on a contract that gave him approval rights over the film's screenplay, when, in fact, he only had those rights until a director was hired. Crusader, which is owned by billionaire [[Philip Anschutz]], countersued, accusing Cussler of duping it into adapting his book into a film based on an inflated number of novels sold. Jurors ruled in May 2007 in favor of the production company. On July 27, 2009, Cussler issued a final check to Crusader which totals the payback to $20 million to the wronged production company. A March 2010 decision by the California Court of Appeal has since overturned the earlier awardings of both the $5 million in damages and nearly $14 million in legal fees to Crusader.&lt;ref&gt;"Judgement against author Cussler overturned in Anschutz/'Sahara' dispute." Denver Business Journal. 4 March 2010. http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2010/03/01/daily53.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Ellis Stanyon''' (January 1870 – September 1951) was a professional [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] and magic dealer in [[London]].

==History==

Stanyon published and edited his own journal known as ''Magic''.&lt;ref name="Evans 1902"&gt;Evans, Henry R. (1902). [https://archive.org/stream/MagicAndItsProfessors/Magic%20and%20its%20Professors#page/n101/mode/2up ''Magic And Its Professors'']. George Routledge &amp; Sons. p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The journal's aim was to‚ 'popularize the Art of [[Sleight of Hand]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Stanyon|first=Ellis|date=October 1900|title=Introduction|url=http://askalexander.org/display/16596/Stanyon+s+Magic+Vol+01+No+01/2|journal=Magic|volume=1|issue=1|pages=2|subscription=yes|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published from October 1900 and ran for 177 issues with a break during [[World War I]]; the final issue was published in June 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://askalexander.org/display/21976/A+Bibliography+of+Conjuring+Periodicals+in+English+1791+1983/183|title=A Bibliography of Conjuring Periodicals in English: 1791–1983|last=Alfredson|first=James B.|last2=Daily|first2=George L.|publisher=|year=1986|isbn=|location=[[York, Pennsylvania]]|pages=163|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanyon in his journal published a method of escaping from packed boxes. Biographer [[Kenneth Silverman]] has written that the magician [[Harry Houdini]] "accused Stanyon of having posted a bounty of several pounds for his secrets... Houdini dismissed the methods purveyed by Stanyon and others as being nothing like his own, "puny attempts at duplication."&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Kenneth. (1996). ''Houdini!: The Career of Ehrich Weiss''. HarperCollins Publishers. pp. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

Magic historian [[Henry R. Evans]] wrote that Stanyon was "one of the most prolific writers on legerdemain in the world, and his hand-books on magic are largely sought after."&lt;ref name="Evans 1902"/&gt;

'''''Eurotrash''''' was a 30-minute magazine-format programme in English, presented by [[Antoine de Caunes]] and [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]] and produced by Rapido Television. It was shown in the United Kingdom on [[Channel 4]] from 24 September 1993 and was a late-night comical review of unusual topics mainly from Western and Central Europe; though, despite the title, also around the world. The show averaged around a 20 percent audience share, pulling in around 2–3 million viewers each week, making it the most popular entertainment show on the channel.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.rapidotelevision.com/shows/shw.10.php. Rapido TV website, accessed 16 May 2014 (link)]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel 4's slot average for Eurotrash's broadcast time is around 900,000 viewers, making the show an important hit for the channel at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jasper Rees |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/television-review-1093779.html |title=Television Review - Arts &amp; Entertainment |publisher=The Independent |date=1999-05-15 |accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It ran for 16 series (over 160 episodes) until 2007, making it one of the UK's longest running late-night entertainment shows. Channel 4 infrequently re-runs the series and repeats can be found on the [[Comedy Central (UK)|Comedy Central Extra]], [[Real Lives (TV channel)|Real Lives]] and on [[3e]] in Ireland. Series 1 is also now available on [[All 4]]. After more than 10 years of broadcast, the show built up a substantial following and ''Eurotrash'' has around 15 million fans, and various fan sites.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

== History ==

The show was conceived in [[Paris]] for [[London]]-based Rapido Television by producer and director Peter Stuart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lobrano |first=Alexander |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1994/01/21/trash.php |title=France's 'Eurotrash' - Cross-Channel Humor - NYTimes.com |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=1994-01-21 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapido Television makes over 100 programme titles, mostly for Channel 4, and was originally launched with backing by [[Richard Branson]]. The first ''Eurotrash'' series were presented by [[Antoine de Caunes]] and [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]], with narrative voiceovers by British comic actress [[Maria McErlane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-110886/Jean-Paul-Gaultier-turns-fifty.html |title=Jean Paul Gaultier turns fifty &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2002-04-23 |accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaultier left at the end of series 7 and de Caunes then co-presented with a range of guest presenters for the remainder of the run.

A number of features and stars survived from series one, including Pipi and Popo, two cardboard [[giraffes]] made from toilet paper tubes, and the [[Belgian]] singer [[Eddy Wally]]. [[Victoria Silvstedt]] was a semi-regular during 2003, often appearing in the studio with de Caunes to present the ''Naked Germans of the Week'' feature. [[Graham Norton]] featured as a roving reporter in series 9, [[Carla Bruni]] also appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Allen |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1281108/Carla-Bruni-shocked-video-showing-discussing-sex-reappears.html |title=Carla Bruni 'shocked' as video showing her discussing sex reappears &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Rampton |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/contentious-moi-1319330.html |title=Contentious?

In 2009, digital channel [[Living TV]] began airing a series of new compilation episodes under the title ''Eurotrash: The Sexy Bits''. These included new voiceovers from original narrator Maria McErlane.

== Content ==
Despite being a big budget show (around £400,000 per hour to make) the programme was surreal and had a deliberate low budget feel. Bright colourful pop-art studio backgrounds used to be built full size, but in later years [[chromakey]] was used with model shots, adding to the comical 'trashy' feel. Studio material was shot in [[Paris]]. Topics covered included rabbit-showjumping, singing dogs, 'nude cleaning services', magicians, [[Pornographic film actor|porn stars]] (such as the late [[Lolo Ferrari]]) and [[Europe]]'s very worst (but usually popular in their host country) bands and singers.

The series was voiced by Maria McErlane. [[Davina McCall]] provided English voice translations in series 1. In later years [[Kate Robbins]] provided [[voiceover]]s for the strange continental "stars", which she performed in [[Yorkshire]] and other [[British accent|British regional accents]] and similar quirky anglicised effects. Johnny Daukes, former singer and writer with the indie Band FIN in the 1990s, provided male voices in a similar fashion throughout the series.

One issue had an obituary of [[Lolo Ferrari]] which was produced and broadcast with a straight voiceover as a mark of respect, which stood out from the usual comic tone of the programme.

'''''Everyone's Famous''''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] comedy [[web series]], which premiered in 2013.&lt;ref name=chronicle&gt;[http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/1135280-everyone-s-famous-gets-hollywood-kudos "Everyone’s Famous gets Hollywood kudos"]. ''[[The Chronicle Herald]]'', June 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Created by Andrew Bush of the sketch comedy troupe [[Picnicface]], the series stars Ryan Beil as Donald Tipper, an unhappy call centre employee who tries to reinvent himself as a creator of online [[viral video]]s.&lt;ref name=chronicle /&gt; The cast also includes [[Kayla Lorette]], [[Pat Thornton]], Kyle Hickey, [[Molly Dunsworth]], [[Cory Bowles]] and Kevin Kincaid.

The web series consists of seven episodes. All seven episodes were also subsequently reedited into an hour-long comedy special, which aired on [[CBC Television]] on July 6, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://playbackonline.ca/2013/01/09/cbc-acquires-everyones-famous-web-series-for-broadcast/ "CBC acquires Everyone’s Famous web series for broadcast"]. ''[[Playback (website)|Playback]]'', January 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series garnered two [[Canadian Screen Award]] nominations at the [[2nd Canadian Screen Awards]], in the categories of Original Program or Series Produced for Digital Media, Fiction and Performance in a Program or Series Produced for Digital Media (for Pat Thornton).

== Play ==
Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and each player thenceforth counts one number in turn. However, any number [[division (mathematics)|divisible]] by three is replaced by the word ''fizz'' and any divisible by five by the word ''buzz''. Numbers divisible by both become ''fizz buzz''. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.

For example, a typical round of fizz buzz would start as follows:
{{quote|1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, ...}}

== Other uses ==
{{See also|List of Fizz Buzz Implementations}}
Fizz buzz (often spelled "FizzBuzz" in this context) has been used as an interview [[resume screening|screening]] device for computer programmers.&lt;ref&gt;Imran Ghory (2007-01-24).

[http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html "Why Can't Programmers.. Program?"] ''[[Coding Horror]]'' (blog).&lt;/ref&gt; Writing a program to output the first 100 FizzBuzz numbers is a trivial problem for any would-be computer programmer, so interviewers can easily sort out those with insufficient programming ability.

[[File:HDV-Mark001.svg|thumb|HDV Mark]]

'''HDV''' is a format for recording of [[high-definition video]] on [[DV]] cassette [[Videotape|tape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hdv-info.org/page2.htm|title=HDV Press Release|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216151329/http://www.hdv-info.org/page2.htm|archivedate=2009-02-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The format was originally developed by [[JVC]] and supported by [[Sony Corporation|Sony]], [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], and [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.jvc.com/prof/attributes/faq.jsp?tree=&amp;feature_id=13&amp;itempath=&amp;model_id=MDL101539#hdv_hist|title=Didn't JVC invent MPEG? Did JVC invent HDV? – ProHD FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four companies formed the HDV consortium in September 2003.

Conceived as an affordable high definition format for digital [[camcorder]]s, HDV quickly caught on with many amateur and professional videographers due to its low cost, portability, and image quality acceptable for many professional productions.

'''HDV''' and HDV logo are trademarks of [[JVC]] and [[Sony]].&lt;ref name="HDV_Trademarks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hdv-info.org/trademk.htm|title=HDV Trademarks|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417054513/http://www.hdv-info.org/trademk.htm|archivedate=2009-04-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video and audio coding==

HDV video and audio are encoded in digital form, using [[lossy interframe compression]]. Video is encoded with the [[H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2]] compression scheme, using 8-bit chroma and luma samples with 4:2:0 [[chroma subsampling]]. Stereo audio is encoded with the [[MPEG-1 Layer 2]] compression scheme. The compressed audio and video are [[Multiplexing|multiplexed]] into an [[MPEG transport stream|MPEG-2 transport stream]], which is typically recorded onto magnetic tape, but can also be stored in a [[computer file]].

The data rate for both the audio and video is  constant and is roughly the same as DV data rate. The relatively low video data rate can cause ''bit rate starvation'' in scenes that have lots of fine detail, rapid movement or other complex activity like flashing lights, and may result in visible [[Compression artifact|artifacts]], such as [[Macroblock#Macroblocking|blockiness]] and blurring. In contrast to the video, HDV audio bitrate is relatively generous. At the coded bitrate of 384 kbit/s, MPEG-1 Layer 2 audio is regarded as ''perceptually lossless''.

==Recording formats==
Two major versions of HDV are ''HDV&amp;nbsp;720p'' and ''HDV&amp;nbsp;1080i''. The former is used by JVC and is informally known as ''HDV1''. The latter is preferred by Sony and Canon and is sometimes referred to as ''HDV2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eventdv.net/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=37958|title=Editing HDV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''HDV&amp;nbsp;1080i'' defines optional progressive recording modes, and in recent publications is sometimes called ''HDV&amp;nbsp;1080'' or ''1080-line HDV'' as progressive 1080-line recording becomes commonplace.&lt;ref name="HDVProgressivePrimer"&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.sony.ca/hdv/files/white/HDV_Progressive_Primer.pdf|title=HDV progressive primer|accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DiscoveryHDTheaterReqs"&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://dhd.discovery.com/guidelines/gallery/guidelines.pdf|title=Discovery HD Theater production requirements|accessdate=2010-01-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516114103/http://dhd.discovery.com/guidelines/gallery/guidelines.pdf|archivedate=2011-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HDV 720p {{anchor|HDV 720p}} ===
HDV&amp;nbsp;720p format allows recording high definition video (HDV-HD) as well as progressive-scan standard definition video (HDV-SD).&lt;ref name="LWT0278-001B-H"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.jvcservice.com/Download/903683488/LWT0278-001B-H.pdf|title=JVC GY-HD100/HD-101 instructions}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HDV-HD closely matches broadcast 720p [[progressive scan]] video standard in terms of scanning type, frame size, aspect ratio and data rate. Earlier HDV&amp;nbsp;720p camcorders could shoot only at 24, 25 and 30 frames per second. Later models offer both film-like (24p, 25p, 30p) and reality-like (50p, 60p) frame rates.

HDV-SD is a mode for recording progressive-scan standard definition video. Such a video is sometimes called ''enhanced definition video'' ([[Enhanced-definition television|EDTV]]), but is considered high definition video in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com.au/hd-tv-resolution-explained-339271051.htm|title=HD TV resolution explained|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809075542/http://www.cnet.com.au/hd-tv-resolution-explained-339271051.htm|archivedate=2010-08-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on region, HDV-SD video is recorded either as 576p50 or as 480p60. Like [[DV#DVCPRO_Progressive|DVCPRO Progressive]], HDV-SD was meant as an intermediate format during the transition time from standard definition to high definition video. Later models of HDV&amp;nbsp;720p camcorders do not record in this mode.

JVC was the only manufacturer of HDV&amp;nbsp;720p camcorders. JVC was the first to release an HDV camcorder, the handheld GR-HD1. Later JVC shifted its HDV development to shoulder-mounted cameras.

A common misconception is that JVC developed a proprietary extension to HDV called [[ProHD]], featuring film-like 24-frame/s progressive recording mode and LPCM audio, for professional use. JVC has clarified that ProHD is not a video recording format, but "an approach for delivering affordable HD products" and a common name for "bandwidth efficient professional HD models".

=== HDV 1080i {{anchor|HDV 1080i}} ===
[[File:Interlaced video frame (car wheel).jpg|thumb|250px|When interlaced video is watched on a progressive monitor without proper deinterlacing, it exhibits combing when there is movement between two fields of one frame.]]
Sony adapted HDV, originally conceived as progressive-scan format by JVC, to interlaced video. Interlaced video has been a useful compromise for decades due to its ability to display motion smoothly while reducing recording and transmission bandwidth. Interlaced video is still being used in acquisition and broadcast, but interlaced display devices are being phased out. Modern [[Flat panel display|flat-panel]] television sets that utilize [[Plasma Display|plasma]] and [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] technology are inherently progressive. All modern computer monitors use progressive scanning as well. 

Before interlaced video is displayed on a progressive-scan device it must be converted to progressive using the process known as [[deinterlacing]]. Progressive-scan television sets employ built-in deinterlacing circuits to cope with interlaced broadcast signal, but computer video players rarely have this capability. As such, interlaced video may exhibit ghosting or combing artifacts when watched on a computer.

Some HDV&amp;nbsp;1080i camcorders are capable of recording progressive video within an interlaced stream, provided that the frame rate does not exceed half of the [[Rec. 709#Frame rate|field rate]]. The first HDV 1080i camcorder to implement such ''Progressive Scanning'' was the Sony HVR-V1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camcorderinfo.com/content/Sony-Introduces-HVR-V1U-and-HDD-Unit-in-US.htm|title=Camcorderinfo.com: Sony Introduces HVR-V1U and HDD Unit in the U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To preserve compatibility with interlaced equipment the HVR-V1 records and outputs video in interlaced form. 25-frame/s and 30-frame/s progressive video is recorded on tape using [[progressive segmented frame]] (PsF) technique, while 24-frame/s recording employs [[Telecine#3:2 pulldown .28technically.2C 2:3 pulldown.29|2-3 pulldown]]. The camcorder offers two variations of 24-frame/s recording: "24" and "24A". In "24" mode the camera ensures that there are no cadence breaks for a whole tape, this mode works better for watching video directly from the camera and for adding "film look" to interlaced video. In the "24A" mode the camera starts every clip on an A frame with timecode set to an even second margin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dv.com/reviews/reviews_item.php?articleId=196602843|title=dv.com: Sony HVR-V1 review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvinfo.net/conf/sony-hvr-v1-hdr-fx7/82350-explained-24-verses-24a.html|title=DVInfo: EXPLAINED: "24" versus "24A"|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120803113147/http://www.dvinfo.net/conf/sony-hvr-v1-hdr-fx7/82350-explained-24-verses-24a.html|archivedate=2012-08-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and records the 2-3 pull-down identification data in the HDV stream, so that compatible NLE software knows when to remove the 2-3 pull-down cadences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pro.sony.com/bbsccms/ext/hdv/z7u_s270u_m35u/HVR-Z7U/ft04.html|title=HDV 24p/30p Progressive Scan Modes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several editing tools, including Sony's own [[Sony Vegas|Vegas]], are capable of processing 24A video as proper 24 frame/s progressive video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalcontentproducer.com/hdhdv/depth/hdvatwork_sony_hvrv1u_031207|title=Steve Mullen, Reviewing Sony HVR-V1U HDV Camcorder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the HVR-V1, Sony was offering ''Cineframe'', essentially an interlaced-to-progressive converter, to simulate film-like motion. The conversion process involved blending and discarding fields, so vertical resolution of the resulting video suffered. Motion, produced in the 24-frame/s variant of Cineframe was too uneven for professional use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamwilt.com/HDV/cineframe.html|title=Adam Wilt, How the Sony HDV cameras fake 24, 25, and 30 frame/s}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same or better [[film look]] effect can be achieved by converting regular interlaced video into progressive format using computer software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hdtvexpert.com/pages_b/hdrfx1.html|title=Steve Mullen, Sony's HDR-FX1 1080i HDV Camcorder: using CineFrame 24 mode|access-date=2008-09-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006001925/http://www.hdtvexpert.com/pages_b/hdrfx1.html|archive-date=2008-10-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Canon commoditized progressive scanning, releasing the [[Canon HV20|HV20]] camcorder. The version for 50&amp;nbsp;Hz market featured PF25 mode with PsF-like recording, while the version for 60&amp;nbsp;Hz market had PF24 mode, which utilized 2-3 pulldown scheme. Progressive scan video recorded with the HV20 does not include flags necessary for performing automated film-mode deinterlacing, which is why most editing tools treat such video as interlaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hv20.com/showpost.php?p=138512&amp;postcount=23|title=Sony Vegas Movie Studio Platinum 9.0: no more pulldown hassle?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canon HV30|HV30]], released in 2008, implemented additional PsF-like PF30 mode for 60&amp;nbsp;Hz markets. Output is performed via component, HDMI and [[FireWire]] in interlaced form.&lt;ref name="canonpmodes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avchduser.com/articles/canon_progressive_modes.jsp|title=Canon 24P, 25F, 25P, 30F, 30P modes explained|access-date=2008-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212012956/http://www.avchduser.com/articles/canon_progressive_modes.jsp|archive-date=2008-12-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressive scan video must be properly deinterlaced to achieve full vertical resolution and to avoid interlace artifacts. 25P and 30P video must be deinterlaced with "weave" or "no deinterlacing" algorithm, which means joining two fields of each frame together into one progressive frame. This operation can be done in most editing tools simply by changing project properties from interlaced to progressive. 24P video must go through ''film-mode deinterlacing'' also known as [[Telecine#Reverse_telecine_.28a.k.a._IVTC.2Finverse_telecine.29|inverse telecine]], which throws out [[Telecine#Telecine_judder|judder frames]] and restores original 24-frame/s progressive video. Many editing tools cannot perform film-mode deinterlacing, requiring usage of a separate converter.

=== HDV 1080p ===

[[File:Hdv native progressive recording mark.png|thumb|Native Progressive Recording logo (Sony)]]

[[File:Canon-logo-24p-native-progressive.jpg|thumb|Native Progressive logo (Canon)]]

The original 1080-line HDV specification defined interlaced recording only, which is suitable for television broadcast. As users have become increasingly interested in [[digital cinematography]] and in [[web video]]s, progressive recording became a necessity. In response to this need, capability for native progressive recording has been added to the 1080i HDV specification. Progressive recording modes are optional for 1080i HDV devices, which means that not every HDV&amp;nbsp;1080i camcorder or deck is capable of recording or playing back native progressive video. Because HDV&amp;nbsp;1080i specification now includes both interlaced and progressive recording modes, in recent publications it is often called ''HDV&amp;nbsp;1080'' or ''1080-line HDV'', but the official name still bears the "i" suffix.

HDV camcorders capable of native 1080-line progressive video record it at rates of  23.98 frame/s (commonly referred to as "24p") and 29.97 frame/s ("30p") for 60&amp;nbsp;Hz markets, and at 25 frame/s ("25p") for 50&amp;nbsp;Hz markets. Video is output as true progressive video via an [[IEEE 1394 interface|i.LINK/Firewire]] port. Output through other ports is performed in interlaced mode to preserve compatibility with existing interlaced equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papahui.com/download.pdf|title=Sony HVR-Z5U Digital HD Video Camera Recorder}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.sony.co.uk/res/attachment/file/97/1219910881397.pdf|title=Sony HVR-Z5E preliminary datasheet|accessdate=2010-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216102821/http://www.sony.co.uk/res/attachment/file/97/1219910881397.pdf|archive-date=2010-02-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 1080-line HDV camcorder to offer recording in native progressive format was the Canon XL&amp;nbsp;H1, introduced in 2006. It was followed by the XH-G1 and [[Canon XH-A1|XH-A1]]. When shooting in progressive mode, also known as ''Frame mode'', these camcorders generate progressive video from interlaced CCD sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.canon.com/app/html/XLH1/frame_rates_formats.shtml|title=Canon XL&amp;nbsp;H1: frame rates &amp; formats}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of row-pair summation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcontentproducer.com/images/archive/209vsshexp.pdf Progressive: what you need to know]&lt;/ref&gt; vertical resolution of progressive video is 10%-25% lower than resolution of interlaced video.&lt;ref&gt;[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP034_ADD25-Canon-XHG1.pdf Colorimetric and resolution test of the Canon XH G1 and XH A1 cameras, by Alan Roberts, BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TEXAS_SHOOTOUT_P2"&gt;{{cite web

In 2008 Sony released its own models capable of native progressive recording: the HVR-S270, the HVR-Z7 and the HVR-Z5. Sony stressed out that the models handle the signal entirely in progressive mode all the way from capture to encoding to recording on tape to output.&lt;ref name="HDVProgressivePrimer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://pro.sony.com/bbsccms/assets/files/micro/hdv/brochures/HVR-Z5U_brochure_final10-08.pdf|title=Sony HVR-Z5U brochure, p. 7|accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony has designed ''Native Progressive Recording'' logo for the devices that are capable of native progressive recording and playback.

In 2009 Canon released the HV40 HDV camcorder. Its 60&amp;nbsp;Hz variant, carrying prominent ''24p native progressive'' mark, became the first consumer HDV model to offer 24-frame/s native progressive recording. Like the aforementioned Sony models, the HV40 uses true progressive-scan sensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.canon.com/templatedata/pressrelease/20090105_camcorders.html|title=Canon U.S.A. packs a punch with a powerful new camcorder line-up for 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite differences in branding, native progressive modes offered by Canon and Sony are fully compatible, with both companies adhering to HDV specifications for recording native 1080p video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvinfo.net/conf/1097708-post3.html|title=Using the Canon HV30 to capture 30P footage shot on the Z7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvinfo.net/conf/930512-post1.html|title= Sony HVR M15AU and the Canon XH/XL series}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvinfo.net/forum/canon-xh-series-hdv-camcorders/475916-sony-z7-25p-tapes-a1.html|title= Sony Z7 25p tapes in an A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lafcpug.org/phorum/read.php?1,237084|title=Using Sony HVR M15AU to digitize Canon footage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://provideocoalition.com/index.php/atepper/story/canon_hv40_a_great_inexpensive_feeder_deck_for_native_sony_3g_hdv_recording/|title=Canon HV40: a great inexpensive feeder deck for native Sony 3G HDV recordings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other HDV devices capable of reading and recording in native progressive 1080-line format include the Sony HVR-M15AU, HVR-25AU,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sel.sony.com/en/press_room/b2b/broadcast_production/pro_audio_video/release/34858.html|title=Sony adds new features to HDV videotape recorders }}&lt;/ref&gt; HVR-M15AE, HVR-25AE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.co.uk/biz/view/ShowPressRelease.action?section=SB+SS+ALL+Press+Center&amp;pressrelease=1207064692287&amp;site=biz_en_GB|title=Sony adds new features to HDV videotape recorders (Europe)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and HVR-M35 HDV videocassette recorders, and the 60&amp;nbsp;Hz Canon HV20/HV30 camcorders when used in tape recorder mode.

==Compatibility==

Generally, HDV devices are capable of playing and recording in DV format, though this is not required by HDV specification. Many HDV devices manufactured by Sony are capable of playing and recording in [[DV#DVCAM|DVCAM]] format. 1080-line devices generally are not compatible with 720-line devices, though some standalone tape decks accept both HDV flavors. Devices that can play and record native 1080p video can play and record native 1080i video, however the opposite is not always the case.

HDV camcorders are usually offered with either 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz scanning rate depending on a region. Some models, like Canon XH-A1/G1 and third-generation Sony models such as HVR-S270, HVR-Z5 and HVR-Z7, can be made switchable for "world" capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://provideocoalition.com/index.php/atepper/story/sony_upgrades_3g_hdv_camcorders_to_universal_for_a_small_fee/|title=Sony upgrades 3G HDV camcorders to universal, for a small fee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some JVC ProHD products like the GY-HD200UB and GY-HD250U are world-capable out of the box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.jvc.com/prof/attributes/features.jsp?model_id=MDL101625|title=GY-HD250U - 3CCD ProHD camcorder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HDV is closely related to [[XDCAM]] and to [[MOD and TOD (video format)|TOD]] families of recording formats, which use the same video encoding — MPEG-2. In particular, HDV&amp;nbsp;720p is equivalent to 19&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s XDCAM&amp;nbsp;EX recording mode used in tapeless JVC ProHD camcorders, while HDV&amp;nbsp;1080i is equivalent to 25&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s XDCAM&amp;nbsp;HD recording mode and to ''1440CBR'' TOD recording mode.

== Recording media ==

[[File:Small dv and hdv cassettes front.jpg|thumb|250px|MiniDV cassettes for DV and HDV recording]]

The HDV consortium allows using the HDV trademarks only for products that incorporate a tape drive that can record and play video cassette compliant to the HDV format.&lt;ref name="HDV_Trademarks"/&gt; Therefore, HDV remains a tape-based format. Various solutions for tapeless recording of HDV video that are available on the market are not covered by HDV specification.

=== Magnetic tape ===

Most HDV camcorders use "small" [[DV#Magnetic_tape|DV cassettes]] also known as MiniDV cassettes. The Sony HVR-S270 shoulder-mount camcorder is capable of recording both onto "small" and "large" cassettes. Because HDV has the same data rate as DV, recording time is the same as DV Standard Play. Unlike DV, HDV does not offer Long Play speed.

A standard MiniDV cassette provides one hour of recording. By using cassettes with longer and thinner tape it is possible to record up to 80 minutes onto one MiniDV cassette, though usage of such tape is not recommended. Large DV cassette loaded with longer tape can deliver up to 4.5 hours of recording time.

Tape manufacturers also offer MiniDV cassettes specifically for HDV recording. Such cassettes have the same Metal Evaporate (ME) formulation as  normal DV cassettes, but are claimed to have reduced drop-out rate compared to standard DV cassettes. Usage of such cassettes is not required by HDV specification.

=== File-based media ===

[[File:CompactFlash.jpg|thumb|250px|Type I [[CompactFlash]] card]]

Since HDV was introduced, ''tapeless'' — or ''file-based'' — video recording formats such as [[P2 (storage media)|DVCPRO&amp;nbsp;P2]], [[XDCAM]] and [[AVCHD]] have gained broad acceptance. The trend towards tapeless workflow was accelerated with increased capacity and reduced cost of non-linear media like [[hard disk drive]]s (HDD), optical discs and solid-state memory.

Recognizing the need for faster workflow, JVC, Sony and other manufacturers offer on-camera recording units, which convert an HDV camcorder into a hybrid system capable of recording both onto tape and onto file-based media. These recorders connect to a camcorder via [[Firewire]] and do not [[video compression|recompress]] HDV video, offering exactly the same image quality as if video were recorded on tape.

JVC offers two FireStore recorders made by Focus Enhancements: the HDD-based DR-HD100&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.jvc.com/prof/attributes/features.jsp?model_id=MDL101822|title=ProHD 100GB hard disk recorder MR-HD100}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MR-HD100&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.jvc.com/prof/attributes/features.jsp?model_id=MDL101711|title=100GB HD hard disk recorder DR-HD100}}&lt;/ref&gt; on-camera recorders; it also offers the [[SxS]]-based KA-MR100G&lt;ref name="KA-MR100G"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.jvc.com/prof/attributes/features.jsp?model_id=MDL101824|title=SxS memory card docking recorder KA-MR100G}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorder. Canon offers Focus Enhancements FS-CF and FS-CF Pro models, which record onto [[CompactFlash]] memory cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.canon.com/cusa/professional/products?pageKeyCode=pressreldetail&amp;docId=0901e02480134568|title=CF-card recording with Canon HDV camcorders through Focus Enhancements solid state DTE recorders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony offers the HDD-based HVR-DR60&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/product-HVRDR60 | title=HVR-DR60 HDV hard disk recorder}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the CompactFlash-based HVR-MRC1K&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/product-HVRMRC1K | title=HVR-MRC1K Memory Recording Unit}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorders.

Recording time depends on capacity of media used. In particular, a 32&amp;nbsp;GB CompactFlash card is good for 144 minutes of HDV video. The HVR-DR60 can fit over two hours of high definition video, while the FireStore models with 100&amp;nbsp;GB disk drive can store almost four hours of footage. File-based recorders are invaluable for continuous recording that extends one hour.

== Use in broadcast television ==

HDV is accepted for broadcast TV use with varying restrictions.

Discovery Channel chose HDV handhelds for shooting ''[[Deadliest Catch]]'' despite their reduced light sensitivity and a large depth of focus, because smaller cameras were better for crew safety and they destroy several dozen cameras per series.&lt;ref name="Not_big_but_rather_clever"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/not-big-but-rather-clever/2012867.article
 |title=Not big but rather clever
 |date=2009-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; HDV camcorders were also used for shooting ''[[MythBusters]]''. 

In February 2009 ITV News bought 68 Sony HVR-Z5E handheld camcorders for its multi-skilling journalists.&lt;ref name="Not_big_but_rather_clever"/&gt; The camcorders, which come with non-removable 20x lens and outfitted with CompactFlash recorders became popular among journalists who are not trained camera operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the TV series ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' made for [[CBS Television Studios|CBS]], handheld HDV camcorders were used for scenes where larger HD cameras would have been impractical. 

The [[BBC Television|BBC]] does not consider HDV to meet HD broadcast standards, therefore acceptability of HDV footage for HD programming is limited to 25% of the program's total duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Discovery HD Theater]] accepts content sourced from 1080-line HDV camcorders, but limits it to 15% of a whole program. Producers wishing to use HDV are required to submit an approved postproduction path outlining their handling of the footage in the editing process.&lt;ref name="DiscoveryHDTheaterReqs"/&gt; The Discovery Channel HD simulcast has fewer or no guidelines and accepts a mix of XDCAM HD, HDV and AVCHD for the length of a program. For example, Discovery Channel aired ''911: The Bronx'', a six-episode reality series set in a hospital and shot with HDV cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The [[Travel Channel#Travel Channel HD|Travel Channel HD]] eagerly accepts HDV footage. For example, Sony HDV camcorders were used for production of highly acclaimed [[Anthony Bourdain]]'s ''[[Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations|No Reservations]]'' program, among other cameras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dv.com/article/16070 Global Gastronome: Shooting HD for " No Reservations"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.travelchannel.com/no-reservations-crew/2008/02/26/careful-with-that-wish-eugene/#comment-290 Q&amp;A With the No Reservations Crew]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern]]'' and its follow-up ''[[Bizarre World]]'' are shot with Sony HDV cameras as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvxuser.com/V6/showpost.php?p=1858278&amp;postcount=15  Broadcast-ready HDV]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Madventures (Finnish TV program)|Madventures]]'' was shot with the Sony EX1 XDCAM EX camera paired with the Sony HVR-A1U HDV camcorder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madventures.tv/stranded/viewtopic.php?f=37&amp;t=2821&amp;start=0#p31680 Madventures blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Current TV]] used Sony HDV camcorders to shoot episodes for [[Vanguard (TV series)|Vanguard]] TV series.

''[[Guiding Light]]'', the longest-running soap opera in production in television and radio history, broke away from traditional three-sided sets and pedestal-style cameras in 2008, choosing the handheld [[Canon XH-A1|Canon XH-G1]] for shooting on practical locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |format=PDF |url=http://www.highdef.com/magazine/archive/HighDef_2008_5SepOct.pdf|title=Canon XH G1 HD - Guiding Light, HighDef Sep-Oct 2008, p. 27|accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editing==

Because HDV video is recorded in digital form, original content can be copied onto another tape or ''captured'' to a computer for editing without quality degradation. Depending on capturing software and computer's file system, either a whole tape is captured into one contiguous file, or the video is split in smaller 4 GB or 2 GB segments, or a separate [[computer file|file]] is created for each take. The way files are named depends on capturing software. Some systems convert HDV video into proprietary ''intermediate'' format on the fly while capturing, so original format is not preserved.

HDV footage can be natively edited by most non-linear editors, with real-time playback being possible on modern mainstream personal computers. Slower computers may exhibit reduced performance compared to other formats such as [[DV]] because of high resolution and interframe compression of HDV video.

Editing performance can be improved by converting HDV to intermediate format prior to editing. These include various [[Cineform]] products, Edius HQ, [[DNxHD codec|Avid DNxHD]], [[Apple Intermediate Codec]] and [[ProRes 422|Apple ProRes 422]], among others. Usage of an intermediate codec adds one more ''generation'' to the video, potentially degrading its quality. On another hand, an intermediate codec can reduce blockiness and fix other issues in the original video, like interlaced chroma in progressive recordings. 

Depending on the [[non-linear editing system]] (NLE), it is possible to minimize generation losses by editing native HDV video using straight cuts only, with no effects, and rendering back to HDV. Up to 15 frames per each cut may be re-encoded because of the long-[[Group of pictures|GOP]] nature of HDV video.

==Distributing==

HDV video can be recorded or ''printed'' back to tape. Such tapes are often accepted by local television stations, though many organizations prefer the submissions to be delivered in higher-end format like [[Betacam#Digital Betacam|Digital Betacam]], [[HDCAM]] or [[D5 HD]].&lt;ref name="DiscoveryHDTheaterReqs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PBSReqs"/&gt; It is also possible to record M2TS file to any media that offers enough capacity, like a DVD, external HDD drive or a memory card.

For consumer use, HDV-sourced video can be delivered on a [[Blu-ray Disc]] without re-encoding, can be converted to [[AVCHD]] and delivered on an [[AVCHD#AVCHD as distribution format|AVCHD disc]], or can be downconverted to [[DVD-Video]].

== Products ==
=== Canon ===
[[File:Canon XLH1 HD Camera side view.jpg|thumb|Canon XL-H1]]
[[File:Canon-HV30-front-left.jpg|thumb|right|Canon HV30]]

Canon entered the HDV market in September 2005, with the [[Canon XL H1]], a professional-oriented modular camera system with interchangeable lenses, HD-SDI output, and three 1440 × 1080 ⅓" CCDs. This was the first HDV camcorder to allow 1080-line native progressive recording.
 
In July 2006, Canon announced the handheld [[List of Canon camcorders#Canon XH-A1|XH&amp;nbsp;A1/XH&amp;nbsp;G1]] models, which use the same sensor as the XL-H1. Both models share the same body and most of the features, with the XH&amp;nbsp;G1 geared towards professional multi-camera production and including connections for [[Serial Digital Interface|HD-SDI/SD-SDI Out]], [[genlock]], and [[time code]]. 

Later in the same year, Canon introduced the consumer-oriented [[Canon HV10]], a compact unit with a single 2.76 megapixel CMOS sensor. The camera recorded interlaced video only.

In April 2007 Canon released the [[Canon HV20|HV20]] which used the same sensor and internal processor as the HV10, had a larger lens and more conventional layout. This was the first consumer HDV camcorder that featured progressive shooting modes in addition to native interlaced recording. Progressive-scan video was recorded within interlaced container to remain compatible with consumer level editing suites. The version for 50&amp;nbsp;Hz market offered PF25 mode, which utilized [[Progressive segmented Frame]] technique, while the 60&amp;nbsp;Hz variant featured PF24 mode, which utilized 2-3 pulldown scheme. 

The [[Canon HV30|HV30]], released in 2008, was a minor update of the HV20. The body color has been changed from silver to black, the LCD screen has been improved, and the 60&amp;nbsp;Hz variant implemented PsF-like PF30 mode.

In 2009 Canon released the [[Canon HV40|HV40]]. Its 50&amp;nbsp;Hz variant was practically identical to the HV30, while the 60&amp;nbsp;Hz variant became the first consumer HDV camcorder capable of native progressive 24&amp;nbsp;frames/s recording.

=== JVC ===
[[File:jvc-hdv-4642.JPG|thumb|JVC GY-HD100]]

In 2003 JVC released the first HDV [[camcorder]] — the handheld GR-HD1. The camcorder offered standard DV recording mode, HDV [[720p]]30 and HDV [[480p]]60. The HDV modes used the older [[Rec. 601]] standard for color space, rather than the newer [[Rec. 709]] standard intended for high-definition video. The imager of the GR-HD1 used a single 1/3" [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] sensor instead of a 3CCD setup, another unusual choice discouraging professional use.The GR-HD1 was not popular in either the consumer or semi-professional market, and JVC later shifted its HDV development to professional shoulder-mounted cameras.

The shoulder mount GY-HD100 camcorder was released in 2005 and featured 3CCD imaging system with native 720p resolution, interchangeable lens and 24 frame/s recording. Because of the latter feature this camcorder became popular for shooting "digital movies". The updated version, GY-HD110, provides several updates and fixed split-screen effect found on some GY-HD100 cameras.

The GY-HD200, released later, offered 50p/60p recording, 720p-to-1080i converter and Anton Bauer professional battery with mount.

In 2006 JVC released the GY-HD250, which simplified multi-camera recording by providing genlock and time code input/output. HD/SD-SDI output allowed to record uncompressed video.

In 2008 the "B" modification of the GY-HD200 was released, allowing live recording of either 720p or 1080i signal onto an external tapeless recorder. Recording to tape was still performed in 720p mode only.

=== Sharp===
Sharp is the only member of the HDV Consortium that has not produced an HDV camcorder or a videocassette recorder. The closest Sharp has ever got in supporting HDV standard is the AQUOS DV-ACV52 digital video player. The player supports HDV video, though it does not have a tape transport. Instead, it allows playback and dubbing of DV/HDV video from a camcorder connected to the player via a FireWire connector.

Sony specializes in 1080i HDV equipment and makes products for both 60&amp;nbsp;Hz and 50&amp;nbsp;Hz markets. Traditionally, Sony uses suffixes "E" and "P" to identify 50&amp;nbsp;Hz models, and suffix "U" or no suffix at all to identify 60&amp;nbsp;Hz models. Models listed below are specified without suffixes.

In September 2004 [[Sony]] released the first HDV&amp;nbsp;1080i camcorder, the [[Sony HDR-FX1|HDR-FX1]]. Its professional version, the [[Sony HVR-Z1|HVR-Z1]], came with [[XLR connector|XLR]] audio inputs and 44 additional features. Most notably, the HVR-Z1 was switchable between 50&amp;nbsp;Hz and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz scanning to cater for the different scanning rates used in different markets.

In the middle of 2005 Sony released its first consumer HDV model, the [[Sony HDR-HC1|HDR-HC1]], which had a single CMOS sensor, electronic stabilization system and was capable of recording in DV and HDV&amp;nbsp;1080i modes. Its professional version, the HVR-A1, added a second accessory shoe in place of the flash, XLR audio inputs, additional recording options, larger eyecup and larger lens hood. 

In 2006 Sony replaced the HDR-HC1 with the smaller and cheaper HDR-HC3, which featured an incrementally improved CMOS chip, but omitted some features of its predecessor. The HDR-HC3 was replaced by the HDR-HC5 which used the same CMOS chip as the HDR-HC3, and added an option of recording in [[xvYCC]] color space. The replacement model, the HDR-HC7 came with a higher pixel count CMOS sensor and with a microphone input. Like the HDR-HC5, the HDR-HC7 could also record [[xvYCC]]. In 2008 the HDR-HC7 was replaced with the HDR-HC9.

In 2006, Sony added two new models to its upscale HDV lineup: the "advanced amateur" [[Sony HDR-FX7|HDR-FX7]] and its professional cousin, the HVR-V1. The progressive-scan CMOS sensors of these models resolve full 1080 lines of vertical resolution. The HDR-FX7 records interlaced video only, while the HVR-V1 offers the choice of shooting interlaced or progressive video. Progressive video is converted to interlaced using pulldown for recording onto tape.

In August 2007, Sony introduced the shoulder-mounted version of the HDR-HC7, the HVR-HD1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sel.sony.com/en/press_room/b2b/broadcast_production/release/31159.html|title=HVR-HD1000U Press Release (Sony)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, Sony announced the HVR-Z7 handheld camcorder and the HVR-S270 shoulder-mounted camera. Both use the same three 1/3" ClearVid CMOS sensors and attain light sensitivity similar to that of the venerable DSR-PD170 while offering HDV recording in native interlaced, progressive scan and native progressive modes. The Z7 has 2 XLR audio inputs and HDMI output while the S270 has 4 XLR inputs and features HD-SDI output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eventdv.net/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=41396|title=EventDV article on Sony HVR-Z7U}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently the HVR-S270 is the only HDV camcorder capable of recording onto full-size DV cassettes.

In 2008 the HDR-FX1 and the HVR-Z1 were replaced with the HDR-FX1000 and the HVR-Z5, respectively. The major changes include utilizing CMOS sensors instead of CCD, and progressive mode shooting. The FX1000 records progressive scan video using pulldown, while HVR-Z5 offers native progressive recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/newsLetter/HDR-FX1000.jsp|title=Sony's HDR-FX1000 breaks the mold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008 Sony restarted production of the HDR-FX7 camcorder, which had been discontinued a year earlier. Offered for almost half the original price, the HDR-FX7 bridged the gap between the HDR-HC9 and the FX1000.

In summer 2009 Sony discontinued the HDR-HC9 on the North American market, but restarted its sales in spring 2010, this time advertising it not as an HDV camcorder, but as a MiniDV&amp;nbsp;HD camcorder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;productId=8198552921665842112 MiniDV HD Handycam Camcorder HDR-HC9]&lt;/ref&gt; MiniDV&amp;nbsp;HD has never been officially presented as an alternative name for HDV. The other competing HD recording standard that uses DV cassettes is [[DV#DVCPRO HD|DVCPROHD]]. In spring 2011 the HDR-HC9 is no longer available for purchase from the Sony's North American online store.

==Future of HDV==

JVC released its latest HDV camcorder — the GY-HD250 — in 2006. In September 2011 this model was discontinued on the U.S. market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest HDV camcorder made by Canon — the HV40 — was released in 2009, but it traces back to the HV20 developed in 2007, and was phased out of production during 2011, though stocks have lasted through 2012. The latest Sony consumer HDV model is the HDR-HC9, originally released in 2008 and discontinued on the North American market in 2011. 2008 was also the year when Sony presented the latest "advanced amateur" and professional HDV camcorders, namely the HDR-FX1000 and the HVR-Z5.

All the three major manufacturers of HDV equipment — JVC, Canon and Sony — have heavily invested in development of MPEG-2 video compression scheme and continue to rely on it in their professional tapeless camcorder lineups: XDCAM&amp;nbsp;HD (Sony), XDCAM&amp;nbsp;EX (Sony and JVC), XDCAM&amp;nbsp;HD422 (Sony), XF&amp;nbsp;Codec (Canon). At the same time Sony and Canon have joined Panasonic in marketing of [[AVCHD]] recording format, which is claimed to deliver visual quality similar to HDV at half the datarate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''''Heidi'' Game''' or '''''Heidi'' Bowl''' was an [[American Football League]] (AFL) game played on November 17, 1968, between the [[1968 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] and the visiting [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]]. The game was notable for its exciting finish, in which Oakland scored two [[touchdowns]] in the final minute to win the game 43–32, but got its name for a decision by the game's television broadcaster, [[NBC]], to break away from its coverage of the game on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] to broadcast the [[television film]] ''[[Heidi (1968 film)|Heidi]]'', causing many viewers to miss the Raiders' comeback.

In the late 1960s, few professional football games took longer than two and a half hours to play, and the Jets–Raiders' three-hour time slot was thought to be adequate. A high-scoring contest, together with a number of injuries and penalties for the two bitter AFL rivals, caused the game to run long. NBC executives had originally ordered that ''Heidi'' begin at 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]], but decided to allow the game to air to its conclusion. However, as 7&amp;nbsp;p.m. approached, NBC's [[Telephone switchboard|switchboards]] were jammed by viewers phoning to inquire about the night's schedule, preventing the planned change from being communicated. ''Heidi'' began as scheduled, preempting the final moments of the game and the two Oakland touchdowns in the eastern half of the country, to the outrage of viewers.

Response to the pre-emption by viewers and other critics was negative; the family members of several Jets players were unaware of the game's actual conclusion, while NBC received further criticism for its poor timing in displaying the final score of the game during the ''Heidi'' movie. NBC's president [[Julian Goodman]] formally apologized for the incident. The Jets and Raiders met again in the AFL Championship Game, with the Jets winning 27–23. They later defeated the [[Baltimore Colts]] in [[Super Bowl III]].

In the aftermath of the incident, NBC installed special "''Heidi'' phones", with a connection to a different [[telephone exchange]] from other network phones, to ensure that network personnel could communicate under similar circumstances. The game also had an influence on sports broadcasting practices; the future [[National Football League]] would contractually stipulate that all game telecasts be shown to their conclusion in the markets of the visiting team, while other major leagues and events adopted similar mandates. In 1997, the ''Heidi'' Game was voted the most memorable regular season game in pro football history.

==Background==

===Jets–Raiders rivalry===
{{quote|text = When the Jets played the Raiders, it wasn't a rivalry. It was a war. | sign = Frank Ramos, Director of Public Relations, New York Jets{{sfn|LaMarre|p=64}} }}

The Jets and Raiders were founding members of the [[American Football League]]; both teams began to play in 1960, the Jets under the name Titans of New York.{{sfn|Raiders Historical Highlights}} The two teams had little success in their early years, playing so poorly that both the Titans and Raiders were allowed to draft players from other AFL teams following the [[1962 AFL season|1962 season]].{{sfn|Ryczek|pp=270–271}} In 1967, the Jets, under the guidance of coach [[Weeb Ewbank]] and [[quarterback]] [[Joe Namath]], posted their first winning record at 7–5–2.{{sfn|Sahadi|pp=144–146}}{{efn|Seven wins, five losses, two ties.}} Oakland, on the other hand, won the Western Division in 1967 with a 13–1{{efn|Thirteen wins, one loss.}} mark under coach [[John Rauch]] and then the AFL Championship Game over the [[Houston Oilers]], 40–7, before falling to the [[Green Bay Packers]] in [[Super Bowl II]].{{sfn|Raiders Historical Highlights}} Both teams were seen as likely contenders for the 1968 AFL Championship.{{sfn|Wallace}}

{{quote box | salign = right | quote = Any time we went into a Raiders game, we knew we were gonna come out of it sore. Guaranteed to get the crap beat out of you. They were a rough, physical team.

Downright hatred would be more accurate. | source = —Jets guard [[Randy Rasmussen]]{{sfn|Hanks|p=71}} |align = right | width = 25em }}

The two teams did not play in the same [[division (sport)#Franchise system|division]]. However, each AFL team played all other teams in the league each year, allowing the Raiders and Jets to forge a bitter rivalry.{{sfn|Maynard &amp; Shepatin|p=204}} In 1963, Oakland [[general manager]] (later owner) [[Al Davis]] traded [[guard (American football)|guard]] [[Dan Ficca]] to New York during training camp, without mentioning to Ewbank (who was also the Jets' general manager) that Ficca would not be released from his military service for another six weeks.{{sfn|Ryczek|p=271}} In 1966, with less than a minute to go and the Raiders leading at the new [[Oakland Coliseum]], 28–20, Jets [[left tackle]] [[Winston Hill]] predicted to Namath in the huddle that the man he was blocking, [[Ben Davidson]], would [[Rush (American football)#Defense|rush]] on the next play, leaving the Raiders exposed to a [[draw play]]. Namath called the draw, and handed the ball off to [[running back]] [[Emerson Boozer]] for 47 yards and a [[touchdown]]. After a Jets [[two-point conversion]], the game ended in a 28–28 tie, and an embittered Davidson stated, "I'll get even. They still have to play us next year."{{sfn|Zimmerman}} They did, twice. In Week 4, the Jets defeated the Raiders at [[Shea Stadium]], 27–14; this was the Raiders' only regular season loss.{{sfn|United Press International, January 1, 1968}}{{sfn|Associated Press, October 8, 1967}} In Week 14, each team's 13th game, the teams met again, in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. Sportswriter [[Paul Lionel Zimmerman|Paul Zimmerman]] said of the second 1967 Jets-Raiders game:

{{quote| The 1967 game was one of the most vicious in Jet history. Namath was slugged to the turf; he was hit late, punched in the groin. They aimed for his knees, tried to step on his hands&amp;nbsp;... And Davidson got Namath. He got him on a rollout, with a right that started somewhere between Hayward and Alameda. It knocked Namath's helmet flying, and broke his jaw, but Namath didn't miss a play, and he threw for 370&amp;nbsp;yards and three TD's in that 38–27 loss.{{sfn|Zimmerman}}}}

Davidson stated about his play in the Oakland victory, "I don't think my tackle broke Namath's cheekbone. Not that I care&amp;nbsp;... Namath says that he's been beat up worse by girls. He's asking for it again."&lt;ref name = "nj" /&gt; The Jets loss to the Raiders in 1967 knocked New York out of a tie for first place in their division{{sfn|Valli, November 16, 1967}} – the AFL East was won by the [[Houston Oilers]].{{sfn|Associated Press, December 30, 1967}}

In the [[1968 AFL season|1968 season]], the Jets, Raiders, [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] and [[Kansas City Chiefs]] established themselves as the leading teams. Going into Week 11 of the AFL season, each team had lost only two games; the Chiefs, who had not yet had a [[Bye (sports)|bye week]], had eight wins, the others seven. In an era with no [[Wild card (sports)#National Football League|wild card]] teams, the Raiders needed a victory over the Jets in Week 11 to avoid falling a game and a half behind the Chiefs in the AFL West – finishing second, however good their record, would end their season. The Jets, on the other hand, would clinch at least a tie for the AFL East title with a victory over the Raiders in their only regular season meeting. Depending on the results of other games, the Jets could win the division if they beat the Raiders, gaining the right to host{{efn|At the time, the AFL Championship Game was hosted in alternate years by the champions of the East and West divisions.  In the 1968 season, the AFL East champion would host.}} the AFL Championship Game, the winner of which would play the [[National Football League|NFL]] champion in the [[Super Bowl]].{{sfn|Davis|p=316}} The ill-feeling of previous years was resurrected by an immense blown-up photograph, posted at Raider headquarters, of Davidson smashing Namath in the head. The photographed play was said to have broken the quarterback's jaw (though Namath stated he had broken it on a tough piece of steak, and some claim it was Raiders [[defensive end]] [[Ike Lassiter]] who injured Namath). Although the poster, which had been placed by Davis, was removed before the game, word of this "intimidation through photography" reached the Jets in New York.{{sfn|Strother|pp=90–93}}{{sfn|Anderson}}

Namath, interviewed by reporters, stated that he liked the Raiders the least of any AFL team.&lt;ref name = "nj" /&gt; In 2000, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' sportswriter [[Dave Anderson (sportswriter)|Dave Anderson]] wrote of the Jets' preparations for the Oakland game:

{{quote|When the Jets went to Oakland in 1968, that photo on the Raiders' wall symbolized the rivalry as well as Coach Weeb Ewbank's distrust of Davis. Whenever a helicopter flew anywhere near a Jets practice the week before a game against the Raiders, Ewbank would look up and shake his fist. He just knew Davis had somebody spying on the Jets.{{sfn|Anderson}}}}

The Raiders declined to allow New York reporters to watch practices, a courtesy Ewbank extended to Oakland pressmen. Raiders assistant coach (later head coach) [[John Madden]] was responsible for the exchange of game films with upcoming opponents; he sent the films to the Jets through Chicago so they would arrive a day or two late, reasoning that Davis, not he, would be blamed for the delay. Ewbank blamed Davis for heavily watering the Coliseum field to slow the Jets' speedy receivers, a tactic the Oakland co-owner credited to Madden.{{sfn|Anderson}}

===Game telecast===
NBC's preparations for the Sunday, November 17 game at Oakland were routine. The game was to be televised to most of the country beginning at 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Standard Time, with [[Curt Gowdy]] and [[Al DeRogatis]] announcing. NBC hoped that viewers who tuned their television channel selectors to the game would not walk over to the television and change the channel or turn off the power switch,&lt;!-- note: the language here is intentionally drawn out and clunky to stress the Sixties technology, which is key to the article. Please discuss on talk page before changing. --&gt; but would watch the evening's programming. They anticipated a good game, which would cause the audience to remain in their seats and watch the game in its entirety, "a perfect lead in for the network's special presentation of ''[[Heidi (1968 film)|Heidi]]'', the [[Johanna Spyri]] children's classic, which was scheduled to air after the game at 7&amp;nbsp;p.m. (EST)".{{sfn|Strother|pp=90–93}} The [[television film]] was preempting ''[[Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'', the program normally shown by NBC on Sunday at that time.{{sfn|Hanks|p=68}} As the game started at 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Standard Time]], the western half of the country would have to wait after the game for 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time before seeing ''Heidi''.{{sfn|Garlett|pp=175–178}} Under television rules at the time, the Jets–Raiders game was [[National Football League television blackout policies|blacked out]] within 90 miles of Oakland even though it was a sellout, leaving [[KRON-TV]] (channel 4, the local NBC affiliate serving Oakland at the time), and other NBC affiliates in nearby [[media market|markets]] unable to show the game.{{sfn|Travers|p=114}}

''Heidi'' was heavily promoted by NBC in [[promo (media)|television commercials]] and newspaper advertisements. The network hoped to gain a large audience, especially among families, whom the network anticipated would watch the entire two-hour film. Individual commercials for the film could not be purchased by advertisers; instead, the entire two-hour block was sold by NBC to watch manufacturer [[Timex Group USA|Timex]], which would air the film&lt;!--If you call it a movie, that will be changed by our international people to film, so go with the flow.--&gt; and have its own commercials run during the broadcast.{{sfn|Davis|pp=315–316, 318}} ''The New York Times'' touted ''Heidi'' as the best TV program of the day.{{sfn|Schuster}} Under the terms of the contract between Timex and NBC, ''Heidi'' had to go to air promptly at 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern (6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central]]), and could not be delayed or joined in progress for any reason.{{refn|name=BRewound}}  NBC was inclined to favor the movie over the game, as sponsors like Timex were treated well in hopes of return business, while AFL football's television drawing power was as yet unproven. Dom Cosentino, in his 2014 article on the ''Heidi'' Game, points out the irony that Timex, a watch company, was the sponsor; the game would become infamous for its telecast, cut short because of time.&lt;ref name = "nj" /&gt;

Steven Travers, in his history of the Raiders, noted:

{{quote|That Sunday evening at 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. the family classic ''Heidi'' was scheduled. This is the well-known story of a little Swiss girl who lives with her grandfather in the [Alps], a staple of wholesome entertainment. In the days before [[cable television|cable]], [[pay-per-view]], [[VHS]], [[DVD]], [[TiVo]], record, rewind, and 700 channels – when the choices came down to what NBC, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], and maybe a handful of local stations wanted to show the public, TV viewers scheduled their days around events like ''Heidi''. It was on once a year. If one missed it, they missed it until the next year.{{sfn|Travers|p=115}}}}

The nerve center for NBC was known as Broadcast Operations Control (BOC). Dick Cline, the network BOC supervisor for sports telecasts, prepared the series of network orders which would result in the game running as scheduled, followed by ''Heidi''. Cline had no reason to believe that the game would run over three hours; no professional football game presented by NBC ever had. However, other NBC executives stressed that ''Heidi'' must start as scheduled. NBC president [[Julian Goodman]] told his executives before the weekend that the well-sponsored, well-promoted film must start on time. [[NBC Sports]] [[executive producer]] Don "Scotty" Connal took care to tell the game producer, Don Ellis, that ''Heidi'' must start at 7:00 in the East, over Ellis' objection that he had been trained never to leave a game in progress. Connal told Ellis that NBC had sold the time, and was obligated to switch to the film.{{sfn|Davis|pp=317–318}}

NBC ran three BOCs, in [[Burbank, California]], Chicago, and New York City, with the last the largest. Cline was stationed at the New York BOC for the game. In the era before [[satellite transmission]], programming was transmitted by [[coaxial cable]] line, with the cooperation of the telephone company&lt;!--which one?  even back then, there were different companies--&gt;. For this game, the Burbank BOC was to receive the feed from Oakland, insert commercials and network announcements, and send the modified feed via telephone wire to a switching station west of Chicago near the [[Mississippi River]]. An engineer was stationed there to activate the Oakland feed into the entire network when the game began, to cut it on instruction and then to return to his base. He had been told to expect at 6:58:20 Eastern Time&lt;!--The time, of course, was an hour earlier for him, as he was in the Central Time Zone, a fact not worth mentioning. These things are routine in television.--&gt; a network announcement for ''Heidi'', after which he was to cut the feed from Burbank, and the ''Heidi'' feed from New York would begin. This placed Burbank in effective control of whether the engineer would cut the feed, since he would act upon hearing the announcement.{{sfn|Davis|pp=315–316}}

Connal, Cline's boss, was available in case of trouble, watching from his home in [[Connecticut]]. His superior, NBC Sports [[vice president]] [[Chet Simmons]], who alternated weekends with Connal as on-call in the event of difficulties, was also watching from his [[Manhattan]] home. NBC president Goodman and NBC Sports head Carl Lindemann also turned on the game, which was expected to be exciting, in their [[New York metropolitan area|New York area]] homes.{{sfn|Davis|pp=317, 319}} The [[Buffalo Bills]]–San Diego Chargers game, shown as the first of a network [[Doubleheader (television)|doubleheader]], was running long in its 2½-hour time slot, and NBC unhesitatingly cut its ending to go to the Jets and Raiders.{{sfn|Clary|pp=131–133}}{{sfn|''New York Times'', November 16, 1968}}

On the opening kickoff, the Jets were penalized for a [[personal foul (football)|personal foul]] against the Raiders. The Jets took an early 6–0 lead on 44-yard and 18-yard [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goals]] made by [[Placekicker|kicker]] [[Jim Turner (placekicker)|Jim Turner]]. The Raiders, led by quarterback [[Daryle Lamonica]], who had been battling recent back and knee injuries, scored the game's first touchdown, taking a 7–6 lead on a 22-yard pass to receiver [[Warren Wells]] towards the end of the first quarter. The Raiders added to their lead when Lamonica threw a 48-yard pass to [[tight end]] [[Billy Cannon]] at the beginning of the second quarter.{{sfn|Strother|pp=90–93}}{{refn|name=drive}}

However, the Jets cut into Oakland's lead when Namath drove the offense 73 yards down field and ran the ball in for a 1-yard touchdown with five seconds remaining in the first half. The Jets lined up as if to kick the extra point, but holder and backup quarterback [[Babe Parilli]] tried to complete a two-point conversion pass, which fell incomplete. The Raiders led the Jets 14–12 at [[halftime]].{{sfn|Strother|pp=90–93}}{{refn|name=drive}}{{sfn|Sahadi|p=182}}&lt;!--Accounts differ as to whether or not it was a bad snap or a premeditated fake kick.--&gt;

Approximately five minutes into the third quarter, Namath forged another Jets drive, following an [[interception]] by safety [[Jim Hudson]], that ended with halfback [[Bill Mathis]] scoring a 4-yard touchdown behind blocking guard [[Dave Herman (American football)|Dave Herman]] to give New York a 19–14 lead. The Raiders responded with an 80-yard drive that saw running back [[Charlie Smith (running back)|Charlie Smith]] score his first touchdown of the game on a 3-yard pass from Lamonica. The Raiders took a 22–19 lead on a two-point conversion with Lamonica completing the attempt to receiver [[Hewritt Dixon]].{{sfn|Strother|pp=90–93}}{{refn|name=drive}} During this drive, Hudson was ejected from the game after being called for a face mask penalty followed by a dispute with an official. As he left the field, he gave the jeering crowd [[Finger (gesture)|the finger]]. The penalties caused the ball to be placed at the Jets' 3-yard line, and Smith scored for Oakland one play later.{{sfn|Strother|pp=90–93}}

The fourth quarter began with Smith fumbling the football with Oakland in scoring position. New York defensive end [[Gerry Philbin]] recovered the football at the Jets' 3-yard line setting up a 97-yard drive, consisting entirely of two Namath passes to [[Don Maynard]], who was covered by Raiders' rookie cornerback [[George Atkinson (American football)|George Atkinson]]. The 50-yard touchdown pass followed a 47-yard throw, and gave the Jets a 26–22 lead. Turner added another field goal to the Jets' total, giving them a 29–22 lead. The Raiders promptly responded with Lamonica orchestrating an 88-yard drive that ended with a 22-yard pass to receiver [[Fred Biletnikoff]] with less than four minutes remaining in the game, tying the contest.{{sfn|Strother|pp=90–93}}{{refn|name=drive}}

{{quote box | salign = right | quote = I would have outrun Hudson, too. The play that was called back was a circle pattern, but teams were getting wise to that. So on the touchdown, I ran to the hash mark on the right side and then broke to the sideline. That play was open all day, but Daryle told me to be patient, that we would get to it. Our wide receivers ran deep patterns to clear out the secondary and then I just cut underneath.|source= —Raiders running back [[Charlie Smith (running back)|Charlie Smith]]{{sfn|LaMarre|p=59}} | align = right | width = 30em }}

Turner made a 26-yard field goal to break the tie and give the Jets a three-point lead with a little over a minute remaining in the game. Turner kicked the ball off to the Raiders' Smith, who took the kick out of the [[end zone]] and to Oakland's own 22-yard line. Lamonica completed to Smith for an apparent touchdown, but the play was called back due to a penalty, causing New York cornerback [[Johnny Sample]] to say to Lamonica, "Nice try, Lamonica. Better luck next year."{{sfn|LaMarre|p=58}} On first down, Smith caught a 20-yard reception from Lamonica, while a 15-yard penalty was assessed against the Jets when a player grabbed Smith's facemask, moving the ball to the Jets' 43-yard line. On the ensuing play, Lamonica threw another pass to Smith who outpaced Jets safety [[Mike D'Amato (American football)|Mike D'Amato]], who replaced the ejected Jim Hudson, for a 43-yard touchdown. Kicker [[George Blanda]] made the extra point attempt which gave the Raiders a 36–32 lead.{{sfn|Strother|pp=90–93}}{{refn|name=drive}}

With 42 seconds remaining, the Jets still had a chance to score; however, on the kickoff, New York [[Kickoff returner|return man]] [[Earl Christy]] [[fumble]]d the ball at the Jets' 12-yard line when he was tackled by Raiders linebacker [[Bill Budness]]. Oakland reserve running back [[Preston Ridlehuber]] picked up the fumbled ball and ran into the end zone, which with another Blanda extra point gave the Raiders a 43–32 lead, deflating any hopes of the Jets coming back to win the contest. Ridlehuber could not remember whether AFL rules permitted advancing a fumbled kickoff return (they did), so tried to make it appear he was entering the end zone with the same motion he gathered in the ball. Oakland kicked off to New York again, but it could do little with the ball in the final seconds, and the game ended.{{sfn|Strother|pp=90–93}}{{refn|name=drive}}

===Decision to leave the game for ''Heidi''===
The two starting quarterbacks combined for 31 incomplete passes, with the clock stopping on each incompletion, and the officials called 19 penalties, leading to more clock stoppages.{{sfn|Schuster}} Each team used all six of its allocated timeouts, and the many scores led to additional commercial breaks.{{sfn|Davis|pp=318–319}} At halftime, Connal called Cline, and without urgency discussed the fact that the game seemed to be running longer than expected.{{sfn|Davis|p=317}}

As the fourth quarter began, it was 6:20 EST,{{refn|name=drive}}&lt;!--Official statistical sheets say the 4th quarter took 47 minutes to play, and we know the game ended at 7:07.--&gt; and NBC executives began to realize the game might not end by 7:00. NBC Sports vice president Chet Simmons recalled:

{{quote|They kept promoting ''Heidi'', kept promoting ''Heidi''. I kept looking at my watch, and I said to myself, there's no way to me that ''Heidi''{{'}}s going to make this at seven o'clock. Julian Goodman, the president of the company, told us going into the weekend that ''Heidi'' had to start on time&amp;nbsp;... I looked at my watch, looked at another table clock, looked at the game, and thought, no way is this going to happen.{{sfn|Davis|pp=318–319}}}}

Connal, watching the game from his home in [[Old Greenwich, Connecticut]], also noticed the fourth quarter was running "terribly slow".{{refn|name=BRewound}} At 6:45, he called Cline again, and both men agreed the game would not end on time. Both supported running the end of the game, but given Goodman's instructions, his permission was required. Connal agreed to call NBC Sports president Lindemann, and that he and Lindemann would then speak to Goodman. After promising Cline a return call, Connal reached Lindemann by telephone. Lindemann agreed that the end of the game should be broadcast, and both men began trying to reach Goodman. Lindemann was successful in reaching Goodman, and asked the network president, "What about the instruction to broadcast operations control that ''Heidi'' had to go on at 7:00 ET, no matter what?"{{sfn|Rappoport|p=87}} Goodman replied, "That's crazy. It's a terrible idea."{{sfn|Rappoport|p=87}} Lindemann then set up a three-way conversation with himself, Goodman and NBC Television president Don Durgin. After several minutes of discussion, Durgin agreed to delay the start of ''Heidi'' until after the game was completed.{{refn|name=BRewound}} Sportswriter Kyle Garlett, in his history of sports gaffes, noted, "And even though earlier executives had told [Cline] to make sure he started ''Heidi'' on time, those same executives changed their minds late in the game."{{sfn|Garlett|pp=175–178}}

Cline, watching the clock nervously, attempted to call Connal back, only to find both lines busy. He waited as long as he could, then made one final, unsuccessful attempt. Unknown to Cline, Connal was talking to Goodman, who had agreed to "slide the network", that is, start ''Heidi'' as soon as Curt Gowdy signed off from the game. Connal called the game producer, Ellis, in Oakland, to tell him the news, then called the BOC supervisor in Burbank – who, not knowing Connal, refused his order, and insisted on speaking with Goodman directly. As Goodman had disconnected to allow Connal to call Oakland, this could not be done.{{sfn|Davis|pp=321–325}}

Beginning about 6:45, many members of the public began calling NBC network and affiliate switchboards. Some demanded the game be shown to its conclusion; others wanted to know if ''Heidi'' would start on time. These calls jammed the switchboards, and even blew repeated fuses in them, preventing the executives from getting through to each other to resolve the situation. NBC protocol required an operations order from Connal, to countermand the midweek written orders, but Cline received no call from the increasingly desperate Connal, who was frustrated by the switchboard issues. Without such an order, and not knowing of Goodman's approval, Cline made the decision that ''Heidi'' would start on time.{{sfn|Davis|pp=321–323}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC Chief faced 'Heidi Bowl' wrath (obituary for Julian Goodman)|author=Matt Schudel|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Media Group|The Washington Post Company]]|date=July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television audience saw Smith return Turner's kickoff out of the end zone to the Oakland 22-yard line with 1:01 remaining. Burbank BOC played the closing football theme and gave the word cue, to the outraged shock of Ellis and Connal, and the connection was irretrievably broken. Although the western United States continued to view the game, the eastern half of the nation instead saw a little girl on a Swiss mountain and was unaware that Oakland was in the course of scoring two touchdowns to win the game.{{sfn|Davis|pp=321–323}}

''[[Oakland Tribune]]'' reporter Bob Valli reported on the ''Heidi'' Game: "Television missed one of football's most exciting and exhausting minutes of emotion. In that minute, Oakland fans saw despair turn to delirium."{{sfn|Valli, November 18, 1968}}

==Reaction and aftermath==

===Viewer reaction===
On realizing that NBC was switching away from the game, Goodman said to Lindemann by phone, "Where the hell has our football game gone?"{{sfn|Rappoport|p=89}} During the [[station break]] which began with the network announcement, Goodman called a BOC phone to which only he knew the number and which was not part of NBC's CIrcle-7&lt;!--It is not an error that both the C and the I are capitalized, that is how telephone exchanges were designated, for example PEnnsylvania-6, or FLanders-1 --&gt; exchange (which blew a fuse 26 times in an hour).{{sfn|Davis|pp=323–324}} When Cline answered it, Goodman ordered him to go back to the game. Although Cline knew there was no way to reconnect the feed, he promised to do the best he could.{{sfn|Davis|pp=323–324}} By the time the game ended at 7:07, thousands of viewers were calling the network to complain about missing the end of the football game. Others called newspapers, [[television station]]s, even the [[New York City Police Department]], both to seek the final score, and simply to vent.{{sfn|Clary|pp=131–133}} Humorist [[Art Buchwald]] wrote "Men who wouldn't get out of their chairs in an earthquake rushed to the phone to scream obscenities [at the network]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Showing of 'Heidi' sacked NFL and fans in '68|author=Dick Heller|newspaper=[[Washington Times]]|date=November 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; As people learned of the outcome, some became upset because Ridlehuber's touchdown meant the Raiders had won by more than the point spread of 7{{frac|1|2}}, and bets thought to be won were now lost.&lt;ref name = "nj" /&gt; In Oakland, Gowdy and DeRogatis left the broadcast booth to tell Ellis that the final two minutes were the most exciting they had ever seen. Ellis replied, "It's too bad America didn't see it."{{refn|name=eagle}} Realizing that the original call had been lost, Ellis had the two sportscasters re-create their descriptions of the two Raider touchdowns on tape.{{refn|name=eagle}}

In an attempt to inform the audience of the game's outcome, NBC displayed the message "SPORTS BULLETIN: RAIDERS DEFEAT JETS 43-32" as an on-screen news update during the film. It did so during a scene just as Heidi's paralyzed cousin Clara was taking her first, slow steps. According to sportswriter Jack Clary, "The football fans were indignant when they saw what they had missed. The ''Heidi'' audience was peeved at having an ambulatory football score intrude on one of the story's more touching moments. Short of pre-empting ''Heidi'' for a skin flick, NBC could not have managed to alienate more viewers that evening."{{sfn|Clary|pp=131–133}}

At 8:30, Goodman issued a statement apologizing for the incident, and stating that he had missed the ending of the game "as much as anybody".{{sfn|Clary|pp=131–133}} He stated that it was "a forgivable error committed by humans who were concerned about children expecting to see ''Heidi''".{{sfn|Clary|pp=131–133}} The following morning, Cline was called into a meeting with his bosses. He was told that if he had done anything other than what he did, NBC would have been at the mercy of Timex and Cline would have been fired.{{sfn|Davis|p=325}} The network turned the fiasco into an advantage by subsequent self-mockery, promoting the following week's Jets game telecast with an advertisement showing Namath with Heidi on his shoulders, and running another ad with testimonials about ''Heidi'', the last: "I didn't get a chance to see it, but I hear it was great", signed by Namath.{{sfn|Davis|p=325}}&lt;!-- The quote in the source is not correct. It was corrected after an editor viewed the EL to the Raiders site and saw the ad at about the 3:10 mark. --&gt; Other networks joined in: on the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' the following Monday night (November 18), [[Harry Reasoner]] announced the "result" of the game: "Heidi married the goat-herder".{{sfn|Garlett|pp=175–178}} That same evening, NBC's own ''[[Huntley-Brinkley Report]]'' aired the tape of the game's final minute, complete with the re-created Gowdy/DeRogatis commentary.{{refn|name=globe}} On the ''[[ABC World News Tonight|ABC Evening News]]'', anchor [[Frank Reynolds]] read excerpts from ''Heidi'' while clips of the Raiders' two touchdowns were shown as cut-ins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 10: TV commercial sporting howlers|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/top10/4523417/Top-10-TV-commercial-sporting-howlers.html|author=Rod Gilmour|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramifications===
To prevent similar occurrences happening in future game telecasts, a special "''Heidi'' phone", a hotline connected to a different exchange and unaffected by switchboard meltdowns, was installed in BOC.{{refn|name=eagle}} The network quickly changed its procedures to allow games to finish before other programming begins,{{sfn|Clary|pp=131–133}} which is now standard practice.{{refn|name=eagle}} Three weeks after the ''Heidi'' Game, NBC aired a special presentation of ''[[Pinocchio (1968 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (a live-action version starring [[Peter Noone]], the lead singer of the rock band [[Herman's Hermits]], in the title role). In the promotional newspaper advertisement for the film, [[Pinocchio]] himself assured football fans that they would view the entire game before the film and that he would sooner cut off his nose than "have them cut off" the action.{{sfn|Hanks|p=70|loc=the ad read: "Pinocchio says, I'd rather cut off my nose than have them cut off any of today's AFL action"}} On December 15, the nationally televised game between the Raiders and the [[San Diego Chargers]] ran over its allotted time slot. NBC started ''[[The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (the usual program airing at 7 p.m. EST) at 7:08 Eastern, and announced that all network programming that evening would be started eight minutes late. "I can't remember when we've done anything like this before", stated an NBC executive.{{sfn|Associated Press, December 16, 1968}} "It's very unusual."{{sfn|Associated Press, December 16, 1968}}

In subsequent television contracts, the [[AFL–NFL merger|merged NFL]] required language which obligated the networks to show games to completion in the road team's television market.{{sfn|LaMarre|p=61}} Other major professional sports leagues in North America, the [[NCAA]], and even the [[International Olympic Committee]] also shared the same rule in regards to their own respective TV contracts.{{sfn|LaMarre|p=61}} On November 23, 1975, NBC planned to air the heavily promoted children's film ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'' at 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern, right after a game between the Raiders and [[Washington Redskins]]. When the game went into [[overtime]], NBC stayed with it for almost 45&amp;nbsp;minutes and then joined the ''Wonka'' film in progress, prompting angry calls from parents.{{sfn|Clary|pp=131–133}}

Cline stated in 1989, "I wonder if this ''Heidi'' thing will ever die&amp;nbsp;... maybe now that it's past 20 years people will stop asking me about it."{{sfn|Hanks|p=70}} In 1997 the ''Heidi'' Game  was voted among the ten most memorable games in pro football history, and the most memorable regular season contest.{{sfn|Travers|p=118}} In 2005, ''[[TV Guide]]'' designated the ''Heidi'' Game at #6 on its list of the "100 Most Unexpected TV Moments" in history. Interviewed by the magazine, [[Jennifer Edwards]], title star of ''Heidi'', commented: "My gravestone is gonna say, 'She was a great moment in sports.'"{{refn|name=Edelstein December 5, 2005}}

Cline summed up the events of the ''Heidi'' Game:

{{quote|Everything had to be perfect. It was just a series of events that fit together. The game ran late, there was a lot of scoring; there were some injuries that stopped play. And if the Jets had won, there would not have been the to-do that was made. But the way they lost fanned the fires.{{refn|name=eagle}}}}

===Game aftermath===
The Jets were enraged by the outcome of the game, for reasons unrelated to the television problems, of which they were initially unaware. Feeling that Hudson's disqualification was unjustified (his replacement, D'Amato, was beaten for the winning touchdown), assistant coach [[Walt Michaels]] chased after the officials, and he and team doctor [[James Nicholas]] banged on the door of their dressing room, complaining bitterly. Ewbank mentioned the officiating in his postgame [[press conference]].{{sfn|Strother|pp=90–93}} When told of Michaels' actions, the head coach ordered, "Get him out of there, it can only cost him money."{{refn|name=sullen}} Oakland coach Rauch told reporters, "There were so many turning points which kept putting both teams back in the game, it's impossible to discuss them all."{{sfn|Valli, November 18, 1968}}

Ewbank learned of the television problems in the locker room when he received a telephone call from his wife congratulating him on a Jets victory – Lucy Ewbank assumed the fact that the end of the game was not shown meant New York had won. Her husband profanely informed her of the game result.{{sfn|Davis|p=324}} She was not the only Jets relative deceived – cornerback Johnny Sample flew back east after the game on personal business, and when his father picked him up at [[Philadelphia International Airport]], he congratulated his son on a Jets triumph.{{sfn|Hanks|pp=67–68}}

Michaels accused Al Davis of getting the officials to inspect Turner's kicking shoes before a field goal attempt to see if they contained illegal metal plates, and called the Oakland team official "a man who has never contributed anything to football", to which Davis responded, "It's utterly ridiculous, unbelievable. It seems the Jets always lose to us because of penalties. But I like them and don't want any feud in case we visit New York December 29 [if both teams qualify for the AFL Championship Game]."{{sfn|Usher, November 19, 1968}} The Jets left their white road uniforms in Oakland to be laundered and sent to them in San Diego, where they were to play their next game. The uniforms were not seen again once the team removed them in the Oakland locker room, and Jets management hastily ordered the green home uniforms, as well as the white uniforms the team had worn in the preseason, to be shipped from New York.{{sfn|''New York Times'', November 23, 1968}}

While in California, Michaels complained by phone to [[Mel Hein]], AFL supervisor of officials, stating that an official had cursed at Hudson, provoking a response which led to Hudson's ejection.{{sfn|Usher, November 19, 1968}} Jets officials also showed excerpts from [[NFL Films|the game films]] to the sportswriters from the New York papers who were assigned to cover the team. Zimmerman, who wrote for the ''[[New York Post]]'', later stated, "I never saw such ferocity on a football field in my life" and remembered that the films showed Oakland defensive lineman [[Dan Birdwell]] punch Namath in the groin, causing him to remain on the ground for several minutes, though he did not have to leave the game. Birdwell's action was not penalized by the game officials.{{sfn|Hanks|p=71}} In early December, football Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] fined the Jets $2,000, Michaels $150, Hudson $200 (including a mandatory $50 fine for being ejected from the game), and Jets player [[John Elliott (defensive lineman)|John Elliott]], also disqualified, $50;{{sfn|Usher, November 19, 1968}}{{sfn|Usher, December 4, 1968}} he had hit Oakland [[Center (Gridiron football)|center]] [[Jim Otto]]. Rozelle criticized Ewbank and Michaels for their "extreme bad manners" while criticizing the officials&lt;ref name = "nj" /&gt; and cited the Jets' screening of the game excerpts as a factor contributing to the team's fine.{{sfn|Hanks|p=71}} To avoid adverse fan reaction, the AFL reassigned [[field judge]] Frank Kirkland, whom Hudson had accused of using foul language, from the December 1 Jets game against the [[Miami Dolphins]] at Shea Stadium, to another game.{{sfn|Fox}}

The Jets defeated San Diego 37–15 and clinched the AFL East four days later when the second-place [[History of the Houston Oilers|Oilers]] lost to the Chiefs in a [[Thanksgiving Day]] game.{{sfn|Sahadi|p=184}} The Raiders finished tied for the AFL West title with Kansas City; they then defeated the Chiefs in a tie-breaking playoff game. This set up a December 29 rematch between the Jets and Raiders in the AFL Championship.{{sfn|Associated Press, December 25, 1968}}

The Jets hosted the Raiders at [[Shea Stadium]] on a windy December afternoon to determine who would play in [[Super Bowl III]] against the NFL champions, who proved to be the [[Baltimore Colts]].{{sfn|Namath|p=179}} The Jets defeated the Raiders, 27–23.{{sfn|LaMarre|pp=55–57}} Two weeks later, the Jets defeated the Colts in the Super Bowl. According to sportswriter Doyle Dietz, in the Jets' upset victory (the Colts were [[spread betting|favored by]] as many as 19½ points), "the American Football League came of age".{{refn|name=Deitz January 20, 1980}} Madden later stated that the Jets' Super Bowl upset "was great for the history of the game, but a part of me has always felt that should have been [the Raiders] who were the first AFL team to do it ... [Super Bowl III] changed pro football. But I will always believe we would have beaten the Colts, too."{{sfn|LaMarre|pp=52–53}}

In 1988, Namath and Madden, by then both television analysts, were interviewed for the 20th anniversary of the ''Heidi'' Game. According to Madden, the Oakland victory in the ''Heidi'' Game "was kind of the start of the Raiders being a great team. One of the things we were doing was getting these fantastic come-from-behind things&amp;nbsp;... We didn't even know about the ''Heidi'' thing until we read about it the next day."{{sfn|Shuster}} Namath noted, "When I remember that game, it brings to mind the revenge factor we had against them going into the championship game. We paid them back then", to which Madden chuckled, "He's full of crap."{{sfn|Shuster}}

'''''Hun lakhon lek''''' (or ''Hun lakorn lek'') is a type of traditional small Thai [[puppet]] which uses three [[puppeteers]] working together to produce a character with more mobility and lifelike movement.

== History ==

''Hun la korn lek'' has been a form of entertainment for the [[Thai people]] and foreigners alike for more than a century. It was invented by [[Kru Krae Suppawanich]] in 1901 during the reign of [[King Mongkut]] (King Rama IV). He developed it while trying to construct a [[Hun Laung]] (Royal Thai puppet), which he found involved too many complicated structures and too many strings. He decreased the number of the strings inside the puppet, and thus invented ''hun la korn lek''. His first performance was in [[Varadis Palace]].

Kru Kare continued performing with his puppets, but after [[World War II]] he found he was growing older, and that ''hun la korn lek'' was beginning to decrease in popularity. He passed 30 of his puppets onto his daughter-in-law, and the rest of his puppets were "drowned" in the [[Chao Phraya River]]. Later on, his daughter-in-law passed the remaining puppets on to [[Sakorn Yang-keawsot]] (English nickname Joe Louis) because of his ability in performing with the puppets. ''Hun la korn lek'' was brought back to the public eye by the ministry of culture at the celebration of the 200th anniversary of [[Bangkok]] in 1985, and has been publicly performed continuously ever since.

== Construction of the puppets ==
1.	All the structures and head are molded from clay to generate a character with a human-like appearance.

2.	These clay pieces are covered with paper and allowed to dry in the sun.

3.	Arms and legs are made from fabric which is filled with cotton. Wooden foldable joints are attached so limbs have a lifelike movement.

4.	Hands and feet are carved from [[Thong Lang]] wood, a wood which is lightweight and carves easily.

5.	The pieces are painted.

6.	Costumes are made using handmade cloth and sewed by hand according to traditional Thai sewing methods.

7.	The face of the puppet is painted with colored clay to match the color of human skin. Eyes and lips are painted with poster paint.

== Performance technique ==
To perform ''Hun la korn lek'', three puppeteers are each responsible for different functions. They need to have a thorough knowledge of basic [[Khon]] dance, and a lot of practice and teamwork are required for the three of them to perform together as one character. The first puppeteer controls the head and the right hand of the puppet. The second puppeteer controls the left hand of the puppet. The third puppeteer controls the feet of the puppet. They must be skillful and experienced enough to control every part in unison to produce a perfectly coordinated character.

== Story ==
''Hun la korn lek'' performances generally involve renditions of Thai Royal novels and traditional Thai novels, mainly [[Ramakein]] and [[Sang Thong]]. The play does not generally involve a performance of the whole story from beginning to end, but only one chosen part of the story which is divided into three acts. The story may be told in its original version or rearranged by the composer.

'''''Jus' Like That! A Night Out with Tommy Cooper''''' is a stage comedy and entertainment show featuring various comedians and actors as [[Tommy Cooper]]. Written by [[John Fisher]] and directed by [[Patrick Ryecart]], it appeared at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] among others on tour. In 2010, [[Clive Mantle]] portrayed Cooper, and others such as [[Jim Davidson]] have also done so.

==Background==
In order to train for the role, [[Clive Mantle]] mastered many of Cooper's magic tricks, studying under [[Geoffrey Durham]] for several months.&lt;ref name="SWE0410"/&gt; Mantle was thrilled to take on the role as Cooper is his ultimate comic hero, saying "It's such a big privilege playing Tommy - I genuinely love the man. He is one of the funniest comedians this country has ever produced.

The show received considerable critical acclaim.

''[[The South Wales Echo]]'' called it a "compelling, funny and moving play" and said " Clive, best known for his role as Dr Mike Barratt in Casualty, has had to get used to wearing a fez and conjuring up some magic for his title role of Jus' Like That!

'''''Kickboxer: Retaliation''''' is an American [[martial arts film]] directed and written by [[Dimitri Logothetis]]. It is the seventh film in the [[Kickboxer (film series)|''Kickboxer'' franchise]] and is a direct sequel to the 2016 film ''[[Kickboxer: Vengeance]]'', also written by Logothetis. The film stars [[Alain Moussi]], [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], [[Christopher Lambert]], [[Ronaldinho]], [[Mike Tyson]] and [[Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson]]. Aside from Moussi and Van Damme, [[Sara Malakul Lane]] and Sam Medina reprised their roles from the previous film.

==Plot==
It has been eighteen months since Kurt Sloane killed Tong Po and avenged the death of his brother Eric. Now a professional mixed martial artist, Kurt defeats [[Renato Sobral]] using a move he calls the "Hurricane Armbar", a [[hurricanrana]] into an armbar. Kurt has been plagued by nightmares where he and his wife Liu are on a train and he finds himself fighting on the train which ends with him falling into water and possibly drowning. After the fight, Kurt is met by two U.S. Marshals who inform him that he must return to Thailand to be implicated in the death of Tong Po. When Kurt asks to see one of the Marshal's badges, he is tasered. 

Awakening in a prison in Thailand, Kurt meets Thomas Tang Moore, the mastermind behind the underground tournament where Kurt, Eric, and Tong Po have competed. Moore tells Kurt that when Tong Po was defeated, he was to remain there as the new champion, but instead with Kurt returning home, Moore needed to find a new champion. Moore offers Kurt to fight the new champion, Mongkut, a 6'8" 400-lb. fighter. Kurt finds himself taunted by Crawford, Tong Po's former right hand man who is working for Moore. Moore offers Kurt $1 million to fight Mongkut, but Kurt refuses. Stuck in prison, Kurt finds himself under constant threat from various prisoners, in which he then finds himself whipped by the prison guards each night. During one encounter, Kurt runs into Briggs, an American boxer who soon bonds with Kurt and even offers him a way to go through the pain from the whippings. Kurt also soon learns that his Muay Thai teacher, Durand, is now training some of the prisoners, but reveals that for his troubles, he has been blinded.

Moore, realizing Kurt still will not accept the offer, decides to take drastic measures and finds Liu at the train station. Having bribed the same police officers she had accused of corruption to find Kurt, she gets additional help from old friend Gamon. However, Moore's goons, led by Somsak, have kidnapped Liu and that night, Crawford shows Kurt a video of Liu. Kurt decides to take the fight with Durand, Briggs, and fellow prisoners Big Country, Fabricio, Ronaldo, and a huge convict whose size nearly matches that of Mongkut. When Moore offers to take Kurt out of prison and in a private facility, Kurt agrees but only if his "team" continues their training and Moore agrees. Durand goes to one of Mongkut's training sessions only to learn the fighter is a product of bioengineering by Ivy League graduate Rupert, who has developed a combination of adrenaline and steroids, thus making Mongkut virtually invincible except for one small weakness: a glass jaw. Gamon joins in on the training and Kurt recognizes Somsak. Moore talks to Crawford about a test fight, to which Moore agrees and Kurt goes to a local nightclub where he and Durand once again meet Joseph King, whose last fighter decimated Kurt. Kurt faces King's new champion Moss while Durand distracts an onlooker and steals his cell phone to call his son Travis. Kurt defeats Moss and make a narrow escape with the help of Travis. 

The next day, Kurt finds Somsak and chases him. After fighting more of Moore's men, Kurt catches up to Somsak and demands to know where Liu is. Liu is being held in Moore's apartment. Kurt, Gamon, and Travis take on Moore's men with Kurt facing Moore's two female valets in a room full of mirrors only to defeat them, finding Liu and rescuing her. When O'Keefe, Moore's right hand man, leads an ambush to stop the group, Mongkut arrives. He is about to hit Kurt when Liu steps in and Mongkut hits her hard in the stomach, knocking her unconscious. An angry Kurt tells Crawford to tell Moore he will face Mongkut anytime and anywhere. Liu is comatose in the hospital for a few days until she wakes up and learns Kurt has taken the fight. She fully accepts his decision. 

The fight is set at the old Muay Thai temple with both Kurt and Mongkut ready to fight. Mongkut proves to be too much for Kurt and mid-way through, Mongkut throws Kurt to a statue, virtually killing him. When it is believed that Kurt has died from his injuries, Liu finds Rupert's suitcase of adrenaline and uses a needle to revive Kurt. Awakening, Kurt finds a second wind and despite getting some of the upper hand, Mongkut once again throws Kurt towards a statue and this time, takes him to a nearby fountain to drown him. Kurt imagines himself once again drowning as he did in his dream, but overhears the voices of Liu and Durand, prompting him to "swim out". Kurt grabs a chain and wraps it around his fist, enabling him to match Mongkut punch for punch. Using his skills, Kurt gets the upper hand and knocks Mongkut out. When Mongkut comes back up, Kurt resorts to taking Mongkut down with the chain, wrapping it around his neck and choking him out, resulting in Mongkut's neck breaking. Kurt has won and is surrounded by Durand, Liu, Gamon, and Travis. Hearing the news that Kurt has beaten Mongkut, Briggs is seen smiling in his prison cell.

An end credit sequence shows outtakes, following by an epilogue of Kurt once again in the MMA ring as he prepares for his next fight against [[Mauricio Rua]].

A '''knight-errant'''&lt;ref&gt;As plural, ''knights-errant'' is most common, although the form ''knights-errants'' is also seen, e.g. in the article ''Graal'' in James O. Halliwell, ''Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words'' (1847).&lt;/ref&gt; (or '''knight errant''', without the hyphen&lt;ref&gt;"Knight errant." ''The Canadian Oxford Dictionary''. Ed. Barber, Katherine: Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a figure of medieval [[chivalry|chivalric]] [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance literature]]. The adjective ''[[:wikt:errant|errant]]'' (meaning "wandering, roving") indicates how the knight-errant would wander the land in search of adventures to prove his [[chivalry|chivalric]] virtues, either in [[knight]]ly duels ([[pas d'armes]]) or in some other pursuit of [[courtly love]].

==Description==
The knight errant is a character that has broken away from the world of his origin, in order to go off on his own to right wrongs or to test and assert his own chivalric ideals.  He is motivated by idealism and goals that are often illusory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pHypAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=knight+errant+gawain&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj414WEtpLdAhWotVkKHatYAUkQ6AEIVDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=knight%20errant%20gawain&amp;f=false ] McGilchrist, Megan Riley.  “The Ties that Bind”. Monk, Nicholas, editor. ''Intertextual and Interdisciplinary Approaches to Cormac McCarthy: Borders and Crossings.'' Routledge, 2012. p. 24. {{ISBN|9781136636066}}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval Europe, knight-errantry existed in literature, though fictional works from this time often were presented as [[non-fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Eisenberg, "The Pseudo-Historicity of the Romances of Chivalry", ''Quaderni Ibero-Americani'', 45–46, 1974–75, pp. 253–259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/historicalviewl02roscgoog] [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]], ''Historical View of the Literatures of the South of Europe'', trans. Thomas Roscoe, 4th edition, London, 1885-88, Vol. I, pp. 76-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The template of the knight-errant were the heroes of the [[Round Table]] of the [[Arthurian cycle]] such as [[Gawain]], [[Lancelot]] and [[Percival]]. The [[quest]] ''par excellence'' in pursuit of which these knights wandered the lands is that of the [[Holy Grail]], such as in ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'' written by [[Chrétien de Troyes]] in the 1180s.

The character of the wandering knight existed in romantic literature as it developed during the late 12th century. However, the term "knight-errant" was to come later; its first extant usage occurs in the 14th-century poem ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Gawain arrives at the castle of Sir Bercilak de Haudesert after long journeys, and Sir Bercilak goes to welcome the "knygt erraunt." [http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20010328 The Maven's Word of the Day: Knight Errant]&lt;/ref&gt;
Knight-errantry tales remained popular with [[courtier|courtly]] audiences throughout the [[Late Middle Ages]]. They were written in [[Middle French]], in [[Middle English]] and in [[Middle Low German|Middle German]]. In the 16th century, the genre became highly popular in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]; ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'' was one of the most successful knight-errantry tales of this period. In ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605), [[Cervantes]] [[burlesque]]d the romances and their popularity. Tales of knight-errantry then fell out of fashion for two centuries, until they re-emerged in the form of the [[historical novel]] in [[Romanticism]].

==Romance==
{{further|Romance (heroic literature)|Chivalry}}
[[File:Yvainlion.JPG|right|thumb|"Yvain rescues the lion", from Garrett MS 125, an illustrated manuscript of [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' ''[[Yvain, le Chevalier au Lion]]'', dated to ca. 1295.]]
[[File:The Knight Errant b John Everett Millais 1870.jpg|right|thumb|upright|''The Knight Errant'', [[John Everett Millais]], 1870]]
A knight-errant typically performed all his deeds in the name of a lady, and invoked her name before performing an exploit.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In more sublimated forms of knight-errantry, pure moralist idealism rather than romantic inspiration motivated the knight-errant (as in the case of Sir [[Galahad]]). Such a knight might well be outside the structure of [[feudalism]], wandering solely to perform noble exploits (and perhaps to find a lord to give his service to), but might also be in service to a king or lord, traveling either in pursuit of a specific duty that his overlord charged him with, or to put down evildoers in general. This [[quest]] sends a knight on adventures much like the ones of a knight in search of them, as he happens on the same marvels. In ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', St. George is sent to rescue Una's parents' kingdom from a dragon, and Guyon has no such quest, but both knights encounter perils and adventures.

In the romances, his adventures frequently included greater foes than other knights, including [[Giant (mythology)|giant]]s, [[Magician (paranormal)|enchantress]]es, or [[dragon]]s. They may also gain help that is out of ordinary. Sir [[Ywain]] assisted a lion against a serpent, and was thereafter accompanied by it, becoming the [[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion|Knight of the Lion]]. Other knights-errant have been assisted by [[wild man of the wood|wild men of the woods]], as in ''[[Valentine and Orson]]'', or, like [[Guillaume de Palerme]], by wolves that were, in fact, enchanted princes.

==In modern literature==
The protagonist of  Cormac McCarthy’s novel ''All the Pretty Horses,'' John Grady Cole, is said to be based specifically on Sir Gawain, of ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. Both characters share a number of aspects and traits; both are rooted in the myths of a past that no longer exists, and both live by codes of conduct from a previous era.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pHypAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=knight+errant+gawain&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj414WEtpLdAhWotVkKHatYAUkQ6AEIVDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=knight%20errant%20gawain&amp;f=false ] McGilchrist, Megan Riley.  “The Ties that Bind”. Monk, Nicholas, editor. ''Intertextual and Interdisciplinary Approaches to Cormac McCarthy: Borders and Crossings.'' Routledge, 2012. p. 24. {{ISBN|9781136636066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Quixote]] is an early 17th-century parody of the genre, in reaction to the extreme popularity which late medieval romances such as ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'' came to enjoy in the Iberian Peninsula in the 16th century.

In [[Jean Giraudoux|Jean Giraudoux’s]] play, [[Ondine (play)|Ondine]], which starred [[Audrey Hepburn]] on Broadway in 1954, a knight-errant appears, during a storm, at the humble home of a fisherman and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Giraudoux Four Plays. Hill and Wang. 1958. p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

A depiction of knight-errantry in the modern [[historical novel]] is found in ''[[Sir Nigel]]'' by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] (1906).

The knight-errant stock character became the trope of the "knight in shining armour" in [[depiction of the Middle Ages in popular culture]], and the term came to be used also outside of medieval drama, as in ''[[The Dark Knight Returns|The Dark Knight]]'' as a title of [[Batman]].

In the epic fantasy series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', there is a class of knights referred to as Hedge Knights. A Hedge Knight is a wandering knight without a master, and many are quite poor. Hedge knights travel the length and breadth of [[Westeros]] looking for gainful employment, and their name comes from the propensity to sleep out in the open air or in forests when they cannot afford lodging. The life of a hedge knight is depicted in the [[Tales of Dunk and Egg]].

==Bogatyrs of Kievan Rus'==
{{main|Bogatyr}}
East Slavic ''[[bylina]]'' (epic poetry) feature [[bogatyr]]s, knights-errant who served as protectors of their homeland, and occasionally as adventurers. Some of them are presumed to be historical figures, while others are fictional and possibly descend from [[Slavic mythology]]. Most tales about bogatyrs revolve around the court of [[Vladimir I of Kiev]]. Three popular bogatyrs&amp;mdash;[[Ilya Muromets]], [[Dobrynya Nikitich]] and [[Alyosha Popovich]] (famously painted by [[Victor Vasnetsov]])&amp;mdash;are said to have served him.

==In East Asian cultures==
[[Youxia]], [[China|Chinese]] knights-errant, traveled solo protecting common folk from oppressive regimes. Unlike their European counterpart, they did not come from any particular social caste and were anything from soldiers to poets. There is even a popular literary tradition that arose during the [[Tang Dynasty]] which centered on [[Negrito]]-slaves who used supernatural physical abilities to save kidnapped [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]] and to swim to the bottom of raging rivers to retrieve treasures for their Feudal Lords (see [[Kunlun Nu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Liu, James J.Y. ''The Chinese Knight Errant''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1967 {{ISBN|0-226-48688-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.Snow, Philip. ''The Star Raft: China's Encounter With Africa''. Cornell Univ. Press, 1989 {{ISBN|0-8014-9583-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A youxia who excels or is renowned for martial prowess or skills is usually called [[wuxia]].

In Japan, the expression [[Musha shugyō]] described a Samurai who wanting to test his abilities in real life conditions would travel the land and engage in duels along the way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3735">'''Lester Whyland Sharp''' (April 21, 1887 in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Uhl, "Lester Whyland Sharp", Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, 1962, Vol. 89, No. 3&lt;/ref&gt; – July 17, 1961 in [[Nuevo, California]]) was an [[Americans|American]] [[botanist]], a pioneer in [[cytogenetics]].&lt;ref name=ob&gt;[http://admin.botany.org/plantsciencebulletin/psb-1962-8-1.php Obituaries: Lester W. Sharp ] ''[[Plant Science Bulletin]]'', 1962, vol.8, no. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

He received a BS from [[Alma College]] in 1908. After two years at [[The Johns Hopkins University]], he transferred to the [[University of Chicago]] where he received his PhD in 1912. His postdoctoral work was in association with the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Louvain]], [[Belgium]]. Subsequently, he was with [[Cornell University]] until his retirement as [[professor emeritus]] of [[botany]] in 1947.

[[Barbara McClintock]] worked as a research assistant for [[Lowell Fitz Randolph]] and then for Lester W. Sharp, during her graduate studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Federica Turriziani |last=Colonna |title=Barbara McClintock (1902-1992) |url=http://embryo.asu.edu/pages/barbara-mcclintock-1902-1992 |publisher=embryo.asu.edu |accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He authored two classical textbooks in [[cell biology|cytology]]: ''An Introduction to Cytology'' (1921) and ''Fundamentals of cytology'' (1943)

He was vice-president of the American Society of Naturalists in 1924, vice-president of the Botanical Society of America in 1929 and president in 1930. He served on the editorial boards of the ''[[American Journal of Botany]]'', ''[[Stain Technology]]'' and the ''[[Botanical Review]]''. He was awarded an honorary DSc by [[Alma College]] in 1930 and by the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Louvain]] in [[Belgium]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=ob/&gt;

In 1958 he received the [[Botanical Society of America]] Merit Award. The nomination from the Cornell University said: "His contributions, both by personal investigations and by successive editions of carefully edited textbooks, have made [[plant cytology]] a significant field of Botany."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botany.org/awards_grants/detail/bsamerit.php Botanical Society of America Merit Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional humor==

The wit of professor Sharp was also expressed in [[humor]]ous vein. The most notable examples are his retirement address as president of the Botanical Society entitled "A Nuclear Century", in which he lively reviews studies on the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;"A Nuclear Century", ''[[Scientific Monthly]]'', 1932, vol. 34, pp. 322–329&lt;/ref&gt; Another one is a hoax presented together with graduate student, Cuthbert Fraser, about the most unusual bird from the [[Gobi Desert]], ''[[Eoörnis pterovelox gobiensis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/eoornis.html "The Woofen-Poof (aka Eoörnis Pterovelox Gobiensis)"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Eoornis Pterovelox Gobiensis", by Augustus C. Fotheringham, 
''[[Quarterly Review of Biology]]'', Vol. 51, 50th Anniversary Special Issue, 1926-1976 (1976), pp. 90-91&lt;/ref&gt; which has later been numerously reprinted in the form of a PhD thesis, e.g., as.&lt;ref&gt;Augustus C. Fotheringham (2007) "Eoörnis Pterovelox Gobiensis, [[lulu.com]] {{ISBN|1-906267-05-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2018}}

In [[film|cinema]], a '''making-of''', also known as '''behind-the-scenes''', '''the set''' or  '''on the set''' is a [[documentary film]] that features the [[Filmmaking#Production|production]] of a film or [[television program]]. This is often referred to as the EPK ([[electronic press kit]]) video, due to its main usage as a promotional tool, either concurrent with theatrical release or as a bonus feature for the film's [[DVD]] or [[Bluray]] release.

[[Feature length]] documentaries on the making of other films has become a film genre in its own right. The making-of film may ultimately be more important than the film itself. In the case of ''[[Lost in La Mancha]]'', the making-of video ended up documenting the collapse and abandonment of the feature film it was covering (''[[The Man Who Killed Don Quixote]]''), and ultimately the making-of video was the only part of the production to see a commercial release as a theatrical documentary feature.

Shorter making-of documentaries are often used as a bonus on DVDs, as it offers more insight into the film, how it was made, and to credit the [[film crew]]. Occasionally, some films have included a "making of the making-of" as a joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.videomaker.com/article/13762-special-features-dvd-extras|title=Special Features: DVD Extras|work=Videomaker.com|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The making-of is also often released for TV as a part of the promotion of the film.

While promoting the book in radio interviews with [[WBUR]]'s ''[[On Point]]'' and [[NPR]]'s ''[[Tell Me More]]'', Seltzer spoke with an [[African American Vernacular English|African American Vernacular]] dialect and frequently referred to alleged gang friends as "[[homie]]s" and "my home girl."&lt;ref name="OP"&gt;{{cite news |title= "Love and Consequences" in South Central LA (RealAudio file) |url= http://realserver.bu.edu:8080/ramgen/w/b/wbur/onpoint/2008/02/op_0229b.rm |publisher= [[On Point]] |first= Tom |last= Ashbrook |date= February 29, 2008 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110522193935/http://realserver.bu.edu:8080/ramgen/w/b/wbur/onpoint/2008/02/op_0229b.rm |archivedate= May 22, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TMM"&gt;{{cite news |title=  Margaret Seltzer Joins List of Fabricating Writers (RealAudio file) |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/player/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&amp;t=1&amp;islist=false&amp;id=87917347&amp;m=87917342|publisher= [[National Public Radio]] |work=[[Tell Me More]] | first= M |last= Martin |date=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's publisher, [[Riverhead Books]], has recalled all copies of the book and audiobook from booksellers, [[Amazon.com]] and [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] have pulled the purchase page for the book from both of their sites, and Riverhead has offered refunds to those who purchased it.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; The hoax was discovered when the publisher was contacted by Seltzer's sister.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

'''''Muscat Daily''''' is an Omani newspaper that was founded in 2009. The print edition of ''Muscat Daily'' is the largest-selling English daily in Oman with nearly 33,000 copies sold every day on Omani weekdays (Saturday to Wednesday) {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}. The paper does not have a weekend edition currently. ''Muscat Daily'' is owned by Apex Press and Publishing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apexstuff.com/about/company.asp |title=Apex Press and Publishing website |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a leading Omani publishing company which publishes several other titles including the hugely popular ''[[TheWeek]]'', ''Business Today'', ''Oman Today'', ''Usrat Al Youm'', ''Al Isbou'a'', ''Business Directory'' and ''Tribute''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ameinfo.com/175976.html|title=Apex unveils Tribute 2008|publisher=AME Info|accessdate=January 10, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010194842/http://www.ameinfo.com/175976.html|archivedate=October 10, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apex also does occasional [[projects]] like the Map of Oman, Apex Map of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], The [[Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque]] coffee table book etc. Apex Press and Publishing was founded in 1980 by Omani businessman Saleh Zakwani, who is also the current chairman of the company.

The newspaper celebrated its first anniversary on October 13. ''Muscat Daily'' is accessible online at [http://muscatdaily.com muscatdaily.com].

==Content==

Editorial content is generated by an in-house team of reporters and writers in the case of Oman news. International news is sourced from a variety of [[newswires]] including [http://www.nytsyn.com/ The New York Times Syndicate and News Service], [[BBC]], [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|dpa]], [[TMS Features]], [[Indo-Asian News Service|IANS]], [[Asian News Network]]. The paper runs crosswords provided by ''[[The Guardian]]''.

===Sections===
The newspaper is organized in two sections. Section 1 is the main section with 20 pages containing Oman (National) news, Regional and World news, Op-Ed and Sports.
Section 2 has Business, Crosswords, [[Sudoku]] puzzles, quiz questions and a Features section.
On Wednesdays, ''[[TheWeek]]'' newspaper is delivered home to ''Muscat Daily'' subscribers as weekend reading.

===Design and style===
The newspaper which features a bright [[tulip]] orange and black theme was designed by its creative director, Benoite Lopes, in a seven column format. The design has received favorable reviews at design workshops run by WAN-IFRA the biggest association of publishers in the world{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}. ''Muscat Daily'' is still not a full colour paper as it is printed at the Omani government-owned ''Oman Observer'' press.

In February 2010, parent company Apex Press and Publishing announced that they had signed an agreement to purchase a Goss Community SSC [[Printing press|Press]] with a rated speed of 35,000 copies per hour from the American printing press manufacturer.&lt;ref name=printingtalk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.printingtalk.com/news/gss/gss285.html|title=Apex to purchase Goss Community Press|publisher=Printing Talk|accessdate=March 30, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100504043616/http://www.printingtalk.com/news/gss/gss285.html|archivedate=May 4, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apex had previously printed its titles with other printers since it had never invested in its own press. Mohana Prabhakar, chief executive and [[managing editor]] of Apex Press and Publishing, was quoted as saying that using contract printers had become an increasing problem as the company expanded its portfolio of titles. This was the main reason that Apex finally decided to invest in its own printing press despite the extra printing capacity available in the country with other printers.&lt;ref name=printingtalk/&gt;

Despite the relative young age of the newspaper, the [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] quickly picked up and the paper went on to become the largest selling English-language daily in the Sultanate of Oman by mid-2010{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}. The main reason quoted by industry analysts for this was the low annual [[subscription]] fees of the newspaper in a market which traditionally had fewer than 1,000 residential subscribers for English dailies before the entry of ''Muscat Daily''. An annual [[subscription]] to Muscat Daily cost OMR 50 (about $130) compared to the OMR 72 ($186) of competitors likes ''[[Times of Oman]]'', ''[[Oman Tribune]]'' and ''[[Oman Daily Observer]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Political persuasion overall==
''Muscat Daily'' has been described by analysts as having a centrist liberal bias on most issues. Overall, the stated mission of the paper and its management is to report and not sensationalise or editorialise matters.

==Other controversies==
''Muscat Daily'' has been criticized as being a late entry into the newspaper arena in Oman at a time when newspaper [[subscriptions]] are falling in the [[Western world|West]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} In a scathing critique, Eliott Beer posted on AdNation Middle East's website, "Apparently no-one's told the guys in Oman about the demise of traditional [[print media]] (it's dead, you know) - some publisher's only gone and started up another newspaper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://adnationme.com/news/media-news/muscat-daily-preps-for-launch.html|title=AdNation criticises Muscat Daily launch|publisher=AdNation|accessdate=March 30, 2011|first=Eliott|last=Beer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, parent company Apex Press and Publishing says that newspaper circulations are increasing in [[emerging markets]] and since the penetration of [[broadband]] in Oman is still only about 12% &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/middle.htm|title=Broadband statistics in Oman|publisher=Internet world stats|accessdate=May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the total population, it does not see any threat to its print business. Muscat Daily was launched as a direct competitor to other English language dailies in Oman including the ''Times of Oman'', ''Oman Tribune'' and the government-run ''Oman Daily Observer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeastmediaguide.com/downloads/newspapers.pdf|title=Middle East Newspaper Guide for download|publisher=Middle East Guide|accessdate=March 30, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720105444/http://www.middleeastmediaguide.com/downloads/newspapers.pdf|archivedate=July 20, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Muscat Daily'' in international media==
The role that ''Muscat Daily'' has played in pushing the boundaries of media freedom and censorship in 'the sleepy sultanate' has been recognized by world media, particularly those that work in markets where media freedom is guaranteed. An article in ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' on the protests and media freedom in Oman said:

''"The fact that Oman's first civil unrest in 40 years left at least one person dead in a northern port city here was big news. But it was even bigger news that the English-language Muscat Daily declared "Black Sunday in Sohar" on its front page and carried a half-page photograph showing smoke filling the sky above a roundabout seized by protesters."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0301/In-Oman-protests-spur-timid-media-to-cover-the-news|title=Muscat Daily coverage of Sohar protests pushes the lines of media censorship in Oman|work=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article was subsequently carried in other prominent newspapers and publications across the world including [[Gulf News]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.gulfnews.com/news/gulf/oman/sea-change-in-media-coverage-1.770758|title=Christian Science Monitor article on Oman media in Gulf News|publisher=Gulf News|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yahoo News,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/oman-protests-spur-timid-media-cover-news-20110301-122600-257.html|title=Media freedom article by Jackie Spinner on Yahoo News Canada|publisher=Yahoo News|accessdate=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; MinnPost &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minnpost.com/worldcsm/2011/03/02/26244/in_oman_protests_spur_timid_media_to_cover_the_news|title=Oman's protest spurs timid media to cover the news|publisher=MinnPost|accessdate=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article in ''[[The Economist]]'' in early March 2011, ''"Newspapers such as the Muscat Daily have begun to cover the protests in a way that would have been unthinkable even a week ago."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18291567?story_id=18291567|title=The sultanate suddenly stirs|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other international media, Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'' has quoted ''Muscat Daily'' in its coverage of the 2011 Omani protests and the related action by the government and other actors in the [[2011 protests]]. Talking about the reforms instituted by [[Sultan Qaboos]], in the wake of the protests it said:
''"Según datos recabados por el Muscat Daily, la medida beneficia a 130.000 ciudadanos, el 73% de todos los que trabajan ese sector."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/Oman/moviliza/Ejercito/protesta/elpepiint/20110302elpepiint_12/Tes|title=Protests and reforms in Oman|publisher=El País|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Translation: According to data compiled by Muscat Daily, the new measures will benefit about 130,000 people or about 73% of those working in the private sector.)

The '''Museum of Toys and Automata''' (in [[Catalan language]] ''Museu de Joguets i Autòmats'') was a museum of [[toy]]s and [[automata]] located in [[Verdú]], in central Catalonia, Spain. It opened in 2004, and in 2013 it closed and the building was converted to an art gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.324.cat/noticia/1946432/ociicultura/El-Museu-de-Joguets-de-Verdu-sera-en-un-Museu-dArt-el-2013|title=El Museu de Joguets de Verdú serà en un Museu d'Art el 2013|publisher=[[TV3 (Catalonia)]]|language=Catalan|date=2012-10-25|accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was founded by local man Manel Mayoral, who had built up an extensive collection of antique toys and novelties. It was housed at an old house known as "Cal Jan" in Verdú's main square, over three floors and more than 2000 square meters, half of that in a modern extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.324.cat/noticia/1162029/urgell/El-Museu-de-Joguets-i-Automats-de-Verdu-amplia-un-50-la-seva-superficie-i-incorpora-un-fons-dart|title=El Museu de Joguets i Autòmats de Verdú amplia un 50% la seva superfície i incorpora un fons d'art|publisher=[[TV3 (Catalonia)]]|language=Catalan|date=2011-04-20|accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cal Jan was built in the 15th century, as were all the other buildings on the same street, and became an important house of Verdú. The lintels of the first floor balconies are an example of early 17th century architecture. In fact, there is an inscription on the façade dating from 1695, which is the year the house was reconstructed. In 1999, the building's conversion to a museum was started, and it was extended and extensively remodelled.

'''Palestine Park''' is a [[scale model]] of the [[Holy Land]], including cities, hills, rivers, and seas, in approximately correct geographical relation on the grounds of [[Chautauqua Institution]] in [[Chautauqua, New York]]. Palestine Park is laid out along the southwestern side of [[Chautauqua Lake]], which takes the place of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. This creates a rotated version of the actual land, which is on the east coast of the Mediterranean. A large mound of stones represents [[Mount Hermon]], with an artificial stream representing the [[Jordan River]] as it flows south from the [[Sea of Galilee]] to the [[Dead Sea]]. Small hills represent biblical landmarks such as [[Mount Tabor, Israel|Mount Tabor]] and the [[Mount of Olives]], with markers representing sites of biblical significance including [[Shechem|Jacob's Well]], [[Jericho]], [[Bethsaida]] and a scale model of [[Jerusalem]] in the time of [[Jesus]]   complete with a [[Replicas of the Jewish Temple|small replica of the ancient Jewish Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;Imagining the Holy Land: maps, models, and fantasy travels
By Burke O. Long, Indiana University Press, 2002, pp. 28 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, people arrived at Chautauqua via ferryboats and disembarked at Palestine Park so that their first footsteps were on the Holy Land as though they were pilgrims going up to Jerusalem; an actual journey to the Land of Israel was well beyond the financial ability of most Americans in that era.&lt;ref&gt;Chautauqua America, Peter Feinman, The American Interest, Vol V, no. 5, May/June 2010, pp. 83-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The park is a [[contributing property]] in the [[Chautauqua Institution Historic District]].

The park was one of Chautauqua's first landmarks. In 1874, Chautauqua founder Rev. [[John Heyl Vincent]] gave his friend Dr. W. W. Wythe the task of laying out Palestine Park as a visual aid for teaching [[Biblical studies|Biblical history]] and geography to the [[Sunday School]] teachers that were Chautauqua's first visitors.  The park has been reconstructed many times over the years. The present Palestine Park is 350 feet long with a scale of 1.75 feet to the mile.

There are educational guided tours through the park each Sunday and Monday at 7 p.m. (weather permitting) during Chautauqua's nine-week summer season.

[[File:Jeu de mikado.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Mikado (game)|Mikado]] pick-up sticks]]
'''Pick-up sticks''' or '''pick-a-stick''' is a game of physical and mental skill in which a bundle of "sticks", between 8 and 20&amp;nbsp;centimeters long, are dropped as a loose bunch onto a table top, jumbling into a random pile. Each player in turn tries to remove a stick from the pile without disturbing any of the others. The game is known by several names including '''jackstraws''' (or '''jack straws'''), '''spellicans''', and '''spillikins''', and appears in a line of a [[nursery rhyme]]: "...five, six, pick-up sticks!" 

The sticks may be made of almost any material, such as [[ivory]], [[bone]], [[wood]], [[bamboo]], [[straw]], [[Phragmites|reed]], [[Juncaceae|rush]], [[yarrow]], or [[plastics]].
Some [[Pick-up sticks (Haida)|Haida First Nation pick-up sticks]] are plain [[maple]] wood decorated with [[abalone]] shell and copper.

Today, the most common pick-up sticks game is [[Mikado (game)|Mikado]].  It remains difficult in all variations.

== Play ==
The object of the game is to pick up the most sticks.

To begin the game, a bundle of sticks is randomly distributed so that they end up in a tangled pile.  The more tangled the resulting disarray, the more challenging the game. In some versions of the game, any isolated sticks, or sticks lying alone, are removed.

The players attempt to remove a single stick, without moving any other stick. In some versions of the game, players use a tool to move the stick away from the pile; this "tool" may be one of the sticks, held aside before the game begins. In other versions, players must pick up the sticks by hand. In either case, players must not move any other things while attempting to remove the said stick; if any other stick moves, his turn ends immediately and he loses a turn. Players who successfully pick up a stick can then have another turn; the player keeps removing sticks until he causes a secondary stick to move.

In some versions of the game, different-coloured sticks are worth different numbers of points, and the winner is the person with the highest score.

== Jackstraws ==

The pieces in a jackstraw set are often thematically related to farmyard tools, such as ladders, rakes, shovels, and hoes. There are typically around 45 pieces in a set and made of wood, plastic, bone, or ivory. In addition to the jackstraws themselves, there is typically a helper piece with a hooked end for use in snagging and manipulating pieces. Each piece has a point value, with more challenging pieces being worth more points.

=== Equipment ===

*1 hook
*approx 45 jackstraws

=== Object ===

Players try to win points by removing jackstraws – in the shapes of various tools – from the pile, one at a time.

=== Rules ===

#If you're the first player, hold all the jackstraws about 5 centimetres from the table. Then drop them so that they fall into a pile.
#Using the hook or your fingers, try to remove jackstraws from the pile, one at a time without moving the others at all. If any jackstraws have fallen free from the pile, you may remove them first. Each time you succeed in removing one, keep it and try to remove another. Once you've started to remove a jackstraw, you can't change your mind and decide to remove another.
#If you move one or more jackstraws while you're trying to remove another, you must end your turn. Players are encouraged to watch each opponent's turn very closely.
#When your turn ends, the next player picks up and drops the remaining jackstraws and plays in the same manner. You can also just start playing from where you left off without dropping the jackstraws again.
#Continue playing until all the jackstraws are gone from the pile.

=== Winning ===

At the end of the game, players total the point values of their jackstraws. The players with the most points wins.

===Scoring===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3851">In the '''platonia dilemma''' introduced in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas |title=Dilemmas for Superrational Thinkers, Leading Up to a Luring Lottery |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=248 |number=6 |date=June 1983 }} – reprinted in: {{Cite book |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas |title=[[Metamagical Themas]] |pages=737–755 |year=1985 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-04566-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an eccentric trillionaire gathers 20 people together, and tells them that if one and only one of them sends him a telegram (reverse charges) by noon the next day, that person will receive a billion dollars. If he receives more than one telegram, or none at all, no one will get any money, and cooperation between players is forbidden. In this situation, the [[superrationality|superrational]] thing to do is to send a telegram with probability 1/20.

==Luring Lottery==
A similar game, referred to as a "Luring Lottery", was actually played by the editors of ''[[Scientific American]]'' in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas |year= |title=Irrationality Is the Square Root of All Evil |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=249 |number=3 |date=September 1983 }} – reprinted in: {{Cite book |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas |title=[[Metamagical Themas]] |pages=756–766 |year=1985 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-04566-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To enter the contest once, readers had to send in a postcard with the number "1" written on it.  They were also explicitly permitted to submit as many entries as they wished by sending in a single postcard bearing the number of entries they wished to submit.  The prize was one million dollars divided by the total number of entries received, to be awarded to the submitter of a randomly chosen entry.  Thus a reader who submitted a large number of entries increased his or her chances of winning but reduced the maximum possible value of the prize.  It can be shown mathematically that one maximizes one's average winnings in this game by submitting a number of entries equal to the total number of entries of others.  Of course, if others take this into account, then this strategy translates into a runaway reaction to unbounded number of entries being submitted.

According to the magazine, the superrational thing was for each contestant to roll a simulated [[dice|die]] with the number of sides equal to the number of expected responders (about 5% of the readership), and then send "1" if you roll "1".  If all contestants had followed this strategy, it is possible that the magazine would have received a single postcard, with a "1", and would have had to pay a million dollars to the sender of that postcard.  Reputedly the publisher and owners were very concerned about betting the company on a game.

Although the magazine had previously discussed the concept of [[superrationality]] from which the above-mentioned algorithm can be deduced, many of the contestants submitted entries consisting of an astronomically large number (including several who entered a [[googolplex]]).  Some took this game further by filling their postcards with mathematical expressions designed to evaluate to the largest possible number in the limited space allowed.  The magazine was unable to tell who won, and the monetary value of the prize would have been a minuscule fraction of a cent.

'''Pride Fighting Championships''' ('''Pride''' or '''Pride FC''', founded as '''KRS-Pride''') was a Japanese [[mixed martial arts]] [[promoter (entertainment)|promotion company]]. Its inaugural event was held at the [[Tokyo Dome]] on October 11, 1997. Pride held more than [[List of Pride events|sixty]] mixed martial arts events, broadcast to about 40 countries worldwide.&lt;ref name="whatispride"&gt;[http://www.pridefc.com/pride2005/whats_about01.htm What is Pride?], Official Pride site. Last retrieved December 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Pride held the largest live MMA event audience record of 91,107 people at the Pride and [[K-1]] co-production, ''[[Pride Shockwave|Shockwave/Dynamite]]'', held in August 2002,&lt;ref name="Total Attendance"&gt;{{cite web|title=Total Attendance|url=http://www.tapology.com/search/mma-event-figures/total-attendance|website=tapology.com|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the audience record of over 67,450 people at the ''[[Pride Final Conflict 2003]]''. For ten years PRIDE was one of the most popular MMA organizations in the world.

In March 2007, [[Dream Stage Entertainment]] (DSE) sold Pride to [[Lorenzo Fertitta]] and [[Frank Fertitta III]], co-owners of [[Zuffa]], which, at the time, owned the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC).&lt;ref&gt;Nagatsuka, Kaz, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/sp20120228a1.html UFC hopes to shake up Japan fight scene]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 28 February 2012, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; While remaining as legally separate entities with separate managements, the two promotions were set to cooperate in a manner akin to the [[AFL-NFL merger]]. However, such an arrangement did not materialize, and in October 2007, Pride Worldwide's Japanese staff was laid off, marking the end of the organization as an active fight promoter. As a result, many of the Pride staff left to form a new organization alongside [[K-1]] parent company [[Fighting and Entertainment Group]]. That new organization, founded in February 2008, was named [[Dream (mixed martial arts)|Dream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmaweekly.com/the-dream-is-gone-japanese-mma-promotion-runs-out-of-viable-options|title=The Dream is Gone; Japanese MMA Promotion Runs Out of Viable Options|date=June 3, 2012|accessdate=June 3, 2012|publisher=mmaweekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Pride's co-founder and former president Nobuyuki Sakakibara established [[Rizin Fighting Federation]] in Japan with the same philosophy and ambition as for the defunct Pride organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 'New PRIDE' to be called Rizin Fighting Federation - Mixed Martial Arts News|url = http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/news/454573/New-PRIDE-to-be-called-Rizin-Fighting-Federation/|website = www.mixedmartialarts.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
The precursors of Pride were the Japanese mixed martial arts competitions [[UWF International]] (founded in 1991) and [[Pancrase]] (founded in 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/5/2/4220042/ufc-mma-history-origins-pride-fc-rickson-gracie-Nobuhiko-Takada|title=MMA Origins: Fighting For Pride|website=BloodyElbow|last=Grant|first=T.

Let 'Ali vs. Inoki' author Josh Gross explain|work=[[MMAjunkie]]|date=June 13, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pride Fighting Championships was initially conceived of in 1997, to match popular [[Japanese people|Japanese]] pro-wrestler [[Nobuhiko Takada]] with [[Rickson Gracie]], the purported champion of the [[Gracie family]] of [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] practitioners. The event, held at the Tokyo Dome on October 11, 1997, and organised by Hiromichi Momose, Naoto Morishita and [[Nobuyuki Sakakibara]] from KRS (Kakutougi Revolutionary Spirits) promotion, attracted 47,000 fans, as well as Japanese mass media attention. The success of the first event enabled its promoters to hold a regular series of mixed martial arts events, and a year later in 1998, to promote a rematch between Takada and Gracie.&lt;ref name="japansfightclubs"&gt;[http://www.japaninc.com/article.php?articleID=1026 Japan's Fight Clubs], JapanInc.com. Last retrieved December 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; With [[K-1]] enjoying popularity in Japan, Pride began to compete with monthly showings on [[Fuji Television]], as well as pay per view on the newly formed satellite television channel [[SKY PerfecTV]]. Following the fourth event, the series was taken over by the [[Dream Stage Entertainment]], formed by the members of the dissolved KRS, and it was accordingly renamed as the Pride Fighting Championships, with Morishita as its first chairman.

In 2000, Pride hosted the first ''Pride Grand Prix'', a two-part openweight tournament held to find the "world's best fighter". The tournament was held over the course of two events, with sixteen fighters competing in an [[Pride Grand Prix 2000 Opening Round|opening round]] and the eight winners returning three months later for the [[Pride Grand Prix 2000 Finals|final round]]. The second round of the tournament marked the first time Pride was broadcast in the United States and featured American fighter [[Mark Coleman]] winning the tournament by defeating [[Igor Vovchanchyn]] in the final round.

In August 2002, Pride teamed up with Japan's leading kickboxing and fight promotion, K-1, and held the world's biggest fight event, ''[[Pride Shockwave|Shockwave]]'' (known as ''Pride/K-1 Dynamite!!'' in Japan), which attracted over 71,000 fans.
&lt;ref name="Total Attendance"/&gt;
On January 13, 2003, the Pride MMA production was thrown into turmoil when DSE president Naoto Morishita was found dead hanging by his neck in his hotel room, apparently after his mistress told him she wanted to end their affair.&lt;ref name="suicide"&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/face/archive/news/2003/20030116p2g00m0dm999000c.html Fight promoter cashes in his chips]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Mainichi Daily News. Last retrieved December 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation loomed whether this could possibly be the real reason, as trouble with tax authorities and the [[yakuza]] have also been speculated as playing a role.&lt;ref name="japansfightclubs" /&gt; Nobuyuki Sakakibara later assumed the presidency, later joined by Takada as a general manager.

In 2003 Pride introduced the ''Bushido'' series of events, which focused mainly, but not exclusively, on the lighter weight classes of lightweights and welterweights. The Bushido series also stressed a faster pace, with bouts consisting of only one ten-minute round and one five-minute round, as well as quicker referee intervention of stalling tactics, using the new "yellow card" system of purse deduction.

Also in 2003, Pride returned to the tournament format, with a middleweight grand prix spanning two events, ''[[2003 in Pride FC#Pride Total Elimination 2003|Pride Total Elimination 2003]]'' and ''[[Pride Final Conflict 2003|Final Conflict 2003]]''. The format was expanded to three events in 2004, adding ''[[Pride Critical Countdown 2004|Critical Countdown 2004]]'' as the second round. Pride would go on to hold annual tournaments, a heavyweight tournament in 2004, a middleweight in 2005, and an openweight in 2006.

[[File:Pride Fighting intro.jpg|thumb|350px|A Pride Fighting Championships fighter introduction in 2005]]

In 2006 DSE announced it would showcase Pride alongside the Ultimate Fighting Championship, North America's largest MMA event, and would be integrating their fighters, including [[Wanderlei Silva]] and [[Kazuyuki Fujita]], at a UFC MMA show in November.&lt;ref name="silvafujitaufc"&gt;[http://www.pridefc.com/pride2005/index.php?mainpage=news&amp;news_id=767 WANDERLEI SILVA &amp; CHUCK LIDDELL SET TO WAR IN THE OCTAGON], Official PRIDE site. Last retrieved December 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Dana White]], speaking on behalf of Zuffa then commented that the announced bout between [[Chuck Liddell]] and Wanderlei Silva was unlikely to happen because "the Japanese are very hard to do business with".&lt;ref name="danawhite"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/cp/sports/060811/s081144.html Liddell Silva fight could be off, according to UFC president], CBC.ca. Last retrieved December 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This statement was likely due to the failure of previous attempts between Zuffa and DSE to organize a fighter exchange agreement. Specifically after entering Liddell in Pride's 2003 middleweight tournament, which was also with the intention of Liddell eventually fighting Silva, which fell through when Liddell lost in the semi-finals to [[Quinton Jackson]] (Jackson subsequently lost to Silva by [[technical knockout]] in the finals.)

Pride continued to enjoy success, holding roughly ten events per year, and even out-drawing rival K-1 at the annual New Year's Eve show ''[[Pride Shockwave 2005]]''. On October 21, 2006, Pride held its first MMA event in US, ''[[Pride 32|Pride 32: The Real Deal]]'' took place in front of an audience of 11,727 at the [[Thomas &amp; Mack Center]] in [[Paradise, Nevada]], and was the first Pride event to be held outside Japan.&lt;ref name="realdeal"&gt;[http://www.pridefc.com/pride2005/index.php?mainpage=news&amp;news_id=889 Pride FIGHTING PLANS TO STAY IN THE US], PRIDE official site.

On June 5, 2006, the Fuji Network announced that they were terminating their television contract with Pride Fighting Championships effective immediately due to a breach of contract by DSE.&lt;ref name="fujitv"&gt;[http://www.fightopinion.com/2006/06/05/fuji-tv-cancels-pride-for-good/ Fuji TV cancels PRIDE for good], FightOpinion.com. Last retrieved December 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This left Pride with only [[SKY PerfecTV]], a pay-per-view carrier, as a television outlet in Japan, and the loss of the substantial revenues from the Fuji deal threatened its sustainability. Dream was surrounded by speculation in the Japanese media, especially in the Japanese tabloid ''[[Shukan Gendai]]'', that it may be a front for the notorious yakuza crime organization. Dream responded to the loss by stating they will continue with their schedule as currently planned, including an event in Las Vegas, ''[[Pride 33|Pride 33: Second Coming]]'' which took place on February 24, 2007, Pride's second event outside Japan.&lt;ref name="junepc"&gt;[http://www.fightopinion.com/2006/06/07/dse-press-conference-notes/ DSE press conference notes], FightOpinion.com. Last retrieved December 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2006, DSE hinted at plans for [[Mike Tyson]] to fight in the organization's [[Pride Shockwave 2006|New Year's Eve show]].&lt;ref name="realdeal" /&gt; Tyson was to face a Pride fighter under [[boxing]] rules. Since Tyson is not allowed to fight in Japan because of his criminal record, Pride wanted to stage the fight in an alternate country, possibly [[Macau, China]]. The fight would be broadcast live on large television screens in the [[Saitama Super Arena]], where the regular mixed martial arts bouts were held.&lt;ref name="tyson2"&gt;[http://www.mmafighting.com/news/2006/mike_tyson_world_tour.html "Mike Tyson's World Tour" begins October 20, MMAFighting.com.

On November 29, 2006, Pride announced the discontinuation of its Bushido events, with the intention of integrating the matches from lighter weight classes, mainly featured in Bushido, into regular Pride events. Pride also announced that future Grand Prix tournaments would take place on a four-year weight class cycle, with one Grand Prix per year.&lt;ref name="2007changes"&gt;[http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=3005&amp;zoneid=8 Pride MAKING BIG CHANGES IN 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111609/http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=3005&amp;zoneid=8 |date=2007-09-29 }}, MMAWeekly.com.

On Tuesday, March 27, 2007, Pride executives Nobuyuki Sakakibara and [[Nobuhiko Takada]] announced that [[Station Casinos]] Inc. magnate Lorenzo Fertitta, co-owner of Zuffa and its subsidiary MMA production Ultimate Fighting Championship, had made a deal to acquire all assets of Pride Fighting Championships from Dream Stage Entertainment after [[Pride 34|Pride 34: Kamikaze]] in a deal reportedly worth [[US Dollar|USD$]]65 million,&lt;ref name="JRE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GofZQEWc6as#t=7304 |title=Joe Rogan Experience #616 - John Wayne Parr |publisher=YouTube |date=2015-02-22 |accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;''[[Associated Press]]'', [http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/news/story?id=2814235 Source: UFC buys Pride for less than $70M], March 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; though the figure was not publicly disclosed.&lt;ref name=thefightnetwork&gt;The Fight Network. [http://www.thefightnetwork.com/news_detail.php?nid=4671 PM Update – August 26], August 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Managing the assets under the newly created Pride FC Worldwide Holdings, LLC, including their video library and the contracts of the fighters currently on the Pride roster, the new management company had originally planned to continue to promote Pride events in Japan and keep to its previously announced schedule. Lorenzo Fertitta announced they planned to operate Pride separately from Zuffa's two MMA brands, the UFC and [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]], planned on having occasional crossover shows and matches, pitting fighters from Pride against fighters "from the UFC," using the metaphor of the AFL-NFL merger to compare the situation.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

Subsequent remarks by Zuffa spokesperson Dana White however cast doubt as to what the new owners would actually do with Pride. After the sale officially closed on May 25, 2007, White remarked that he planned on bringing Pride's biggest names into UFC competition instead of keeping them in Pride and that they were still deciding on what to do with Pride itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

I don't think they want us there. I don't think they want me there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Multimedia===

====Video====

The final Pride events have been released on DVD under the Pride Worldwide label.

Past fights from Pride are shown on ''Best of Pride Fighting Championships''. The program premiered January 15, 2010, on [[Spike TV]]. The program's host is [[Kenda Perez]].

====Video games====
Pride Fighting Championships released two licensed video games during its time in business. As well as being featured in an [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] game in 2012.

* The first game, ''[[Pride Fighting Championships (video game)|Pride FC: Fighting Championships]]'' was developed by Anchor Inc. and released by [[THQ]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] in February 2003 in Japan and North America and April 2003 in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/ps2/pride-fc-fighting-championships PRIDE FC: Fighting Championships on MobyGames] Retrieved 2012-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The game received an aggregate score of 73/100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 19 critic reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/pride-fc-fighting-championships|title=Pride FC: Fighting Championships|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second game, ''[[PrideGP Grand Prix 2003]]'' was developed and released by [[Capcom]] also for the PlayStation 2 in November 2003, but was only released in Japan.
* Pride Fighting Championships was also featured in the video game ''[[UFC Undisputed 3]]''. Featuring main Pride event rules and 33 Pride fighters (not counting the Pride alumni on the UFC roster to date), the mode also has commentary provided by [[Bas Rutten]], [[Stephen Quadros]] and [[Lenne Hardt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ufcundisputed.com/go/article/view/gameplay_news/251673/welcome_to_ufc_undisputed_3:_pride_mode! |title=Whoops!

==Rules==
Pride's rules&lt;ref name="priderules"&gt;[http://www.pridefc.com/pride2005/whats_rules.htm Pride rules], Official Pride site. Last retrieved December 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; differed between main Pride events and Bushido events. It was announced on November 29, 2006, that Bushido events would be discontinued.&lt;ref name="2007changes" /&gt;

===Match length===
Pride matches consisted of three rounds; the first lasted ten minutes and the second and third each lasted five minutes. Intermissions between each round were two minutes long. In Pride events held in the United States, [[Nevada State Athletic Commission|NSAC]] Unified MMA rules were used: non-title matches consisted of three five-minute rounds and title matches consisted of five five-minute rounds, both with 60-second intermissions between rounds.

When two rounds of a Grand Prix took place on the same night, Grand Prix bouts consisted of two rounds, the first lasting ten minutes and the second lasting five. Intermissions between each round remained two minutes long.

===Weight classes===
:''Pride Fighting Championships did not divide their fighters based on weight divisions per se. A fighter could be booked to fight an opponent of any weight. Weight divisions were used for championship bouts and for Grands Prix to decide a best fighter at a given weight class.''

===Ring===
Pride used a five-roped square ring with sides 7&amp;nbsp;m in length (approximately 23&amp;nbsp;ft). The same was used at Pride: Bushido events.

===Attire===
Pride allowed fighters latitude in their choice of attire but open finger gloves, a mouthguard and a protective cup were mandatory. Fighters were allowed to use [[adhesive tape|tape]] on parts of their body or to wear a [[keikogi|gi]] top, gi pants, wrestling shoes, kneepads, elbow pads, or ankle supports, and masks at their own discretion, though each was checked by the referee before the fight.

===Victory===
Matches could be won via:
* '''Submission'''
**A fighter taps either his opponent or the mat three times
**A fighter verbally submits
* '''Technical submission'''
** A fighter goes unconscious from a choke
** An arm, or any other body part, is broken by the submission 
* '''Knockout'''
**A fighter falls from a legal blow and is either unconscious or unable to immediately continue
* '''Technical knockout'''
** Referee stoppage (the referee stops the match after seeing that one fighter is completely dominant to the point of endangering his opponent)
** Doctor stoppage (the referee stops the match in the event that a fighter is injured via a legal blow and the ring doctor determines that he cannot continue)
** Forfeited match (a fighter's corner throws in the towel)
* '''Decision'''
**If the match reaches its time limit then the outcome of the bout is determined by the three judges. The fight is scored in its entirety and not round-by-round. (In Pride events staged in the United States, however, the fights were scored round by round.) After the third round, each judge must decide a winner. Matches cannot end in a draw. A decision is made according to the following criteria in this order of priority:
:#The effort made to finish the fight via KO or submission
:#Damage given to the opponent
:#Standing combinations and ground control
:#Takedowns and takedown defense
:#Aggressiveness
:#Weight (in the case that the weight difference is 10&amp;nbsp;kg/22&amp;nbsp;lb or more)

:If a fight was stopped on advice of the ring doctor after an accidental but illegal action, e.g. a clash of heads, and the contest is in its second or third round, the match was decided by the judges using the same criteria.
* '''Disqualification'''
**A "warning" was given in the form of a [[Yellow card (sports)|yellow card]] or a [[Pride Fighting Championships#Victory|green card]] (The green card gave a 10% deduction of a fighter's purse) when a fighter committed an illegal action or did not follow the referee's instruction. Three warnings resulted in a disqualification
**A fighter was disqualified if a match was stopped, on the advice of the ring doctor, as a result of his deliberate illegal actions.
**The application of [[lubricant|oil]], [[ointment]], [[Aerosol spray|spray]], [[Petroleum jelly|Vaseline]], massaging cream, hair cream, or any other substances to any part of the fighter's body before and during the fights was prohibited. The discovery of any of these substances resulted in a disqualification.
* '''No contest'''
**In the event that both sides committed a violation of the rules, the bout would be declared a "no contest."
**If a fight was stopped on the advice of the ring doctor after an accidental but illegal action, i.e. a clash of heads, the match would be declared a no contest in the first round only

===Fouls===
Pride Fighting Championships considered the following to be fouls:
: [[headbutt|Head butting]]
: [[eye-gouging|Eye gouging]]
: Hair pulling
: Biting
: [[fish-hooking|Fish hooking]]
: [[groin attack|Any attacks to the groin]]
: Purposely striking the back of the head (if a punch was thrown and the fighter turned away letting it land on the back of his head it was okay), which included the occipital region and the spine. The sides of the head and the area around the ears were not considered to be the back of the head. (see [[Rabbit punch]])
: [[Small joint manipulation]] (control of four or more fingers or toes was necessary)
: [[elbow (strike)|Elbow strikes]] to the head and face
: Intentionally throwing the opponent out of the ring
: Running out of the ring
: Purposely holding the ropes. Fighters were not permitted to purposely hang an arm or leg on the ropes and it would result in an immediate warning.
: Stomps to a grounded fighter along with kicks and knees to the head of a grounded fighter, only in events in the US

In the event that a fighter was injured by illegal actions, then at the discretion of the referee and ring doctor, the round would attempt to be resumed after enough time had been given to the fighter to recover. Once the fight started again the fighters would be placed in the exact position when the referee called the time out. If the match could not be continued due to the severity of the injury then the fighter who perpetrated the action was disqualified.

===Match conduct===
* If both fighters were on the verge of falling out of the ring or became entangled in the ropes, the referee would stop the action. The fighters were required to immediately stop their movements and then would be repositioned in the center of the ring in the same relative position. Once they were comfortably repositioned, they would resume at the referee's instruction.
* Referees could give a fighter a [[penalty card]] for lack of activity. Every card, including warning cards, were a 10% deduction of a fighter's purse, this method was aimed to prevent inaction.

===Matches between fighters of different weight classes===
Pride made special provisions for fights between fighters of different weight classes or fighters with a large weight difference in the same weight class. The lighter fighter was given a choice of whether or not to permit knees or kicks to the face when in the "four points" position in the following cases:
*If both fighters were in the middleweight class and there was a weight difference of 10&amp;nbsp;kg/22&amp;nbsp;lb or more between the fighters.
*If the match was between a middleweight and heavyweight and there was a weight difference of 10&amp;nbsp;kg/22&amp;nbsp;lb or more between the fighters.
*If both fighters were in the heavyweight class and there was a weight difference of 15&amp;nbsp;kg/33&amp;nbsp;lb or more between the fighters.

===Pride Bushido===
The word BUSHIDO translates from the Japanese language as "the way of the warrior." More specifically, the term refers to the principals and moral code that developed among the samurai (military) class of Japan. Today, in the spirit of the samurai from Japan, PRIDE FC brings you the "way of the warrior" with its mixed martial arts event, BUSHIDO. Featuring a mixture of elite fighters as well as young up and coming talent, BUSHIDO presents the entire spectrum of weight classes, from lightweights to heavy weights. In addition, BUSHIDO provides flexibility for more experimental fight card formats, such as "team" competitions pitting country versus country, or fight team versus fight team. BUSHIDO also welcomes up and coming fighters, giving them an opportunity to prove themselves in BUSHIDO "Challenge Matches."
&lt;ref&gt;"PRIDEFC Official Website." PRIDEFC Official Website. N.p., n.d. Web. 09 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
There were a few minor differences from main Pride events:
*Bouts on Pride Bushido events consisted of two rounds; the first lasting ten minutes and the second lasting five. Intermissions between each round were two minutes in length.
*Bushido "Challenge Matches" consisted of two rounds lasting five minutes each. Intermissions between each round were two minutes in length.
*In Bushido, red cards were issued in a similar way that yellow cards were used in Pride FC. A red card resulted in a 10% deduction of the fighter's fight purse. Red cards could be given out in an unlimited number without disqualification. If fighters committed the following actions, they were to be given a red card by officials:
**stalling or failure to initiate any offensive attack
**making no attempt to finalize the match or damage the opponent
**holding the opponent's body with the arms and legs to produce a stalemate

===Differences from the ''Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts''===
Some states' athletic commissions require mixed martial arts events to modify rules to match the ''[[Mixed martial arts rules|Mixed Martial Arts Unified Rules of Combat]]'', as introduced by the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board, and adopted by the Nevada State Athletic Commission in order to receive state sanctioning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html Mixed Martial Arts Unified Rules of Conduct, Additional Mixed Martial Arts Rules], New Jersey Athletic Control Board. Retrieved April 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: CHAPTER 467 - UNARMED COMBAT]. Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved December 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Pride's rules differed from the ''Unified Rules of Combat'' in the following ways:
*Pride allowed kicking and [[knee (strike)|kneeing]] the head of a [[downed opponent]]. This is considered a foul in the unified rules, which only allows kicks and knees to the head of a standing opponent.
*Pride allowed a fighter to [[stomp (strike)|stomp]] the head of a downed opponent. This is considered a foul in the unified rules.
*Pride allowed a fighter to spike ([[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledrive]]) an opponent onto the canvas on his head or neck. This is considered a foul in the unified rules.
*Pride did not allow [[elbow (strike)|elbow strikes]] to the head of an opponent. The unified rules allow elbows provided they are not [[12-6 elbow|striking directly down with the point of the elbow (12 o'clock to 6 o'clock)]].
*Pride's matches included a ten-minute first round, with two-minute rest periods. The unified rules allow rounds no longer than five minutes, with rest periods not exceeding one minute.
*Pride's matches were not judged on the ten-point must system, rather judges scored the whole fight. The unified rules call for all matches to be judged using the ten-point must system.

At the announcement on March 27, 2007, that the Fertittas were purchasing Pride, it was stated that all future Pride events (after Pride 34) would be held under unified rules, eliminating 10-minute opening rounds, ground knees, stomps and more, though there were no more Pride events held to use these rules.&lt;ref name="MMAWeekly"&gt;[http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=3676&amp;zoneid=13 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513020720/http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=3676&amp;zoneid=13 |date=May 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pride events==
{{main|List of Pride events}}
Events typically begin with the [[theme music]] entitled ''Pride'', composed by [[Yasuharu Takanashi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pridefc.com/pride2005/whats_faq_06.htm |title=PRIDE |publisher=Pridefc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their main, "numbered" events, Pride have staged other series of events for different purposes.

===Pride Grand Prix===
The Pride GP (Grand Prix) is the name of a series of tournaments held by Pride. In addition to a money prize, a championship belt was given to the winner of each tournament, though this belt only denoted the tournament winner and would never be defended. However, Pride's [[Pride Shockwave 2005|Shockwave 2005]] event crowned not only the welterweight and lightweight tournament champions, but also Pride's inaugural welterweight and lightweight champions. Of note is the amount of past and future [[champion]]s that would participate in these tournaments.

In 2000, Pride held their first Grand Prix. With no weight limits, it is now considered to be their first openweight grand prix. Held across two events, [[Pride Grand Prix 2000 Opening Round]] featured first round bouts and [[Pride Grand Prix 2000 Finals]] featured the quarter finals, semi finals and final.

The concept was brought back in 2003, with a middleweight grand prix. Held across two cards, [[2003 in Pride FC#Pride Total Elimination 2003|Pride Total Elimination 2003]] featured the first round of the Grand Prix and [[Pride Final Conflict 2003|Final Conflict 2003]] featured the semi finals and final. Subsequent middleweight, heavyweight and openweight grands prix had taken place across three events when, in [[Pride Critical Countdown 2004|2004, Critical Countdown]] was introduced for second round bouts. Both Critical Countdown and Final Conflict had a mix of Grand Prix and non-Grand Prix matches.

In 2007, it was announced that Pride would hold only one Grand Prix a year and it would rotate between each of their four established weight classes.&lt;ref name="2007changes" /&gt;

====Format====
Except for the inaugural 2000 Grand Prix, tournament dates with only one round would adhere to normal Pride or Pride Bushido rules. For tournament dates that held two rounds, a fight had a 10-minute first round, followed by a two-minute rest period for the fighters, and then a five-minute last round.

=====Exceptions=====
The [[Pride Grand Prix 2000 Finals|2000 Finals]] held a 90-minute contest between [[Kazushi Sakuraba]] and [[Royce Gracie]]. Gracie had requested that there be no judging and no limit to the number of rounds. Sakuraba agreed to fight under these rules, and the contest went to a total of 90 minutes of fighting, after which Gracie's corner threw in the towel due to damage to Gracie's legs. Sakuraba advanced to the next round, fighting a fifteen-minute first round against eventual runner up [[Igor Vovchanchyn]], after which Sakuraba's corner threw in the towel citing his exhaustion.

===Pride Bushido===
With Pride's numbered shows and Grands Prix focused on heavier fighters, in October 2003, Pride started a series of events entitled "Bushido". With the focus on lighter combatants, two weight classes, lightweight and welterweight, were formed at 73 and 83&amp;nbsp;kg respectively. After Pride Bushido 13, it was announced that the series would end and these weight classes would transfer to main Pride shows.

In 2005, Pride Bushido staged welterweight and lightweight Grands Prix. Two eight-man brackets were set up and the quarter finals and semi finals were held at [[Pride Bushido 9]], along with an alternate bout in each bracket. The finals were held at [[Pride Shockwave 2005]], with the winners subsequently being crowned as champions for their division. A sixteen-man welterweight grand prix was held in 2006.

===Pride The Best===
In 2002, Pride launched ''The Best'', a series of shows featuring up-and-coming fighters, using an eight-sided roped ring. However, after the third show in October 2002, the series was discontinued. The concept was later refined into the Pride Bushido events.

==Final champions==
{{main|List of Pride champions}}

When Zuffa LLC bought Pride, it moved to unify the Pride middleweight and welterweight titles with its own light-heavyweight (205&amp;nbsp;lbs) and middleweight (185&amp;nbsp;lbs) titles. Dan Henderson, who held both the Pride middleweight and welterweight belts at the time of the Zuffa buy-out, was beaten in two unification bouts, first to Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson in September 2007 and then to middleweight Anderson Silva in March 2008.

The titleholders below were those who held the titles on April 8, 2007, the date of the last Pride FC promoted show.

'''Pub names''' are used to identify and differentiate [[pub]]s. Many pubs are centuries old, from a time when their customers were often [[illiterate]], but could recognise pictorial signs. Pub names have a variety of origins, from objects used as simple identification marks to the coats of arms of kings or local aristocrats and landowners. Other names come from historic events, livery companies, and occupations or craftsmen's guilds.

Unlike Ireland, where the names of pubs tend to be based on the name of the owner, or a former owner, in mainland Britain this has been unusual, probably because pubs wanted names that could be related to an image on their [[pub sign]], a key means of identifying them in an age of restricted literacy. In Australia a high proportion of older pubs have names ending in "hotel", and generally their names reflect hotel naming conventions.  

==Methodology==
Although the word ''The'' appears on much pub signage, it is not considered to be an important part of the name, and is therefore ignored in the following examples. The word ''Ye'' is likewise ignored as it is only an archaic spelling of ''The''.  Y represents an obsolete character (þ, the [[Thorn (letter)|letter Thorn]], which is nowadays used only in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]) for the ''th'' sound and its later forms looked rather like a [[blackletter]] ''y''. It was never pronounced with a y sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ye%5B2%5D |title=Ye |accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other archaic spellings such as "olde worlde" are not distinguished below.

==Animals==

Names like ''Fox and Hounds'', ''Dog and Duck'', ''Dog and Gun'', etc., refer to hunting.&lt;ref name=TimeTravel1/&gt; Animal names coupled with colours, such as ''White Hart'' and ''Red Lion'', are often heraldic. A white hart featured as the badge of [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]], while a red lion was the badge of [[John of Gaunt]] and a blue boar of the [[Earl of Oxford|Earls of Oxford]].&lt;ref name=Simpson249&gt;{{cite book |last=Simpson |first=Jacqueline |title=Green Men &amp; White Swans: The Folklore of British Pub Names |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ot6AzT3fO6AC&amp;pg=PA249 |year=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-09-952017-7 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Please do not add anything here without a citation, we need more refs not more uncited text--&gt;

==Branding==
Some pub chains in the UK adopt the same or similar names for many pubs as a means of brand expression. The principal examples of this are "The Moon Under Water", commonly used by the [[JD Wetherspoon]] chain, and inspired by [[George Orwell]]'s 1946 essay in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', "[[The Moon Under Water]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Waterhouse, Keith]] [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1039934/The-Moon-Under-Water-goes-under.html "The Moon Under Water goes under"] ''[[Daily Mail]]''&lt;/ref&gt;) and the "Tap and Spile" brand name used by the now defunct [[Century Inns]] chain. The [[Slug and Lettuce (pub chain)|"Slug and Lettuce"]] is another example of a chain of food-based pubs with a prominent brand—founder Hugh Corbett had owned a small number of pubs, which he rechristened with humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors.

==Found objects==
[[File:The 'Crooked Billet', Worsthorne, Lancashire - geograph.org.uk - 553587.jpg|thumb|The 'Crooked Billet', [[Worsthorne]], Lancashire]]

Before painted inn signs became commonplace, medieval publicans often identify their establishment by hanging or standing a distinctive object outside the pub. This tradition dates back to Roman times, when the owners of [[tabernae]] used to hang some vine leaves outside their property to show where wine was sold.&lt;ref name="HUK"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Ben|title=Pub Signs of Britain|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/Pub-Signs-of-Britain/|publisher=Historic UK|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Boot
* Copper Kettle
* Crooked Billet (a bent branch from a tree)
&lt;!--Please do not add anything here without a citation, we need more refs not more uncited text--&gt;

Sometimes the object was coloured, such as ''Blue Post'' or ''Blue Door''.&lt;ref name="Dict"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k-4SrdUPNFoC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=pub+names&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a |title=Dictionary of Pub Names |publisher=books.google.co.uk |accessdate=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heraldry==
The ubiquity of the naming element ''arms'' shows how important [[heraldry]] has been in the naming of pubs. The simpler symbols of the [[heraldic badge]]s of royalty or local nobility give rise to many of the most common pub names.

===Items appearing in coats of arms===
[[File:The White Hart Signboard.jpg|thumb|upright|A White Hart signboard]]

* Antlers: although this is often seen as a derivation of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]'s white [[Deer|hart]] emblem, it may also be an echo of a pagan figure, [[Herne the Hunter]].
* Bear and Ragged Staff: a badge of the [[earl of Warwick|earls of Warwick]]. Refers to [[bear baiting]] (see ''Dog and Bear'' in the Sports section).
* Black Griffin: a pub in [[Lisvane]], [[Cardiff]], named after the coat of arms carried by the lords of the manor.
* Old Black Lion is the name of an ancient pub opposite the railway station in [[Northampton]].
* Blue Boar, the name of many pubs in [[Westminster]], [[Norwich]], [[Billericay]], [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]], [[Witney]] and elsewhere, from the badge of the [[Earl of Oxford|Earls of Oxford]].&lt;ref name=Simpson249/&gt;
* Castle: sometimes originally referred to the [[Kingdom of Castile#Arms of the Kingdom of Castile|Coat of Arms of Castile]] in [[Spain]], and meant that Spanish wines were available within.&lt;ref name="Sign"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wordsworth Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|year=2001|page=883}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Checkers or Chequers: often derived from the [[coat of arms]] of a local landowner (see [[Chequy]]), this name and sign originated in ancient Rome when a chequer board indicated that a bar also provided banking services. The checked board was used as an aid to counting and is the origin of the word ''[[exchequer]]''. The last pub to use the older, now American spelling of ''checker'' was in [[Baldock]], Hertfordshire, but this closed circa 1990; all pubs now use the modern "q" spelling (but see also [[Sorbus torminalis|Chequers]], in [[Pub names#Plants and horticulture|Plants and horticulture]] below).
* [[Eagle and Child]], [[Oxford]], derived from the arms of the [[Earls of Derby]], was a meeting place of the [[Inklings]].
* [[Elephant and Castle#Name|Elephant and Castle]]: apocryphally a corruption of the words "Infanta of Castile", more probably taken from the crest of the [[Worshipful Company of Cutlers|Cutlers' Company]].
* Lamb and Flag: a common religious symbol, with the [[Agnus Dei]] holding the red cross flag that represented the [[Resurrection of Christ]] earlier than it was the flag of England. This was the device of the [[Honourable Society of the Middle Temple|Middle Temple]], a legal society in London, which was given a charter in 1608 to occupy lands formerly owned by the [[Knights Templar]]. It is one of the four [[Inns of Court]], still training [[barrister]]s today. The [[Lamb &amp; Flag (Oxford)]] is one of many pubs with this name.
* [[Ye Olde Man &amp; Scythe|Olde Man and Scythe]], [[Bolton]], taken from the crest of the [[Pilkington of Lancashire|Pilkington]] family.
* Ostrich feathers have been used as a royal badge since the time of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], particularly the [[Prince of Wales's feathers|''Three Feathers'' badge]] of the [[Prince of Wales]].
* [[y Ddraig Goch|Red Dragon]] of [[Cadwaladr]]: the [[flag of Wales|symbol of Wales]], and a heraldic badge of Henry VII and many other royal figures.
* {{anchor|Red Lion}}Red Lion is the name of over 600 pubs. It thus can stand for an [[archetype|archetypal]] British pub. The lion is one of the most common [[charge (heraldry)|charges]] in [[coats of arms]], second only to the [[Cross (heraldry)|cross]], and thus the Red Lion as a pub sign probably has multiple origins: in the arms or [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] of a local landowner, now perhaps forgotten; as a personal badge of [[John of Gaunt]], founder of the [[House of Lancaster]]; or in the [[royal arms of Scotland]], conjoined to the arms of England after the Stuart succession in 1603.&lt;ref name="Pubnames"&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Leslie Dunkling|Dunkling L]], Wright G |title=The Wordsworth Dictionary of Pub Names |year=1994|origyear=1987 |publisher= Wordsworth Reference|location=Ware, Hertfordshire |isbn=1-85326-334-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Simpson249/&gt;
* Rising Sun: symbol of the east and of optimism.  The [[Sun (heraldry)|Sun In Splendour]] was also a [[livery badge]] of Edward IV
* Silver Lion, [[Lilley, Hertfordshire]]: from the arms of the Sowerby family.
* Spread Eagle: from the heraldic depiction of an [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle 'displayed']]; probably derived from the arms of [[Germany]], indicating that German wines were available within.&lt;ref name="Sign" /&gt;
* Swan, a badge of many [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] figures—see [[Dunstable Swan Jewel]]
* [[Talbot (dog)|Talbot]] or Talbot Arms refers to an actual breed of hunting dog, now extinct, which is also a heraldic hound, and is the badge of the [[Baron Talbot|Talbot family]], [[Earls of Shrewsbury]].
* [[Unicorn]]
* White [[Bear]]
* [[White Hart]]: the [[livery badge]] of King [[Richard II of England]]. It became so popular as an inn sign in his reign that it was adopted by many later inns and taverns.&lt;ref name=Simpson249/&gt;
* [[Saxon Steed|White Horse]]: the sign of the [[House of Hanover]], adopted by many eighteenth-century [[White Horse Tavern (disambiguation)|inns]] to demonstrate loyalty to the new Royal dynasty. A white [[horse]] is also the emblem of the County of [[Kent]]. The name can also refer to the [[Chalk figures in the United Kingdom|chalk horses]] carved into hillsides.
* [[White Lion]]: the [[livery badge]] of the [[Duke of Norfolk]]

===Livery companies===
[[File:Three Compasses, Hornsey, N8 (2509772818).jpg|thumb|upright|Three Compasses, Hornsey, London N8]]

Names starting with the word "Three" are often based on the arms of a London [[Livery company]] or trade [[guild]] :
* Three Arrows: The [[Worshipful Company of Bowyers]]
* Three Bucks: The [[Worshipful Company of Leathersellers]]
* Three Castles: The [[Worshipful Company of Masons]]
* Three Compasses: The [[Worshipful Company of Carpenters]]
* Three Crowns: The [[Worshipful Company of Drapers]], although it can also refer to the [[Magi]], or the [[Diocese of Ely]]
* Three Cups: The [[Worshipful Company of Salters]]
* Three Goats' Heads: The [[Worshipful Company of Cordwainers]]
* Three Hammers: The [[Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths]]
* Three Horseshoes: The [[Worshipful Company of Farriers]]
* Three Tuns: The [[Brewer]]s and the [[Worshipful Company of Vintners]]
* Three Wheatsheafs: The [[Worshipful Company of Bakers]]
&lt;!--Please do not add anything here without a citation, we need more refs not more uncited text--&gt;

===Landowners===
Many [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] appear as pub signs, usually honouring a local landowner.
* Percy Arms, [[Otterburn, Northumberland]], commemorates the [[Battle of Otterburn]] in 1388, where [[Henry 'Hotspur' Percy|Sir Henry Percy]], son of the [[Earl of Northumberland]], led the English army. There is also a Percy Arms in [[Tynemouth, North Tyneside]], and various other locations in the [[North East of England]].
* Stanley Arms, [[Huyton]], near [[Liverpool]]: after [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby]].
* Melbourne Arms, [[Duston]], [[Northampton]]: after former local landowner [[Lord Melbourne]]

===Occupations&lt;!--'Arms' pubs ONLY--&gt;===
[[File:The Mechanics Arms, Hindley Green - geograph.org.uk - 77601.jpg|thumb|The Mechanics Arms, Hindley Green]]

:''See also [[Pub names#Trades, tools and products|Trades, tools and products]] below''
Some "Arms" signs refer to working occupations. These may show people undertaking such work or the arms of the appropriate London [[livery company]]. This class of name may be only just a name but there are stories behind some of them.

* Artillery Arms [[Bunhill Row]], [[London]] EC1: situated next door to the headquarters of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]], the [[British Army]]'s oldest regiment.
* Blacksmith's Arms, with the pun of the actual blacksmiths arms and their strength

==Historic events==
* Alma: commemorating the [[Battle of Alma|Battle of the Alma]] which took place in 1854, during the [[Crimean War]].
* Bhurtpore Inn, Aston, near Nantwich, Cheshire: commemorating the [[Siege of Bharatpur]] in Rajasthan, 1826.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhurtpore.co.uk/history.htm see pub website, history page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024604/http://www.bhurtpore.co.uk/history.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Inn is on land formerly part of the estates of [[Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere|Lord Combermere]], commander of British forces during the siege.
{{anchor|Dolphin}}
* Dolphin: often anglicised from the French ''[[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]]'', commemorating battles in which England defeated France.  These include "The Dolphin" in [[Wellington, Somerset]] which was named in honour of Wellington's victory at the [[Battle of Waterloo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedolphinwellington.co.uk |title=The Dolphin - Wellington, Somerset - Home |work=thedolphinwellington.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{see also|Dolphin Inn, Plymouth}}
* Festival Inn: name of a pub in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], London, built at the time of the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951.
* [[Hand and Shears]]: this famous [[City of London]] pub got its name owing to [[Bartholomew Fair]].  Tailors would gather in the pub the night before the fair and wave their shears announcing that the fair should begin.&lt;ref name="hand"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rennison, Nick |title=The Book of Lists, London |publisher=Canongate |year=2006 |page=10 |isbn=978-1-84195-934-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Magna Charta in [[Lowdham]], Nottinghamshire, has its name spelled differently from the [[Magna Carta|historic document]] after which it is named.
* Man on the Moon, [[Northfield, Birmingham]]: originally called ''The Man in the Moon'' and renamed on the day of the first moon landing in 1969.
* Rose and Crown:  [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] used a golden rose as a personal badge, and two of his sons adapted it by changing the colour: [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]], used a red rose, and [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York]], used a white rose. The dynastic conflicts between their descendants are collectively called the [[Wars of the Roses]]. In 1485 [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], a descendant of Lancaster, defeated [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] of the York dynasty and married Richard's niece [[Elizabeth of York]]. Since then the combined red-and-white [[Tudor rose]], often crowned, has been a symbol of the monarchy of England.

[[File:Royal Oak Pub, Fishguard, Wales, UK.JPG|thumb|lright|A 'Royal Oak' in [[Fishguard]], [[Wales]]]]
{{anchor|Royal Oak}}
* [[Royal Oak]]: After the [[Battle of Worcester]] (1651) in the [[English Civil War]], the defeated Prince Charles escaped the scene with the [[Roundheads]] on his tail. He managed to reach [[Bishops Wood]] in [[Staffordshire]], where he found an [[oak]] tree (now known as the Boscobel Oak near [[Boscobel House]]). He climbed the tree and hid in it for a day while his obviously short-sighted pursuers strolled around under the tree looking for him. The hunters gave up, Prince Charles came down and escaped to France (the [[Escape of Charles II]]). He became [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] on the [[English Restoration|Restoration of the Monarchy]]. To celebrate this good fortune, 29 May (Charles' birthday) was declared Royal Oak Day and the pub name remembers this. The [[Royal Navy|Royal Naval]] ship [[HMS Royal Oak]] gets its name from the same source. Early ships were built of the heartwood of [[oak]].
[[File:Ye Old Trip to Jerusalem 2005.jpg|thumb|Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem]]
* Saracen's Head and Turk's Head: [[Saracen]]s and [[Turkish people|Turks]] were among the enemies faced by [[Crusade]]rs. This is also a reference to the [[Barbary pirates]] that raided the coasts from the Crusades until the early 19th century.
* Trafalgar: commemorating the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. There are many pubs called the [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]], and an [[Emma Hamilton]] pub in Wimbledon Chase where Nelson lived with her. A famous pub is the [[Trafalgar Tavern]], part of the Greenwich Maritime World Heritage site at Greenwich.
* [[Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem|Olde Trip to Jerusalem]], [[Nottingham]], one of the claimants to the title of oldest pub in Britain, said to have been a stopping-off place for the [[Crusade]]rs on the way to the [[Holy Land]]. "Trip" here has the old meaning of a stop, not the modern journey. The pub was once called the ''Pilgrim'', which is probably the real story behind the name. The pub has the date 1189 painted on its masonry, which is the year [[King Richard I]] ascended to the throne. Like many elderly pubs, the Trip carries "Ye" before its name, with an E on the end of "old" another "olde worlde" affectation.

==Myths and legends==
Images from [[mythology|myth]]s and [[legend]]s are evocative and memorable.
* Black Horse (Black Bess): usually named after the legendary overnight ride from London to York in 1737 by [[Dick Turpin]]. This fictional account was popularised in a novel, ''[[Rookwood (novel)|Rookwood]]'' (1834), resulting in a surge of Dick Turpin nostalgia and associated pub names.
* [[Fiddler's Green]], a legendary place in the afterlife where existence consists of all leisure and no work.
* George and Dragon: [[St George]] is the [[patron saint]] of [[England]] and his conflict with a [[dragon]] is essential to his story. This sign is a symbol of [[English nationalism]].
* [[Green Man]]: a spirit of the wild woods.&lt;ref name=Temples&gt;{{cite web |author1=Rowan |title=The Temples of John Barleycorn |url=http://www.whitedragon.org.uk/articles/john.htm |publisher=White Dragon |accessdate=9 September 2016 |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original images are in churches as a face peering through or made of leaves and petals; this character is the [[Will of the Wisp]], the Jack of the Green. Some pub signs will show the green man as he appears in English traditional sword dances (in green hats). The Green Man is not the same character as [[Robin Hood]], although the two may be linked. Some pubs which were the ''Green Man'' have become the ''Robin Hood''; there are no pubs in Robin's own county of [[Nottinghamshire]] named the ''Green Man'' but there are ''Robin Hood''s. The 1973 film ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]'' features a Green Man pub.
* [[Moonrakers]]: In the 17th century, some Wiltshire yokels hid their smuggled liquor in the Crammer (a pond in [[Devizes]]) and used rakes to recover their stash. They were caught in the act by customs officials and they claimed they were trying to rake in a cheese, which was in fact the reflection of the full moon. The customs officials left thinking that the locals were a bit simple, whilst the locals recovered the smuggled goods without any more interference. The name Moonrakers has been used as a nickname for [[Wiltshire]] folk ever since and is the name of pubs in Devizes and [[Swindon]].
* [[Robin Hood]], sometimes partnered by his second in charge to form the name Robin Hood and [[Little John]]. Other Robin Hood names can be found throughout [[Arnold, Nottinghamshire]]. These were given to pubs built in the new estates of the 1960s by the Home Brewery of Daybrook, Nottinghamshire: ''Arrow'', ''[[Friar Tuck]]'', ''Longbow'', ''[[Maid Marian]]'' and ''[[Major Oak]]''.
* Silent Woman, Quiet Lady or Headless Woman: The origin is uncertain, with various local stories, such as a landlady whose tongue was cut out by smugglers so she couldn't talk to the authorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesilentwoman.co.uk/ |title=The Silent Woman Inn - Welcome to The Silent Woman |publisher=www.thesilentwoman.co.uk |accessdate=15 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a saint beheaded for her Christianity.&lt;ref name=dick&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k-4SrdUPNFoC&amp;pg=PA354&amp;dq=silent+woman+pub+saint&amp;ei=Pza4TO_XC8-Aswa7rtzGDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Dictionary of Pub Names |page=354 |publisher=Wordsworth Editions|year= 2006|isbn=1-84022-266-2 |accessdate=15 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pub signs sometimes have an image of a [[decapitation|decapitated]] woman or the couplet: "Here is a woman who has lost her head / She's quiet now—you see she's dead".&lt;ref name=dick/&gt;
* Captain's Wife, near the medieval trading port of [[Sully Island|Swanbridge]] on the south Wales coast near [[Penarth]]. The pub was converted during the 1970s from a row of fishermen's cottages. There is a local legend of a ghostly wife keeping endless vigil after her husband's boat was lost in a storm.

==Paired names==

Common enough today, the pairing of words in the name of an inn or tavern was rare before the mid-17th century, but by 1708 had become frequent enough for a pamphlet to complain of 'the variety and contradictory language of the signs', citing absurdities such as 'Bull and Mouth', 'Whale and Cow', and 'Shovel and Boot'. Two years later an essay in the ''[[The Spectator (1711)|Spectator]]'' echoed this complaint, deriding among others such contemporary paired names as 'Bell and Neat's Tongue', though accepting 'Cat and Fiddle'. A possible explanation for doubling of names is the combining of businesses, for example when a landlord of one pub moved to another premises. Fashion, as in the rise of intentionally amusing paired names like '[[Slug and Lettuce]]' and 'Frog and Firkin' (see ''Puns, Jokes and Corruptions'' below) in the late 20th century, is responsible for many more recent pub names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jacqueline Simpson |title=Green Men and White Swans |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-1-84794-515-0 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal names or titles==

[[File:MarquessOfGranby.JPG|right|thumb|150px|The Marquis of Granby, after whom a number of pubs are named.]]
Some pubs are known by the names of former landlords and landladies, for instance Nellie's (originally the White Horse) in [[Beverley]], and [[Ma Pardoe's]] (officially the Olde Swan) in [[Netherton, West Midlands]]. The Baron of Beef, [[Welwyn]], [[Hertfordshire]] is named after a nineteenth-century landlord, George Baron, listed in [[Kelly's Directory]] for 1890 as "Butcher and Beer Retailer". Others are named after various people.

[[File:Hoop and Grapes - London's Oldest Pub^ - geograph.org.uk - 543347.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Hoop and Grapes, Aldgate|Hoop and Grapes]], Aldgate High Street, London]]

The most common tree-based pub name is the Royal Oak, which refers to a [[Royal Oak|Historical event]].

*  Bush, [[Holly]] Bush, [[Mulberry]] Bush etc. refer to plants, but note that Bull and Bush refers to a battle (see [[Royal Oak|Historical event]] above).
*  Chequers from the [[Sorbus torminalis|Wild Service Tree]] or "Chequer(s) Tree", the fruit of which was used to flavour beer before the introduction of [[hops]].
* Crabtree would refer to a [[crab apple]] tree growing nearby or in the grounds, as pubs are often free standing.
*  Flower Pot, [[Maidstone]], Kent, [[Aston]], Oxfordshire, [[Henley-on-Thames]]. Flowerpots, [[Cheriton, Hampshire]].
* Hand and Flower, [[Hammersmith]], London, also [[Ham, London|Ham]], Surrey. Hand and Flowers, [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]].
* Major Oak, [[Nottingham]]. Named after an [[Major Oak|ancient tree]], and locally associated with [[Robin Hood]]
* Pineapple, e.g. in [[The Pineapple, Kentish Town]], also [[Berkshire]] and [[Oldham]].
*  Tulip, [[Chelmsford]].
* Vine or Grapes possibly harks back to the Roman custom of displaying a vine outside a tavern or wine-shop, as in [[Hoop and Grapes, Aldgate|The Hoop and Grapes]] in [[Aldgate]] High Street, London (reputed to be the city's oldest pub).

==Politically incorrect==

* All labour in vain or Labour in vain. At various locations. Probably of Biblical origins, in past times the name was often illustrated by a person trying to scrub the blackness off a black child. Such signs, now deemed offensive, have been mostly replaced with more innocuous depictions of wasted effort.&lt;ref&gt;"The present sign is the innocuous replacement for one that became the centre of a storm a dozen or so years ago. As readers may remember, the original illustration was of a white couple trying to scrub the blackness off a black child in a tub. It was deemed by many to be in poor taste and potentially offensive, but there was an outcry when it was removed following a protest by two schoolgirls." [http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/cheadle/news/Labour-Vain-Yarnfield-Cookman-Review/article-234797-detail/article.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are numerous old pubs and inns in England with the name of the Black Boy, many now claimed to refer either to child chimneysweeps or coal miners, or to a (genuine) historic description of King Charles II. The [[Black Boy Inn]], Caernarfon, North Wales, has received at least a dozen complaints from visitors over the name, which dates back at least 250 years. However, the police say they have not received any formal complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/2008/04/04/is-historic-black-boy-pub-racist-55578-20718901/|title=News: The latest North Wales news from the Daily Post|website=www.dailypost.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Black Bitch, a pub in [[Linlithgow]], West Lothian, is named after the local legend of a black [[greyhound]] who is said to have repeatedly swum to an island in the town's loch to bring food to its imprisoned master, only to suffer the same fate when its efforts were discovered. The pub's name has caused more than a few surprised tourists to question the name or decry it as racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/what-mr-scott-was-black-bitch-1-1340540|title=What!

==The pub itself (including nicknames)==

===The pub building===
[[File:The Crooked House, Dudley - geograph.org.uk - 96790.jpg|thumb|[[The Crooked House]], [[Himley]], known for its extreme lean, caused by [[coal mining|mining]] subsidence]]

* Candlestick, West End, [[Essendon, Hertfordshire]]: Once the Chequers, lit by a single candle and plunged into darkness when the landlord took the candle to the cellar to fetch beer.
* Crooked Chimney, [[Lemsford]], Hertfordshire: The pub's [[chimney]] is distinctively crooked.
* [[The Crooked House|Crooked House]], nickname of the Glynne Arms, [[Himley]], Staffordshire. Because of mining [[subsidence]], one side of the pub has a pronounced list.
* Cupola House, [[Bury St Edmunds]], Suffolk, has a [[cupola]] on its roof.
* Hole in the Wall. The official name or nickname of a number of very small pubs. One such at [[Waterloo, London]], is spacious but built into a railway viaduct.
* Jackson Stops, [[Stretton, Rutland]]: The pub was once closed for a period when the only sign on the outside was that of London [[estate agent]] Jackson Stops. The name stuck.
* [[Kilt and Clover]], [[Port Dalhousie, Ontario]], named after the owners. The husband is of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent, and the wife is of [[Irish people|Irish]] heritage. The split theme runs throughout the pub.
* New Inn. Pubs can bear this name for centuries.
* Nutshell, [[Bury St Edmunds]]: one of the foremost claimants to be the smallest pub in the UK and maybe the world.
* Push Inn, [[Beverley]]: At one time the pub had no external sign except for that on the entrance door which read, simply, PUSH.
* Red House, [[Newport Pagnell]], and on the old A43 between [[Northampton]] and [[Kettering]]: red or reddish painted buildings.
* Swiss Cottage was built in [[Swiss chalet style]]. It gave its name to an [[Swiss Cottage tube station|underground station]] and an [[Swiss Cottage|area of London]].
* Swiss Gardens, [[Shoreham-by-Sea]], originally the pub of a Swiss-themed Victorian picnic garden and [[amusement park]].
* Vaults, a number of pubs, not all having [[vault (architecture)|vault]]s as an architectural feature; the word also had the general meaning of 'storeroom'.&lt;ref&gt;'A place of this kind used as a cellar or storeroom for provisions or liquors.' Oxford English Dictionary, Second edition, 1989; online version June 2011. &lt;http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/221743&gt;; accessed 1 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; By extension 'the vaults' was formerly used to designate a particular type of bar. At a time (mid 19th-mid 20th century) when the several areas in a pub served different clientele, 'the vaults' would cater largely for working-class drinkers and would most usually be men-only.
* White Elephant, [[Northampton]], [[Northamptonshire]]. Originally built as a hotel to accommodate visitors to the adjacent Northampton Racecourse, the building became a "[[white elephant]]" (useless object) when horse racing was stopped at Northampton Racecourse in 1904.

===Beer and wine===
[[File:The Barley Mow, Clifton Hampden (wide).jpg|thumb|The Barley Mow, [[Clifton Hampden]]]]

Many traditional pub names refer to the drinks available inside, most often beer.

* Barley Mow: a stack (or sheaf) of [[barley]], the principal grain from which beer is made.
* [[Barrel]]s: A [[cask]] or [[keg]] containing 36 Imperial [[gallon]]s of liquid, especially beer. Other sizes include: ''pin'', 36 pints; [[English brewery cask units#Firkin|firkin]], 9 gallons; [[kilderkin]], 18 gallons; half-hogshead, 27 gallons; [[hogshead]], 54 gallons; [[butt (volume)|butt]], probably 104 gallons.
* Brewery Tap: A pub originally found on site or adjacent to a [[brewery]] and often showcasing its products to visitors; although, now that so many breweries have closed, the house may be nowhere near an open brewery.
* Cock and Bottle, or simply Cock: The [[stopcock]] used to serve beer from a barrel, and a beer bottle.&lt;ref name=BritainExpress&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britainexpress.com/History/culture/pub-names.htm |title=British Pub Signs - a short history |publisher=Britain Express |first=Elaine |last=Saunders |date= |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[hops|Hop]] Inn: Hop flowers are the ingredient in beer which gives it its bitter taste, though this name is often intended as a [[pun]].
* Hop Pole: The poles which support wires or ropes up which hops grow in the field.
* (Sir) [[John Barleycorn]]: A character of English traditional folk music and [[folklore]], similar to a [[Green Man]]. He is annually cut down at the ankles, thrashed, but always reappears—an allegory of growth and harvest based on [[barley]].
* Leather(n) Bottle: A container in which a small amount of beer or wine was transported, now replaced by a bottle or can.
* Malt Shovel: A [[shovel]] used in a malting to turn over the barley grain.

===Food===
[[File:Yeoldcheshirecheese.jpg|thumb|upright|Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, [[Fleet Street]], [[London]]]]

Other pub names refer to items of food to tempt the hungry traveller. For example, [[The Baron of Beef]] in Cambridge refers to a double sirloin joined at the backbone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/life/britains-strangest-pub-names/the-baron-of-beef-in-cambridge/ | title=Britain's strangest pub names  | newspaper=Daily Telegraph | date= 15 Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Puns, jokes and corruptions==

[[File:The Nowhere Inn Particular, Sumner Road, Crodyon.JPG|thumb|Pub heritage: Nowhere Inn Particular, now closed]]
Although [[pun]]s became increasingly popular through the twentieth century, they should be considered with care. Supposed corruptions of foreign phrases usually have much simpler explanations. Many old names for pubs that appear nonsensical are often alleged to have come from corruptions of slogans or phrases, such as "The Bag o'Nails" (Bacchanals), "The Cat and the Fiddle" (Caton Fidele) and "The Bull and Bush", which purportedly celebrates the victory of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] at "Boulogne Bouche" or [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] Harbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bartleby.com/81/13751.html | author = Brewer, E. Cobham |title= Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|year= 1898 | accessdate = 17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k-4SrdUPNFoC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=pub+names&amp;q= |title=Dictionary of Pub Names – Google Books |publisher=books.google.co.uk |accessdate=31 August 2009 |last=|first= |isbn=978-1-84022-266-1 |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, these corruptions evoke a visual image which comes to signify the pub; these images had particular importance for identifying a pub on signs and other media before [[literacy]] became widespread. Sometimes the basis of a nickname is not the name, but its pictorial representation on the sign that becomes corrupt, through weathering, or unskillful paintwork by an amateur artist. Apparently, many pubs called the Cat or Cat and Custard Pot were originally Tigers or Red Lions with signs that "looked more like a cat" in the opinion of locals.

* Axe and Gate: Possibly from "''ax'' (or ''ask'') ''and get''".&lt;ref name="Wedgwood"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=74|year=1855|issue=6|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bag o'Nails: Thought by the romantic to be a corrupted version of "[[Bacchanal]]s" but really is just a sign once used by [[ironmonger]]s. The pub of this name in [[Bristol, England]] was named in the 1990s for the former reason, though the latter is more prevalent.
* Barge Inn. A play on words 'barge in'. The Barge Inn in [[Bradford-on-Avon]], Wiltshire is however actually on a canal, where barges tie up.
* Beartown Tap, [[Congleton]], [[Cheshire]]. 'Beartown' is the nickname for Congleton, as local legend claims its townsfolk once 'sold the bible to buy the bear', that is, spent money set aside to buy a parish Bible on providing [[bear-baiting]] at their fair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congleton-cheshire.co.uk/beartown.htm] Congleton history website&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bent Brief, once close to the Honest Lawyer on Lodge Road, [[Southampton]].
* Bird and Baby, the familiar name used by the [[Inklings]] for the [[Eagle and Child]] pub in Oxford (see above under Heraldry).
* Buck and Ear in the [[Steveston, British Columbia|Steveston]] area of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], [[British Columbia]]. The name alludes not only to the maritime heritage of the area but also to a previous establishment at the same location that was called "The Buccaneer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevestonhotel.ca/|title=The Steveston - Buck &amp; Ear - Hotel - Liquor Store - Cafe|work=stevestonhotel.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bull and Mouth: Believed to celebrate the victory of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] at "[[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] Mouth" or Harbour. Also applies to Bull and Bush (Boulogne Bouche).
* Case is Altered: The title of [[The Case is Altered|an early comedy]] by [[Ben Jonson]], first published in 1609, based on a remark by lawyer Edmund Plowden which entered into common currency. Also said to be a corruption of the Latin phrase ''Casa Alta'' ('high house') or ''Casa Altera'' ('second house'). There are several examples in England, such as at [[Hatton, Warwickshire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/72/7265/Case_is_Altered/Five_Ways|title=Case is Altered|work=beerintheevening.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cat and Fiddle: a corruption of Caton le Fidèle (a governor of [[Calais]] loyal to [[King Edward III]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bartleby.com/81/13751.html | title = E.

[[File:Elephant and castle pub sign - geograph.org.uk - 655992.jpg|thumb|upright|Elephant and Castle pub sign near [[Bury St Edmunds]], interpreting the name as a [[howdah]]]]

* Elephant and Castle: By folk etymology, a corruption of "la [[Infanta de Castile]]". It is popularly believed amongst residents of [[Elephant and Castle]] that a 17th-century publican near [[Newington, London|Newington]] named his [[tavern]] after the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[princess]] who was affianced to King [[Charles I of England]]. The prohibition of this marriage by Church authorities in 1623 was a cause of war with Spain so it seems unlikely to have been a popular name. A more probable and prosaic explanation is that the name derives from the arms of the [[Worshipful Company of Cutlers]], a London trade guild; an elephant carrying a castle-shaped [[howdah]] can also be seen on the arms of the City of [[Coventry]].
* Fawcett Inn ("force it in"), [[Portsmouth]].
* Gate Hangs Well, common in the Midlands: "This Gate Hangs Well, and hinders none. Refresh and pay and travel on." Also frequently found as 'Hanging Gate'.
* Goat and Compass[es]: Possibly based on the arms of the [[Worshipful Company of Cordwainers]], whose coat of arms contains three goats, together with the [[Worshipful Company of Carpenters]], whose coat of arms contains three compasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chaplin |first1=Patrick |title=The Goat and Compasses |url=http://www.patrickchaplin.com/Whatsinapubsign.htm |website=Pub History |accessdate=9 September 2016 |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (either that, or from "God encompass us")&lt;ref name="Wedgwood" /&gt;
* Honest Lawyer [[Folkestone]], The Honest Politician, [[Portsmouth]].
* Hop Inn: similar to the Dew Drop Inn.  A double pun in that [[hops]] are a major ingredient in beer making.
* Jolly Taxpayer in [[Portsmouth]].
* Letters Inn ("let us in")
* Library: So students and others can say they're in 'the library',
* Nag's Head. Pub signs can play on the double meaning of Nag — a horse or a scolding woman.
* Nowhere, [[Plymouth]]; Nowhere Inn Particular, [[Croydon]]: Wife calls husband on his mobile and asks where he is. He answers truthfully "Nowhere".
* Office: as above.
* Ostrich, [[Ipswich]]: originally ''Oyster Reach'' (the old name has since been restored on the advice of historians).
* Paraffin Oil Shop (now closed, at the crossing of [[A5080]] and [[B5179]] in eastern [[Liverpool]], [https://www.google.com/maps/@53.4099299,-2.9170457,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s1k-k5U11NpKA3tPjlBAhrg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en Google Earth view here]: So people could say that they are going to buy [[kerosene|paraffin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.closedpubs.co.uk/lancashire/liverpool_l13_paraffinoilshop.html|title=Paraffin Oil Shop, Liverpool - another lost pub|website=www.closedpubs.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pig and Whistle: a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon saying ''piggin wassail'' meaning "good health".
* Swan With Two Necks: In the [[United Kingdom]], [[swan]]s have traditionally been the property of the reigning monarch. However, in the 16th century, [[Queen Elizabeth I]] granted the right to ownership of some swans to the [[Worshipful Company of Vintners]]. To tell which swan belonged to whom, it was decided that Vintners' swans' beaks should be marked with two notches, or nicks. The word 'nick' was mistaken for 'neck', and so the Vintners spotted that a Swan With Two Necks could afford them a rather clever pun, and a striking pub sign.
* Three Chimneys, [[Biddenden]]: During the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) it is said that up to 3,000 French prisoners were kept at nearby [[Sissinghurst Castle]]. The French seamen were placed on parole in the surrounding area and were allowed out as far as the pub building. At the time locals referred to this as the 'Three Wents' (or three ways) but the prisoners called it Les Trois Chemins. The unique name of the Three Chimneys therefore derives from the French term for the junction of three roads.

==Religious==
[[File:Lion and Lamb Court, Farnham. - geograph.org.uk - 136630.jpg|thumb|Lion and Lamb, [[Farnham]]]]

The amount of religious symbolism in pub names decreased after [[Henry VIII]]'s break from the church of Rome. For instance, many pubs now called the King's Head were originally called the Pope's Head.

* Anchor, Hope &amp; Anchor, Anchor &amp; Hope: From the [[Letter to the Hebrews]] (6:19): "We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope."
* Cross Keys: The sign of [[St Peter]], the gatekeeper of [[Heaven]]. Often found near a church dedicated to St Peter. When people walked to the Sunday service they often stayed afterwards, at a house near the church, to drink beer and to watch or participate in sporting events. These venues became known as pubs and would use the sign of the saint to which the church was dedicated - the Cross Keys for St Peter, an Eagle for [[John the Evangelist|St John]], a Lion for [[St Mark]]. The sporting events might include the racing or fighting of dogs, bulls, cocks or pheasants, or the hunting of foxes, with or without hounds - thus giving rise to further pub signs.
* Lamb &amp; Flag: From the [[Gospel of John]] (1:29): "Behold the [[Lamb of God]], which taketh away the sins of the world."  The Lamb is seen carrying a flag (usually of [[St. George]]) and is the symbol of the [[Knights Templar]], the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors]], and [[St John's College, Oxford]]. A pub of this name appeared in the popular BBC sitcom ''[[Bottom (TV series)|Bottom]]''.
* Five Ways: Possibly referring to the "Five Ways" of Thomas Aquinas, five reasons for the existence of God.
* Lion &amp; Lamb: The lion is a symbol of the [[Resurrection]], the lamb a symbol of the Redeemer.
* Mitre: [[Mitre|A bishop's headgear]], a simple sign easily recognisable by the illiterate. In [[Glastonbury]] and in [[Oxford]] a Mitre is adjacent to a church.
* Salutation: The greeting of the [[Archangel Gabriel]] to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] when informing her she was to carry [[Jesus Christ]].
* Shepherd &amp; Flock may refer to Christ (the Shepherd) and the people (his flock) but may also just mean the agricultural character and his charges.
* Three Crowns: The [[Magi]], but also see ''Heraldry'' above.
* Three Kings: The Magi.
* Parish: In [[Huddersfield]], Originally called "The Parish Pump", Referring to its close proximity to [[Huddersfield Parish Church]].

* [[Princess of Wales]]: following the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]], a number of pubs were renamed ''Princess of Wales'', including the ''Prince of Wales'' on Morden Road in [[South Wimbledon]]. The sign replaced with an image of a white rose; Diana was called "England's Rose" in a popular song at the time by [[Elton John]].

* Fountain Inn: Might refer to an actual fountain or natural spring.
* First In, Last Out: A pub on the edge of a town. It's the first pub on the way in and last on the way out. Does not refer to the habits of any of the pub's clientele as some signs suggest.
* Half Way House: This one is situated half-way between two places; but with the pub of this name at [[Camden Town]] it's anyone's guess which two places it's half-way between. A similar name is West End House (located at the West side of a town).

* Hangmans Inn, on site of [[gallows]] Guernsey
* Tunnel Top: near [[Runcorn]], Cheshire, named for its position over a canal tunnel.

Pubs with this name may no longer be situated near a standing mill, but there's a good chance they're close to a known site and will almost certainly be on a hill or other such breezy setting. Clues to the presence of a mill may also be found in the naming of local roads and features.

* Three Hills. A pub in the village of [[Bartlow]], [[Cambridgeshire]], named after three [[Tumulus|barrows]] close to the border with [[Essex]].

* Coach and Horses: A simple and common name found from [[Clerkenwell]] to [[Kew]], [[Soho]] to [[Portsmouth]].
* Four In Hand [[Four-in-hand|Method of reining horses]] so four may be controlled by a single coach driver.
* I am the Only Running Footman, [[Mayfair]], London W1; named after a servant employed by the wealthy to run ahead of their carriages and pay tolls.&lt;ref&gt;Unusual names of pubs&lt;/ref&gt;
* Perseverance: Name of a [[stage coach]]. The Perseverance in [[Bedford]] probably alludes to [[John Bunyan]]'s [[Pilgrim's Progress]], Bedford being Mr Bunyan's home town.
* Scotchman and his Pack, [[Bristol]]. Nothing to do with Scotland. The pub is situated at the bottom of the very steep St Michael's Hill. Vehicles going up the hill were prevented from rolling downwards by means of wooden wedges, called scotches, placed behind the wheels by a scotchman who carried the scotches in a pack.
*  Sedan Chair, [[Bristol]], which like the Two Chairmen, London, is named after the carriers of [[sedan chair]]s.
* Steamer, [[Welwyn]], Hertfordshire: It is found at the top of a steep hill where carriers required an extra horse (a cock-horse) to help get the wagon up the hill. After its exertion the cock-horse could be seen standing steaming on a cold day as its sweat evaporated.
* Terminus: Usually found where a [[tram]] route once terminated, sited near the tram terminus.
* Traveller's Rest, [[Northfield, Birmingham]]: a historic [[coaching inn]] on the main road to Bristol.
* Waggon and Horses: Another simple transport name (prior to American influence, the [[British English]] spelling of 'wagon' featured a double 'g',&lt;ref&gt;Bill Bryson, ''Mother Tongue'', Penguin Books p169&lt;/ref&gt; retained on pub signs such as this one).
* Wait for the Waggon, [[Bedford]] and [[Wyboston]], Bedfordshire: This is the name of the regimental march of The Royal Corps of Transport (now The Royal Logistic Corps), whose troops frequently use this route; the latter is sited on the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]].

===Water===
* Navigation: Usually situated alongside a [[canal]] towpath. Many pubs take their names from the company which once owned a nearby railway line, canal or navigation. For example:
* Grand Junction, for [[Grand Junction Canal|the canal]] in Bulbourne, [[Hertfordshire]]; [[High Holborn]] and [[Harlesden]], London.
* Grand Union, for [[Grand Union Canal|the canal]] in [[Westbourne, London|Westbourne Park]], [[Camden Town|Camden]] and [[Maida Vale]]
* Great Northern, for the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]], in [[Langley Mill]] and [[Thackley]]
* Great Western, for the [[Great Western Railway]], in [[Paddington]], [[Yeovil]] and [[Wolverhampton]]
* North Western: [[London and North Western Railway]] Company
* Shroppie Fly: [[Audlem]], named after a type of canalboat called a 'Shropshire Fly'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shroppiefly.co.uk/] The Shroppie Fly website&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trent Navigation: for the [[River Trent|Trent]] Navigation Company
* Fellows, Morton and Clayton: for the [[Fellows Morton and Clayton]] Canal Company
* Tide End Cottages: in [[Teddington]], at the end of the tidal reach of the [[River Thames]]
&lt;!--Please do not add anything here without a citation, we need more refs not more uncited text--&gt;

===Other===
*  Air Balloon, [[Birdlip]], [[Gloucestershire]]. Near a field where early ascents were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airballoon-pub-gloucestershire.co.uk/|title=Pubs in Birdlip - The Air Balloon - Old English Inns|work=airballoon-pub-gloucestershire.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Goat and Tricycle, [[Bournemouth]], [[Dorset]], a humorous modern name.
*  Rusty Bicycle, new name of the Eagle in [[Oxford]]. Oxford's students often cycle round the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkells.com/pubs_more2.php?id=609|title=The Rusty Bicycle, Oxford - Cowley pub/food/functions - Arkell's Brewery Swindon|work=arkells.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tram Depot, [[Cambridge]]: Occupies the building which once was the stables of Cambridge's [[tram]]way depot.
* Zeppelin Shelter, Aldgate, London, circa 1894, located opposite solid railway warehouses that were used in World War One (1914–1918) as East End civilian air raid shelters.

==Most common==

An authoritative list of the most common pub names in [[Great Britain]] is hard to establish, owing to ambiguity in what classifies as a [[pub]] as opposed to a licensed [[restaurant]] or [[nightclub]], and so lists of this form tend to vary hugely. The two surveys most often cited, both taken in 2007, are by the [[British Beer and Pub Association]] (BBPA) and [[Campaign for Real Ale|CAMRA]].

According to BBPA, the most common names are:&lt;ref name="common1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beerandpub.com/pub_facts.aspx|title=British Beer and Pub Association Fact Sheet, 2007 |publisher=BBPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Red Lion       (759)
#Royal Oak      (626)
#White Hart     (427)
#Rose and Crown (326)
#King's Head    (310)
#King's Arms    (284)
#Queen's Head   (278)
#The Crown      (261)

and according to [[Campaign for Real Ale|CAMRA]] they are:&lt;ref name="common2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solihullcamra.org.uk/features_archive.htm|title=Article at Solihull CAMRA site, 2007|publisher=CAMRA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301171337/http://www.solihullcamra.org.uk/features_archive.htm|archivedate=1 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Crown       (704)
#Red Lion    (668)
#Royal Oak   (541)
#Swan        (451)
#White Hart  (431)
#Railway     (420)
#Plough      (413)
#White Horse (379)
#Bell        (378)&lt;ref&gt;In 2008 it was claimed that the total number of names incorporating the word 'Bell' totalled 412.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horfieldringers.org/bell_anthology.htm#Pub|title=Horfield Ringers - Bell Anthology|work=horfieldringers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#New Inn     (372)

A more current listing can be found on the Pubs Galore site, updated daily as pubs open/close and change names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pubsgalore.co.uk/stats/pubs/pub-names/#Most|title=Common pub names on Pubs Galore|website=www.pubsgalore.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of January 30, 2018, the top 10 were:
#Red Lion    (567)
#Crown       (530)
#Royal Oak   (451)
#White Hart  (324)
#Swan        (309)
#Plough      (301)
#Railway     (299)
#White Horse (295)
#New         (257)
#Ship        (255)

The number of each is given in brackets.

==Curiosities==
The pubs with the shortest and longest names in Britain are both in [[Stalybridge]]: ''Q'' and ''The Old Thirteenth Cheshire Astley Volunteer Rifleman Corps Inn''. The longest name of a London pub, ''I am the Only Running Footman'', was used as the title of a [[mystery novel]] by [[Martha Grimes]].

There is a "pub with no name" in Southover Street, [[Brighton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Restaurant_Review-g186273-d3722852-Reviews-Pub_With_No_Name-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html|title=The Southover|work=tripadvisor.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Case is Altered]]'', an early comedy by [[Ben Jonson]], gives its name to several pubs.

The Salley Pussey's Inn at [[Royal Wootton Bassett]] is said to have been named after Sarah Purse, whose family owned The Wheatsheaf pub in the 19th century. In the 1970s the name was changed to the Salley Pussey's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marshman|first1=Mike&lt;!--County Local Studies Librarian--&gt;|title=Sarah Purse becomes Sally Pussey|url=http://www.wshc.eu/blog/item/sarah-purse-becomes-sally-pussey.html|publisher=Wiltshire &amp; Swindon History Centre|accessdate=9 September 2016|date=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage hypnosis''' is [[hypnosis]] performed in front of an audience for the purposes of entertainment, usually in a theatre or club. A modern stage hypnosis performance typically delivers a comedic show rather than simply a demonstration to impress an audience with powers of persuasion. Apparent effects of [[amnesia]], mood altering and [[hallucination]] may be demonstrated in a normal presentation. Stage hypnosis performances often encourage audience members to look further into the benefits of hypnotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lennis G. Echterling &amp; Jonathon Whalen |year=1995 |title=Stage hypnosis and public lecture effects on attitudes and beliefs regarding hypnosis |journal=[[American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis]] |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=13–21 |doi=10.1080/00029157.1995.10403173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes of behaviour exhibited by volunteers in stage hypnosis shows is an area of dispute. Some claim it illustrates altered states of consciousness (i.e., "hypnotic trance"). Others maintain that it can be explained by a combination of psychological factors observed in group settings such as disorientation, [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], [[peer pressure]], and ordinary [[suggestion]]. Others yet allege that deception plays a part.

==History==
Stage hypnosis evolved out of much older shows conducted by Mesmerists and other performers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Scottish surgeon [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] developed his technique of [[hypnosis]] after witnessing a stage performance by the travelling Swiss magnetic demonstrator [[Charles Lafontaine]] (1803–1892) in November 1841.&lt;ref&gt;"Magnetic demonstrator" – Gauld's term (Gauld, 1992, p. 204) – accurately describes Lafontaine; because whilst he was in the U.K., he only demonstrated "magnetic" phenomena; he never used it to treat anyone at any time (in public or private).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braid always maintained that he had gone to Lafontaine's demonstration as an open-minded sceptic, eager to examine the evidence and, then, form a considered opinion of Lafontaine's work. He was neither a closed-minded cynic intent on destroying Lafontaine, nor a deluded and naïvely credulous believer seeking authorisation of his already formed belief (''Neurypnology'' (1843), p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an extended account of the interactions between Braid and Lafontaine, see Yeates (2013), pp.103–308 passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

Braid was well aware of similar performances by "electro-biologists" in his day;&lt;ref&gt;"'''Electrobiology''': A mode of inducing hypnotism by having the subject look steadily at metallic disks. The process originated about the middle of the nineteenth century, and its fame was spread by numerous lecturers in England and the United States.", Melton, J.G. [2001] (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology (Fifth Edition), in Two Volumes, Volume 1 (A-L)'', Thomson Gale, (Farmington Hills), 2001, p.489.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., Braid published the contents of an advertising hand-bill for an "electro-biology" performance by a visiting American, George W. Stone,&lt;ref&gt;Stone was the compiler and editor of [https://archive.org/details/philosophyelect00stongoog ''The Philosophy of Electro-Biology, or Electrical Psychology, in a Course of Nine Lectures, Delivered by J. B. Dods, before the United States Senate, at Washington, in 1850, etc'']. Stone was also involved, for a time, in the active promotion the medium, Maria Basheba Hayden (1826–1883), the wife of his close friend, William Richardson Hayden, M.D. (1820–1903), journalist, and editor of ''The Boston Atlas'', and a monthly newsletter called ''The Star Spangled Banner''. Maria Hayden, who graduated M.D. in 1865, also [[Augustus De Morgan#Spiritualism|assisted Augustus De Morgan in his paranormal investigations]].&lt;/ref&gt; on 12 March 1851, which, as well as clearly emphasising that Stone was claiming to use volunteers from the audience, rather than his own stooges/assistants, details some of the phenomena that Stone's audience might have expected to have displayed to them.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Persons in a perfectly wakeful state, of well-known character and standing in society, who come forward voluntarily from among the audience, will be experimented upon. They will be deprived of the power of speech, hearing, sight. Their voluntary motions will be completely controlled, so that, they can neither rise up nor sit down, except at the will of the operator; their memory will be taken away, so that they will forget their own name and that of their most intimate friends; they will be made to stammer, and to feel pain in any part of their body at the option of the operator – a walking stick will be made to appear a snake, the taste of water will be changed to vinegar, honey, coffee, milk, brandy, wormwood, lemonade, etc., etc., etc. These extraordinary experiments are really and truly performed without the aid of trick, collusion, or deception, in the slightest possible degree.&lt;ref&gt;Braid's quote is at p.512 of [https://books.google.com/books?id=WjwCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA511#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Braid, J., "Electro-Biological Phenomena Physiologically and Psychologically Considered, by James Braid, M.R.C.S. Edinburgh, &amp;c. &amp;c. (Lecture delivered at the Royal Institution, Manchester, March 26, 1851)", ''The Monthly Journal of Medical Science'', Vol.12, (June 1851), pp.&amp;nbsp;511–530.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These are identical to many of the demonstrations which became central to subsequent "stage hypnosis", in fact it seems that little changes except the name and the introduction of the hypnotic induction, etc. Likewise, the novelist [[Mark Twain]] similarly recounts a Mesmeric performance which clearly resembles 20th century stage hypnosis, in his autobiography.

The absence of any reference to "hypnotism" in these early performances, indeed before the term was coined, and the fact that they often lacked anything resembling a modern hypnotic induction is consistent with the skeptical view, that stage hypnosis is primarily the result of ordinary suggestion rather than hypnotic trance. Indeed, early performers often claimed that they were influencing their subjects by means of telepathy and other supernatural powers.

Others, however, were delivering performances that displayed the wide range of hypnotic manifestations to their audiences. In the United States, for example, in the 1890s, there was a small group of highly skilled stage hypnotists, all whom were managed by Thomas F. Adkin, who toured country-wide, playing to packed houses. Adkin's group included Sylvain A. Lee,&lt;ref&gt;Author of ''The Practice of Hypnotic Suggestion'' (1901). One of his specialties was hypnotising per medium of the telephone; poster at [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?pp/PPALL:@field(NUMBER+@band(var+0467))] [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?pp/PPALL:@field(NUMBER+@band(var+2023))]&lt;/ref&gt;
Mr. and Mrs. Herbert L. Flint,&lt;ref&gt;Herbert L. Flint was the author of ''Flint's lessons in hypnotism; a comprehensive work on scientific suggestion as applied in hypnotism, mesmerism, personal magnetism, magnetic healing, psycho-therapeutics, suggestive therapeutics and similar manefestations of mental development and control'' (1915); poster at [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/var.1617]&lt;/ref&gt; and Professor Xenophon LaMotte Sage.&lt;ref&gt;Author of ''Hypnotism as It Is: a Book for Everybody'' (1897). Xenophon LaMotte Sage was the stage name of E. Virgil Neal; see Conroy, (2009), passim, especially pp.&amp;nbsp;27–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
Throughout the 20th century, despite adopting the term "hypnotism", stage hypnotists continued to explain their performances to audiences by reference to supernatural powers and [[animal magnetism]]. Ormond McGill, e.g., in his Encyclopedia of the subject wrote in 1996 that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some have called this powerful transmission of thought from one person to another "thought projection". The mental energy used appears to be of two types: magnetic energy&amp;nbsp;... generated within the body and telepathic energy generated within the mind.&amp;nbsp;... The two work together as a unit in applying Power Hypnosis. The operation of the two energies in combination is what Mesmer referred to as "animal magnetism".&lt;ref&gt;Ormond McGill, The New Encyclopedia of Stage Hypnosis, 1996: 24&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, this is not what Braid meant by "hypnotism", a term coined in opposition to theories of Mesmerism, to stress the fact that the results were due to ordinary psychological and physiological processes, such as suggestion and focused attention, rather than telepathy or animal magnetism. Indeed, after meeting with Mr. Stone, experimenting with his own subjects, and presenting his findings on such performances to the [[Royal Institution]], Braid concludes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is, therefore, both positive and negative proof in favour of my mental and suggestive theory, and in opposition to the magnetic, occult, or electric theories of the Mesmerists and electro-biologists. My theory, moreover, has this additional recommendation, that it is level to our comprehension, and adequate to account for all which is demonstrably true, without offering any violence to reason and common sense, or being at variance with generally admitted physiological and psychological principles.&lt;ref&gt;Braid, J. (1851). ''Electro-Biological Phenomena, etc.'', p.530.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, modern stage performers often continue to misuse the word "hypnosis" in describing their shows and encourage misconceptions about [[hypnotism]] by confusing it with [[Mesmerism]] for dramatic effect.{{Citation needed|reason=No evidence of current misconceptions|date=April 2013}}

==Skepticism==
[[File:Catalepsy example.png|thumb|right|[[Catalepsy]]: "the human bridge".]]
Mesmeric and other stage performances changed their names to "stage hypnotist" in the 19th century. They had originally claimed to produce the same effects by means of telepathy and animal magnetism, and only later began to explain their shows in terms of hypnotic trance and suggestion. Hence, many of the precursors of stage hypnosis did not employ hypnotic induction techniques. Moreover, several modern stage performers{{who|date=April 2013}} have themselves published criticisms which suggest that stage hypnosis is largely the result of sleight of hand, ordinary suggestion, and social compliance, etc., rather than hypnotic trance.{{Citation needed|reason=citation need for 'several' as well as 'modern'|date=April 2013}} Most notably, the well-known American magician and performer, [[Kreskin]], has frequently carried out typical stage hypnosis demonstrations without using any hypnotic induction. After working as a stage hypnotist and magician for nearly two decades, Kreskin became a skeptic and a whistleblower from within the stage hypnosis field.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For nineteen years I had believed in&amp;nbsp;... the sleeplike "hypnotic trance," practicing it constantly. Though I had nagging doubts at times, I wanted to believe in it. There was an overpowering mystique about putting someone to sleep, something that set me and all other "hypnotists" apart. We were marvellous Svengalis or Dr. Mesmers, engaged in a supernatural practice of sorts. Then it all collapsed. For me anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Kreskin, The Amazing World of Kreskin, 1973: 143.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After experimenting with his own subjects for several years until he was satisfied he could perform "stage hypnosis" without any hypnotic induction or trance, he concluded, "The battle of semantics may be waged for years, but I firmly believe that what is termed 'hypnosis' is, again, a completely normal, not abnormal, response to simple suggestion." An outspoken skeptic regarding stage hypnosis, Kreskin not only actively debunked stage hypnotists' claims, but went so far as to offer a substantial monetary reward, $25,000, to anyone who could prove the existence of hypnotic trance. The reward has been unsuccessfully challenged three times.&lt;ref&gt;Kreskin, The Amazing World of Kreskin, 1973: 152&lt;/ref&gt; While debunking the "sleep-trance" concept, Kreskin, like other skeptics adopting the nonstate position, was keen to emphasise that he felt the value of hypnotic suggestion had been frequently underestimated.

British stage hypnotist Alex Tsander has made a rejection of belief in a "state of hypnosis" a central feature of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Rider, D. 1995. "Playing Those Mind Games", Bath Chronicle, "Night Time" supplement, W/E March 8th&lt;/ref&gt; Tsander, who was among 39 parties consulted by the UK Home Office during their 1995-96 review of the regulation of performance,&lt;ref&gt;Dipple, D. 1996. UK Home Office circular No 39/1996 p. 2, para. 7&lt;/ref&gt; whilst continuing to perform, since 1993, also promoted a sceptical, social psychological view in a series of books. In "The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism" &lt;ref name="Tsander, A 2006"&gt;Tsander, A. 2006, 2012. The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism. Summitother. {{ISBN|0955073162}}&lt;/ref&gt; he stressed a terminological distinction between "hypnotism" and "hypnosis", stating that "hypnotism is the art of creating the illusion of hypnosis". Tsander calls his show "I Can't Believe It's NOT Hypnosis",&lt;ref&gt;Royle, J. 2005. Confessions of A Hypnotist: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Hypnosis But Were Afraid To Ask. Xlibris Corporation. P450.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} a title since adopted by others. Tsander boldly states in publicity that no participant is ever in a "state of hypnosis". He argues, in "Beyond Hypnosis",&lt;ref&gt;Tsander, A. 2005. Beyond Hypnosis: Hypnotism, Stage Hypnotism and The Myth of "Hypnosis", Summitother, {{ISBN|0955073189}}&lt;/ref&gt; that all activities that use hypnotic protocols, such as in hypnotherapy, are based in the cultural influence of roles and schemas of what it is to be hypnotised, ultimately created and sustained through the impressions made by stage hypnotists, manipulating social psychological factors. As an extreme illustration of this, Tsander has used the example of Milton Erickson. Whilst Erickson objected to stage hypnotism, Tsander argued, in "Beyond Erickson" &lt;ref&gt;Tsander, A. 2005. Beyond Erickson: A Fresh Look at "The Emperor of Hypnosis", Summitother. {{ISBN|0955073103}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the therapists reputation largely depended upon live demonstrations and that he was in effect a stage hypnotist. He takes Erickson's own accounts of his demonstrations and explains them in terms of normal, social psychological processes and interactions, requiring no special phenomenon or hypnosis to explain.

==Role of deception==

Due to stage hypnotists' showmanship, many people believe that hypnosis is a form of mind control. However, the effects of stage hypnosis are probably due to a combination of relatively ordinary social psychological factors such as peer pressure, social compliance, participant selection, ordinary suggestibility, and some amount of physical manipulation, stagecraft, and trickery.&lt;ref name="Yapko 1990 28"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Yapko | first = Michael |authorlink=Michael D. Yapko | title=Trancework: An introduction to the practice of Clinical Hypnosis | location=New York, New York | publisher=Brunner/Mazel | year=1990 | pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to be the centre of attention, having an excuse to violate their own inner fear suppressors and the pressure to please are thought to convince subjects to "play along".&lt;ref name="Wagstaff"&gt;Wagstaff, Graham F. (1981) ''Hypnosis, Compliance and Belief'', St. Martin's Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-312-40157-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Books written by stage hypnotists sometimes explicitly describe the use of [[deception]] in their acts. For example, [[Ormond McGill|Ormond McGill's]] ''New Encyclopedia of Stage Hypnosis'' describes an entire "fake hypnosis" act which depends upon the use of private whispers throughout:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[The hypnotist whispers off-microphone:] "We are going to have some good laughs on the audience and fool them&amp;nbsp;... so when I tell you to do some funny things, do exactly as I secretly tell you. Okay? Swell." (Then deliberately wink at the spectator in a friendly fashion.)&lt;ref&gt;McGill, Ormond. (1996) ''The New Encyclopedia of Stage Hypnosis'', p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to experts such as [[Theodore X. Barber]] and [[André Muller Weitzenhoffer]], stage hypnosis traditionally employs three fundamental strategies:
# '''Participant compliance'''. Participants on stage tend to be compliant because of the social pressure felt in the situation constructed on stage, before an expectant audience.
# '''Participant selection'''. Preliminary suggestion tests, such as asking the audience to clasp their hands and suggesting they cannot be separated, are usually used to select out the most suggestible and [[compliance (psychology)|socially compliant]] subjects from the audience. By asking for volunteers to mount the stage, the performer also tends to select the most [[extraverted]] members of the audience.
# '''Deception of the audience'''. Stage hypnotists are performers who traditionally, but not always, employ a variety of "sleight of hand" strategies to mislead their audience for dramatic effect.

The strategies of deception employed in traditional stage hypnosis can be categorised as follows:
# '''Off-microphone whispers'''. The hypnotist lowers his microphone and whispers secret instructions to the participant on stage, outside the audience's hearing. These may involve requests to "play along" or fake hypnotic responses.&lt;ref name=BSC&gt;Barber, Spanos &amp; Chaves. ''Hypnotism: Imagination &amp; Human Potentialities'' (1974), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Failure to challenge'''. The stage hypnotist pretends to challenge subjects to defy a suggestion, for example, "You cannot stand up out of your chair because your backside is stuck down with glue." However, no specific cue is given to the participants to begin their effort ("Start trying now!"). This creates the illusion that a specific challenge has been issued and effort made to defy it.&lt;ref name=BSC /&gt;
# '''Fake hypnosis tricks'''. Stage hypnosis literature contains a large repertoire of sleight of hand tricks, of the kind used by professional illusionists. None of these tricks require any hypnosis or suggestion, but depend purely on physical manipulation and audience deception. The most famous example of this type is the "human plank" trick, which involves making a subject's body become rigid (cataleptic) and suspending them horizontally between two chairs, at which point the hypnotist will often stand upon their chest for dramatic effect. This has nothing to do with hypnosis, but simply depends on the fact that when subjects are positioned in the correct way they can support more weight than the audience tends to assume.&lt;ref name=BSC /&gt;
# '''Stooges'''. Several experts, including Kreskin, have stated that stage hypnotists have been known to make use of stooges (also called ''horses'') who travel from show to show. A stage hypnotist may only require a single stooge because by using him first for each demonstration real subjects from the audience will tend to follow his lead and imitate his responses. Moreover, for the climax of the show, the hypnotist will often focus on one or two subjects to demonstrate more difficult and dramatic responses involving apparent hallucinatory experiences. A single stooge can be used for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Kreskin. ''The Amazing World of Kreskin'' (1973), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weitzenhoffer400&gt;[[André Muller Weitzenhoffer|Weitznehoffer, Andre]]. ''The Practice of Hypnotism'' (2000), p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weitzenhoffer writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Having not only had a chance to watch famous stage hypnotists of the 1940s and 50s such as [Ralph] Slater&lt;ref&gt;Real name Joseph Bolsky (see [https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.198933960176777.46878.184120231658150&amp;type=3] ("Dr. Wilbur" is [[Cornelia B. Wilbur]]), and [http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/192/308/210802]).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Franz Polgar|Polgar]] at work but having also had a chance to have fairly extensive personal contact with other stage hypnotists, I believe I can throw some light upon the situation. To begin with, one should be aware that many stage hypnotists use stooges or plants.&lt;ref name=Weitzenhoffer400 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Alex Tsander argues&lt;ref&gt;Tsander, A. 2006,2012. The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism, Summitother. {{ISBN|0955073162}}&lt;/ref&gt; that use of a stooge has in modern times been for all practical purposes inconceivable because of the frequency of their reappearance in different performances (sometimes repeatedly at the same venue) and the dire consequences of being discovered. A likelihood increased by the Internet, social media and camera-phones in the audience.

Whilst denying the existence of a "state of hypnosis", Tsander has since the early 1990s presented "close up" sessions in which volunteers sit with him at a table whilst the audience sit or stand adjacent. An audience in close proximity makes the kind of subterfuge mentioned above, such as stage whispers, impossible. For Tsander, coupled with his denying a state of hypnosis, this demonstrates that social psychology and suggestion offer sufficient explanation for all hypnotic effects. Under favourable circumstances neither "hypnosis" nor deception is necessary to obtain even the most theatrical behaviour from suitable volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Tsander, A. Visual Reference, 1.Accessed online at: https://www.flickr.com/photos/16196214@N07/1753544748/in/album-721576027209907589/&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, those who argue for a substantial "state" of hypnosis cite clinical claims (not actually evidenced in any case of stage performance, one hopes) such as the following:

"...editorial implying most subjects have no will or interest in not following the suggestion of the hypnotist, conveniently omit the primary interest in hypnotism came in the early 1800's before ether and morphine were widely available. Thousands of extremely painful operations were performed through the use of hypnosis. Patients awoke without memory of the surgery and even healed much faster than those who endured the extreme pain without hypnosis. Sigmund Freud was directly responsible for removing hypnosis from psychotherapy because of so many reports that patients also had intuitions about conditions of patients they had never met while in the trance state."&lt;ref&gt;Anon. 2016. Edit to this Wiki as quoted.{{reliable source|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such arguments originate in the work of James Esdaile at a medical mission in India, recounted in his book of 1847. This was before the concept of "hypnotism" (only recently promoted by Braidin 1843) had spread and Esdailes work was still referred to as "Mesmerism". Whilst Esdaile claimed his patients felt no pain observers on behalf of an independent commission of enquiry for the Bengal government reported scenes of those undergoing such operations writhing in agony. Regarding more recent claims of painless surgery, Barber, among others, has pointed out that detail in accounts of such surgery admit that patients are, even though not unconscious, rendered stuporous by cocktails of anxiolytics. Moreover, the proportion of patients capable of undergoing such procedures (attaining sufficiently "deep" "hypnosis") is as small as the percentage of the population who are capable of undergoing surgery with neither chemical nor hypnotic assistance, inviting the suspicion that these groups of "special" patients overlap. Moreover, Barber also points out that invariably, cases of hypnotic surgery do use local anaesthetic at the area of incision, whilst internal organs are not capable of registering pain in response to a skilled cut rendering many such operations feasible without general anaesthetic, the role of hypnotic influence being essentially at an emotional or anxiolytic level. Furthermore, far from there being "thousands" of such cases of hypno-anaesthesia in surgery it remains sufficiently rare as to warrant the attention of news reports when it occurs. As rare, indeed, as the exceptional individuals able to undergo such surgery.

However, none of the foregoing debate about hypnotic procedures in a clinical setting has any bearing upon stage hypnosis.

==Role of hypnotist and subject==

=== Hypnotist ===
[[File:Nazareth College Hypnotist.jpg|thumb|right|A stage hypnotist and his subjects]]

Due to stage hypnotists' showmanship and their perpetuating the [[illusion]] of possessing mysterious abilities, the appearance of a trance state is often interpreted as an "effect" of the hypnotist's "power". The real power of stage hypnosis comes from the trust the "hypnotist" can instill in their subjects. Subjects have to cooperate and be willing to follow instructions and the hypnotist will employ several tests to choose the best subjects. Some people are very trusting, or even looking for an excuse to abdicate their responsibilities and are apparently able to be "hypnotised" within seconds, while others take more time to counter their fears.

Suggestion is very powerful and a good hypnotist will know how to deliver suggestions that can create better entertainment for the audience. In his book ''Deeper and Deeper'' by Jonathan Chase,&lt;ref&gt;Chase, Jonathan (2005) ''Deeper and Deeper'' the secrets of stage hypnosis - p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; he talks about delivering suggestion, more importantly, The Super Suggestion a phrase he coined in his first published book in 1999:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"From this moment everything I say to you. Every single thing I say, no matter how silly or stupid it seems will instantly become your reality. Everything I say will instantly become your reality."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He emphasises the use of repetition but warns that when they have accepted the suggestion then everything that the hypnotist says to them after this point will become an irresistible suggestion.

Historically, stage hypnotists often made claims for hypnotically induced enhancements to volunteer abilities beyond normal limits. One such routine that persists is that of "The Human Bridge". The English hypnotist Alex Tsander has made a particular theme of taking this cliché routine, which is still touted by many hypnotists as a uniquely hypnotic "feat", and de-bunking it by demonstrating that no hypnosis is required. He does this in studio videos with non-hypnotised volunteers, both models and himself, talking to camera. Whilst emphasising that no weight should ever be placed on a person in that situation (which is specifically forbidden in public UK performances under the Model Conditions) he explains in "The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism" &lt;ref&gt;Tsander, A. 2005, 2012. The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism. Summitother. {{ISBN|0955073162}}&lt;/ref&gt; how performers elsewhere deceive audiences when doing so. At the Kit Kat club, Berlin, in 2012, whilst appearing as himself, Tsander also performed as "Erektor The Bridgebuilder" presenting "Bridgeward Bound",&lt;ref&gt;Residentadvisor. 2012. Wasteland Berlin. Accessed online at: https://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?395975&lt;/ref&gt; an erotic bondage version of the Human Bridge with a female co-performer, that dramatically fore-grounded the fact that the "feat" requires no hypnosis, which was neither induced nor pretended.

===Subjects===
In a stage hypnosis situation the "hypnotist" chooses their participants carefully. First they give the entire audience a few exercises to perform and plant ideas in their minds, such as:
*only intelligent people can be hypnotised
*only those who are open-minded to being hypnotised and willing to participate.

It has been alleged that these suggestions are designed to overcome the natural fear of trusting a stranger with the greater fear of becoming an object of ridicule as one who is unintelligent, unsociable, and joyless. However, whilst a self-proclaimed "sceptic", British stage hypnotist Alex Tsander argues that a more important reason for such admonitions is to filter out "pseudo-volunteers": those who only offer to participate in order to prove that they are as they see it "too intelligent" to respond, or who want to show that they can resist becoming hypnotised, with no intention to genuinely cooperate in achieving a positive result. Tsander advises that a hypnotist should state clearly at the outset that "anyone can resist being hypnotised, so to do so will prove nothing."&lt;ref name="Tsander, A 2006"/&gt;

Out of the crowd the hypnotist will spot people who appear trusting, extroverted and willing to put on a show. The hypnotist starts them off by having them imagine ordinary situations that they have likely encountered, like being cold or hot, hungry or thirsty then gradually builds to giving them a suggestion to do something that is totally out of character, such as tap dancing, singing like [[Elvis]] or clucking like a [[chicken]].

The desire to be the centre of attention, having an excuse to violate their own inner fear suppressors and the pressure to please, plus the expectation of the audience wanting them to provide some entertainment is usually enough to persuade an extrovert to do almost anything. In other words, the participants are persuaded to 'play along'. Yet, whilst this accounts for some situations, it does not accord with those where hecklers, uncooperative audiences and those who wish to "disprove" the hypnotist create a set of negative expectations, uncooperative atmosphere and opposition which the performer must use skill to overcome.

== Law ==
In some countries, there are laws and guidelines regarding stage hypnosis.

In the UK, the Hypnotism Act 1952 governs the use of hypnosis in public. The original Act was amended in 1976 and again in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/changes/affected/ukpga/1952/46&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 the government released "model conditions" which were refined and revised after consultation with FESH and with medical and academic psychologists. Note that these have no legal force: they are suggested conditions which local authorities may or may not feel appropriate to impose or modify when regulating hypnosis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fesh.co.uk/Law.htm&lt;/ref&gt; If stage hypnosis is performed at a public venue a permit (permission) must be acquired from the local authority and the local authority is advised to monitor the performance to ensure that all guidelines are followed. It is illegal to hold any form of stage hypnosis in a public venue (amongst other venues) unless the local authority has issued their consent for this.

In the accompanying circular announcing the revised model conditions in 1996&lt;ref&gt;Dipple, D. 1996. UK Home Office circular No39/1996&lt;/ref&gt; it was conceded that, as asserted by skeptical stage hypnotist Alex Tsander during the consultation process:

''"In practice volunteers do not react as if they truly believe that there is, for example, a giant spider behind them or a bomb under their chair."''&lt;ref&gt;Dipple, 1996, p6, sub-section "Previous Section 3(I)(Vi).&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a critical point of distinction and represents a formal recognition of the "as if" nature of behaviour in stage hypnotism in contradistinction to claims for its supposed subjective reality.

In the past, stage hypnosis has been banned in several countries in the world including Denmark and some states in the USA. Most of these countries have revoked these laws or don't enforce them.{{cn|date=June 2018}} In Israel, it remains illegal to perform any kind of hypnosis without a license given to doctors, dentists and psychologists.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

'''Supercell Oy''' is a Finnish [[mobile game]] development company based in [[Helsinki]]. Founded in May 2010, the company's debut game was the browser game ''Gunshine.net'', and after its release in 2011, Supercell started developing games for mobile devices. Since then, the company has fully released four mobile games: ''[[Hay Day]]'', ''[[Clash of Clans]]'', ''[[Boom Beach]]'', and ''[[Clash Royale]]'', which are [[freemium]] games and have been very successful for the company, the first two generating revenue of $2.4 million a day in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2013/04/18/the-2-4-million-per-day-company-supercell/|title=The $2.4 Million-Per-Day Company: Supercell|first=Karsten|last=Strauss|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Accel Partners]] and [[Index Ventures]] invested $12 million in the Series A of Supercell in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110525006242/en/Supercell-Raises-12M-Accel-Partners|title=Supercell Raises $12M from Accel Partners|publisher=[[Business Wire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atomico]] led the Series B investment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/supercell-series-b--5df30452#section-lead-investors|title=Series B - Supercell - 2013-04-18 {{!}} Crunchbase|website=Crunchbase|language=en|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and in October 2013 it was announced that the Japanese company [[GungHo Online Entertainment]] and its parent [[SoftBank Corp.|SoftBank]] had acquired 51% of the company for a reported $1.51 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/15/supercell-funding-softbank-gungho-clash-of-clans/ Clash of Clans maker Supercell raises $1.5bn to become the next Nintendo] 15 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 2015, SoftBank acquired an additional 22.7% stake in Supercell, which brought their total stake to 73.2% of the company and made them the sole external shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/01/softbank-buys-another-23-of-supercell-shares-now-owns-73-of-the-mobile-gaming-giant/|title=SoftBank Ups Its Stake In Supercell To 73% As Sole External Shareholder|first=Ingrid|last=Lunden|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Supercell reported annual revenues of around €2.11 billion.&lt;ref name="kl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kauppalehti.fi/uutiset/supercellilta-hurjat-luvut-liikevaihto-harppasi-2-1-miljardiin--tyontekijat-saivat-osansa/n8swg4E6 |title=Supercelliltä hurjat luvut: liikevaihto harppasi 2,1 miljardiin |last1=Pietarila |first1=Päivikki |date=9 March 2016 |website=[[Kauppalehti]] |language=Finnish |access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In three years, the company's revenues have grown a total of 800 percent, from 78.4 million (2012).&lt;ref name="kl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kl2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kauppalehti.fi/uutiset/supercell-meni-kirkkaasti-yli-miljardirajan/mhUMDxL9 |title=Supercell meni kirkkaasti yli miljardirajan |last1=Pietarila |first1=Päivikki |date=24 March 2015 |website=[[Kauppalehti]] |language=Finnish |access-date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finder.fi/Tietokonepelej%C3%A4+ja+pelikonsoleita/Supercell+Oy/HELSINKI/taloustiedot/2330069 |title=Supercell Oy – Taloustiedot |date= |website=Fonecta Finder |language=Finnish |access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2016, [[Tencent]] acquired 84.3% of Supercell with USD 8.6 billion. Japan's SoftBank values Supercell at $10.2 billion.&lt;ref name="Osawa"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-agrees-to-acquire-clash-of-clans-maker-supercell-1466493612|title=Tencent Seals Deal to Buy ‘Clash of Clans’ Developer Supercell for $8.6 Billion|last=Osawa|first=Juro|date=21 June 2016|last2=Needleman|first2=Sarah E.|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company==
Supercell is part of the Japanese telecommunications company [[SoftBank]], which owned 73.2% of the company. Ilkka Paananen owns 6% and Mikko Kodisoja 5.4% of the shares. Originally, SoftBank bought 51% of the company together with the game company [[GungHo]] for 1.1 billion euros in 2013. In the sale, all Supercell's employees sold the same amount of their shares. One condition for the sale was that the main office would stay in Finland. SoftBank and GungHo founded the Kahon 3 Inc in Finland. The company's articles of incorporation state that the company will remain Finnish. Kahon bought Supercell, and later GungHo sold its shares to SoftBank. In May 2015, SoftBank finally bought the rest of the investors out of the company and increased its shares to 73.2%. At that time the technology magazine [[VentureBeat]] estimated the value of Supercell to be 4.9 billion euros. In March 2016, SoftBank owned over 75% of Supercell's shares. On 21 June 2016 [[Tencent]] announced a deal to acquire 84.3% of Supercell with USD 8.6 billion.&lt;ref name="Osawa"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-agrees-to-acquire-clash-of-clans-maker-supercell-1466493612|title=Tencent Seals Deal to Buy ‘Clash of Clans’ Developer Supercell for $8.6 Billion|last=Osawa|first=Juro|date=21 June 2016|last2=Needleman|first2=Sarah E.|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supercell's main office is located in the former facilities of the [[Nokia]] research center in Helsinki's [[Ruoholahti]] district.

The company has offices also in Tokyo, Beijing, San Francisco, and Seoul.

===Business model===
Supercell focuses on the development of free-to-play games that yield profits through the in-game micropayments. The company's objective is to focus on the successful games that stay popular for years. The focus has not been on revenue, but on the principle "just design something great, something that users love."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2013/04/17/is-this-the-fastest-growing-game-company-ever/|title=Is This the Fastest-Growing Game Company Ever?|last=Strauss|first=Karsten|date=6 May 2013|work=Forbes|department=Technology|pages=50, 52|type=Paper|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game development focuses around "cells" of five to seven people which start with idea generation and an initial review by CEO Paananen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The team subsequently develops the idea into a game, which the rest of the company's employees get to play-test, followed by play-testing in Canada's [[iTunes]] App store; if the Canada reception is good, the next step is global rollout (via iTunes).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Supercell has discontinued a total of 14 game projects it did not deem promising enough,{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} successful failures which are celebrated by employees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One of the games that was cancelled well into development was ''Battle Buddies'', which had also been rated well in the test market, but the number of players was still too small. The final decision for cancelling a project is done by the development team themselves.

===Charity===
The employees of Supercell donated 3.4 million euros to the Finnish New Children's Hospital project. It is presumably the largest charity donation done by company employees in the history of Finland. Supercell has also given donations to the American charity organisation [[Watsi]].

The company founders Mikko Kodisoja and Ilkka Paananen have founded the ME foundation that supports different kinds of charity projects. In November 2015, the ME foundation donated 2.5 million euros to the Helsinki youth department for the support of young immigrants. Supercell also organised a fundraising that collected old computers and tablets from game companies to donate to poor families with children through the Finnish Tukikummit Foundation, a registered non-profit organisation. Supercell was also the biggest individual investor in the [[crowdfunding]] campaign for the [[Finnish Museum of Games|Finnish Game Museum]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://suomenpelimuseo.fi/category/ajankohtaista/page/3/ | title=ajankohtaista – Sivu 3 | publisher=Suomen Pelimuseo | date=August 20, 2015 | accessdate=December 4, 2016|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Background and founding===
Before founding Supercell, two of the founders Mikko Kodisoja and Ilkka Paananen worked at the mobile game company Sumea. Kodisoja was one of the founders of Sumea in 1999, and Paananen was hired as the company's CEO in 2000. In 2003, Sumea gained 1.2 million euros of profit. In the following year, the American [[Digital Chocolate]] bought Sumea and made the company its Finnish headquarters and Paananen the European manager. With the new owner, the business activity increased, but at the same time the business culture took a more problematic direction according to Kodisoja, who was the creative director at the time. He left the company in 2010, and soon after Paananen did so as well.&lt;ref&gt;Lappalainen, p. 167−168&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, Paananen worked at the financier company Lifeline Ventures, but soon wanted to become an entrepreneur himself. He planned to found a game company where executives would not disturb the work of the game developers. Together, Paananen, Kodisoja, Petri Styrman, Lassi Leppinen, Visa Forstén, and Niko Derome who had known each other through work connections, founded Supercell in 2010. The company started its business in a cramped office in the [[Niittykumpu]] district of [[Espoo]].&lt;ref name="lappalainen20152"&gt;Lappalainen, p. 169−171&lt;/ref&gt;

Kodisoja and Paananen invested 250,000 euros from their savings from their time at Sumea in the company. In addition, the Finnish funding agency for technology innovation [[Tekes (agency)|Tekes]] gave them a loan of 400,000 euros. Lifeline Ventures also became an investor. In the following October, Supercell raised 750,000 euros through seed funding from for example London Venture Partners and Initial Capital. The first game Supercell started to develop was the massive multiplayer online game ''Gunshine'' that could be played on [[Facebook]] with a browser or on mobile platforms, and the game's prototype was ready in eight months.&lt;ref name="lappalainen20152"/&gt; After ''Gunshine's'' completion, [[Accel Partners]] also invested 8 million euros in the company in May 2011, and shareholder Kevin Comolli became a member of Supercell's board of directors. Accel has also invested in [[Rovio Entertainment|Rovio]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Lappalainen, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change of strategies===
In November 2011, Supercell abandoned ''Gunshine'' for three reasons: it did not interest players for long enough, it was too difficult to play, and the mobile version did not work as well as the browser version. At best, the game had approximately half a million players. Supercell noticed the company could not catch up to the current leader of Facebook games, the [[Zynga]] company, and decided to focus on [[iPad]] games. Another Facebook game on development was left unfinished as well. The change of direction did not drive away the investors, but the pressure to succeed became worse, and Paananen had to make more detailed reports of progress for the investors.&lt;ref name="lappalainen20152"/&gt;

The company simultaneously developed five games, and the first one to be released for test market was ''Pets vs Orcs''. This game, as well as another concept, ''Tower'', were abandoned. In May 2012, ''[[Hay Day]]'' was published and eventually became Supercell's first internationally released game.&lt;ref name="lappalainen20152"/&gt; ''Hay Day'' was Supercell's version of Zynga's successful Facebook game ''[[FarmVille]]'', an easy-to-play farm simulator. Supercell added to their farming simulator the ability to refine products, a production chain, and touch screen properties. The social aspect of the game was emphasised as well. In four months, the game became one of the most profitable games in Apple's App Store in the US, and was one of the most profitable in the world for two and a half years. The game receives regular updates and is maintained by a team of 14 people.&lt;ref&gt;Lappalainen, p. 176−182&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of ''Clash of Clans''===
Lasse Louhento had started at [[Bloodhouse]], and Lassi Leppinen was the chief programmer at Sumea and Digital Chocolate. Their team had spent months on a fantasy themed Facebook game when Supercell changed strategies. Leppinen and Louhento wanted to make a strategy game that would use a touch screen so playing would be as simple and pleasant as possible. The development of ''[[Clash of Clans]]'' took six months, and the game was released on August 2, 2012. In three months, it became the most profitable app in the US. According to App Annie, in the years 2013 and 2014 ''Clash of Clans'' was the most profitable mobile game in the world. The eponymous battle between the clans was added to the game as late as in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Lappalainen, p. 183−187&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2013, Supercell started marketing collaboration with the Japanese GungHo: the companies cross-marketed each other's games in their own games in their own markets. As a result, ''Clash of Clans'' became one of the most downloaded apps in Japan. GungHo's chairman of the board [[Taizo Son]] flew to Finland to thank Paananen and later introduced him to his brother [[Masayoshi Son]], the CEO of the SoftBank Corporation. Soon, they proposed a corporate acquisition which indeed happened on October 7th 2013. SoftBank and GungHo bought 51% of Supercell's shares for 1.1 billion euros which is the largest price for a Finnish private company in history. In six months, Supercell's value had tripled, since in spring 2013 the company had sold 16.7% of its shares for 100 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;Lappalainen, p. 209−210&lt;/ref&gt;

Both ''Clash of Clans'' and ''Hay Day'' were released in the summer 2012,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and Supercell did not release a new game in almost two years. The designing of the third game ''[[Boom Beach]]'' started in the autumn of 2012, and it was released in 2014. The new strategy game was released to the test market at the end of 2013, after which it went through large changes. The game was very successful in the US right after its release in March, but it did not stay at the top of the download charts for very long. However, it rose to the top 30 of the most downloaded [[iPhone]] apps after Supercell started an expensive marketing campaign in December 2014. In 2015, the game surpassed ''Hay Day'' in the charts.&lt;ref&gt;Lappalainen, p. 195−199&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Supercell released its fourth supported game, ''[[Clash Royale]]'', which uses similar characters from ''Clash of Clans''. Between the releases of ''Boom Beach'' and ''Clash Royale'', Supercell had discontinued nine game projects, two in their test release phase. One of them was ''Smash Land'' which had been developed by 4 to 5 people for 10 months.&lt;ref&gt;Graft, Kris (March 16, 2016).

'''TV 100''' is the first non-state TV station in [[Greece]]. It belongs to the Municipality of Thessaloniki, founded in 1988 by the then mayor of the city [[Sotiris Kouvelas]], who served as mayor until 1989 and a year later, he founded TV station with national coverage in [[Athens]], the '''New Channel''' and later [[Tempo TV]]. These two channels have worked together for some time exchanging programs and news bulletins.

Simultaneously with the launch of the TV 100, the [[Municipality of Thessaloniki]], aired for the first time in [[northern Greece]] several foreign satellite channels to alternative in the way we watched public television at the time, activity later followed the state broadcasting organization across the country.

This cooperation started in 2002 and lasted until the end of 2012 until both stations ended their cooperation. At the same time, the FM 100 started cooperation with [[Athens 9.84]] and ''Max FM 97.3'' was sold a year later, namely, at the end of March 2014 in the ownership of ''Folk FM 87.6'' Thessaloniki and renamed ''Pop FM 97.3''.

'''Television in Colombia''' or  [[Colombia]]n [[television]] ({{lang-es|Televisión de Colombia}}) is a [[media of Colombia]]. It is characterized for broadcasting [[telenovela]]s, [[Television program|series]], [[game show]]s and [[News broadcasting|TV news]]. Until 1998 it was a state monopoly (though there was a short-lived local private channel from 1966 to 1971, known as Teletigre). There are two privately owned TV networks and three state-owned TV networks with national coverage, as well as six regional TV networks and dozens of local TV stations. There are numerous [[cable TV]] companies operating in Colombia under each [[Departments of Colombia|Colombian department]] statutes. These cable companies also develop their own channels, in addition to a variety of international channels. Television in Colombia has always relied on technological advancements from developed countries importing almost all the equipment.

Television in Colombia was inaugurated on 13 June 1954 during the government of General [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]], who became impressed with the new invention during a visit to [[Nazi Germany]] as a [[military attaché]]. Rojas imported [[Siemens]] and [[DuMont Laboratories|DuMont]] equipment&lt;ref name="odisea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semana.com/noticias-especiales/arranco-odisea/79427.aspx|title=Así arrancó la odisea|date=2004-06-06|publisher=''[[Revista Semana|Semana]]''|language=Spanish|accessdate=2009-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hired [[Cuba]]n technicians  to set up a [[Canal Uno|TV station]] in time for the commemoration of Rojas's first year in office. A test broadcast was made 1 May 1954 covering [[Bogotá]] and [[Manizales]].&lt;ref name="odisea" /&gt;

Initially television in Colombia was public, with emphasis on education and cultural topics until, in 1955, the government developed a system of concessions, in which the State was in charge of the television infrastructure and gave programming slots in the channels to private companies known as ''programadoras''. These companies bid for timeslots on the national channel to show their programs. The first of these companies to be founded was [[Producciones PUNCH]], followed quickly by [[RTI Colombia]]. In 1963 [[Inravisión]], the [[public broadcasting|public broadcaster]], was created. Before that, it was operated by the [[Televisora Nacional de Colombia|Televisora Nacional]], part of the [[Radiodifusora Nacional de Colombia]]. In 1966 the government then tried to privatize the sector, opening bidding for a private license in Bogotá. Caracol, RTI and Punch would bid on the license, but the winner was Consuelo Salgar de Montejo and her [[Teletigre]]. Teletigre was a huge success.  Mrs.  Montejo made  an alliance with ABC and brought many of the US shows translated into Spanish to the local viewers.  Her programming was so good,  that it eclipsed the  government owned channel by taking most of the audience.  This created envy among many local business men whom felt threatened by  an emerging business woman,  in a totalitarian male chauvinistic society. The government recognized the power of the media and therefore did not renew  the broadcast license for Teletigre. Teletigre would return to state hands and become [[Tele 9 Corazón]] and, in 1972 [[Segunda Cadena]], with national coverage. Mrs.  Montejo attempted on many occasions to get back in broadcasting TV,  but the government controlled monopoly would never give her a slot.  

On 11 December 1979, regular [[color television]] broadcasts started in Colombia&lt;ref&gt;[[Luís Ángel Arango Library]], [http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/exhibiciones/historia_tv/1979.htm La televisión a Color para todos 1979] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216142651/http://lablaa.org/blaavirtual/exhibiciones/historia_tv/1979.htm |date=2009-02-16 }}, ''Historia de la televisión en Colombia'', accessed 24 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[NTSC]] standard. Colour television had already been introduced in October 1973, when ''programadora'' [[Cenpro Televisión]] made a colour broadcast during an education seminar with [[Japan]]ese-made equipment. The inauguration and the first match of the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] were broadcast live in colour, but they could be seen in colour only on big screens in Bogotá and Cali.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luís Ángel Arango Library]], [http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/exhibiciones/historia_tv/1974.htm Las primeras imágenes a color 1974] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201162742/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/exhibiciones/historia_tv/1974.htm |date=2008-12-01 }}, ''Historia de la televisión en Colombia'', accessed 24 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s and 1980s, the Colombian national television system had three national networks: [[Canal Uno|Cadena Uno]], [[Canal A|Cadena Dos]] and [[Señal Colombia|Cadena Tres]]. The first two worked under the concessions system while the Cadena Tres (later renamed to [[Señal Colombia]]) remained under complete government control and focused on cultural and educational programming.

In 1984, the first of the regional networks in the country was created, [[Teleantioquia]] which signed on the next year. Other regional networks, such as [[Telecaribe]] and [[Telepacífico]], were created by the then-Minister of Communications [[Noemí Sanín]]. In the 1990s [[Canal 13 (Colombia)|Teveandina]], [[Telecafé]], and [[Teleislas]] would join them.
1987 saw the introduction of cable television to the country after bidding in 1985. [[TV Cable]] began operations at the end of December 1987.

The 1991 bid (for the 1992-1997 period) triggered competitiveness as a first step toward privatization. Cadena Dos became [[Canal A]], and the programming companies, which numbered 24 at the time, received from that point slots on one channel to compete among each other for [[Television content rating systems|rating]]s. Cadena Uno would be rebranded [[Canal Uno]] in January 1998.

The [[Colombian Constitution of 1991]] and a law in 1995 created the [[Comisión Nacional de Television]] (CNTV, ''National Television Commission''), an autonomous entity in charge of policies for public television and regulation of television contents. The CNTV started working in 1995.
In March 1993, more ratings information came to Colombian screens. A court decision forced Inravisión to ban sexual and violent scenes from the ''franja familiar'' (family block). ''Programadoras'' were now required to state if the program was appropriate for minors to view.&lt;ref&gt;"Programas de TV siguen en el aire." ''El Tiempo'' 31 March 1993: [http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-89897 link]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''programadoras'' had to submit their material to Inravisión 72 hours in advance to determine its suitability; television was classified in two types of ''franjas'', including the ''franja infantil'' and ''franja familiar'' (which determined the content rating of the programs to be aired in that block) as well as ratings for the profitability and value of the timeslots, ranging from AAA (prime time) to D (overnight hours).

In 1997, the government through the CNTV gave away licences to set up privately owned television networks. These licences were granted to [[Caracol TV|''Cadena radial colombiana'' (Caracol TV)]] and [[RCN TV|''Radio Cadena Nacional'' (RCN TV)]], which had started as radio networks and were in the hands of the main economic groups of Colombia. Both private stations began functioning as TV networks on 10 July 1998. 

The recession of the Colombian economy during the late 1990s weakened the state-run networks and the ''programadoras''. But the companies that produced the networks' shows also had to face a new landscape of Colombian television, as Caracol and RCN now dominated. Ratings fell steadily as the ''programadoras'' became merely production companies for Caracol or RCN or disappeared outright. Names famous in Colombian television, like PUNCH, Cenpro, [[Producciones JES]] (named for its founder Julio E. Sánchez Venegas), the famous [[24 Horas (Colombia)|Noticiero 24 Horas]], and [[TeVecine]], left the public airwaves. Others required financial intervention to stay afloat. The ''programadoras'' had continued working independently and never collaborated to establish a better program service against the newly organized privately owned networks.

By 2003, Canal A was almost entirely filled with cultural and educational programs produced by the government-run ''programadora'' (Audiovisuales).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX402j9jmXk 2003 schedule from Canal A — notice the high content of Audiovisuales programs]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the only production company left on Canal A was transferred to Canal Uno, which left four ''programadoras'' there to receive an equal share of the channel's program slots. Canal A then was turned into the ''[[Canal Institucional]]'' and became under total control of the government. Later in 2004, Inravisión would be [[liquidation|liquidated]] and [[Radio Televisión Nacional de Colombia]] was created.

In 2009 a licence for a third national private television network was to be granted by the Colombian government. Spanish groups [[PRISA]] and [[Grupo Planeta|Planeta]], and [[Venezuela]]n tycoon [[Gustavo Cisneros]] were bidding, each of them allied with Colombian shareholders, for the licence.{{update|date=May 2012}} As of November 2017, there is still no third private channel in Colombia.

== Digital television ==
'''Satellite and Cable'''

[[HDTV]]-ready television sets ([[DVB-C]]) have been available in Colombia since 2003. Ten years later [[cable television|cable]] companies started to broadcast HD content to their subscribers. [[Satellite television]], like DirecTV Colombia, offer HD channels.

'''Terrestrial'''

[[Señal Colombia]] —a state-owned channel— first made digital terrestrial television broadcast tests in 2006, in northwest [[Bogotá]] and downtown [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]. Transmissions were made in the three [[Digital television|DTV]] formats ([[ATSC]], DVB-T, and [[ISDB-T]]). Also the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] standard [[DMB-T/H]], was considered, but couldn't be tested.

On August 28, 2008, [[Colombia]] adopted the European [[digital terrestrial television]] standard, [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB-T]] using MPEG4 H.264 and a channel bandwidth of 6&amp;nbsp;MHz.

On December 28, 2010, [[Caracol TV]] and [[RCN TV]] officially started digital broadcasts&lt;ref name="caracolrcntdt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Caracol y RCN inician emisión digital terrestre|url=http://elespectador.com/entretenimiento/arteygente/medios/articulo-242579-caracol-y-rcn-inician-emision-digital-terrestre|accessdate=30 December 2010|newspaper=[[El Espectador]]|date=28 December 2010|author=[[EFE]]|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Bogotá, Medellín and surrounding areas on channels 14 and 15 [[UHF]] using DVB-T h264.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RESOLUCIÓN 389 DE 2010|url=http://cntv.org.co/cntv_bop/basedoc/resolucion/cntv/2010/resolucion_cntv_0389_2010.html|publisher=Comisión Nacional de Televisión|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=16 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707053325/http://cntv.org.co/cntv_bop/basedoc/resolucion/cntv/2010/resolucion_cntv_0389_2010.html|archivedate=2011-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Señal Colombia]] and [[Canal Institucional]] started test digital broadcasts earlier in 2010.&lt;ref name="caracolrcntdt" /&gt;

On January 9, 2012 [[Colombia]] adopted the latest European [[digital terrestrial television]] standard, [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB-T2]], using a channel bandwidth of 6&amp;nbsp;MHz. The reneging on their earlier decision to use DVB-T meant that many early adopters were left with incompatible set top boxes and televisions.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The transmitters in Bogotá and Medellín transmitted DVB-T2 and DVB-T in parallel (T2 started on 1 August 2012) for three years. DVB-T from these two masts was switched off in August 2015.

'''"This Is Acid,"''' also known by its full title, '''"This Is Acid (A New Dance Craze),"''' is a number one ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart single by Chicago [[house music]] DJ and record producer [[Maurice Joshua]], who recorded the track under his first name "Maurice." It reached the top spot in April 1989 and stayed there for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (2004). ''Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003,'' (Record Research Inc.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The song contains spoken lyrics performed by male singer "Hot Hands" Hula Mahone. The lyrics introduce the listener to the [[acid house|Chicago acid house]] sound.

==Versions==
The original 4:56 version—made with only a [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine, [[Roland TB-303]] bass synthesizer, reverb, and vocals—was first released as a B-side track on the Maurice Joshua with Hot Hands Hula single "I Gotta Big Dick" in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Maurice-Joshua-With-Hot-Hands-Hula-I-Gotta-Big-Dick/master/58959|title="I Gotta Big Dick" master release info at Discogs|accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only Mahone and producer [[Lidell Townsell]] were given writing credits.

When the song was later released as a separate single, the artist name was changed to just Maurice and the song was subtitled "A New Dance Craze". Most editions featured only sample-laden Les Adams remixes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Maurice-This-Is-Acid/master/85253|title="This Is Acid" master release info at Discogs|accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most popular of which makes repeated use of sirens and sexual screams in the background. These releases didn't mention Mahone or Townsell; they only credited Joshua as the only producer and writer, plus Les Adams and keyboardist Mike Stevens for the remixes. This version would later be included in the [[Trax Records]]' 20th Anniversary compilation set in 2006.

==Legacy==
"This Is Acid (A New Dance Craze)" was Joshua's only hit single, but he did go on to be a [[Grammy Award]]-winning producer and remixer.

"This Is Acid" was [[cover version|covered]] by German duo [[VooDoo &amp; Serano]] off their album ''Radikal Techno 6''.

The song can be heard in the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' on the in-game radio station [[Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas_soundtrack#SF-UR|SF-UR]].

"'''Tobacco'''" is a segment of the [[HBO]] news satire television series ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]'' about the [[tobacco industry]]. It first aired on February 15, 2015, as part of the second episode of the series' second season. During the eighteen-minute segment, comedian [[John Oliver]] discusses tobacco industry trends and practices.

Toward the end of the segment, Oliver introduces Jeff the Diseased Lung, a mascot he created for the American global cigarette and tobacco company [[Philip Morris International]], the makers of [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] cigarettes. The [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] diseased lung, who smokes and coughs, has been compared to [[Joe Camel]] and the [[Marlboro Man]]. Oliver and his team promoted the cartoon character by sending shirts with Jeff's image to [[Togo]] and displaying billboards in [[Uruguay]], and by encouraging use of the [[hashtag]] #JeffWeCan, which trended on [[Twitter]] following the broadcast.

After the segment, Philip Morris issued a response that received some criticism. The "Tobacco" segment received widespread media coverage, with several outlets praising Oliver's ability to launch successful marketing campaigns and change perceptions about smoking through the creation of the mascot. The Jeff caricature was later used at a May 2015 protest organized by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in [[New York City]].

He shows a video of [[Joseph Cullman]], the former CEO of the tobacco company [[Philip Morris International]] (PMI), saying that "some women would prefer having smaller babies" in response to a reporter's comment that pregnant women who smoke will give birth to smaller babies as a result.&lt;ref name="youtube-lwt20150215"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a reference for the quote, see:

Oliver then shows a clip of a tobacco farmer saying, "This is the best time ever to be a tobacco farmer." The comedian says that while American smoking rates have gone down, smoking rates in the rest of the world have gone up.&lt;ref name="youtube-lwt20150215"/&gt; He displays a [[viral video]] of a chain smoking baby in [[Indonesia]]&lt;ref name="youtube-lwt20150215"/&gt; who reportedly threw tantrums when he did not get to smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Dad says smoking toddler is ‘addicted’ | website=MSNBC | date=2010-05-26 | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/37358195/ns/health-childrens_health/t/dad-says-smoking-toddler-addicted/ | access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyersohn Harris 2011"/&gt; Oliver then states that the baby's favorite brand of cigarettes is owned by PMI, one of the tobacco companies that has "flocked" Indonesia and contributed to its smoking epidemic.&lt;ref name="youtube-lwt20150215"/&gt; He cites the [[World Health Organization]]'s report on the [[prevalence of tobacco consumption]], which stated that 67% of Indonesian males smoked in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/tobacco/surveillance/policy/country_profile/idn.pdf|title=WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic: Country Profile: Indonesia |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|date=2013|accessdate=December 4, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025034552/http://www.who.int/tobacco/surveillance/policy/country_profile/idn.pdf|archivedate=2013-10-25|deadurl=unfit&lt;!--technically not dead, but showing the 2013 stats--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shows an ABC News video of Indonesian schoolboys lighting cigarettes at a kiosk outside their school.&lt;ref name="youtube-lwt20150215"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyersohn Harris 2011"&gt;{{cite web | last=Meyersohn | first=Jon | last2=Harris | first2=Dan | title=From Age 2 to 7: Why Are Children Smoking in Indonesia? | website=ABC News | date=2011-09-12 | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/age-children-smoking-indonesia/story?id=14464140 | access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also says that PMI, by its own count, sells "seven of the world's top 15 international brands" of tobacco, including Marlboro.&lt;ref name="youtube-lwt20150215"/&gt;

Afterward, Oliver tells his viewers about tobacco companies' worldwide actions to "attack laws intended to protect public health".&lt;ref name="Tovey 2015"/&gt; One of these laws was in [[Australia]], where the federal government replaced all branding on [[cigarette packets in Australia|tobacco boxes]] with [[Plain tobacco packaging|"plain packaging"]] photographs that showed the effects of smoking, including "the toe tag on the corpse, the cancerous mouth, the nightmarish eyeball, [and] the diseased lung".&lt;ref name="youtube-lwt20150215"/&gt; He references the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Department of Health]], which states that smoking consumption had declined to historically low levels after the law was passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Tobacco control key facts and figures | website=Department of Health | date=2017-07-26 | url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/publications/publishing.nsf/Content/tobacco-control-toc | access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the passage of this legislation, [[British American Tobacco]] and [[Japan Tobacco]] unsuccessfully sued the Australian federal government in the [[High Court of Australia]] and, in the process, were forced to pay the government's legal fees.&lt;ref name="youtube-lwt20150215"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=JT International SA v Commonwealth of Australia | court=HCA |year=2012 |num=43 |parallelcite=JT International SA v Commonwealth of Australia, British American Tobacco Australasia Limited v The Commonwealth [2012] HCA 43 | date=2012-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PMI then transferred the ownership of its Australian division to one of its other businesses located in [[Hong Kong]],&lt;ref name="youtube-lwt20150215" /&gt; taking advantage of a treaty that prevented Australia from seizing the property of businesses located in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1993/30.html|title=Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Hong Kong for the Promotion and Protection of Investments|last=|first=|date=1993|publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010501215526/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1993/30.html|archive-date=2001-05-01|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; PMI Hong Kong then sued Australia's government in international court, claiming that Australia was stealing the brands on its boxes by adding the photographs of the effects of smoking.&lt;ref name="youtube-lwt20150215" /&gt; (PMI would lose this lawsuit as well in July 2017.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Knaus | first=Christopher | title=Philip Morris cigarettes charged millions after losing plain packaging case against Australia | website=the Guardian | date=2017-07-10 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/10/philip-morris-cigarettes-charged-millions-after-losing-plain-packaging-case-against-australia | access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oliver compares PMI's US$80 billion revenue in 2013 to Togo's $4.3 billion GDP during the same year. He then reads a cease-and-desist letter from PMI to the Togolese government and says that PMI had [[Cherry picking|cherry-picked]] a quote from the one dissenting judge in the Australia lawsuit who had ruled in favor of the tobacco industry. The comedian states that British American and its affiliates had sent similar letters to the governments of [[Namibia]] and the [[Solomon Islands]].&lt;ref name="youtube-lwt20150215" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Locker 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Locker | first=Melissa | title=Watch John Oliver Burn Big Tobacco | website=Time | date=2015-02-16 | url=http://time.com/3710949/john-oliver-tobacco/ | access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A performer in a Jeff costume appeared at Kick Butts Day, a protest organized by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and youth advocates, which was held outside Philip Morris' annual shareholders' meeting in [[New York City]] on May 6, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olmstead|first1=Erica|title=Youth advocates head to New York City to #StopMarlboro|url=http://www.kickbuttsday.org/updates/detail/2015_05_22_nyc|website=Kick Butts Day|publisher=Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids|accessdate=December 24, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225050033/http://www.kickbuttsday.org/updates/detail/2015_05_22_nyc|archivedate=December 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests featured a [[flash mob]] with fifty dancers performing a choreographed dance to a song with the lyrics, "We don't want your cigarettes. Jeff we can!" The performance ended with the mascot: "rolling around on the floor in a coughing fit and loss of breath". Shana Narula, the campaign's coordinator, said: &lt;blockquote&gt;The whole concept is to use Jeff and the hashtag #JeffWeCan and #StopMarlboro to show that these marketing tactics are not allowed and tobacco is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the world. And the fact is it's the only consumer product that when used as intended, it kills its user. This is very, very unique — no other consumer product does this. Most people think that tobacco is not really an issue in this country anymore and that's completely not true. That's what we want to shed light on today, in a fashion where people will take notice.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite web|last=Olson|first=Samantha|title=John Oliver's 'Jeff The Diseased Lung' Hits Times Square For Anti-Smoking Awareness Flash Mob|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/john-olivers-jeff-diseased-lung-hits-times-square-anti-smoking-awareness-flash-mob-332252|website=Medical Daily|publisher=[[IBT Media]]|accessdate=January 20, 2016|date=May 6, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119122228/http://www.medicaldaily.com/john-olivers-jeff-diseased-lung-hits-times-square-anti-smoking-awareness-flash-mob-332252|archivedate=January 19, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He informs us of real issues we otherwise wouldn't hear or think deeply about, which in and of itself is brilliant, but what really sets him apart is his way of calling his audience to action about these issues.

MediaPost Communications' ''Marketing Daily'' published an article called "What Marketers Can Learn from John Oliver", in which James G.

The power to spark a movement like Jeff the Diseased Lung isn't shared by Oliver's contemporaries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Frail|first=Alex|title=Why "Last Week Tonight" is the new champion of sanity in fake news|url=http://dailycollegian.com/2015/04/16/why-last-week-tonight-is-the-new-champion-of-sanity-in-fake-news/|accessdate=November 25, 2015|work=The Massachusetts Daily Collegian|date=April 16, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126072242/http://dailycollegian.com/2015/04/16/why-last-week-tonight-is-the-new-champion-of-sanity-in-fake-news/|archivedate=November 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey Wasserman, vice president and director of [[RAND Corporation|RAND Health]], opined: "John Oliver's 'Jeff' character is of course a mockery of an iconic figure, the Marlboro Man, whose legacy turned out to be cruelly ironic. As Oliver noted in his show, four former Marlboro men died of smoking-related causes. Let's hope that 'Jeff' going viral causes current and prospective smokers—mainly teens and preteens—to recognize cigarette smoking for what it is: the most deadly habit."&lt;ref name=Wasserman/&gt;

In July 2015, ''[[Slant Magazine]]''{{'s}} Julia Pressman describes the "Tobacco" segment in her article "The British Dude Who Is Winning America's War on Bullshit", in which she features five ways Oliver "has owned 2015 thus far".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pressman|first=Julia|title=The British Dude Who Is Winning America's War on Bullshit|url=https://www.slantnews.com/story/2015-07-04-all-the-ways-john-oliver-has-owned-2015-thus-far|website=[[Slant Magazine]]|accessdate=December 24, 2015|date=July 4, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225084459/https://www.slantnews.com/story/2015-07-04-all-the-ways-john-oliver-has-owned-2015-thus-far|archivedate=December 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website Inverse included the February 15 segment, the second most effective from the show's second season, saying it "may be the most lasting of the entire year". Furthermore, the website's Matthew Strauss wrote, "Jeff shows up when you Google Image-search 'Marlboro'; he's on bus stops in Uruguay; and he's on t-shirts in Togo. Jeff is an icon.

===Response by Philip Morris International===

[[Philip Morris International]] issued a statement which read in part: &lt;blockquote&gt;On February 15, 2015, the 'Last Week Tonight with John Oliver' show dedicated a significant portion of its program to our company [...] ''Last Week Tonight with John Oliver'' is a parody show, known for getting a laugh through exaggeration and presenting partial views in the name of humor. The segment includes many mischaracterizations of our company, including our approach to marketing and regulation, which have been embellished in the spirit of comedic license [...] While we recognize the tobacco industry is an easy target for comedians, we take seriously the responsibility that comes with selling a product that is an adult choice and is harmful to health [...] We support and comply with thousands of regulations worldwide – including advertising restrictions, penalties for selling tobacco products to minors, and substantial health warnings on packaging. We're investing billions into developing and scientifically assessing a portfolio of products that have the potential to be less harmful and that are satisfying so smokers will switch to them. And, like any other company with a responsibility to its business partners, shareholders and employees, we ask only that laws protecting investments, including trademarks, be equally applied to us.&lt;ref name=Parker/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The statement also provided readers with a "balanced view", and facts about the issues raised by Oliver, including the company's marketing practices and "approach to regulation". Philip Morris included links to its "Be Marlboro" campaign, which is "aimed at competing for existing adult smoker market share", reasons why the company is challenging Australia and Uruguay's censorship of their trademarks, and "facts about smoking prevalence in Australia after the introduction of plain packaging".&lt;ref name=Parker/&gt;

Chris Morran of ''[[Consumerist]]'' said Philip Morris did a "really poor job of trying to defend its actions". He wrote, "[...] this should be where the very serious folks at Philip Morris go point by point and explain where Oliver exaggerated and embellished, but they don't. It's a classic non-response in which the accused tried to undercut the accuser's argument by claiming he can't possibly be providing the truth."&lt;ref name=Morran/&gt; He noted that Philip Morris does not deny making legal threats to suppress regulations on cigarette packaging and questions how the company: "[expects] to be taken seriously when it readily admits that the products it sells are 'harmful to health'".&lt;ref name=Morran/&gt; Furthermore, Chris Morran takes aim at the company's claim that it "[supports] and [complies] with thousands of regulations worldwide", writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;[...] the tobacco industry doesn't support these regulations. It only supports the ones it can't fight in a courtroom. Once it loses a battle – or realizes a battle can't be won – then suddenly Big Tobacco, just like every other heavily regulated industry, claims to support and abide by the rules.&lt;ref name=Morran/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, he said of the statement's final sentence: "That's honestly the best Philip Morris and Big Tobacco can come up with – We've spent a lot of money and have a lot of investors so please don't mess with our packaging because it might cause us to earn smaller profits [...] It's an argument that might be tenable if cigarettes did anything other than poison the people who buy them – or live in the same house with them."&lt;ref name=Morran/&gt;

'''Vaudeville''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɔː|d|(|ə|)|v|ɪ|l}}; {{IPA-fr|vodvil|lang}}) is a [[theatre|theatrical]] [[genre]] of [[variety show|variety entertainment]] born in France at the end of the 1700s. A vaudeville is a comedy without psychological or moral intentions, based on a comical situation. It was originally a kind of dramatic composition or light poetry, usually a comedy, interspersed with songs or ballets. It became popular in the United States and Canada from the early 1880s until the early 1930s, but the idea of Vaudeville's theatre changed radically from its French antecedent.

In some ways analogous to [[music hall]] from Victorian Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vsforms.html |title=Forms of Variety Theater |date=1996 |work= |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a typical American vaudeville performance was made up of a series of separate, unrelated acts grouped together on a common bill. Types of acts have included popular and classical [[musician]]s, singers, [[dancer]]s, [[comedian]]s, [[animal training|trained animals]], [[Magician (illusion)|magicians]], [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquists]], [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongmen]], female and male impersonators, [[acrobatics|acrobats]], [[illustrated song]]s, [[jugglers]], one-act [[Play (theatre)|plays]] or scenes from plays, [[Sportsperson|athletes]], lecturing [[celebrities]], [[Minstrel show|minstrels]], and [[film|movies]]. A vaudeville performer is often referred to as a "vaudevillian".

Vaudeville developed from many sources, including the [[concert saloon]], [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]], [[freak show]]s, [[dime museum]]s, and literary [[American burlesque]]. Called "the heart of American show business", vaudeville was one of the most popular types of entertainment in [[North America]] for several decades.&lt;ref name=Trav&gt;{{cite book| last=Trav| first=S.D.| title=No Applause-Just Throw Money: The Book That Made Vaudeville Famous| date=October 31, 2006| publisher=Faber &amp; Faber| isbn=978-0865479586| url=https://www.amazon.com/No-Applause--Just-Throw-Money-Vaudeville/dp/0865479585/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1445889975&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=No+Applause-Just+Throw+Money%3A+The+Book+That+Made+Vaudeville+Famous#reader_0865479585| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The origin of this [[Terminology|term]] is obscure, but is often explained as being derived from the French expression ''voix de ville'' ("voice of the city"). A second speculation is that it comes from the 15th-century songs on satire by poet [[Olivier Basselin]], "Vaux de Vire".&lt;ref name="Kenrick"&gt;{{cite web| last=Kenrick| first=John| title=A History of The Musical: Vaudeville| url=http://www.musicals101.com/vaude1.htm| accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]]'' television series, science historian [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] argues that the term is a corruption of the French "Vau de [[Vire (river)|Vire]]" ("Vire River Valley", in English), an area known for its bawdy drinking songs and where [[Olivier Basselin|Basselin]] lived;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| title=An Invisible Object| last=Burke| first=James| author-link=James Burke (science historian)| medium=[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]]3 DVD| publisher=Ambrose Video Publishing, Inc.| date=September 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean le Houx circa 1610 collected these works as ''{{ill|Le Livre des Chants nouveaux de Vaudevire|fr}}'', which is probably the direct origin of the word. Some, however, preferred the earlier term "variety" to what manager [[Tony Pastor]] called its "sissy and Frenchified" successor. Thus, vaudeville was marketed as "variety" well into the 20th century.

With its first subtle appearances within the early 1860s, vaudeville was not initially a common form of entertainment. The form gradually evolved from the [[concert saloon]] and variety hall into its mature form throughout the 1870s and 1880s. This more gentle form was known as "Polite Vaudeville".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1=Frank| last1=Cullen| first2=Florence| last2=Hackman| first3=Donald| last3=McNeilly| chapter=Vaudeville History| title=Vaudeville, Old &amp; New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America| pages=xi-xxxii| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XFnfnKg6BcAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| location=London| publisher=Routledge| date=October 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years before the [[American Civil War]], entertainment existed on a different scale. Certainly, variety theatre existed before 1860 in Europe and elsewhere.  In the US, as early as the first decades of the 19th century, theatregoers could enjoy a performance consisting of Shakespeare plays, acrobatics, singing, dancing, and comedy.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} As the years progressed, people seeking diversified amusement found an increasing number of ways to be entertained. Vaudeville was characterized by traveling companies touring through cities and towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1513870/Television-in-the-United-States/283603/Variety-shows?anchor=ref1053883| title=Television in the United States| first=Robert J.| last=Thompson| encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]| date=February 4, 2014| accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A handful of circuses regularly toured the country; dime museums appealed to the curious; amusement parks, riverboats, and town halls often featured "cleaner" presentations of variety entertainment; compared to saloons, music halls, and [[American burlesque|burlesque]] houses, which catered to those with a taste for the ''risqué''. In the 1840s, the [[minstrel show]], another type of variety performance, and "the first emanation of a pervasive and purely American mass culture", grew to enormous popularity and formed what [[Nick Tosches]] called "the heart of 19th-century show business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Where Dead Voices Gather |last=Tosches |first=Nick |year=2002 |publisher=Back Bay Books |location=Boston |isbn=0-316-89537-7 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant influence also came from Dutch minstrels and comedians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor1-first=Nils| editor1-last=Grosch| editor2-first=Tobias| editor2-last=Widmaier| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObeD10YDRU0C&amp;pg=PA233| title=Lied und populäre Kultur/ Song and Popular Culture| language=German| page=233| publisher=Waxman Verlag GmbH| year=2010| location=Münster| isbn=978-383092395-4| quote=... the widespread influence Dutch minstrels and comedians had with their musical and dramaturgical idiom on vaudeville, the circuit of traveling tent shows.&amp;nbsp;...

Vaudeville incorporated these various itinerant amusements into a stable, institutionalized form centered in America's growing urban hubs.

In the early 1880s, [[impresario]] Tony Pastor, a circus ringmaster turned theatre manager, capitalized on [[middle class]] sensibilities and spending power when he began to feature "polite" variety programs in several of his [[New York City]] theatres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/vaudeville|title=vaudeville {{!}} entertainment|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual date given for the "birth" of vaudeville is October 24, 1881 at New York's [[Fourteenth Street Theatre]], when Pastor famously staged the first bill of self-proclaimed "clean" vaudeville in New York City.&lt;ref name="Kenrick"/&gt; Hoping to draw a potential audience from female and family-based shopping traffic [[Upper Manhattan|uptown]], Pastor barred the sale of liquor in his theatres, eliminated bawdy material from his shows, and offered gifts of coal and hams to attendees. Pastor's experiment proved successful, and other managers soon followed suit.

The manager's comments, sent back to the circuit's central office weekly, follow each act's description. The bill illustrates the typical pattern of opening the show with a "dumb" act to allow patrons to find their seats, placing strong acts in second and penultimate positions, and leaving the weakest act for the end, to clear the house.

As well, note that in this bill, as in many vaudeville shows, acts often associated with "lowbrow" or popular entertainment (acrobats, a trained mule) shared a stage with acts more usually regarded as "highbrow" or classical entertainment (opera vocalists, classical musicians).

[[Benjamin Franklin Keith|B. F. Keith]] took the next step, starting in [[Boston]], where he built an empire of [[theater (structure)|theatres]] and brought vaudeville to the US and Canada. Later, [[Edward Franklin Albee II|E. F. Albee]], adoptive grandfather of the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning playwright [[Edward Albee]], managed the chain to its greatest success. Circuits such as those managed by Keith-Albee provided vaudeville's greatest economic innovation and the principal source of its industrial strength. They enabled a chain of allied vaudeville houses that remedied the chaos of the single-theatre booking system by contracting acts for regional and national tours. These could easily be lengthened from a few weeks to two years.

Albee also gave national prominence to vaudeville's trumpeting "polite" entertainment, a commitment to entertainment equally inoffensive to men, women and children.  Acts that violated this ethos (e.g., those that used words such as "hell") were admonished and threatened with expulsion from the week's remaining performances or were canceled altogether. In spite of such threats, performers routinely flouted this censorship, often to the delight of the very audience members whose sensibilities were supposedly endangered. He eventually instituted a set of guidelines to be an audience member at his show, and these were reinforced by the ushers working in the theatre.&lt;ref name="Kenrick"/&gt;

This "polite entertainment" also extended to Keith's company members. He went to extreme measures to maintain this level of modesty. Keith even went as far as posting warnings backstage such as this: "Don't say 'slob' or 'son of a gun' or 'hully gee' on the stage unless you want to be canceled peremptorily&amp;nbsp;... if you are guilty of uttering anything sacrilegious or even suggestive you will be immediately closed and will never again be allowed in a theatre where Mr. Keith is in authority." Along these same lines of discipline, Keith's theatre managers would occasionally send out blue envelopes with orders to omit certain suggestive lines of songs and possible substitutions for those words. If actors chose to ignore these orders or quit, they would get "a black mark" on their name and would never again be allowed to work on the Keith Circuit. Thus, actors learned to follow the instructions given them by B.&amp;nbsp;F. Keith for fear of losing their careers forever.&lt;ref name="Kenrick"/&gt;

By the late 1890s, vaudeville had large circuits, houses (small and large) in almost every sizable location, standardized booking, broad pools of skilled acts, and a loyal national following. One of the biggest circuits was Martin Beck's [[Orpheum Circuit, Inc.|Orpheum Circuit]]. It incorporated in 1919 and brought together 45 vaudeville theatres in 36 cities throughout the US and Canada and a large interest in two vaudeville circuits. Another major circuit was that of [[Alexander Pantages]]. In his heyday, Pantages owned more than 30 vaudeville theatres and controlled, through management contracts, perhaps 60 more in both the US and Canada.

At its height, vaudeville played across multiple strata of economic class and auditorium size. On the vaudeville circuit, it was said that if an act would succeed in [[Peoria, Illinois]], it would work anywhere. The question "Will it play in Peoria?" has now become a metaphor for whether something appeals to the American mainstream public.  The three most common levels were the "small time" (lower-paying contracts for more frequent performances in rougher, often converted theatres), the "medium time" (moderate wages for two performances each day in purpose-built theatres), and the "big time" (possible remuneration of several thousand dollars per week in large, urban theatres largely patronized by the middle and upper-middle classes).  As performers rose in renown and established regional and national followings, they worked their way into the less arduous working conditions and better pay of the big time.  The capital of the big time was New York City's [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] (or just "The Palace" in the slang of vaudevillians), built by [[Martin Beck (vaudeville)|Martin Beck]] in 1913 and operated by Keith.  Featuring a bill stocked with inventive novelty acts, national celebrities, and acknowledged masters of vaudeville performance (such as comedian and trick roper [[Will Rogers]]), the Palace provided what many vaudevillians considered the apotheosis of remarkable careers. A standard show bill would begin with a sketch, follow with a single (an individual male or female performer); next would be an alley oop (an acrobatic act); then another single, followed by yet another sketch such as a blackface comedy. The acts that followed these for the rest of the show would vary from musicals to jugglers to song-and-dance singles and end with a final extravaganza – either musical or drama – with the full company. These shows would feature such stars as ragtime and jazz pianist [[Eubie Blake]], the famous and magical [[Harry Houdini]], and child star [[Baby Rose Marie]], adds Gilbert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gilbert| first=Douglas| title=American Vaudeville: Its Life and Times| year=1940| publisher=Whittlesey House}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[New-York Tribune]]''{{'}}s article about Vaudeville, it is said that at any given time, Vaudeville was employing over twelve thousand different people throughout its entire industry. Each entertainer would be on the road 42 weeks at a time while working a particular "Circuit" – or an individual theatre chain of a major company.&lt;ref name=OldNews&gt;{{cite web| last=Webwerks| title=''The New York Tribune'': Vaudeville| url=http://www.oldnewsads.com/Vaudeville.html| publisher=Oldnewsads.com| accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the neighborhood character of vaudeville attendance had always promoted a tendency to tailor fare to specific audiences, mature vaudeville grew to feature houses and circuits specifically aimed at certain demographic groups. Black patrons, often segregated into the rear of the second gallery in white-oriented theatres, had their own smaller circuits, as did speakers of [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]].  (For a brief discussion of Black vaudeville, see [[Theatre Owners Booking Association]].)  This foreign addition combined with comedy produced such acts as "minstrel shows of antebellum America" and Yiddish theatre. PBS adds that many of these ethnic families joined in on this entertainment business, and for them, this traveling lifestyle was simply a continuation of the adventures that brought them to America. Through these acts, they were able to assimilate themselves into their new home while also bringing bits of their own culture into this new world.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web| title=Vaudeville: About Vaudeville| url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/vaudeville/about-vaudeville/721/| publisher=[[PBS]] [[American Masters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; White-oriented regional circuits, such as [[New England]]'s "Peanut Circuit", also provided essential training grounds for new artists while allowing established acts to experiment with and polish new material.  At its height, vaudeville was rivaled only by churches and public schools among the nation's premiere public gathering places.

Another slightly different aspect of Vaudeville was an increasing intrigue with the female figure. The previously mentioned ominous idea of "the blue envelopes" led to the phrase "blue" material, which described the provocative subject matter present in many Vaudeville acts of the time.&lt;ref name="Kenrick"/&gt; Many managers even saw this scandalous material as a marketing strategy to attract many different audiences. As stated in Andrew Erdman's book ''Blue Vaudeville'', the Vaudeville stage was even marked with descriptions like, "a highly sexualized space&amp;nbsp;... where unclad bodies, provocative dancers, and singers of 'blue' lyrics all vied for attention." Such performances highlighted and objectified the female body as a "sexual delight", a phenomenon that historians believe emerged in the mid-19th century. But more than that, these historians think that Vaudeville marked a time in which the female body became its own "sexual spectacle" more than it ever had before. This sexual image began sprouting everywhere an American went: the shops, a restaurant, the grocery store, etc. The more this image brought in the highest revenue, the more Vaudeville focused on acts involving women. Even acts that were as innocent as a sister act were higher sellers than a good brother act. Consequently, Erdman adds that female Vaudeville performers such as Julie Mackey and Gibson's Bathing Girls began to focus less on talent and more on physical appeal through their figure, tight gowns, and other revealing attire. It eventually came as a surprise to audience members when such beautiful women actually possessed talent in addition to their appealing looks. This element of surprise colored much of the reaction to the female entertainment of this time.&lt;ref name=Erdman&gt;{{cite book| last=Erdman| first=Andrew L.| title=Blue Vaudeville| publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.| isbn=978-0786431151| date=January 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to vaudeville's prominence as a form of American entertainment, it reflected the newly evolving urban inner city culture and interaction of its operators and audience. Making up a large portion of [[immigration to the United States]] in the mid-19th century, Irish Americans interacted with established Americans, with the Irish becoming subject to discrimination due to their ethnic physical and cultural characteristics. The ethnic stereotypes of Irish through their greenhorn depiction alluded to their newly arrived status as immigrant Americans, with the stereotype portrayed in avenues of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Following the Irish immigration wave, several waves followed in which new immigrants from different backgrounds came in contact with the Irish in America's urban centers. Already settled and being native English speakers, Irish Americans took hold of these advantages and began to assert their positions in the immigrant racial hierarchy based on skin tone and assimilation status, cementing job positions that were previously unavailable to them as recently arrived immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The interactions between newly arrived immigrants and settled immigrants within the backdrop of the unknown American urban landscape allowed vaudeville to be utilized as an avenue for expression and understanding. The often hostile immigrant experience in their new country was now used for comic relief on the vaudeville stage, where stereotypes of different ethnic groups were perpetuated.&lt;ref name="Mintz1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mintz|first1=Lawrence E.|title=Humor and Ethnic Stereotypes in Vaudeville and Burlesque |url= http://melus.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/4/19 |journal=MELUS.

Coupled with their historical presence on the English stage for comic relief,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and as operators and actors of the vaudeville stage, Irish Americans became interpreters of immigrant cultural images in American popular culture. New arrivals found their ethnic group status defined within the immigrant population and in their new country as a whole by the Irish on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Conflict between Irish and African Americans saw the promotion of black-face [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]] on the stage, purposefully used to place African Americans beneath the Irish in the racial and social urban hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Although the Irish had a strong Celtic presence in vaudeville and in the promotion of ethnic stereotypes, the ethnic groups that they were characterizing also utilized the same humor. As the Irish donned their ethnic costumes, groups such as the Chinese, Italians, Germans and Jews utilized ethnic caricatures to understand themselves as well as the Irish.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book

The continued growth of the lower-priced cinema in the early 1910s dealt the heaviest blow to vaudeville. This was similar to the advent of free broadcast [[television]]'s diminishing the cultural and economic strength of the cinema. Cinema was first regularly commercially presented in the US in vaudeville halls. The first public showing of movies projected on a screen took place at [[Koster and Bial's Music Hall]] in 1896. Lured by greater salaries and less arduous working conditions, many performers and personalities, such as [[Al Jolson]], [[W. C. Fields]], [[Mae West]], [[Buster Keaton]], the [[Marx Brothers]], [[Jimmy Durante]], [[Bill Robinson|Bill "Bojangles" Robinson]], [[Edgar Bergen]], [[Fanny Brice]], [[Burns and Allen]], and [[Eddie Cantor]], used the prominence gained in live variety performance to vault into the new medium of cinema. In doing so, such performers often exhausted in a few moments of screen time the novelty of an act that might have kept them on tour for several years. Other performers who entered in vaudeville's later years, including [[Jack Benny]], [[Abbott and Costello]], [[Kate Smith]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Rose Marie]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Red Skelton]], and [[The Three Stooges]], used vaudeville only as a launching pad for later careers. They left live performance before achieving the national celebrity of earlier vaudeville stars, and found fame in new venues.

The line between live and filmed performances was blurred by the number of vaudeville entrepreneurs who made more or less successful forays into the movie business.  For example, [[Alexander Pantages]] quickly realized the importance of motion pictures as a form of entertainment. He incorporated them in his shows as early as 1902. Later, he entered into partnership with the [[Famous Players-Lasky]], a major Hollywood production company and an affiliate of [[Paramount Pictures]].

By the late 1920s, most vaudeville shows included a healthy selection of cinema.  Earlier in the century, many vaudevillians, cognizant of the threat represented by cinema, held out hope that the silent nature of the "flickering shadow sweethearts" would preclude their usurpation of the paramount place in the public's affection.  With the introduction of talking pictures in 1926, the burgeoning film studios removed what had remained the chief difference in favor of live theatrical performance: spoken dialogue.  Historian [[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|John Kenrick]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;Top vaudeville stars filmed their acts for one-time pay-offs, inadvertently helping to speed the death of vaudeville. After all, when "small time" theatres could offer "big time" performers on screen at a nickel a seat, who could ask audiences to pay higher amounts for less impressive live talent? The {{Not a typo|newly-formed}} [[RKO Pictures|RKO studios]] took over the famed [[Orpheum Circuit|Orpheum vaudeville circuit]] and swiftly turned it into a chain of full-time movie theatres. The half-century tradition of vaudeville was effectively wiped out within less than four years.&lt;ref name=KenrickLove&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/1927-30film2.htm "History of Musical Film, 1927-30: Part II"]. Musicals101.com, 2004, accessed May 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Inevitably, managers further trimmed costs by eliminating the last of the live performances.  Vaudeville also suffered due to the rise of broadcast radio following the greater availability of inexpensive receiver sets later in the decade.  Even the hardiest in the vaudeville industry realized the form was in decline; the perceptive understood the condition to be terminal.  The standardized film distribution and talking pictures of the 1930s confirmed the end of vaudeville. By 1930, the vast majority of formerly live theatres had been wired for sound, and none of the major studios were producing silent pictures. For a time, the most luxurious theatres continued to offer live entertainment, but most theatres were forced by the [[Great Depression]] to economize.

Some in the industry blamed cinema's drain of talent from the vaudeville circuits for the medium's demise. Others argued that vaudeville had allowed its performances to become too familiar to its famously loyal, now seemingly fickle audiences.

There was no abrupt end to vaudeville, though the form was clearly sagging by the late 1920s. [[Joseph Kennedy, Sr.]] in a hostile buyout, acquired the Keith-Albee-Orpheum Theatres Corporation (KAO), which had more than 700 vaudeville theatres across the United States which had begun showing movies.  The shift of New York City's Palace Theatre, vaudeville's epicenter, to an exclusively cinema presentation on November 16, 1932 is often considered to have been the death knell of vaudeville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Senelick |first=Laurence |editor-first=Don B.| editor-last=Wilmeth |title=Cambridge Guide to American Theatre |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=October 22, 2007 |page=480 |edition=Second |isbn=978-0521835381 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UYsXbFvjrXkC&amp;q=480#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; No single event is more reflective of its gradual withering.

Though talk of its resurrection was heard during the 1930s and later, the demise of the supporting apparatus of the circuits and the higher cost of live performance made any large-scale renewal of vaudeville unrealistic.

==Architecture==
The most striking examples of [[Gilded Age]] theatre architecture were commissioned by the big time vaudeville magnates and stood as monuments of their wealth and ambition. Examples of such architecture are the theatres built by impresario [[Alexander Pantages]].  Pantages often used architect [[B. Marcus Priteca]] (1881–1971), who in turn regularly worked with muralist [[Anthony Heinsbergen]].  Priteca devised an exotic, neo-classical style that his employer called "Pantages Greek".

Though classic vaudeville reached a zenith of capitalization and sophistication in urban areas dominated by national chains and commodious theatres, small-time vaudeville included countless more intimate and locally controlled houses.  Small-time houses were often converted saloons, rough-hewn theatres, or multi-purpose halls, together catering to a wide range of clientele.  Many small towns had purpose-built theatres.

==Vaudeville's cultural influence and legacy==
[[File:ray wollbrinck vaudeville sm.jpg|thumb|right|upright|As the genre declined, most performers left the theatre. The child [[tap dancer]] Ray Wollbrinck, once called "the cleverest [[buckdancer]] on the vaudeville stage", later became a bandleader and ended his days as a bank teller.]]

Some of the most prominent vaudevillians successfully made the transition to cinema, though others were not as successful.  Some performers such as [[Bert Lahr]] fashioned careers out of combining live performance with radio and film roles. Many others later appeared in the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskill]] resorts that constituted the "[[Borscht Belt]]".

Vaudeville was instrumental in the success of the newer media of film, radio, and television. Comedies of the new era adopted many of the dramatic and musical tropes of classic vaudeville acts. Film comedies of the 1920s through the 1940s used talent from the vaudeville stage and followed a vaudeville aesthetic of variety entertainment, both in Hollywood and in Asia, including China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://u.osu.edu/mclc/online-series/rea-jenkins/|title=The Ancient Art of Falling DownVaudeville Cinema between Hollywood and China|date=2017-08-29|work=MCLC Resource Center|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rich repertoire of the vaudeville tradition was mined for prominent prime-time radio [[variety show]]s such as ''The [[Rudy Vallée]] Show''. The structure of a single host introducing a series of acts became a popular television style and can be seen consistently in the development of television, from ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]'' in 1948 to ''[[Late Night With David Letterman]]'' in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Hilmes2010p97"&gt;{{cite book| last=Hilmes| first=Michele| date=February 12, 2010| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zG0YsRLUi18C&amp;pg=PA97| title=Only Connect: A Cultural History of Broadcasting in the United States| page=97| publisher=Cengage Learning| isbn=978-0495570516| quote=[...] it is in the form of the variety show itself, network radio's offspring, that we can see the influence of vaudeville on radio most clearly. From ''The Rudy Vallee Show'' through ''Jack Benny'' and ''Bing Crosby'' to TV programs like ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', ''The Smothers Brothers'', ''Saturday Night Live'', ''In Living Color'', and ''Late Night with David Letterman'', we can see strong remnants of  vaudeville's typical variety act structure. Combining a host/announcer with comedy sketches, musical performances, dance, monologues, and satiric banter--sometimes even animal acts--the variety show takes myriad forms today. The vaudeville circuit of touring companies and local theatres is gone, but it lives on electronically.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multi-act format had renewed success in shows such as ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'' with [[Sid Caesar]] and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.  Today, performers such as [[Bill Irwin]], a [[MacArthur Fellow]] and [[Tony Award]]-winning actor, are frequently lauded as "New Vaudevillians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957652-2,00.html| work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]| title=Theater: Bowing Out with a Flourish| date=1989-05-15| accessdate=2010-05-27| first=William A., III| last=Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/dialogue/dialogue_irwin_3.html |series=[[Great Performances]]| title=Bill Irwin: Clown Prince| network=PBS| airdate=December 15, 2004| season=32| accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

References to vaudeville and the use of its distinctive argot continue throughout Western popular culture. Words such as "flop" and "gag" were terms created from the vaudeville era and have entered the American idiom. Though not credited often, vaudevillian techniques can commonly be witnessed on television and in movies.

In [[professional wrestling]], there was a noted tag team, based in [[WWE]], called [[The Vaudevillains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/96-wwe/37365-wwe-nxt-report-6-6-tampa|title=WWE NXT report 6-6 Tampa|work=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=June 7, 2014|author=White, James|accessdate=November 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, noted film director Christopher Annino, maker of a new silent feature film, ''Silent Times'', founded Vaudeville Con, a gathering to celebrate the history of vaudeville. The first meeting was held in [[Pawcatuck, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.broadwayworld.com/connecticut/article/First-International-Vaudeville-Con-Food-Drive-For-Pawcatuck-Neighborhood-Center-20180925 “First International Vaudeville Con Food Drive For Pawcatuck Neighborhood Center”].

'''Vietnam Television''', or '''VTV''' ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: ''Đài Truyền hình Việt Nam''), is the national television broadcaster of [[Vietnam]].

==History==
The first television broadcast in Vietnam was in 1966 when the [[United States]] set up 2-channels (1-[[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and 1-[[English language|English]]) in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] for the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]]. Named [[Vietnam Television (1966–75)|Đài Truyền hình Việt Nam]] (Vietnam Television), the network operated until the [[fall of Saigon]].

VTV was established with technical assistance and training from [[Cuba]] on 6 September 1970, in [[Hanoi]], as a department of [[Voice of Vietnam]]. During the [[Vietnam War]] it broadcast intermittently from a mountainous region.

After [[History of Vietnam#Aftermath of the Vietnam War and Reunification|reunification]] in 1975, the former US-run stations in the south became part of the national network, and broadcasting was extended to the entire country.

[[Color television]] was experimented in 1978 and adopted the French [[SECAM]] standard and fully implemented in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vtv.vn/hoat-dong-vtv/gioi-thieu.htm Giới thiệu VTV - Đài Truyền Hình Việt Nam | VTV.VN]&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam Television became an official name on 30 April 1987. And by 1990, VTV viewers had two national TV channels to choose from as VTV2 was launched and that year switched to [[PAL]].&lt;ref name=VTV1&gt;[http://www.vtv.org.vn/en/ VTV Official Site - Overall] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703170229/http://www.vtv.org.vn/en/ |date=3 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VTV3&gt;[http://www.vtv.org.vn/en/important.htm VTV Official Site - Milestones] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127050950/http://www.vtv.org.vn/en/important.htm |date=27 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VTV's regional broadcasting centres are located in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Huế]], [[Da Nang]], [[Phu Yen]], [[Nha Trang]], and [[Cần Thơ]]. Programming is relayed nationwide via a network of provincial and municipal television stations. There are transmitters in most outlying areas of the country. By 2003, more than 80% of all urban households owned a television set. The percentage was considerably less in rural areas, but even the most remote village cafe has a TV and [[VHS|video]] or [[DVD]] player.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In addition, each major city and most of the 51 [[Provinces of Vietnam|provinces]] have their own television stations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Changes to VTV regional channels were made on January 1, 2016. [[VTV Huế]], [[VTV Đà Nẵng]], and [[VTV Phú Yên]] ceased programming and became '''VTV8''', a specific channel for Central and Highland Regions of Vietnam. Both the ''old'' '''VTV9''' (which was only for Ho Chi Minh City and [[Southeast (Vietnam)|Southeast Vietnam]] regions) and [[VTV Cần Thơ 1]] (which was only for [[Cần Thơ City]] and [[Hậu Giang Province]]) merged to form the ''new'' '''VTV9''' for both southeast and southwest of Vietnam, while [[VTV Cần Thơ 2]] was renamed '''VTV5 Tây Nam Bộ''', a bilingual Khmer-Vietnamese channel and the first regional variation of VTV5. 

On October 17 2016, '''VTV5 Tây Nguyên''', a channel for ethnic minorities in Central Highlands of Vietnam and another regional variation of VTV5, was also launched.

==Programming==
VTV has its own film production company, the Vietnam Television Film Centre (formerly Vietnam Television Film Company), or VFC, which makes [[Television movie|made-for-television movies]] and [[miniseries]]. However, only about 30% of the entertainment programming shown on VTV is made locally. The rest is imported and dubbed in Vietnamese. Shows include Korean and Chinese [[Soap opera|serial melodramas]], which are the mainstay of nightly programming on VTV3.

Aside from news and current affairs programming, VTV1 devotes itself to orchestral concerts, ballets, traditional theatre, ethnic minority culture shows and films.

Also, on Vietnamese New Year's Eve, VTV broadcasts some programmes and comedy show like Year's Last Afternoon, News Special, [[Gặp nhau cuối năm]], music concerts, and firework shows, until 2 or 1 am.

==Criticism and controversies==
{{Overly detailed|section|date=June 2017}}
VTV4 has been criticised by Vietnamese emigrees who find the channel's one-sided support of the one-party Communist state distressing and offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/01/1070127351359.html|title=Crunch time for SBS over Vietnamese news bulletin|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/19/1071337155787.html?from=storyrhs|title=Breaking the news at SBS|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thanh Niên News, on 28 February 2016, VTV admitted that it had used copyrighted content without permission in some of its programs, confirming that the violation has caused its YouTube channel to be blocked. On this day, VTV, was notified by YouTube that the video sharing website had received multiple third-party claims of copyright infringement regarding videos on its official YouTube page.  The page was blocked the following morning. VTV then told local press that some of its editors used some footage they found online in their news and current affairs programs without asking permission of the copyright holders. The programs were then uploaded on the YouTube page. The case was exposed after Bui Minh Tuan, 35, reported to Google that VTV had repeatedly used his flycam videos, posted on his YouTube page named Yamaha Trung Ta, without seeking his permission. Tuan, who runs a motorcycle trading company in the central province of Quang Tri, told news website ICTNews he had spent a lot of time and money to produce the aerial videos capturing beautiful scenes across the country. He claimed that over the previous year he had sent many complaints to VTV, the Department of Copyright and the Ministry of Information and Communications to report around 20 copyright violations by VTV, but no response was received.  Tuan decided to report the case to Google, the owner of YouTube. Since September he has reportedly filed three complaints. He told ICTNews he is not trying to seek damages and that he wants VTV to respect copyright laws. Tuan said VTV needs to make a public apology to him in a news program and hold a press conference on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.thanhniennews.com/society/national-network-vtv-admits-to-copyright-infringement-after-youtube-block-59820.html|title=National network VTV admits to copyright infringement after YouTube block|publisher= 3 March 2016|accessdate= 6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pirates of the Sky 35.jpg|thumb|250px|Wheel of Death performance at the New York State Fair in 2008]]
The '''Wheel of Death''', in the context of acrobatic [[circus arts]], is a large rotating apparatus on which performers carry out synchronized acrobatic skills. The "wheel" is actually a large [[space frame]] beam with hooped tracks at either end, within which the performers can stand. As the performers run around on either the inside or outside of the hoops, the whole apparatus rotates. Performers also perform balancing skills with the wheel in a stationary position.

The Wheel of Death is said to have originated in America during the early 1930s and was also known as the '''Space Wheel'''. Some early versions were performed by a single artist and incorporated a counterbalance on the other end. Following fatal accidents, the apparatus fell out of favour for a time until it was re-introduced in the 1970s under the name ''Wheel of Death''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.sabungee.co.za/wheel.htm
 |title = The Wheel of Death

 |accessdate = 2007-11-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its 2007 touring edition, [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Ringling Bros.]] started using the name '''Wheel of Steel''', as the word ''death'' was not seen as family friendly from a [[public relations]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/30/arts/30circ.html | work=The New York Times | title=With the Greatest of Ease | first=Glenn | last=Collins | date=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted artists who have performed on the wheel include [[Nik Wallenda]], [[Elvin Bale]] and [[Bello Nock]].

The Wheel Of Death is also used on modern cruise ferries such as M/S Silja Symphony and M/S Silja Serenade owned by Tallink Silja Line.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8020">The annual '''World Pie Eating Championship''' is usually held at ''Harry's Bar'' on Wallgate, [[Wigan]], [[Greater Manchester]], [[England]]. The competition has been held since 1992. In November 2006, a vegetarian version was added&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/food/Story/0,,1955147,00.html|title=Pie-eating championship goes slimline|work=guardian.co.uk|date=23 November 2006|location=London|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;  after "relentless pressure", from [[The Vegetarian Society]]'s Keith Lorraine and Phil English.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/7142115.stm|title=Dog jeopardises pie championships|date=13 December 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Imported pies===
In December 2005, controversy was caused, when pies were imported from nearby [[Farnworth]], [[Bolton]], and local Wigan pies were sidelined as it was believed they were substandard, resulting in a four-man strong protest, which included Lee Hartney of [[The Smith Street Band]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/food/story/0,,1668818,00.html|title=I ate all the pies|work=The Guardian|date=16 December 2005|last=Lewis|first=Paul|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, a similar situation arose, with pies being sourced from [[Adlington, Lancashire|Adlington]].&lt;ref name="guardian2009"/&gt;

===Quantity to speed===
In November 2006, more controversy was caused, when the competition was changed (to meet government ''healthy eating'' guidelines) from the number of pies consumed in a given time, to the fastest time to consume a single pie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6175726.stm|title=Health drive hitting pie eaters|date=23 November 2006|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of stock===
In December 2007, controversy struck again for the third year running, when the competition actually ran out of pies before the competition had finished.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Wrongly sized pies===
In December 2014, pies of the wrong size were delivered to the event, while the intended pies were sent to a nearby divorce party. The contestants competed with halved pies, but the results were nullified.&lt;ref name="bbc2014"/&gt; The head of the ''World Pie Eating Championship'' went to court on the television show ''[[Judge Rinder]]'' because of this, against the pie maker of the wrongly sized pies, but was awarded nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/judge-rinders-latest-case-sees-7598373|title=Judge Rinder's latest case sees him rule on a disputed PIE-EATING competition|last=Armstrong|first=Jeremy|website=mirror|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This very article was featured as evidence in the episode, referred to as "an online encyclopaedia website" by [[Robert Rinder]]. Last names were removed however, to protect identities and possibly copyright issues.

==Background==
Wiganers are proud to be called pie eaters, but the nickname is not thought to be because of their appetite for the delicacy. The name is said to date from the 1926 [[General Strike]], when Wigan miners were starved back to work, before their counterparts in surrounding towns and were forced to eat "[[humble pie]]".&lt;ref name=men /&gt;

'''Wyrd Miniatures''' produces a range of 32&amp;nbsp;mm metal and plastic miniatures, in several genres, for painters and gamers. Established and offering its first miniatures in 2005, the company is owned by Nathan Caroland and Eric Johns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cgov.sos.state.ga.us/Account.aspx/ViewEntityData?entityId=410335 Georgia Secretary of State Corporations Division, entered 13.2.2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Wyrd published its first game, [[Malifaux]], set in a dystopian city in a parallel world. In 2011 they introduced the board game [[Puppet-Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletopgamingnews.com/2011/08/18/49767/ Tabletop Gaming News announcement. Retrieved 13.2.2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first years the company focused on casting miniatures for the wargaming and miniature painting market. According to Eric Johns, it started with Nathan putting together a few fun minis after having gotten friendly with a sculptor. It was only in 2007 he and Nathan decided to push forward as a real company and started developing their own game rules to go with their miniatures line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingdice.com/2713/interview-eric-johns-of-wyrd-miniatures-publisher-of-malifaux/ Interview on Livingdice June 6, 2009, retrieved February 13, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release of Malifaux in 2009, which incorporated most of the miniature range, came a time of rapid expansion, and in March 2011 the company moved for the second time in 16 months allegedly to accommodate its growth, settling into a larger office and warehouse facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletopgamingnews.com/2011/03/21/44934/ Press release on Tabletop Gaming News March 21, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the partnership with Ghost Studio led to Wyrd introducing a new line of plastic miniatures for Malifaux using an all-digital manufacturing workflow, the so-called Freeform 3D solution from [[Geomagic]]. According to Geomagic, their platform for designing organic shaped products can sculpt, texture or emboss products with detail and articulation that traditional geometric CAD solutions simply cannot handle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geomagic.com/en/community/press-releases/as-gamers-descend-on-gen-con-2012-wyrd-miniatures-shows-the-not-/ Press release from Geomagic August 15, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plasticstoday.com/articles/additive-manufacturing-rapid-tooling-give-gamers-intricate-miniatures-fast-0822220123 Article on Platicstoday August 22, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
