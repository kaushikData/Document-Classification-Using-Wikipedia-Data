[[File:Chisinau riot 2009-04-07 04.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Riot]] in front of the [[Parliament of Moldova|Moldovan Parliament]], 7 April 2009]]
{{wikinews|Election in Moldova instigates rioting mob demanding recount}}
Protests against the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, April 2009|April 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election]] results, began on 6 April 2009, in major cities of [[Moldova]] (including [[Bălți]] and the capital, [[Chișinău]]) before the final official results were announced. The demonstrators claimed that the elections, which saw the governing [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]] (PCRM) win a majority of seats, were fraudulent, and alternatively demanded a recount, a new election, or resignation of the government. Similar demonstrations took place in other major Moldovan cities, including the country's second largest, Bălți, where over 7,000 people protested.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Some of the protesters discussed and organized themselves using [[Twitter]], hence its moniker used by the media, the '''''Twitter Revolution'''''.&lt;ref name="twitterrevolution"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,618563,00.html "Twitter Revolution: Fearing Uprising, Russia Backs Moldova's Communists"], Spiegel, 10 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Moldovas_Twitter_Revolution/1605005.html "Moldova's "Twitter Revolution""], RFE/RL, 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Moldova forces regain control of parliament after 'Twitter revolution'| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/08/moldova-protest-election-chisinau | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | date = 8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://adevarul.ro/moldova/actualitate/Sapte-ani-revolutia-twitter-chisinau-tatal-valeriu-boboc-tanarul-murit-piata-marii-adunari-nationale-7-aprilie-e-taina-1_5705e8e05ab6550cb8b76546/index.html Şapte ani de la „revoluţia Twitter“ de la Chişinău. Tatăl lui Valeriu Boboc, tânărul care a murit în Piaţa Marii Adunări Naţionale: „7 aprilie e o taină“]. adevarul.ro&lt;/ref&gt; In Chișinău, where the number of protesters rose above 30,000, the demonstration escalated into a riot on 7 April. Rioters attacked the [[Parliament of the Republic of Moldova|parliament building]] and [[President of Moldova|presidential office]], breaking windows, setting furniture on fire and stealing property.

==Background==
The unrest began as a public protest after the announcement of preliminary election results on 6 April 2009, which showed the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]] victorious, winning approximately 50% of the votes. Final results, published on 8 April, showed that the PCRM garnered 49.48% of the vote, gaining 60 parliament seats – one less than the three-fifths required for the party to control the presidential election. The opposition rejected the election results, accusing the authorities of falsification in the course of counting the votes and demanded new elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unimedia.info/stiri/-10249.html "30 000 de protestatari au spart uşile Parlamentului şi ale Preşedinţiei"], UNIMEDIA, 7 April.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/846556/Tinerii-zgaltaie-comunismul-la-Chişinău/ "Tinerii zgâlţâie comunismul la Chişinău"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7989919.stm "Eyewitness: Moldova protests"], BBC, 8 April.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PCRM has been in power since 2001. A series of protests have been organized by opposition parties in 2003, when the government attempted to replace the school subject "History of the Romanians" with "History of Moldova". Students protested for months before the government backed down on its plans.&lt;ref name="identitaire"&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2009/04/10/01003-20090410ARTFIG00457-le-probleme-identitaire-au-coeur-de-la-crise-en-moldavie-.php «Le problème identitaire au coeur de la crise en Moldavie»], ''Le Figaro'', 15 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Petru Negură, a university professor of sociology at the [[Moldova State University]] and the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences]], France, attributed the origins of the crisis to the ethnic identity problem: some people in Moldova identify themselves as "Moldovans", while others as "Romanians".&lt;ref name="identitaire"/&gt;

The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) International Election Observing Mission declared the elections generally free and fair, although it also reported that the comparison of data on the voting age population provided by the Moldovan Ministry of the Interior with the number of registered voters provided by local executive authorities revealed a discrepancy of some 160,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2009/04/37142_en.pdf "Statement of Preliminary Findings and Conclusions"], ''International Election Observation Mission'', ''[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] [[Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights]]'', 6 April 2009. Accessed 2009-07-22.

A number of voters have also reported cases of fraud where deceased and nonattendant persons were registered as having voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://www.cotidianul.ro/cum_voteaza_mortii_in_republica_moldova-79772.html "Cum votează morţii în Republica Moldova"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410144603/http://cotidianul.ro/cum_voteaza_mortii_in_republica_moldova-79772.html |date=2009-04-10 }}, ''cotidianul.ro'', 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://garda.com.md/stiri/fraude-non-stop-semnaturi-false-in-liste "Fraude Non-stop: semnături false în liste"], ''Ziarul de Gardă'', 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-opinii-5560303-revolta-anticomunista-republica-moldova.htm "Revolta anticomunista in Republica Moldov"], ''HotNews.ro'', 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Vladimir Socor]], a political analyst for the [[Jamestown Foundation]], the elections were evaluated as positive on the whole, with some reservations not affecting the outcome or the overall initial assessment.&lt;ref name="socor"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ten Reasons Why the Communist Party Won Moldova's Elections Again |url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=34821&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=60102286c5 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ih2SlIbM?url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=34821&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=60102286c5 |archivedate=2009-08-01 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exit poll]]s had showed a comfortable win for the Communist Party, with the only uncertainty being the size of the winning margin.&lt;ref name="socor"/&gt;

Opposition parties pointed out that the lists of eligible voters included 300,000 more people compared to the previous elections, although the population of Moldova has been shrinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e68dea9a-2abf-11de-8415-00144feabdc0.html "Moldova threatens Europe’s eastern overtures"], ''Financial Times'', 17 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, they claimed that around 400,000 fictive voters have been created in the last two months and, therefore, changed the voting result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://www.timpul.md/news/2009/04/15/1642 "În două luni au fost clonaţi 400 de mii de moldoveni "], ''Timpul'', 15 April 2009.

The first demonstrations, organized as a [[flashmob]] by a 25-year-old Moldovan journalist [[Natalia Morar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/09/moldova-parliament-communist-demonstrators|title=Moldova claims Romania plotted attempted coup|last=Luke|first=Hading|date=9 April 2009|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=2009-04-10 |location=London|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090412092930/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/09/moldova-parliament-communist-demonstrators|archivedate= 12 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; began in Chişinău on 6 April 2009, with a larger number of demonstrators arriving on the next day, 7 April. The demonstration, numbering over ten thousand, most of them students and young people, gathered in the city center on Ştefan cel Mare boulevard.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Cohen, [http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/07/moldovans-turn-to-twitter-to-organize-protests/ "Moldovans Turn to Twitter to Organize Protests"], ''The Lede'', a ''[[New York Times]]'' blog, 7 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=13447119 "Protests in Moldova: Moldova burning"], ''[[The Economist]]'', 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The protest against the announced election results turned into clashes with the police, who used [[tear gas]] and [[water cannons]]. However, the police were soon overwhelmed by the number of the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/world/-Moldovans-try-to-burn.5151247.jp "Moldovans try to burn parliament in protest at 'rigged' poll"], ''The Scotsman'', 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Rioters broke into the nearby parliament building and the office of president. Entering the building through broken windows, demonstrators set parts of the building on fire, using documents and furniture both inside and outside. The building was retaken by the police later in the evening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7988893.stm "Police retake Moldova parliament"], ''BBC'', 7 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The protesters, some of which carried Romanian flags,&lt;ref name="BBC10Apr"/&gt; chanted pro-Western, [[Movement for unification of Romania and Moldova|pro-Romanian]] and anti-government slogans such as "We want Europe", "We are Romanians"&lt;ref name="BBC10Apr"/&gt; and "Down with Communism".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2009/04/07/world/0407-MOLDOVA_9.html "Anti-Communist Protests in Moldova"], ''The New York Times'', 7 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two teenagers, Ion Galaţchi and Dragoş Musteţea, with the alleged approval of the policemen, replaced the [[Flag of Moldova|Flags of Moldova]] at the Presidential and Parliament buildings with a [[Flag of Romania]] and a [[Flag of Europe]], claiming that they expected that this would calm the crowd.&lt;ref name="presedintiei1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unimedia.info/stiri/-14502.html "Imagini privind arborarea Tricolorului"], ''UNIMEDIA'', 16 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}}  [http://www.cotidianul.ro/eroul_de_la_Chişinău_s_a_autodenuntat_la_televiziunea_lui_iurie_rosca_video-80503.html "“Eroul” de la Chişinău s-a autodenunţat la televiziunea lui Iurie Roşca (Video)"], ''Cotidianul'', 13 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergency hospital of Chişinău reported treating over 78 injured police officers and protesters on 8 April,&lt;ref name="newsmoldova"&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://newsmoldova.md/news.html?nws_id=813342 "La Spitalul de urgenţă din Chişinău s-au adresat 78 de răniţi"], ''Noutati Moldova'', 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; while the Moldovan president stated that 270 people were injured in the riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/846596/Revolta-de-la-Chişinău-Ziua-III--VIDEO/ "Revolta de la Chişinău. Ziua III"], ''EVZ.ro'', 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Moldovan opposition called on the authorities to carry out new elections and on the demonstrators to cease violence. Moldovan national television had initially reported that a young woman died of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] due to the fires within the parliament building set off by the rioters.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/08/world/europe/08moldova.html?_r=1|title=Protests in Moldova Explode, With Help of Twitter |first= Ellen|last= Barry |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= 7 April 2009 |accessdate= 2009-04-08|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130328194437/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/08/world/europe/08moldova.html?_r=1|archivedate=28 March 2013&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later reported that the woman was saved by a team of medics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.interfax.ru/news.asp?id=73015 "Пострадавшая при пожаре в Кишиневе девушка выжила"], ''[[Interfax]]'', 7 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 7 April, a group of protesters organised a National Salvation Committee, consisting of student and civic representatives. Writer [[Nicolae Dabija (politician)|Nicolae Dabija]], a vice-president of the Committee said that the intended purpose of the Committee is to organise new elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://www.realitatea.net/la-Chişinău-a-fost-organizat-un-comitet-al-salvarii-nationale_491457.html "La Chişinău a fost organizat un Comitet al Salvării Naţionale"], ''Realitatea'', 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the protests died off as the police intervened during the night to arrest the protesters found in the square.

On 7 April, [[Serafim Urechean]], leader of the opposition [[Party Alliance Our Moldova]], during a meeting with [[President of Moldova|President]] Voronin said that the riots were orchestrated by security services.&lt;ref name=rfe-09-04-2009&gt;Caolson, Robert, [http://www.rferl.org/content/Chişinău_Unrest_Exposes_Moldovas_Fault_Lines/1605757.html "Chişinău Unrest Exposes Moldova's Fault Lines"], ''Radio Free Europe'', 9 April 2009.

He said that there is no need to look further to explain the unrest and the movement "didn't have any leaders, one part went in one direction, a peaceful one and another part took a violent turn."&lt;ref name=rfe-09-04-2009/&gt;

Protests of solidarity with demonstrators in Chișinău took place in [[Cimișlia]], [[Bălți]], [[Ungheni]] and other Moldovan cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=tE-WSoZgYeU|title=Protest in Cimișlia on April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in some cities (especially in the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]]) the actions of the protesters were condemned.

The protests continued on Sunday, 12 April, when around 3,000 protesters gathered in the central square where the [[mayor of Chişinău]], [[Dorin Chirtoacă]], held a speech about how Moldova's youth reject Communism because they "understand that their future has been stolen". However, the students were notably absent from the crowd, having been sanctioned for their participation in the previous protests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/world/europe/13moldova.html "Moldovan Capital’s Mayor Speaks Against Communism"], ''New York Times'', 12 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrests and accusations of torture==
On the night following 7 April, around 1&amp;nbsp;AM, police forces routed the remaining crowds in the main square and arrested about 200 participants. On the following day, more arrests were issued, with demonstrators beaten and transported away in police cars.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} Similarly, footage showed demonstrators getting dragged away and beaten by what appears to be plain-clothes police officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Protesters_Beaten_In_Moldova/1605638.html "Protesters Beaten In Moldova"], Radio Free Europe, 9 April 2009.

She reported that she was abused by a police officer.&lt;ref name="amnesty"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/moldova-civil-society-activists-risk-arrest-20090408|website=amnesty.org|title=Moldova: Civil society activists at risk of arrest|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] accused the Moldovan government of violating human rights through the actions of the police, that it detained indiscriminately hundreds of protesters, including minors, who were subjected to [[torture]] and other ill-treatment.

On 13 April, Chişinău mayor Dorin Chirtoacă made an appeal to international organizations regarding the arrests in Moldova, claiming that the protesters had been tortured, not given the right to talk to a lawyer and that NGOs were not allowed access to the detention centres. He also claimed that the real number of arrestees was higher than the official figures, as the list compiled by the press of missing protesters reached 800 names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://www.Chişinău.md/news/?nid=7fa19b88c5a5d0df07b403139baa5f1c "Apelul primarului general al municipiului Chişinău, Dorin Chirtoacă"], ''Chişinău City Hall'', 13 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

"They killed him, that's for sure, and they must answer for what they've done" said Eugen's father.

Maxim Canişev (born 1989, [[Hristoforovca, Ungheni|Hristoforovca]]) died on 8 April, but was found with his spinal column broken in [[Ghidighici Lake]] only on 18 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdg.md/investigatii/calcul-politienesc-un-sinucigas-doi-sinucigasi|title=Calcul poliţienesc: un sinucigaş – doi sinucigaşi|work=Ziarul de Gardă|accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes of their deaths remain unknown as of 2010.

On 8 October 2009, hundreds of people came to [[Stephen the Great Monument]] in Chişinău to mark 6 months from the bloody events. While attending the ceremony, the [[Prime Minister of Moldova|prime minister]] [[Vlad Filat]] said that the [[Moldovan Ministry of the Interior|Ministry of the Interior]] has already started a domestic investigation into the police's actions on 7 April 2009, and especially during subsequent days and weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infotag.md/news-en/580782/ MEMORY OF APRIL EVENT VICTIMS VENERATED IN MOLDOVA AND ROMANIA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720195947/http://www.infotag.md/news-en/580782/ |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government reaction==
Moldovan President [[Vladimir Voronin]], in an address on 7 April 2009, described the events in the capital as a [[coup d'état]] organised by "a handful of fascists drunk with anger" and declared that the Moldovan authorities will defend themselves against the "leaders of the pogrom".&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://ziua.net/news.php?data=2009-04-08&amp;id=25205 Delirul lui Voronin: "Demonstrantii sunt fascisti; ne vom apara impotriva pogromului"], ''Ziua'', 8 April 2009 {{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President also urged the West to help restore order and resolve the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/1010/42/376012.htm |title= Moldovan Leader Calls Violence a Coup Attempt |date= 8 April 2009 |accessdate= 2009-04-07 |work= [[Moscow Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the escalation of the riots and the burning of the parliament building, Voronin said "we tried to avoid bloodshed, but if yesterday's situation will be repeated, we will respond accordingly".&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/846610/Voronin-Romania-se-afla-in-spatele-revoltei-de-la-Chişinău--VIDEO "Voronin: România se află în spatele revoltei de la Chişinău "], ''EVZ.ro'', 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on 8 April, [[Vladimir Voronin|Voronin]] made the following statement: "For the first time, the Moldovan people saw the opposition openly betray their own people and their own country by taking the path of provoking open civil war. The whole country saw that there is no opposition whatsoever in Moldova — neither anti-Communist, nor anti-Voronin. There is only opposition to the state." The President also commented on the displaying of [[Romanian flag]]s: "What happened yesterday brought indelible shame on our politicians, on the whole of our democracy. The entire Moldovan nation witnessed the greatest humiliation of its own sovereignty and its own democracy when the state standards were ripped from the flagpoles of Parliament and the President's Office and replaced with the flags of Romania."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20090408/120988312.html|title=Moldovan leader accuses opposition of betrayal|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2009-04-08|accessdate=2009-04-08|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090411065738/http://en.rian.ru/world/20090408/120988312.html|archivedate= 11 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'', Voronin claimed the professors and teachers, especially in Chişinău, have a very destructive role as "continuators of [[Ion Antonescu]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/ingreso/Rumania/UE/ha/complicado/cosas/Moldavia/elpepuint/20090413elpepiint_5/Tes "El ingreso de Rumania en la UE ha complicado las cosas en Moldavia"], ''El Pais'', 13 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic row with Romania==
The civil unrest in Moldova led to a diplomatic row with Romania, after President Voronin accused [[Romania]] of being the force behind the riots in Chişinău.&lt;ref name="declansat"&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/846596/Voronin-Romania-a-declansat-revolta-de-la-Chişinău/ "Voronin: România a declanşat revolta de la Chişinău"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Romania denied all charges of being involved in the protests.&lt;ref name="declansat"/&gt;

The [[Romanian ambassador in Moldova]], [[Filip Teodorescu]] was declared [[persona non grata]] by the Moldovan government, being required to leave the country within 24 hours.&lt;ref name="declansat"/&gt; The following day, the Romanian parliament nominated a senior diplomat, Mihnea Constantinescu, as the new ambassador to Moldova,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2009/04/09/nb-01 "Romania names new ambassador to neighbouring Moldova"], ''[[Southeast European Times]]'', 9 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; but two weeks later, the Moldovan government rejected him without any explanation, deepening the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hbPXrbaIVWh75rjj9GUNX_Q2ji_QD97OU6B80 "Dispute between Romania and Moldova worsens"], ''AP'', 24 April 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501063543/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hbPXrbaIVWh75rjj9GUNX_Q2ji_QD97OU6B80 |date=1 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanian government changed the regulations which allow foreigners who had ancestors who had Romanian citizenship (including most Moldovans) to gain the [[Romanian nationality law|Romanian citizenship]].

After the civil unrest, the climate in [[Moldova]] became very polarized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/30/world/europe/30moldova.html|title=A Polarized Moldova Votes, Mindful of West and Russia|date=30 July 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliament of the Republic of Moldova|parliament]] failed to [[Moldovan presidential election, May–June 2009|elect a new president]]. For this reason, the parliament was dissolved and [[Moldovan parliamentary election, July 2009|snap elections]] were held. The [[Moldovan parliamentary election, July 2009|29 July polls]] were won by the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|Communist Party]] with 44.7% of the vote. That gave the former ruling party 48 MPs, and the remaining 53 seats in the 101-member chamber went to four opposition parties. Opposition parties agreed to create the [[Alliance for European Integration]] that pushed the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|Communist party]] into opposition. The [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|Communists]] were in government since 2001.

The original [[Moldovan Declaration of Independence]] approved and signed on 27 August 1991 was burned during the civil unrest, but an identical document was restored in 2010.&lt;ref name="metroeireann"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metroeireann.com/article/moldova-restores-declaration-of,2554|website=metroeireann.com|title=Moldova restores Declaration of Independence|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azi.md/en/story/8658|title=Text of Moldova's Declaration of Independence recovered|publisher=|accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baligh is rarely mentioned in Mamluk chronicles.&lt;ref name="Bauden69"&gt;Bauden 2004, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; His surname "Tayyi" indicates that he was a member of the [[Tayy]]id tribe of Banu Rabi'ah, though it is not known if he belonged to the [[Al Fadl]] or Al Mira branch.&lt;ref name="Bauden70"&gt;Bauden 2004, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Banu Rabi'ah was the most dominant tribe in Mamluk Syria, the area around [[al-Karak]] was dominated by the [[Banu Uqba]].&lt;ref name="Bauden70"/&gt; During the power struggle following the death of Sultan [[an-Nasir Muhammad]] (r. 1310–1341), Baligh was one of the main backers of the sultan's al-Karak-based son, [[an-Nasir Ahmad, Sultan of Egypt|an-Nasir Ahmad]]. The Mamluk historian [[al-Maqrizi]] wrote that Baligh was Ahmad's "most important confidant among the people of al-Karak",&lt;ref name="Bauden68"&gt;Bauden 2004, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[Arab]] inhabitants were a well-spring of support for Ahmad.&lt;ref name="Bauden66-67"&gt;Bauden 2004, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad eventually gained the sultanate and moved the Mamluk throne from [[Cairo]] to al-Karak.&lt;ref name="Bauden66-67"/&gt; Baligh officially served as the ''muqaddam'' (commander) of the ''halqa'' (non-''[[mamluk]]'') regiment in al-Karak's fortress. The regiment consisted of [[Bedouin]] tribesmen and locals from the al-Sharat mountains.&lt;ref name="Bauden68"/&gt;

While Ahmad ruled from al-Karak, the Mamluks in Egypt had him replaced with his half-brother, [[as-Salih Ismail, Sultan of Egypt|as-Salih Ismail]].&lt;ref name="Bauden66-67"/&gt; Hoping to be rewarded for his loyalty, Baligh continued to support Ahmad during the numerous Mamluk campaigns against al-Karak.&lt;ref name="Bauden69"/&gt; On 30 August 1343, Baligh was wounded in the leg during one of the Mamluk expeditions against Ahmad.&lt;ref name="Bauden73"&gt;Bauden, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Ahmad's "wealth came to depletion", Baligh "began to work upon him", according to al-Maqrizi.&lt;ref name="Bauden69"/&gt; Baligh began communications with Ismail via the Mamluk emirs besieging al-Karak.&lt;ref name="Bauden69"/&gt; The latter could not be captured because of the resistance of Baligh's Arab troops throughout the vicinity.&lt;ref name="Bauden68"/&gt; Baligh promised Ismail he could arrange the surrender of al-Karak, writing &lt;blockquote&gt;All the people in the fortress of al-Karak are my friends and those in the city are my family and kinsfolk. No one among them contradicts me.&lt;ref name="Bauden68"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ismail accepted Baligh's offer, giving him a pardon, after which Baligh escaped al-Karak to meet Ismail in Cairo.&lt;ref name="Bauden69"/&gt; He arrived with a coterie of supporters on 21 March 1344,&lt;ref name="Bauden69"/&gt; and in return for his defection, was granted an ''[[iqta]]'' (fief) with an annual revenue of 450,000 silver [[dirham]]s and the title of ''amir tablkhana''.&lt;ref name="Bauden72"&gt;Bauden 2004, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Baligh left Cairo three days later and proceeded to facilitate the surrender of al-Karak and Ahmad to Ismail's troops on 5 July 1344.&lt;ref name="Bauden69"/&gt; In August, Baligh and a certain Isa ibn Hasan were arrested on charges of involvement in the murder of a camel merchant in Cairo named Hasan ibn al-Radini.&lt;ref name="Bauden73"/&gt; The ''na'ib'' of Cairo sought to punish them by [[bastinado]], but they managed to have the punishment delayed pending further investigation.&lt;ref name="Bauden72"&gt;Bauden 2004, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, they used their influence with some Mamluk emirs, who successfully lobbied for their release.&lt;ref name="Bauden72"/&gt; This was the final time Baligh was mentioned in Mamluk sources.&lt;ref name="Bauden73"/&gt;

[[File:The Committee on World Food Security (CFS) 2015 Logo.png|thumb|Logo of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) of the United Nations]]
The '''Committee on World Food Security''' (CFS) was established in 1974 as an intergovernmental body to serve as a forum in the [[United Nations System]] for review and follow-up of policies concerning world [[food security]] including production and physical and economic access to food.

The committee's tasks are to
* Coordinate a global approach to food security
* Promote policy convergence
* Support and advise countries and regions
* Coordinate at national and regional levels
* Promote accountability and share best practices
* Develop a global strategic framework for food security and nutrition

==Structure==
===The CFS Bureau and Advisory Group===

The Bureau is the executive arm of the CFS .  It is made up of a Chairperson and twelve member countries. The Advisory group is made up of representatives from the 5 different categories of CFS Participants.  These are:

1	UN agencies and other UN bodies;&lt;br /&gt;
2	Civil society and non-governmental organizations particularly organizations representing smallholder family farmers, fisherfolks, herders, landless, urban poor, agricultural and food workers, women, youth, consumers and indigenous people;&lt;br /&gt;
3	International agricultural research institutions;&lt;br /&gt;
4	International and regional financial institutions such as the [[World bank|World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], regional development banks and the [[Wto|World Trade Organization]];&lt;br /&gt;
5	Private sector associations and philanthropic foundations.

===Plenary===

The Plenary session is held annually and is the central body for decision-taking, debate, coordination, lesson-learning and convergence by all stakeholders at a global level on food security issues.

===The High Level Panel of Experts (HLPE)===

The High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition (HLPE) was established in 2010 as the science-policy interface of the UN Committee on World Food Security (CFS). The HLPE aims to improve the robustness of policy making by providing independent, evidence-based analysis and advice at the request of CFS. 

The HLPE has two components.  The first is a steering committee made up of internationally recognized experts in a variety of food security and nutrition-related fields.  The second is a roster of experts which is used to build teams that act on a project -specific basis to analyze and report on issues related to food security and nutrition.

The goal of the HLPE is to ensure the regular inclusion of advice based on scientific evidence and knowledge.  As directed by the CFS Plenary and Bureau, the HLPE will assess and analyze the current state of food security and nutrition and its underlying causes.  It will also provide scientific and knowledge-based analysis and advice on policy-relevant issues and identify emerging trends.  It will also help  prioritize future actions and focus attention on key focal areas.

Until today (2013) the HLPE has published 6 reports:
# Price volatility and food security (2011)
# Land tenure and international investments in agriculture (2011)
# Food security and climate change (2012)
# Social protection for food security (2012)
# Biofuels and food security (2013)
# Investing in smallholder agriculture for food security (2013)

===The Secretariat===

The CFS has a permanent Secretariat located in [[Fao|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)]] headquarters in Rome, Italy which includes members from the [[Wfp|World Food Programme (WFP)]] and the [[IFAD|International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)]].  Its task is to support the Plenary, the Bureau and Advisory Group and the HLPE in their work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23215">'''Counterpropaganda''' is a form of communication consisting of methods taken and messages relayed to oppose [[propaganda]] which seeks to influence [[Action (philosophy)|action]] or perspectives among a targeted [[audience]]. It is closely connected to propaganda as the two often employ the same methods to broadcast methods to a targeted audience. Counterpropaganda differs from propaganda as it is defensive and responsive to identified propaganda. Additionally, counterpropaganda consists of several elements that further distinguish it from propaganda and ensure its effectiveness in opposing propaganda messages.

==Definition==
Counterpropaganda and propaganda share a symbiotic relationship. Counterpropaganda is employed in situations to counter existing propaganda efforts and thus to understand the former requires a clear understanding of the latter. Practitioners and academics alike have advanced multiple definitions of propaganda. For the sake of clarity this article acknowledges the definition proposed by Garth Jowett and Victoria O'Donnell who define propaganda as " the deliberate, systematic attempt to shape perceptions, manipulate cognitions, and direct behavior to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist "&lt;ref name="Jowlett and O'Donnell"&gt;Garth Jowett and Victoria O'Donnell, ''Propaganda and Persuassion'', 4th ed. Sage Publications, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice propaganda consists of communicating a controlled message to a targeted audience. Similarly, counterpropaganda is used to communicate a message that describes the propaganda as false and instructs the target audience to think or act in a manner that counters the propaganda message. To be effective counterpropaganda must target the same audience as the original propaganda message and often may employ the same methods. However, counterpropaganda is unique on its reliance on factual messages, and its existence as a reactionary effort. Since counterpropaganda intends to counter previously stated propaganda messages it cannot be employed preemptively. Counterpropaganda is, however, based upon some of the same fundamentals of propaganda regarding targeting the salient elements that influences audiences.&lt;ref name="Jacques Ellul"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jacques Ellul|Ellul, Jacques]]|title=[[Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes]]|date=1973|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-394-71874-3|edition=Reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33–36}}

The existing definitions of counterpropaganda differ on their prescription of specified methods and intentions. To illustrate, [[Herbert Romerstein]], former Director of the Office to Counter Soviet [[Disinformation]] and [[Active measures|Active Measures]] at the [[United States Information Agency]], defined Counterpropaganda as "carefully prepared answers to false propaganda with the purpose of refuting the disinformation and undermining the propagandist."&lt;ref name="Herbert Romerstein"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Romerstein|first1=Herbert|title="Counterpropaganda: We Can’t Win Without It", in Strategic influence : public diplomacy, counterpropaganda, and political warfare|date=2009|publisher=Institute of World Politics Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0979223648|pages=137–180|url=http://jmw.typepad.com/files/strategicinfluenceclass_copy.pdf|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His definition defines the intentions of the counterpropaganda as first countering propaganda and then undermining the credibility of the propagandists. Romerstein's insights are likely influenced by his professional experience in countering Soviet propaganda which was broadcast toward the U.S. through a variety of means. In comparison, Colonel Garrison whose research focuses on the broadcast media as a method of propaganda and public diplomacy provides a more detailed definition of counterpropaganda. He defined counterpropaganda as the "actions to discredit an adversary's use of broadcast media to support their national objectives by influencing the opinions, emotions, attitude, or behavior of U.S. and friendly audiences."&lt;ref name="WC Garrison"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=W.C. Garrison |author2=Colonel, U.S. Army |title=Information Operations and Counter-propaganda: Making a Weapon of Public Affairs|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a363892.pdf|accessdate=3 December 2015|publisher=USAWC strategy research project, U.S. Army War College}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus in this definition is the actions to discredit the propagandists' use of broadcast media. The definition defines counterpropaganda by its usage of broadcast media and its intent to undermine the adversaries biased use of the same medium. The differences in the two demonstrate that counterpropaganda is likely to be defined upon its operational usage and the perspective the definer has toward propaganda. Together both definitions clearly illustrate the symbiotic relationship between propaganda and counterpropaganda. The definitions also demonstrate counterpropaganda, like propaganda, is generally described as a targeted form of communication intending to influence a specific audience. Counterpropaganda merely intends to influence a counter action or thought to a previously broadcast propaganda message or messages.

==Elements of counterpropaganda==
While counterpropaganda shares similar traits with propaganda it also consists of unique key elements which define its effective employment.

===Basis in truth===
While propaganda messages may not always be truthful, effective counterpropaganda generally only broadcasts the truth.&lt;ref name="Herbert Romerstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul Smith"&gt;Paul A. Smith Jr, ''On Political War,'', Washington, D.C.: National Defense University Press, 1989), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, counterpropaganda is commonly understood to be the "truthful, honest opposition" to an adversary's propaganda.&lt;ref name= "WC Garrison"/&gt; Counterpropaganda communicates truthful messages for moral and practical reasons. During the [[Cold War]], the United States' reputation for broadcasting the truth to refute Soviet propaganda resulted in the U.S. being viewed as a "truth teller" where as the [[Soviet Union]] had a reputation as a "lie teller."&lt;ref name="Herbert Romerstein"/&gt; Herbert Romerstein argues that using truth based counterpropaganda resulted in the U.S. being perceived as honest where as the Soviet Union's use of false statements discredited their messages.&lt;ref name="Herbert Romerstein"/&gt; This Cold War example demonstrates how a false message is discredited when the truth is revealed. In practice a counterpropaganda message that was intentionally or mistakenly false could be revealed to be as biased as the propaganda it sought to oppose. Thus, telling the truth strengthens the effectiveness of counterpropaganda and weakens the propaganda of those revealed to be liars. The use of [[Deception|false messages]] in counterpropaganda is not effective and fails to adequately refute the propaganda message. Revealing a counterpropaganda message as incorrect or intending to influence via a lie would also harm the broadcaster's reputation and reduce their ability to effectively counter propaganda messages in the future.

====World War II – The Nemmersdorf massacre====

Counterpropaganda based upon a false information is not effective in opposing propaganda messages. This premise is best illustrated by the U.S. failed attempts to counter Germany's claims of Soviet Union committed [[Nemmersdorf massacre|atrocities in Nemmersdorf]], Prussia. When Germany forced the Soviet Union out of the city in October 1944 they found twenty-four dead including twelve women, two teenage girls, a baby, six old men and three school children. Several of the women and teenagers were raped. The Nazi propaganda unit, titled Skorpion, launched a leaflet campaign and sent a letter to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]] to expose the Soviet Union's actions to its American allies. In response America also launched a leaflet campaign and published an article in the March 1, 1945, issue number 49 of its leaflet/newspaper Frontpost titled "Keine Rache" (No Revenge) which quoted Soviet denials of the wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="Frontpost"&gt;''Frontpost, Nachrichten für Deutsche Soldaten, Herausgeber: Die
Amerikanischen Truppen in Westeuropa,'' No. 1(March 1945), 3 in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008), 144-145.&lt;/ref&gt; The false messages in American counterpropaganda failed to effectively oppose [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|German propaganda]] and failed to change German's perspectives toward the Soviet Union. The counterpropaganda campaign also did little to enforce America's reputation for honesty among German soldiers. When revealed false counterpropaganda damages the reputation of the broadcaster and limits his/her ability to counter propaganda in the future.

===Clarity===
Counterpropaganda messages relying on words or concepts not universally understood fail to adequately communicate to the target audience and are ineffective in opposing propaganda. Using understandable words to clearly convey the counterpropaganda message is more likely to counter propaganda messages.

===="Unconditional surrender" in World War II====

The converse is equally true. The use of the phrase "unconditional surrender" in World War II is a prime example of the importance of clarity. The phrase conveyed scary images to the Germans and the Japanese. Some experts proposed that the phrase would cause greater resistance against the allies because the term was not clearly conveyed to the target audience. The confusion required the U.S. and Britain to explain the message which resulted in reducing its effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Herbert Romerstein"/&gt;

====Coalition messages in Iraq====

Andrew Garfield explained that the Coalition messages in [[Iraq]] routinely referred to insurgents as "anti-Iraqis" which caused ambiguity in the coalition's counterpropaganda messages. The phrase did not adequately coincide with the descriptions various Iraqi communities prescribed insurgents. As a result, the phrase failed to convey the message the Coalition sought to convey.&lt;ref name="Andrew Garfield"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garfield|first1=Andrew|title="Recovering the Lost Art of Counterpropaganda: An interim assessment of the war of ideas in Iraq", in Strategic influence : public diplomacy, counterpropaganda, and political warfare|date=2009|publisher=Institute of World Politics Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0979223648|pages=181–196|url=http://jmw.typepad.com/files/strategicinfluenceclass_copy.pdf|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counterpropaganda messages that require explanations for clarity fail to adequately communicate the intended message and thus fail to oppose propaganda.

===Knowledge of the audience===
Counterpropaganda, like propaganda, requires developing messages understanding of the [[target audience]] and the ability to tailor the message appropriately. Effective counterpropaganda relies on communicating messages that "resonate with the target audiences" and that are based on culturally relevant narratives. More precisely, developing messages that are effective in a target audience entails identifying the existing sentiments, stereotypes and opinions that influence the audience's perspectives, beliefs and actions.&lt;ref name="Jacques Ellul"/&gt;{{rp|34}}&lt;ref name="Andrew Garfield"/&gt; In considering these elements of a society, propaganda and counterpropaganda can influence a group toward a particular perspective or action.&lt;ref name="Jacques Ellul"/&gt;{{rp|34–36}} Since the objective of counterpropaganda is to influence an audience to reject a propaganda message, it must touch upon the elements of culture, belief and emotion that will result in such action. The elements will vary among audiences and while propaganda and counterpropaganda campaigns can and do utilize existing methods the messages must be tailored specifically to the individual target audience.

===Employed rapidly===
Counterpropaganda is a reactive method that must be employed rapidly to effectively contradict a propaganda message. [[Oliver Carlson]] explains that the longer propaganda is perceived as the truth the harder it is to contradict even when the target audience is exposed to an opposing true message.&lt;ref name="Oliver Carlson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlson|first1=Oliver|title=Handbook on propaganda for the alert citizen|journal=Studies of the Foundation for Social Research|volume=2|issue=1|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_on_propaganda_for_the_alert_cit.html?id=HwrTAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; A propaganda message that is not contradicted immediately upon its discovery is likely to become the basis the target audience's actions and beliefs.

Psychology provides additional reasons to rapidly employ counterpropaganda. The decision making process is influenced by [[cognitive biases]] which shape how a person perceives certain pieces of information and how they will act upon them. The [[confirmation bias]] is especially relevant when explaining the necessity of employing counterpropaganda rapidly. Confirmation bias is a tendency for people to favor information confirming their beliefs or hypotheses.&lt;ref name="Scott Plous"&gt;Scott Plous, ''The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making McGraw Hill, 1993, 233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science Daily"&gt;ScienceDaily. Confirmation Bias. https://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/c/confirmation_bias.htm(accessed 4/14/2012)&lt;/ref&gt; If a group based their beliefs or actions upon a propaganda message they were exposed to over or during a long period of time it is difficult to counter the propaganda. The group in such a scenario would be hesitant to assimilate any information from a counterpropaganda message that contradicted the propaganda message. Thus, it is important for counterpropaganda be employed early in a propaganda campaign to prevent the possibility of confirmation bias resulting from propaganda. In ''[[Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes]]'', [[Jacques Ellul]] suggests another reason to employ counterpropaganda quickly in response to an identified propaganda message. He argues that humankind is more concerned with current events and issues that hold the society's attention. Propaganda shaped upon current events will invoke the greatest amount of community passion and interest.&lt;ref name="Jacques Ellul"/&gt;{{rp|46, 49}} Countering propaganda, requires a quick response to propaganda when it is revealed. Conversely, employing counterpropaganda against a dated propaganda message that regards an equally dated issue that society holds no current interest is likely to be less effective.

==Methods of counterpropaganda==
Counterpropaganda intends to broadcast messages aimed at refuting and/or countering propaganda messages and thus many of the effective propaganda methods are equally effective in broadcasting counterpropaganda. However, counterpropaganda utilizes a few unique techniques that are effective in attacking propaganda's credibility and ability to influence a target audience.

===Research and analysis===
Effective counterpropaganda begins by fully collecting and analyzing the propaganda to be countered. The metaphor explaining this function is simple; to counter a propaganda message it is necessary to fully understand the message, its target audience and its objectives. Success in countering propaganda requires a "comprehensive propaganda monitoring and collection effort" that identifies and catalogues examples of all types of adversarial propaganda. This initial method of counterpropaganda benefits from experts in a range of disciplines to include intelligence psychological operations, social science, cultural anthropologists, etc. who are capable of analyzing the propaganda. Expert analysis can properly dissect the propaganda to provide answers to the following questions necessary to form an effective counterpropaganda effort:&lt;ref name="Andrew Garfield"/&gt; 
* Who is the intended audience?
* What effects do the propagandists desire?
* What effects have they achieved?
* Which other audiences have heard or seen this message?
* What do these messages indicate about an adversary's perceptions, capabilities, vulnerabilities, and intent?
* What are the intentional or unintentional inaccuracies, inconsistencies, or deceits in the messages that we can exploit?
* What counter arguments can we deploy, to whom, and how?

===Reveal true origin of propaganda===
Oliver Carlson explains in the Handbook of Propaganda: For the Alert Citizen that the "Best propaganda is that which does not disclose itself as propaganda." &lt;ref name="Oliver Carlson"/&gt;{{rp|105}} There are three types of propaganda which differ depending upon their attribution. White propaganda reveals its origin and generally classified as overt. Covert propaganda includes grey propaganda in which the source is not revealed and black propaganda in which a false origin is claimed (the episode at the 1984 Olympics described below is an example of "black propaganda").&lt;ref name="Alfred H. Paddock Jr."&gt;Alfred H. Paddock Jr., "Legitimizing Army Psychological Operations," ''Joint Forces Quarterly,'' Issue 56, 2010, 90, http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a515093.pdf (accessed April 15, 20120).&lt;/ref&gt; In the later two types of propaganda the message's origin is concealed in some way. Often the credibility of a propaganda message depends on masking the true origin of the message to ensure the audience accepts it as an unbiased communication. Often propagandists will create a persona that is "reliable, trustworthy and credible" to the target audience which increases the likelihood that the message is believed and influences the audience's actions and perspectives.&lt;ref name="George Mason University"&gt;''Propaganda,''{{cite web |url=https://mason.gmu.edu/~amcdonal/Purpose%20of%20Propaganda.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430161238/http://mason.gmu.edu/~amcdonal/Purpose%20of%20Propaganda.html |archivedate=2012-04-30 |df= }} (Accessed April 8, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; When counterpropaganda reveals the propaganda's true origin the target audience quickly loses faith in the message as the propagandist was caught lying.&lt;ref name="George Mason University"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anthony Rhodes"&gt;Anthony Rhodes, ''Propaganda: The Art of Persuasion World War II,''(New York:Chelsea House Publications, 1976), 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The 1984 Los Angeles Olympics====

During the months leading up to the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] hosted by Los Angeles, the Soviet Union circulated forged Ku Klux Klan leaflets threatening the lives of non-white athletes. The Soviet Union sent the leaflets specifically to the African and Asian Olympic Committees. The U.S. State Department released a public statement accusing the KGB of producing the leaflets and notified each Olympic committee that the leaflets were forgeries. The result was no single Olympic committee refused to attend the games and the Soviets were revealed as the origin of the propaganda.&lt;ref name="Herbert Romerstein"/&gt;

===Expose reasoning errors===
Propagandists exploit [[cognitive biases]] and other elements of decision making to shape their messages to influence the target audience. In this sense they are able to insert a propaganda message into a target audience's logic to make that message more believable and credible. Specifically, propagandists deliberately use errors in arguments to appeal to the emotions of their audience.&lt;ref name="George Mason University"/&gt; When a counterpropaganda campaign exposes the target audience's errors in judgment and resolves them the propaganda message loses strength. This counterpropaganda method works similarly as reveal the true origin of a propaganda message as it exposes the broadcaster as a liar which reduces its credibility. Furthermore, when made aware of logical fallacies in its reasoning, the target audience will soon reject any message that was based on this faulty reasoning. 
A competing perspective suggests that propaganda is based upon emotional reactions not cognitive reasoning. Carlson argues propaganda is developed as much as possible to focus on people's emotions versus their rational.&lt;ref name="Oliver Carlson"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}} This argument suggests propaganda is minimally based upon reasoning and logic and that exposing a group's logical errors is ineffective in refuting propaganda messages.&lt;ref name="Philip M. Taylor"&gt;Philip M. Taylor,''Munitions of the Mind: A History of Propaganda from the Ancient World to the Present Day, (Manchester and New York:Manchester University Press, 1995),15.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Jacques Ellul presents another basis for propaganda which suggests exposing a group's faulty reasoning is not an effective method to oppose propaganda. He argues that the speed at which events occur, become out dated and no longer of interest cause mankind to have little patience for using attention and awareness to closely examine current events. The individual is interested only in the superficial element of particular events, which is one reason propaganda is effective.&lt;ref name="Jacques Ellul"/&gt;{{rp|47}} It is, therefore, difficult to draw an audience's attention to the minutiae necessary to highlight flaws in their reasoning which make a propaganda message effective. Yet, Ellul further elaborates that this counterpropaganda message is critical to instruct a group to defend itself against propaganda as it exposes an audience's vulnerability to propaganda based upon our own mental vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name="Jacques Ellul"/&gt;{{rp|257}}

===Dissemination of exposed propaganda===
Effective propaganda is tailored to a particular audience and when it is shared to another group the message is clearly revealed as an influencing message. Some audiences are more sophisticated and techniques that work on comparably less developed nations will be ineffective with the former. When a counterpropaganda campaign shares propaganda intended for a specific audience with another audience the propagandists' true intentions are revealed. The sharing of propaganda messages between audiences also enables the second audience to reveal propaganda messages targeting them. In the 1980s, during the Cold War, the United States shared examples of Soviet disinformation targeting the Third World with European nations. The Europeans were then able to identify Soviet propaganda targeting them. The sharing of propaganda damaged the Soviet Union's reputation in Europe during a time it sought Western approval.&lt;ref name="Herbert Romerstein"/&gt; Thus, countering propaganda by demonstrating it to be outright lies, or intending to influence reduces its effectiveness across target audiences.

'''Darren T. Kimura''' (born September 10, 1974, [[Hilo, Hawaii]]) is an American businessman, inventor, and investor.  He is best known as the inventor of Micro [[Concentrated solar power]] (CSP) technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Niche Markets for micro-CSP Page|url=http://social.csptoday.com/emerging-markets/niche-markets-micro-csp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MicroCSP - Concentrating Solar Power|url=http://www.altenergymag.com/emagazine/2011/10/microcsp-concentrated-solar-power/1804}}&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise known as MicroCSP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Patent and Trademark Office Trademark MicroCSP|url=http://trade.mar.cx/US77241333/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Kimura was born to [[Japanese American]] parents in [[Hilo, Hawaii]] and graduated from [[Waiakea High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Darren T. Kimura Class of 1992|url=http://waiakeahigh.k12.hi.us/library/NaMea%20Pages/Darren%20Kimura.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He achieved the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] as a member in the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. He studied Computer Science and Business Management at the [[University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa]].  He later attended [[Portland State University]], studying Electrical Engineering and [[Stanford University]] studying Computer Science.  During the 2009 flu pandemic, ''[[Newsweek]]'' covered Darren’s challenges in finding [[Tamiflu]] for his wife Kelly due to hoarding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Newsweek: Why individual stockpiling of anti-flu medication is a bad idea|url=http://mag.newsweek.com/2009/04/30/healthy-hoarders.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Kimura began his career as an entrepreneur bringing the sport of [[paintball]] to Hawaii while still in high school.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} When attending the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] he worked in the Information and Computer Sciences department, where he launched Nalu Communications, an [[internet service provider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saipan Tribune Rountable|url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=60624&amp;cat=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later he created and expanded Energy Industries Corporation.  With the support of Energy Industries he created Energy Laboratories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Laboratories|url=http://www.energylaboratories.com/?page_id=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an incubator for start-up companies, and Enerdigm Ventures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enerdigm Ventures|url=http://enerdigm.com/wp/}}&lt;/ref&gt; a venture capital firm to seed and support early to growth stage companies. MicroCSP Technology and [[Sopogy]], Inc. began as a spin-off of at Energy Laboratories and was initially funded by Kimura and Enerdigm Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sopogy closes Series E funding |url=http://www.altassets.net/private-equity-news/by-news-type/deal-news/us-solar-developer-sopogy-closes-series-e-funding-round.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kimura and Enerdigm Ventures invested in the creation of [[LiveAction]] as a spin-out from Referentia a government contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2014/02/11/darren-kimura-named-ceo-of-live-action.html|title=Darren Kimura named CEO of Live Action - Pacific Business News|website=bizjournals.com|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also supported the construction of the world’s first MicroCSP project, called [[Holaniku at Keahole Point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sopogy inaugurates the World’s first MicroCSP solar thermal plant using Sopogy’s products |url=http://sopogy.com/blog/2009/12/10/sopogy-inaugurates-the-world%E2%80%99s-first-microcsp%E2%84%A2-solar-thermal-plant/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sopogy introduces new solar technology at NELHA |url=http://www.hawaii247.com/2009/12/11/sopogy-introduces-new-solar-technology-at-nelha/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as a director to the State of Hawaii Venture Capital fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HSDC Annual Report|url=http://lrbhawaii.info/reports/legrpts/dbedt/hsdc/211f_15hrs_11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His entrepreneurial accomplishments has led him to be featured on the cover of ''[[MidWeek]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Midweek: The future’s so bright|url=http://archives.midweek.com/content/story/midweek_coverstory/Darren_Kimura_Energy_Conservation_and_Management_Hawaii_/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the cover of ''Pacific Edge'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pacific Edge: The Energy Within |url=http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/b9bdde2b#/b9bdde2b/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entrepreneur Magazine: Riding the Green Wave |url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/196570}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 2007 book ''The Greater Good: Life Lessons from Hawaii's Leaders''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Greater Good: Crazy to Visionary |url=http://www.greatergoodbooks.com/The_Greater_Good-sneak_peek.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a live guest with [[Al Gore]] on [[The Climate Reality Project]] on ''[[24 Hours of Reality|24 Hours of Reality – The Dirty Weather Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Oceans &amp; Hawaii|url=http://climaterealityproject.org/24hours2012/live-broadcast/hour-06-the-worlds-oceans/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was featured in the [[Hawaiian Electric Company]]'s [[clean energy]] promotion, which was highlighted during the [[APEC United States 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hawaiian Electric Green Energy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCGM5y07TNU&amp;feature=youtu.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy Industries Corporation ===
Kimura started Energy Conservation Hawaii in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future’s So Bright…|url=http://archives.midweek.com/content/story/midweek_coverstory/Darren_Kimura_Energy_Conservation_and_Management_Hawaii_/}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the back of his [[SUV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Success built on CEO’s work ethic|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2006/Nov/08/bz/FP611080319.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; using his surfboard as his desk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From surfer to renewable energy entrepreneur|url=http://www.bizgym.com/2009/08/green-success-story-daren-kimura-trades-in-his-surfboard-for-a-thriving-renewable-energy-business/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few years the company reached $50 million in revenues and began national expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Success build on CEO’s work ethic |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2006/Nov/08/bz/FP611080319.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kimura changed the company name to Energy Industries Corporation to appeal to its national markets, and he remains the largest shareholder.  The underlying concept for creating Energy Industries Corporation was to help make energy efficiency simple.  In his work at Energy Industries Corporation, Kimura provided [[Energy Star]] consulting services in such locations as Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hawaii Business: Energy Savers|url=http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/May-2001/Light-Savers/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palau,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Star in Palau|url=http://darrentkimura.com/2006/01/27/energy-star-in-palau/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Star in Guam |url=http://darrentkimura.com/2006/01/25/energy-star-in-guam/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Saipan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Division sponsors energy-saving workshop |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&amp;newsID=60711}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy Industries Corporation was featured in the 2008 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article "Alternative State", about renewable energy projects created in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wall Street Journal Alternative State|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121432274606000209 | work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MicroCSP ===
{{Main|Solar thermal energy#MicroCSP}}
The concept for MicroCSP technologies were created when Kimura attempted to install a conventional Concentrating Solar Power trough in Kona, Hawaii.  Realizing that it was uneconomical and not practical to ship, install and operate such large components in remote locations like Hawaii, Kimura worked on reducing the dimensions of the solar collector which led to reconfiguring the technology and incorporating the use of state of the art materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MicroCSP Beginnings |url=http://www.altenerg.com/back_issues/index.php-content_id=409.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;   MicroCSP is used for community-sized power plants (1 MW to 50 MW), for industrial, agricultural and manufacturing 'process heat' applications, and when large amounts of hot water are needed, such as resort swimming pools, water parks, large laundry facilities, sterilization, distillation and other such uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= MicroCSP Uses|url=http://www.estif.org/fileadmin/estif/content/policies/downloads/D23-solar-industrial-process-heat.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MIT also studied the use of MicroCSP technology in power generation using the Organic Rankine Cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MicroCSP Beginnings |url=http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/88278}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kimura trademarked the term MicroCSP &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MicroCSP Trademark |url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4801:m8l02j.2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later released the term for use in the public domain to help accelerate MicroCSP adoption.  His [[US]] [[Patent]] on the idea ({{US patent|20080127967}}) served as the basis for other MicroCSP inventions.  Companies producing MicroCSP technologies include [[Rackam]], [[GlassPoint Solar]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CSP Today Glasspoint Solar markets |url=http://social.csptoday.com/markets/micro-csp-still-looking-good-sopogy%E2%80%99s-wake}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abengoa Solar &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abengoa Solar for Industrial Applications website |url= http://www.abengoasolar.com/web/en/nuestros_productos/aplicaciones_industriales/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aora &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aora cuts blue ribbon |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2012/02/09/aora-cuts-blue-ribbon-on-europes-first-hybrid-micro-csp-demonstration/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sun2Power&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sun2Power|url=http://www.kcorc.org/en/rd-projects/sun2power-micro-solar-csp-plant/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromasun &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chromasun |url=http://chromasun.com/images/content/presentations/SPI2011%20Chromasun%20Peter%20Le%20Lievre.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; SolarLite &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SolarLite|url=http://solarlite-csp.com/en/power_plants.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sopogy ===
{{Main|Sopogy}}
Sopogy, a solar thermal technology supplier, was founded in 2002 at the Honolulu, Hawaii–based clean technology incubator known as Energy Laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sopogy Website|url=http://sopogy.com/company/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began its research on concentrating solar thermal energy to produce solar steam and thermal heat for absorption chillers or industrial process heat. The company has also developed applications that incorporate its solar collectors to generate electricity and desalination. Kimura created the company name from taking sections of key words including "SO" from Solar, "PO" from "Power", and "GY" from "Energy and Technology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=About Sopogy  |url=http://sopogy.com/about/index.php?id=16#3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's [[OEM]] and [[Independent Power Producer|IPP]] sales teams are located in [[Honolulu]] along with its [[research and development]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sopogy returns to Manoa Innovation Center|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/blog/2013/06/sopogy-inc-returns-to-original-office.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006 it expanded its manufacturing, [[C&amp;I]], and [[oil and gas]] sales teams in its [[Silicon Valley]] facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hawaii tech firms move offices and expand facilities to Mainland|url=http://sopogy.com/blog/2007/12/28/hawaii-tech-firms-move-offices-and-expand-facilities-to-mainland/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sopogy has installed 200 megawatts in China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sopogy announced the installation of 200 megawatts of CSP in China|url=http://www.helioscsp.com/noticia.php?id_not=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sopogy Lands 200MW China Project for Thermal Storage |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/blog/post/2010/12/sopogy-lands-200mw-china-project-for-thermal-energy-storage}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 360 megawatts in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sopogy signs agreement on Thai solar project|url=http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/view/19449/sopogy-signs-agreement-on-thai-solar-project/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kimura and Sopogy, along with [[First Solar]], were featured in the [[Whole Foods Market]] documentary ''Thrive''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whole Foods features Sopogy and First Solar |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDNavtgu9yc&amp;feature=youtu.be }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Sopogy was honored with the [[APEC]] Business Innovation Award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sopogy is APEC Honolulu technology showcase winner|url=http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/blog/2011/november/apec-business-spotlight-sopogy-apec-honolulu-technology-sho}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was featured on the cover of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Darren Kimura, CEO of Sopogy, at the firm's solar facility on Hawaii's Big Island|url=http://www.latimes.com/lat-fi-green-haw_kw5gonc,0,2184478.photo#axzz2oPmanlY1 | work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dhofar Liberation Front''' (DLF) ({{lang-ar|جبهة تحرير ظفار}}) was a [[communist]] front which was established to create a separatist state in [[Dhofar]], the southern province of [[Oman]], which shared a border with [[South Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=UK|first1=National Archives|title=FCO 51/41 Dhofar Liberation Front|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C6081348|website=discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
The JMA has two EEW systems: one for the general public and another for the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/en/NMHS/indexe_nmhs.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JMA-schemes(ja)"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seisvol.kishou.go.jp/eq/EEW/kaisetsu/eew_naiyou.html|script-title=ja:緊急地震速報について｜緊急地震速報の内容|date=|accessdate=2008-06-29|publisher=[[Japan Meteorological Agency]]|language=ja|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312083958/http://www.seisvol.kishou.go.jp/eq/EEW/kaisetsu/eew_naiyou.html|archivedate=12 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a [[P-wave]] is detected from two (or more) of the 4,235 [[seismometer]]s installed throughout Japan, the JMA analyzes and predicts the approximate location of the earthquake's [[epicenter]]. This allows the JMA to notify people in affected [[prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] by TV and radio if a strong earthquake is expected.&lt;ref name="JMA-schemes(ja)"/&gt;

An Earthquake Early Warning is issued to warn the general public when an earthquake of 5 or higher on the [[Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale|Japan seismic scale]] is expected.&lt;ref name=aboutEEW-JMA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seisvol.kishou.go.jp/eq/EEW/kaisetsu/eew_naiyou.html|script-title=ja:緊急地震速報のしくみと予報・警報|publisher=[[Japan Meteorological Agency|JMA]]|location=Tokyo|language=ja|trans-title=About EEW alert and forecast|accessdate=2011-04-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312083958/http://www.seisvol.kishou.go.jp/eq/EEW/kaisetsu/eew_naiyou.html|archivedate=12 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An EEW forecast (緊急地震速報(予報)) is issued to the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services when an earthquake of 3 or higher on the Japan seismic scale (or 3.5 or higher on the [[Richter magnitude scale]]) is expected, or when the [[amplitude]] of P- or [[S-wave]]s measures more than 100 [[Gal (unit)|gals]].&lt;ref name=aboutEEW-JMA/&gt;

The system was developed to minimize earthquake damage and enable people to take shelter or evacuate dangerous areas before the arrival of its strong surface waves. It is used by railways to slow trains and by factories to halt assembly lines before the earthquake hits.&lt;ref name="JMA-outline(en)"/&gt;

The effectiveness of the warning depends on the position of the receiver. After receiving a warning, a person has from a few seconds to a minute or more to take action. Areas near an epicenter may experience strong tremors before a warning is issued.&lt;ref name="JMA-outline(ja)"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seisvol.kishou.go.jp/eq/EEW/kaisetsu/Whats_EEW.html|script-title=ja:緊急地震速報とは|date=|accessdate=2008-06-29|publisher=[[Japan Meteorological Agency]]|language=ja|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701195137/http://www.seisvol.kishou.go.jp/eq/EEW/kaisetsu/Whats_EEW.html|archivedate=1 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], the EEW system and Japan's [[tsunami warning system]] were considered effective. Although the tsunami killed over 10,000 people, it is believed that the casualties would have been much higher without the EEW system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Early warning system saved Japan worst of tsunami wrath|author=Amitabh Sinha|newspaper=[[Indian Express]]|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/early-warning-system-saved-japan-worst-of-tsunami-wrath/761448/|date=2011-03-12|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, the [[Chile]]an Subsecretary of Telecommunications said that their country hoped to establish a similar early-warning system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nextvnews.com/the-japanese-earthquake-pushed-isdb-t-alert-system-in-chile/|title=The Japanese earthquake pushed ISDB-T alert system in Chile|date=2011-04-01|publisher=NexTV Latam, TV Telco Latam|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Hit rate}}Hit rate==
The JMA announced the Earthquake Early Warning hit (accuracy) rate for the 2011 [[fiscal year#Japan|fiscal year]] on 31 May 2012. The hit rate is the percentage of warnings issued immediately on the detection of [[P-wave]]s with a {{nihongo|[[Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale]]|震度|shindo}} number (0 to 7) within one shindo number of the measured earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/kishou/hyouka/hyouka-report/24report/24shiryo.pdf|script-title=ja:平成24年報道発表資料|date=2012-05-31|publisher=[[Japan Meteorological Agency|JMA]]|location=Tokyo|page=25/147 sheet, page 2–15|language=ja|trans-title=Fiscal year 2012 (Heisei 24) press release, ''Material No.2 FY 2011 (Heisei 23) task review report''|format=PDF|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=November 2018|reason=This needs further explanation.}}

For the fiscal years 2007–2009, the hit rate was 75 percent or higher (75 percent in 2007, 82 percent in 2008 and 76 percent in 2009). The 2010 hit rate fell to 28 percent, due to the number of [[aftershock]]s following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake (which occurred near the end of the 2010 fiscal year); before the earthquake, the hit rate was 72 percent. Measurement techniques have since been refined to ignore minor earthquakes, and the hit rate for FY2011 increased to 56 percent. The JMA intended to increase the hit rate to over 85 percent by FY2015.

==={{anchor|False alarms}}Inaccuracies===
Although EEW accuracy has been increasing, the following erroneous alarms have been issued:
*March 11, 2011 - The earthquake warning for the Tohoku region underestimated the quake's intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.data.jma.go.jp/svd/eew/data/nc/oshirase/20110311.pdf|script-title=ja:東北地方を中心とした地域で発生する地震に係る緊急地震速報（予報及び警報）の発表について|trans-title=On the announcement of the emergency earthquake warning (forecast and alarm) related to the earthquake occurring in the area mainly in the Tohoku region|publisher=Japan Meteorological Agency|language=ja|date=2011-03-11|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2018}}
*August 8, 2013 - Although an emergency earthquake bulletin was announced at 16:56 JST from Kanto to Kyushu, no shaking was observed. Noise from the ocean-floor seismograph off southeastern [[Mie Prefecture]] was recorded at the same time as shaking from a [[Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale#Scale explanation|magnitude 2.3]] earthquake in northern [[Wakayama Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/press/1308/08b/0808_wakayama_eew.htm|script-title=ja:8月8日16時56分頃の和歌山県北部を震源とする地震に関する緊急地震速報について|publisher=Japan Meteorological Agency|language=ja|date=2013-08-08|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*January 5, 2018 - An 11:02 JST earthquake warning for the [[Kantō region]] and [[Fukushima Prefecture]] was an overestimation, caused by assessing concurrent earthquakes in [[Toyama Prefecture]] (magnitude 3.9) and [[Ibaraki Prefecture]] (magnitude 4.4) as a single quake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/press/1801/05a/20180105eew.pdf|script-title=ja:平成30年1月5日11時02分頃に発表した緊急地震速報（警報）について|publisher=Japan Meteorological Agency|language=ja|date=2018-01-05|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Technical improvement}}Improvements===
Technical improvements are being made to increase the hit rate, including the Integrated Particle Filter (IPF) and Propagation of Local Undamped Motion (PLUM) methods. The IPF method, introduced on December 14, 2016, obtains seismic source elements with a [[particle filter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/press/1612/13a/EEW_kaizen_201612.pdf|script-title=ja:緊急地震速報の技術的な改善（IPF法）等について|trans-title=Technical Improvement of Earthquake Early Warning (IPF Method) etc.|publisher=Japan Meteorological Agency|language=ja |date= 2016-12-13 |accessdate= 2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/press/1612/13a/EEW_kaizen_201612_IPF.pdf |script-title= ja:同時に複数の地震が発生した場合の緊急地震速報の技術的な改善についてーIPF法の運用開始ー |publisher= Japan Meteorological Agency |language=ja |date= 2016-12-13 |accessdate= 2018-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PLUM method, introduced on March 22, 2018, predicting the seismic intensity directly from observed intensity without estimating the [[hypocenter]] and scale.

=={{anchor|Format of EEW broadcasts}}Broadcast format==
===Television===
On [[NHK]] television channels and other Japanese TV broadcasters ([[ISDB]], including [[1seg]]),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg-yn_sGT90 8 Japanese Channels broadcasting the EEW simultaneously.]&lt;/ref&gt; an alert is a message window on the screen with the earthquake epicenter and areas affected by strong tremors. Two sets of chimes sound, followed by a voice announcement in Japanese: {{Nihongo|"This is an Earthquake Early Warning. Please prepare for powerful tremors."|「緊急地震速報です。強い揺れに警戒して下さい。」|Kinkyū Jishin Sokuhō desu. Tsuyoi yure ni keikai shite kudasai.}} In addition to NHK, the announcement is used by [[Fuji TV]], [[TV Asahi]] and [[Tokyo MX]]. [[Nippon TV]] and [[TBS Television|TBS]] shorten it to ''"Kinkyū Jishin Sokuhō desu"'' ("This is an Earthquake Early Warning"). [[TV Tokyo]] sounds a set of chimes, without a voice announcement.

The alerts also inform viewers of possible [[landslide]]s or a [[tsunami]] caused by the quake in the affected area. If [[tsunami warning]]s are issued, the system utilizes [[1seg]] to automatically turn on (and tune to NHK) all radios and televisions with [[1seg]] technology in at-risk areas. In addition to Japanese, the warnings are broadcast in English, Mandarin, Korean and Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[https://youtube.com/watch?v=qMNu8Y1jIlU&amp;t=3m39s Tsunami Warning in multiple languages.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Mobile phone networks}}Mobile-phone networks===
Japan's three major mobile phone carriers—[[NTT docomo]], [[au (mobile phone company)|au]] ([[KDDI]] and Okinawa Cellular) and [[SoftBank Mobile]]—have developed [[Cell Broadcast]] systems to send multiple users an SMS of the EEW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/info/news_release/page/070530_02.html|script-title=ja:緊急地震速報に対応した一斉同報配信基盤を開発|publisher=NTT DoCoMo|date=2007-05-30|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kddi.com/corporate/news_release/2007/0530c/index.html|script-title=ja:緊急地震速報に対応した一斉同報配信基盤を開発|publisher=KDDI|date=2007-05-30|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.softbank.jp/corp/group/sbm/news/press/2007/20070530_02/|script-title=ja:「緊急地震速報」について|publisher=SoftBank Mobile|date=2007-05-30|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is mandatory for 3G cell phones sold after 2007 to receive this service, although foreign manufacturers such as Nokia, Apple, HTC, LG and Samsung are exempt. In August 2011, Apple announced that its iOS 5 iPhone platform would support EEW notification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9to5mac.com/2011/08/21/ios-5-includes-early-earthquake-warning-notifications-for-japanese-iphone-users/|title=iOS 5 includes early earthquake warning notifications for Japanese iPhone users|date=2011-08-21|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NTT docomo====
EEW is enabled by default on all models of the {{nihongo|[[FOMA]] 905i series|[[:ja:FOMA#905iシリーズ|FOMA 905iシリーズ]]}} released after November 26, 2007, and on some FOMA high-speed models in the {{nihongo|FOMA 705i series|[[:ja:FOMA#705iシリーズ|FOMA 705iシリーズ]]}} released after February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/NEWS/20071002/283581/][[CEATEC]]&lt;span&gt; ドコモの905i、緊急地震速報を無償で受信可能に&lt;/span&gt;（Nikkei ITPro 2 October 2007）&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/service/areamail/index.html|script-title=ja:緊急速報「エリアメール」|trans-title=Emergency bulletin "area mail"|publisher=NTT DoCoMo|language=ja|date=2007-05-30|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====au====
The system was enabled on all models in early 2008, including [[:ja:W61CA|W61CA]], [[:ja:W61H|W61H]], [[:ja:W61K|W61K]], [[:ja:W61SA|W61SA]], [[:ja:W61SH|W61SH]], [[:ja:W62SA|W62SA]] and a few [[smartphone]] models, such as [[:ja:IS02|IS02]] (TSI01). KDDI and Okinawa Cellular began free EEW broadcasts via au's [[Short Message Service|SMS]], {{nihongo|[[C-mail]]|[[:ja:Cメール]]}}, on March 25, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kddi.com/corporate/news_release/2008/0324/index.html|script-title=ja:緊急地震速報の提供開始について|publisher=[[KDDI Corporation]]|language=ja|date=2008-03-24|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====SoftBank Mobile====
On May 30, 2007, [[SoftBank]] announced development of an EEW broadcast system similar to NTT docomo's and au's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadband.mb.softbank.jp/corporate/release/pdf/20070530_2j.pdf|script-title=ja:「緊急地震速報」について|trans-title=About "Earthquake Early Warning"|publisher=[[SoftBank]]|date=2007-05-30}}{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722124624/http://broadband.mb.softbank.jp/corporate/release/pdf/20070530_2j.pdf|date=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deployment of the system was originally planned for FY2008, but was postponed for two years. On August 25, 2010, EEW service began on [[Shikoku]], in the [[Kansai region|Kansai]], [[Tōkai region|Tōkai]], [[Tōhoku region|Tōhoku]] (seven prefectures) and [[Chūgoku region]]s, and portions of the [[Kantō region]]. The EEW broadcast network has covered the whole country since December 7, 2010. The [[:ja:SoftBank 831N|SoftBank 831N]] was the only model supporting EEW in March 2011, although more models had been expected to support the system after summer 2010.

====Other====
RC Solution Company developed Yurekuru Call for iPhone, a free [[iPhone]] application to receive EEW which is distributed on the Apple [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]; the application is also available for Android. Notification of an EEW might be delayed or blocked if communication lines are congested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcsc.co.jp/yurekuru-c21q4|script-title=ja:ゆれくるコール"for iPhone サポートサイト|publisher=RC Solution Co.|date=2011-03-14|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ascii.jp/elem/000/000/028/28965/|script-title=ja:あと何秒で地震が来るか分かるiPhoneアプリに惚れた！|publisher=Weekly ASCII PLUS|date=2010-11-30|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese version of [[iOS 5]] for iPhone has built-in EEW functionality.

[[File:Earthquake Early Warning FM Radio EAQ-001.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Two views of a white plastic radio|[[Iris Ohyama]] EQA-001 FM EEW radio, front ''(upper)'' and rear views]]
A specific, common [[Chime (bell instrument)|chime]] tone from [[Frequency modulation|FM]] stations is automatically detected and turns on the radio (if in [[sleep mode]]), sounding a loud chime and broadcasting an EEW message before the quake begins by detecting [[Seismic wave|S-waves]]. When the S-wave has been analyzed, detailed information on the earthquake (such as [[seismic scale]] and areas under threat) is announced.

The following radios receive EEWs from radio stations and are free of information or connection fees:

The EEW application can be configured to receive information on earthquakes with a JMA magnitude of 3.5 or higher or with a seismic intensity of 3 or higher. Newer versions of the program allow for the announcement of lower-intensity earthquakes. The program announces the approximate location of the epicenter, the expected JMA seismic intensity and displays a countdown to expected major shaking.

{{nihongo|ANET|[[:ja:ANET|ANET]]|アネット}}, a disaster-prevention technology company which is part of the [[Railway Technical Research Institute]] Group, released an application (EQMessenger) to receive ANET Alert on July 7, 2008.

Each of the five regions sends 40 deputies, which are selected according to party lists in the regions.

The electoral regions are divided to ensure a roughly equal distribution of population among the regions and may be modified by the [[National Electoral Institute]]. The current distribution has been in use since September 30, 2005.

[[File:Fahne tagebau.jpg|thumb|]]

'''Ende Gelände 2016''' was a large [[civil disobedience]] [[protest]] movement in Germany to [[Climate change mitigation|limit]] [[global warming]] through [[fossil fuel phase-out]].

3,500–4,000 [[environmental activist]]s from twelve countries blocked the Welzow-Süd [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]] [[Coal mining|coal mine]] and the coal-fired [[Schwarze Pumpe power station]], then owned by [[Vattenfall]] ([[Spremberg]]), from 13 to 15 May 2016.&lt;ref name=Release&gt;[https://www.ende-gelaende.org/en/press-release/press-release-15-may-2016/ Mass action blocking German lignite mining finishes after 48 hours], press release of Ende Gelände, 15 May 2016 (page visited on 28 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==

On 15 August 2015, in the first year of Ende Gelände, 1,500 activists blocked the [[Garzweiler surface mine]] owned by [[RWE]] (Ende Gelände 2015).&lt;ref&gt;John Jordan, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/27/europes-biggest-polluter-protesters-lignite-mine-germany-direct-action "The day we stopped Europe's biggest polluter in its tracks"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Thursday 27 August 2015 (page visited in 28 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://350.org/ende-gelande-wrap-up/ Ende Gelände 2015], [[350.org]] (page visited in 28 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ende Gelände formed in 2015 as a coalition of German environmental groups and "people from the anti-nuclear and anti-coal movements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ende-gelaende.org/de/ueber-uns/ |title=about us – Ende Gelände |work=www.ende-gelaende.org |access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The activists of the first Ende Gelände 2015 were hosted by the [[Climate Camp|climate camp]] "Rheinlandcamp". In 2016 the "Lausitzcamp" hosted the 3500 to 4000 activists and provided infrastructure and support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lausitzcamp.info/pressemitteilung-vom-18-05-2016-groesstes-lausitzcamp-aller-zeiten-war-voller-erfolg/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910042159/https://www.lausitzcamp.info/pressemitteilung-vom-18-05-2016-groesstes-lausitzcamp-aller-zeiten-war-voller-erfolg/ |archivedate=2016-09-10 |df= }} Press Release Lausitzcamp, May 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In German, ''Ende Gelände'' means "Here and no further".&lt;ref name=Milman&gt;Oliver Milman, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/16/break-free-protest-fossil-fuel "'Break Free' fossil fuel protests deemed 'largest ever' global disobedience"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Monday 16 May 2016 (page visited in 28 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Ende Gelände 2016 was part of an international wave of actions called "Break Free from Fossil Fuels".&lt;ref&gt;[https://breakfree2016.org/ Break Free from Fossil Fuels] (page visited in 28 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Mathilde Gracia, [http://www.lemonde.fr/energies/article/2016/05/13/mobilisation-internationale-contre-les-energies-fossiles_4919060_1653054.html "Mobilisation internationale contre les énergies fossiles"], ''[[Le monde]]'', 13 May 2016 (page visited in 28 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

It was followed by [[Ende Gelände 2017]]: in the [[Rhineland]] open-pit mines  on 24-29 August 2017 as well as 3-5 November 2017 on (for the [[2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference]]).

== Description ==

During the 48 hours of mass action, the coal-fired [[Schwarze Pumpe power station]] (described as "Europe's tenth largest emitter of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;") was cut to 20 percent of its power for two days.&lt;ref name=Release/&gt;

The nearly shutting down of the power plant over the weekend of Ende Gelände was seen by activists as a great success.&lt;ref name=Milman/&gt; Vattenfall Europe´s chairman of the board said: "It is an absolute new quality, that a power plant shall be forced to cease its work by violent pressure, which has direct consequences for the German electricity grid. This does not any more only affect Lusatia."&lt;ref name="MDR1"&gt;[http://www.mdr.de/sachsen/protest-braunkohle-lausitz-100_zc-ecc53a13_zs-570f6b3d.html ''Schwarze Pumpe weiterhin blockiert'']. MDR.de, 15. Mai 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The short term goal of Ende Gelände was to stop the process of Vattenfall selling the mining area. The selling of Lusatia´s coal mining industry was described by Ende Gelände as the biggest single investment in coal power in Europe. Ende Gelände intended to stop the selling process.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ende-gelaende.org/de/aktion/aufruf/ Ende Gelände 2016 Aufruf&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Vattenfall should have, according to Ende Gelände, financed a social coal phase out and cover ecological follow up expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interventionistische-linke.org/termin/ende-gelaende-und-wie-weiter|title=Ende Gelände ... und wie weiter? - Interventionistische Linke|work=interventionistische-linke.org|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mining region was eventually, after renewed debates in the Swedish Parliament as a direct response to Ende Gelände,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/en/|title=Start|first=|last=Riksdagsförvaltningen|work=riksdagen.se|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; sold to [[Energetický a průmyslový holding|EPH]] in October 2016. Vattenfall initially expected to sell for 2 to 3 billion Euro, but finally had to pay EPH 1,7 billion for EPH taking over all (especially ecological) liabilities in the region.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ende-gelaende.org/de/press-release/vatteinfail-offener-brief-vom-23-06-2016/ Press Release from Ende Gelände, German language, 23.6.2016&lt;/ref&gt; Ende Gelände had the motto in 2016 "we are the investment risk".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ende-gelaende.org/en/action/call-out/ Call for Action 2016, English&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisers describes Ende Gelände 2016 as "the largest ever global civil disobedience against fossil fuels".&lt;ref name=Milman/&gt;

The '''Flensburg Government''' ({{lang-de|Flensburger Regierung}}), also known as the '''Flensburg Cabinet''' (''Flensburger Kabinett''), the '''Dönitz Government''' (''Regierung Dönitz''), or the '''Schwerin von Krosigk Cabinet''' (''Kabinett Schwerin von Krosigk''), was the short-lived government of [[Nazi Germany]] during a period of three weeks around the end of [[World War II]] in Europe. The government was formed following the [[suicide of Adolf Hitler]] on 30 April 1945 during the [[Battle of Berlin]]. It was headed by Grand Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]] as the [[Reichspräsident]] and [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk]] as the Leading Minister.

The administration was referred to as the "Flensburg Government" because Dönitz's headquarters had been relocated in the port of [[Flensburg]] in northern Germany on 3 May 1945.{{sfn|Jones|2015|p=88}} Due to the rapid [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] advance, its nominal jurisdiction at the outset was limited to a narrow wedge of territory running from the [[Austria]]n border through Berlin to the Danish border; which, since 25 April 1945, had been cut in two by the American advance to join with Soviet forces at [[Torgau]] on the [[Elbe]].  Following the capitulation of all German armed forces on 8 May, the Flensburg government lost all direct territorial, military or civil jurisdiction, and all diplomatic relations were withdrawn. The western Allies allowed the Flensburg government to continue to meet and conduct what business it could until 23 May, when they dissolved the government and arrested its members as [[prisoners of war]].{{sfn|Jones|2015|p=323}}

==Formation==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-127-06A, Karl Dönitz - crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Karl Dönitz]]

Once it became apparent that Hitler intended to stay and die in the besieged city of Berlin, effective overall command of German armed forces was exercised through the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (German High Command), which had relocated to [[Rheinsburg]].  Anticipating that German-held territory would be split, separate military and civilian commands had provisionally been established on 15 April; under Field Marshal [[Albert Kesselring]] at [[Pullach]] for forces in the south and west, and under Grand Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]] at [[Plön]] for forces in the north and east; but then Hitler had stalled on transferring executive military authority to them.

On 27 April [[Wilhelm Keitel]] and [[Alfred Jodl]], of the Army High Command, met at Rheinsburg with [[Karl Dönitz]] and [[Heinrich Himmler]] to discuss the war situation now that the [[Battle of Berlin|fall of Berlin]] could not be averted. Himmler took the chair as the acknowledged deputy [[Führer]]; and, since the disgrace and dismissal of [[Hermann Göring]], Hitler's expected successor. As they were leaving Rheinsberg on 28 April, Himmler asked Dönitz to confirm that he would be willing to serve in a successor government that Himmler might form. That day however, the British and Americans published Himmler's secret proposals for a separate peace in the West (which they had rejected). On 29 April Dönitz received a telegram from [[Martin Bormann]] announcing Himmler's dismissal from all posts, and ordering his arrest for treason.{{sfn|Jones|2015|p=88}}&gt; Dönitz went to Himmler's headquarters in Lübeck on 30 April to confront him with the accusations, but Himmler denied them as fabricated propaganda. When a further telegram from Bormann that day confirmed both the dismissal and Dönitz's appointment as Hitler's successor, Himmler's position became untenable, and Dönitz summoned him to Plön that night to tell him so.

With Himmler and [[Hermann Göring|Göring]] standing accused of treasonable negotiation with the enemy, Hitler in his [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|political testament]] had named Grand Admiral Dönitz his successor as [[President of Germany (1919–1945)|Reich President]] and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, and designated Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] head of government as [[Chancellor of Germany|Reich Chancellor]].{{sfn|Jones|2015|p=20}} Goebbels committed suicide in the Berlin ''[[Führerbunker]]'' on 1 May. The same day Dönitz accepted the offices of Supreme Commander and Head of State in separate broadcast addresses to the German armed forces, and German people.{{sfn|Jones|2015|p=89}} Residual ministers of the [[Hitler Cabinet|Hitler cabinet]], who had fled from the fall of Berlin to join Dönitz at the [[Wehrmacht]] barracks near [[Plön]] in [[Holstein]], resigned the next day.  Suspecting that Bormann might also have escaped from Berlin and be intending to seize power, Dönitz met with Hitler's former Finance Minister [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk]] and asked him to constitute a new [[Cabinet of Germany|Reich government]].{{sfn|Jones|2015|p=96}}

Von Krosigk's cabinet first met in [[Eutin]], to which he and his ministerial staff had been evacuated, on 2 May. Later on 2 May, and in view of the rapidly advancing British [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] forces which were approaching [[Lübeck]], Dönitz met with von Krosigk, [[Paul Wegener (Gauleiter)|Paul Wegener]], Himmler and Keitel to discuss the urgent necessity of a further relocation. Himmler argued for a move to [[Prague]], then the last major central European capital city in German hands, and closer to advancing American forces with whom he hoped to negotiate personally, but Dönitz refused to sanction any move outside the borders of Germany. Moreover, the political situation of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] was highly unstable. Dönitz decided instead to proceed to the [[Naval Academy at Mürwik|Mürwik naval academy]] in [[Flensburg]] near the Danish border. The cabinet met in the Sportschool of the naval academy; while administrative offices and accommodation for the various ministries were established on the liner {{Interlanguage link multi|MV Patria (1938)|de|3=Patria (Schiff, 1938)|lt=''Patria''}}, moored in Flensburg harbour.  The German High Command, which had moved from Rheinsburg to [[Neustadt in Holstein]] two days before, then also relocated to Flensburg, while the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] leadership had been gathering at Flensburg since 28 April.

Dönitz avoided including prominent Nazi leaders in his cabinet other than Speer; but included several serving officers in the SS and others who had been closely involved in formulating and prosecuting the genocidal policies of the former regime.  Herbert Backe had been the author of the [[Hunger Plan]] of 1941, a deliberate strategy for mass elimination by starvation of Soviet prisoners of war and 'surplus' Soviet urban populations. Speer's deputy in the Economics Ministry was [[Otto Ohlendorf]], who had personally directed the murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews and Communists in occupied Soviet territory. Wilhelm Stuckart had been a participant at the [[Wannsee Conference]] of January 1942, when the administrative responsibilities for the "[[Final Solution]] to the Jewish Problem" had been agreed.  Otto Ohlendorf had transferred across directly from directing Himmler's office as [[Reichsführer-SS]]; and overall, of 350 staff working in the offices of the Flensburg government, 230 had been members of the SS or other security services.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=359}} Dönitz's cabinet picks were clearly circumscribed by who was available. Otherwise, and in spite of his subsequent claim that his government was 'unpolitical', the most consistent characteristic of those chosen was a virulent opposition to Bolshevism, and a determination to ensure that the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|revolutionary events]] in Germany attending the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice of 1918]] would not be repeated in 1945. As Dönitz did not then intend any surrender to the Soviets or Poles and continued to identify "Jews and profiteers” as enemies of the German people, he had little compunction over including in his cabinet men with blood on their hands, so long as that blood was Russian, East European or Jewish.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=359}}

For the first few days the post of Minister of the Interior was kept vacant.  This had been the office of [[Heinrich Himmler]], but Himmler had been condemned as a traitor, dismissed from all functions and ordered to be arrested in [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's Last Testament]]. Dönitz did not want Himmler's name associated with his new government, but nor could he afford to alienate the SS who remained armed and powerful. He tacitly set Hitler's instructions aside and continued to see Himmler on a daily basis without according him any formal appointment. It was only on 6 May 1945, while final negotiations were in prospect for a capitulation to U.S. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in the west, that Dönitz dismissed Himmler from all his posts, and appointed Stuckart in his place.

=== Armed forces High Command ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H30220, Wilhelm Keitel.jpg|thumb|upright|Wilhelm Keitel]]
Dönitz had hoped to be able to appoint Field Marshal [[Erich von Manstein]] as Commander in Chief of the Army and Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces ([[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]), to which the Army High Command ([[Oberkommando des Heeres]]) had been subject since 28 April 1945, but he could not be contacted on 2 May, and so Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]] was kept in post; and in this capacity Keitel signed the act of surrender for the German High Command in Berlin on 8 May. A further factor favouring the continuation of Keitel as Commander in Chief, was the support for him of [[Colonel General]] [[Alfred Jodl]], the Chief of Operations Staff of the ''Wehrmacht'', whose retention Dönitz recognised as essential. Jodl was to represent Dönitz in negotiations with the Allies in [[Reims]], France. Admiral [[Hans-Georg von Friedeburg]] was appointed to succeed Dönitz as Commander of the [[Kriegsmarine]], and was promoted by Dönitz to the rank of ''[[Generaladmiral]]'' on 1 May. The Air Force had largely been destroyed or grounded due to lack of fuel, so no new appointment was made, Field Marshal [[Robert Ritter von Greim]] remaining Commander of the [[Luftwaffe]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=360}}

In spite of its repeated relocations, the Armed Forces High Command continued to function, its organisation and structures having been maintained. But the same was not true of any other arm of government. Starting in March 1945, the staff of the various ministries had been evacuated to resort hotels in the Bavarian and Austrian Alps – chiefly in the region of [[Berchtesgaden]], leaving only the ministers themselves in Berlin. On 13 April, the remaining foreign embassies and the diplomatic corps were evacuated to [[Bad Gastein]]. Finally on 20 April all the ministers and their personal staffs had been ordered to make their way southwards; but as by then the roads had been cut and there were insufficient transport aircraft available, several ministers (like von Krosigk) had perforce headed north instead. But consequently the government of Germany was, at the death of Hitler, split over six centres. The [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Ministry]], the personal fiefdom of [[Joseph Goebbels]] had remained with him in Berlin, as had the [[Nazi Party Chancellery]] under [[Martin Bormann]]; while the [[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe|Luftwaffe High Command]] had relocated to Berchtesgaden, having been until his abrupt dismissal on 23 April the counterpart fiefdom of Göring. Himmler had retained his personal powerbase in the offices of the SS and security apparatus, which had been established in Lübeck in the north and then relocated to Flensburg. Other government ministries and ministers were then variously located at Berchtesgaden and Dönitz's headquarters in Plön. With the Armed Forces High Command also located in the north – although many OKW personnel had gone south – there was, in consequence, no semblance any longer of a German central government, and most of the members of von Krosigk's cabinet lacked any support staff from their nominal ministries.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99621, Heinrich Himmler.jpg|thumb|upright|Heinrich Himmler]]
Dönitz's initial priority was to open communication with the commanders of German armies, and to establish with them their acknowledgement of his new authority as sole Supreme Commander of all German armed forces. He also sought their agreement with his overall policy of negotiating successive partial surrenders with the Western Allies, while maintaining the war against Soviet forces in the east.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=362}} Key to this was sidelining [[Heinrich Himmler]],{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=359}} [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]],{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=361}} [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and other former Nazi grandees who had fled to Flensburg, but whose continued participation in government would preclude any negotiation with the western Allies. Dönitz's intentions in this were, if possible, to split the Allies, and to offer German military units as components of a common anti-Bolshevik front. Failing that, he sought to save as many German soldiers as possible from Soviet captivity by ordering units in the east to retreat westwards and surrender to the British, Canadians or Americans, and by redoubling [[Operation Hannibal]], the maritime evacuation of units trapped on the Baltic coast. At Dönitz's urging, Field Marshal Keitel and General Jodl attempted to direct what was left of the Wehrmacht towards these goals.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{citation | publisher = iBiblio | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1945/450506a.html#1 | title = The German Surrender Documents – WWII}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 2 May, Dönitz obtained pledges of allegiance from the commanders of German armies in Norway, Courland, East Prussia and Bohemia; these pledges were made to him personally as Supreme Commander, and not as Head of State in a forthcoming government.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=352}}

Otherwise however, Dönitz's policies chiefly demonstrated continuity with the previous regime.  The Nazi party was neither banned nor dissolved. Dönitz kept a bust of Hitler in his office; and the uniforms, insignia and protocol of the Third Reich were maintained, initially including even the '[[Nazi salute|Heil Hitler]]' greeting. Following a plea from Speer, Dönitz on 2 May rescinded the infamous '[[Nero Decree]]' ordering [[scorched earth]] destruction of German infrastructure and industrial plant; but it was not until 6 May that counterpart destruction orders were rescinded for those territories, such as Norway, remaining under German occupation.  Moreover, neither summary courts for civil punishment, nor military discipline by summary courts martial were abolished; with military executions for insulting the memory of Hitler being confirmed even after the final capitulation on 8 May.

While the presence of SS leaders and their staffs in Flensburg had provided Dönitz with a source of personnel to support his government, otherwise they presented problems. In particular, the SS leadership had access to armed forces that were not under Dönitz's control, and remained firmly loyal to Himmler, whom Dönitz had surmised was personally unacceptable now both to the Western Allies and to the Wehrmacht. Dönitz handled the issue by stringing Himmler along for as long as he could with vague prospects of a possible function in the government. Once serious negotiations were underway for surrender to Eisenhower, Himmler and the SS apparatus had to be got out of the way. On 5 May 1945 Dönitz informed Himmler of his forthcoming dismissal, promising false papers and identities for him and his leading lieutenants if they removed themselves promptly. Himmler called his fellow SS leaders together for a last time that day, and advised them to 'dive down within the Wehrmacht'.  By the next day they had fled.

This came too late for the concentration camp prisoners within the area who were now within Dönitz's nominal authority, while under the actual control of the SS.  These had numbered around 10,000 when Dönitz assumed the Presidency; mainly former inmates of the Neuengamme camp outside Hamburg, which had been shut down in preparation for the surrender of the city to the British. Between 16 and 28 April, the prisoners had been moved eastwards and concealed by the SS in a flotilla of unseaworthy ships anchored in the Bay of Lubeck, where they then remained without food or medical attention. At the time, this action had been protested by Rear Admiral Konrad Englehardt on Dönitz's staff, but when the Flensburg government came into being, Dönitz made no attempt to free the prisoners, and his government avoided any subsequent acknowledgement that they had known they were there.  On 3 May 1945, the prison flotilla was sunk by the Royal Air Force in the mistaken belief that the ships were being prepared to evacuate leading SS personnel. Over 7,000 prisoners drowned, mainly on the former liner [[SS Cap Arcona (1927)|Cap Arcona]].

=== Partial capitulations in the West ===

On 2 May, while still at Plön, Dönitz was surprised to learn that German forces in Italy had surrendered unconditionally to the Western Allies. The capitulation had been negotiated without Hitler's knowledge or consent, and signed at [[Surrender of Caserta|Caserta]] on 29 April but did not come into effect for three days.  While Hitler had been still alive, Dönitz had followed absolutely his commands to fight on to the last on all fronts.  However, he now realized that the Wehrmacht's position in the West was untenable. He believed that surrendering German forces only to the Western Allies could present opportunities to split the British and Americans from the Soviets.  Thereon he assumed direction of further German surrender initiatives, exploring opportunities for partial surrender in the West. In the East, however, he continued to order German armies to fight on. On 2 May, he tried unsuccessfully to countermand the decisions of the German commander in [[Berlin]] to surrender their forces to the Soviets; and on 3 May, issued orders to the besieged defenders of Courland and Breslau to maintain their resistance.

[[File:Bernard Law Montgomery.jpg|thumb|upright|Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery]]
On 3 May Dönitz sent Admiral [[Hans-Georg von Friedeburg]], his successor as naval commander in chief, to the headquarters of British Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] at [[Lüneburg]], with an offer to surrender of German forces in northwest Germany, together with the remaining elements of [[Army Group Vistula]]. Montgomery informed Admiral von Friedeburg that he could not accept the surrender of forces fighting on the Eastern Front; and that consequently Army Group Vistula would have to surrender to the Soviets although British forces would accept the surrender of any German soldiers fleeing westwards. He proposed instead, following discussions between Eisenhower and the British government, that he would accept the surrender of all German military forces in Northwestern Germany, [[Schleswig-Holstein]], the Netherlands and Denmark, including naval forces and warships in those areas.  Von Friedeburg asked for 48 hours to consider this; Montgomery allowed him 24. The proposed inclusion of Denmark, and the German warships operating there, initially alarmed Dönitz, who wished at all costs to maintain [[Operation Hannibal]], evacuating German troops across the Baltic to Danish ports; but on consideration, he reckoned he might secretly evade the obligation to surrender these ships if they were at sea on the date the surrender came into effect.  Furthermore, as it was unlikely that Montgomery would promptly be able to deploy British forces to the Danish islands under German occupation, especially [[Bornholm]] in the central Baltic, there was every possibility that the evacuation proceeding there could continue in total disregard of the agreed surrender terms.  Consequently, authorized by Dönitz, von Friedeburg returned on 4 May and signed an instrument of surrender for all German troops and ships in the Netherlands, Denmark and Northwestern Germany. This was accepted by Montgomery on behalf of Eisenhower.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=367}} This 4 May surrender would become effective at 8:00&amp;nbsp;am on 5 May; so Dönitz ordered all ships involved in Operation Hannibal to undertake a covert final evacuation voyage, while also unilaterally ordering all U-boat actions to cease. One crew in the evacuation fleet refused to set sail; so Dönitz ordered the ringleaders to be arrested for mutiny, tried by summary court martial, and shot.

Also, on 5 May 1945, all German forces in Bavaria and South West Germany signed an act of surrender to the Americans at [[Army Group G|Haar]], outside Munich; coming into effect on 6 May.  Montgomery, always seeking to boost his own public standing at the expense of other Allied commanders, had arranged extensive media coverage of the 4 May signing, but Dönitz and von Krosigk realised that, although he had supplied von Friedeburg with a prepared German text of the surrender documents, Montgomery had failed to issue this to the press.  They consequently broadcast their own, doctored, German version; which differed significantly from that signed; specifically in that warships in the Baltic were not included nor was the territory in Schleswig around Flensburg itself; and especially, the surrender was described as a 'truce', not a capitulation. As was Dönitz's intention, this broadcast exacerbated Stalin's suspicions of the partial capitulations, especially as the greater parts of the [[3rd Panzer Army]] and [[21st Army (Wehrmacht)|21st Army]] had indeed been able to surrender to the British and Americans, rather than the Soviets.  Realising this, Eisenhower determined that no further partial capitulations would be negotiated.

The capitulations at Luneberg and Haar could do nothing however for the bulk of German forces in [[Army Group Centre]], fighting the Soviets in [[Bohemia]] and [[Saxony]].  On 4 May Dönitz, together with [[Karl Hermann Frank|Karl Frank]] the Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, conceived of a device whereby Army Group Centre might be able to surrender to General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]]'s American forces, who had been entering the [[Sudetenland]] areas of former [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] from the west, and approaching [[Plzeň|Pilsen]].  Dönitz proposed that Frank should dissolve the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and resign in favour of a puppet Czech government; who would then declare [[Prague]] an [[open city]] and invite the Americans in. General Patton's virulent anti-communist views were well known to the German leadership, who reckoned that with Patton in Prague it would become much easier for Army Group Centre to negotiate surrender terms with him while maintaining their resistance to the Soviets, if possible dragging American and Soviet armies into direct confrontation. Frank had hopes that "we can engineer a disagreement between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union even more serious than that of Poland". The ploy was proposed as being put into effect on 5 May, but was overtaken by the outbreak of the [[Prague uprising]] on that date; and over the succeeding three days, far from surrendering Prague as an open city, SS forces launched a savage response to the insurgents, with brutal reprisals against Czech civilians and widespread destruction in central Prague. Orders to fire-bomb the whole of the [[Old Town (Prague)|Old Town]] were only averted due to lack of fuel for Luftwaffe bombing units. Alerted to the German machinations through intercepted [[Ultra]] signals, Eisenhower ordered Patton to stand still in Pilsen in spite of ever more desperate calls for help from the insurgents. Prague was finally relieved by General [[Ivan Konev|Konev]]'s forces on 9 May 1945.

=== General capitulation on all fronts ===
[[File:Meeting of the Supreme Command.jpg|thumb|SHAEF commanders at a conference in London]]
Following the success of the two partial surrenders of 4 and 5 May, Dönitz instructed von Friedeburg to go to the [[Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) to negotiate with General Eisenhower terms for a general surrender of all remaining German armies to the Western Allies.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=369}} Since von Friedeburg's meeting with Montgomery, Eisenhower's opposition to accepting a German surrender that excluded the Soviet Union had been made clear to the German High Command, but Dönitz hoped to change his mind.

On the next day, 5 May, von Friedeburg arrived at General Eisenhower's headquarters at [[Reims]], France, but learned that Eisenhower was resolute that only a total surrender on all fronts to all the Allies could be discussed. Jodl arrived a day later, ostensibly to sign such a general surrender. Dönitz had instructed him to draw out the negotiations for as long as possible so that German troops and refugees could move west to surrender to the Western Powers. Eisenhower made it clear that the Allies demanded immediate unconditional surrender on all fronts. When it became obvious that the Germans were stalling, Eisenhower threatened to close the western front to all surrendering Germans from the east.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=371}} Had this happened, German soldiers attempting to cross the line to surrender would be fired on and all subsequent surrenders would have to be to the Soviets. When Dönitz learned this, he radioed Jodl [[full powers]] to sign the unconditional [[German Instrument of Surrender]] at 1.30&amp;nbsp;am on the morning of 7 May. Just over an hour later, Jodl signed the documents. The surrender documents included the phrase, "The German High Command will at once issue orders to all German military, naval and air authorities and to all forces under German control to cease active operations at 2301 hours Central European time on 8 May and to remain in the positions occupied at that time."  The Western Allies had a unified command structure, and formed a single expeditionary force, the "Allied Expeditionary Force". U.S. Army General [[Walter Bedell Smith]] (Eisenhower's chief of staff at SHAEF) signed on behalf of the Western Allies, and General [[Ivan Susloparov]] (the Soviet liaison officer at SHAEF) signed on behalf of the Soviets. French Major General [[François Sevez]] signed as the official witness.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Although Eisenhower had sought to keep General [[Aleksei Antonov]] of the Soviet High Command fully informed of the progress of the surrender negotiations, no confirmation had been received from the Soviets that the text of the Act of Military Surrender was acceptable to them, or that Susloparov was empowered to sign it.  Accordingly, Eisenhower extracted from Jodl an additional signed undertaking that the Chief of the German [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|High Command]], and the Commanders in Chief of all three German armed services would attend in person and sign a "formal ratification" of the Act of Military Surrender, at a place and date to be specified.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  Some six hours after the signing, a response came from Antonov that terms of surrender were unacceptable, and that Susloparov could not sign it. Eisenhower promptly agreed, and undertook to attend together with the rest of the SHAEF for the definitive signing in Berlin two days later. Antonov's response also noted that von Friedeburg had been referring matters back to Dönitz over the radio; and that Dönitz, in direct breach of the signed surrender terms, had still not issued orders for German forces in the east to remain in their positions but was instead instructing them to continue their resistance and flee westwards. Antonov stated that, while the internal discussions of the German military in no way obligated the Allied Powers, Jodl's signature could not be accepted as valid if he was doing so as Dönitz's representative since Dönitz himself was clearly acting in bad faith.  He proposed that the definitive act of surrender should make it clear that the Commanders in Chief of each of the German armed services were, in signing it, surrendering their forces on the authority of the German High Command - and not as delegated by Dönitz or the purported Flensburg government.

A second, amended, instrument of surrender was accordingly signed at Karlshorst, Berlin on 8 May shortly before midnight.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=372}} Marshal Zhukov signed for the Soviet High Command, and the British Marshal of the [[Royal Air Force]] [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|A.W. Tedder]] signed on behalf of the Western Allies. (Tedder acted as Eisenhower's representative at the Berlin ceremony, and signed "on behalf of the Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force", in his capacity as Deputy Supreme Commander.) French General [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]] and [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] General [[Carl Andrew Spaatz|Carl Spaatz]] signed as the official witnesses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The Allies had demanded that representatives of the German Army, Navy and Air Force, and the High Command of the Armed Forces, sign the ratification of unconditional surrender, and that they should present full powers authorizing them to do so on behalf of the German High Command.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Complying with that demand Dönitz issued a telegraphed communication from his "Supreme Commander Headquarters" (''Der Oberste Befehlshaber Hauptquartier'') granting the necessary full powers,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The text of the full powers, in German, was as follows: A b s c h r i f t. Der Oberste Befehlshaber Hauptquartier, den 7.5.45. der Wehrmacht /Bitte in der Antwort vorstehendesGeschaftszeichen, das Datum und kurzen Inhalt anzugegen./ICH BEVOLLMACHTIGE GENERALFELDMARSCHALL K E I T E L ALS CHEF DES OBERKOMMANDOS DER WEHRMACHT UND ZUGLEICH ALS OBERBEFEHLSHABER DES HEERES, GENERALADMIRAL VON FRIEDBERG ALS OBERBEFEHLSHABER DER KRIEGSMARINE, GENERALOBERST S T U M P F ALS VERTRETER DES OBERBEFEHLSHABERS DER LUFTWAFFE ZUR RATIFIZIERUNG DER BEDINGUNGSLKSEN KAPITULATION DER DEUTSCHEN STREITKRAFTE GEGENUBER DEM OBERBEFEHLSHABER DER ALLIIERTEN EXPEDITIONSSTREITKRAFTE UND DEM SOWYET-OBER-KOMMANDO. DONITZ GROßADMIRAL. Siegel.&lt;/ref&gt; and accordingly the second Act of Military Surrender was signed by Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]] as Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces and as acting Commander in Chief of the Army; by Admiral von Friedeburg as the Commander in Chief of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (navy), by General [[Hans-Jürgen Stumpff]] as Deputy Commander in Chief of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force) as Field Marshal [[Robert Ritter von Greim]], the Air Force Commander, had been injured. At the time specified, [[end of World War II in Europe|World War II in Europe ended]]. On 9 May, Dönitz issued orders to the German Armed Forces regarding the military surrender.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=376}}

The text of the definitive surrender document signed in Berlin differed from that previously signed at Reims, chiefly in that, to the second article, was added the words "..and to disarm completely, handing over their weapons and equipment to the local allied commanders or officers designated by the Representatives of the Allied Supreme Command"; which had the effect of requiring German troop facing Soviet forces to hand over their weapons, disband and give themselves up as prisoners. Otherwise neither the Reims nor Berlin surrender instruments provided explicitly for the surrender of the German State, because the draft surrender document prepared by the [[European Advisory Commission]] (EAC) was not used. Instead, a simplified, military-only version had been produced by the SHAEF, based largely on the wording of the partial surrender instrument of German forces in Italy that had been signed at Caserta. This definition of the surrender as an act of military capitulation side-stepped any Allied recognition of the German Government, or of Dönitz as Head of State. The question of the civil effects of the unconditional surrender was only settled later, when the Allies decided to dissolve the Flensburg Government (23 May) and issued the Berlin declaration, proclaiming the direct assumption of the supreme governmental authority in Germany by the Allied Powers (5 June). The text of the Berlin Declaration was widely based on the EAC's draft instrument of surrender of Germany. The said draft was reworked into a unilateral declaration with an extended explanatory preamble, that spelled out the Allied position that as a result of its complete defeat Germany had been left without a government, a vacuum that the direct assumption of supreme authority by the Allies would replace.

==Dissolution==

=== Withdrawal of diplomatic recognition ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Alber-178-04A, Walter Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|upright|Walter Schellenberg]]
During 1944 and 1945 countries that had been neutral or allies of Germany had been joining the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] and declaring war on Germany.  The German embassies to these countries had been closed down, and their property and archives held in trust by a nominated [[protecting power]] (usually [[Switzerland]] or [[Sweden]]) under the terms of the [[Geneva Conventions]]. There were counterpart arrangements for the former embassies of Allied countries in Berlin. The [[United States Department of State]] had prepared for the diplomatic consequences of the war ending on the assumption that there would have been an explicit statement of unconditional surrender of the German state in accordance with the terms of a draft surrender text jointly agreed by the Allied powers in 1944. In the final days of April 1945 the State Department had notified the protecting powers, and all other remaining neutral governments (such as [[Ireland]]), that following the forthcoming German surrender the continued identity of the German state would rest solely in the four Allied Powers. The Allied Powers would immediately recall all German diplomatic staff, take ownership of all German state property, extinguish all protecting power functions, and require the transfer of all archives and records to one or another of the embassies of the western Allies.&lt;ref name="Eckert 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last= Eckert| first = Astrid. M.| title = The Struggle for the Files|translator = Dona Geyer| publisher = CUP| date = 2012| pages = 222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 May 1945, these arrangements were put into effect in full, notwithstanding that the only German parties to the signed surrender document had been the German High Command. The western Allies maintained that a functioning German state had already ceased to exist, and that consequently the surrender of the German military had effected the complete termination of [[Nazi Germany]]. The protecting powers complied fully with the Allied demands: Sweden, Switzerland and Ireland announced the breaking off of relations; consequently the German state ceased as a diplomatic entity on 8 May 1945. [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]], the only remaining Axis belligerent, had already denounced the German surrender and Flensburg government, and seized the German embassy in Tokyo and seven U-boats. Henceforward, although the Flensburg government had a nominated Minister for Foreign Affairs, it had no access to the diplomatic assets of the former German state and was not accorded diplomatic recognition by any of the former protecting powers or other remaining neutral countries. On 5 May Von Krosigk had dispatched [[Walter Schellenberg]] to Sweden as a personal emissary via [[Folke Bernadotte]], hoping to establish diplomatic relations and to expedite a partial surrender of German forces in Norway. This mission was overtaken by the general capitulation of all German forces, and following 8 May all further approaches from the Flensburg Government to Sweden were ignored.

Former armaments minister [[Albert Speer]] suggested that after the surrender the Flensburg government should dissolve itself. Instead Dönitz and his ministers chose to continue in hope of presiding over post-war Germany as a [[provisional government]]. Even though they could exercise no direct territorial authority, the cabinet still met daily at 10.00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Various papers on post-war reconstruction issues were proposed to be prepared, but the Western Allies showed no sign that they might receive them. Otherwise much time was devoted to discussion of how far the symbols, medals and insignia of the Hitler regime should be retained within the Flensburg headquarters.

=== Nazi war crimes ===
Some acknowledgement of Nazi war crimes became unavoidable. The departure of the SS leadership from Flensburg opened the way for the Dönitz government to offer its own version of how the murder squads, concentration camps and killing facilities had come into being.  Their response was that all these atrocities had been undertaken in secret, and entirely by Himmler and the SS. Dönitz and Jodl issued a joint public statement "that neither the German Wehrmacht nor the German people had knowledge of these things."  While this statement was mostly untrue, the consequent [[Clean Wehrmacht|myth of the "good Wehrmacht"]] as having been deceived and betrayed by the "evil SS" was to achieve wide currency for decades in post-war Germany.{{CN|date=August 2018}}

=== Allied perspectives ===

While it had been agreed amongst the Allies that the Flensburg government should be accorded no official recognition, [[Winston Churchill]] proved reluctant to toe the line.  In his speech announcing victory to the British people on 8 May, Churchill specified that the surrender had been authorised by “Grand Admiral Dönitz, the designated Head of the German State”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Winston | last = Churchill | url = http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/speeches/speeches-of-winston-churchill/95-end-of-the-war-in-europe | title = End of the War in Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, following the unconditional surrender, Churchill was instrumental in urging that the Flensburg Government should not immediately be closed down, saying that he could see "great advantages in letting things slide for a bit". Churchill's attitude in this was conditioned by his concern that Soviet forces might seek to establish themselves in Denmark; and he saw the temporary continuation of the Flensburg government in territory under British control as establishing a bargaining counter for the British in any negotiations regarding Soviet intentions in the western Baltic, while also facilitating the disbanding of German forces.

Conversely, Soviet statements consistently characterised the Flensburg government as an anti-Bolshevist clique. On 20 May, the Soviet government made it clear what it thought about the Flensburg Government. It attacked the Dönitz Administration, calling it the "Dönitz Gang" and harshly criticised any idea of allowing it to retain any power. ''[[Pravda]]'' said:

{{quote|Discussions of the status of the Fascist gang around Dönitz continue. Several prominent Allied circles will deem it necessary to make use of the "services" of Dönitz and his collaborators. In the British Parliament, this gang has been described as the 'Dönitz Administration'…. A reporter of the reactionary [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst]] press has called the enlistment of Dönitz "an act of political sagacity."  Thus a Fascist scribbler has seen fit to make common cause with Hitler's marauding disciple. At the same time, the Fascist press on both sides of the Atlantic has put it abroad that conditions in Germany in 1918, when German Rightists produced similar fairy-tales of impending chaos. Then, the intact German Army units were used for new adventures in the East, immediately after capitulation. The present campaign has similar objectives. Many reactionary circles around the Allies are opposed to the creation of a new Europe on the basis of the Crimea Conference. These circles consider the preservation of Fascist states and breeding grounds as a means of thwarting the democratic aspirations of all freedom-loving nations....&lt;ref&gt;Dollinger, Hans (1995) [1965]. ''The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan: A Pictorial History of the Final Days of World War II'', p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;}}

General Eisenhower tended rather to agree with the Soviet position (if not the reasoning behind it), suspecting that Dönitz and his cabinet could be a front, while the real German leadership, perhaps including Himmler, [[Martin Bormann]] and Hitler himself (whose remains were not then known to have been identified), remained operating behind the scenes, or otherwise plotting for their concealment and escape.  With ill-disguised reluctance Eisenhower agreed to defer to the British view for a short period, but issued a clarifying statement that the continuation of the Dönitz government did not constitute his being recognised as a head of state "but only and temporarily under the instructions of the Allied Commanders to carry out duties concerning the feeding, disarming and medical care of the German Armed Forces."

=== Final dissolution of the Flensburg Government ===

On 12 May, American Major General Lowell W. Rooks and his British deputy, Brigadier E. J. Foord, arrived in Flensburg and established their quarters in the passenger ship ''Patria'', docked in Flensburg harbour, displacing the administrative offices of the Flensburg government that had been housed there. Their mission was to liaise with the Dönitz "acting government" (as it was then referred to by the SHAEF) and to impose the will of the victorious Allied Powers on the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]].  Although the liaison mission arranged meetings with members of the Flensburg government, these only confirmed that neither Dönitz nor his ministers had been able to establish any degree of civil authority. Churchill withdrew his protection once it became clear that the Soviet High Command would otherwise have to be represented in the liaison mission. On 21 May the SHAEF acceded to Soviet proposals that the Flensburg Government be dissolved and its members arrested as POWs.  The dissolution was carried out on 23 May. On that day, a British officer went to Dönitz's headquarters and asked to speak to the members of the government. Dönitz, von Friedeburg and Jodl were then taken aboard the ''Patria'', where Maj. Gen. Rooks informed them of the dissolution of the government; placing them under arrest, and ordering that they be stripped and searched for concealed [[wikt:phial|phials]] of poison.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/other/us-army_germany_1944-46_ch15.htm Chapter XV: The Victory Sealed]. Globalsecurity.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trove.nla.gov.au"&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55858898 26 May 1945 – High Command Arrested]. Trove.nla.gov.au (26 May 1945).&lt;/ref&gt;

The communication regarding the dissolution of the acting government and the arrest of its members was made in a formal manner, around a table on ''Patria''{{'}}s deck: Dönitz, Jodl and Von Friedeburg sat on one side, with Major General Rooks, British Navy Captain Mund and Soviet General Trusov on the other. Brigadier Foord remained standing, next to Maj. Gen. Rooks, and an official interpreter was also present at the proceedings, that were photographed.&lt;ref name="trove.nla.gov.au"/&gt; By the time Dönitz emerged from the ship, the town's main street was filled with British tanks and troops rounding up the Germans. Faced with the prospect of being strip-searched, von Friedeburg committed suicide, while Dönitz, Speer, Jodl and other members of the dissolved Flensburg Government were taken prisoner,&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"/&gt; under the responsibility of a [[RAF Regiment]] task force commanded by Squadron Leader Mark Hobden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The RAF Regiment at War 1942-1946|last=Oliver|first=Kingsley M|publisher=Pen &amp; Sword|year=|isbn=|location=Great Britain 2002|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/air-force-obituaries/10085223/Group-Captain-Mark-Hobden.html|title=Daily Telegraph|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prisoners were later handed over to the [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]]. Some Flensburg Government POWs such as Albert Speer were subsequently moved to the British POW camp ''Dustbin'' in [[Castle Kransberg]], while others, including Dönitz, were transferred to the American-led [[Camp Ashcan]]. Later, all Camp Ashcan prisoners were moved to Nuremberg to stand trial.

=== Berlin Declaration: 5 June 1945 ===
[[File:Nazi Personalities BU6713.jpg|thumb|right|Albert Speer (left), Karl Dönitz (center) and Alfred Jodl (right) after their arrest.]]
With the arrest of the Flensburg Government on 23 May 1945, the German High Command also ceased to exist, with no central authority having been kept in place to govern Germany even in a nominal capacity, or to assume responsibility for complying with the demands and instructions of the victorious nations. This power vacuum continued for almost two weeks until 5 June 1945, when the representatives of the Allies signed the ''[[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany and the Assumption of Supreme Authority by Allied Powers]]'', also known as the ''Berlin Declaration''.&lt;ref name="Declaration"&gt;{{cite web |title=Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany and the Assumption of Supreme Authority by Allied Powers; June 5, 1945 |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/ger01.asp |website=Lillian Goldman Law Library |publisher=Yale Law Library |accessdate=30 November 2018 |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Die Sportschule Flensburg-Mürwik (Mai 2014), Bild 002.JPG|thumb|The Sportschool in [[Mürwik]], on the edge of the [[Naval Academy Mürwik]], the seat of the Flensburg Government.]]
The declaration, issued in Berlin at 18:00 on 5 June 1945, and signed by General Eisenhower on behalf of the United States, Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] on behalf of the United Kingdom, Marshal [[Georgiy Zhukov]] on behalf of the Soviet Union, and by General [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]] on behalf of the French Provisional Government, contained the following statement:&lt;ref name="Declaration"/&gt;

{{quote|The Governments of the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom, and the Provisional Government of the French Republic, hereby assume supreme authority with respect to Germany, including all the powers possessed by the German Government, the High Command and any state, municipal, or local government or authority. The assumption, for the purposes stated above, of the said authority and powers does not affect the annexation of Germany.}}

Therefore, from 5 June 1945, Germany did not possess a native government; complete authority and sovereignty being thereafter assumed by the Allied Military Occupation Government. The contention of the Allied Powers that the German [[state (polity)|state]] ceased to exist as of 5 June 1945 was then generally accepted, but came subsequently to be challenged in legal and political debate. In any event, the Berlin Declaration maintained the continued existence of Germany as a national territory, implying the continuation of a German nation.{{CN|date=August 2018}}

During the initial stage of the [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation of Germany]], supreme authority was discharged by the Four Powers jointly for all occupation zones via the [[Allied Control Council]], so that this council was the immediate successor of the Dönitz Administration in the Government of Germany.{{CN|date=August 2018}}

The '''Garrat Elections''' were a [[carnival]] of mock [[election]]s in [[Surrey]], [[England]] in the 18th century. The events were organized around May 20,{{sfn|Chambers|1869}} and would see crowds of tens of thousands travelling {{convert|5|mi|spell=in}} from London to take part. The elections were held for at least fifty years before declining after the death of Mayor "Sir" Harry Dimsdale in 1796.

''Grose's Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue,'' originally published in 1785 by [[Francis Grose]], described the Garrat Election as:
{{quote|A ludicrous ceremony, practiced every new parliament: it consists of a mock election of two members to represent the borough of Garret{{sic}} (a few straggling cottages, near Wandsworth, in Surrey). The qualification of a voter is, having enjoyed a woman, in the open air, within that district: the candidates are commonly fellows of low humor, who dress themselves up in a ridiculous manner. As this brings a prodigious concourse of people to Wandsworth, the publicans of that place jointly contribute to the expense, which is sometimes considerable.{{sfn|Egan|1823|p=130}} }}

==History==

In the 17th century, Garrat was a small hamlet in the parish of [[Wandsworth]]. Its residents had met in a conclave and elected a "commons" president to exert authority over a small common. They felt that the president should hold the office of "mayor" during the parliamentary period between [[general election]]s and should be re-elected with the new one. The minor political spectacle aroused some amusement and locals ended up parodying the affair in their mock election.{{sfn|Barker|1888|p=231}}

The Garrat "elections" were chaired at [[Garratt Lane]],{{sfn|Foote|1824|p={{page needed|date=October 2016}} }} and were popular events, with up to 80,000 attendees and sponsorship from local innkeepers and pub keepers who profited from the occasion. People put forth unusual candidates to parody the features of the real election,{{sfn|Chambers|1869}} with the successful candidate being "the most deformed and stupid".{{sfn|Foote|1824|p={{page needed|date=October 2016}} }} Candidates would deliver speeches with promises and appeals to sentiment, making pledges such as "that they will lower the prices of gin, bread, beer, &amp;c.; make old women bishops; and that they will not accept any place in the House".{{sfn|Foote|1824|p={{page needed|date=October 2016}} }}

The fame of the Garratt elections was spread by [[Samuel Foote]]'s 1763 [[farce]],{{sfn|Foote|1824|p={{page needed|date=October 2016}} }} ''The Mayor of Garret'',{{sfn|Barker|1888|p=231}} and from 1768 candidates often came from London and its surroundings rather than just the Wandsworth area.{{sfn|Chambers|1869}}

After the death of Mayor Harry Dimsdale towards the end of the 18th century, the festival began to lose its drive and innkeepers no longer agreed to pay the expenses. An 1826 attempt to revive the event failed.{{sfn|Chambers|1869}}

==Mayors and candidates==
There is no record of the identity of the candidates before 1747. At that particular year, the "clerk and recorder" from a nonexistent [[town hall]] issued notification of election between ''Squire Blowmedown'' and ''Squire Gubbins'' (waterman and pubkeeper, respectively, in their day-to-day jobs). Both candidates gave out handbills where they praised their own merits and mocked those of their opponent, imitating political leaflets of the day. Same two candidates attended the next election in 1754, again abusing each other and their supporters in their handbills.{{sfn|Chambers|1869}}

Year 1761 saw the number of candidates rise to nine; in addition to previous two there were ''Sir John Crambo'', ''Kit Noisy'' (waterman), ''Lord Lapstone'' (shoemaker), ''Lord Paxford'', ''Lord Twankum'' (cobbler), ''Lord Wedge'' and ''Beau Silvester''. The candidates elicited flowering elocutions praising their own efforts, promising prosperity if they were to be elected and threatening impending disaster if their opponents should be elected instead. Beau Silvester merited himself with resisting the extra tax on ale and giving orders to increase the number of local pubs.{{sfn|Chambers|1869}}

In 1763 candidates Lord Twankum, Kit Noisy and Sir John Crambo mocked each other in electoral contest. In 1768 there were seven candidates; Lord Twankum, ''Sir Christopher Dashem'', ''Sir George Comefirst'', ''Sir William Airey'', ''Sir William Bellows'', one "Batt from the Workhouse", and ''Sir John Harper'' who ended up being the most popular in the following elections. Lady Twankum promised an opulent party for the entertainment of the populace. 1775 election introduced ''Sir William Blaize'', "[[nepotism|Nephew to]] the late Lord Twankum" and ''Sir Christopher Dashem''.{{sfn|Chambers|1869}}

The 1781 election again had nine candidates; old hands Sir John Harper, Sir Christopher Dashwood, and Sir William Blaize and the new ones ''Sir Buggy Bates'' (chimney-sweep), ''Sir John Gnawpost'', ''Sir Thomas Nameless'', ''Sir William Swallowtail'' (basketmaker), ''Sir Thomas Tubbs'' (waterman) and ''[[Sir Jeffrey Dunstan]]'' (wigseller). The latter proved to be the most popular ever in the following elections due to his [[wit]], small size and grotesque and unkempt appearance. Swallowtail had come to the poll in a wicker-chariot of his own design and preceded by hand-bell players. Dashwood was pulled around in a boat. Swallowtail and Buggy Bates were blamed of having government contracts, of baskets and soot, respectively. Sir John Harper and Sir Jeffrey Dunstan were "returned to parliament".{{sfn|Chambers|1869}}

In 1785 elections Sir Jeffrey Dunstan was left without opposition when Sir John Harper died. In 1796 the new candidate ''Sir Harry Dimsdale'' won but he died before the next election.{{sfn|Chambers|1869}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7062">The '''German-Polish Accord on East Silesia''' (&lt;small&gt;[[German language|German]]:&lt;/small&gt; ''Deutsch-Polnisches Abkommen über Oberschlesien)'', also known as the ''Geneva Accord'', of 15 May 1922, dealt with the constitutional and legal future of [[Upper Silesia]] which partly became [[Second Polish Republic|Polish]] territory after a [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|referendum in 1921]].

== Background ==
[[Upper Silesia]] with its mixed Polish and German population was a province of [[Prussia]] and a part of the [[German Reich]] prior to [[World War I]]. In the [[Treaty of Versailles]], after the defeat of [[Imperial Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] in World War I, it was decided that the population of Upper Silesia should hold a plebiscite to determine the division of the province between Poland and Germany, with the exception of a {{convert|333|km²|abbr=on}} area around [[Hlučín]] (''Hultschiner Ländchen''), which was granted to [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1920 despite its a German-speaking majority. The plebiscite, organised by the [[League of Nations]], was held in 1921. In [[Cieszyn Silesia|Teschen Silesia]] there was an interim deal between the Polish and Czechoslovakian [[Polish–Czechoslovak border conflicts#Creation of Poland and Czechoslovakia|local self-government councils]] about the partition of past lands of the [[Duchy of Teschen]] along ethnic lines. However, that deal was not approved by the Czechoslovak government in Prague. Poland held elections in the entire disputed area, and in the [[Polish–Czechoslovak War]] Czech troops invaded the lands of Teschen Silesia on 23 January 1919, stopping on 30 January 1919 on the [[Vistula River|Weichsel River]] near [[Skoczów|Skotschau]].&lt;ref name="Długajczyk"&gt;Długajczyk, ''Tajny front na granicy cieszyńskiej. Wywiad i dywersja w latach 1919–1939'', 1993, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zahradnik"&gt;Zahradnik, ''Korzenie Zaolzia'', 1992, page 59&lt;/ref&gt; The planned plebiscite was not organised in the Teschen region but was held in most other parts of Upper Silesia. On 28 July 1920, the [[Spa Conference of 1920|Spa Conference]] divided Teschen Silesia between Poland and Czechoslovakia along the present-day border.

== Upper Silesia Plebiscite ==
In 1918 various proposals emerged defining the division of [[Upper Silesia]]. At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] a commission for Polish affairs was created to prepare proposals for Polish borders. In their first two proposals (of 27 March 1919 and of 7 May 1919) most of the future province was ceded, together with the region of [[Province of Silesia#Administration|Oppeln]], to Poland. Yet that was not accepted by the ''Big Four'', and following [[David Lloyd George]]'s suggestion, a [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|plebiscite]] was organized. Before it took place on 20 March 1921, two [[Silesian Insurrections]] instigated by [[Poles|Polish]] inhabitants of the area were organized. After the referendum, in which Poland had 41% of the votes, a plan of division was created that divided Upper Silesia.&lt;ref name="Upper Silesia Plebiscite"&gt;[http://www.stamp-collecting-world.com/uppersilesiaplebiscite_history.html Upper Silesia Plebiscite: A Brief History]&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a new phase of the [[Silesian Uprisings]], the socalled [[Third Silesian Uprising]] and the [[Battle of Annaberg]]. The result of the 1921 referendum was legally not binding and ignored. A new plan of division was prepared by the ambassadors commission on 20 October 1921, which should enter into effect by 20 June 1922, but it still created a situation in which some rural territories that voted mostly for Poland were granted to Germany and some urban territories with a German majority were granted to Poland.

== Geneva Accord ==
In 1921 the Geneva conference for regulating conditions in Upper Silesia took place under the chairmanship of [[Felix Calonder]], then member of the [[Swiss Federal Council]]. After the region was divided between Germany and Poland, the German minority population had to be protected by the Accord. The German-Polish Accord on East Silesia is also known as the Geneva Accord of 15 May 1922.

== Consequences ==
On 20 June 1922 the division according to the plan of the ambassadors commission became effective. The German Reich had to accept the loss of its coal-bearing land and was left with the economically unimportant West Upper Silesia. The Silesian coal was highly relevant to the German economy during that time. The major part of Silesia remaining in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], was reorganised into the two provinces of [[Province of Upper Silesia|Upper Silesia]] and [[Province of Lower Silesia|Lower Silesia]].

The Polish [[Sejm]] decided that the eastern-most Upper Silesian areas should become an autonomous area within Poland organised as the [[Silesian Voivodeship (1920–1939)|Silesian Voivodeship]] and with [[Silesian Parliament]] as a constituency and Silesian Voivodeship Council as the executive body. A central political figure was [[Wojciech Korfanty]]. The part of Silesia awarded to Poland was by far the best-developed and richest region of the newly formed state, producing most of Poland's industrial output.

{{Soviet-type economics |}}

'''Gossnab of USSR''', State Supplies of the USSR ({{lang-ru|Госснаб СССР}}) was active in 1948-1953, 1965-1991. It was the state committee for material technical supply in the [[Soviet Union]]. It was charged with the primary responsibility for the allocation of producer goods to enterprises, a critical state function in the absence of [[Market (economics)|market]]s.

Gossnab was one of more than twenty state committees under the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]], the administrative arm of the [[Soviet government]], along with other economic organs such as [[Gosplan]] (the state planning committee) and [[Gosbank]] (the state bank). Created amid a series of economic reforms implemented under [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] [[Alexei Kosygin]] in the mid-1960s, Gossnab coordinated the allocation of resources not handled by [[Gosplan]]. Gossnab had mixed success in creating a wholesale trade system, based on direct contracts between suppliers and users.

==Narkomprod==
Originally founded in 1917 as the '''People's Commissariat for Food Supplies''' ({{lang-ru|Наркомпрод, Народный комиссариат продовольствия}}, [[transliteration|translit.]] ''Narodny Commissariat Prodovolstviya'', often abbreviated as '''Narkomprod''') was the [[People's Commissariat]] (ministry) of the [[Russian SFSR]] in charge of food supplies and industrial goods. The first Commissar was [[Ivan Teodorovich]].

There were several subsidiary organisations:
* 1918 - 1919  - Central Procurement Bureau (Tsentrozakup)
* 1917 - 1918  - Special Commissioner for the Supply of Food for Workers in Enterprises Preparing Fuel for the Country (Khleboles)
* 1918 - 1920  - General Directorate of the Distribution Products (Glavproduct)
* 1918 - 1920  - Extraordinary Regional Committee for Food and Supply of the South of Russia (Chokprod)
* 1918 - 1919  - United bureaus of Russian food and cooperative organizations for food
* 1919 - 1922  - Central Commission for the Supply of Workers (Tsekorabsnab)

The Narkomprod was responsible in June 1918 for the attempted organisation of '[[committees of the poor]]' in provincial [[village]]s. This was an attempt to encourage a '[[class conflict|class war]]' in the countryside but it did not materialise, mainly because the [[peasants]] were not resentful of '[[kulaks]]' (rich peasants) as there was a tendency for all peasants to have the same interests (for example, their own [[land ownership]]).

===Commissars===
* [[Ivan Teodorovich]] (1875-1937) (Russian Иван Адольфович Теодорович), 1917-1917
* [[Alexander Schlichter]] (1868-1940) (Russian Александр Григорьевич Шлихтер), 1917-1918
* [[Alexander Zjurupa]] (1870-1928) (Russian Александр Дмитриевич Цюрупа), 1918-1921
* [[Nikolai Bryukhanov]] (1878-1938) (Russian Николай Павлович Брюханов), 1921-1923
* [[Moisei Kalmanovich]] (1888-1937) (Russian Моисей Иосифович Калманович), 1923-1924

Their website describes their music as combining "elements of [[drumline]], [[taiko]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[North Africa]]n rhythms, elements of [[Balkan music|Balkan fanfares]], [[breakbeats]], and just about anything else."&lt;ref name=text1 /&gt; Although best known for their free (and often confrontational) public performances at political protests,&lt;ref name=obit&gt;Christopher Frizelle, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=50114 R.I.P., INB (1999-2006)], ''The Stranger'', posted online on August 8, 2006, accessed 27 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; they sometimes performed at more conventional concerts and club gigs, usually featured as part of a musically eclectic program.&lt;ref name=gig-list /&gt;

Christopher Frizzelle, in an "obituary" for the band in the Seattle-based arts weekly ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'', remarked that their "most important and dramatic public events were standoffs with cops" and that they "can be credited for keeping WTO protestors energized, focused, and photogenic… What their parties and their protests had in common was intensity, vividness, and a fun, frightening sense that anything could happen. They were lessons in liberation."&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Frizzelle, who travelled with INB on a portion of their European tour, wrote in his review of that tour that the members used "band names", partly to "retain the mystery of the band" and partly to preserve their anonymity from their employers: almost none of the band members are professional musicians. As example, Frizzelle provided the roster from the mainland portion of the European tour: "Annemat, Atomika, B. Q. (whose band name is Red Dot, but no one calls her that), Bluer Than You, Bookworm, Brassbelle, D. P. Punkass ("My whole name is Dread Pirate Punkass, but in print I like to be D. P. Punkass"), DK Pan, Flash, Grey [[Filastine]], Hawtpantz, Ice Frog, In Phase, Megor, Mildred, Mr. Rose, the Professor, Ramon, Satsuma, Skunk, Spider, and Violet."&lt;ref name=Frizzelle/&gt;[With accidental omission of mc sub-zero permafrost].

On 12 August 2007 one hundred thousand Muslims gathered in [[Indonesia]] to call for the return of the [[Caliphate]]. It was one of the largest political gatherings of Muslims ever to have taken place. The event was organised by the [[Islamist]] party, [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]], whose stated intention is to create a new Caliphate encompassing the 'Muslim world'.

Key speakers, including [[Dr Imran Waheed]] were refused entry to [[Jakarta]] and forced to deliver their speeches by video link.

Parallel conferences were also held in the UK and Palestine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2785">The year 2001 was declared the '''International Year of Mobilization against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance''' by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].

The [[International observance#Years|United Nations International Years]], beginning with the [[World Refugee Year]] in 1959/1960, are designated in order to focus world attention on important issues. The decision to devote the year 2001 to mobilization against [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]] was taken by the General Assembly on December 9, 1998 and was linked to the decision to organize a conference, the World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, in the same year. In its resolution (A/RES/53/132) the General Assembly stated that the observance was "aimed at drawing the world’s attention to the objectives of the World Conference and giving new momentum to the political commitment to the elimination of all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance".

The conference was held in Durban, South Africa. 7,000 representatives from civil society participated in an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] Forum from August 28 to 31, 2001. The governmental meeting was held from August 31 to September 7, 2001. A declaration and programme of action was adopted on September 8. [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Mary Robinson]] was the Secretary-General of the conference.

==Early life and education==
Appelbaum says that he tested out of high school and attended junior college briefly before he "stopped college and continued my education."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110219135907/http://crypto.nsa.org/f-21/blogger-in-the-lions-den.html&lt;/ref&gt; In a wide-ranging interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 2010, Appelbaum revealed that "I come from a family of lunatics... [a]ctual, raving lunatics." He stated that his mother "is a paranoid schizophrenic. She insisted that Jake had somehow been molested by his father while he was still in the womb". He was taken away from his mother by his aunt when he was 6. Two years later, he was placed in a children's home in Sonoma County. At age 10, his indigent father was awarded custody of him. Having been introduced to computer programming by a friend's father, Appelbaum said, saved his life. "The Internet is the only reason I'm alive today."&lt;ref name="roll2010"/&gt;

{{As of|2015|9|1}}, Appelbaum is a Ph.D. student studying under [[Tanja Lange]] and [[Daniel J. Bernstein]] at the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]].&lt;ref name="phd_eindhoven" /&gt;

== Career ==

=== Journalism ===
Appelbaum was among several people to gain access to former NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]]'s [[top secret]] documents [[global surveillance disclosure|released in 2013]].&lt;ref name="breakin"/&gt; He has contributed extensively as a journalist to the publication of those documents.

On 23 October 2013, Appelbaum and other writers and editors at ''Der Spiegel'' reported that their investigations had led German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] to confront the U.S. government over evidence that it was monitoring her personal cell phone.&lt;ref name="Spiegel Merkel Phone"&gt;

The former covered his travels to [[Iraq]]—crossing the border by foot, the installing of Internet satellites in [[Kurdistan]], and his visit of [[New Orleans]] post-[[Hurricane Katrina]]. The latter talk discussed the legal and technical aspects of [[full disk encryption]]. At the 2006 23rd Chaos Communication Congress, he gave a talk with Ralf-Philipp Weinmann titled ''Unlocking FileVault: An Analysis of Apple's Encrypted Disk Storage System''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1642.en.html |title=Unlocking FileVault: An analysis of Apple's encrypted disk storage system |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Jade |date=December 2006 |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2006/12/6436.ars |title=FileVault or VileFault? |work=[[Ars Technica]] | accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duo subsequently released the VileFault [[free software]] program which broke [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[FileVault]] security.

Appelbaum regards [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] as a "part of an ecosystem of software that helps people regain and reclaim their autonomy. It helps to enable people to have agency of all kinds; it helps others to help each other and it helps you to help yourself. It runs, it is open and it is supported by a large community spread across all walks of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/11/4091186/interview-uncut-jacob-appelbaum |title=Interview uncut: Jacob Appelbaum &amp;#124; The Verge Forums |publisher=Theverge.com |date=11 March 2013 |accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
[[File:Jacob Appelbaum, Freiheit statt Angst 2013.jpg|thumb|Appelbaum talks at the protest march, [[Freiheit statt Angst|Freedom not fear]], in Berlin (2013).]]

Appelbaum represented Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in a keynote address at the 2010 [[Hackers on Planet Earth|HOPE]] conference. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents were planning to detain him after his talk, but organizers slipped him out through an alternative exit in disguise.&lt;ref name="roll2010"/&gt;

In August 2013, Appelbaum delivered Edward Snowden's acceptance speech after he was awarded the biannual Whistleblower Prize by a group of NGOs at the [[Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities]].&lt;ref name="heise-1922132"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Whistleblower-Preis-fuer-Edward-Snowden-1922132.html |title=Whistleblower-Preis für Edward Snowden |accessdate=25 July 2013 |author=Detlef Borchers |date=23 July 2013 |website=[[Heise online]] |archivedate=25 July 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IMvcdV8q?url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Whistleblower-Preis-fuer-Edward-Snowden-1922132.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Snowden: [http://www.zeit.de/digital/datenschutz/2013-09/edward-snowden-whistleblower-preis-rede/komplettansicht ''Die Wahrheit auszusprechen, hat Whistleblower ihre Freiheit gekostet'' - the acceptance speech in English and German], ''Die Zeit'', 3 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surveillance, airport detention, and WikiLeaks investigation===
Appelbaum believes he has been under government surveillance since 2009, to the detriment of himself, his friends, and his close relations.&lt;ref name="exberliner.com"&gt;[http://www.exberliner.com/features/people/jacob-appelbaum-on-the-usa-and-nsa/ Nadja Vancauwenberghe, "Jacob Appelbaum: Revolutionary times", Exberliner, 22 September 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;  In interviews he has stated that living in Germany has given him a sense of relief from U.S. surveillance.&lt;ref name="motherboard.vice.com"&gt;[http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/jacob-appelbaum-utopia-interview John Lubbock, "Jacob Appelbaum's Utopia", Vice News, 6 October 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195151/http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/jacob-appelbaum-utopia-interview |date=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Appelbaum has described various aggressive surveillance events, and implies they are related to his work with Wikileaks, to his privacy activism, and to relationships with other privacy activists, notably reporters linked to [[Edward Snowden]].&lt;ref name="exberliner.com" /&gt; In December 2013, Appelbaum said he suspected the U.S. government of breaking into his Berlin apartment.&lt;ref name="breakin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Snowden ally Appelbaum claims his Berlin apartment was invaded |url=http://www.dw.de/snowden-ally-appelbaum-claims-his-berlin-apartment-was-invaded/a-17315069|website=[[Deutsche Welle]]|accessdate=29 November 2014|date=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While traveling, Appelbaum has been detained at airports and had his electronic equipment seized several times.&lt;ref name="DemocracyNow2"&gt;Democracy Now!: [http://www.democracynow.org/2012/4/20/we_do_not_live_in_a "We Don’t Live in a Free Country": Jacob Appelbaum on Being Target of Widespread Gov’t Surveillance |Democracy Now!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AppelbaumAirport&gt;{{cite news |first=Elinor |last=Mills |title=Researcher detained at U.S. border, questioned about Wikileaks |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20012253-245.html |publisher=[[CNET Networks|CNET News]] |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Xeni |last=Jardin |title=Wikileaks volunteer detained and searched (again) by US agents |url=http://www.boingboing.net/2011/01/12/wikileaks-volunteer-1.html |newspaper=[[Boing Boing]] |date=12 January 2011 |accessdate=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Fontain |title=Jacob Appelbaum Detained At Keflavík Airport |url=http://grapevine.is/News/ReadArticle/Jacob-Appelbaum-Detained-At-Keflavik-Airport |newspaper=[[Grapevine]] |date=27 October 2011 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[US Department of Justice]] obtained a [[Twitter subpoena|court order compelling Twitter]] to provide data associated with the user accounts of Appelbaum, as well as several other individuals associated with WikiLeaks. While the order was originally sealed, Twitter successfully petitioned the court to unseal it, permitting the company to inform its users that their account information had been requested.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now (1)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Declan |last=McCullagh |title=DOJ sends order to Twitter for Wikileaks-related account info |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20027893-281.html |publisher=[[CNET Networks|CNET News]] |date=7 January 2011 |accessdate=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, he testified before the [[European Parliament]], mentioning that his partner had been spied on by men in [[night vision device|night-vision goggles]] as she slept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu6accTBjfs&amp;t=2h23m1s |title=NSA Hearing European Parliament |time=2:23:01 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=12 July 2016 |date=5 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Appelbaum told [[Berliner Zeitung]] that he believes he was under surveillance and that somebody broke into his Berlin apartment and used his computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dw.de/snowden-ally-appelbaum-claims-his-berlin-apartment-was-invaded/a-17315069 |title=Snowden ally Appelbaum claims his Berlin apartment was invaded |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=21 December 2013 |accessdate=12 July 2016 |agency=AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Allegations of sexual misconduct ==
In March 2015, Appelbaum was suspended from his position at the Tor Project for ten days due to alleged incidents of harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Andy|title=Tor Developer Jacob Appelbaum Resigns Amid Sex Abuse Claims|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/06/tor-developer-jacob-appelbaum-resigns-amid-sex-abuse-claims/|website=Wired|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=19 June 2016|date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein-2016-06-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gierow-2016-06-08"/&gt;

In July 2016 the Tor Project announced it had completed a seven-week investigation led by a hired investigator. According to Shari Steele, Tor Project "did everything in our power" to treat Mr. Appelbaum fairly, but "we determined that the allegations against him appear to be true." According to her summary of the investigation, which was not released, "many people inside and outside the Tor Project have reported incidents of being humiliated, intimidated, bullied, and frightened" by Jacob Appelbaum, and that "several experienced unwanted sexually aggressive behavior from him." Steele made no mention of rape claims published on the anonymous website.&lt;ref name="'Sam' and 'Forest' Reveal Identities" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Unwanted Sexual Advances Described" /&gt; Steele alleged that two other unnamed individuals had also been involved in inappropriate behavior are no longer part of the project.&lt;ref name="Allegations Were Accurate" /&gt; Among other changes, Steele stated that an anti-harassment policy has been drafted.&lt;ref name="Many Reported Being Humilated by Appelbaum"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/07/tor-inquiry-many-people-reported-being-humiliated-by-appelbaum/ | title=Tor inquiry: "Many people" reported being "humiliated" by Appelbaum: Going forward, group will now have a new anti-harassment policy, among other changes | publisher=Ars Technica | date=27 July 2016 | accessdate=27 July 2016 | author=Farivar, Cyrus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article also reports that a second falsely identified victim had demanded that her story be removed from the anonymous website.&lt;ref name="Die Zeit Contradictions-English" /&gt;

As of August 2016 the affair was the cause of considerable dissent within the Tor community, with calls for a one-day Tor strike being issued via [[GitHub]] (and later on [[Twitter]] with the [[hashtag]] #TorStrike).

A '''khanate''' or '''khaganate''' is a political entity ruled by a [[Khan (title)|khan]] or [[Khagan|khagan]]. This political entity is typical for people from the [[Eurasian Steppe]] and it can be equivalent to [[tribe|tribal]] [[chiefdom]], [[principality]], [[monarchy|kingdom]] or [[empire]].

== Mongol khanates (or khaganates) ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7179">The '''Lang Labor Party''' was a [[political party]] active in [[South Australia]] from 1931 to 1934, aligned with [[Lang Labor]] and the policies of [[Premier of New South Wales]] [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]].

==Establishment==
It was formed as a result of increasing tensions within the [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)|Australian Labor Party]] over the party's economic response to the [[Great Depression in Australia]]. The opponents of austerity in the Labor Party, of which Lang was among the most prominent figures, had supported repudiating Australia's debt, while supporters of austerity policies would subsequently introduce the national "[[Premiers' Plan]]" to achieve those ends. The [[Australian Labor Party split of 1931|1931 Labor split]] occurred both at a state and federal level, with Lang's supporters being known as "[[Lang Labor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/scullin/in-office.aspx#section2 | title=In office | publisher=National Archives of Australia | work=Scullin | accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 1931, the "Lang Plan Campaign Committee" had been formed in South Australia to give publicity to and campaign for Lang's ideas. Its members were not, at its inception, outside the Labor Party; however, the breach between Lang's supporters and the mainstream party quickly broadened, and reports that month suggested that a split in the party was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45765943 |title=CLEAVAGE IN LABOR PARTY. |newspaper=[[Advertiser and Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=12 May 1931 |accessdate=27 March 2015 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45765645 |title=Plea for Loyalty to Labor Policy. |newspaper=[[Advertiser and Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=11 May 1931 |accessdate=27 March 2015 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee's president was [[Doug Bardolph]], and its secretary was [[Tom Howard (politician)|Tom Howard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128934572 |title=Lang Candidate for Adelaide Seat Unlikely. |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]] |location=Adelaide |date=9 July 1931 |accessdate=27 March 2015 |page=7 Edition: HOME EDITION |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article35675285 |title=N.S.W.

==South Australian Lang Labor Party (SALLP)==
Two of the three Lang Labor Party MHAs elected at the [[South Australian state election, 1933|1933 state election]], [[Bob Dale (politician)|Bob Dale]] and [[Tom Howard (politician)|Tom Howard]], left the party in 1933 post-election after falling out with leader [[Doug Bardolph]] and formed their own party, the South Australian Lang Labor Party (SALLP).

In June 1934 the four Labor factions were reunited.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="734">The '''Act on the acquisition of land for settlement purposes''' ({{lang-fi|Laki maan hankkimisesta asutustarkoituksiin (278/1922)}}) or '''Lex Kallio''' was a 1922 [[Finnish law]], nicknamed after its proponent [[Kyösti Kallio]], who later served as the [[President of Finland]]. The key provision was in its section 2, where it was provided that the State and local authorities would facilitate the acquisition of land for Finnish citizens wishing to do so for the purposes of cultivation and residential settlement. The law was repealed in 1938.

=== Key ===
; Seats per district : Most elections are split into a number of [[electoral district]]s.  In some elections, there is one person elected per district. In others, there are many people elected per district.  Electoral districts can have different names, see [[list of electoral districts by nation]].
; Total number of seats : the number of representatives elected to the body in total.
; Election threshold : see [[Election threshold]]
; [[Plurality voting system|FPTP]] : Using the system of First Past The Post voting to pick a single winner per district
; [[Party-list proportional representation|Party list]] : One of many [[Party-list proportional representation]] systems.  Where possible, this has been replaced by the allocation system used within the party-list (e.g. [[D'Hondt method]])
; [[Parallel voting]] : This means that two simultaneous systems are used to elect representatives to the same body.  If there is interchange between the two systems (e.g. the number elected in one system affects the number elected in the other) then this is called  the [[additional member system]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1520">The '''National Culture Policy''' introduced in 1970 in [[Malaysia]], emphasized an assimilation of the non-Malays into the [[Malay people|Malay]] ethnic group. However, during the 1990s Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] rejected this approach, with his ''[[Bangsa Malaysia]]'' policy emphasising a Malaysian instead of Malay identity for the state.

Malaysian National Culture Policy is defined in the "1971 National Culture Policy". &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johorebar.org.my/content/view/102/27/ 1971 National Culture Policy]&lt;/ref&gt; It defines 3 principles as guidelines for 'national culture':
# The National Culture must be based on the indigenous [Malay] culture
# Suitable elements from the other cultures may be accepted as part of the national culture
# Islam is an important component in the moulding of the '''National''' Culture.

The main objectives of this policy was to:

* Restore, preserve and develop culture towards strengthening national culture through joint research, development , education and cultural expansion and connections.
* Increase and strengthen  cultural  leadership through training and guidance to interested individuals. Support and mobilize culture as an effective engine of growth.
* Establish effective communication to instill national awareness and Malaysian nationalism.
* Fulfill  socio-cultural needs.
* Improve the standard and quality of arts.

The '''Oath ''More Judaico''''' or '''Jewish Oath''' was a special form of [[oath]], rooted in antisemitsm and accompanied by certain ceremonies and often intentionally humiliating, painful or dangerous, that Jews were required to take in [[Europe]]an [[court]]s of [[law]] until the 20th century. ''More Judaico'' is [[Latin]] for "on/by the Jewish custom." The question of the trustworthiness of the Jewish oath was intimately connected with the meaning that [[Christian]] authorities assigned to the ''[[Kol Nidre]]'' prayer, recited by Jews on [[Yom Kippur]], and the whole of the legislation regarding the oath was characteristic of the [[Jews in the Middle Ages|attitude of medieval states toward their Jewish subjects]]. The [[Separation of church and state#History|identification of Church and State]] seemed to render it necessary to have a different formula for those outside the state church.

==Historical development==
The [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disability]] imposed on a [[Jew]] engaged in legal contention with a [[Christian]] dates back to [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]], who declared that neither Jews nor [[heresy|heretics]] should be admitted as [[witness]]es against Christians;  [[Secularism|secular]] courts, however, did not recognize this disability. Thus, in the safe conducts issued by the [[Carolingian]] kings in the 9th century, Jews and Christians were treated as equals, and consequently the [[testimony]] of the former, whether given under [[oath]] or not, was as admissible as the latter. This was distinctly stated in the [[charter]] granted by [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] to the Jews of [[Speyer]] in 1090. The law of [[Duke]] [[Frederick II of Austria]] (1244), which served as a model for much other [[legislation]] on the Jews, merely required a Jew to [[oath|swear]] "super Rodal" (by the [[Torah]]). Similar laws existed in [[England]], [[Portugal]], and [[Hungary]]; Hungary waived the requirement to swear on the [[Torah]] in trivial cases.

There were, however, some older laws that prescribed certain practices intended to mock Jews in court. These examples illustrated the kinds of humiliating rituals that accompanied the taking of the oath:
*[[Byzantine Empire]], 10th century: the Jew would wear a [[Crown of thorns|girdle of thorns]] around his loins, stand in water, and swear by "Barase Baraa" ([[Book of Genesis|Bereshit Bara]]), so that if he spoke untruth, he would be swallowed by the earth just like [[Dathan]] and [[Abiram]] in [[Book_of_Numbers#Chapter_15-17|Numbers 16:1–27]].
*[[Arles]] (c. 1150): a wreath of thorns would be hung on the swearer's neck, others would grovel at his knees, and a thorn branch five [[ell]]s in length would be pulled "between his loins" while he swore and called down upon himself all the [[Curse#Curses in the Bible|curses]] of the Torah.
*[[Swabia]] (13th century): the Jew would stand on the hide of a [[Unclean animals|sow]] or a [[Lamb of God|bloody lamb]].
*[[Silesia]] (1422): the Jew would stand on a three-legged stool and have to pay a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] each time he fell, finally losing his [[legal case|case]] if he fell four times.
*[[Dortmund]]: the Jew would be fined each time he halted in repeating the oath.
*[[Vrbové]], Hungary (1517): the Jew would stand barefooted and swear with his face turned to the east, holding the [[Pentateuch]] in his hand.
*[[Breslau]] (c. 1455): the Jew would stand [[Yarmulke#Purpose|bareheaded]] and pronounce the name of [[Yahweh]].

==An example: Frankfurt oath==
[[File:Oathmorejudaico.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A 17th century drawing of a German Jew taking a Jewish oath.]]
The following formula, originally in Middle High German, was used in Frankfurt on the Main about 1392:[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/jewish/1392-jews-frankfort.html]
:''The Jew shall stand on a sow's skin and the five books of Master Moses shall lie before him, and his right hand up to the wrist shall lie on the book and he shall repeat after him who administers the oath of the Jews:''

:''Regarding such property of which the man accuses you, you know nothing of it, nor do you have it. You never had it in your possession, you do not have it in any of your chests, you have not buried it in the earth, nor locked it with locks, so help you God who created heaven and earth, valley and hill, woods, trees, and grass, and so help you the law which God himself created and wrote with His own hand and gave Moses on Sinai's mount. And so help you the five books of Moses that you may nevermore enjoy a bite without soiling yourself all over as did the King of Babylon.''

:''And may that sulphur and pitch flow down upon your neck that flowed over Sodom and Gomorrah, and the same pitch that flowed over Babylon flow over you, but two hundred times more, and may the earth envelop and swallow you up as it did Dathan and Abiram. And may your dust never join other dust, and your earth never join other earth in the bosom of Master Abraham if what you say is not true and right.'' [This refers either to a decent burial or to resurrection.] ''And so help you Adonai, you have sworn the truth.''

:''If not, may you become as leprous as Naaman and Gehazi, and may the calamity strike you that the Israelite people escaped as they journeyed forth from Egypt's land. And may a bleeding and a flowing come forth from you and never cease, as your people wished upon themselves when they condemned God, Jesus Christ, among themselves, and tortured Him and said: {{bibleref|Matthew|27:25}} "His blood be upon us and our children." It is true, so help you God who appeared to Moses in a burning bush which yet remained unconsumed. It is true by the oath that you have sworn, by the soul which you bring on the Day of Judgment before the Court, [before the God of] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is true, so help you God and the oath you have sworn. [Amen].''

==The oath as a Jewish disability==
A decidedly aggressive change took place when, in 1555, the [[Germany|German]] imperial court procedure (''Reichskammergerichtsordnung'') prescribed a form of oath that, with some alterations, formed a model to subsequent legislation. Horrible were the terms in which the swearer called down upon himself all the curses of [[Leviticus]] and [[Deuteronomy]], the [[ten plagues]] of [[Egypt]], the [[leprosy]] of [[Naaman]] and [[Gehazi]] (see 2 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 5), the fate of Dathan and Abiram, etc.

According to a recount in his "Gesammelte Schriften," the great German-Jewish philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] persuaded the [[Prussia]]n government to moderate the terms of the oath during the 18th century. The small German states gradually surrendered the most objectionable features of the oath: [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), in 1828; [[Oldenburg]], 1829; [[Württemberg]], 1832; [[Saxony]], 1839 (on which occasion [[Zecharias Frankel]] published his famous "Die Eidesleistung"); [[Schaumburg-Lippe]] and [[Anhalt]]-[[Bernburg]], 1842; and [[Hesse-Homburg]], 1865. 

Prussia retained the obnoxious formula until March 15, 1869; the [[Netherlands]] modified the oath in 1818, and [[Russia]] in 1838 and 1860. The Jewish [[advocate]] [[Isaac Adolphe Crémieux]] won great fame by effecting the abolition of the oath through a case brought before the court of [[Nîmes]] in 1827. [[Lazard Isidor]], as [[rabbi]] of [[Pfalzburg]], refused in 1839 to open the [[synagogue]] for such an oath; prosecuted for [[contempt of court]], he was defended by Crémieux and acquitted. The French Supreme Court finally declared the oath [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]] on March 3, 1846. However, as late as 1902, a court in [[Romania]] upheld that country's version of the oath.

{{Executive}}
A '''parliamentary system''' is a system of [[democracy|democratic]] [[government|governance]] of a [[sovereign state|state]] where the [[Executive (government)|executive]] derives its democratic legitimacy from its ability to command the confidence of the [[legislature]],  typically a [[parliament]], and is also held accountable to that parliament. In a parliamentary system, the [[head of state]] is usually a person distinct from the [[head of government]]. This is in contrast to a [[presidential system]], where the head of state often is also the head of government and, most importantly, the executive does not derive its democratic legitimacy from the legislature.

Countries with parliamentary democracies may be [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], where a [[monarch]] is the head of state while the head of government is almost always a [[member of parliament]] (such as the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden and Japan), or [[parliamentary republic]]s, where a mostly ceremonial president is the head of state while the head of government is regularly from the legislature (such as Ireland, Germany, India and Italy). In a few parliamentary republics, such as Botswana, South Africa, and Suriname, among [[List of countries by system of government#Mixed republican systems|some others]], the head of government is also head of state, but is elected by and is answerable to parliament. In [[bicameral legislature|bicameral]] parliaments, the head of government is generally, though not always, a member of the lower house.

[[Parliamentarianism]] is the dominant [[form of government]] in Europe, with 32 of its [[List of European countries|50 sovereign states]] being parliamentarian. It is also common in the [[Caribbean]], being the form of government of 10 of its 13 island states, and in Oceania. Elsewhere in the world, parliamentary countries are less common, but they are distributed through all continents, most often in former colonies of the [[British Empire]].

==History==
{{Further|History of Parliamentarism}}

Since ancient times, when societies were tribal, there were councils or a headman whose decisions were assessed by village elders. Eventually, these councils have slowly evolved into the modern parliamentary system.

The first [[parliament]]s date back to Europe in the Middle Ages in Greece, specifically in 1188 Alfonso IX, King of Leon (Spain) convened the three states in the [[Cortes of León]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-decreta-of-leon-of-1188-the-oldest-documentary-manifestation-of-the-european-parliamentary-system/|title=The Decreta of León of 1188 - The oldest documentary manifestation of the European parliamentary system|publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World|date=2013|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Keane: ''The Life and Death of Democracy'', London 2009, 169-176.&lt;/ref&gt; An early example of parliamentary government developed in today's Netherlands and Belgium during the [[Dutch revolt]] (1581), when the sovereign, legislative and executive powers were taken over by the [[States General of the Netherlands]] from the then-monarch, [[King Philip II of Spain]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The modern concept of parliamentary government emerged in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Kingdom of Great Britain between 1707–1800]] and its contemporary, the [[Age of Liberty|Parliamentary System in Sweden between 1721–1772]].

In England, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] is remembered as one of the fathers of [[representative government]] for holding two famous parliaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jobson|first1=Adrian|title=The First English Revolution: Simon de Montfort, Henry III and the Barons' War|date=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-1-84725-226-5|pages=173–4|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9gHWamp-TLoC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAhdzLi7LMAhWJUhQKHUt3BzUQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Simon de Montfort: The turning point for democracy that gets overlooked|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30849472|accessdate=19 January 2015|publisher=BBC| postscript = none|date=19 January 2015}}; {{cite news|title=The January Parliament and how it defined Britain|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11355822/The-January-Parliament-and-how-it-defined-Britain.html|accessdate=28 January 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxford Parliament (1258)|The first]], in 1258, stripped the King of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included [[Simon de Montfort's Parliament|ordinary citizens from the towns]].&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite DNB |last=Norgate |first=Kate |authorlink=Kate Norgate |wstitle=Montfort, Simon of (1208?-1265)|volume=38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the 17th century, the [[Parliament of England]] pioneered some of the ideas and systems of [[Liberal democracy#Origins|liberal democracy]] culminating in the [[Glorious Revolution]] and passage of the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kopstein|editor1-first=Jeffrey|editor2-last=Lichbach|editor2-first=Mark|editor3-last=Hanson|editor3-first=Stephen E.|title=Comparative Politics: Interests, Identities, and Institutions in a Changing Global Order|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1139991388|pages=37–9|edition=4, revised|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L2jwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIwsWGi6jMAhWJK8AKHQfJCy4Q6AEIKzAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=Britain pioneered the system of liberal democracy that has now spread in one form or another to most of the world's countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=refIIP&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitutionalism: America &amp; Beyond|url=http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html|publisher=Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP), U.S. Department of State|accessdate=30 October 2014|quote=The earliest, and perhaps greatest, victory for liberalism was achieved in England. The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The "rights of man" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024130317/http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], the monarch, in theory, chaired cabinet and chose ministers. In practice, King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]'s inability to speak English led the responsibility for chairing cabinet to go to the leading minister, literally the ''[[Prime minister|prime]]'' or first minister, [[Robert Walpole]]. The gradual democratisation of parliament with the broadening of the voting franchise increased parliament's role in controlling government, and in deciding who the king could ask to form a government. By the nineteenth-century, the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832 led to parliamentary dominance, with its choice ''invariably'' deciding who was prime minister and the complexion of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Institution of Prime Minister|url=https://history.blog.gov.uk/2012/01/01/the-institution-of-prime-minister/|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom: History of Government Blog|accessdate=15 April 2016|date=1 January 2012|author=Dr Andrew Blick and Professor George Jones — No 10 guest historian series, Prime Ministers and No. 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Byrum E.|title=Office of the Prime Minister|date=2015|origyear=1955|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400878260|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ez7WCgAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|chapter=The Historical Development of the Office of Prime Minister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries gradually adopted what came to be called the [[Westminster Model]] of government, with an executive answerable to parliament, but exercising powers nominally vested in the head of state, in the name of the head of state. Hence the use of phrases like ''Her Majesty's government'' or ''His Excellency's government''. Such a system became particularly prevalent in older British dominions, many of whom had their constitutions enacted by the British parliament; examples include Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the [[Irish Free State]] and the [[Union of South Africa]]. Some of these parliaments evolved were reformed from, or were initially developed as distinct from their original British model: the [[Australian Senate]], for instance, has since its inception more closely reflected the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] than the British [[House of Lords]]; whereas since 1950 there is no upper house in New Zealand.

[[Democracy]] and [[parliamentarism|parliamentarianism]] became increasingly prevalent in Europe in the years after [[World War I]], partially imposed by the democratic victors, Great Britain and France, on the defeated countries and their successors, notably [[Weimar Germany|Germany's Weimar Republic]] and the new Austrian Republic. Nineteenth-century [[urbanisation]], the [[Industrial Revolution]] and, [[modernism]]  had already fuelled the political left's struggle for democracy and parliamentarianism for a long time. In the radicalised times at the end of World War I, democratic reforms were often seen as a means to counter popular revolutionary currents.

{{Further|Parliamentary procedure}}
A parliamentary system may be either [[bicameralism|bicameral]], with two [[chambers of parliament]] (or houses) or [[unicameralism|unicameral]], with just one parliamentary chamber. In the case of a bicameral parliament, this is usually characterised by an elected [[lower house]] that has the power to determine the executive government and an [[upper house]] which may be appointed or elected through a different mechanism from the lower house.

Scholars of democracy such as [[Arend Lijphart]] distinguish two types of parliamentary democracies: the Westminster and Consensus systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Lijphart |first=Arend |year=1999 |title=Patterns of democracy |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Westminster system]] is usually found in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and countries which were influenced by the British political tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Arjomand|editor1-first=Saïd Amir|title=Constitutionalism and political reconstruction|date=2007|publisher=Brill|isbn=9004151745|pages=92–94|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kYmmnYKEvE0C&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;ots=nOUN11pmfK&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author1=Julian Go|chapter=A Globalizing Constitutionalism?, Views from the Postcolony, 1945-2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Westminster Parliamentary System was exported around the World|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/how-the-westminster-parliamentary-system-was-exported-around-the-world|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=16 December 2013|date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seidle|first1=F.

Some parliaments in this model are elected using a [[plurality voting system]] ([[first past the post]]), such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and India, while others use [[proportional representation]], such as Ireland and New Zealand. The [[Australian House of Representatives]] is elected using [[instant-runoff voting]], while the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] is elected using proportional representation through [[single transferable vote]]. Regardless of which system is used, the voting systems tend to allow the voter to vote for a named candidate rather than a [[closed list]].
* The Western European parliamentary model (e.g. Spain, Germany) tends to have a more consensual debating system and usually has semi-circular debating chambers. Consensus systems have more of a tendency to use [[proportional representation]] with [[open party list]]s than the Westminster Model legislatures. The committees of these Parliaments tend to be more important than the [[plenary chamber]]. Some West European countries' parliaments (e.g. in the [[Parliament of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Chamber of Deputies (Luxembourg)|Luxembourg]] and [[Parliament of Sweden|Sweden]]) implement the principle of [[dualism (politics)|dualism]] as a form of separation of powers. In countries using this system, Members of Parliament have to resign their place in Parliament upon being appointed (or elected) minister. Ministers in those countries usually actively participate in parliamentary debates, but, are not entitled to vote.

Implementations of the parliamentary system can also differ on the manner of how the prime minister and government are appointed and as to whether the government needs the explicit approval of the parliament, rather than just the absence of its disapproval. Some countries such as India also require the prime minister to be a member of the legislature, though in other countries this only exists as a convention.
* '''The head of state appoints a prime minister who will likely have majority support in parliament'''. While in practice most prime ministers under the [[Westminster system]] (including Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand and the United Kingdom) are the leaders of the largest party in parliament, technically the appointment of the prime minister is a prerogative exercised by the monarch, the governor-general, or the president. No parliamentary vote takes place on who is forming a government, but since parliament can immediately defeat the government with a [[motion of no confidence]], the head of state is limited by convention to choosing a candidate who can command the confidence of parliament, and thus has little or no influence in the decision.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* '''The head of state appoints a prime minister who must gain a vote of confidence within a set time.''' Examples: Italy, Thailand.
* '''The head of state appoints the leader of the political party holding a plurality of seats in parliament as prime minister'''. For example, in Greece, if no party has a majority, the leader of the party with a plurality of seats is given an ''exploratory mandate'' to receive the confidence of the parliament within three days. If this is not possible, then the leader of the party with the second highest seat number is given the ''exploratory mandate''. If this fails, then the leader of the third largest party is given it and so on.
* '''The head of state ''nominates'' a candidate for prime minister who is then submitted to parliament for approval before appointment.''' Example: Spain, where the King sends a nomination to parliament for approval. Also, Germany where under the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic Law]] (constitution) the [[Bundestag]] votes on a candidate nominated by the federal president. In these cases, parliament can choose another candidate who then would be appointed by the head of state.
* '''Parliament ''nominates'' a candidate whom the head of state is constitutionally obliged to appoint as prime minister.''' Example: Japan, where the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] appoints the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] on the nomination of the [[National Diet|Diet]]. Also, Ireland where the [[President of Ireland]] appoints the [[Taoiseach]] on the nomination of the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]].
* '''A public officeholder (other than the head of state or their representative) ''nominates'' a candidate, who, if approved by parliament, is appointed as prime minister.''' Example: Under the Swedish [[Instrument of Government (1974)]], the power to appoint someone to form a government has been moved from the monarch to the Speaker of Parliament and the parliament itself. The speaker nominates a candidate, who is then elected to prime minister (''statsminister'') by the parliament if an absolute majority of the members of parliament does not vote no (i.e. he can be elected even if more members of parliament vote ''No'' than ''Yes).''
* '''Direct election by popular vote.''' Example: Israel, 1996–2001, where the prime minister was elected in a general election, with no regard to political affiliation, and whose procedure can also be described as of a [[semi-parliamentary system]].&lt;ref name="Pouvoirs"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Duverger |first=Maurice |author-link=Maurice Duverger |date=September 1996 |title=Les monarchies républicaines |trans-title=The crowned republics |url=http://www.revue-pouvoirs.fr/IMG/pdf/78Pouvoirs_p107-120_monarchies_republicaines.pdf |format=PDF |language=French |magazine=[[Pouvoirs, revue française d’études constitutionnelles et politiques]] |location=Paris |publisher=Éditions du Seuil |issn= 0152-0768 |isbn=2-02-030123-7 |issue=78 |pages=107–120 |access-date=10 September 2016 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forms"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frosini |first1=Justin Orlando |year=2008 |editor-last=Ferrari |editor-first=Giuseppe Franco |title=Forms of State and Forms of Government |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GFBPlYjuJYsC&amp;printsec=frontcover |location= |publisher=Giuffrè Editore |pages=54–55 |isbn=9788814143885 |access-date=13 November 2016 |via=[[Google Books]] |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, there are variations as to what conditions exist (if any) for the government to have the right to dissolve the parliament:
* In some countries, such as Denmark, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand, the prime minister has the de facto power to call an election, at will. This was also the case in the United Kingdom until the passage of the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]].
* In Israel, parliament may vote in order to call an election or pass a vote of no confidence against the government.
* Other countries only permit an election to be called in the event of a [[vote of no confidence]] against the government, a supermajority vote in favour of an early election or prolonged deadlock in parliament. These requirements can still be circumvented. For example, in Germany in 2005, [[Gerhard Schröder]] deliberately allowed his government to lose a confidence motion, in order to call an early election.
* In Sweden, the government may call a snap election at will, but the newly elected [[Riksdag]] is only elected to fill out the previous Riksdag's term. The last time this option was used was in [[Swedish general election, 1958|1958]].
* Norway is unique among parliamentary systems in that the [[Storting]] always serves the whole of its four-year term.

The parliamentary system can be contrasted with a [[presidential system]] which operates under a stricter separation of powers, whereby the executive does not form part of—nor is appointed by—the parliamentary or legislative body. In such a system, parliaments or congresses do not select or dismiss heads of governments, and governments cannot request an early dissolution as may be the case for parliaments. There also exists the [[semi-presidential system]] that draws on both presidential systems and parliamentary systems by combining a powerful president with an executive responsible to parliament, for example, the [[French Fifth Republic]].

parliamentarianism may also apply to [[Regional government|regional]] and [[local government]]s. An example is the city of [[Oslo]], which has an executive council (Byråd) as a part of the parliamentary system.

A few parliamentary democratic nations such as India,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nujslawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/kartik-khanna-and-dhvani-shah.pdf|title=ANTI-DEFECTION LAW: A DEATH KNELL FOR PARLIAMENTARY DISSENT?|journal=NUJS Law Review|date=Mar 2012|pmid=|access-date=15 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528062743/http://nujslawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/kartik-khanna-and-dhvani-shah.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan, and Bangladesh, have enacted an [[anti-defection law]], which prohibits a member of the legislature from switching to another party after being elected. With this law, elected representatives lose their seats in parliament if they vote contrary to the directions of their party.

One of the commonly attributed advantages to parliamentary systems is that it is faster and easier to pass legislation,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| author=T. St. John N. Bates| year=1986| place=Oxford| title=Parliament, Policy and Delegated Power| publisher=Oxford University Press| journal=Statute Law Review |url=http://slr.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/7/2/114.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the executive branch is formed by the direct or indirect support of the legislative branch and often includes members of the legislature. Thus the executive (as the majority party or coalition of parties in the legislature) has a majority of the votes and can pass legislation at will. In a presidential system, the executive is often chosen independently from the legislature. If the executive and the majority of the legislature are from different [[political parties]], then stalemate can occur. Thus the executive might not be able to implement its legislative proposals. An executive in any system (be it parliamentary, presidential or semi-presidential) is chiefly voted into office on the basis of his or her party's platform/manifesto,{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;!-- this isn't true of the US at least --&gt; and the same is also true of the legislature.

In addition to quicker legislative action, a parliamentary government has attractive features for nations that are [[ethnicity|ethnically]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|racially]], or [[ideology|ideologically]] divided. In a presidential system, all executive power is vested in one person: the president. In a parliamentary system, with a collegial executive, power is more divided. In the 1989 Lebanese [[Taif Agreement]], in order to give [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslims]] greater political power, Lebanon moved from a [[semi-presidential system]] with a strong president{{Dubious|Lebanon|date=December 2015}} to a system more structurally similar to classical parliamentary government. Iraq similarly disdained a presidential system out of fears that such a system would be tantamount to [[Shiite]] domination; Afghanistan's minorities refused to go along with a presidency as strong as the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] desired.

It can also be argued that power is more evenly spread out in parliamentary government, as the government and prime minister do not have the ability to make unilateral decisions as the entire government cabinet is answerable and accountable to parliament. Parliamentary systems are less likely to allow celebrity-based politics to fully dominate a society unlike what often happens in presidential systems, where name-recall and popularity can catapult a celebrity, actor, or popular politician to the presidency despite such candidate's lack of competence and experience.

In his 1867 book ''[[The English Constitution]]'', [[Walter Bagehot]] praised parliamentary governments for producing serious debates, for allowing for a change in power without an election, and for allowing elections at any time. Bagehot considered the four-year election rule of the United States to be unnatural, as it can potentially allow a president who has disappointed the public with a dismal performance in the second year of his term to continue on until the end of his 4-year term. Under a parliamentary system, a prime minister that has lost support in the middle of his term can be easily replaced by his own peers.

Some scholars like [[Juan Linz]], [[Frederick Charles Riggs|Fred Riggs]], [[Bruce Ackerman]], and [[Robert Dahl]] have found that parliamentary government is less prone to authoritarian collapse. These scholars point out that since [[World War II]], two-thirds of [[Third World]] countries establishing parliamentary governments successfully made the transition to democracy. By contrast, no Third World presidential system successfully made the transition to democracy without experiencing [[coup]]s and other constitutional breakdowns.

A recent [[World Bank]] study found that parliamentary systems are associated with less corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=632777 Lederman, Daniel; Loayza, Norman; Soares, Rodrigo. "Accountability and Corruption: Political Institutions Matter"]&lt;/ref&gt; This study's findings are supported by a separate study that arrived at the same conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.bu.edu/jgerring/documents/Corruption.pdf Gerring, John; Thacker, Strom. "Political Institutions and Corruption"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some constituencies may have a popular local candidate under an unpopular leader (or the reverse), forcing a difficult choice on the electorate. [[Mixed-member proportional representation]] (where voters cast two votes) can make this choice easier by allowing voters to cast one vote for the local candidate at the constituency level but also cast a second vote for another party at the wider parliamentary level.

Although Bagehot praised parliamentary governments for allowing an election to take place at any time, the lack of a definite election calendar can be abused. Previously under some systems, such as the British, a ruling party could schedule elections when it felt that it was likely to retain power, and so avoid elections at times of unpopularity. (Election timing in the UK, however, is now partly fixed under the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]].) Thus, by a wise timing of elections, in a parliamentary system, a party can extend its rule for longer than is feasible in a functioning presidential system. This problem can be alleviated somewhat by setting fixed dates for parliamentary elections, as is the case in several of Australia's state parliaments. In other systems, such as the Dutch and the Belgian, the ruling party or coalition has some flexibility in determining the election date. Conversely, flexibility in the timing of parliamentary elections can avoid periods of legislative gridlock that can occur in a fixed period presidential system. Such feature in being able to time elections whenever it is advantageous to the ruling party is not a real issue, however, as voters ultimately have the ability to still make the choice of whether to vote for the ruling party or not.

It has been well-observed that the rankings of top-performing countries according to performance indices such as [[list of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita]], [[Human Development Index]], [[Global Competitiveness Report]], [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], and many more performance indexes feature most best-performing countries having parliamentary systems, while most worst-performing countries have presidential systems or strong-president semi-presidential systems. This also extends to the fact that majority - if not all - of the countries that dominate top ranks of lists like the [[Global Liveability Ranking]], the [[Mercer Quality of Living Survey]], the [[Henley Passport Index|Henley Passsport Index]], and many such ranking lists use parliamentary systems. In contrast, the [[list of cities by murder rate]] shows an overwhelming number of cities found in countries that use presidential systems.

The '''peace offering''' (Hebrew ''zevah shelamim'') was one of the [[korban|sacrifices and offerings]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (Leviticus 3; 7.11–34).&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion - Page 556 Adele Berlin, Maxine Grossman - 2011 "PEACE OFFERING (Heb. zevah. shelamim), one of the *sacrifices (Lv. 3; 7.11–34). Its distinctive features were that only the blood and the representative fatty portions of the animal were placed on the altar and the prescribed portions of the ..."&lt;/ref&gt; The term "peace offering" is generally constructed from "slaughter offering" ''zevah'' and the plural of ''shelem'' (Hebrew {{Hebrew|זֶבַח הַשְּׁלָמִים}} ''zevah hashelamiym''), but is sometimes found without zevah as ''shelamim'' plural alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H8002&amp;t=KJV Strong's Concordance entry for ''shelem'' 87 uses]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''korban shelamim'' (קורבן שלמים) is also used in rabbinical writings. In English Bible versions the term is rendered "peace offering" (KJV 1611, JPS 1917), "offering of well-being" (NRSV).

Parallels of offerings with the same semitic root S-L-M also occur in Ugaritic texts.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. de Moor, “The Peace-Offering in Ugarit and Israel,” Schrift en Uitleg. FS W. H. Gispen (Kampen, 1970), 112-17;&lt;/ref&gt; After the Hebrew Bible the term also occurs in the Dead Sea scrolls, for example in the [[Temple Scroll]].&lt;ref&gt;L. H. Schiffman, “Shelamim Sacrifices in the Temple Scroll,” FS Y. Yadin. ErIsr 20 (1989) 176*-83*; &lt;/ref&gt; In the Septuagint the term is rendered by two different Greek nouns. First in the Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges variations of ''soterios'' ("of saving"); in Samuel and Kings variations of ''eirenikos'' ("of peace").&lt;ref&gt;''Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament'', Volume XV  G. Johannes Botterweck, Helmer Ringgren, Heinz-Josef Fabry - 2006- Page 106 "SHELAMIM", p115 "in the Septuagint"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4051">'''Peasant leagues''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese:]] '''ligas camponesas''') were social organizations composed of [[sharecropper]]s, [[subsistence farmer]]s, and other small agriculturalists. They originated in the [[agreste]] region of [[Northeastern Brazil]] in the 1950s. They were organized by the [[Brazilian Communist Party]] (PCB),&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Cliff. ''Keeping Communism Down on the Farm: The Brazilian Rural Labor Movement during the Cold War'', [[Latin American Perspectives]] Vol.33, pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and were later picked up by [[Francisco Julião]], a member of the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labor Party]] (PDT) and other socialists. Founded to improve the standard of living for rural workers, their later objective became to oppose the power of [[latifundia]] in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Cliff. ''Keeping Communism Down on the Farm: The Brazilian Rural Labor Movement during the Cold War'', [[Latin American Perspectives]] Vol.33, pg. 28-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The leagues were founded by Brazilian communists, who believed that the latifundia, which had always dominated the Brazilian economy, were in a [[semicolonial]] relationship with the [[United States]] and were conspiring to oppress the working class by forcing rural workers to produce [[cash crops]] instead of food for native consumption and refusing to develop land which could not support those crops,&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Cliff. ''Keeping Communism Down on the Farm: The Brazilian Rural Labor Movement during the Cold War'', [[Latin American Perspectives]] Vol.33, pg. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; a belief partly shared by outsiders to communism.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, T. Lynn. ''Land Reform in Brazil'', [[Luso-Brazilian Review]] Vol. 1 No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the communists was to raise the rural workers' standard of living sufficiently that a classic Marxist capitalist-to-socialist transition could occur.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Cliff. ''Keeping Communism Down on the Farm: The Brazilian Rural Labor Movement during the Cold War'', [[Latin American Perspectives]] Vol.33, pg. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the PCB began struggling with political pressure in the late 1950s Francisco Julião began taking on the business of establishing and organizing leagues. In January 1955, Francisco Julião made one of the most important associations legal, the SAPPP{{huh|date=December 2016}}, that used to fight for peasants rights before its legalization.

Communists objected to his growing role in the movement. His attempts to unify the leagues and resistance to registering them as unions conflicted with their own goal of attaining legitimacy, and his use of violent revolutionary rhetoric made them worry about retaliation from the military and police.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Shepard. ''Disunity and Discontent: A Study of Peasant Political Movements in Brazil'', [[Journal of Latin American Studies]] Vol.3, pp.14-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The populist Brazilian government's attitude towards the leagues varied over time from neutral to positive, while that of the military and police was uniformly negative. The armed forces in the Brazilian Northeast had many connections to wealthy landowners whose enterprises were threatened by the activities of the leagues, and they would go to extraordinary lengths to curtail league activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0000762516/DOC_0000762516.pdf Current Intelligence Weekly Summary 1 June 1962] pg.7&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] established organizations in the Northeast which functioned similarly but were conservative and [[anticommunism|anti-communist]] in their outlook; these groups were crushed alongside the peasant leagues following the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|1964 coup]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Iêda S. and Wiarda, Howard J.

'''Right to farm laws''' in the United States deny [[nuisance]] lawsuits against farmers who use accepted and standard farming practices and have been in prior operation even if these practices harm or bother adjacent property owners or the general public. Agricultural nuisances may include noise, odors, visual clutter and dangerous structures. All 50 states have some form of Right to Farm law.

Many of these laws were passed after 1980 because of the reduction of available farmland, adversity from private and public nuisance actions, which hinder the prospect of farming. The laws are aimed to minimize the threat to normal farming practices from nuisance litigation and prohibitive state and local government regulation. In contrast to typical farmland preservation policies, which aim to preserve farmland itself, Right to Farm laws attempt to preserve the agricultural practices and enhance farm viability.&lt;ref name="Political Economy of Right-to-farm."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adesoji|last2=Friedman|first1=Adelaja|first2=Keith|authorlink1=Adesoji Adelaja|title=Political Economy of Right-to-farm |journal=EconBiz. Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics |date=1 December 1999 |page=568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local laws represent support for farming practices by a community and are often so more refined and clearer than state laws; they typically define the extent of protection farmers actually receive from nuisance suits and inappropriate regulation.

==Protection for farmers ==
[[File:Rochester is a Right to farm community.jpg|thumb|[[Rochester, Massachusetts]] adopted a Right to Farm law in 2012&lt;ref name=Rochester&gt;{{cite web|title=Town of Rochester Massachusetts Zoning By-Laws |url=http://www.townofrochestermass.com/bylaws.htm |publisher=Town of Rochester, MA |accessdate=19 March 2015 |quote=This By-Law encourages the pursuit of agriculture, promotes agriculture-based economic opportunities, and protects farmlands within the Town of Rochester by allowing agricultural uses and related activities to function with minimal conflict with abutters and Town agencies, when done in compliance with applicable state laws, Town By-Laws and regulations. This By-Law shall apply to all jurisdictional areas within the Town.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Right to farm laws vary across the nation. They are intended to bolster the legitimacy of agricultural concerns, defend farmers rights without undue outside interference, and minimize or resolve public and private land use conflicts. In a broader sense the notion originally referred to relief from all kinds of undue interference, usually involving legal interpretations focused on nuisance issues such as noise, odors, environmental, visual, farm technology, etc. This is partly because it is a modification of the common law doctrine of nuisance.&lt;ref name="Farmer-Nonfarmer Conflicts in the Urban Fringe: Will Right-to-Farm Hel."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lisansky and Clark |first1=Judith and George |title=Farmer-Nonfarmer Conflicts in the Urban Fringe: Will Right-to-Farm Hel.|journal=Farmland|date=1 January 1987 |pages=220 |url=http://www.farmlandinfo.org/sites/default/files/FARMER-NONFARMER_CONFLICTS_IN_THE_URBAN_FRINGE_1.pdf |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common law nuisances are seen as private or public nuisances. A public nuisance impairs the health, safety, morals, and comfort of the general community without necessarily harming particular property rights in any kind way. A private nuisance unreasonably interferes with the use and enjoyment of another's land.&lt;ref name="Lapping"/&gt;

For a nuisance that the law will provide a remedy, there must he a substantial and unreasonable interference with the property interest being asserted. The interference can be negligent or intentional. For instance in the duties of farm operations, an action constituting a nuisance will be deemed intentional even if it is unintended if it is an easily likely consequence of the farmer's otherwise protected farming activities. The drifting of sprayed farm pesticides onto a neighbor's land is considered an intentional nuisance even though this particular result is unintended.&lt;ref name="Lapping"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lapping and Leutwiler |first1=Mark B.and Nels R. |title=Agriculture in Conflict: Right-to-Farm Laws and the Peri-Urban Milieu for Farming |journal=Farmland |date=1 January 1987 |page=211 |url=http://www.farmlandinfo.org/sites/default/files/AGRICULTURE_IN_CONFLICT_1.pdf |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Right-to-farm policies vary at different policy levels, resulting in inconsistent interpretations regarding what constitutes an 'agrarian district' or 'proper' agrarian practice. Government officials may intervene and eact such laws for resource preservation or municipal management purposes, but states and their respective localities are usually left to their own devices. In New York, the NYSDAM (New York State Department of Agriculture &amp; Markets) evaluates nuisance lawsuits on a case-by-case basis. As per §308 of New York's Right-To-Farm Statute, farm owners and operators are protected from private nuisance suits "provided such agricultural practice constitutes a sound agricultural practice pursuant to an opinion issued upon request by the commissioner".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/righttofarm/newyork.pdf |title=States’ Right-To-Farm Statutes: State of New York |last=Weldon |first=Kyle |last2=Rumley |first2=Elizabeth |date=2016 |publisher=National Agricultural Law Center |location=Fayetteville, AR |access-date=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, New York's policy does not protect against damages for personal injury or wrongful death claims, nor does it apply to public nuisances. Note that this policy definition may influence stakeholders to obtain farmland in states where their interests are protected by that state's respective right-to-farm law.

== History ==
The laws were developed in the 1970s as a response to [[suburb]]an encroachment on [[Farm|agricultural land]]. The concern was that as farmland was converted to suburban developments, the new residents would bring lawsuits against the pre-existing farms complaining about agricultural noise, dust, and other nuisances.&lt;ref name=FarmFoundation&gt;{{cite web |title=Right-to-Farm Laws: History &amp; Future |url=https://www.farmfoundation.org/news/articlefiles/129-hipp.pdf |publisher=Farm Foundation |location=Oak Brook, IL |accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal costs to defend themselves would tend to push farmers out of business, and the trend toward urbanization would accelerate. The laws were created as a way to protect small farmers from these lawsuits and thereby preserve the open space that made the communities attractive in the first place. [[Massachusetts]] passed the first right to farm law in 1979.&lt;ref name=ALECExposed&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richardson|first1=Jill|title=ALEC Exposed: Protecting Factory Farms and Sewage Sludge?|url=http://www.prwatch.org/news/2011/08/10922/alec-exposed-protecting-factory-farms-and-sewage-sludge|website=PRWatch|publisher=The Center for Media and Democracy|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[Pilesgrove Township, New Jersey]] enacted the state's first right-to-farm law, protecting farming as a "natural right hereby ordained to exist as a permitted use everywhere in the Township of Pilesgrove."&lt;ref&gt;DePalma, Anthony. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E05E0DF1039E432A25755C1A9679D94619FD6CF&amp;legacy=true "Right-to-Farm Gains Backing"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 16, 1980. Accessed October 31, 2016. "Last April, the Pilesgrove Township Council passed New Jersey's first right-to-farm ordinance. It recognizes the farmers' right to go about their daily business as a 'natural right hereby ordained to exist as a permitted use everywhere in the Township of Pilesgrove.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2015, every state has a similar law, but the details can vary.&lt;ref name=sourcewatch&gt;{{cite web |title=Right to Farm Laws |url=http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Right_to_Farm_Laws |website=Sourcewatch |publisher=The Center for Media and Democracy |accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
The utilization of right to farm policies for corporate agriculture can be considered a 'wicked problem'. These problems are shaped by "dynamic social and political factors as well as biophysical complexities", and an array of local, state, and government stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Batie|first=Sandra S.|date=2008|title=Wicked Problems and Applied Economics|url=|journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics |volume=90|pages=1176–1191}}&lt;/ref&gt; These diverse actors result in a high degree of variability in terms of defining what is protected under respective right to farm laws.  Thus, although the initial intention of such policies was to preserve the nation's agrarian roots and support the small-scale farmer, potential for misappropriation exists. Public sentiment expresses concern that the literature in these policies may prevent localities and states from regulating any number of agriculture based issues, essentially grant corporations immunity from environmental and ecological consequences resulting from their practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://thinkprogress.org/how-corporate-agribusiness-is-quietly-seizing-the-heartland-with-right-to-farm-laws-de482b811217 |title=How Corporate Agribusiness Is Quietly Seizing The Heartland with ‘Right To Farm’ Laws |date=2015-03-26 |work=ThinkProgress |access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)—a Koch-brothers organization which writes legislation on behalf of major multi-billion dollar corporations such as ExxonMobil, Pfizer, AT&amp;T, SAP SE, and State Farm Insurance, among others—financially backed Missouri's Right-to-Farm amendment (Amendment 1), fueling further controversy that Right-to-Farm laws are being enacted to assist corporate agriculture, not small family-owned farms and the traditional farming practices used by small farm owners.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Connell |first1=Kit |publisher=MintPress News|date=20 August 2014|title=Missourians Fight ALEC Over Big Agriculture’s "Right to Farm" |url=http://www.mintpressnews.com/missourians-fight-alec-big-agricultures-right-farm/195612/|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Politicus"&gt;{{cite news|date=6 February 2014|publisher=Politicus USA|title=The Farm Bill Makes The Koch Brothers Richer While Destroying the Clean Water Act|url=http://www.politicususa.com/2014/02/06/farm-bill-koch-brothers-richer-destroying-clean-water-act.html|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Oklahoma voters defeated a Right-to-Farm bill (State Question 777) which garnered just 39.7 percent of the vote.&lt;ref name="Right to Farm bill fails"&gt;{{cite news |title=Right to Farm bill fails |url=http://www.koco.com/article/right-to-farm-bill-fails/8260338 |publisher=KOCO-TV |accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="State Question 777 divided Oklahoma along geographic lines"&gt;{{cite news|title=State Question 777 divided Oklahoma along geographic lines |url=http://newsok.com/article/5526360 |publisher=The Oklahoman (NewsOK.com) |accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; State Question 777 was heavily backed by the Oklahoma Farm Bureau and by voters in the Oklahoma panhandle where the giant multinational agribusiness Seaboard Corporation has a pork production plant.&lt;ref name="Right to Farm Debate: Sorting out a divisive state question'"&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Right to Farm’ Debate: Sorting out a divisive state question|url=http://kfor.com/2016/11/03/right-to-farm-debate-sorting-out-a-divisive-state-question/|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rootless cosmopolitan''' ({{lang-ru|безродный космополит}}, ''bezrodnyi kosmopolit'') was a pejorative [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[euphemism]] widely used during [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Soviet anti-Semitic campaign]] of 1948&amp;ndash;1953, which culminated in the "exposure" of the non-existent [[Doctors' plot]].&lt;ref name="jcsw"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Journal of Cold War Studies | publisher = MIT Press | year = 2002 | authors = Azadovskii K, Egorov B | title = From Anti-Westernism to Anti-Semitism | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 66&amp;ndash;80 | url = http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/152039702753344834}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "rootless cosmopolitan" referred mostly to [[Jews|Jewish]] intellectuals, as an accusation in their lack of [[patriotism]], i.e., lack of full allegiance to the Soviet Union.

==The antisemitic campaign==
{{further|History of the Jews in Russia and Soviet Union|History of anti-Semitism}}

===Beginning===
After [[World War II]], the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] (JAC) grew increasingly influential to the post-[[Holocaust]] Soviet Jewry, and was accepted as its representative in the [[Western world|West]]. As its activities sometimes contradicted official Soviet policies (see ''[[The Black Book of Soviet Jewry]]'' as an example), it became a nuisance to Soviet authorities. The [[Central Auditing Commission]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] concluded that instead of focusing its attention on the "struggle against forces of international reaction", the JAC continued the line of the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]]—a dangerous designation, since former Bund members were to be "purged".

During a meeting with Soviet [[intelligentsia]] in 1946, [[Stalin]] voiced his concerns about recent developments in Soviet culture, which later would materialize in the "battle against [[cosmopolitanism]]" (see [[Zhdanov Doctrine]]).
&lt;blockquote&gt;Recently, a dangerous tendency seems to be seen in some of the literary works emanating under the pernicious influence of the West and brought about by the subversive activities of the foreign intelligence. Frequently in the pages of Soviet literary journals works are found where Soviet people, builders of communism are shown in pathetic and ludicrous forms. The positive Soviet hero is derided and inferior before all things foreign and cosmopolitanism that we all fought against from the time of Lenin, characteristic of the political leftovers, is many times applauded. In the theater it seems that Soviet plays are pushed aside by plays from foreign bourgeois authors. The same thing is starting to happen in Soviet films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.northstarcompass.org/nsc0306/stalin.htm |title=Stalin On Art and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1946 and 1947, the new campaign against cosmopolitanism affected Soviet scientists, such as the physicist [[Pyotr Kapitsa]] and the president of the Belorussian Academy of Sciences Anton Zhebrak. They along with other scientists were denounced for contacts with their Western colleagues and support for "bourgeois science".&lt;ref name=Bibikov&gt;{{cite report |last=Bibikov |first=V. |title=Science &amp; Technology – USSR: Science &amp; Technology Policy |chapter=Lysenko Foe Anton Zhebrak Rehabilitated |publisher=Foreign Broadcast Information Service |date=November 1988 |url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA350349 |pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, many literary critics were accused of "kneeling before the West", as well as anti-patriotism and cosmopolitanism. For example, the campaign targeted those who studied the works of [[Alexander Veselovsky]], the founder of Russian comparative literature, which was described as a "bourgeois cosmopolitan direction in literary criticism".&lt;ref name=Dobrenko&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dobrenko |first1=Evgeny |last2=Tihanov |first2=Galin |title=A History of Russian Literary Theory and Criticism: The Soviet Age and Beyond |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |location=Pittsburgh |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-8229-4411-9 |pages=171–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1948===
In January 1948, the JAC's head, the popular actor and world-famous public figure [[Solomon Mikhoels]], was killed by the [[Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs|Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs]] on the [[Politburo]]'s orders; his murder was framed as a car accident where a truck ran over him as he was taking a walk on a narrow road.{{efn|According to the historian [[Gennady Kostyrchenko]], recently opened Soviet archives contain [http://www.mk.ru/blogs/idmk/2005/09/06/mk-daily/60646/ evidence that the assassination was organized by L.&amp;nbsp;M. Tsanava and S. Ogoltsov] of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.}} This was followed by eventual arrests of JAC's members and its termination.

The USSR voted for the 1947 [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] and in May 1948, it recognized the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|establishment of the state of Israel]] there, subsequently supporting it with weapons (via [[Czechoslovakia]], in defiance of the embargo) in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli war]]. Many Soviet Jews felt inspired and sympathetic towards Israel and sent thousands of letters to the (still formally existing) JAC with offers to contribute to or even volunteer for Israel's defence.

In September 1948, the first Israeli ambassador to the USSR, [[Golda Meir]],{{efn|At the time, her last name was Myerson. She changed it to Meir in 1956.}} arrived in Moscow. Huge enthusiastic crowds (estimated 50,000) gathered along her path and in and around [[Moscow Choral Synagogue|Moscow synagogue]] when she attended it for [[Yom Kippur]] and [[Rosh Hashanah]]. These events corresponded in time with a visible upsurge of Russian nationalism orchestrated by official propaganda, the increasingly hostile [[Cold War]] and the realization by the Soviet leadership that [[Israel]] had chosen the Western option. Domestically, Soviet Jews were being considered a security liability for their [[Jewish diaspora|international connections]], especially to the United States, and growing national awareness.

With United States becoming the opponent of the Soviet Union by the end of 1948, the USSR switched sides in the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and began supporting the Arabs against Israel, first politically and later also militarily. For his part [[David Ben-Gurion]] declared support for the United States in the [[Korean War]], despite opposition from left-wing Israeli parties. From 1950 on, Israeli–Soviet relations were an inextricable part of the Cold War—with ominous implications for Soviet Jews supporting Israel, or perceived as supporting it.

==="About one anti-patriotic group of theatre critics"===
[[File:Rootless cosmopolitan.jpg|thumb|Antisemitic caricature of Rootless cosmopolitan. 1949 "Krokodil" magazine cover.]]
A new stage of the campaign opened on January 28, 1949, when an article entitled "About one anti-patriotic group of theatre critics" appeared in the newspaper ''Pravda'', an official organ of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An anti-patriotic group has developed in theatrical criticism. It consists of followers of bourgeois aestheticism. They penetrate our press and operate most freely in the pages of the magazine, ''Teatr'', and the newspaper, ''Sovetskoe iskusstvo''. These critics have lost their sense of responsibility to the people. They represent a rootless cosmopolitanism which is deeply repulsive and inimical to Soviet man. They obstruct the development of Soviet literature; the feeling of national Soviet pride is alien to them.&lt;ref name=Pinkus&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinkus |first=Benjamin |title=The Soviet Government and the Jews 1948-1967: A Documented Study |year=1984 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-24713-6 |pages=183–184 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7g8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the journalist [[Masha Gessen]], a concise definition of rootless cosmopolitan appeared in an issue of ''Voprosy istorii'' (''The Issues of History'') in 1949: "The rootless cosmopolitan ... falsifies and misrepresents the worldwide historical role of the Russian people in the construction of socialist society and the victory over the enemies of humanity, over German fascism in the [[Great Patriotic War]]." Gessen states that the term used for "Russian" is an exclusive term that means ethnic Russians only, and so she concludes that "any historian who neglected to sing the praises of the heroic ethnic Russians&amp;nbsp;... was a likely traitor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gessen | first=Masha |authorlink=Masha Gessen |title=Two Babushkas |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2005 |page=205 |isbn=0-7475-7080-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign included a crusade in the state-controlled mass media to expose literary pseudonyms of Jewish writers by putting their real names in parentheses in order to reveal to the public that they were ethnic Jews.&lt;ref name="Ro’i"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Anticosmopolitan_Campaign | title=Anticosmopolitan Campaign | publisher=YIVO Institute for Jewish Research | date=2010 | accessdate=February 24, 2013 | author=Yaacov Ro’i}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ree&gt;{{cite book |last=Ree |first=Erik van |title=The Political Thought of Joseph Stalin: A Study in Twentieth Century Revolutionary Patriotism |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2004 |isbn=0-7007-1749-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GY6bWw_tLf0C&amp;pg=PA205#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thirteen Soviet Jewish poets and writers, five of them members of [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]], [[Night of the Murdered Poets|were executed in the Lubyanka Prison]] in Moscow on August 12, 1952.

==Legacy==
As a result of the campaign, scores of Soviet Jews were fired from their jobs. In 1947, Jews constituted 18 per cent of Soviet scientific workers, but by 1970 this number declined to 7 per cent, which can still be compared to about 3 to 4 per cent of the Soviet population at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], ''The History of the Jews''. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Anything Jewish became suppressed by the Soviet authorities, and even the word ''Jew'' disappeared from the media.  Many were shocked to find a Yiddish verse (sung by Mikhoels) cut out from the famous lullaby in the Soviet classic movie ''[[Circus (1936 film)|Circus]]'' ("Tsirk", 1936), known by heart by millions and still very popular in post-war Soviet cinemas.

A historian of Zionism, [[Walter Laqueur]], noted: "When, in the 1950s under Stalin, the Jews of the Soviet Union came under severe attack and scores were executed, it was under the banner of [[anti-Zionism]] rather than [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]], which had been given a bad name by Adolf Hitler."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Laqueur ''Dying for Jerusalem: the past, present and future of the Holiest City''. Naperville: Sourcebooks, Inc., 2006 {{ISBN|1-4022-0632-1}}; p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

{{primary|date=July 2017}}
'''Safeguarding''' is a term used in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safeguarding.ie/ |title=The National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=4 December 2014 |website= |publisher=The National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to denote measures to protect the [[health]], [[well-being]] and [[human rights]] of individuals, which allow people — especially children, [[youth|young people]] and [[vulnerable adult]]s — to live free from abuse, harm and neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/content/safeguarding-people |title=Safeguarding people |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=18 June 2014 |website=Care Quality Commission |publisher= |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any [[child]] can be hurt, put at risk of harm or abused, regardless of age, [[ethnicity]], [[gender]] or [[religion]]. The [[United Kingdom government|UK government]] has enacted legislation and published guidance to protect children from maltreatment, prevent the impairment of children's health or development, ensure children grow up in circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care, and enable children and young people to have the best outcomes. Responsibility for these aims is deemed to lie with everyone who comes into contact with children and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safenetwork.org.uk/GETTING_STARTED/Pages/Why_does_safeguarding_matter.aspx |title=What is safeguarding and why does it matter to my organisation? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Safe Network |publisher=[[NSPCC]] and Children England |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adults in need of safeguarding help are generally [[Old age|elderly]] and frail, and either live alone or in [[care home]]s with little support from family members. They may have [[mental health]] issues, a [[physical disability]] or [[Learning disability|learning difficulties]]. Professional [[caregiver|carers]] ideally focus on empowerment, protection, prevention, proportionate responses, partnership and accountability to safeguard vulnerable adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scie.org.uk/adults/safeguarding/ |title=Adult Safeguarding |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Social Care Institute for Excellence |publisher= |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Birmingham]] and the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], the term 'adults at risk' is preferred over 'vulnerable adults'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bsab.org/what-is-abuse/who-is-at-risk/ |title=Definition of an adult at risk |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=Birmingham Safeguarding Adults Board |publisher= |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child==
Safeguarding children is a concept that reaches beyond child protection to incorporate the additional aims of preventing the harm of children’s health and development, ensuring children are growing up in circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/youngpeople/a0064461/what-is-the-difference-between-safeguarding-and-child-protection The difference between safeguarding and child protection - The Department for Education]. Education.gov.uk. Retrieved on 2011-06-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK Government has defined the term ‘safeguarding children’ as:
''‘The process of protecting children from abuse or neglect, preventing impairment of their health and development, and ensuring they are growing up in circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care that enables children to have optimum life chances and enter adulthood successfully.’''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safeguardingchildren.org.uk Safeguarding Children / Ofsted - Ofsted]. Safeguardingchildren.org.uk. Retrieved on 2011-06-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

This shift from traditional child protection to a more all-encompassing approach was influenced by the first Joint Chief Inspectors’ safeguarding children report (2002) and the [[Victoria Climbié#Inquiry|Victoria Climbié Inquiry]] (2003).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safeguardingchildren.org.uk/Safeguarding-Children/2005-report 2005 report / Safeguarding Children / Ofsted - Ofsted]. Safeguardingchildren.org.uk. Retrieved on 2011-06-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Every Child Matters]] programme outlined in the [[Children Act 2004]] formalised these changes in approach into a legislative framework. [[Every Child Matters]] aimed to improve outcomes for children in 5 key areas; being healthy, staying safe, enjoying and achieving, making a positive contribution and achieving economic well-being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safeguardingchildren.org.uk/Safeguarding-Children/2008-report 2008 report / Safeguarding Children / Ofsted - Ofsted]. Safeguardingchildren.org.uk (2008-07-08). Retrieved on 2011-06-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

To help achieve this the Act made a number of institutional changes including the abolition of Area Child Protection Committees that had been deemed to have performed poorly in some areas by the Joint Chief Inspectors’ 2002 report and the formation of the multi-agency Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs). These consisted of representatives from local partner agencies such as housing, health, police and probation services. The LSCBs were charged with co-ordinating the functions of all partner agencies in relation to safeguarding children. They carry out this function by, among other things, agreeing the contribution of all member agencies and deciding how these pooled funds should be allocated. In addition they are responsible for commissioning independent Serious Case Reviews and training member agency staff in safeguarding children best practice.  The Act also placed a duty on all agencies to make arrangements to safeguard and promote the welfare of children &lt;ref&gt;Safeguarding children The third Chief inspectors’ report on arrangements to safeguard children 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the government released Working Together to Safeguard Children, which set out the ways in which organizations and individuals should work together to safeguard and promote the wellbeing of children.  In 2010 this was superseded by Working Together to Safeguard Children (2010) which expanded the focus on interagency working and took into account the recommendations of [[Lord Laming]]s 2008 progress report The Protection of Children in England which suggested it was imperative that frontline professionals get to know children as individuals.

In 2014 a High Court judge said that it appeared to be a practice "widespread across the country" that children were taken into foster care based on [[social services]] reports which family courts "cut and pasted" into their own rulings, without giving the parents the opportunity to view the reports or respond to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Cut-and-paste rulings 'let children be taken away from mothers'|last=Cheston|first=Paul|date=2014-02-18|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|page=25|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adult==
The [[Care Act 2014]] introduced new legislation regarding safeguarding [[Vulnerable adult|vulnerable adults]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/contents/enacted/data.htm|title=Care Act 2014|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act sets out a legal framework for how local authorities and other organisations should react to suspicion of abuse or neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scie.org.uk/care-act-2014/safeguarding-adults/|title=The Care Act: Safeguarding adults|website=www.scie.org.uk|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
A key part of safeguarding work is assessment.

Professionals conducting assessments of families where neglect is taking place are said sometimes to make the error of not asking the right questions, such as:&lt;ref&gt;Williams, M. (2015) Evidence based decisions in child neglect: An evaluation of an exploratory approach to assessment using the North Carolina Family Assessment Scale, London, NSPCC. https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/research-reports/evidence-based-decisions-evaluation-report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4416">'''Simpel-Fonetik''' is a system of English-language spelling reform that simplifies the reading, writing, and pronunciation of words in English. It was created by Allan Kiisk, a multi-lingual (English, German, Latin, and Estonian) professor of engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neeme|first1=Urmas|title=Väliseestlane reformib eesti keele eeskujul inglise keelt|url=http://www.postimees.ee/886990/valiseestlane-reformib-eesti-keele-eeskujul-inglise-keelt|publisher=Postimees|date=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on phonetic languages including [[Estonian language|Estonian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leivat|first1=Laas|title=Estonian as an example for spelling in English|url=http://www.eesti.ca/estonian-as-an-example-for-spelling-in-english/article36847|publisher=Eesti Elu|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], it removes common difficulties of learning to communicate in English by correlating one unique letter per sound and one sound per letter.

According to [[Noah Webster]], "In a perfect language, every simple sound would be expressed by a distinct character; and no character would have more than one sound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webster|first1=Noah|title=The American Spelling Book|date=1824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

===Basic principles===
Simpel-Fonetik writing is based on the following principles:

1. Each letter represents only one spoken sound

2. There is a letter for each basic sound in the English language

3. Double letters (two adjacent identical letters) represent long vowels and strong consonants.

===Letters in the Simpel-Fonetik alphabet===
There are 24 letters: 17 consonants and 7 vowels.

Most of the letters are from the current English Alphabet: A B D E F G H I J K L M N O P R S T U V W Z. Two letters are new: Ä Ö.

There are 4 letters in the English Alphabet that are no longer needed: C Q X Y.

===Pronunciation===
Below are examples of words that show the sound for each letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiisk|first1=Allan|title=Simpel-Fonetik Dictionary|date=2012|publisher=Tate Publishing, Mustang, Oklahoma.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8788">[[File:SHARP logo.svg|thumb|right|Logo commonly used by those associated with SHARP]]

'''Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice''' ('''SHARP''') are [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] [[skinhead]]s who oppose [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascists]] and other political racists, particularly if those racists identify themselves as skinheads. SHARPs draw inspiration from the [[Multiracial|biracial]] origins of the skinhead [[subculture]], and resent what they see as the hijacking of the "skinhead" name by [[white power skinhead]]s (sometimes deriding them as "boneheads"). Beyond the opposition to racism, there is no official SHARP political ideology.

The SHARP logo is based on the logo of [[Trojan Records]], which originally mainly released black [[Jamaica]]n [[ska]], [[rocksteady]], and [[reggae]] artists. Some variants of this design also incorporate the checkerboard motif of [[2 Tone Records]], known for its multiracial roster of ska- and reggae-influenced bands.

The way in which SHARPs dress is to project an image that looks hard and smart, in an evolving continuity with style ideals established in the middle-to-late 1960s.
This style and demeanour originated from the [[United Kingdom|UK]], growing out of the pre-existent [[Mod (subculture)|Mod]] movement, taking cues and influences from Jamaican ska and [[Rude boy|Rude Boy]] culture. They remain true to the style's original purpose of enjoying life, clothes, attitude and music. This does not include blanket hatred of other people based on their [[Ethnic group|skin colour]].

==History==

The original [[skinhead]] subculture started in the [[United Kingdom]] in late 1960s, and had heavy British [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] and [[Jamaica]]n [[rude boy]] influences, including a love for [[ska]] and [[soul music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_1_38/ai_n6234788/pg_1 | work=Journal of Social History | title=Subcultures, pop music and politics: skinheads and "Nazi rock" in England and Germany | first=Timothy S. | last=Brown | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Old Skool Jim |first= |title=Trojan Skinhead Reggae Box Set liner notes |publisher=Trojan Records |date= |location=London |id=TJETD169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=George |title=Spirit of '69 - A Skinhead Bible |publisher=S.T.

Because of this, the mainstream media began to label the whole skinhead identity as [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]]. This new [[white power skinhead]] movement then spread to other countries, including the [[United States]].

Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice was started in 1987 in New York as a response by suburban adolescents to the bigotry of the growing White Power Movement  in 1982.  Traditional skinheads (Trads) formed as a way to show that the skinhead subculture was not based on racism and political extremism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212546/http://www.skinheadnation.co.uk/newyorkskinheads.htm Skinhead Nation, chapter: The Big Apple Bites Back] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; André Schlesinger (and his [[Oi!]] band [[The Press (band)|The Press]]) and Jason O'Toole (vocalist of the [[hardcore punk]] group [[Life's Blood]]) were among SHARP's early supporters. In 1989, Roddy Moreno of the Welsh Oi! band [[The Oppressed]] visited New York City and met a few SHARP members. On his return to the [[United Kingdom]], he designed a new SHARP logo based on the Trojan Reggae labels design and started promoting SHARP ideals to British skinheads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/The-Oppressed-sharp-attitude/108930239188615 The Oppressed; Official Website&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/oppressed/ BBC - Wales - The Oppressed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
SHARP then spread throughout Europe and in other continents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skinheadnation.co.uk/sharpskinheads.htm SHARP skinheads&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709164353/http://www.skinheadnation.co.uk/sharpskinheads.htm |date=2007-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK and other European countries, the SHARP attitude was more based on the individual than on organized groups. In the 2000s, SHARP is thought to have become more of an individual designation than an official organization.

[[File:Anti-SHARP hate symbol.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Racist skinheads and other white supremacists have used this symbol, along with many other hate symbols, in opposition to SHARP.&lt;ref name="adl-symbols"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hate on Display: Anti-SHARP Imagery|url=http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/anti-sharp-imagery.html|website=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
]]

Many people may confuse SHARP members with racists, since their appearance is superficially similar: shaved heads, denim, lace up boots, [[Dress shirt|button-down shirts]] and suspenders (called ''braces''). One glib differentiation that might be imagined to separate the two would be music interests. SHARPs may listen to culturally influenced music such as: Soul, Reggae, and Ska; but also [[Punk rock|punk]], [[Hardcore punk|Hardcore]] and [[Oi!]]. Racist skinheads would disagree with some or all of these musical choices; but may listen to Punk, Hardcore, Oi!, as well as [[Nazi Punk]] and [[National Socialist Black Metal]].

In a deliberate attempt to reject the growing racist subculture, since the early eighties SHARPs promulgated an anti-racist identity through small amateur [[fanzine]] publications like ''Hard As Nails''. During the pre-Internet era, these publication established a network of likeminded individuals with similar musical and stylistic attitudes, who considered anti-racism an indispensable part of a living skinhead scene.
Another strand of the same Trad revival sought to affirm explicit links with the foundation of Mod subculture and its apolitical, black-positive standards of fashion. The [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]] scene, with its runs and [[Northern Soul]] dances, had never gone entirely away; and in the post-Punk rediscovery of the past, under the influence of [[The Jam (band)|The Jam]] and [[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]], it seemed a fresh and self-renewing direction for skinhead itself to go in.

By 1989, this Trad scene was ripe for the injection of a cultural influence like SHARP, much as its own appearance had been symptomatic of an American internal revolution in US skinheads' attitudes to race and their own subculture.

An outgrowth of SHARP, Red and Anarchist Skinheads (RASH), formed in 1993 against anti-gay sentiment in the nonracist skinhead community.&lt;ref name="BronnerClark2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bronner|first1=Simon J.|last2=Clark|first2=Cindy Dell|title=Youth Cultures in America &amp;#91;2 volumes&amp;#93;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SoCeCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA622|year=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-4408-3392-2|page=622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Association to Stop Racism Against Blacks'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-08-15/news/1991227175_1_aritas-racism-against-blacks-community-relations-commission Battling racism is a family affair Aritas, of Japan, fight negative depictions of blacks in homeland.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dreamland Japan: Writings on Modern Manga|author=Frederik L. Schodt|pages=63–68|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ja|'''黒人差別をなくす会'''}}) is a private organization founded in Japan in 1988. Based at [[Sakai]], [[Osaka]], the association is known for causing publishers around Japan to suspend from printing Japanese localized versions of the picture book "[[The Story of Little Black Sambo]]".

== Summary ==
The organization was initially formed by a couple, Toshiji Arita and Kimiko Arita living in Sakai, Osaka together with their 9-year-old son, Hajima Arita, on August 11, 1988. Kimiko Arita was the association's chairman and Kimiko Arita was the club's vice chairman. Hajime Arita was their treasurer. Initially they were the only members of the association, its membership increased to 135 as of 1992 February&lt;ref&gt;Asahi Shimbun 1992-02-22 Morning edition 「気付かぬまま黒人差別　現状認識へセミナー　京都・田辺町」&lt;/ref&gt; and 225 as of 1995 December.&lt;ref name="aera"&gt;Weekly Aera 1995-12-18 「黒人差別　コミックス「あんみつ姫」も回収処分（ｉｎ・ｓｈｏｒｔ）」&lt;/ref&gt; There is no report of recent activity from the organization.

== Origin ==
In July 1988, [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] published a report titled "Old Black Stereotypes Find New Lives in Japan",{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} which describes the design of a [[Sambo and Banana]] doll by [[Sanrio]], as well as [[mannequin]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s manufactured by Yamato Mannequin which were found in department stores, as discriminatory. Sanrio immediately ceased the doll's production and recalled all the dolls. However, after reading the report, the Arita family agreed with the position of the article that such an expression can be considered as discriminatory, and as a result they went to collect goods that depict black people from shops and start investigating how they are being depicted.

== Activity ==
Activity of the association mainly include sending opposition letters against characters, comic, animation, publishers and corporate, for expressions that are being considered by the association as discriminatory depiction against black people, and occasionally include other racial discrimination.

The association have achieved following result from their achievement

* A total survey on publications with "black people" appearing have been conducted. In late 1990, the association have sent letters to all publishers, asking them to react accordingly before their given deadline. As a result, more than 300 volumes works have been ceased from publication for a period of time, including the like of "[[Kimba the White Lion]]", and the "Complete Collection of [[Osamu Tezuka]] Comic" which totaled to 300 volumes at a time was also affected.{{efn|After approximately a year of publication suspension, it was resumed from March 1992 March with an additional "Letter to readers" attached to it.}}
** The protest was noted in "Message from the editor" section at the end of the "Complete Collection of Osamu Tezuka Comic".
* In July 1990, the association have made a protest on the [[Obake no Q-tarō]], which include a chapter titled "International Obake Union", where an obake with an image of black people was depicted. As a result, some volumes have been recalled and ceased from publication.([[Jungle Kurobe]] was also recalled and ceased from publication at the same time, but whether such committee have been involved in the process is unknown.)&lt;ref&gt;安藤健二"封印作品の謎2" (太田出版, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Showpieces in [[Osamu Tezuka]] Exhibition are replaced as a result.

* In 2000, Iwanami Bunko's translation of "On the Edge of the Primeval Forest" by [[Albert Schweitzer|Albert Schiweitzer]] was demanded for shipment suspension because of allegedly discriminatory expressions against native population in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Asahi Shimbun 2000-12-12 朝刊 「「差別用語含む」市民団体指摘で岩波文庫が出荷停止」&lt;/ref&gt;
* The event was also reported in America, which gathered support from organizations against racial discrimination on black people, but as described in latter paragraph it have caused criticism among fans of the series and commentators who support freedom of expression.
* In 2002, they have again launched complain against Iwakuni Bunko for discriminatory expressions in [[Doctor Dolittle]].&lt;ref&gt;Asahi Shimbun 2002-02-04 Morning edition 「「ドリトル先生」回収論争　井伏鱒二氏翻訳に「差別的表現」」&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comments ==
As a result of their activities, [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] depictions of black people in media have become a [[taboo]], author, publishers and editors started to impose [[self-censorship]] onto their works. It have been stated that the association's activity have caused black people being censored from appearing on commercial media.

Also, as their protest caused publishers stopped printing some older words, they have drawn considerable amount of criticism from the society. Their demand have also been seen as infringement on freedom of expression.

These requests are not considered illegal because "infringement on freedom of expression" usually only applies to action pressed by authority or government. On top of it, the association also launched complaints against works that have minimal appearances of black people. Some works are able to survive their complaints by refusal to comply with their request, but in some other cases, these complaints have caused authors to seal and suspend production of their works.

In 1989 April volume of "Buraku Liberate", the deputy chairman of the association wrote that "The picture book is just a piece of merchandise that discriminates against black people. No matter how well known the book is among the general public and no matter how valuable it is literature, that still does not constitute an excuse against the fact." which maintain their position without allowing any compromises. However, in response to interview by Nishinihon Shimbun, the deputy chairman tries to claim they don't want to extinguish the picture book.&lt;ref&gt;「彼らも私も絶版を望んだわけではない。一緒に考えたかっただけだ」[http://www.nishinippon.co.jp/news/2005/sengo60/sengo6/01.html 西日本新聞－人権の居場所] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616090415/http://www.nishinippon.co.jp/news/2005/sengo60/sengo6/01.html |date=June 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But, when publishers are trying to discuss the incident with them, they have rejected to participate in such discussion. As of 2014, there is no public opinion available from them in any form of public communication channels like website or social network.

[[File:Fifes and Drums Vigilantes 1917 The Vigilantes.jpg|thumb|Publisher's design in ''Fifes and Drums Vigilantes'', 1917]]
'''The Vigilantes''' was a twentieth-century American publishing [[syndicate]]. Their pamphlets and newspapers were distributed with the intention of inspiring patriotism and [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] involvement in [[World War I]]. The membership was largely composed of men, who dominated its leadership, though much of the content was produced by women and appeared pseudonymously as the work of "the Vigilantes". A contemporary review noted the "breathless cries of song wrung mostly from the hearts of our women."&lt;ref name="Wienen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wienen|first=Mark W.

&lt;blockquote&gt;These poems, written under the immediate stress of great events by those who have banded themselves together under the name of The Vigilantes, furnish a striking record of the emotional reactions of the American people during the fortnight preceding and the six weeks following the declaration of war....&lt;ref&gt;From the foreword of ''[[s:Fifes and Drums]]'' (1917).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Politics of the Maldives}}

'''Vice President of the Maldives''' is the holder of a public office created by the [[Constitution of the Maldives]]. The current office-holder is [[Faisal Naseem]], since 17 November 2018.

[[Ibrahim Muhammad Didi]] was the first Vice President, and was an appointee, while [[Mohammed Waheed Hassan]] was the first elected Vice President. 

The Vice President is the first in the line of succession to the Presidency in the event of the President's death, resignation, or removal from office.

==The Office of the Vice President==
The post of the Vice President are described in article 112 of the constitution as follows:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Dheena Hussain. 2008 ''Functional Translation of the Constitution of the Maldives'', Male' Maldives.&lt;/ref&gt;
*There shall be a Vice President of the Maldives who shall assist the President in the discharge of his duties and responsibilities
*Every candidate for President shall publicly declare the name of the Vice President who will serve with him.
*The qualifications of office for the Vice President shall be the same as those for the President.
*If the office of the President becomes vacant for any reason, the Vice President shall succeed to the office of the President.

Articles 117 and 122 then goes on to describe the Responsibilities of the Vice President.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*The Vice President shall exercise such responsibilities and powers of the President as are delegated to him by the President.
*The Vice President shall perform the responsibilities of the President if the President is absent or temporarily unable to perform the responsibilities of office.
*If the office of Vice President becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, removal from office, permanent incapacity, or succession to the office of the President, the President shall appoint a new Vice President to serve the remainder of the term. The appointment shall be approved by the People’s Majlis.

As a result of these responsibilities, the Office of the Vice President and its duties are determined by the President. Under the current government, President Nasheed has charged the Vice President's office with implementing a plan to become Carbon Neutral by 2020, as well as to tackle a drug problem which affects more than half of the youth population.

==The First Vice President==
The first Vice President of the Maldives was [[Ibrahim Muhammad Didi]] of [[Rayyithunge Muthagaddim Party]], who was ''appointed'' to the position by President [[Mohamed Amin Didi]] (1 January 1953 to 2 September 1953). On the terms that the vacancy of the office of the [[President of the Maldives|President]] leads to the succession of the Vice President to presidency, Ibraahim Didi also served as acting president from 2 September 1953 to 7 March 1954 after the banishment of Mohamed Amin Didi.

[[Ibrahim Nasir]] appointed several of his cabinet ministers as Vice Presidents following the dismissal of Prime Minister [[Ahmed Zaki (politician)|Ahmed Zaki]]. 

The Maldives did not have Vice Presidents during the rule of [[Muhammad Fareed Didi]] and the Presidency of [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]].

==The First Elected Vice President==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1659">'''Úlfljótr''' brought law to Iceland and is regarded by some as [[Iceland]]'s first ''[[Lawspeaker#Iceland|lawspeaker]]''. In around 927-930 AD Úlfljótr was sent to [[Norway]] by a group of chieftains to study law and culture and bring back to Iceland sufficient understanding to help establish Iceland's legal framework and form of government.  And while he was in Norway, where he stayed for around three years, [[Grimur Geitskor]], Úlfljótr's half-brother, made a survey of Iceland to find the best place for the establishment of the [[Althing]]. Úlfljótr is commemorated with the first law enacted at the Alðing, Úlfljót's Law, with the [[Lake Úlfljótsvatn]] and by the [[Law review#Nordic countries|Úlfljótur Law Review]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thingvellir.is/english/history/settlement/ Thingvellir] (Accessed Feb 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ulfljotur.is/ Úlfljótur Law Review] (Access Feb 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nat.is/travelguideeng/plofin_lake_and_farm_ulfljotsvatn.htm Natural Iceland: Ulfljotsvatn] (Accessed Feb 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
