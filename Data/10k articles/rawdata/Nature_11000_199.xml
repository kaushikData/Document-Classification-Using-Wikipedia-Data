The '''12BV7''', '''12BY7''', '''12BY7A''', and equivalents were a class of medium-low gain, [[pentode]] [[vacuum tubes|vacuum tube]] amplifiers using the [[Tube socket#Noval base|Noval socket]] configuration. Although originally marketed as [[pentode]] tubes for use in early [[Television set|television receivers]], they found additional uses in audio and radiotelephone equipment. The series shares the EIA 9BF pinout with a number of other miniature pentode tubes of the era.

The most successful{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} tube in this series, 12BY7A was introduced by General Electric in June 1955&lt;ref name=ValveMuseum&gt;{{cite web|title=12BY7A @ The National Valve Museum|url=http://www.r-type.org/exhib/aas0006.htm|accessdate=Jan 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a demodulated video signal amplifier for television receivers. Its design specifications called for linear gain along a wide bandwidth (approximately 4&amp;nbsp;MHz) with low [[transconductance]] (13 [[Siemens (unit)|Millimhos]] (Millisiemens)) and high [[Sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]]. This combination of sensitivity, bandwidth and price lead to its popularity in audio amplification systems during the tube era.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Functional Equivalents ==
Like other vacuum tubes of US and Japanese manufacture, the [[RETMA tube designation]] system was used to designate identical tubes across different manufacturers. Any variations from the original electrical design specifications required a change to the tube designation code. As a result, a number of cross-reference resources exist.&lt;ref name=ValveMuseum /&gt;&lt;ref name=KitsEquivalent&gt;{{cite web|title=Tube Interchangibility Reference|url=http://www.nostalgickitscentral.com/info/tubexref12.html|website=Nostalgic Kits Central|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, multiple tube designation numbers were marked on the tube itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102730562|title=Computer History Museum - Vacuum tube type 12BY7A/12BV7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===12BY7===
12BY7 was an immediate successor to the 12BV7 and provided the same amplification values, but had slightly higher screen dissipation and voltage ratings. The tube also exhibited slightly lower transconductance ratings (11 mS vs the original specification of 13 mS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=12BV7 - GE Electronic Tubes reference, January 1959|url=http://www.datasheetarchive.com/dl/Scans-008/Scans-00172731.pdf|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===12BY7A===
The most popular variant from the original 12BV7 was the 12BY7A. In this case, the '''A''' suffix is used to indicate a backwards-compatible revision to the original specification. Specifically, the heater filament had been redesigned to further protect it from the potentially damaging voltage spikes which were known to occur when the tube heater circuits were wired in series rather than parallel. All of the other design specifications, including warmup time, were identical to the 12BY7.

===12DQ7===
The 12DQ7 was the final backwards compatible update to the 12BV7. It offered higher maximum screen and plate voltages of 330VAC. The transconductance value was further reduced from 11 mS to 10.5 mS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=12DQ7 - GE Electronic Tubes reference, April 1958|url=http://www.nj7p.org/Tubes/PDFs/Frank/093-GE/12DQ7.pdf|publisher=General Electric|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===7733===
The 7733 is listed as a premium version of the 12BY7A variant suitable for industrial or instrument service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_7733.html|title=7733, Tube 7733; Röhre 7733 ID6211, Vacuum Pentode}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EL180===
This is the European [[Mullard–Philips tube designation]] number for the 12BY7A variant. The code breakdown is as follows:
*'''E''' = Heated Cathode - Heater voltage = 6.3VAC, 6.3VDC Parallel, 12.6VDC Series
*'''L''' = Type of Device = Power tetrode, beam tetrode or power pentode
*'''180''' = Noval socket, B9A pinout.

== Usage Outside of Television Reception ==

===High-Fidelity Audio Equipment===
Although intended for video signal pre-amplification, the relatively high Mu to bandwidth ratio of the 12BY7 and 12BY7A variants lead to their adoption in audio amplification equipment during the [[High fidelity|Hi-Fi]] era. There is some dispute in the audio community as to whether the 12DQ7 and 12BV7 variants are acceptable substitutes when discussing the [[psychoacoustics]] of various amplifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Triode or Pentode|url=http://audiokarma.org/forums/index.php?threads/triode-or-pentode.187717/|website=AudioKarma.org|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Harman Kardon]] Citation II - Utilized six 12BY7As (three per audio channel) as pre-amplifiers driving four [[KT88]] tetrode final stage amplifiers (two per channel) in a [[Push–pull output|push-pull]] configuration. When driven to 60 Watts, this configuration resulted in approximately 40&amp;nbsp;kHz of [[audio frequency]] bandwidth (18&amp;nbsp;Hz - 40&amp;nbsp;kHz) extending into the [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic range]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harman Kardon Citation II|url=http://www.highfidelityreview.com/harman-kardon-citation-ii.html|website=High Fidelity Review|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citation II Operation Manual|url=http://www.manualslib.com/manual/564907/Harman-Kardon-Citation-Ii.html|website=ManualsLib.com|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harman Kardon Citation II|url=http://www.hifiengine.com/manual_library/harman-kardon/citation-ii.shtml|website=hifiengine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio Transceivers===
The tube series' wide-bandwidth characteristics lead a number of manufacturers&lt;ref name=k4eaa&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kemsi|first1=Ken|title=Kenwood Hybrid Transceiver FAQ|url=http://www.k4eaa.com/faq.htm|website=Kenwood Hybrid Transceiver Sales, Restoration &amp; Service|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TR4&gt;{{cite book|title=Instruction Manual TR-4 Sideband Transceiver|publisher=R. L. Drake Company|page=5|url=http://bama.edebris.com/manuals/drake/tr4/|accessdate=4 September 2015|ref=TR4}}&lt;/ref&gt; to utilize later variants, such as the 12BY7A as a transmit exciter and/or receive preamplifier in the RF stages of their radios. This RF design remained in use throughout the 1970s and early 1980s even as the other stages were replaced with [[Solid state (electronics)|Solid State]] components. Equipment using mixed tube &amp; solid-state technologies came to be known as "Hybrid" or "Hybrid Solid State".&lt;ref name="k4eaa"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44042">The '''ATP Rankings''' are the objective merit-based method used by the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP) for determining the qualification for entry as well as the seeding of players in all singles and doubles tournaments.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/-/media/files/rulebook/2017/2017-atp-rulebook_chapter-ix_31jan17.pdf |title=ATP World Tour - Rulebook, Chapter IX, ATP Rankings |date= |accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first rankings for singles were published on 23 August 1973 while the doubles players were ranked for the first time on 1 March 1976. Ranking points are awarded according to the stage of tournament reached, and the prestige of the tournament, with the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]]s awarding the most points. The rankings are updated every Monday, and points are dropped 52 weeks after being awarded (with the exception of the [[ATP Finals]], from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP World Tour event of the following year.

==History==
The ATP began as the men's [[trade union]] in 1972, through the combined efforts of [[Jack Kramer]], [[Cliff Drysdale]], and [[Donald Dell]], and rose to prominence when 81 of its members boycotted the [[1973 Wimbledon Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tignor|first1=Steve|title=1973: The men boycott Wimbledon and shift power to the players|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2015/03/1973-men-boycott-wimbledon-and-shift-power-players/54385/|accessdate=26 June 2016|publisher=tennis.com|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just two months later, in August, the ATP introduced its ranking system intended to objectify tournament entry criteria, which up to that point was controlled by national federations and tournament directors.&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt1"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rankings That Changed Tennis (Part I)|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/heritage-1973-atp-rankings-celebration-part-i|last1=Buddell|first1=James|publisher=atpworldtour.com|date=23 August 2013|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ATP's new ranking system was quickly adopted by men's tennis.&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt2"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rankings That Changed Tennis (Part II)|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/heritage-1973-atp-rankings-celebration-part-ii|last1=Buddell|first1=James|publisher=atpworldtour.com|date=23 August 2013|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While virtually all ATP members were in favor of objectifying event participation, the system's first No. 1, [[Ilie Năstase]], lamented that "everyone had a number hanging over them," fostering a more competitive and less collegial atmosphere among the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tignor|first1=Steve|title=1973: The ATP institutes computer rankings|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2015/03/1973-atp-institutes-computer-rankings/54439/|accessdate=26 June 2016|publisher=tennis.com|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original ATP ranking criteria, which persisted through the 1980s, was based on averaging each player's results, though the details were revised a number of times.&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt2"/&gt; Starting in 1990, in conjunction with the expansion of ATP purview as the new men's tour operator, the ranking criteria was replaced with a 'best of' system modeled after competitive downhill skiing.&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt2"/&gt; This 'best of' system originally used 14 events but expanded to 18 in 2000.&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt2"/&gt;

==Overview==
A player's ATP Ranking is based on the total points he accrued in the following 19 tournaments (18 if he did not qualify for the ATP Finals):
*The four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments
*The eight mandatory [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000]] tournaments,{{efn|In weeks where there are not four Grand Slam tournaments and eight ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournaments in the ranking period, the number of a player's best results from all eligible tournaments in the ranking period will be adjusted accordingly.}}
*The previous ATP Finals count until the Monday following the final regular-season ATP event of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx#yeartodate |title=Rankings FAQ |publisher=Atpworldtour.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The best six results from the non-mandatory ATP World Tour 1000, all [[ATP World Tour 500]], [[ATP World Tour 250]], [[ATP Challenger Tour]], [[Futures tournament|Futures Series]] and [[Davis Cup]] tournaments played in the calendar year{{efn|At least one of these tournaments must follow the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]].}}
The requirement to play in four ATP World Tour 500 events does not apply to a player who was outside the top 30 in the previous year-end ranking; however, no more than four of his results from 500 level events may be counted.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"/&gt; For a better result within the same tour type to be transposed one has to wait for the expiry of the first worse result from previous year. It only expires at the drop date of that tournament and only if the player reached a worse result or has not entered the current year.

Ranking points gained in a tournament are dropped 52 weeks later, with the exception of the [[ATP Finals]], from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP World Tour event of the following year.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"/&gt;

The [[Monte-Carlo Masters]] 1000 became optional in 2009, but if a player chooses to participate in it, its result is counted and his fourth-best result in an ATP 500 event is ignored (his three best ATP 500 results remain). From 2009 until 2015, if a player did not play enough ATP 500 events and did not have an ATP 250 or Challenger appearance with a better result, the Davis Cup was counted in the 500's table.&lt;ref name=DC&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|work=atpworldtour.com|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx#daviscup|date=|accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Team Cup]] was also included before its cancellation in 2012.

For the Davis Cup, from 2009 until 2015, points were distributed for the World Group countries. Instead of having an exact drop date they were gradually updated at each phase of the competition, comparing the player's results with his results from the previous year. E.g. if a player played two matches in a semifinal but plays one the next year only that one missing match will be extracted from his points).&lt;ref name=DC /&gt;

A player who is out of competition for 30 or more days, due to a verified injury, will not receive any penalty. The ATP Finals will count as an additional 19th tournament in the ranking of its eight qualifiers at season's end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=ATP World Tour |title=Rankings-FAQ |url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For every Grand Slam tournament or mandatory ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournament for which a player is not in the main draw, and was not (and, in the case of a Grand Slam tournament, would not have been, had he and all other players entered) a main draw direct acceptance on the original acceptance list, and never became a main draw direct acceptance, the number of his results from all other eligible tournaments in the ranking period that count for his ranking is increased by one.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"/&gt;

Once a player is accepted in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament or ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournament,{{efn|"Accepted" means a direct acceptance, a qualifier, a special exempt, or a lucky loser, or having accepted a wild card.}} his result in this tournament counts for his ranking, regardless of whether he participates. A player's withdrawal from an ATP World Tour 500 event, regardless of whether the withdrawal was on time, results in a zero point included as one of his best of four results. Further non-consecutive withdrawals results in a zero point allocation replacing the next best positive result for each additional withdrawal.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"/&gt;

Players with multiple consecutive withdrawals who are out of competition for 30 days or longer because of injury are not subject to a ranking penalty as long as verified and approved medical forms are provided; or, a player will not have the ranking penalty imposed if he completes the Promotional Activities requirement as specified under "Repeal of Withdrawal Fines and/or Penalties" or if the on-site withdrawal procedures apply.  Players may also appeal withdrawal penalties to a Tribunal who will determine whether the penalties are affirmed or set aside.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"/&gt;

Between 2000 and 2012, ranking points were awarded based on results in the Summer Olympics. This was changed before the 2016 Olympics where no ranking points were awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/30/sports/tennis/points-and-prize-money-mean-more-to-olympic-tennis-holdouts.html|title=Points and Prize Money Mean More to Olympic Tennis Holdouts|last=Rothenberg|first=Ben|date=2016-05-29|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With these rules, a player playing and winning the mandatory 4 Grand Slams and 8 ATP Masters 1000 events, a further 5 ATP 500 events and the [[Monte-Carlo Masters]] 1000 can amass a total of 19,500 points before the ATP Finals and end the calendar year with a maximum of 21,000 points.

Since the introduction of the ATP rankings the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Douglas Robson|title=Happy 40th birthday, ATP computer rankings|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2013/08/19/atp-computer-rankings-turn-40/2674637/|publisher=USA Today|date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Simon Cambers |title=40 years on, how have the ATP World Rankings developed? |url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2013-02-15/201302151360936685683.html |website=www.wimbledon.com |publisher=[[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|AELTC]] |date=15 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231175147/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2013-02-15/201302151360936685683.html |archivedate=2014-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Points distribution (2009 – present)===

{{ATP Entry Ranking Points Distribution 2009}}

*(ATP 1000 series) Qualifying points changes to 16 points only if the main draw is larger than 56.
*(ATP 500 series) Qualifying points changes to 10 points only if the main draw is larger than 32
*(ATP 250 series) Qualifying points changes to 10 points only if the main draw is larger than 32
*Players who draw a bye in the first round in the ATP 1000 series and lose their first match in the second round are considered to have lost their first round and receive the points equivalent to first round loss. Similarly, loss in the second round of the ATP 500 series and the ATP 250 series after drawing bye in first round will result in 0 points being awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/-/media/files/rulebook/2017/2017-atp-rulebook_chapter-ix.pdf |title=ATP World Tour 2017 Rulebook |publisher=ATP World Tour }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition qualifiers and main draw entry players will then also receive the points in brackets for the rounds they reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx?#points |title=Tennis - ATP World Tour - Rankings FAQ |publisher=ATP World Tour |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2016, points were no longer awarded for [[Davis Cup]] ties,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/rankings/rankings-faq|title=Rankings {{!}} FAQ {{!}} ATP World Tour {{!}} Tennis|newspaper=ATP World Tour|language=en|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor for the tennis tournament at the Summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennisworldusa.org/news/news/ATP_Tennis/27978/itf-confirms-no-atp-points-will-be-assigned-at-olympic-games-in-rio-2016/|title=ITF confirms no ATP points will be assigned at Olympic Games in Rio 2016|newspaper=Tennis World|language=en|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4421">'''Ambiguity resolution''' is used to find the value of a measurement that requires [[modulo operation|modulo]] sampling.

This is required for [[pulse-Doppler radar]] signal processing.

==Measurements==

Some types of measurements introduce an unavoidable '''[[modulo operation]]''' in the measurement process. This happens with all [[radar]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol39-1960/articles/bstj39-4-809.pdf|title=The Design of Radar Signals Having Both High Range Resolution and High Velocity Resolution|publisher=Alcatel-Lucent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radar [[aliasing]] happens when:
* [[Pulse repetition frequency]] (PRF) is too low to sample Doppler frequency directly
* PRF is too high to sample range directly

Pulse Doppler sonar uses similar principles to measure position and velocity involving liquids.

===Radar Systems===
Radar systems operating at a PRF below about 3&amp;nbsp;kHz pulse rate produce true range, but produce ambiguous target speed. Radar systems operating at a PRF above 30&amp;nbsp;kHz produce true target speed, but produce ambiguous target range.

Medium PRF systems produce both ambiguous range measurement and ambiguous radial speed measurement using PRF from 3&amp;nbsp;kHz to 30&amp;nbsp;kHz.

Ambiguity resolution finds true range and true speed by using ambiguous range and ambiguous speed measurements with multiple PRF.

===Doppler Measurements===
Doppler systems involve velocity measurements similar to the kind of measurements made using a strobe light.

For example, a strobe light can be used as a tachometer to measure rotational velocity for rotating machinery. Strobe light measurements can be inaccurate because the light may be flashing 2 or 3 times faster than shaft rotation speed. The user can only produce an accurate measurement by increasing the pulse rate starting near zero until pulses are fast enough to make the rotating object appear stationary.

Radar and sonar systems use the same phenomenon to detect target speed.

==Operation==
The ambiguity region is shown graphically in this image. The x axis is range (left-right). The y axis is radial speed. The z axis is amplitude (up-down). The shape of the rectangles changes when the PRF changes.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Range Ambiguity Resolution for High PRF Pulse-Doppler radar|publisher=The Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System | bibcode=1985inra.conf..113P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pulse-doppler ambiguity zones.png|thumb|Pulse-Doppler ambiguity zones. Each blue zone with no label represents a velocity/range combination that will be folded into the unambiguous zone. Areas outside the blue zones are blind ranges and blind velocities, which are filled in using multiple PRF and frequency agility.]]The unambiguous zone is in the lower left corner. All of the other blocks have ambiguous range or ambiguous radial velocity.

Pulse Doppler radar relies on medium pulse repetition frequency (PRF) from about 3&amp;nbsp;kHz to 30&amp;nbsp;kHz. Each transmit pulse is separated by between 5&amp;nbsp;km and 50&amp;nbsp;km of distance.

===Range Ambiguity Resolution===

The received signals from multiple PRF are compared using the [[range ambiguity resolution]] process.

Each range sample is converted from time domain I/Q samples into frequency domain. Older systems use individual filters for frequency filtering. Newer systems use digital sampling and a [[Fast Fourier transform]] or [[Discrete Fourier transform]] instead of physical filters. Each filter converts time samples into a frequency spectrum. Each spectrum frequency corresponds with a different speed. These samples are thresholded to obtain ambiguous range for several different PRF.

===Frequency Ambiguity Resolution===

The received signals are also compared using the [[frequency ambiguity resolution]] process.

A blind velocity occurs when Doppler frequency falls close to the PRF. This folds the return signal into the same filter as stationary clutter reflections. Rapidly alternating different PRF while scanning eliminates blind frequencies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2304">The '''Association for Women Geoscientists''' is a professional organization which promotes the professional development of its members, provides geoscience outreach to girls, and encourages women to become geoscientists. Membership is open to all who support AWG's goals. Members include professional women and men from [[industry]], [[government]], [[museum]]s and [[academia]], students from a cross-section of colleges and universities, retirees, and others interested in supporting the society's goals.

== History ==
AWG was founded in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] in 1977. The original purpose of the society was to provide encouragement to women in the [[geosciences]], a career choice where they were largely underrepresented at the time. Today, the purpose remains the same, though some advances have been made, as AWG membership approaches 1200 students and scientists, reflecting the increasing participation of women in the geosciences. AWG is a 501(c)(6) mutual benefit corporation with local chapters in many cities and at-Large members throughout the U.S. and around the world.

== Notable members ==
* [[Claudia Alexander]]
* [[Francisca Oboh Ikuenobe]]
* [[Sharon Mosher]]
* [[Sarah K. Noble]]

== Activities ==
The society provides and sponsors several programs that strive to achieve the goals of the society:
* The Association for Women Geoscientsts Distinguished Lecturer Program is a list of female geoscientists available to give talks or lectures on their areas of interest. [http://www.awg.org/AWG_PPDLP/ ''List of speakers'']
* [http://www.awg.org/eas/scholarships.html Scholarships]

{{Quran}}
'''Sūrat aṭ-Ṭūr''' ({{lang-ar|سورة الطور}}, "The Mount") is the 52nd sura of the [[Qur'an]] with 49 [[ayat]]. The surah that opens with the oath of the Divine One swearing by the Mount of Sinai, where the [[Torah]] was revealed to [[Moses]]. It takes its name from "the mount" (''ṭūr'') mentioned in Ayah#1. The surah which addresses many of the arguments put to the Prophet by the disbelievers of [[Mecca]] (ayah#29 ff.). The bliss that will be enjoyed by the believers is contrasted to the torments of [[Hell]], and the Prophet is urged to bide his time, to continue to deliver his message, and to wait with confidence for God’s judgement. God swears by, among other things, [[Mount Sinai]], that the Day of Judgement is inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20131226123623/http://www.quranse.org/QueryEngine/index.php?Cmd=P&amp;FromCmd=AS&amp;b=Qur&amp;c=52&amp;v1=1&amp;v2=49&amp;DP=1&amp;DG=1&amp;QtID3=frchiadmi&amp;QtID4=pickthall&amp;BtID0=esv&amp;BL=en Surah At-Tur (complete text in Arabic with English and French translations)]; accessed 25 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
===Energy===
The Initiative aims to enhance integration of the energy markets of participating countries with the EU [[energy market]] so as to create transparent energy markets, capable of attracting investment as well as enhancing security of energy supply.&lt;ref name=ens/&gt;&lt;ref name=wunderlich&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of the initiative are harmonisation of legal and technical standards so as to create a functioning integrated energy market in accordance with EU and international legal and regulatory frameworks; increasing the safety and security of energy supplies by extending and modernising existing infrastructure; substituting old and inefficient power generation infrastructures with environmentally friendly power generation infrastructures; developing new infrastructures and implementing a modern monitoring system of their operation; improvement of energy supply and demand management through the integration of efficient and sustainable energy systems; and promoting the financing of commercially and environmentally viable energy projects of common interest. A road map to achieve these objectives was adopted at the Astana Ministerial Conference.&lt;ref name=icbss/&gt;&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;&lt;ref name=amineh&gt;

These activities were financed through the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] and the [[European Investment Bank]].&lt;ref name=youngs/&gt;

===Transport===
According to the EU Transport Directorate, 'The Baku Initiative aims to give an impulse to Trans-European transport cooperation on the basis of the mutual interest for the progressive integration of their respective transport networks and markets in accordance with EU and international legal and regulatory frameworks. It provides a supportive framework for TRACECA to foster the reflection on the cooperation between the EU-Black Sea/Caspian littoral States and their Neighbours, and to ensure the consistency with the EU priorities in the context of its Neighbourhood Policy.

Following the conclusions reached at the EU-Caspian region Transport Ministerial Conference on 14 November 2004 in Baku, 4 expert working groups have been created (aviation, security in all modes of transport, road and rail transport, transport infrastructure).'&lt;ref name="Baku Initiative"/&gt;

Following the Sofia meeting in 2006, a fifth working group was added, dealing with maritime transport.

==Partner countries of the Baku Initiative==
The partner countries of the transport and energy aspects and issues of the Baku Initiative are listed below. Aside from Turkey, the majority of the members are the [[Post-Soviet states|former]] [[Republics of the Soviet Union|republics]] of the [[Soviet Union]]:&lt;ref name=tonus/&gt;&lt;ref name=gheorghe/&gt;&lt;ref name=ens/&gt;

==Structure==
The European Union follows the progress of the Baku Initiative through the [[European Commission]] (Directorate General for Transport &amp; Energy; Directorate General for External Relations, and EuropeAid Cooperation Office). The [[INOGATE]] Technical Secretariat (which is located in [[Kiev]], with a regional office in [[Tbilisi]] covering the [[Caucasus]]) co-ordinates the energy aspects on behalf of the Commission and the [[TRACECA]] Secretariat, (which is located in Baku with a regional office in [[Odessa]]) performs the same function for the transport aspects.&lt;ref name=talus&gt;

==Critics==
Some experts, e.g. Frank Umbach of Centre for European Security Strategies, have criticised the Baku Initiative and other policies towards the Caspian region for concentrating too much on the technical cooperation instead of seeking a more strategic long-term cooperation.&lt;ref name=umbach&gt;

'''Blue Knob State Park''' is a {{convert|6128|acre|adj=on}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Kimmel Township, Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Kimmel]], [[Lincoln Township, Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Lincoln]], and [[Pavia Township, Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Pavia]] townships in [[Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Bedford County]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the United States.&lt;ref name="bksp" /&gt; The average annual snowfall at the park is about {{convert|12|ft|cm}}. The park is named for [[Blue Knob (Pennsylvania)|Blue Knob]], the second highest mountain in Pennsylvania at {{convert|3146|ft}}.&lt;ref name="bksp" /&gt; It is the location of [[Blue Knob All Seasons Resort]], the ski slope in Pennsylvania with the highest elevation. Blue Knob State Park is just off [[Interstate 99]] on [[Pennsylvania Route 869]] west of [[Pavia, Pennsylvania|Pavia]].

==History==
The earliest settlers to the Blue Knob area were of [[Germany|German]] descent. They cleared and farmed the land soon after the [[American Revolution]]. They also built several [[distillery|distilleries]], a [[lumber mill]] and [[gristmill]].&lt;ref name="bksp"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/blueknob/index.htm| title = Blue Knob State Park

The logging boom that swept over most of the mountains and forests of Pennsylvania drastically altered the landscape surrounding Blue Knob State Park. The [[old-growth forest]]s of [[Tsuga canadensis|hemlock]] were [[clearcutting|clear cut]]. The timber was hauled away on [[train]]s that climbed the steep hillsides. A [[railroad]] that followed [[Bobs Creek (Pennsylvania)|Bobs Creek]] used six switchbacks to ascend the mountain. Another railroad used five switchbacks to climb the hills near [[Wallacks Branch]]. These railroad grades are still used today to gain access to State Gamelands. The train tracks have since been removed and replaced with hiking trails.&lt;ref name="bksp"/&gt;

The lumber industry abandoned the lands once all the salable timber had been harvested. They left behind a wasteland of dried out tree tops that were ignited by passing [[steam locomotive]]s. The land was scarred by immense wild fires. The wildlife that had once thrived in the area was also gone due to over-hunting and deforestation.&lt;ref name="bksp"/&gt;

The efforts of the [[National Park Service]] are largely responsible for the reforestation of Blue Knob State Park. Blue Knob National Recreation Demonstration Area was opened by the park service in 1935. The park was built by the men of the [[Works Projects Administration]] and the young men of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] with the cooperation of Pennsylvania Governor [[Gifford Pinchot]]. The WPA and CCC were established by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during the [[Great Depression]] to provide work for the unemployed. Ownership of the park was transferred to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on September 26, 1945 and Blue Knob State Park was officially opened.&lt;ref name="bksp"/&gt;

==Geology==
The bedrock in the valleys of the park consists of the Upper [[Devonian]] Catskill Formation, consisting of sequences of sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  The mountains in the park are capped by the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] Burgoon Sandstone, which is underlain by the transitional [[Devonian]]-[[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] Rockwell Formation, consisting of crossbedded argillacious sandstone with some shale beds.&lt;ref name="bksp"/&gt;

===The resort===
Blue Knob All Seasons Resort is on [[Blue Knob]] the second highest mountain in Pennsylvania. The resort was opened on the site of a former military base. The resort includes 36 trails on slopes for [[skiing]], [[snow board]]ing and tubing, a [[golf course]], trails for [[mountain biking]] and [[cross-country skiing]]. It is open year-round. The lodge provides year-round accommodations with [[tennis court]]s and a [[swimming pool]].&lt;ref name="bksp"/&gt;

===Swimming===
There is a swimming pool at the park that is separate from the pool at the resort. It opens [[Memorial Day]] weekend and closes [[Labor Day]] weekend. The hours of operation are 11:00 am until 7:00 pm. [[Lifeguard]]s are provided.&lt;ref name="bksp"/&gt;

===Picnics===
There are three [[picnic]] areas at Blue Knob State Park with over 200 [[picnic table]]s. Mowery Hollow and Burnt House picnic areas are open year-round. Willow Springs picnic area opens the weekend before Memorial Day and closes the day after [[Thanksgiving]].&lt;ref name="bksp"/&gt;

===Camping===
Blue Knob State Park has a [[campground]] with 45 sites, 25 of which have connections to an electrical supply. 43 sites will accommodate tents or campers. Two of the sites are walk-in only. The campground has running water, a sanitary dump station, modern restrooms and a [[playground]].&lt;ref name="bksp"/&gt;

A group of [[Log cabin|cabin]]s, built and used by the CCC, is available for rent by large groups. The cabin area has a large dining hall and kitchen area and a showerhouse.&lt;ref name="bksp"/&gt;

===Hunting and fishing===
[[Hunting]] is permitted on about {{convert|5000|acre}} of Blue Knob State Park. The most common game species are [[Wild turkey|turkey]], [[Eastern gray squirrel|squirrels]] and [[white-tailed deer]].  The hunting of [[groundhog]]s is prohibited. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the [[Pennsylvania Game Commission]]. The park is next to Pennsylvania State Game Land 26. There are parking lots and trails at Blue Knob State Park for those interested parking at the state park and hiking into the gamelands.&lt;ref name="bksp"/&gt;

===Trails===

Blue Knob contains a vast network of hiking trails that range from easy walks to difficult and challenging day hikes. The total network of trails is approximately 18 miles in length. Most of these trails are multiple use for hiking, cross country skiing, mountain biking, horseback riding and snowmobiling. Below is a brief description of each trail that can be found on the mountain.

'''Mountain View Trail'''

This trail is 5 miles in length and one of the more difficult on the mountain. It is marked with a double red blaze and the trailhead can be found on the Tower Road just below the summit. The Mountain View Trail begins at about the 3,000&amp;nbsp;ft. contour and begins by looping around a gentle grade on the upper portion of the mountain's east shoulder. This part of the mountain is marked by stunted and wind deformed trees, mainly scrub oak and striped maple. Also large slabs of the conglomerate rocks that form this mountain may be seen strewn about on these upper slopes. This trail passes two lookouts, the Pavia Overlook and the Queen Overlook before descending into the Beaverdam Creek drainage and the lowest portion of this trail at the 2,000&amp;nbsp;ft. contour. The trail then traverses the east face of the mountain to the Willow Springs picnic area before it begins its steep ascent on the west face of the mountain and back to the trailhead.

'''Three Springs Trail'''

This trail is 2 miles in length and follows an old roadbed. The trail is wide and good for snowmobiles and horseback riding. This trail can be accessed from the Mountain View Trail at about the 3,050&amp;nbsp;ft. contour and generally runs downslope before it bisects the east face, and ends at the 2,500&amp;nbsp;ft. contour where it junctions once again with the Mountain View Trail. Along its length you can see how the trail got its name by the number of springs that are used for supplying water to the villages below the mountain.

'''Rock N' Ridge Trail'''

This trail begins at the 1,550&amp;nbsp;ft. contour just above the gated entrance to the park headquarters. It is 2.8 miles in length and marked by an inverted blue "T". The trail is located on the west side of the mountain and begins by following a ridge that abuts the main dome of the mountain. On this trail you may see mountain laurel which is the Pennsylvania State Flower. When the mountain laurel blooms in June it makes for a very scenic hike. The trail eventually junctions into the Sawmill trail at the 2,400&amp;nbsp;ft. contour, before this however, the trail has a turnoff which will descend down the Pavia Run drainage and end at the Mowry Hollow Picnic Area.

'''Sawmill Trail'''

The Sawmill Trail crosses the west face of the mountain and is 3 miles in length marked by yellow blazes. This is another wide trail that follows an old roadbed and is conducive to snowmobiles and mountain biking. The trailheads are located at either end of the trail off the Knob Road or on State Route 403 on Ickes Hill. If you begin on Ickes Hill, you will begin ascending the southwest buttress of the mountain to the Willow Springs Picnic Area at the 2,250&amp;nbsp;ft. contour. From there you will navigate shortly on the Mountain View Trail before you again pick up the Sawmill Trail. The trail moves across the hollows of the mountain at approximately the 2,400&amp;nbsp;ft. contour before it ends at that north end of Chappell Field and the trail head on the Knob Road. This hike takes you through rich hardwoods and passes over mountain seeps which drain from the upper slopes of the mountain, it is one of the easier hikes in the park.

'''Homestead Trail'''

This trail is a small loop at 1.8 miles in length and marked by orange blazes. The Homestead Trail may be gained by access off the Whysong Road or by a connector trail off the Sawmill Trail. The hike is on the lower portions of the mountain and only gains to the 2,100&amp;nbsp;ft. contour. The trail is easy and wide open and as its name suggests, marks the site of an old settlers house site. Hiking along this pathway affords good opportunities for viewing wildlife.

'''Chappell's Field Trail'''

The Chappell's Field Trail is accessible at points on the Knob Road and campground areas. The trail is located on one of the main ridges that are found on the west side of the mountain. On the top of this ridge, which is over 2,400&amp;nbsp;ft., Chapell's Field holds one of the best views in the park as it looks up at the main summit of Blue Knob and down on the valley below. The trail encircles the top of this ridge and is 2.5 miles in length, a loop marked by inverted orange "V" blazes.

'''Crist Ridge Trail'''

The 1.9 mile orange blazed trail connects to the Chappell's Field Trail at the 2,250&amp;nbsp;ft. contour and winds its way down the ridge ending on the Knob Road. This trail had large areas of blowdowns on it following the wind events in September 2004. Since then the trail has been cleared and is a good trail for mountain biking and cross country skiing. In the winter with the foliage down, views of Blue Knob Mountain can be seen through the trees.

'''Lost Turkey Trail'''

This is the longest and most difficult trail at 26 miles long. The trail begins on 3,034 foot Herman Point and is marked by red blazes. The trail crosses over both public and private lands as it eventually ends in neighboring Somerset County. To begin this hike you must proceed up the Tower Road and pass by the gated road which leads to Herman Point and the transmitter towers on its summit. Just behind the fenced in towers, you can see the trail which proceeds down the steep face of the mountain into the Rhodes Run drainage. From here the trail follows Ciana Run before crossing Hogback ridge, then beginning its steep ascent up Forks Ridge and the Allegheny Front beyond. Once on top of the Allegheny Plateau it winds its way through high elevation forests and mountain bogs. Proper footwear is recommended for this hike as it is steep in some areas and stream crossings are required along its length.

'''Connector Trails'''

There are several connector trails that make up the remaining mileage on Blue Knob's trails system. They are double blue blazed markings and vary in length and difficulty.

Bobs Creek is [[fish stocking|stocked]] with [[trout]] by the [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]] in co-operation with the Pavia Sportsmen Club Inc.  There is also a population of native [[brook trout]] in Bobs Creek and its tributaries.&lt;ref name="bksp"/&gt;

'''Blue Spring State Park''' is a [[state park]] located west of [[Orange City, Florida|Orange City]], [[Florida]] in the [[United States]]. The park is a popular tourist destination; available activities include canoeing, [[SCUBA diving]], kayaking, fishing, camping, hiking, wildlife watching, and swimming. The spring is the largest on the [[St. Johns River]] and with a relatively warm temperature of {{Convert|73|F|C}}, the spring attracts many Florida [[manatee]]s during the winter months. {{convert|102|e6USgal|m3}} of water flow out of Blue Spring into the St. Johns River every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.floridasprings.org/downloads/florida_12_awhtxsw4.pdf|publisher=United States Geological Survey|title=Volusia Blue Spring|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The spring was visited by botanist [[John Bartram]] in 1766.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-07-02/travel/orl-travel-blue-spring-state-park-story_1_louis-thursby-blue-spring-state-park-native-americans Florida Springs Guide: Blue Spring State Park], July 2, 2013, [[Orlando Sentinel]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The spring and surrounding land was acquired by the Weismore family in the mid-19th century and a [[Louis P. Thursby House|large plantation-style home]] built upon a shell mound on the property. The area seemed to be excellent for cultivation of citrus fruit, and a small railway was built linking [[Orange City, Florida|Orange City]] to the dock at Blue Spring. Ultimately, the [[Florida East Coast Railway]] was constructed not far from the present-day park. A killing freeze occurred in the 1890s, wiping out area citrus groves and driving the industry south. The Thursbys switched to the tourist trade, taking advantage of the beautiful spring and excellent fishing and hunting opportunities along the [[St. Johns River]].

The park was acquired by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection in 1972 to kick-start its manatee protection program.

==Recreation==
[[File:Blue Spring State Park Thursby sign01.jpg|thumb|Thursby House]]
Blue Spring State Park has a lot to offer its visitors including, but not limited to, fifty-one campsites with water and electricity hookups, and six cabins which are available for those who wish to stay at the park. The crystal clear spring runs a few miles long where swimming and tubing are very popular on hot summer days but are not allowed during manatee season. Qualified Scuba divers can descend into the spring cave in season as well. Picnicking is a popular pastime, with multiple pavilions available for groups and scattered picnic tables around the entire park. The park also features volleyball courts and a playground, as well as, canoeing, kayaking, and fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.floridastateparks.org/park/Blue-Spring|title=Florida State Parks|website=www.floridastateparks.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old Thursby plantation house is being maintained and has historical displays that visitors can explore. Various wildlife besides manatees can be seen as well including alligators, bears, racoons, and various species of birds. [[Hontoon Island State Park]] is a short paddle down the St. Johns River. Hours of operation, fees, and rental information can be found here: https://www.floridastateparks.org/park/Blue-Spring

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2622">{{Marxism}}
'''Centrism''' has a specific meaning within the [[Marxist]] movement, referring to a position between [[revolution]] and [[reformism]]. For instance, the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD) and [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) were both seen as centrist because they oscillated between advocating reaching a [[socialist economy]] through reforms and advocating revolution. The parties that belonged to the "so-called" [[Two-and-a-half International|Two-and-a-half]] and [[Three-and-a-half International]]s, who could not choose between the [[reformism]] of the [[social democrat]] [[Second International]] and the revolutionary politics of the [[Communist]] [[Third International]], were also exemplary of centrism in this sense. They included the Spanish Workers' Party of Marxist Unification ([[POUM]]), the ILP and [[Poale Zion]]. 

For [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] and other revolutionary Marxists, the term "centrist" in this sense has a pejorative association. They often describe centrism in this sense as [[Opportunism|opportunistic]] since it argues for a revolution at some point in the future, but urges reformist practices in the meantime. [[Libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]] and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] also tend to view any reformism as political opportunism because they view reformism as being incapable of effecting structural changes to social organization.&lt;ref name=sdvrds&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/vote/vote2.html Socialism or Social democracy?] Anarchism WebSite.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The term "centrism" also denotes positions held by some of the [[Bolsheviks]] during the 1920s. In this context, "centrism" refers to a position between the [[Right Opposition]], which supported the [[New Economic Policy]] and friendly relations with capitalist countries; and the [[Left Opposition]], which supported an immediate transition to a [[socialist economy]] and [[world revolution]]. By the end of the 1920s, the two opposing factions had been defeated by [[Joseph Stalin]], who eventually gained enough support from members of both factions through the application of various ideas formulated by the factions' various leaders, notably [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]].

'''''Chamaecyparis pisifera''''' ('''Sawara cypress''' or '''Sawara''' {{lang-ja|サワラ |translit=Sawara}}) is a species of [[Chamaecyparis|false cypress]], native to central and southern [[Japan]], on the islands of [[Honshū]] and [[Kyūshū]].&lt;ref name=farjon&gt;Farjon, A. (2005). ''Monograph of Cupressaceae and Sciadopitys''. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. {{ISBN|1-84246-068-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iucn&gt;{{IUCN2006|assessor=Conifer Specialist Group|year=1998|id=42213|title=Chamaecyparis pisifera|downloaded=12 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a slow-growing [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] [[tree]] growing to 35–50 m tall with a trunk up to 2 m in diameter. The [[bark (botany)|bark]] is red-brown, vertically fissured and with a stringy texture. The foliage is arranged in flat sprays; adult [[leaf|leaves]] are scale-like, 1.5–2&amp;nbsp;mm long, with pointed tips (unlike the blunt tips of the leaves of the related ''[[Chamaecyparis obtusa]]'' (hinoki cypress), green above, green below with a white [[stoma]]tal band at the base of each scale-leaf; they are arranged in opposite decussate pairs on the shoots. The juvenile leaves, found on young seedlings, are needle-like, 4–8&amp;nbsp;mm long, soft and glaucous bluish-green. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are globose, 4–8&amp;nbsp;mm diameter, with 6–10 scales arranged in opposite pairs, maturing in autumn about 7–8 months after pollination.&lt;ref name=farjon/&gt;

The Latin [[binomial nomenclature|specific epithet]] ''pisifera'', “pea-bearing”, refers to the small round green cones.&lt;ref name=RHSLG&gt;{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Lorraine |title=RHS Latin for Gardeners |year=2012 |publisher=Mitchell Beazley |location=United Kingdom |isbn=184533731X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related cypress found on [[Taiwan]], ''[[Chamaecyparis formosensis]]'' (Formosan cypress), differs in longer ovoid cones 6–10&amp;nbsp;mm long with 10–16 scales.&lt;ref name=farjon/&gt; The extinct [[Eocene]] species ''[[Chamaecyparis eureka]]'', known from fossils found on [[Axel Heiberg Island]] in Canada, is noted to be very similar to ''C. pisifera''.&lt;ref name="Kotyk2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kotyk |first1=M.E.A. |author2=Basinger, J.F.|author3=McIlver, E.E. |year=2003 |title=Early Tertiary ''Chamaecyparis'' Spach from Axel Heiberg Island, Canadian High Arctic |journal= Canadian Journal of Botany |volume=81 |pages=113–130 |doi= 10.1139/B03-007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
It is grown for its timber in Japan, where it is used as a material for building [[palace]]s, [[temple]]s, shrines and baths, and making [[coffin]]s, though less valued than the timber of ''C. obtusa''. The wood is lemon-scented and light-colored with a rich, straight grain, and is rot resistant.&lt;ref name=dj&gt;Dallimore, W., &amp; Jackson, A. B. (1966). ''A Handbook of Coniferae and Ginkgoaceae'' 4th ed. Arnold.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a popular ornamental tree in [[park]]s and [[garden]]s, both in Japan and elsewhere in [[temperate]] climates including western [[Europe]] and parts of [[North America]]. A large number of [[cultivar]]s have been selected for garden planting, including dwarf forms, forms with yellow or blue-green leaves, and forms retaining the juvenile needle-like foliage; particularly popular juvenile foliage cultivars include 'Plumosa', 'Squarrosa' and 'Boulevard'.&lt;ref name=dj/&gt;

'''Charles Kenneth Johnson''' (July 24, 1924 – March 19, 2001) was, from 1972 until his death, the president of the [[International Flat Earth Research Society]], which he and his wife ran from their home in [[California]]. He claimed that the [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] [[moon landing]]s, and [[space exploration]] in general, were faked to lead people away from the [[biblical]] truth that the [[flat earth|world was flat]].

Originally an airplane mechanic in San Francisco, Johnson took over the Society from [[Samuel Shenton]] on the latter's death in 1972, from his ranch, near [[Edwards Air Force Base]].

In his obituary, Tim Bullamore wrote, "Although the world at large was slow to accept his work, Johnson remained cheerful and unruffled. He enjoyed smoking a cigar while watching the sun set over the flat desert. He was regularly interviewed by curious journalists and was often invited to speak about his subject. He received large quantities of mail, not all of it ridiculing his work, and on one occasion he starred in an ice-cream advertisement." &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071212095743/http://theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=11.0 theflatearthsociety.org (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date of the festival==

Chhath puja is performed on ''Kartika Shukla Shashthi'', which is the sixth day of the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]] in the [[Vikram Samvat]]. This falls typically in the month of October or November in the Gregorian English Calendar. It is also celebrated in the month of Chaitra.

==Chhath Puja 2018 Dates==

Chhath puja is on the 13th(evening ) &amp; 14th(sunrise) of November 2018. The four-day festival will start from  11 November and will end on 14 November.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

It is also celebrated in the summer (March–April), on [[Chaitra]] Shashthi, some days after [[Holi]]; this event is called ''Chaiti Chhath''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jaibihar.com/chaiti-chhath-to-start-today/5784 |title=Chaiti Chhath to start today |work=Jai Bihar |date=30 March 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104000540/http://jaibihar.com/chaiti-chhath-to-start-today/5784/ |archivedate=4 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chhath is an arduous observance, requiring the worshipers to fast without a sip of water for around 36 hours continuously.

==Etymology==
The word ''chhath'' means ''sixth'' {{citation needed|date=January 2018}} in [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]] and [[Bhojpuri]] languages and the festival is celebrated on the sixth day of the month [[Kārtika]] of the Hindu luni-solar [[Bikram Sambat]] calendar. The word is a [[Prakrit]] derivation from the Sanskrit ''ṣaṣṭhi'', meaning ''sixth''.It is the longest and most important festival after navratri.

==History==
It is believed that the ritual of Chhath puja may date back to the ancient [[Vedas|Vedic]] texts, as the [[Rigveda]] contains hymns worshiping the Sun god and describes similar rituals. The rituals also find reference in the [[Sanskrit]] [[Indian epic poetry|epic]] poem ''[[Mahābhārata]]'' in which [[Draupadi]] is depicted as observing similar rites.

In the poem, Draupadi and the [[Pandavas]], rulers of [[Indraprastha]] (modern Delhi), performed the Chhath ritual on the advice of noble sage [[Dhaumya]]. Through her worship of the Sun God, Draupadi was not only able to solve her immediate problems, but also helped the Pandavas later regain their lost kingdom.

Its yogic history dates back to the Vedic times. The [[rishis]] of yore used this method to remain without any external intake of food as they were able to obtain energy directly from the sun's rays. This was done through the Chhath method.&lt;ref&gt;''Sri Chhath Mahaviggyaan'' (The Science of Chhath) by Yogishri Oumkaar&lt;/ref&gt; Another history behind celebrating the Chhath puja is the story of Lord [[Rama]]. It is considered that Lord Rama of Ayodhya and [[Sita]] of [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]] had kept fast and offer puja to the Lord Sun in the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]] in Shukla Paksh during their coronation after returning to the Ayodhya after 14 years of exile.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Chhathi Maiya==
The Goddess who is worshipped during the famous Chhath Puja is known as [[Chhathi Maiya]]. Chhathi Maiya is the manas daughter of brahma and also known as devsena and Shasthi devi in vedas.She is the form of Parvati,Sister of lord Sun and wife of Mahadev.During Chhath she come from kailash in form of Chhathi maiya and Dinanath receives her.In mithilanchal region she is also worshipped as name of "RANABE MAI ".{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

This is the only festival which signifies both the rising and setting sun.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The most unique feature about the Chhath Puja is the main idea behind it which is different from the traditional concept of ''Murti Pujan ''(Idol Worshipping) unlike most of the festivals of the Hindu religion { But Murti Pujan is to worshipping the Cool Air mean not to get deceased from air and water, from may years it was linked with fortune and ethical stories }. Some people simply believe that, '''The sun is necessary for the life of possibly every creature on the earth and this festival is a way to pay tribute to it''' irrespective of caste, creed, gender and social stigmas.

==Rituals and traditions==
The rituals of the festival are rigorous and are observed over a period of four days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161106/jsp/bihar/story_117672.jsp|title=Chhath at the crossroads|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://f//web.archive.org/web/20161106165447/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161106/jsp/bihar/story_117672.jsp|archivedate=6 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include holy bathing, fasting and abstaining from drinking water ([[Vratta]]), standing in water for long periods of time, and offering [[prasad]] (prayer offerings) and [[arghya]] to the setting and rising sun,they did not wear stitched cloth,man wear dhoti and women wear cotton saree without any stitches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/chhath-rituals-bring-family-together/articleshow/61190103.cms|title=Chhath rituals bring family together|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024211139/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/chhath-rituals-bring-family-together/articleshow/61190103.cms|archivedate=24 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some devotees also perform a prostration march as they head for the river banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2016-11-08/sun-worshippers.html|title=Sun worshippers|last=Sah|first=Jitendra|date=8 November 2016|work=[[The Kathmandu Post]]|quote=Some devotees go to river banks to worship the sun by prostrating themselves the entire distance.|access-date=11 November 2016|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111191013/http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2016-11-08/sun-worshippers.html|archivedate=11 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The very first day of chhath starts exactly 4 days from Diwali and last for 4 more days. This day the people who observe fast take bath at a river or pond and prepare lunch (consisting of rice, dal mixed with pumpkin, made in pure ghee).

The second day (5th day from Diwali) is known as kharna or kheer-roti or kheer-puri. In which the kheer( A Indian recipe where rice is prepared with sweetened milk instead of water) and chapati ( called roti in many Indian provinces). The people observe fast for the full day without taking even water and eat this kheer-roti as dinner after offering it to the rising moon and Goddess Ganga. This is the only time when they eat or drink anything from the starting of the day until the last day of chhath.

The third day is the '''main festival day''' (exactly 6th day from Diwali) of chhath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/Muslims-join-in-Chhat-Puja-celebrations/articleshow/49798221.cms|title=Chhat Puja, the biggest festival in Bihar that falls on the sixth day after Diwali.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222073229/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/Muslims-join-in-Chhat-Puja-celebrations/articleshow/49798221.cms|archivedate=22 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The devotees maintain 'nirjal vrat([[vrata]])' ( Fast without even taking a drop of water ) on the third day. It mainly consist of going on river bank and offering 'argha' ( offering of fruits and sweets in winnow ) and surya namaskar to the setting sun followed by the next day (exactly 7th day from Diwali) event of offering argha and surya namaskar to the rising sun on the fourth or last day of chhath. The fast then comes to an end after offering argha to rising sun. In this way, nearly 42 hours of strict penance comes to an end.

The main worshipers, called ''Parvaitin''  pray for the well-being of their family, and for the prosperity of their offsprings. The starting of the chhath is known as "chhath uthana" and stopping is known as "chhath baithana". Once a family member starts performing Chhath Puja, it is their compulsory duty to perform it every year and to pass it on to the following generations. The festival is skipped only if there happens to be a death of a person or birth of a child in the family that year. If the person stops performing the ritual on any particular year, it stops permanently and one cannot resume it again. Hence, once started, it cannot be stopped and once stopped, it cannot be restarted.

The prasad offerings include sweets, [[Kheer]], [[Thekua]], rice laddu(made of rice grit) and fruits (mainly sugarcane, sweet lime and banana) offered in small bamboo soop [[winnow]]s. The food is strictly vegetarian and is cooked without salt, onions or garlic. Emphasis is put on maintaining the purity of the food. It is said that the festival and the rules must be followed strictly as it is said that it brings more adverse effects than the gain that the puja provides if any of the smallest rule is broken. It is the festival in which providing the helping hand of the person doing the puja is also considered as a good omen.&lt;ref name=toi_thekua&gt;{{cite news|title='Rasiao-kheer', 'thekua' make for festive platter|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-01/ludhiana/30345212_1_chhath-puja-ancient-hindu-festival-sun-god|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=1 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the only festival in which the Setting Sun is worshipped.

The '''FIH World Ranking''' is a ranking system for men's and women's national teams in [[field hockey]]. The teams of the member nations of [[International Hockey Federation]] (FIH), field hockey's world governing body, are ranked based on their game results. The rankings were introduced in October 2003.&lt;ref name=introduction&gt;{{cite news|title=FIH to introduce world rankings|url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/09/03/stories/2003090300141900.htm|accessdate=22 December 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=2 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of the rankings ==
The rankings were introduced to overcome the criticism of fixing when drawing the pools for each tournament. It also determines the quotas for tournaments such as the [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and also the [[Hockey World Cup|World Cup]].&lt;ref name=system&gt;{{cite web|title=FIH World Ranking System|url=http://www.fih.ch/files/Sport/World%20Ranking/World%20Ranking%20Explanatory%20note.pdf|work=International Hockey Federation|publisher=FIH.ch|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculation method ==
=== Overview ===
All of the FIH-recognised, including qualifying and continental tournaments for last four years are included in ranking points calculation. However, the past results will be deducted by the percentage set by the FIH as shown by the tabulated below.

{| class=wikitable

=== Continental championships ===
FIH had set the total allocated points for continental tournament. However, a different percentage was set to differ the standard of regional field hockey. Currently, only Europe had full 100% points allocation for all classification while the others had only several finishers with full points allocation. Africa is the sole continent with neither men's or women's tournament had full points allocation.

The '''Ferranti valve''' is a type of [[vacuum tube]] developed by Messers. [[Ferranti]] Ltd., in measuring the [[charge-to-mass ratio]] of an [[electron]]. It consists of an [[anode]] and two co-axial guard rings. A [[cathode]], as a thin wire of [[tungsten]] filament, runs through this arrangement. When heated to a particular temperature using an HT electricity supply, electrons are emitted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13799">The use of '''ionic liquids in carbon capture''' is a potential application of [[ionic liquid]]s as [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]]s for use in [[carbon capture]] and [[Carbon sequestration|sequestration]]. Ionic liquids, which are salts that exist as liquids near room temperature, are polar, nonvolatile materials that have been considered for many applications. The urgency of [[climate change]] has spurred research into their use in energy-related applications such as [[carbon capture and storage]].

== Carbon capture using absorption ==

=== Ionic Liquids as Solvents ===
[[Amine]]s are the most prevalent absorbent in postcombustion carbon capture technology today. In particular, [[monoethanolamine]] (MEA) has been used in industrial scales in [[Amine gas treating|postcombustion carbon capture]], as well as in other CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separations, such as "sweetening" of natural gas.&lt;ref name=Kohl&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Kohl and Richard Nielson|title=Gas Purification|edition=5th|publisher=Gulf Publishing|year=1997|isbn=0-88415-220-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, amines are corrosive, degrade over time, and require large industrial facilities. Ionic liquids on the other hand, have low [[vapor pressure]]s . This property results from their strong Coulombic attractive force. Vapor pressure remains low through the substance's [[thermal decomposition]] point (typically &gt;300&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name = "Bates"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bates|first1=Eleanor D.|last2=Mayton|first2=Rebecca D.|last3=Ntai|first3=Ioanna|last4=Davis|first4=James H.|title=CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture by a Task-Specific Ionic Liquid|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=124|issue=6|year=2002|pages=926–927|issn=0002-7863|doi=10.1021/ja017593d}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In principle, this low vapor pressure simplifies their use and makes them "[[green chemistry|green]]" alternatives. Additionally, it reduces risk of contamination of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas stream and of leakage into the environment.&lt;ref name = "Zhang"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Xiangping|last2=Zhang|first2=Xiaochun|last3=Dong|first3=Haifeng|last4=Zhao|first4=Zhijun|last5=Zhang|first5=Suojiang|last6=Huang|first6=Ying|title=Carbon capture with ionic liquids: overview and progress|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|volume=5|issue=5|year=2012|pages=6668|issn=1754-5692|doi=10.1039/c2ee21152a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solubility of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in ionic liquids is governed primarily by the anion, less so  by the cation.&lt;ref name = "Ramdin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramdin|first1=Mahinder|last2=de Loos|first2=Theo W.|last3=Vlugt|first3=Thijs J.H.|title=State-of-the-Art of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture with Ionic Liquids|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|volume=51|issue=24|year=2012|pages=8149–8177|issn=0888-5885|doi=10.1021/ie3003705}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hexafluorophosphate]] (PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[tetrafluoroborate]] (BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/sup&gt;) anions have been shown to be especially amenable to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture.&lt;ref name = "Ramdin" /&gt;

Ionic liquids have been considered as solvents in a variety of [[liquid-liquid extraction]] processes, but never commercialized.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Ionic Liquids for Better Separation Processes|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-48520-0|issn=2196-6982|last1=Rodríguez|first1=Héctor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside that, ionic liquids have replaced the conventional volatile solvents in industry such as absorption of gases or extractive distillation. Additionally, ionic liquids are used as co-solutes for the generation of aqueous [[Phase (matter)|biphasic]] systems, or purification of biomolecules.

=== Process ===
[[File:AmineTreating.png|thumb|right|A typical [[amine gas treating]] process flow diagram. Ionic liquids for use in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture by absorption could follow a similar process.]]
A typical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorption process consists of a feed gas, an absorption column, a stripper column, and output streams of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-rich gas to be sequestered, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-poor gas to be released to the atmosphere. Ionic liquids could follow a similar process to [[amine gas treating]], where the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is regenerated in the stripper using higher temperature. However, ionic liquids can also be stripped using pressure swings or inert gases, reducing the process energy requirement.&lt;ref name = "Zhang" /&gt; A current issue with ionic liquids for carbon capture is that they have a lower working capacity than amines. Task-specific ionic liquids that employ [[chemisorption]] and [[physisorption]] are being developed in an attempt to increase the working capacity. 1-butyl-3-propylamineimidazolium tetrafluoroborate is one example of a TSIL.&lt;ref name = "Bates" /&gt;

== Drawbacks ==

=== Selectivity ===
In carbon capture an effective [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] is one which demonstrates a high selectivity, meaning that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will preferentially dissolve in the absorbent compared to other gaseous components. In [[Post-combustion capture|post-combustion carbon capture]] the most salient separation is CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas in pre-combustion separation CO is primarily separated from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Other components and impurities may be present in the [[flue gas]], such as hydrocarbons, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. Before selecting the appropriate solvent to use for carbon capture it is critical to ensure that at the given process conditions and flue gas composition CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; maintains a much higher [[solubility]] in the solvent than the other species in the flue gas and thus has a high selectivity.

The selectivity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in ionic liquids has been widely studied by researchers. Generally, [[Chemical polarity|polar molecules]] and molecules with an electric quadrupole moment are highly soluble in liquid ionic substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weingartner|first=H|date=2008|title=Understanding ionic liquids at the molecular level: facts, problems, and controversies|url=|journal=Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.|volume=47|pages=654–670|doi=10.1002/anie.200604951}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that at high process temperatures the solubility of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decreases, while the solubility of other species, such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, may increase with increasing temperature, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the solvent. However, the solubility of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in ionic liquids is relatively low and does not increase with increasing temperature so the use of ionic liquids in post-combustion carbon capture may be appropriate due to the consistently high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|first=J. L.|last2=Maginn|first2=E. J.|last3=Brennecke|first3=J. F.|date=2002|title=Solubilities and thermodynamic properties of gases in the ionic liquid 1-n-butyl-3- methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate.|url=|journal=J. Phys. Chem. B|volume=106|pages=7315–7320|doi=10.1021/jp020631a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of common flue gas impurities such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S severely inhibits CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solubility in ionic liquids and should be carefully considered by engineers when choosing an appropriate solvent for a particular flue gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramdin|first=M.|last2=de Loos|first2=T. W.|last3=Vlugt|first3=T. J. H|date=2012|title=State-of-the-Art of CO2 Capture with Ionic Liquids|url=|journal=Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.|volume=51|pages=8149–8177|doi=10.1021/ie3003705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viscosity ===
A primary concern with the use of ionic liquids for carbon capture is their high [[viscosity]] compared with that of commercial solvents. Ionic liquids which employ [[chemisorption]] depend on a chemical reaction between solute and solvent for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation. The rate of this reaction is dependent on the diffusivity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the solvent and is thus inversely proportional to viscosity. The self diffusivity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in ionic liquids are generally to the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maginn|first=E. J.|date=2009|title=Molecular simulation of ionic liquids: current status and future opportunities|url=|journal=J. Phys.: Condens. Matter|volume=21|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately an order of magnitude less than similarly performing commercial solvents used on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture.  The viscosity of an ionic liquid can vary significantly according to the type of anion and cation, the alkyl chain length, and the amount of water or other impurities in the solvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacquemin|first=J|last2=Husson|first2=P.|last3=Padua|first3=A. A. H.|last4=Majer|first4=V.|date=2006|title=Density and viscosity of several pure and water-saturated ionic liquids|url=|journal=Green Chemistry|volume=8|pages=172–180|doi=10.1039/b513231b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gardas|first=R. L.|last2=Coutinho|first2=J. A. P.|date=2009|title=Group contribution methods for the prediction of thermophysical and transport properties of ionic liquids|url=|journal=AIChE J.|volume=55|pages=1274–1290|doi=10.1002/aic.11737}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because these solvents can be “designed” and these properties chosen, developing ionic liquids with lowered viscosities is a current topic of research. Supported ionic liquid phases (SILPs) are one proposed solution to this problem.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez" /&gt;

== Tunability ==
[[File:1-butyl-3-propylamineimidazolium-tetrafluoroborate-balls.png|300px|thumb|right|1-butyl-3-propylamineimidazolium tetrafluoroborate is a task-specific ionic liquid for use in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation.]]
As required for all separation techniques, ionic liquids exhibit selectivity towards one or more of the phases of a mixture. [[1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate]] (BMIM-PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is a room-temperature ionic liquid that was identified early on as a viable substitute for volatile organic solvents in liquid-liquid separations.&lt;ref name = "Huddleston" /&gt; Other [PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]- and [BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]- containing ionic liquids have been studied for their CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorption properties, as well as 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMIM) and unconventional cations like trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium ([P&lt;sub&gt;66614&lt;/sub&gt;]).&lt;ref name = "Zhang" /&gt; Selection of different anion and cation combinations in ionic liquids affects their selectivity and physical properties. Additionally, the organic cations in ionic liquids can be "tuned" by changing chain lengths or by substituting radicals.&lt;ref name = "Rodriguez" /&gt; Finally, ionic liquids can be mixed with other ionic liquids, water, or amines to achieve different properties in terms of absorption capacity and heat of absorption. This tunability has led some to call ionic liquids "designer solvents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freemantle|first1=Michael|title=Designer Solvents|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|volume=76|issue=13|year=1998|pages=32–37|issn=0009-2347|doi=10.1021/cen-v076n013.p032}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1-butyl-3-propylamineimidazolium tetrafluoroborate was specifically developed for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture; it is designed to employ chemisorption to absorb CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and maintain efficiency under repeated absorption/regeneration cycles.&lt;ref name = "Bates" /&gt; Other ionic liquids have been simulated or experimentally tested for potential use as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorbents.

== Proposed industrial applications ==
Currently, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture uses mostly [[amine]]-based absorption technologies, which are energy intensive and solvent intensive. [[Volatile organic compound]]s alone in chemical processes represent a multibillion-dollar industry.&lt;ref name = "Huddleston"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huddleston|first1=Jonathan G.|last2=Willauer|first2=Heather D.|last3=Swatloski|first3=Richard P.|last4=Visser|first4=Ann E.|last5=Rogers|first5=Robin D.|title=Room temperature ionic liquids as novel media for ‘clean’ liquid–liquid extraction|journal=Chem. Commun.|issue=16|year=1998|pages=1765–1766|issn=1359-7345|doi=10.1039/A803999B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ionic liquids offer an alternative that prove attractive should their other deficiencies be addressed.

During the capture process, the anion and cation play a crucial role in the dissolution of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Spectroscopic results suggest a favorable interaction between the anion and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, wherein CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules preferentially attach to the anion. Furthermore, [[intermolecular force]]s, such as [[hydrogen bond]]s, [[van der Waals bond]]s, and [[Electrostatic force|electrostatic]] attraction, contributes to the solubility of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in ionic liquids. This makes ionic liquids promising candidates for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture because the solubility of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be modeled accurately by the regular solubility theory (RST), which reduces operational costs in developing more sophisticated model to monitor the capture process.

'''Kedr''' ({{lang-ru|кедр}} meaning ''[[Siberian pine]]''; [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s callsign during the [[Vostok 1]] mission) also known as '''ARISSat 1''' and '''RadioSkaf-2''', was&lt;ref name=arissat-sk&gt;{{cite web|title=ArisSat-1 SK|url=http://www.southgatearc.org/news/january2012/arissat1_sk.htm|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  an [[amateur radio]] [[Miniaturized satellite|minisatellite]] operated by [[RKK Energia]] as part of the [[Amateur Radio on the International Space Station]] and [[RadioSkaf]] programmes. A follow-up to the [[SuitSat]] spacecraft, Kedr was launched to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Vostok 1]] mission.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1517">'''Kisarawe''' is a [[Tanzania]]n district that is the larger settlement of the [[Pugu Hills]], southwest of [[Dar es Salaam]]. In the Kisarawe district there is an 8200-[[hectre]]s cultivation of ''[[Jathropa]]'' shrubs that are processed to produce [[biodiesel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/51914/2/Beijing728.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the districts of the Pwani (Coast) region and also one of the earliest districts of Tanzania. It is bordered by Mkuranga District to the east, Dar es Salaam region to the north east, Kibaha district to the north, Rufiji district to the South and Morogoro region to the west.
As of January, 2018 the population of Kisarawe district was 108,398 according to the Kisarawe District council website. The district is divided into seventeen (17) wards. 
Though Kisarawe has not enjoyed the economic prosperity as the neighbouring Dar es Salaam and other surrounding districts, it is strategically located with both TAZARA and Central railway lines passing through the district. It is also  a few kilometres from JK Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam.
The Pugu Forest Reserve, an important nature reserve around the Dar es Salaam area is located in the district. Also Kisarawe is one of the major cultivators of cassava in Tanzania.

'''Leo Charles Ferrari''' (December 8, 1927 – October 7, 2010) was a [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]] [[philosophy]] [[professor]], noted [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] scholar, and founding member of the parody organization [[Flat Earth Society#Canadian society|Flat Earth Society of Canada]].&lt;ref name=fonds-intro /&gt;&lt;ref name=nbl-encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

== Flat Earth Society activities ==
Leo Ferrari was a founding member and head of the satirical [[Flat Earth Society of Canada]], later renamed the Flat Earth Society (FES).&lt;ref name=fonds-3&gt;

    |oclc=153913670
    |pages=15–23}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ferrari's writings in support of the FES and the [[Flat Earth]], he attributed everything from gender to racial inequality on the globularist and the [[Spherical Earth]] model.&lt;ref&gt;http://mje.mcgill.ca/article/download/7006/4948&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferrari even claimed to have nearly fallen off "the Edge" of the Earth at  Brimstone Head on [[Fogo Island, Newfoundland and Labrador|Fogo Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colombo|first=John R|title=Canadian Literary Landmarks|date=1984|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-0888820730|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferrari was a key figure in the 1990 flat earth "documentary", ''In Search of the Edge''.&lt;ref name=dvd /&gt; In the accompanying study guide, Ferrari is outed as a "globularist," someone who believes the earth is spherical.&lt;ref name=dvd-notes /&gt; The intent of the film was to promote critical thinking about media by "[attempting] to prove in convincing fashion, something everyone knew to be false."&lt;ref name=dvd-notes /&gt;

Category&amp;nbsp;4 [[hurricane]]s are [[tropical cyclone]]s that reach Category&amp;nbsp;4 intensity on the [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale]].  Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricanes that later attained Category&amp;nbsp;5 strength are not included in this list. The Atlantic basin includes the open waters of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Category&amp;nbsp;4 is the second-highest hurricane classification category on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, and storms that are of this intensity maintain [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 113&amp;ndash;136&amp;nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]] (130&amp;ndash;156&amp;nbsp;mph, 209&amp;ndash;251&amp;nbsp;km/h). Based on the Atlantic hurricane database, 94&amp;nbsp;hurricanes have attained Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricane status since 1851, the start of modern meteorological record keeping. Category&amp;nbsp;4 storms are considered extreme hurricanes. [[Hurricane Ike]], which was a Category&amp;nbsp;4 storm, brought on a 24&amp;nbsp;ft storm surge, the third greatest [[storm surge]] ever recorded (after [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Camille]], respectively).

==Statistics==
Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricanes have [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 113&amp;ndash;136&amp;nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]] (130&amp;ndash;156&amp;nbsp;mph, 209&amp;ndash;251&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name="disc1"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Saffir-Simpson Scale|publisher=National Weather Service|year=2007|accessdate=2007-11-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshs.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sustained winds" refers to the average [[wind]] speed observed over one minute at a height of 10&amp;nbsp;[[metre|meters]] (33&amp;nbsp;ft) above ground. Gust can be 30% higher than the sustained winds.&lt;ref name="disc2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Landsea|title=FAQ subject D4|year=2006|publisher=HURDAT|accessdate=2007-12-17|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile homes and other buildings without fixed structures can be completely destroyed, and the lower floors of sturdier structures usually sustain major damage. In addition to the winds, the cyclones generally produce a [[storm surge]] of 13–18&amp;nbsp;feet (4–5.5&amp;nbsp;m) above normal, potentially causing major beach erosion. Heavy, irreparable damage and/or near complete destruction of gas station canopies and other wide span overhang type structures are also very common, and mobile and manufactured homes are often completely destroyed. Low-level terrain may be flooded well inland, as well.&lt;ref name="NHC SSHS"&gt;{{cite web | author = [[National Hurricane Center]] | title = Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale Information | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | date = June 22, 2006 | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshs.shtml | accessdate = 2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricanes are very often Cape Verde type hurricanes. Cape Verde hurricanes are usually the strongest, and their track sometimes points them towards the United States, or other land.&lt;ref name="disc3"&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Landsea|title=FAQ subject A2|year=2006|publisher=HURDAT|accessdate=2007-12-17|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes appears to have nearly doubled in occurrence in from 1970 to 2004.&lt;ref name="disc4"&gt;{{cite web|author=NSF|title=severe Hurricanes doubled in the past 35 years|year=2005|publisher=NSF|accessdate=2013-09-03

Due to growing population in major coastal cities, many areas have become more vulnerable to strong hurricanes, especially categories 4 and 5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weather.com/newscenter/specialreports/hurricanes/vulnerablecities/index.html weather.com - Vulnerable Cities: Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222053816/http://www.weather.com/newscenter/specialreports/hurricanes/vulnerablecities/index.html |date=2007-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meteorological measurements==
All of the storms listed in this analysis are listed in chronological order, but they also list the minimum central pressure and maximum sustained winds. Each of these meteorological readings are taken using a specific meteorological instrument. For modern storms, the minimum [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] measurements are taken by [[Hurricane Hunters|Reconnaissance Aircraft]] using [[dropsonde]]s, or by determining it from satellite imagery using the [[Dvorak technique]]. For older storms, pressures are often incomplete, typically being provided by ship-reports or land-observations. None of these methods can provide constant pressure measurements; thus it is possible the only measurement occurred when the cyclone was at a lesser strength.&lt;ref name="disc7"&gt;{{cite web|author=Terry Hock |title=GPS dropsondes |year=2007 |publisher=NCAR |accessdate=2007-12-16 |url=http://www.eol.ucar.edu/rtf/facilities/dropsonde/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607165932/http://www.eol.ucar.edu/rtf/facilities/dropsonde/ |archivedate=June 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustained winds are taken using an [[Anemometer]] at 10&amp;nbsp;meters (33&amp;nbsp;ft) above the ground.&lt;ref name="FEMA glossary"&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] | title = Hurricane Glossary of Terms | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2006-03-24 | url = http://www.fema.gov/hazards/hurricanes/hurglos.shtm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051214034332/http://www.fema.gov/hazards/hurricanes/hurglos.shtm |archivedate = 2005-12-14}} Accessed through the [[Internet Archive|Wayback Machine]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climatology==
A total of 95&amp;nbsp;hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean Basin, including the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean]], have reached Category&amp;nbsp;4 status as their peak intensity. (Note that Category&amp;nbsp;4 storms that intensified later to [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale#Category 5|Category 5]] status are not included in this analysis.)
 
Most Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricanes occur during September, with 51&amp;nbsp;storms occurring in that month. This coincides with the average peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which occurs on September 10.&lt;ref name="NHC Atl peak"&gt;{{cite web | author = [[National Hurricane Center]] | title = Tropical Cyclone Climatology | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastprofile.shtml | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | date = 2007-03-08 | accessdate = 2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricanes develop in the warm waters of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Several Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricanes are [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]]s. 
There have been no Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricanes to form in either May or December, or in any other month outside the traditional bounds of the Atlantic hurricane season.

==List of Category 4 hurricanes==

===Listed in chronological order===
All data listed is provided by the NHC best track, unless otherwise noted.  
Also, some pressure readings for the older storms may have been taken at a time other than the storm's peak intensity. Thus, some pressure readings might not be the minimum pressure.

Some pressure readings are unavailable due to scarce information.

==Landfalls==
The following hurricanes made [[landfall]] at some location at any strength. Due to inaccuracies in data, tropical depression landfalls are not included. Several of these storms weakened slightly after attaining Category 4 status as they approached land; this is usually a result of dry air, shallower water due to shelving, cooler waters, or interaction with land.

In 1974, Wales was divided into 8 counties, with 37 [[Districts of Wales|districts]]. The NCC created 12 Welsh Areas of Search; they mostly follow county borders, but the larger counties ([[Dyfed]], [[Powys]] and [[Gwynedd]]) were divided into multiple Areas using district borders. [[Mid Glamorgan|Mid]] and [[South Glamorgan]] were merged into a single AOS, whilst [[Llanelli (district)|Llanelli district]] was included in the [[West Glamorgan]] AOS.

Due to subsequent local government reorganisation in the UK since 1972, many counties and districts have been divided, merged or renamed. Using the AOS system alone would make it difficult to search for individual SSSI citations via the [[Countryside Council for Wales]] (CCW) database without knowing 1972 region divisions. As a result, the CCW groups Welsh SSSIs using the [[Local government in Wales|subdivisions of Wales]] formed in April 1996 by the [[Local Government (Wales) Act 1994]], resulting in 22 [[Principal areas#Wales|principal areas]].

Clwyd AOS lies within the counties of [[Conwy County Borough|Conwy]], [[Denbighshire]], [[Flintshire]], and [[Wrexham County Borough|Wrexham]].

For SSSIs elsewhere in the UK, see [[List of SSSIs by Area of Search]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="86124">The information regarding '''[[Fjords and channels of Chile|fjords, channels, sound and straits of Chile]]''' on this page is compiled from the data supplied by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120709181017/http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/namefiles.htm Country Files (GNS)].&lt;ref name="nga"&gt;The NGA country data of Chile data was retrieved on 19 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
This list contains only:
# '''Listnr''' - List number (Wikipedia intern)
# '''Full name - reversed generic'''. The full name is the complete name that identifies a named feature. The full name is output in reversed generic, "Desertores, Canal" as stored in the database, as opposed to the reading order, "Canal Desertores".
# '''Latitude''' of the feature in ± decimal degrees
# '''Longitude''' of the feature in  ± decimal degrees
# Unique Feature Identifier ('''UFI''') is a number which uniquely identifies a Geoname feature. Same UFI means same feature.
# '''FDC''' is the Feature Designation Code
# '''Other names''' listed by NGA for the same feature

This list doesn't include Chilean claims in the [[Antarctica]].

NGA lists 1447 names for 838 features with generics like "Fiordo", "Seno", "Canal", "Paso", "Bahía", "Brazo", "Estrecho", "Ensenada", "Estero". This compilation moved repeated UFIs to the last column of the first name given by NGA.

NGA gives following definition of the features in [http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/feature_designation_code_help.html Feature Designation Code]:
:'''CHNM''', marine channel, that part of a body of water deep enough for navigation through an area otherwise not suitable
:'''CHNN''', navigation channel, a buoyed channel of sufficient depth for the safe navigation of vessels

Various '''fossil primates''' have been found in '''South America''' and adjacent regions such as Panama and the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=Tejedor2013_p22&gt;Tejedor et al., 2013, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Presently, 78 species of [[New World monkey]]s have been registered in South America.&lt;ref name=Rosenberger2001_p2&gt;Rosenberger &amp; Hartwig, 2001, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Around the middle of the Cenozoic, approximately 34 million years ago,&lt;ref name=Lynch2015_p519&gt;Lynch Alfaro et al., 2015, p.519&lt;/ref&gt; two types of mammals appeared for the first time in South America: [[rodent]]s and [[primate]]s. Both of these groups had already been inhabiting other continents for millions of years and they simply arrived in [[South America]] rather than originated there. Analyses of evolutionary relationships have shown that their closest relatives were living in [[Africa]] at the time. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that they somehow crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean]], which was less wide than today, landed in South America, and founded new populations of rodents and primates.&lt;ref name=Croft&gt;[https://dcpaleo.org/south-american-fossil-mammals/ South American Fossil Mammals]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first South American primates gave rise to an impressive evolutionary radiation: more than 120 species in five families. These primates are known as [[platyrrhini|platyrrhine]] (flat-nosed) primates and are closely related to Old World apes and monkeys ([[catarrhini|catarrhine primates]]). Platyrrhines include some of the most popular and acrobatic monkeys such as [[spider monkey]]s (''[[Ateles]]'') and capuchins (''[[Cebus]]''), both of which have grasping (prehensile) tails that can be used as a fifth limb. Platyrrhines also include a wide variety of colorful [[tamarin]]s and [[marmoset]]s (family [[Callitrichidae]]). The platyrrhine primate fossil record is relatively sparse, quite unlike that of caviomorph rodents.&lt;ref name=Croft/&gt;

The presently oldest New World monkey is ''[[Perupithecus|Perupithecus ucayaliensis]]'' from Amazonian Peru, described in 2015.&lt;ref name=Bond2015_p538&gt;Bond et al., 2015, p.538&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study of the fossils estimated the body mass for the various fossil primate species.&lt;ref name=Silvestro2017_p14&gt;Silvestro et al., 2017, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of fossil primates of South America ==
''Note:'' some authors, among others [[Fossilworks]], consider ''[[Killikaike]]'' synonymous with ''[[Homunculus (monkey)|Homunculus]]'' and ''[[Szalatavus]]'' with ''[[Branisella]]'', while other researchers consider the genera as different.&lt;br&gt;The Panamanian and Caribbean fossil primates have been included for completeness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3459">The '''Master of Resource Management''' ('''MRM''') degree is a [[graduate degree]] program in the [[School of Resource and Environmental Management]]  at [[Simon Fraser University]] in [[Burnaby, British Columbia]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rem.sfu.ca/programs/mrm/ |title=Master's in Resource and Environmental Management |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the university centre of the Westfjords, Iceland. This program is designed for both recent graduates and individuals with experience in the private or public sector in dealing with [[natural resource]]s and the [[Environmental quality|environment]]. The program seeks students from a range of disciplines including [[biology]], [[engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[forestry]], [[geology]], [[business]], [[economics]], [[geography]], planning and [[social sciences]]. The program is recognized as an accredited [[sustainable planning]] program by the [[Canadian Institute of Planners]] and the [[Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.cip-icu.ca/web/la/en/pa/5580378D83DC444EB76DE6A461BB2E21/template.asp|title=The Canadian Institute of Planners|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=

== Degree requirements ==
The M.R.M. degree requires completion of six required courses (social science in [[natural resource management]], [[ecology]], [[ecological economics]], [[earth systems]], research methods), six elective courses, a [[field workshop]], and a [[research project]].

The aim is to increase familiarity and competence in understanding the dynamics of natural resources, the strategies and techniques of natural resource and [[environmental planning]] and management, and the biological, physical, social, economic and institutional implications of resource decisions. Students also become familiar with various quantitative methods of analysis and aids to [[decision making]]. In the field of natural resources, in particular, it is important that an academic degree provide a foundation for problem-solving as well as creative and critical thinking rather than focus primarily on subject matter such as [[fisheries]], economics, or forestry.

Graduate student research projects required to complete the degree evaluate the effectiveness of existing natural resource management policies and, where appropriate, present alternatives. Students apply a range of approaches including [[cost-benefit analysis]], [[simulation modeling]], legal and institutional assessment frameworks, and social surveys to address critical and emerging natural resource management issues on local, national, and international scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rem.sfu.ca/research/publications/|title=REM Publications|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metallic hydrogen''' is a [[phase (matter)|phase]] of [[hydrogen]] in which it behaves like an [[electrical conductor]]. This phase was predicted in 1935 on theoretical grounds by [[Eugene Wigner]] and [[Hillard Bell Huntington]].&lt;ref name=Wigner1935&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wigner |first1=E. |last2=Huntington |first2=H. B. |year=1935 |title=On the possibility of a metallic modification of hydrogen |journal=[[Journal of Chemical Physics]] |volume=3 |issue=12 |page=764 |bibcode=1935JChPh...3..764W |doi=10.1063/1.1749590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[high pressure]] and temperatures, metallic hydrogen can exist as a [[liquid]] rather than a [[solid]], and researchers think it is present in large quantities in the hot and [[gravitationally compressed]] interiors of [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], and in some [[exoplanet]]s.&lt;ref name="guillot04"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Guillot |first1=T. |last2=Stevenson |first2=D. J. |last3=Hubbard |first3=W. B. |last4=Saumon |first4=D. |date=2004 |chapter=Chapter 3: The Interior of Jupiter |editor1-last=Bagenal |editor1-first=F. |editor2-last=Dowling |editor2-first=T. E. |editor3-last=McKinnon |editor3-first=W. B |title=Jupiter: The Planet, Satellites and Magnetosphere |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-81808-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical predictions==
[[File:Jupiter diagram.svg|thumb|450px|A diagram of [[Jupiter]] showing a model of the planet's interior, with a rocky [[planetary core|core]] overlaid by a deep layer of liquid metallic hydrogen and an outer layer predominantly of [[molecular hydrogen]]. Jupiter's true interior composition is uncertain. For instance, the core may have shrunk as convection currents of hot liquid metallic hydrogen mixed with the molten core and carried its contents to higher levels in the planetary interior. Furthermore, there is no clear physical boundary between the hydrogen layers—with increasing depth the gas increases smoothly in temperature and density, ultimately becoming liquid. Features are shown to scale except for the aurorae and the orbits of the [[Galilean moons]].]]

===Metallization of hydrogen under pressure===
Though often placed at the top of the [[alkali metal]] column in the [[periodic table]], hydrogen does not, under ordinary conditions, exhibit the properties of an alkali metal. Instead, it forms diatomic {{chem2|H2}} molecules, analogous to [[halogens]] and non-metals in the second row of the periodic table, such as [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. Diatomic hydrogen is a gas that, at atmospheric pressure, liquefies and solidifies only at very low temperature (20 degrees and 14 degrees above [[absolute zero]], respectively). [[Eugene Wigner]] and [[Hillard Bell Huntington]] predicted that under an immense [[pressure]] of around {{convert|25|GPa|atm psi|abbr=on}} hydrogen would display [[metal]]lic properties: instead of discrete {{chem2|H2}} molecules (which consist of two electrons bound between two protons), a bulk phase would form with a solid lattice of protons and the electrons delocalized throughout.&lt;ref name=Wigner1935/&gt; Since then, producing metallic hydrogen in the laboratory has been described as "...the holy grail of high-pressure physics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |date=6 May 1998 |title=High-pressure scientists 'journey' to the center of the Earth, but can't find elusive metallic hydrogen |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/05/980512080541.htm |publisher=[[ScienceDaily]] |accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial prediction about the amount of pressure needed was eventually shown to be too low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Loubeyre |first1=P. |display-authors=etal |year=1996 |title=X-ray diffraction and equation of state of hydrogen at megabar pressures |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=383 |issue=6602 |pages=702–704 |bibcode=1996Natur.383..702L |doi=10.1038/383702a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first work by Wigner and Huntington, the more modern theoretical calculations point towards higher but nonetheless potentially accessible metallization pressures of around {{convert|400|GPa|atm psi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Azadi |first1=S. |last2=Monserrat |first2=B. |last3=Foulkes |first3=W.M.C. |last4=Needs |first4=R.J. |year=2014 |title=Dissociation of High-Pressure Solid Molecular Hydrogen: A Quantum Monte Carlo and Anharmonic Vibrational Study |journal=[[Physical Review Letters|Phys.

===Liquid metallic hydrogen===
[[Helium-4]] is a [[liquid helium|liquid]] at [[standard pressure|normal pressure]] near [[absolute zero]], a consequence of its high [[zero-point energy]] (ZPE). The ZPE of protons in a dense state is also high, and a decline in the ordering energy (relative to the ZPE) is expected at high pressures. Arguments have been advanced by [[Neil Ashcroft]] and others that there is a melting point maximum in [[compressed hydrogen]], but also that there might be a range of densities, at pressures around 400 GPa, where hydrogen would be a liquid metal, even at low temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ashcroft |first1=N. W. |year=2000 |title=The hydrogen liquids |journal=[[Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter]] |volume=12 |issue=8A |pages=129 |bibcode=2000JPCM...12..129A |doi=10.1088/0953-8984/12/8A/314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bonev |first1=S. A. |display-authors=etal |year=2004 |title=A quantum fluid of metallic hydrogen suggested by first-principles calculations |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=431 |issue=7009 |pages=669–672 |arxiv=cond-mat/0410425 |bibcode=2004Natur.431..669B |doi=10.1038/nature02968 |pmid=15470423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geng predicted that the ZPE of protons indeed lowers the melting temperature of hydrogen to a minimum of {{convert|200|-|250|K|C}} at pressures of {{convert|500|-|1500|GPa|atm psi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Geng |first1=H. Y. |display-authors=etal |year=2015 |title=Lattice stability and high-pressure melting mechanism of dense hydrogen up to 1.5 TPa |journal=[[Physical Review B]] |volume=92 |pages=104103 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.92.104103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Geng |first1=H. Y. |display-authors=etal |year=2016 |title=Predicted reentrant melting of dense hydrogen at ultra-high pressures |journal=[[Scientific Reports]] |volume=6 |pages=36745 |doi=10.1038/srep36745}}&lt;/ref&gt; within this flat region there might have an elemental [[mesophase]] intermediate between the liquid and solid state, which could metastably be stabilized down to low temperature and enter a [[supersolid]] state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Geng |first1=H. Y. |display-authors=etal |year=2017 |title=Prediction of a mobile solid state in dense hydrogen under high pressures |journal=[[J. Phys. Chem. Lett.]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=223–228 |doi=10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b02453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superconductivity===
{{Main|Superconductivity}}
{{further|Room temperature superconductor}}
In 1968, [[Neil Ashcroft]] suggested that metallic hydrogen might be a [[superconductivity|superconductor]], up to [[room temperature]] ({{convert|290|K|C|abbr=on|disp=or}}), far higher than any other known candidate material. This hypothesis is based on an expected strong [[Coupling (physics)|coupling]] between conduction electrons and [[lattice vibration]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ashcroft |first1=N. W. |year=1968 |title=Metallic Hydrogen: A High-Temperature Superconductor? |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=21 |issue=26 |pages=1748–1749 |bibcode=1968PhRvL..21.1748A |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.21.1748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility of novel types of quantum fluid===
Presently known "super" states of matter are [[superconductor]]s, [[superfluid]] liquids and gases, and [[supersolid]]s. [[Egor Babaev]] predicted that if hydrogen and [[deuterium]] have liquid metallic states, they might have quantum ordered states that cannot be classified as superconducting or superfluid in the usual sense. Instead, they might represent two possible novel types of quantum fluids: ''superconducting superfluids'' and ''metallic superfluids''. Such fluids were predicted to have highly unusual reactions to external magnetic fields and rotations, which might provide a means for experimental verification of Babaev's predictions. It has also been suggested that, under the influence of a magnetic field, hydrogen might exhibit [[phase transition]]s from superconductivity to superfluidity and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Babaev |first1=E. |last2=Ashcroft |first2=N. W. |year=2007 |title=Violation of the London law and Onsager–Feynman quantization in multicomponent superconductors |journal=[[Nature Physics]] |volume=3 |issue=8 |pages=530–533 |arxiv=0706.2411 |bibcode=2007NatPh...3..530B |doi=10.1038/nphys646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Babaev |first1=E. |last2=Sudbø |first2=A. |last3=Ashcroft |first3=N.

===Lithium alloying reduces requisite pressure===
In 2009, Zurek ''et al.'' predicted that the [[alloy]] {{chem2|LiH6}} would be a stable metal at only one quarter of the pressure required to metallize hydrogen, and that similar effects should hold for alloys of type LiH&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and possibly "other [[Polyhydride|alkali high-hydride systems]]", i.e. alloys of type XH&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; where X is an [[alkali metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zurek |first1=E. |display-authors=etal |year=2009 |title=A little bit of lithium does a lot for hydrogen |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=106 |issue=42 |pages=17640–3 |bibcode=2009PNAS..10617640Z |doi=10.1073/pnas.0908262106 |doi-access=free |pmc=2764941 |pmid=19805046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental pursuit==
===Shock-wave compression, 1996===
In March 1996, a group of scientists at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] reported that they had [[serendipity|serendipitously]] produced the first identifiably metallic hydrogen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weir |first1=S. T. |last2=Mitchell |first2=A. C. |last3=Nellis |first3=W. J. |year=1996 |title=Metallization of fluid molecular hydrogen at 140&amp;nbsp;GPa (1.4&amp;nbsp;Mbar) |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=76 |issue=11 |pages=1860–1863 |bibcode=1996PhRvL..76.1860W |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.1860 |quote=0.28–0.36&amp;nbsp;mol/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and 2200–4400&amp;nbsp;K}}&lt;/ref&gt; for about a [[microsecond]] at [[temperature]]s of thousands of [[kelvin]]s, pressures of over {{convert|1000000|atm|GPa atm psi|order=out|abbr=on}}, and densities of approximately {{val|0.6|u=g/cm3}}.&lt;ref name="Nellis"&gt;{{cite web |last=Nellis |first=W. J. |year=2001 |title=Metastable Metallic Hydrogen Glass |url=https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/244531.pdf |work=Lawrence Livermore Preprint UCRL-JC-142360 |osti=15005772 |osti-access=free |quote=minimum electrical conductivity of a metal at 140&amp;nbsp;GPa, 0.6&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and 3000&amp;nbsp;K}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team did not expect to produce metallic hydrogen, as it was not using [[solid hydrogen]], thought to be necessary, and was working at temperatures above those specified by metallization theory. Previous studies in which solid hydrogen was compressed inside [[diamond anvil]]s to pressures of up to {{convert|2500000|atm|GPa atm psi|order=out|abbr=on}}, did not confirm detectable metallization. The team had sought simply to measure the less extreme [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]] changes they expected. The researchers used a [[1960 in science|1960s-era]] [[light-gas gun]], originally employed in [[guided missile]] studies, to shoot an impactor plate into a sealed container containing a half-millimeter thick sample of [[liquid hydrogen]]. The liquid hydrogen was in contact with wires leading to a device measuring electrical resistance. The scientists found that, as pressure rose to {{convert|1400000|atm|GPa atm psi|order=out|abbr=on}}, the electronic energy [[band gap]], a measure of [[electrical resistance]], fell to almost zero. The band-gap of hydrogen in its uncompressed state is about {{val|15|ul=eV}}, making it an [[electrical insulator|insulator]] but, as the pressure increases significantly, the band-gap gradually fell to {{val|0.3|u=eV}}. Because the [[thermal energy]] of the fluid (the temperature became about {{convert|3000|K|C|disp=or|abbr=on}} due to compression of the sample) was above {{val|0.3|u=eV}}, the hydrogen might be considered metallic.

===Other experimental research, 1996–2004===
Many experiments are continuing in the production of metallic hydrogen in laboratory conditions at static compression and low temperature. Arthur Ruoff and Chandrabhas Narayana from [[Cornell University]] in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruoff |first1=A. L. |display-authors=etal |year=1998 |title=Solid hydrogen at 342&amp;nbsp;GPa: No evidence for an alkali metal |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=393 |issue=6680 |pages=46–49 |bibcode=1998Natur.393...46N |doi=10.1038/29949}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later Paul Loubeyre and René LeToullec from [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique]], [[France]] in 2002, have shown that at pressures close to those at the [[planetary core|center of the Earth]] ({{convert|3200000|-|3400000|atm|GPa|order=flip|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and temperatures of {{convert|100|-|300|K|C|abbr=on}}, hydrogen is still not a true alkali metal, because of the non-zero band gap. The quest to see metallic hydrogen in laboratory at low temperature and static compression continues. Studies are also ongoing on [[deuterium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baer |first1=B.J. |last2=Evans |first2=W.J. |last3=Yoo |first3=C.-S. |year=2007 |title=Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy of highly compressed solid deuterium at 300&amp;nbsp;K: Evidence for a new phase and implications for the band gap |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=98 |issue=23 |page=235503 |bibcode=2007PhRvL..98w5503B |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.235503}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shahriar Badiei and Leif Holmlid from the [[University of Gothenburg]] have shown in 2004 that condensed metallic states made of excited hydrogen atoms ([[Rydberg matter]]) are effective promoters to metallic hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Badiei |first1=S. |last2=Holmlid |first2=L. |year=2004 |title=Experimental observation of an atomic hydrogen material with H–H bond distance of 150&amp;nbsp;pm suggesting metallic hydrogen |journal=[[Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter]] |volume=16 |issue=39 |pages=7017–7023 |bibcode=2004JPCM...16.7017B |doi=10.1088/0953-8984/16/39/034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pulsed laser heating experiment, 2008===
The theoretically predicted maximum of the melting curve (the prerequisite for the liquid metallic hydrogen) was discovered by Shanti Deemyad and Isaac F. Silvera by using pulsed laser heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deemyad |first=S. |last2=Silvera |first2=I.

In the preprint version of the paper, Dias and Silvera write:

[[Image:Nankai Trough location map.jpg|thumb|400px|Location of the Nankai Trough]]

The '''Nankai Trough''' {{nihongo|南海トラフ|Nankai Torafu|Southern Sea Trough}} is a submarine [[Trough (geology)|trough]] located south of the [[Nankaidō]] region of [[Japan]]'s island of [[Honshū]], extending approximately 900&amp;nbsp;km offshore. The underlying [[Fault (geology)|fault]], the ''Nankai megathrust,'' is the source of the devastating [[Nankai megathrust earthquakes]], while the trough itself is potentially a major source of [[hydrocarbon]] [[fuel]], in the form of [[methane clathrate]].

In [[plate tectonics]], the Nankai Trough marks a [[subduction zone]] that is caused by subduction of the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] beneath Japan, part of the [[Eurasian plate]] (Kanda et al., 2004). This plate boundary would be an [[oceanic trench]] except for a high flux of sediments that fills the trench. Within the Nankai Trough there is a large amount of deformed trench sediments (Ike, 2004), making one of Earth's best examples of [[accretionary prism]].  Furthermore, seismic reflection studies have revealed the presence of basement highs that are interpreted as seamounts that are covered in sediments (Ike, 2004). The northern part of the trough is known as the [[Suruga Trough]], while to the east is the [[Sagami Trough]]. The Nankai trough runs roughly parallel to the [[Japan Median Tectonic Line]].

==Rates of tectonic motion==
[[File:Map00148 (28286522445).jpg|thumb|Undersea geographic features of the western Pacific]]
Conventional geologic estimates of plate movement velocities are difficult in the Nankai Trough because there are no spreading ridges that bound the [[tectonic plate]]. This area was not in the original NUVEL models (DeMets et al., 1990). However, a more recent study that included the Philippine Sea plate was based on data from the NUVEL-1A model (Zang et al., 2002). This study estimates that subduction in the Nankai Trough is about 43&amp;nbsp;mm/yr. REVEL-based calculations indicate that there is no accumulation of strain at the trench. The rates of movement have been calculated to be in a range of 3.0 ± 1.8&amp;nbsp;mm/yr to 11.1 ± 1.7&amp;nbsp;mm/yr (Sella et al., 2002). As mentioned previously, the NUVEL-1A plate motion model does not include the Philippine Sea plate. This is because the mathematics of this model only used twelve plates, and the Philippine Sea and [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] convergent margin were not included. However, using the Eurasia to North America plate motion, the estimated rate was 2–4&amp;nbsp;mm/yr (DeMets et al., 1990). This is not in agreement with the REVEL model, seemingly indicating that the NUVEL-1A model may need further revision.

==Sedimentology==
The deposits are primarily [[trench]]-wedge [[turbidite]]s (Spinelli et al., 2007). There are indications of an increase in the retention of porosity within the rock. Typically porosity reduces with increasing depth. However, there is an anomalous preservation of porosity at depth at drill site 1173. This has been attributed to post-depositional opal cementation that is preserving the porosity (Spinelli et al., 2007).
The detrital clays, primarily [[smectite]], display variation over time and location in the Nankai Trough as well as the Shikoku basin. At depth there is an increase in the smectite clay content in the sediments, inferring that there has been a change in the deposition source rock (Steurer et al., 2003). Furthermore, there is a geothermal alteration of the smectite, converting it to illite clay (Steurer et al., 2003).

==Tectonic structure==
The Nankai Trough is actively deforming and marks a region of seismic activity. Deformation is concentrated in the outermost imbricate zone, with a significant amount of "out of sequence" thrusting occurring landward. Based on the work of Operto et al., 2006, several areas of intense tectonic activity in the Nankai Trough were identified using full waveform tomography. The upper portion of the upper accretionary prism and the underlying backstop are currently undergoing a great deal of compressional pressure. Several thrust faults were identified by Operto et al., 2006, of which the thrust faults closest to the subduction zone are active. Furthermore, Pisani et al., 2006, identified protothrusts and [[decollement]] surfaces along the Nankai Trough. Recently there has been an increase in interest in the release of water from illite clays in subducting sediments. The conversion of smectite to illite (illitizatation) in subduction zones is likely driven by the higher temperature found in the subduction zone as opposed to non-subducting sediments (Saffer et al., 2005). [[International Ocean Discovery Program|IODP]] Expedition 370 will seek to find the temperature limit of the deepest life on Earth by drilling in the Nankai Trough, where heat flow is particularly high near its boundary with the subducting young, hot Philippine Sea tectonic plate. At the targeted site, the geothermal gradient is about four times steeper than elsewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Reaching temperatures of approximately 130&amp;nbsp;°C in other areas would require collecting cores from approximately 4 kilometers below the seafloor, rather than 1.2 kilometers as planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deepcarbon.net/feature/how-hot-is-too-hot#.V9Fp-4WASfE|title=T-Limit of the Deep Biosphere off Muroto|website=www.deepcarbon.net|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seismicity==
[[Image:EQ cluster.jpg|thumb|450px|Depth of earthquake foci in cross section, modified from Obana, et al., 2002]]

The Nankai Trough is the near-surface extension of a zone of active seismicity that dips beneath SW Japan. The rupture zone has been subdivided into five areas with respect to seismic modelling (Mitsui et al., 2004). These five subdivisions show interesting differences in [[earthquake]] behavior: frequency of earthquakes varying on a 90 to 150-year cycle (Mitsui, et al., 2004; Tanioka et al., 2004), similar slip occurrences along the fault segments, the order of subdivision faulting, and finally, different failure features. Hydrologic observatories were placed in boreholes drilled in 2000 ([[Integrated Ocean Drilling Program|IODP]] sites 808 and 1173) in an attempt to quantify changes in pore-fluid pressure that are a result of the oncoming Philippine Sea plate (Davis et al., 2006). Site 808 is located in the front section of the main thrust fault, while site 1173 is located approximately 11&amp;nbsp;km from the frontal thrust zone (Hitoshi et al., 2006). Other interesting results of the pressure measurements were the pressure changes that resulted from sediment deformation near boreholes and the effect of very low earthquake swarms at the time of pressure changes (Davis et al., 2006). The working hypothesis is that pressure changes indicate a change in the elastic strain within the formation (Davis et al., 2006).

A seaward change in the pressure as measured by the borehole instruments likely indicates a relaxation of the sediments from the previous major thrust earthquake. Furthermore, the short period [[seismicity]] appears to have some degree of dependency on [[bathymetric]] highs such as seamounts. This was concluded by Kanda et al., 2004, through inversion analysis of [[seismic]] data.
Historically, the most recent large-scale earthquake to occur in the Nankai Trough was in 1944 off the [[Kii Peninsula]]. Using recent ocean bottom seismograph studies, it has been determined that most of the seismicity occurs near the trough axis (Obana et al., 2006). Along the western area of the Nankai Trough, seismicity appears to be related to irregularities in crustal structure such as fractures generated from the subducted seafloor, including backarc basin crust of the [[Shikoku Basin]], as well as due to serpentization of uppermost mantle beneath the overriding plate (Obana et al., 2006). Recent large scale earthquakes resulting from subduction along the Nankai Trough have occurred in areas of large scale increases in the dip angle of the subducting plate (Hori et al., 2004).

==Petroleum significance==
[[Image:SubductionHydratedist.jpg|thumb|600px|Distribution of identified gas hydrate locations, in green and the location of selected subduction zones, red lines, modefied from Collet, 2002.]]

The trough is potentially a major source of [[hydrocarbon]] [[fuel]], in the form of [[methane clathrate]]. However, {{as of|2014|lc=yes}} there is no commercial exploitation.

At depth in the ocean bottoms, in some cases water can form an ice-like solid structure that has methane trapped in its crystalline lattice, forming [[gas hydrates]]. The source of water for the formation of gas hydrates frequently comes from the dewatering of a subducting slab as well as the overriding plate (Muramatsu et al., 2006). Gas hydrates nearest the trough appear to be sourced mainly from dewatering associated with subduction, while with increasing distance from the trough the sourcing is more a result of lateral movement of methane enriched waters (Muramatsu et al., 2006). This was determined by drilling a series of boreholes and measuring the concentration, as well as radiometric age determination of the halogen elements iodine, bromine, and chlorine (Tomaru et al., 2007). The age determination of the iodine indicated multiple methane sources.

It has been estimated that convergent margins may contain up to two-thirds of the total gas hydrate volume on the earth (Kastner, 2001). The Nankai Trough has been described as containing a large amount of gas hydrates and is one of the best studied sites of gas hydrate formations (Collett, 2002; Saito et al., 2007). The information concerning the gas hydrates in the Nankai Trough was initially published in 2000 by the Japan National Oil Corporations. The data in the news release came from a series of boreholes what were started in the late 1990s. In this area the main sedimentological controls for the accumulation of gas hydrates are the sand-rich areas of the trough (Collett, 2002). Well coring indicates the presence of at least three gas hydrate zones. Krason, 1994, estimated that there are 0.42 to 4.2×10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; cubic meters of methane within the gas hydrates. Seismically, the high bottom simulating reflectors are considered indicative of gas hydrates (Colwell et al., 2004). Methane-rich horizons have been identified as areas of higher attenuation of sonic frequencies (10 to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz) and only slight attenuation of seismic frequencies (30 to 110&amp;nbsp;Hz) (Matsushima, 2006).

In [[ancient Greek religion]], '''Nemesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɛ|m|ə|s|ɪ|s}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Νέμεσις), also called '''Rhamnousia''' or '''Rhamnusia''' ("the [[goddess]] of [[Rhamnous]]"), is the goddess who enacts [[divine retribution|retribution]] against those who succumb to [[hubris]] (arrogance before the gods). Another name is '''Adrasteia''' or '''[[Adrestia]]''', meaning "the inescapable".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus 14.11.25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''Nemesis'' is related to the [[Greek language|Greek]] word νέμειν ''némein'', meaning "to give what is due",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=nemesis|title=Nemesis&amp;nbsp;— Origin and history of nemesis by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''nem-'' "distribute".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, pp. 1005–6.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gheorghe Tattarescu - Nemesis, zeita razbunarii.jpg|left|thumb|''Nemesis'', by [[Gheorghe Tattarescu]]&lt;nowiki&gt; (1853)&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]

==Origin==
Divine retribution is a major theme in the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenic]] world view, providing the unifying theme of the [[Greek tragedy|tragedies]] of [[Sophocles]] and many other literary works.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://swanson.bol.ucla.edu/| title = The Nemesis Theory | publisher = University of California | date = | accessdate = October 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://literarydevices.net/nemesis/| title = Examples of Nemesis in Literature | publisher =  | date = | accessdate = October 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hesiod]] states: "Also deadly [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] bore Nemesis an affliction to mortals subject to death" (''[[Theogony]]'', 223, though perhaps an interpolated line). Nemesis appears in a still more concrete form in a fragment of the epic ''[[Cypria]]''.

She is implacable justice: that of [[Zeus]] in the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] scheme of things, although it is clear she existed prior to him, as her images look similar to several other goddesses, such as [[Cybele]], [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], [[Demeter]], and [[Artemis]].&lt;ref&gt;The primeval concept of Nemesis is traced by Marcel Mauss (Mauss, ''The Gift: the form and reason for exchange in archaic societies'', 2002:23: "Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis avenges the poor... This is the ancient morality of the gift, which has become a principle of justice". Jean Coman, in discussing Nemesis in [[Aeschylus]] (Coman, ''L'idée de la Némésis chez Eschyle'', Strasbourg, 1931:40-43) detected "traces of a less rational, and probably older, concept of deity and its relationship to man", as Michael B. Hornum observed in ''Nemesis, the Roman State and the Games'', 1993:9.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the "Goddess of Rhamnous", Nemesis was honoured and placated in an archaic sanctuary in the isolated district of Rhamnous, in northeastern [[Attica]]. There she was a daughter of [[Oceanus]], the primaeval river-ocean that encircles the world. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] noted her iconic statue there. It included a crown of stags and little [[Nike (mythology)|Nikes]] and was made by [[Pheidias]] after the [[Battle of Marathon]] (490 BC), crafted from a block of [[Paros|Parian]] [[marble]] brought by the overconfident Persians, who had intended to make a memorial [[stele]] after their expected victory.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'', 1.33.2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Her cult may have originated at [[Smyrna]].

She is portrayed as a winged goddess wielding a whip or a dagger.

The poet [[Mesomedes]] wrote a hymn to Nemesis in the early second century AD, where he addressed her:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nemesis, winged balancer of life, dark-faced goddess, daughter of Justice&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and mentioned her "adamantine bridles" that restrain "the frivolous insolences of mortals".

In early times the representations of Nemesis resembled Aphrodite, who sometimes bears the epithet Nemesis.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

Later, as the maiden goddess of proportion and the [[Retributive justice|avenger of crime]], she has as attributes a [[measuring rod]] ([[tally stick]]), a [[bridle]], [[Weighing scale#Symbolism|scales]], a [[sword]], and a [[scourge]], and she rides in a [[chariot]] drawn by [[Griffin|griffins]].

==Fortune and retribution==
The word ''Nemesis'' originally meant the distributor of fortune, neither good nor bad, simply in due proportion to each according to what was deserved.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Later, ''nemesis'' came to suggest the resentment caused by any disturbance of this right proportion, the sense of justice that could not allow it to pass unpunished.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[O. Gruppe]] (1906) and others connect the name with "to feel just resentment". From the fourth century onward, Nemesis, as the just balancer of [[Fortuna (mythology)|Fortune]]'s chance, could be associated with [[Tyche]].

In the [[Greek tragedies]] Nemesis appears chiefly as the avenger of crime and the punisher of [[hubris]], and as such is akin to [[Atë]] and the [[Erinyes]]. She was sometimes called "[[Adrestia|Adrasteia]]", probably meaning "one from whom there is no escape"; her epithet ''Erinys'' ("implacable") is specially applied to Demeter and the [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] mother goddess, [[Cybele]].

==Family==

By [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]], 1808]]
Nemesis has been described as the daughter of [[Oceanus]] or [[Zeus]], but according to [[Hyginus]] she was a child of [[Erebus]] and [[Nyx]]. She has also been described, by [[Hesiod]], as the daughter of Nyx alone. In the [[Theogony]], Nemesis is the sister of the [[Moirai]] (the Fates), the [[Keres (mythology)|Keres]] (Black Fates), the [[Oneiroi]] (Dreams), [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]] (Discord) and [[Apate (deity)|Apate]] (Deception)

===Progeny===

====Helen====
[[File:Leda - after Michelangelo Buonarroti.jpg|thumb|302x302px|''[[Leda and the Swan (Michelangelo)|Leda and the Swan]]'', copy of [[Michelangelo]]'s lost painting.]]
In some metaphysical mythology, Nemesis produced the egg from which hatched two sets of twins: [[Helen of Troy]] and [[Clytemnestra]], and the [[Dioscuri]], [[Castor and Pollux]]. While many myths indicate [[Zeus]] and [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] to be the parents of [[Helen of Troy]], the author of the compilation of myth called ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' notes the possibility of Nemesis being the mother of Helen. Nemesis, to avoid Zeus, turns into a goose, but he turns into a swan and mates with her. Nemesis in her bird form lays an egg that is discovered in the marshes by a shepherd, who passes the egg to [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]]. It is in this way that [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] comes to be the mother of [[Helen of Troy]], as she kept the egg in a chest until it hatched.&lt;ref&gt;(Pseudo-Apollodorus) R. Scott Smith, Stephen Trzaskoma, and Hyginus. ''Apollodorus' Library and Hyginus' Fabulae: Two Handbooks of Greek Mythology''. Indianapolis: Hackett Pub., 2007:60.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stasinus of Cyprus or Hegesias of Aegina, Cypria Fragment 8 (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th or C6th B.C.) :
&lt;blockquote&gt;Rich-haired Nemesis gave birth to her [Helene (Helen)] when she had been joined in love with Zeus the king of the gods by harsh violence. For Nemesis tried to escape him and liked not to lie in love with her father Zeus the son of Kronos (Cronus); for shame and indignation vexed her heart: therefore she fled him over the land and fruitless dark sea. But Zeus ever pursued and longed in his heart to catch her. Now she took the form of a fish and sped over the waves of the loud-roaring sea, and now over Okeanos' (Oceanus') stream and the furthest bounds of Earth, and now she sped over the furrowed land, always turning into such dread creatures as the dry land nurtures, that she might escape him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 127 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.) :
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nemesis, as she fled from Zeus' embrace, took the form of a goose; whereupon Zeus as a swan had intercourse with her. From this union, she laid an egg, which some herdsman found among the trees and handed over to Lede (Leda). She kept it in a box, and when Helene was hatched after the proper length of time, she reared her as her own.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Pausanias, Description of Greece 1. 33. 4 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.) :
&lt;blockquote&gt;I will now go on to describe what is figures on the pedestal of the statue [of Nemesis at Rhamnos], having made this preface for the sake of clearness. The Greeks say that Nemesis was the mother of Helene (Helen), while Leda suckled and nursed her. The father of Helene the Greeks like everybody else hold to be not [[Tyndareus|Tyndareos]] (Tyndareus) but Zeus. Having heard this legend [the sculptor] Pheidias has represented Helene as being led to Nemesis by Leda, and he has represented Tyndareos and his children.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Pseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 8 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :
&lt;blockquote&gt;Constellation Swan ([[Cycnus|Cygnus]]). When Jupiter [Zeus], moved by desire, had begun to love Nemesis, and couldn't persuade her to lie with him, he relieved his passion by the following plan. He bade Venus [[Aphrodite]], in the form of an eagle, pursue him; he, changed to a swan as if in flight from the eagle, took refuge with Nemesis and lighted in her lap. Nemesis did not thrust him away, but holding him in her arms, fell into a deep sleep. While she slept, Jupiter [Zeus] embraced her and then flew away. Because he was seen by men flying high in the sky, they said he was put in the stars. To make this really true, Jupiter put the swan flying and the eagle pursuing in the sky. But Nemesis, as if wedded to the tribe of birds, when her months were ended, bore an egg. Mercurius (Mercury) [[Hermes]] took it away and carried it to Sparta and threw it in Leda's lap. From it sprang Helen, who excelled all other girls in beauty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Telchines====
One source of the myth says that Nemesis was the mother of the [[Telchines]], whom others say were children of [[Pontus (mythology)|Pontus]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaea]] or [[Thalassa (mythology)|Thalassa]].
* Bacchylides, Fragment 52 (from Tzetzes on Theogony) (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric IV) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :
&lt;blockquote&gt;The four famous Telkhines (Telchines), [[Actaeus|Aktaios]] (Actaeus), [[Megalesius|Megalesios]] (Megalesius), [[Ormenus|Ormenos]] (Ormenus) and [[Lycus (mythology)|Lykos]] (Lycus), whom [[Bacchylides|Bakkhylides]] (Bacchylides) calls the children of Nemesis and Tartaros.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[N.B. Tartaros is the spirit of the great pit beneath the earth.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Acts and deeds==
Although a respected goddess, Nemesis brought much sorrow to mortals such as [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]] and [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]]. Narcissus was a very beautiful and arrogant hunter from the territory of [[Thespiae]] and [[Boeotia]], who disdained the ones who loved him. Nemesis lured him to a pool where he saw his own reflection in the water and fell in love with it, not realizing it was only an image. He was unable to leave the beauty of his reflection and he eventually died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ovid.lib.virginia.edu/trans/Metamorph3.htm#476975712|title=Metamorphoses (Kline) 3, the Ovid Collection, Univ. of Virginia E-Text Center|work=virginia.edu|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nemesis believed that no one should ever have too much goodness in their lives, and she had always cursed those who were blessed with countless gifts.

==Local cult==
A festival called '''Nemeseia''' (by some identified with the '''Genesia''') was held at [[Athens]]. Its object was to avert the nemesis of the dead, who were supposed to have the power of punishing the living, if their cult had been in any way neglected ([[Sophocles]], ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]],'' 792; [[E. Rohde]], ''Psyche,'' 1907, i. 236, note I).

===Smyrna===
[[File:HadrianNemesis.jpg|thumb|''Nemesis'' on a brass [[sestertius]] of [[Hadrian]], struck at [[Rome]] AD 136]]
At [[Smyrna]] there were two manifestations of Nemesis, more akin to [[Aphrodite]] than to Artemis. The reason for this duality is hard to explain. It is suggested that they represent two aspects of the goddess, the kindly and the implacable, or the goddesses of the old city and the new city refounded by Alexander. The martyrology ''Acts of [[Pionius]]'', set in the "[[Decius|Decian persecution]]" of AD 250–51, mentions a lapsed Smyrnan Christian who was attending to the sacrifices at the altar of the temple of these Nemeses.

===Rome===
Nemesis was one of several [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] of the drill-ground (as ''Nemesis campestris''). Modern scholarship offers little support for the once-prevalent notion that arena personnel such as [[gladiator]]s, ''venatores'' and ''bestiarii'' were personally or professionally dedicated to her cult. Rather, she seems to have represented a kind of "Imperial [[Fortuna]]" who dispensed Imperial retribution on the one hand, and Imperially subsidised gifts on the other; both were functions of the popular gladiatorial [[Ludi]] held in Roman arenas.&lt;ref&gt;Nemesis, her devotees and her place in the Roman world are fully discussed, with examples, in Hornum, Michael B., ''Nemesis, the Roman state and the games'', Brill, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; She is shown on a few examples of Imperial coinage as ''Nemesis-Pax'', mainly under [[Claudius]] and [[Hadrian]]. In the third century AD, there is evidence of the belief in an all-powerful ''Nemesis-Fortuna''. She was worshipped by a society called Hadrian's freedmen.

[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] includes her in a digression on Justice following his description of the death of Gallus Caesar.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Noise control''' or '''noise mitigation''' is a set of strategies to reduce [[noise pollution]] or to reduce the impact of that noise, whether outdoors or indoors.

==Overview==
The main areas of noise mitigation or abatement are: [[transportation]] noise control, [[architecture|architectural]] design, [[urban planning]] through [[zoning codes]],&lt;ref&gt;Benz Kotzen, [http://blogs.gre.ac.uk/architecture/2010/10/03/open-lecture-benz-kotzen-noise-is-an-urban-issue/ "Noise is an urban issue"]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[industrial noise|occupational noise]] control. [[Roadway noise]] and [[aircraft noise]] are the most pervasive sources of [[environmental noise]]. Social activities may generate noise levels that consistently affect the health of populations residing in or occupying areas, both indoor and outdoor, near entertainment venues that feature amplified sounds and music that present significant challenges for effective noise mitigation strategies.

Multiple techniques have been developed to address interior sound levels, many of which are encouraged by local [[building code]]s; in the best case of project designs, planners are encouraged to work with [[design engineer]]s to examine trade-offs of roadway design and architectural design. These techniques include design of exterior walls, party walls, and floor and ceiling assemblies; moreover, there are a host of specialized means for damping reverberation from special-purpose rooms such as [[auditorium|auditoria]], [[concert hall]]s, entertainment and social venues, dining areas, audio recording rooms, and meeting rooms.

Many of these techniques rely upon materials science applications of constructing [[sound baffle]]s or using sound-absorbing liners for interior spaces. Industrial noise control is a subset of interior architectural control of noise, with emphasis on specific methods of sound isolation from industrial machinery and for protection of workers at their task stations.

[[Sound masking]] is the active addition of noise to reduce the annoyance of certain sounds; the opposite of [[soundproofing]].

&lt;br /&gt;

== Standards and Recommendations ==
Organizations each have their own standards, recommendations, and directives for what levels of noise workers are permitted to be around before noise controls must be put into place.

=== Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ===
OSHA's requirements state that when workers are exposed to noise levels above 90 A-weighted decibels (dBA) in 8-hour time-weighted averages (TWA), administrative controls and/or new engineering controls must be implemented in the workplace. OSHA also requires that impulse noises and impact noises must be controlled to prevent these noises reaching past 140 dB peak sound pressure levels (SPL).&lt;ref&gt;Occupational Health and Safety Administration. (1983). Occupational noise exposure; hearing conservation amendment, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 CFR 1910.95. ''Federal Register.'' 48(46): 9738-9785.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Mine Safety and Health Organization (MSHA) ===
MSHA requires that administrative and/ or engineering controls must be implemented in the workplace when miners are exposed to levels above 90 dBA TWA. If noise levels exceed 115 dBA, miners are required to wear hearing protection. MSHA, therefore, requires that noise levels be reduced below 115 dB TWA. Measuring noise levels for noise control decision making must integrate all noises from 90dBA to 140 dBA. &lt;ref&gt;Mine Safety and Health Administration. (1999). ''Health Standards for Occupational Noise Exposure: Final Rule'' (30 CFR Part 62, 64 Fed. Reg. 49548-49634, 49636-49637). Arlington, VA: Mine Safety and Health Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Federal Railroad Association (FRA) ===
The FRA recommends that worker exposure to noise should be reduced when their noise exposure exceeds 90 dBA 8-hour TWA. Noise measurements must integrate all noises, including intermittent, continuous, impact, and impulse noises between 80 dBA to 140 dBA.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Railroad Administration (2008). 71 FR 63123, Oct. 27, 2006, as amended at 73 FR 79702, Dec. 30 2008. Part 227. ''Occupational Noise Exposure.'' Washington, DC: Federal Railroad Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) ===
The DoD suggests that noise levels be controlled primarily through engineering controls. The DoD requires that all steady-state noises be reduced to levels below 85 dBA and that impulse noises be reduced below 140 dB peak SPL. Time Weighted Average exposures are not considered for the DoD's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Defense. (2004). ''Instruction 6055.12. DoD Hearing Conservation Program.'' Washington, DC: Department of Defense.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== European Parliament and Council Directive ===
The European Parliament and Council directive require noise levels to be reduced or eliminated using administrative and engineering controls. This directive requires lower exposure action levels of 80 dBA for 8 hours with 135 dB peak SPL, along with upper exposure action levels of 85 dBA for 8 hours with 137 peak dBSPL. Exposure limits are 87 dBA for 8 hours with peak levels of 140 peak dBSPL.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament and Council. (2003). ''Directive 2003/10/EC on the Minimum Health and Safety Requirements Regarding the Exposure of Workers to the Risks Arising from Physical Agents (Noise).'' Seventeenth individual Directive within the meaning of the Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC). ''Off J Eur Union.'' L42/38/-L42/44. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Approaches to Noise Control ==
An effective model for noise control is the source, path, and receiver model by Bolt and Ingard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Noise Control|last1=Harris|first1=CM|date=1957|publisher=McGraw-Hill:22-31|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazardous noise can be controlled by reducing the noise output at its source, minimizing the noise as it travels along a path to the listener, and providing equipment to the listener or receiver to attenuate the noise.

=== Source ===
A variety of measures aim to reduce hazardous noise at its source. Programs such as [[Buy Quiet]] and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) [[Prevention through design]] promote research and design of quiet equipment and renovation and replacement of older hazardous equipment with modern technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-121/|title=Prevention Through Design: Plan for the National Initiative|website=Centers for Disease Control|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical materials, such as foam to absorb sound and walls to provide a sound barrier, modify existing systems to decrease hazardous noise at the source.

=== Path ===
The principle of noise reduction through pathway modifications applies to the alteration of direct and indirect pathways for noise.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hearing Conservation in Occupational, Recreational, Educational, and Home Settings|last1=Rawool|first1=Vishakha|date=2012|publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.|isbn=978-1-60406-256-4|edition=First|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noise that travels across reflective surfaces such as smooth floors can be hazardous. Pathway alterations include sound dampening enclosures for loud equipment and isolation chambers from which workers can remotely control equipment while removed from noise. These methods prevent sound from traveling along a path to the worker or other listener.

=== Receiver ===
In the industrial or commercial setting, workers must comply with the appropriate [[Hearing conservation program]]. [[Administrative controls]] such as the restriction of personnel in noisy areas prevent unnecessary noise exposure. [[Personal protective equipment]] such as foam [[Earplug|ear plugs]] or [[Earmuffs|ear muffs]] to attenuate sound provide a last line of defense for the listener.

== Basic technologies ==
{{see also|Acoustic quieting}}
* [[Sound insulation]]: prevent the transmission of noise by the introduction of a mass barrier. Common materials have high-density properties such as brick, thick glass, concrete, metal etc.
* [[Sound absorption]]:  a porous material which acts as a ‘noise sponge’ by converting the sound energy into heat within the material. Common sound absorption materials include decoupled lead-based tiles, open cell foams and fiberglass
* [[Vibration damping]]: applicable for large vibrating surfaces. The damping mechanism works by extracting the vibration energy from the thin sheet and dissipating it as heat. A common material is sound deadened steel.
* [[Vibration isolation]]: prevents transmission of vibration energy from a source to a receiver by introducing a flexible element or a physical break. Common vibration isolators are springs, rubber mounts, cork etc.

==Roadways==
{{Main|Noise barrier}}
[[File:Geluidscherm Overschie.jpg|thumb|This noise abatement wall in The Netherlands has a transparent section at the driver's eye-level to reduce the visual impact for road users.]]
Source control in [[roadway noise]] has provided little reduction in vehicle noise, except for the development of the [[hybrid vehicle]]; nevertheless, hybrid use will need to attain a market share of roughly fifty percent to have a major impact on noise source reduction of city streets.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} [[Highway]] noise is today less affected by [[Engine|motor]] type, since the effects in higher speed are [[aerodynamic]] and [[tire]] noise related.  Other contributions to reduction of noise at the source are: improved tire [[tread]] designs for [[truck]]s in the 1970s, better shielding of diesel stacks in the 1980s, and local vehicle regulation of [[muffler|unmuffled]] vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soundcontroltech.com/tire-pavement-noise/|title=Tire-Pavement Noise {{!}} Sound Control|website=soundcontroltech.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most fertile areas for roadway noise mitigation are in urban planning decisions, roadway design, [[noise barrier]] design,&lt;ref&gt;Benz Kotzen and Colin English, ''Environmental Noise Barriers: A Guide to Their Visual and Acoustic Design'', Spon Press, United Kingdom (1999) {{ISBN|978-0-419-23180-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; speed control, surface pavement selection and truck restrictions.  Speed control is effective since the lowest sound emissions arise from vehicles moving smoothly at 30 to 60 kilometres per hour.  Above that range, sound emissions double with each five miles per hour of speed. At the lowest speeds, braking and (engine) acceleration noise dominates.

Selection of road surface pavement can make a difference of a factor of two in sound levels, for the speed regime above 30 kilometres per hour.  Quieter pavements are porous with a negative surface texture and use medium to small aggregates; the loudest pavements have a transversely grooved surface, and/or a positive surface texture and use larger aggregates.  Surface friction and roadway safety are important considerations as well for pavement decisions.

When designing new urban freeways or arterials, there are numerous design decisions regarding alignment and roadway geometrics.&lt;ref&gt;Myer Kutz, ''Handbook of Transportation Engineering'',  McGraw-Hill (2004) {{ISBN|978-0-07-139122-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of a [[computer model]] to calculate sound levels has become standard practice since the early 1970s. In this way exposure of sensitive receptors to elevated sound levels can be minimized. An analogous process exists for urban [[mass transit]] systems and other rail transportation decisions. Early examples of urban rail systems designed using this technology were: [[Boston]] [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] line expansions (1970s), [[San Francisco]] [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] system expansion (1981), [[Houston]] [[METRORail]] system (1982), and the [[MAX Light Rail]] system in [[Portland, Oregon]] (1983).

Noise barriers can be applicable for existing or planned surface transportation projects. They are probably the single most effective weapon in retrofitting an existing roadway, and commonly can reduce adjacent land use sound levels by up to ten decibels. A computer model is required to design the barrier since terrain, [[microscale meteorology|micrometeorology]] and other locale specific factors make the endeavor a very complex undertaking. For example, a roadway in cut or strong prevailing winds can produce a setting where atmospheric sound propagation is unfavorable to any noise barrier.

==Aircraft==
{{Main|Aircraft noise}}
[[File:Airbus A321 (British AW) - Aviation noise.jpg|thumb|A [[British Airways]] [[Airbus A321-211|Airbus A321]], on landing approach to London [[Heathrow Airport]], showing proximity to homes.]]

As in the case of roadway noise, little progress has been made in quelling aircraft noise at the source, other than elimination of loud engine designs from the 1960s and earlier.  Because of its velocity and volume, jet turbine engine exhaust noise defies reduction by any simple means.

The most promising forms of aircraft noise abatement are through land planning, flight operations restrictions and residential [[soundproofing]]. Flight restrictions can take the form of preferred runway use, departure flight path and slope, and time-of-day restrictions. These tactics are sometimes controversial since they can impact aircraft safety, flying convenience and airline economics.

In 1979, the [[US Congress]] authorized&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979]] (ASNAA)'', 49 U.S.C. 47501-47510&lt;/ref&gt; the [[FAA]] to devise technology and programs to attempt to insulate homes near airports. While this obviously does not aid the exterior environment, the program has been effective for residential and school interiors. Some of the first airports at which the technology was applied were [[San Francisco International Airport]],&lt;ref&gt;''Final Report for the Aircraft [[Noise Insulation]] Project for [[San Francisco International Airport]]: Phase one Pilot Project'', [[FAA]] funded and prepared for the city of South San Francisco, Earth Metrics Inc., Burlingame, California, July, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]], [[John Wayne International Airport]] and [[San Jose International Airport]]&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan and Ballard George, ''Pilot Noise Residential Insulation Program'', [[San Jose International Airport]] (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; in California.

The underlying technology is a computer model which simulates the propagation of aircraft noise and its penetration into buildings. Variations in aircraft types, flight patterns and local meteorology can be analyzed along with benefits of alternative building [[retrofit]] strategies such as roof upgrading, window [[glazing in architecture|glazing]] improvement, [[fireplace]] baffling, [[caulk]]ing construction seams and other measures. The computer model allows cost effectiveness evaluations of a host of alternative strategies.

In Canada, [[Transport Canada]] prepares noise exposure forecasts (NEF) for each airport, using a computer model similar to that used in the US. Residential land development is discouraged within high impact areas identified by the forecast.&lt;ref&gt;Transport Canada [http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/standards/aerodromeairnav-standards-noise-nef-924.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the flight paths in all of [[Scandinavia]] were changed as the new [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Oslo-Gardermoen Airport]] was opened. These new paths were straighter, reducing fuel use, and disturbing fewer people, however, vociferous protests came from people near the new paths who had not been disturbed before, and they took legal action ([[NIMBY]] effect).

==Architectural solutions==
{{Main|Architectural acoustics}}

Architectural acoustics noise control practices include: interior sound reverberation reduction, inter-room noise transfer mitigation and exterior building skin augmentation.

In the case of construction of new (or remodeled) [[apartment]]s, [[condominium]]s, [[hospital]]s, and [[hotel]]s, many states and cities have stringent building codes with requirements of acoustical analysis, in order to protect building occupants.  With regard to exterior noise, the codes usually require measurement of the exterior acoustic environment in order to determine the performance standard required for exterior building skin design.  The architect can work with the acoustical scientist to arrive at the best cost-effective means of creating a quiet interior (normally 45 [[A-weighting|dBA]]).  The most important elements of design of the building skin are usually: [[glazing in architecture|glazing]] (glass thickness, double pane design etc.), [[perforated metal]] (used internally or externally),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=William|title=Perforated metal systems sound absorbing surfaces|journal=Construction Specifier|date=February 2007|url=http://www.ssaacoustics.com/newspublications/perforated%20metal%20systems%20as%20sound%20absorbative%20surf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  roof material, caulking standards, [[chimney]] baffles, exterior door design, mail slots, [[attic]] [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] ports, and mounting of through-the-wall air conditioners.

Regarding sound generated inside the building, there are two principal types of transmission.  Firstly, airborne sound travels through walls or floor and ceiling assemblies and can emanate from either human activities in adjacent living spaces or from mechanical noise within the building systems.  Human activities might include voice, noise from amplified sound systems, or  animal noise.  Mechanical systems are [[elevator]] systems, [[boiler]]s, [[refrigeration]] or [[air conditioning]] systems, [[Electrical generator|generator]]s and trash compactors.  [[Aerodynamic]] sources include fans, pneumatics, and combustion.  Noise control for aerodynamic sources include [[air nozzle|quiet air nozzles]], [[muffler|pneumatic silencers]] and [[Quiet PC#Fans|quiet fan technology]].  Since many mechanical sounds are inherently loud, the principal design element is to require the wall or ceiling assembly to meet certain performance standards,&lt;ref&gt;Cyril M. Harris, ''Noise Control in Buildings: A Practical Guide for Architects and Engineers'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; (typically [[Sound transmission class]] of 50), which allows considerable attenuation of the sound level reaching occupants.

The second type of interior sound is called Impact Insulation Class (IIC) transmission.  This effect arises not from [[airborne transmission]], but rather from transmission of sound through the building itself.  The most common perception of IIC noise is from footfall of occupants in living spaces above. Low frequency noise is transferred easily through the ground and buildings. This type of noise is more difficult to abate, but consideration must be given to isolating the floor assembly above or hanging the lower ceiling on [[resilient channel]].

Both of the transmission effects noted above may emanate either from building occupants or from building [[mechanical system]]s such as elevators, plumbing systems or heating, ventilating and air conditioning units.  In some cases it is merely necessary to specify the best available quieting technology in selecting such building hardware.  In other cases shock mounting of systems to control vibration may be in order.  In the case of plumbing systems there are specific protocols developed, especially for water supply lines, to create isolation clamping of pipes within building walls.  In the case of central air systems, it is important to baffle any ducts that could transmit sound between different building areas.

Designing special-purpose rooms has more exotic challenges, since these rooms may have requirements for unusual features such as [[concert]] performance, [[recording studio|sound studio recording]], lecture halls.  In these cases [[reverberation]] and reflection must be analyzed in order to not only quiet the rooms, but to prevent echo effects from occurring.  In these situations special [[sound baffle]]s and sound absorptive lining materials may be specified to dampen unwanted effects.

===Materials===
Acoustical wall and ceiling panels can be constructed of many different materials and finishes. The ideal acoustical panels are those without a face or finish material that interferes with the acoustical infill or substrate.  Fabric covered panels are one way to maximize the acoustical absorption. The finish material is used to cover over the acoustical substrate. Mineral fiber board, or Micore, is a commonly used acoustical substrate. Finish materials often consist of fabric, wood or metal. Fabric can be wrapped around substrates to create what is referred to as a "pre-fabricated panel" if laid onto a wall, and require no modifications. Such fabrics are generally acoustically 'transparent, meaning that they do not impede a sound wave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technature.ca Technature Inc. | Acoustic Products &amp; Soundproofing Materials&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prefabricated panels are limited to the size of the subas "on-site acoustical wall panels" This is constructed by "framing" the perimeter track into shape, infilling the acoustical substrate and then stretching and tucking the fabric into the perimeter frame system. On-site wall panels can be constructed to work around door frames, baseboard, or any other intrusion. Large panels (generally greater than 50 feet) can be created on walls and ceilings with this method.

Double-glazed and thicker windows can also prevent sound transmission from the outdoors.

==Industrial==
{{Main|Industrial noise}}
Industrial noise is traditionally associated with manufacturing settings where industrial machinery produces intense sound levels,&lt;ref&gt;Randall F Barron and Barron F Barron, ''[[Industrial noise|Industrial Noise]] Control and Acoustics'', Marcel Dekker, New York (2002) {{ISBN|978-0-8247-0701-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; often upwards of 85 decibels.  While this circumstance is the most dramatic, there are many other work environments where sound levels may lie in the range of 70 to 75 decibels, entirely composed of office equipment, music, public address systems, and even exterior noise intrusion. Either type of environment may result in [[noise health effects]] if the sound intensity and exposure time is too great.

In the case of industrial equipment, the most common techniques for noise protection of workers consist of shock mounting source equipment, creation of [[acrylic glass]] or other solid barriers, and provision of [[earplug|ear protection equipment]]. In certain cases the machinery itself can be re-designed to operate in a manner less prone to produce grating, grinding, frictional, or other motions that induce sound emissions. In recent years, [[Buy Quiet]] programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourage manufacturers to design quieter equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html CDC - Buy Quiet - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of more conventional office environments, the techniques in architectural acoustics discussed above may apply. Other solutions may involve researching the quietest models of office equipment, particularly printers and photocopy machines.  [[Impact printer]]s and other equipment were often fitted with "acoustic hoods", enclosures to reduce emitted noise. One source of annoying, if not loud, sound level emissions are lighting fixtures (notably older fluorescent globes).  These fixtures can be retrofitted or analyzed to see whether [[over-illumination]] is present, a common office environment issue. If over-illumination is occurring, de-lamping or reduced light bank usage may apply. Photographers can quieten noisy still cameras on a film set using [[sound blimp]]s.

==Commercial==
Reductions in cost of technology have allowed noise control technology to be used not only in performance facilities and recording studios, but also in noise-sensitive small businesses such as restaurants.&lt;ref name=SFGate20120513&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/High-tech-system-lets-restaurant-set-noise-level-3554029.php |title=High-tech system lets restaurant set noise level |last=Finz |first=Stacy |date=May 13, 2012 |website=San Francisco Chronicle |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6I9oil12S?url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/High-tech-system-lets-restaurant-set-noise-level-3554029.php |archivedate=July 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acoustically absorbent materials such as fiberglass duct liner, wood fiber panels and recycled denim jeans serve as artwork-bearing canvasses in environments in which aesthetics are important.&lt;ref name=SFGate20120513/&gt;

Using a combination of sound absorption materials, arrays of microphones and speakers, and a digital processor, a restaurant operator can use a tablet computer to selectively control noise levels at different places in the restaurant: the microphone arrays pick up sound and send it to the digital processor, which controls the speakers to output sound signals on command.&lt;ref name=SFGate20120513/&gt;

==Urban planning==
Communities may use zoning codes to isolate noisy urban activities from areas that should be protected from such unhealthy exposures and to establish noise standards in areas that may not be conducive to such isolation strategies. Because low-income neighborhoods are often at greater risk of noise pollution, the establishment of such zoning codes is often an environmental justice issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Identifying the Vulnerable Groups|url = http://web.mit.edu/urbanupgrading/urbanenvironment/issues/vulnerable-groups.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed use areas present especially difficult conflicts that require special attention to the need to protect people from the harmful effects of noise pollution.  Noise is generally one consideration in an [[environmental impact statement]], if applicable (such as transportation system construction).

An '''oil content meter''' (OCM) is an integral part of all [[oily water separator (marine)|oily water separator]] (OWS) systems.  '''Oil content meters''' are also sometimes referred to as oil content monitors, [[bilge]] alarms, or bilge monitors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== OCM technology ==

The OCM continuously monitors how much oil is in the water that is pumped out the discharge line of the OWS system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = TN2 Oil Content Meter|url = http://www.ajsinclair.com/alex-sinclair_files/TN2OilContentMeter.pdf|website = www.ajsinclair.com|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OCM will not allow the oil concentration of the exiting water to be above the [[MARPOL 73/78|Marpol]] standard of 15 ppm.  This standard was first adopted in 1977 with Resolution A.393(X) which was published by [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chronology &amp; Search|url = http://www.martinottaway.com/technical-documents/MAX1-Studies/chronology|website = MAX1 Studies|accessdate = 2015-07-15|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185609/http://www.martinottaway.com/technical-documents/MAX1-Studies/chronology#|archive-date = 4 March 2016|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standards were updated various but the most current resolution is MEPC 107(49).  The oil content meter will sound an [[Alarm device|alarm]] if the liquid leaving the system has an unsatisfactory amount of oil in the mixture.  If it is still above that standard, then the bilge water will be reentered into the system until it meets the required criteria.  The OCM uses light beams to determine how oily the water in the system is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Statutory Info – Bahamas – Oily Water Separator and 15 ppm oil content meter|url = http://www1.veristar.com/veristar/Dps_Info.nsf/AllByDate/849AB443FAA7E702C1257DA20060FCF0?opendocument|website = www1.veristar.com|accessdate = 2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system will then gauge the oil concentration based on a light intensity meter.  Modern '''oil content meters''' also have a data logging system that can store oil concentration measurements for more than 18 months.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:No. 100 Oil content meter.jpg|thumb|Oil content meter]]
If the OCM determines that there is far too much of a type of oil, the OCM may be fouled and needs to be flushed out.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Running clean water through the OCM sensor cell is one way it can be cleaned.  Also scrubbing the sensor area with a bottle brush is another effective method.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.martinottaway.com/sites/martinottaway.com/files/content/documents/whitepapers/Initial_Recommendations_for_Bilge_Oily_Water_Separator_System_Design_and_Operation.pdf|url = http://www.martinottaway.com/sites/martinottaway.com/files/content/documents/whitepapers/Initial_Recommendations_for_Bilge_Oily_Water_Separator_System_Design_and_Operation.pdf|website = www.martinottaway.com|accessdate = 2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new MEPC 107(49) regulations have set out stringent actions that require the OCM to be tamper proof and also the OCM needs to have an alarm that sounds whenever the OCM is being cleaned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When the alarm goes off, the OCM functionality will be checked by crew members.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

An OCM is a small part of what is called the [[Oil discharge monitoring equipment|oil discharge monitoring and control system]].  The first part is the oil content meter. The second is a flow meter which measures the flow rate of the water at the discharge pipe.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Oil Discharge Monitoring and Control System (ODMCS) on Ship?|url = http://www.marineinsight.com/misc/maritime-law/what-is-oil-discharge-monitoring-and-control-system-odmcs-on-ship/|accessdate = 2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, is a computing unit which calculates how much oil has actually been discharged along with the day and time of the discharge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; And lastly is the overboard valve control system which is essentially just a [[valve]] that can stop the discharge from flowing out at the appropriate time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Oil content meters measure how effective the oily water separators on a ship are functioning.&lt;ref name="mackaycomm.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Deckma OMD-24 – Oil Content Meter {{!}} Mackay Communications and Marine Electronics and Service|url = http://www.mackaycomm.com/products/belowdecks/oilywatermonitors/deckma-omd-24-oil-content-meter|website = www.mackaycomm.com|accessdate = 2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the OCM computes that the oily discharge is above the 15 ppm standard, the [[Oily Water Separator (marine)|oily water separator]] needs to be checked by the crew.

There are three types of oil that the oil content meter needs to check for and they are [[fuel oil]], [[diesel fuel|diesel]], and [[emulsions]].&lt;ref name="mackaycomm.com"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British naturalist, wildlife photographer, author and early nature documentary pioneer, specialising in the study of bird life. "His claim to significance," according to Bryony Dixon of BFI Screenonline, "lies in the groundbreaking techniques he developed to capture animals in their natural habitats and in the fact that he passed this knowledge on."&lt;ref name="BFIso01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pike, Oliver (1877–1963) |first=Bryony |last=Dixon |coauthors= |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1269611/index.html |work=BFI Screenonline |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WFH01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Oliver Pike |first= |last= |coauthors= |url=http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/person/184/Oliver+Pike.html |work=wildfilmhistory.org |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Pike studied at [[Enfield Grammar School]] until 1893, where he became friends with local commercial photographer and ornithologist [[Reginald Badham Lodge]], who specialised in bird photography. Pike accompanied Lodge while he worked, taking his first photograph of a wild flower at the age of 13, in the autumn of 1890. In 1895 the two invented a bird-activated trip-wire releases, which effectively allowed birds to take their own pictures. Pike developed a profound knowledge of photographic techniques and went on to publish a series of 25 handbooks on ornithological photography and cinematography, starting with ''In Birdland with Field Glass and Camera'' (1900). He also developed his own stills camera, marketed as ''The Birdland Camera'' by Sanders &amp; Crowhurst of Shaftesbury Avenue, London, and later a cine-camera for wildlife photography that was camouflaged so as not to frighten off the subjects.&lt;ref name="BN-XXV-1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pike|first=Oliver G|date=Winter 1951|title=Early Bird Photography|journal=Bird Notes|publisher=[[RSPB|Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]]|volume=XXV|issue=1|pages=21–22,25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Climbing Hateley Shute YORYM-S164.jpg|thumb|A local man (bottom left -blurry) climb's Hateley Shute on Flamborough Head in around 1908 ]]
Pike's first film, ''In Birdland'', which premiered at the [[Palace Theatre, London]] in August 1907, was the first British wildlife film to be screened to a fee paying audience. Together with cinematographer [[Harold Armytage Sanders]], Pike took great physical risks hanging from ropes over coastal cliffs to capture unprecedented footage of Britain's seabirds, including kittiwakes, gannets, cormorants and puffins. The film proved hugely popular in its 6-week run with over 100 additional prints were made for screenings across the UK. All copies are now however believed lost or destroyed. He made two more films along a similar theme, ''St Kilda, Its People and Birds'' (1908) and ''Cliff Climbing – The Egg Harvest of Flamborough Head'' (1908), before becoming director of photography for [[Pathé|Pathé Frères]] from 1910 to 1920, where he made ''Glimpses of Bird Life'' (1910), noted for its use of positioning which was "years ahead of their time" and "helped to establish British wildlife photographers as leaders in this field."&lt;ref name="WFHtcs02"&gt;{{cite web |title=In Birdland (1907) |first= |last= |coauthors= |url=http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/film/343/In+Birdland.html |work=wildfilmhistory.org |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WFH03"&gt;{{cite web |title=St. Kilda, Its People and Birds (1908) |first= |last= |coauthors= |url=http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/film/14/St.+Kilda%2C+Its+People+and+Birds.html |work=wildfilmhistory.org |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFIso02"&gt;{{cite web |title=St. Kilda, Its People and Birds (1908) |first=Bryony |last=Dixon |coauthors= |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1264987/index.html |work=BFI Screenonlinee |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFIso03"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cliff Climbing  – The Egg Harvest of Flamborough Head (1908) |first=Bryony |last=Dixon |coauthors= |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/514132/index.html |work=BFI Screenonlinee |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFIso04"&gt;{{cite web |title=Glimpses of Bird Life (1910) |first=Bryony |last=Dixon |coauthors= |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1271010/index.html |work=BFI Screenonlinee |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, Pike went to work for old friend Harry Bruce Wolfe at British Instructional Films on the single-reel series ''Secrets of Nature'' series. His inaugural film for the series was ''The Cuckoo's Secret'' (1922), commissioned by [[Edgar Chance]], which changed public perception of how [[common cuckoo]]s reproduce by providing the first proof that they lay their eggs directly in the nests of the species they parasitise rather than laying them on the ground and carrying them to the nest. Over the course of the next 11 years, Smith blended "nature photography with painstaking laboratory work," on the series, "providing an atmospheric account of British wildlife," which filmmaker, historian and critic [[Paul Rotha]] described in 1930 as "the sheet anchor of the British film industry." He later went on to work for Gaumont-British Instructional Films on the similar ''Secrets of Life'' series, where he made the controversial ''A Family of Great Tits'' (1934), highlighting the brutality of nature with footage from a specially constructed nesting box. Working until 1947, he made over 50 films many of which showed animal behaviour that had never before been recorded.&lt;ref name="WFHtcs04"&gt;{{cite web |title=Secrets of Nature: The Cuckoo's Secret (1922) |first= |last= |coauthors= |url=http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/film/296/The+Cuckoos+Secret.html |work=wildfilmhistory.org |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFIso05"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cuckoo's Secret, The (1922) |first=Bryony |last=Dixon |coauthors= |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1354742/index.html |work=BFI Screenonlinee |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WFH05"&gt;{{cite web |title=Secrets of Nature: The Sparrow-Hawk (1922) |first= |last= |coauthors= |url=http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/film/37/37.html?filmid=37 |work=wildfilmhistory.org |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFIso06"&gt;{{cite web |title=Family of Great Tits, A (1934) |first=Bryony |last=Dixon |coauthors= |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1269043/index.html |work=BFI Screenonlinee |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pike, represented by the Thomas's Lecture Agency of Strand, London, was a popular speaker on wildlife subjects and lectured all over the United Kingdom. He was opposed to the [[egg collecting]], shooting and other [[blood sports]]. He joined the [[Royal Photographic Society]] in 1907 and gained his Fellowship the same year. He was made an Honorary Fellow in 1957. He exhibited and lectured extensively at the Society.&lt;ref&gt;Information provided by Dr Michael Pritchard, Chief Executive of The Royal Photographic Society&lt;/ref&gt; Some 300 prints, negatives and lantern-slides of his work, which were acquired from the London Natural History Society in 1974, are preserved in the RPS Collection at the [[National Media Museum]] in Bradford, along with one of his early cameras. He also donated several of his films to the BFI National Archive. He died in Leighton Buzzard in 1963.

'''One Less Nuclear Power Plant''' is the flagship energy policy launched in April 2012 by [[Seoul]], the capital city of the Republic of Korea, in its broad effort to respond to [[climate change]] and [[energy crisis]] in the aftermath of the [[Fukushima nuclear accident]] and the nationwide rolling blackout in 2011.

The main target of the One Less Nuclear Power plant was to cut energy consumption by 2 million [[Tonne of oil equivalent|TOE]], which is equivalent to the capacity of one [[nuclear power plant]], mainly by directly engaging citizens in energy-saving and renewable energy generation. This target was exceeded in June 2014, six months ahead of schedule, as Seoul reduced the city’s energy consumption by 2.04 million TOE.

The [[Seoul Metropolitan Government]] announced the launch of the second phase of the One Less Nuclear Power Plant, [[Seoul Sustainable Energy Action Plan]], in August 2014.

== Key Action Plans ==
With “Energy Generation, Energy Efficiency, and Energy-Saving,” at its core, the One Less Nuclear Power Plant took a multi-faceted approach, consisting of 71 specific projects in 6 policy categories, which can be re-categorized in 10 key action plans. The six policy categories include expanding renewable energy generation, improving building energy efficiency, promoting eco-friendly transportation system, generating green jobs, building a low energy-consuming city and creating a low energy-consuming civic culture.

== Key Achievements (as of June 2014) ==
The One Less Nuclear Power Plant presented set an example for local energy policies as it reached its target through unique means like Seoul Feed-in Tariff (FIT), and improved rent conditions for [[photovoltaic power]] generation. The significance of the One Less Nuclear Power Plant lies in the fact that it is a civic-participatory governance policy, under which citizens took the lead in policy development and implementation.

The energy-saving programs achieved the greatest cut in energy consumption at some 910,000 TOE, while energy efficiency and generation projects pushed down the total energy consumption by 870,000 TOE and 260,000 TOE respectively.

As a result, Seoul’s consumption of energy including electricity, city gas, and oil turned downward. In 2013, when tangible outcomes of the Ones Less Nuclear Power Plant started to surface, Seoul’s electricity consumption decreased by 1.4%, whereas the nationwide consumption jumped by 1.76%.

=== Energy generation ===
Under the One Less Nuclear Power Plant, the Seoul Metropolitan Government attracted of about 400 billion won in private capital to generate electricity from clean renewable sources that could be supplied to 300,000 households. 63.5 billion won out of the total private investment was used to establish 3,756 photovoltaic power generation systems with the combined capacity of 69 MW.

=== Energy efficiency ===
Seoul implemented Building Retrofit Program (BRP) on 20,000 buildings by offering loans with ultra-low interest rates of 1.75% and adopting a first-invest-return-later approach. Moreover, 6.79 million energy-efficient [[LED bulbs]] were introduced by Seoul. In particular, Seoul replaced 430,000 conventional bulbs in all 243 subway stations in the city with LED ones with the full financial support by the Korea Finance Corporation.

=== Energy-saving ===
The Eco-Mileage program, which incentivizes citizens’ energy-saving actions, saw its membership increase to 1.7 million, prompting energy-saving behaviors both at households and businesses. The Eco-Mileage program won the 2013 [[United Nations Public Service Awards|UN Public Service Award]] in the category of “Fostering participation in public policy decision making through innovative mechanisms.”

== Brand identity ==
The brand identity (BI) of One Less Nuclear Power Plant was designed to reflect the vision of Healing city, Healing earth. The BI was a winning project from a civic competition, which was later retouched by Mr. Dong-min Ahn, the President of Intergram Graphics, local marketing design firm.

== Slogan ==
:* Energy-saving people are the Green Power Plant that reduces one nuclear power plant
:* Energy culture changed by citizens, happy transition by Seoul 
:* Energy saved together, One Less Nuclear Power Plant achieved together
The slogans above were developed by citizens through a contest.

== Mascot ==
Dongeuri the Sunlight Angel is the mascot of One Less Nuclear Power Plant, symbolizing the face of Seoul citizens who both save and generate energy. Dongueri was designed and donated by Mr. Ho-seop Yoon, Honorary Professor of [[Kookmin University]].

The '''Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft''' also called the '''Oslo Convention''' was an [[international agreement]] designed to control the [[marine debris|dumping of harmful substances from ships and aircraft into the sea]].  It was adopted on February 15, 1972 in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] and came into force on April 7, 1974.  Original signatories were [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Iceland]], Norway, [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], and [[Sweden]]. Later members included the [[United Kingdom]] (1975), the [[Netherlands]] (1975), [[Germany]] (1977), [[Finland]] (1979), [[Ireland]] (1982), and [[Belgium]] (1985).  

The area covered by the treaty included the [[Atlantic]] and [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] Oceans north of [[36th parallel north|latitude 36°N]], east of [[42nd meridian west|longitude 42°W]] and west of [[51st meridian east|longitude 51°E]], excluding the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]]s

The Convention prohibited the dumping of [[halocarbons]] and [[organosilicon]] (with some exceptions), [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and mercury compounds, [[cadmium]] and cadmium compounds, non-[[biodegradable]] [[plastics]] and other persistent materials, as well as "substances which have been agreed between the Contracting Parties as likely to be [[carcinogen]]ic under the conditions of disposal."&lt;ref name="ciesin1972"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sedac.ciesin.org/entri/texts/marine.pollution.dumping.ships.aircraft.1972.html |title=Convention For The Prevention Of Marine Pollution By Dumping From Ships And Aircraft |publisher=Sedac.ciesin.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also restricted and required a permit for the dumping of [[arsenic]], [[lead]], [[copper]], [[zinc]] and their compounds, as well as [[cyanide]]s, and [[fluoride]]s, [[pesticide]]s, containers, "[[tar]]-like substances", [[scrap metal]], and "other bulky wastes."&lt;ref name="ciesin1972"/&gt;

It also defined the considerations to be made in the issuance of dumping permits by each signatory state and required them to enforce the agreement within their territorial sea and make efforts to prevent dumping of materials outside the agreement's defined borders. 

The convention was amended once, in December, 1981, which amendment came into force in February, 1982.  The Oslo Convention was replaced by the [[Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic]] or "OSPAR Convention" when it came into force on March 25, 1998.

Ongoing research at the [[University of Vermont]] discovered that the pulsar was found to flip on a roughly a few hours timescale between a radio bright mode with highly organized pulsations and a quieter mode with rather chaotic temporal structure.&lt;ref name=Sciencedaily/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hermsen2013/&gt;

Moreover, the observations of the pulsar performed simultaneously with the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[XMM-Newton]] [[X-ray telescope|X-ray observatory]] and ground-based radio telescopes revealed that it exhibits variations in its X-ray emission that mimic in reverse the changes seen in radio waves—the pulsar has a weaker non-pulsing X-ray luminosity during the radio bright mode and is actually brighter during the radio quite mode emitting distinct X-ray pulses.&lt;ref name=Hermsen2013&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hermsen | first1 = W. | last2 = Hessels | first2 = J.

[[File:Formation of bogs (mesotrophic) In the climatic zone (taiga, forest-tundra) of the Arkhangelsk region. 1.jpg|thumb|300px| The development of fen (mesotrophic) swamp forests during the dry season. Summer 2018. A strong decrease of groundwater level and the feed stream. In the climatic zone (taiga, forest tundra) of the Arkhangelsk region.]]
A '''poor fen''' (also known as '''transitional bog''', '''transitional mire''' or '''sedge mire''') is a natural [[wetland]] habitat, consisting of dense low growth of small [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s and other plants.  It develops on wet ground where the water is fairly acidic and has very few [[Plant nutrition|plant nutrients]].

Poor fen is intermediate between the taller vegetation of [[fen]], which occurs where the water is much less acidic, and the short, mossy vegetation of [[bog]], which is even more acidic.

==Ecology==
Poor fen is found where the ground is permanently wet with nutrient-poor water which is somewhat acidic.  For example it occurs as the vegetation of flushes (marshy springs on slopes), in places where neutral water enters more acidic bogs, in wet acidic grassland, and sometimes in the flatter parts of [[flood-meadow]]s where much of the water is [[ombrotrophic]] (derived directly from rainfall). It sometimes forms a [[floating mat]] over water or very wet peat, making a mobile surface known as [[Bog#Quaking bog|quaking bog]].

Poor fen is usually [[grazing|grazed]] by wild animals or [[livestock]], which prevent [[ecological succession]] into wet [[woodland]].

==Vegetation==
[[File:Apis mellifera on Potentilla palustris.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The marsh cinquefoil (''[[Potentilla palustris]]'')]]

In north-western [[Europe]], characteristic plant species of poor fen communities include common sedge (''[[Carex nigra]]''), carnation sedge (''[[Carex panicea]]''), star sedge (''[[Carex echinata]]''), white beak-sedge (''[[Rhynchospora alba]]'') and many other small [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], as well as other plants such as jointed rush (''[[Juncus articulatus]]''), marsh cinquefoil (''[[Potentilla palustris]]''), bog-bean (''[[Menyanthes trifoliata]]''), bog pimpernel (''[[Anagallis tenella]]''), lesser skullcap (''[[Scutellaria minor]]'') and marsh valerian (''[[Valeriana dioica]]'').  ''[[Sphagnum]]'' mosses also occur, but are not dominant as they would be in bog vegetation.  There may also be some [[grass]]es, but these are usually inconspicuous amongst the sedges and rushes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''Self-adhesive plastic sheet''', known in the United Kingdom as '''sticky-backed plastic''', is wide [[plastic]] sheet or film with an [[adhesive]] layer on one side, used as a surface coating for decorative purposes. It is typically smooth and shiny, but can also come in textured varieties, in which case it can sometimes be used as a cheap alternative to [[wood veneer|veneer]]. The plastic is often [[PVC]]. The sheeting is typically sold with a removable paper [[release liner]] to prevent it from adhering prematurely.

Self-adhesive [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] sheet was introduced to the UK market in the 1960s under the brand name '''Fablon'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heathermacleod.co.uk/bringing-it-all-back-home-1960s-interiors-revisited/|title=Bringing it all back home – 1960′s interiors revisited|last=MacLeod|first=Heather|date=March 15, 2016|website=www.heathermacleod.co.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was extensively used in DIY at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Great Indoors: At home in the modern British house|last=Highmore|first=Ben|publisher=[[Profile Books]]|year=2014|isbn=9781847653468|location=|pages=85|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and notably featured in children's DIY projects on the British TV show ''[[Blue Peter]]'', but always under the generic name "sticky-backed plastic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/50-things-we-learned-from-blue-peter-1-1137181|title=50 things we learned from Blue Peter|last=|first=|date=16 October 2008|website=The Scotsman|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-05|quote="sticky-backed plastic" was the term used for the product marketed under the trade name Fablon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3561648/Blue-Peter-celebrating-50-years.html|title=Blue Peter: celebrating 50 years|last=Marson|first=Richard|date=4 October 2008|website=Daily Telegraph|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-09|quote=Blue Peter conjures up cosy memories of pets, badges and sticky-backed plastic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silvanus''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɪ|l|ˈ|v|eɪ|n|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/silvanus?showCookiePolicy=true|title=Silvanus or Sylvanus
|accessdate=24 September 2014|publisher=Collins Dictionary|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "of the woods" in [[Latin]]) was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[tutelary deity]] of woods and fields. As protector of the forest (''sylvestris deus''), he especially presided over plantations and delighted in trees growing wild.&lt;ref name="Tibullus"&gt;[[Tibullus]] II.5.27, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucan"&gt;[[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]]. ''[[Pharsalia]]'' III.402.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pliny"&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]]. ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis historia]]'' XII.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]]. ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' I.193.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also described as a god watching over the fields and husbandmen, protecting in particular the boundaries of fields.&lt;ref name="Epodes"&gt;[[Horace]]. ''Epodes'' II.21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The similarly named [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] deity [[Selvans]] may be a borrowing of Silvanus,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "Silvanus," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 146 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uf2_kHAs22sC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=%22borrowed+from+the+Latin%22+%22Etruscan+Selvans%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WgHcTLLtE8fOnAe5npkX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22borrowed%20from%20the%20Latin%22%20%22Etruscan%20Selvans%22&amp;f=false online], concurring with [[Dumézil]], ''Archaic Roman Religion'', p. 616.&lt;/ref&gt; or not even related in origin.&lt;ref name="selvans"&gt;Peter F. Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus: A Study in Roman Folk Religion'' (Brill, 1992), pp. 10–12 [https://books.google.com/books?id=1YzWMQecwH4C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22A+popular+theory+traces+Silvanus+back+to+the+Etruscan+divinity+Selvans%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RhfcTKbpOIrfnQfb1LUW&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20popular%20theory%20traces%20Silvanus%20back%20to%20the%20Etruscan%20divinity%20Selvans%22&amp;f=false online], noting earlier efforts to press an [[Etruscan language|Etruscan etymology]] on Silvanus.&lt;/ref&gt;

Silvanus is described as the divinity protecting the flocks of cattle, warding off wolves, and promoting their fertility.&lt;ref name="Tibullus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VirgilVIII"&gt;Virgil. ''Aeneid'' VIII.600-1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cato"&gt;[[Cato the Elder]]. ''De Re Rustica'' 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]] II.324.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dolabella]], a rural engineer of whom only a few pages are known, states that Silvanus was the first to set up stones to mark the limits of fields, and that every estate had three ''Silvani:''&lt;ref&gt;[[Dolabella]]. ''ex libris Dolabellae,'' in "Die Schriften der rômischen Feldmesser", edited by Karl Lachmann, Georg Reimer ed., Berlin, 1848, p302&lt;/ref&gt;
* a ''Silvanus domesticus'' (in inscriptions called ''Silvanus [[Lares|Larum]]'' and ''Silvanus sanctus sacer Larum'')
* a ''Silvanus agrestis'' (also called ''salutaris''), who was worshipped by shepherds, and
* a ''Silvanus orientalis'', that is, the god presiding over the point at which an estate begins.
Hence ''Silvani'' were often referred to in the plural.

==Attributes and associations==

Like other gods of woods and flocks, Silvanus is described as fond of music; the [[Pan flute|syrinx]] was sacred to him,&lt;ref name="Tibullus"/&gt; and he is mentioned along with the Pans and Nymphs.&lt;ref name="Lucan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgics"/&gt; Later speculators even identified Silvanus with [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], [[Faunus]], [[Inuus]] and [[Aegipan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]]. ''[[Parallel Lives]].'' Min. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He must have been associated with the Italian [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], for [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] refers to him as ''Mars Silvanus''.&lt;ref name="Cato"/&gt; In the provinces outside of Italy, Silvanus was identified with numerous native gods:&lt;ref&gt;Peter F.

==Worship==
[[File: Head of Silvanus crowned with pine, Centrale Montemartini, Rome (21952718528).jpg|thumb|Head of Silvanus crowned with pine, Centrale Montemartini, Rome.]]

The sacrifices offered to Silvanus consisted of grapes, ears of grain, milk, meat, wine and pigs.&lt;ref name="Tibullus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Epodes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horace. ''Epistles'' II.1.143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Juvenal"&gt;[[Juvenal]]. VI.446, with associated scholia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare Voss. ''Mythol. Briefe,'' 2.68; Hartung, ''Die Relig. der Röm.'' vol. 2. p. 170, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cato the Elder|Cato]]'s ''[[De Agricultura]]'' an offering to ''Mars Silvanus'' is described, to ensure the health of [[cow|cattle]]; it is stated there that his connection with agriculture referred to only the labour performed by men, and that females were excluded from his worship.&lt;ref name="Cato"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Juvenal"/&gt; (Compare [[Bona Dea]] for a Roman deity from whose worship men were excluded.) [[Virgil]] relates that in the very earliest times the [[Tyrrhenians|Tyrrhenian]] [[Pelasgians]] had dedicated a grove and a festival to Silvanus.&lt;ref name="VirgilVIII"/&gt;

==In literature==
In works of Latin poetry and art, Silvanus always appears as an old man, but as cheerful and in love with [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]].&lt;ref name="Epodes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]]. ''[[Georgics]]'' II.494&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carmina"&gt;Horace. ''[[Odes (Horace)|Carmina]]'' III.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. ''Metamorphoses'' XIV.639.&lt;/ref&gt; Virgil represents him as carrying the trunk of a [[Cupressus sempervirens|cypress]] ({{lang-el|δενδροφόρος}}),&lt;ref name="Georgics"&gt;Virgil. ''Georgics'' I.20-1.&lt;/ref&gt; about which the following myth is told. Silvanus – or [[Apollo]] according to other versions&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius]]. ''Commentary on the Aeneid'' III.680.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. ''Metamorphoses'' X.106&lt;/ref&gt; – was in love with [[Cyparissus]], and once by accident killed a pet hind belonging to Cyparissus. The latter died of grief, and was metamorphosed into a cypress.&lt;ref&gt;Servius. ''Commentary on Virgil's Georgics'' I.20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Virgil. ''[[Eclogues]]'' X.26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Virgil. ''[[Aeneid]]'' III.680.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Edmund Spenser]]'s epic poem ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' (1590–96), Silvanus appears in Canto VI of Book I. His 'wyld woodgods' (Stanza 9) save the lost and frightened Lady Una from being molested by ''Sans loy'' and take her to him. They treat her as a Queen because of her great beauty. Spenser writes in Stanza 14:

:::So towards old ''Syluanus'' they did her bring;
:::Who with the noyse awaked, commeth out,
:::To weet the cause, his weake steps gouerning,
:::And aged limbs on Cypresse stadle stout,
:::And with an yvie twyne his wast is girt gud about.

'''Soil zoology''' is the study of animals living fully or partially in the [[soil]] ([[soil fauna]]). The term was apparently first used for a conference of soil zoologists presenting their research at the [[University of Nottingham]], UK, in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Soil Zoology. Proceedings of the University of Nottingham, Second Easter School in Agricultural Science, 1955. by D. [[Keith McE. Kevan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tamanowas Rock''' (also spelled Tamanous&lt;ref name=PTLeader2009/&gt;), also called '''Chimacum Rock''', is a {{convert|150|ft|adj=on}}&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Middleton/&gt;{{rp|169}} high rock with caves and crevices that lies in a forest adjacent to [[Anderson Lake State Park]], near [[Port Townsend, Washington]]. It is a sacred site to the [[Coast Salish peoples]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and a pilgrimage site.&lt;ref name=Jamestown_Tribe/&gt; The rock was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="WkList"&gt;{{citation | last = National Park Service | authorlink = National Park Service | title = Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 8/03/15 through 8/07/15 | date = August 14, 2015 | url = http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20150814.htm | accessdate = August 14, 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Tamanowas Rock is said to have first been used 10,000 years ago by the [[Chimakum]] (or Chemacum) people (who no longer exist), leading to its alternate name "Chimacum Rock", whose name is also found in other local geographic features.&lt;ref name=JLT/&gt; In accordance with legend, it may have been used as a refuge from the tsunami caused by the [[1700 Cascadia earthquake]], and earlier as a lookout for hunting now-extinct [[mastodon]].&lt;ref name=McShane2013/&gt; "Tamanowas" means "[[Nature religion|spirit power]]" in the [[Klallam language]].&lt;ref name=PDN2013/&gt;

==Preservation==
The site is either a registered archaeological site, or nominated to become one with the Washington State Department of Archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://dahp.wa.gov/washington-state-advisory-council-on-historic-preservation|title=Washington State Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's nominations|publisher=Washington State Department of Archaeology|accessdate=2015-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623025507/http://dahp.wa.gov/washington-state-advisory-council-on-historic-preservation#|archive-date=2015-06-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the rock was purchased with {{convert|62|acres}} of surrounding land by the [[Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe]] for preservation, at the end of a series of loans and purchases by organizations including [[Washington State Parks]], [[Bullitt Foundation]] and Jefferson Land Trust, that started in 2009.&lt;ref name=PTLeader2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Middleton/&gt; The land was added to an existing 22-acre purchase by the tribe. Prior to this, it was a rock climbing site,&lt;ref name=PDN2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=McShane/&gt; a practice which was ended when the S'Klallam Tribe took ownership.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jamestown_Tribe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blumhagen/&gt;&lt;ref name=PDN2013/&gt;

===Desecration===
In 2014, the rock was desecrated with graffiti, gaining national and international attention.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Daily_Mail/&gt;&lt;ref name=SkyNews/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZeeNews/&gt;&lt;ref name=NZHerald/&gt;&lt;ref name=PDN2014/&gt;

==Geology==
[[File:Continental Arc Sketch.jpg|thumb|Formation of [[Volcanic arc|magmatic arc]] in a subduction zone]]
The mineral composition is Eocene [[subaerial]] [[Adakite|adakitic lava]] and lava [[breccia]].&lt;ref name=Tucker/&gt; Dikes of similar composition exist in the [[Blue Hills (Washington)|Blue Hills]] near Bremerton 60&amp;nbsp;km away, both thought to be created by subduction of the [[Kula-Farallon Ridge]] beneath North America. They may be related by being part of a [[Volcanic arc|magmatic arc]] &lt;!-- source says "magmatic belt"--&gt;, they may be two isolated volcanic centers, or they may have been created at a single center and displaced along a fault (see [[Puget Sound faults]]).&lt;!-- sources say "Bremerton fault" -- is this Seattle Fault?--&gt;&lt;ref name=Hahn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tepper/&gt;

[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|frameless|300px|right]]

'''''The Blue Marble''''' is an image of planet [[Earth]] taken on December 7, 1972, by the crew of the [[Apollo 17]] spacecraft at a distance of about {{convert|29000|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=off}} from the surface.&lt;ref name=29000km&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/AS17_PAO.PDF | title=Apollo 17 PAO Mission Commentary Transcript | publisher=[[NASA]] | date=2001 | accessdate=May 11, 2017 | page=106 | quote='''SC''': You're loud and clear, Bob, and could you give us our distance from the Earth? ...

The image has the official NASA designation '''AS17-148-22727'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/apollo/apollo17/html/as17-148-22727.html | title=Apollo Imagery | publisher=[[NASA]] | date=November 1, 2012 | accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shows the Earth from the point of view of the Apollo crew travelling towards the moon. The translunar coast photograph extends from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to [[Antarctica]]. This was the first time the Apollo trajectory made it possible to photograph the south [[polar ice cap]], despite the [[Southern Hemisphere]] being heavily covered in clouds. In addition to the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[Madagascar]], almost the entire coastline of [[Africa]] is clearly visible. The Asian mainland is on the horizon.

The name has also been applied by NASA to a 2012 series of image data sets covering the entire globe at relatively high resolution, created by carefully sifting through satellite-captured sequences taken over time, to eliminate as much cloud cover as possible from the collated set of images.

== The photograph ==

The photograph, taken by astronauts on December 7, 1972, at 05:39&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time Zone|EST]] (10:39 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), is one of the most widely distributed photographic images in existence.&lt;ref name="NASAmarble" /&gt; The image is one of the few to show an almost fully illuminated Earth as the astronauts had the Sun behind them when they took the image. To the [[astronaut]]s, the slightly [[gibbous]] Earth had the appearance and size of a glass [[marble (toy)|marble]], hence the name. It has been mostly shown with Antarctica at the bottom, although the actual view the astronauts had was with Antarctica on top.

=== History ===
[[File:Apollo17WorldReversed.jpg|thumb|right|The photograph shown above is as the camera saw it; the line from the top to the bottom of the camera ran from the south to the north of the Earth. &lt;ref name="TheAtlant"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reinert |first1=Al |title=The Blue Marble Shot: Our First Complete Photograph of Earth |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/04/the-blue-marble-shot-our-first-complete-photograph-of-earth/237167/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=1 August 2018 |date=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The photograph was taken about 5 hours and 6 minutes after launch of the Apollo 17 mission,&lt;ref name="TheAtlant"/&gt; and about 1 hour 54 minutes after the spacecraft left its parking orbit around Earth, to begin its trajectory to the [[Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/images17.html#MagNN |title=Apollo 17 Image Library |work=Apollo 17 Multimedia |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time of Apollo 17's launch, 12:33&amp;nbsp;a.m. EST, meant that Africa was in daylight during the early hours of the spacecraft's flight. With the December [[solstice]] approaching, Antarctica was also illuminated.

The [[1972 Tamil Nadu cyclone]] can be seen in the top right of the image. This storm had brought flooding and high winds to the [[India]]n state of [[Tamil Nadu]] on December 5, two days before the photograph was taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/static/cyclone-history-bb.htm | title = History of Past Cyclones | publisher = [[Indian Meteorological Department]] | accessdate = September 16, 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140925101914/http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/static/cyclone-history-bb.htm | archivedate = September 25, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photograph's official NASA designation is AS17-148-22727. NASA photograph AS17-148-22726, taken just before and nearly identical to 22727, is also used as a full-Earth image.&lt;ref name="TheAtlant"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = Geek Trivia | title = Worth a thousand worlds | publisher = TechRepublic | date = December 6, 2005 | accessdate = June 23, 2007 | url = http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10881_11-5983104.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413041652/http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10881_11-5983104.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = April 13, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photographer used a 70-millimeter [[Hasselblad]] camera with an 80-millimeter [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] lens.&lt;ref&gt;https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-hass.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = NASA Mapping Sciences Branch | title = Apollo 17 Index: 70 mm, 35 mm, and 16 mm Photographs | date = May 1974 | pages = 88. [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a17/a17.photidx.pdf PDF]}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA credits the image to the entire Apollo 17 crew{{mdash}}[[Eugene Cernan]], [[Ronald Evans (astronaut)|Ronald Evans]] and [[Harrison Schmitt|Jack Schmitt]]{{mdash}}all of whom took photographs during the mission with the on-board Hasselblad, although evidence examined after the mission suggests that Jack Schmitt was the photographer.&lt;ref name="NASAmarble"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehartwell.com/Apollo17/ |title=Apollo 17: The Blue Marble |date=April 25, 2007 |publisher=ehartwell.com |accessdate=January 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109151245/http://www.ehartwell.com/Apollo17/ |archivedate=January 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

All Apollo flights were heavily scheduled down to the minute. At the time this photo was taken, none of the astronauts was scheduled to do so. Thus this photo was taken quickly in a stolen moment. The astronaut who took the picture was weightless, and the continents were hard to see, and he took the photo quickly, which explains why he held the camera upside down compared to the north up orientation of all maps. If every photo on this roll of film is printed, and all of the photos on the roll of film are oriented the same way, then when viewed in sequence, to put feet down and heads up, this photo will have the south pole up, breaking the map convention.&lt;ref name="TheAtlant"/&gt;

Apollo 17 was the last manned lunar mission. No human since has been far enough from Earth to photograph a whole-Earth image&lt;ref name="Petsko" /&gt; such as ''The Blue Marble'', but whole-Earth images have been taken by many unmanned spacecraft missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/topics/apollo/apollo-program/landing-missions/apollo17.cfm |title=Apollo 17 (AS-512) The Last Manned Lunar Landing |accessdate=Jan 30, 2018 |work=National Air and Space Museum - Smithsonian Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

''The Blue Marble'' was not the first clear image taken of an illuminated face of Earth, since similar shots from the [[ATS-3]] satellite had already been made as early as 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.ssec.wisc.edu/spinscan/search.php?txtLocalDay1=&amp;txtLocalDay2=&amp;op1=AND&amp;selMeanTimeBound=none&amp;txtMeanTime=&amp;op2=AND&amp;selQuality=%25good+whole+earth%25&amp;op3=AND&amp;numOfRecs=48&amp;ordering=time_asc&amp;submit=Search&amp;listing=slides |title=ATS-III Image Collection – Images of the Earth taken from November 1967 till March 1969 |work=Schwerdtfeger Library – [[ATS-3|ATS-III]] |accessdate=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apollo 17 image, however, released during a surge in [[environmentalism|environmental activism]] during the 1970s, became a symbol of the environmental movement, as a depiction of Earth's frailty, vulnerability, and isolation amid the vast expanse of space.&lt;ref name="Petsko" /&gt; NASA archivist Mike Gentry has speculated that ''The Blue Marble'' is among the most widely distributed images in human history.&lt;ref name="NASAmarble" /&gt;

== Subsequent ''Blue Marble'' images ==
Subsequent similar images of Earth (including composites at much higher resolution) have also been termed ''Blue Marble'' images, and the phrase "blue marble" (as well as the picture itself) is frequently used, as in the [[Flag of the Earth|Earth flag]] by environmental activist organizations or companies attempting to promote an environmentally conscious image. There has also been a children's [[television program]] called ''[[Big Blue Marble]]''. Poet-diplomat [[Abhay K]] has penned an [[Earth Anthem]] inspired by the blue marble which contains "all the peoples and the nations of the world, one for all, all for one, united we unfurl the blue marble flag".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2013/05/24/onsaturday/voices/249135.html An Anthem for the Earth] ''The Kathmandu Post'', May 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=while plausible statements in this paragraph are not substantiated|date=August 2015}}

}}

In 2002, NASA released an extensive set of satellite-captured imagery, including prepared images suitable for direct human viewing, as well as complete sets suitable for use in preparing further works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/BlueMarble/BlueMarble_2002.html |title=Blue Marble : Feature Articles |publisher=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov |date=October 13, 2005 |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, 1&amp;nbsp;km/pixel was the most detailed imagery available for free, and permitted for reuse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christoph Hormann|url=http://www.imagico.de/pov/earth1.html |title=Christoph's page&amp;nbsp;— Earth&amp;nbsp;— early renders |publisher=Imagico.de |date=May 30, 2007 |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; without a need for extensive preparatory work to eliminate cloud cover and conceal missing data, or to parse specialized data formats. The data also included a similarly manually assembled cloud-cover and night-lights image sets, at lower resolutions.

A subsequent release was made in 2005, named ''Blue Marble Next Generation''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluemarble.ch/bluemarble/Projects/Entries/2005/1/1_Blue_Marble_Next_Generation.html ''Blue Marble'' Next Generation Project]&lt;/ref&gt; This series of photo mosaics was produced with the aid of automated image-sifting upon images from [[NASA Earth Observatory|NASA's Earth Observatory]], which enabled the inclusion of a complete, cloud-free globe for each month from January to December 2004, at even higher resolution (500&amp;nbsp;m/pixel).&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BlueMarble/ ''Blue Marble'' Next Generation at NASA's Earth Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt; The original release of a single-image set covering the entire globe could not reflect the extent of seasonal snow-and-vegetative cover across both hemispheres, but this newer release closely modeled the changes of the seasons.

A number of interactive viewers for these data have also been released, among them a [[music visualization]] for the [[PlayStation 3|PS3]] that is based on the texture data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16748 Gamasutra – Special: Q-Games On PS3's 'Gaia' Music Visualizer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/BlueMarble/ Blue Marble Next Generation : Feature Articles on Earthobservatory.nasa.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: North_America_from_low_orbiting_satellite_Suomi_NPP.jpg |thumb|''Blue Marble 2012'' – a composite satellite image]]
On January 25, 2012, [[NASA]] released a composite image of the [[western hemisphere]] of Earth entitled ''Blue Marble 2012''.

This projection results in a very wide-angle presentation such as one might get with a fish-eye lens, and it does not include the whole hemisphere.

The nighttime views were obtained with the new satellite's "day-night band" of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared, and uses filtering techniques to observe dim signals such as city lights, gas flares, auroras, wildfires, and reflected moonlight. Auroras, fires, and other stray light have been removed in the case of the ''Black Marble'' images to emphasize the city lights.&lt;ref name="NASAFlick20121209" /&gt; The images have been used to study the spatial distribution of economic activity, to select sites for astronomical observatories, and to monitor human activities around protected areas.&lt;ref name="NASAFlick20121209" /&gt;

The Western United States, [[Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean]] are visible, but much of South America is hidden beneath cloud cover. [[Greenland]] can be seen at the upper edge of the image.

The EPIC science team plans to upload 13 new color images per day on their website. The color balance has been adjusted to approximate an image that could be seen with the average human eye. In addition to images, scientific information will be uploaded as it becomes available after in-flight calibration is complete. The science information will be ozone and aerosol amounts, cloud reflectivity, cloud height, and vegetation information.  The EPIC instrument views the Earth from sunrise in the west to sunset in the east 12 to 13 times per day as the Earth rotates at 15 degrees of longitude per hour. Clearly visible are storms forming over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, major slowly moving "cloud rivers", dust aerosol plumes from Africa, the sun's reflection in the oceans, ship exhaust tracks in the clouds, rivers and lakes, and the variegated land surface patterns especially in the African deserts. The spatial resolution of the color images is about 10&amp;nbsp;km, and the resolution of the science products will be about 20&amp;nbsp;km. Once every three months, lunar images are obtained that are the same as those viewed from Earth during our full Moon. On occasion, the other side of the Moon will appear in the Earth images as the Moon crosses in front of the Earth.

The '''tidewater glacier cycle''' is the typically centuries-long behavior of [[glacier|tidewater glaciers]] that consists of recurring periods of advance alternating with rapid retreat and punctuated by periods of stability. During portions of its cycle, a tidewater glacier is relatively insensitive to [[climate change]].

==Calving rate of tidewater glaciers==
[[File:Icebergs cape york 4.jpg|right|thumb|270px|Iceberg [[Ice calving|calving]] from several tidewater glaciers, [[Cape York (Greenland)|Cape York]], [[Greenland]]]]
While climate is the main factor affecting the behavior of all glaciers, additional factors affect calving ([[iceberg]]-producing) tidewater glaciers. These glaciers terminate abruptly at the ocean interface,  with large pieces of the glacier fracturing and separating, or [[Ice calving|calving]], from the ice front as icebergs.

Climate change causes a shift in the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of a glacier. This is the imaginary line on a glacier, above which snow accumulates faster than it ablates, and below which, the reverse is the case. This altitude shift, in turn, prompts a retreat or advance of the terminus toward a new steady-state position. However, this change in terminus behavior for calving glaciers is also a function of resulting changes in [[fjord]] geometry, and calving rate at the glacier terminus as it changes position.&lt;ref name="Mercer"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Mercer| first = J.H.| author-link = | title = The response of fjord glaciers to changes in the firn limit| journal = Journal of Glaciology| volume = 3/29| pages = 850–858| year = 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Post1"&gt;{{Cite journal| first =Post| last =Austen| title =Preliminary hydrography and historical terminal changes of Columbia Glacier| year =1975| publisher =U.S. Geological Survey Hydrologic Investigations Atlas HA-559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calving glaciers are different from land terminating glaciers in the variation in velocity along their length.  Land terminating glacier velocities decline as the terminus is approached.  Calving glaciers accelerate at the terminus.   A declining velocity near the terminus slows the glacier response to climate.  An accelerating velocity at the front enhances the speed of the glaciers response to climate or glacier dynamic changes.  This is observed in [[Svalbard]], [[Patagonia]] and [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name="Vieli"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Van"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren1"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Warren| first =C.R. |author2=N.F.

Rivera| title =Characteristics of tidewater calving activity at Glaciar San Rafael, Chile| journal =Journal of Glaciology| volume =41| issue =138| pages =273–289| year =1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; A calving glacier requires more accumulation area than a land terminating glacier to offset this higher loss from calving.

The calving rate is largely controlled by the depth of the water and the glacier velocity at the calving front. The process of calving provides an imbalance in forces at the front of the glaciers, that raises velocity.&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Hughes| first =Terence| title =Calving ice walls| journal =Annals of Glaciology| volume =12| issue =| pages =74–80| year =1988| url =| doi =| id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The depth of the water at the glacier front is a simple measure that allows estimation of calving rate, but is the amount of flotation of the glacier at the front that is the specific physical characteristic that is important.&lt;ref name="Vieli"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Vieli| first =A. |author2=J.

Water depth at the glacier terminus is the key variable in predicting calving of a tidewater glacier.&lt;ref name="Brown1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brown | first =C.S. |author2=M.F.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect contributes to the insensitivity of a glacier to climate when its terminus is either retreating or advancing in deep water.

Austin Post was one of the first to propose that water depth at the calving margin strongly affects the rate of iceberg calving.&lt;ref name="Post1"/&gt;  Glaciers that terminate on a [[moraine|morainal]] shoal are generally stable, but once a glacier retreats into water that deepens as the ice front recedes, calving rate increases rapidly and results in drastic retreat of the terminus.  Using data collected from 13 Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers, Brown et al. (1982) derived the following relationship between calving speed and water depth: &lt;math&gt;V_C = CH_w + D&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;V_C&lt;/math&gt; is the mean calving speed ([[metre|m]]⋅[[Annum|a]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a calving coefficient (27.1±2&amp;nbsp;a&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), &lt;math&gt;H_w&lt;/math&gt; is the mean water depth at glacier front (m) and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a constant (0&amp;nbsp;m⋅a&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).  Pelto and Warren (1991) found a similar calving relationship with tidewater glaciers observed over longer time periods, with slightly reduced calving rate to the mainly summer rates noted by Brown et al. (1982).&lt;ref name="Brown1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PeltoWarren1991"/&gt;

Calving is an important form of ablation for glaciers that terminate in [[Fresh water|freshwater]], also.  Funk and Röthlisberger determined a relationship between calving speed and water depth based on analysis of six glaciers that calve into lakes.&lt;ref name="Funk1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Funk | first =M. |author2=Röthlisberger, F. | title =Forecasting the effects of a planned reservoir which will partially flood the tongue of Unteraargletscher in Switzerland | journal =Annals of Glaciology | volume =13 | pages =76–81 | publisher =[[International Glaciological Society]] | year =1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They found that the same basic calving relationship developed for tidewater calving glaciers was true for freshwater calving glaciers, only the calving coefficients lead to calving rates 10% of that for tidewater glaciers.

==Tidewater glacier phases==
Observations of Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers prompted Austin Post&lt;ref name="Post1"/&gt; to describe the tidewater calving glacier advance/retreat cycle:  (1) advancing, (2) stable-extended, (3) drastically retreating, or (4) stable-retracted.  The following is a detailed review of the tidewater glacier cycle derived by Post, with numerous cited examples, the cycle is based on observations of temperate tidewater glaciers in Alaska, not outlet glaciers from large ice sheets or polar glaciers.

The ''accumulation area ratio'' of a glacier, AAR, is the percentage of a glacier that is a snow-covered accumulation zone at the end of the summer melt season.  This percentage for large Alaskan glaciers is between 60 and 70 for non-calving glaciers, 70-80 for moderately calving glaciers and up to 90 for very high calving rate glaciers.&lt;ref name="Pelto2"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Pelto| first =M.S.| title =Mass balance of southeast Alaska and northwest British Columbia glaciers from 1976 to 1984: Methods and Results| journal =Annals of Glaciology| volume =9| issue =| pages =189–193| year =1987| url=http://crevassezone.org/reports/JIRP/37-Balance76-84.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; By using accumulation area ratio (AAR) data for Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers, Pelto (1987)&lt;ref name="Pelto2"/&gt; and Viens (1995)&lt;ref name="Viens1"&gt;{{Cite journal| first =R.J.| last =Viens| title =Dynamics and mass balance of tidewater calving glaciers of southern Alaska (Unpublished Masters thesis)| year =1995| pages =| place =University of Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced models showing that climate acts as a first-order control on the advance/retreat cycle of calving glaciers during most of the advance retreat cycle, but there are climate insensitive periods as well.  Pelto (1987) examined the terminus behavior of 90 Alaskan glaciers and found that the terminus behavior of all 90 were correctly predicted based on the AAR and calving rate.&lt;ref name="Pelto2"/&gt;

===Advancing===
[[File:Hub Glacier.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The Hubbard Glacier]]
If we begin at the stable retracted position at the end of a tidewater glacier cycle the glacier will have a moderate calving rate and a high AAR, above 70.  The glacier will build a terminus [[shoal]] of [[sediment]] further reducing the calving rate.  This will improve the [[glacier mass balance]] and the glacier can begin to advance due to this change or an increase in ice flux to the terminus due to increasing snowfall or reduced snow melt.  As the advance proceeds the terminus shoal will be pushed in front of the glacier and continue to build, keeping the calving rate low.  In the case of the most glaciers such as the [[Taku Glacier]] the glacier will eventually build a terminus shoal that is above water and calving will essentially cease. This will eliminate this loss of ice from the glacier and the glacier can continue to advance. Taku Glacier and [[Hubbard Glacier]] have been in this phase of the cycle. Taku Glacier which has been advancing for 120 years no longer calves. Hubbard Glacier still has a calving front.&lt;ref name="Pelto3"&gt;{{cite web| last =Pelto| first =Mauri S. |author2=Matt Beedle |author3=Maynard M. Miller| title =Mass Balance Measurements of the Taku Glacier, Juneau Icefield, Alaska, 1946-2005| publisher =Juneau Icefield Research Program| year =2005| url =http://www.nichols.edu/departments/Glacier/taku.html| accessdate = 2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{cite web| title =Program Overview/Why Study Hubbard Glacier?| work =Hubbard Glacier, Alaska| publisher =U.S. Geological Survey| date =January 3, 2007| url =http://ak.water.usgs.gov/glaciology/hubbard/index.htm| accessdate = 2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The glacier will then expand until the AAR is between 60 and 70 and equilibrium of the non-calving glacier is achieved.  The glacier is not very sensitive to climate during the advance as its AAR is quite high, when the terminus shoal is limiting calving.

===Stable-extended===
At the maximum extended position the glacier is once again sensitive to changing climate.&lt;ref name="Viens1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pelto4"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Pelto| first =M.|author2=M.M. Miller | title =Mass Balance of the Taku Glacier, Alaska from 1946 to 1986| journal =Northwest Science| volume =64| issue =3| pages =121–130| year =1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brady Glacier]] and [[Baird Glacier]] are examples of glaciers currently at this point. Brady Glacier has been thinning during the last two decades due to the higher equilibrium line altitudes accompanying warmer conditions in the region, and its secondary termini have begun to retreat.  A glacier can remain at this position for sometime, a century at least in the case of Brady Glacier.  Usually substantial thinning occurs before retreat from the shoal commences.  This allowed the prediction in 1980, by the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS), of the retreat of the [[Columbia Glacier (Alaska)|Columbia Glacier]] from its terminus shoal.&lt;ref name="Meier"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meier|first=M.F|author2=A. Post |author3=L. A. Rasmussen |author4=W. G. Sikonia |author5=L. R. Mayo |title=Retreat of Columbia Glacier, Alaska - A preliminary prediction|publisher=USGS Open-File Report|volume = 80-10|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The glacier had remained on this shoal throughout the entire 20th century. The USGS was monitoring the glacier due to its proximity to [[Valdez, Alaska]], the port for crude oil export from the [[Alaskan Pipeline]].  At some point a decline in mass balance will trigger a retreat from the shoal into deeper water at which point calving will ensue.&lt;ref name="Post1"/&gt; Based on the recent thinning it is suggested that Brady Glacier is poised to begin retreat.

===Drastically retreating===
[[File:ColumbiaGlacierJune2004.JPG|thumb|right|270px|Columbia Glacier in 2004]]
The calving rate will increase as the glacier retreats from the shoal into the deeper fjord just cleared by the glacier during advance.   The water depth initially increases as the glacier retreats from the shoal, causing every more rapid glacier flow, calving and retreat.  A glacier is comparatively insensitive to climate during this calving retreat.  However, in the case of [[San Rafael Glacier]], [[Chile]], a switch from retreat  (1945–1990) to advance (1990–1997) was noted.&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Warren| first =C. R.| title =Rapid recent fluctuations of the calving San Rafael Glacier, Chilean Patagonia: Climatic or non-climatic?| journal =Geografiska Annaler| volume =75A| issue =3| pages =111–125| year =1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current examples of this retreat are Columbia Glacier and [[Guyot Glacier]].  The most famous recent example of this is the large retreat of Glacier Bay and Icy Bay glaciers in Alaska that occurred rapidly via this process.&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite conference| first =R. D.| last =Powell| title =Grounding-line systems as second-order controls on fluctuations of tidewater termini of temperate glaciers| booktitle =Glacial marine sedimentation: Paleoclimate significance; Special Paper 261 | editor = J.

[[Muir Glacier]] retreated 33&amp;nbsp;[[Kilometre|km]] from 1886 to 1968 featuring extensive calving the entire time.  It reversed its retreat briefly 1890&amp;mdash;1892.&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite book | last =Field  | first =W. O.  | authorlink = |editor= W. O.

The retreat continued an additional 6.5&amp;nbsp;km by 2001.&lt;ref name="Molnia2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Molnia | first =B.F. | title =Late nineteenth to early twenty-first century behavior of Alaskan glaciers as indicators of changing regional climate | journal =Global and Planetary Change | volume =56 | pages =23 | publisher =Elsevier B.V. | year =2006 | asin = B000PDTHNS | doi =10.1016/j.gloplacha.2006.07.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the glacier is near the head of its fjord and with minimal calving the glacier may be stable at this retracted position.

The best current example is illustrated by the [[United States Geological Survey]] study of Columbia Glacier.  They noted that the average calving rate from Columbia Glacier increased from 3&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;⋅a&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in the second half of 1983 to 4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;⋅a&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; during the first nine months of 1984. This rate was four times greater than that measured at the end of 1977 and increased again in 1985. The glacier flow, i.e., the movement of the ice toward the sea, also increased, it was inadequate to keep pace with the break-up and expulsion of icebergs.  The increase in speed instead seemed to just feed the ever faster conveyor to the terminus for iceberg production. This prompted the USGS to predict that the glacier would retreat 32&amp;nbsp;km before stabilizing.&lt;ref name="Meier"/&gt;  By 2006, it has retreated 16&amp;nbsp;km. The water remains deep and the calving rate and glacier velocity very high, indicating retreat will continue. At this point, just like having a balloon payment in an adjustable rate mortgage, the glacier has to pay a whole new portion of its balance via icebergs.  The glacier accelerates as flow is enhanced by the calving process; this increases the export of icebergs from the glacier.  Large calving retreats are initiated by warming conditions causing ice thinning.  The resulting retreat to a new equilibrium conditions can be far more extensive than will be regained during the next advance stage. A good example of this is Muir Glacier.

Next to Glacier Bay, Icy Bay has had the most extensive retreat. At the beginning of the 20th century, the coastline was nearly straight and the bay non-existent.  The entrance of the bay was filled by a tidewater glacier face that calved icebergs directly into the Gulf of Alaska.  A century later glacier retreat has opened a multi-armed bay more than 30 miles long.  The tidewater glacier has divided into three independent glaciers, Yahtse, Tsaa and Guyot Glacier. Other examples of glaciers currently in the retreat phase are South Sawyer and Sawyer Glaciers in Alaska, retreating 2.1 and 2.3&amp;nbsp;km respectively from 1961 to 2005.

In Patagonia an example of a rapidly retreating glacier is the Jorge Montt Glacier which drains into Baja Jorge Montt in the Pacific Ocean. The glacier’s ice thinning, at low elevations, from 1975 to 2000 reached 18&amp;nbsp;m⋅a&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at the lowest elevations. The glacier calving front experienced a major retreat of 8.5&amp;nbsp;km in those 25 years as a result of rapid thinning [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=16337].

===Stable-retracted===
At some point the glacier reaches a pinning point where calving is reduced due to a fjord narrowing or shoaling and the glacier’s AAR is near 100.  This is occurring with [[LeConte Glacier]] and [[Yathse Glacier]].  Le Conte Glacier currently has an AAR of 90, is at a retracted position and seems likely to be set to advance after building a terminus shoal.&lt;ref name="Motyka2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Motyka |first=RJ |author2=L Hunter |author3=K Echelmeyer |author4=C Connor |title=Submarine melting at the terminus of a temperate tidewater glacier, LeConte Glacier, Alaska |journal=Annals of Glaciology |volume=36 |publisher=International Glaciological Society |year=2003 |url=http://www.uas.alaska.edu/envs/publications/pubs/Motyka_et_al.pdf |accessdate=2007-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708202455/http://www.uas.alaska.edu/envs/publications/pubs/Motyka_et_al.pdf |archivedate=July 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drop in calving rate allows the glacier to reestablish equilibrium.

==Examples of tidewater glacier behavior==
===Taku Glacier===
The Taku Glacier provides a good example of this cycle.  It was at its maximum extent near 1750.  At this point it had closed off [[Taku Inlet]].&lt;ref name="Motyka1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Motyka | first =R. J. |author2=Beget, J. E.   | title =Taku Glacier, southeast Alaska, U.S.A.: Late Holocene history of a tide-water glacier | journal =Arctic and Alpine Research | volume =28 | pages =42–51 | publisher = | year =1996  | doi =10.2307/1552084 | issue =1 | jstor =1552084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, calving retreat commenced. By the time [[John Muir]] saw the glacier in 1890, it was near its minimum extent, at a location where the fjord narrowed, with deep water in front.&lt;ref name="Muir1915"&gt;{{cite book | last =Muir | first =John | title =Travels in Alaska | publisher =Houghton Mifflin | year =1915 | location =Boston | url =http://www.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/writings/travels_in_alaska/ | isbn = 0-87156-783-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 1900,  its AAR of 90 led to the Taku Glacier onset of advance, at the same time that the remaining [[Juneau Icefield]] glaciers continued receding.&lt;ref name="Pelto4"/&gt;  This advance continued at a rate of 88&amp;nbsp;m⋅a&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, advancing&amp;nbsp;5.3&amp;nbsp;km from the 1900 minimum until 1948, all the while building and then riding up on a substantial [[outwash plain]] beneath its calving face.  After 1948, the now non-calving Taku Glacier, possessed an AAR only slightly reduced (86 and 63). This drove 1.5&amp;nbsp;km of further advance at a reduced rate of 37&amp;nbsp;m⋅a&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  In 1990, the Taku Glacier’s AAR was 82 high enough, to prompt Pelto and Miller to conclude that the Taku Glacier would continue to advance for the remaining decade of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Pelto4"/&gt; From 1986 to 2005, the equilibrium line altitude on the glacier rose without a significant terminus shift causing the AAR to decline to about 72.  Pelto and Miller concluded that the current reduction in rate of advance is since 1970 is attributable to the laterally expanding terminal lobe as opposed to declining mass balance and that the primary force behind the Taku Glacier’s advance since about 1900 is due to positive mass balance.&lt;ref name="Pelto4"/&gt;  The recent lack of positive mass balance will eventually slow the retreat if it persists.

==Effects of climate change==
The size of tidewater glaciers is such that the tidewater glacier cycle is several hundred years in length. A tidewater glacier is not sensitive to climate during the advancing and drastically retreating phases of its cycle.  In the same region, disparate terminus responses are observed amongst tidewater calving glaciers, but not land terminating glaciers.  This is exemplified by the 17 major glaciers of the [[Juneau Icefield]], 5 have retreated more than 500 m since 1948, 11 more than 1000 m, and one glacier the Taku has advanced.  This difference highlights the unique impacts on terminus behavior of the tidewater glacier cycle, which has caused the Taku Glacier to be insensitive to climate change in the last 60 years.
Concurrently, in both Patagonia&lt;ref name="Warren"/&gt; and Alaska,&lt;ref name="Brown1982"/&gt; there are tidewater glaciers that have advanced for a considerable period, tidewater glaciers undergoing rapid retreat and stable tidewater glaciers.

To calculate simple WUE, a data center manager divides the annual site water usage in liters by the IT equipment energy usage in kilowatt hours (Kwh). Water usage includes water used for cooling, regulating humidity and producing electricity on-site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/definition/WUE-water-usage-effectiveness searchdatacenter.techtarget.com, Data center energy efficiency, retrieved 16 Sep 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;  More complex WUE calculations are available from [[The Green Grid]] website.
