[[File:Alma Mater Restored 2014.jpg|thumb|372x372px|The [[Latin]] [[noun]] ''alumnus'' means “foster son” or “pupil” and is derived from the [[verb]] ''alere'' "to nourish". ''Pictured'': [[Lorado Taft]]'s [[Alma Mater (Illinois sculpture)|''Alma Mater'']] in Illinois. ]]
An '''alumnus''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|l|ʌ|m|n|ə|s}} (masculine), an '''alumna''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|l|ʌ|m|n|ə}} (feminine), or an '''alumnum''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|l|ʌ|m|n|ə|m}} (gender-neutral) of a college, university, or other school is a former student who has either attended or graduated in some fashion from the institution. The word is Latin and simply means ''student''. The plural is ''alumni'' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|l|ʌ|m|n|aɪ}}) for men and mixed groups and ''alumnae'' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|l|ʌ|m|n|iː}}) for women. The term is not synonymous with "graduate"; one can be an alumnus without graduating. ([[Burt Reynolds]], alumnus but not graduate of [[Florida State University|Florida State]], is an example.) An alumnus can also be and is more recently expanded to include a former employee of an organization&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://enterprisealumni.com/2017-corporate-alumni-survey/|title=The State Of Corporate Alumni : 2017 Survey Results|date=2017-10-02|work=EnterpriseAlumni - Large Organization Alumni &amp; Retiree Management|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it may also apply to a former member, contributor, or inmate.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alumni|quote=1: A person who has attended or has graduated from a particular school, college, or university. 2: a person who is a former member, employee, contributor, or inmate |title=Alumni – Definition from the Free Merriam Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="macmill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/alumnus |title=Alumnus – definition of alumnus by Macmillan dictionary |publisher=Macmillandictionary.com |quote=Someone who was a student at a particular school, college, or university |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Latin]] [[noun]] ''alumnus'' means “foster son” or “pupil” and is derived from the [[verb]] ''alere'' "to nourish".&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alumnus Merriam-Webster: alumnus]...&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''alumnus'' appears in [[Roman law]] to describe a child placed in [[fosterage]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]]'' 40, 2, 14&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Boswell]], the word "is nowhere defined in relation to status, privilege, or obligation."{{sfn|Boswell|1988|pp=116}} Citing the research of [[John Boswell]], who studied the many inscriptions about ''alumni,'' Boswell concluded that it referred to [[infant exposure|exposed children]] who were taken into a household where they were "regarded as somewhere between an heir and a slave, partaking in different ways of both categories." Despite the warmth of feelings between the parent and child, "an ''alumnus'' might be treated both as a beloved child and as a household servant."{{sfn|Boswell|1988|pp=117–119}}

==Usage==
An alumnus, alumna, or alumnum is a former student and most often a graduate of an educational institution (school, college, university).&lt;ref name="American Heritage Dictionary"&gt;[http://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=alumnus ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United States Department of Education]], the term ''alumnae'' is used in conjunction with either [[women's colleges]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html |title=Archived: Women's Colleges in the United States: History, Issues, and Challenges |publisher=Ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815124724/http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html |archivedate=2006-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a female group of students. The term ''alumni'' is used in conjunction with either [[men's colleges]], a male group of students, or a mixed group of students:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In accordance with the rules of grammar governing the inflexion of nouns in the [[Romance languages]], the masculine plural alumni is correctly used for groups composed of both sexes: ''the alumni of Princeton University''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/alumni |title=alumni – Definitions from Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term is sometimes informally shortened to "alum" (optional plural "alums").&lt;ref&gt;"alum." Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.0.1). Based on the ''Random House Unabridged Dictionary'', © Random House, Inc. 2006. 1 December 2006. Dictionary.com http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/alum&lt;/ref&gt;

Alumni [[Class Reunion|reunion]]s are popular events at many institutions. They are usually organized by [[alumni association]]s and are often social occasions for [[fundraising]]. The terminology is primarily used in the USA, although its usage is gradually becoming more widespread.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4975">'''Attius Labeo''' (active 1st century AD) was a Roman writer during the reign of [[Nero]]. He is remembered for the derision that greeted his Latin translations of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', which came to epitomise bad verse. He translated the original Greek into Latin hexameters. The satirist [[Persius]] poured scorn on Labeo. Later his name was used by English poets of the [[Elizabethan era]] to attack each other's verse.

==Work==
His writings have not survived, but a single line of his translation has been preserved in [[scholia]]: "crudum manduces Priamum Priamique pisinnos", which was Labeo's translation of the words - ὠμòν ßεßρώΘοις Πρίαμον Πριάμοιó τε παîδας (Iliad, iv, 35).&lt;ref name = "lit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Freudenburg, ''Satires of Rome: Threatening Poses from Lucilius to Juvenal'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2001, p.154.&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of this surviving line, it has been suggested that the translation was considered to be vulgar, since the  words 'manduces' and 'pisinnos' would have "undoubtedly struck Romans as exotically 'low'".&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Freudenburg, ''The Cambridge companion to Roman satire'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, p.137.&lt;/ref&gt; In English the line means, roughly, "Raw, you'd chew both Priam and Priam's kids."

==Persius==
[[Persius]], a contemporary of the translator, refers to Labeo in his ''Satires'' as the epitome of a bad poet, mentioning him in his discussion of his reasons for taking up his pen:
 
O curas hominum! o quantum est in rebus inane!&lt;br&gt;
"Quis leget haec?" min tu istud ais? Nemo hercule. "Nemo?"&lt;br&gt;
Vel duo, vel nemo. "Turpe et miserabile." Quare?&lt;br&gt;
Ne mihi Polydamas et Troïades Labeonem&lt;br&gt;
Praetulerint? Nugae!

RGM Nesbitt translates these lines as: "The toils of men! The emptiness of life! 'Who's going to read that?' Are you talking to me? Nobody, of course. 'Nobody?' Well, two at the most. 'That's a poor show.' Why? Because Polydamas and the Trojan Women may prefer Labeo to me? Bosh."&lt;ref name = "nes"&gt;RGM Nesbitt, "Persius" in J. P. Sullivan (ed), ''Critical Essays on Roman Literature: Satire'', Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1963, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polydamas (mythology)|Polydamas]] was a Trojan leader in the ''Iliad'' characterised by his timidity. He and the women of Troy tried to stop [[Hector]] making a bold attack on the Greeks.

Persius also says that Labeo must have made the translation while "drunk with hellebore" (''ebria ueratro'').&lt;ref name = "lit"&gt;J. Wight Duff, ''A Literary History of Rome in the Silver Age: From Tiberius to Hadrian'', Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1927, p.342.&lt;/ref&gt;

==English satire==
Following Persius' use of the name, Elizabethan English satirists used the name "Labeo" as a code for a bad poet. "Labeo" appears in [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]]'s ''Satires'', in which he is accused of writing bad pastoral, erotic and heroic verse, evidently a reference to poetry of the time. The identity of Hall's "Labeo" is disputed. It has been suggested that [[Michael Drayton]] may be the target.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard H. Newdigate, ''Michael Drayton and His Circle'', Blackwell, Oxford, 1941 p.100&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Daniel]] has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Scott McCrea, ''The Case for Shakespeare'', Praeger, Westport, 2005,  p.138.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been argued that Hall's "Labeo" is a composite figure, standing for the vulgarity of modern poetry, as Hall saw it. In the view of Oscar James Campbell, "The English Labeo is best regarded as a type figure representing each and every one of the assiduous and tasteless Elizabethan translators."&lt;ref&gt;Oscar James Campbell, ''Comicall Satyre and Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida'', C.F. Braun, 1965, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]] mentions "Labeo" in ''Pygmalion's Image'', which includes the words, "So Labeo did complain his love was stone,/Obdurate, flinty, so relentless none." It may be that this use of the "Labeo" persona is an attack on [[Shakespeare]], since the lines resemble a passage in ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Davenport (ed), ''The Poems of John Marston'', Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, 1961, p.216.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[John Milton]] in an early essay quotes Persius on Labeo, referring to academic rivalries, 

:So provocative of animosity, even in the home of learning, is the rivalry of those who pursue different studies or whose opinions differ concerning the studies they pursue in common. However, I care not if "Polydamas and the women of Troy prefer Labeo to me;--a trifle this".&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis B. Tillyard, E. M. W. Tillyard (trans), ''Milton: Private Correspondence and Academic Exercises'', Cambridge, 1932, p.53.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beamforming''' or '''spatial filtering''' is  a [[signal processing]] technique used in [[sensor array]]s for directional signal transmission or reception.&lt;ref name="GOLBO16"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs-wm/53332.pdf |doi=10.5772/66.399| isbn=9781466557529|title=Beamforming in Wireless Networks|year=2016|last1=Golbon-Haghighi|first1=M.H. |journal=InTech Open| pages=163-199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.engr.wisc.edu/ece/faculty/vanveen_barry/ASSP_Mag_88.pdf|doi=10.1109/53.665|title=Beamforming: A versatile approach to spatial filtering|year=1988|last1=Van Veen|first1=B.D.|last2=Buckley|first2=K.M.|journal=IEEE ASSP Magazine|volume=5|issue=2|pages=4|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122135044/http://www.engr.wisc.edu/ece/faculty/vanveen_barry/ASSP_Mag_88.pdf|archivedate=2008-11-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved by combining elements in an [[antenna array]] in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] while others experience destructive interference. Beamforming can be used at both the transmitting and receiving ends in order to achieve spatial selectivity. The improvement compared with [[omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]] reception/transmission is known as the [[directivity]] of the array.

Beamforming can be used for [[radio]] or [[sound waves]]. It has found numerous applications in [[radar]], [[sonar]], [[seismology]], wireless communications, [[radio astronomy]], acoustics and [[biomedicine]]. Adaptive beamforming is used to detect and estimate the signal of interest at the output of a sensor array by means of optimal (e.g. least-squares) spatial filtering and interference rejection.

==Techniques==
To change the directionality of the array when transmitting, a beamformer controls the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] and relative [[amplitude]] of the signal at each transmitter, in order to create a pattern of constructive and destructive interference in the wavefront. When receiving, information from different sensors is combined in a way where the expected pattern of radiation is preferentially observed.

For example, in [[sonar]], to send a sharp pulse of underwater sound towards a ship in the distance, simply transmitting that sharp pulse from every [[sonar Projector|sonar projector]] in an array simultaneously fails because the ship will first hear the pulse from the speaker that happens to be nearest the ship, then later pulses from speakers that happen to be the further from the ship. The beamforming technique involves sending the pulse from each projector at slightly different times (the projector closest to the ship last), so that every pulse hits the ship at exactly the same time, producing the effect of a single strong pulse from a single powerful projector. The same technique can be carried out in air using [[loudspeaker]]s, or in radar/radio using [[antenna (radio)|antennas]].

In passive sonar, and in reception in active sonar, the beamforming technique involves combining delayed signals from each [[hydrophone]] at slightly different times (the hydrophone closest to the target will be combined after the longest delay), so that every signal reaches the output at exactly the same time, making one loud signal, as if the signal came from a single, very sensitive hydrophone. Receive beamforming can also be used with microphones or radar antennas.

With narrow-band systems the time delay is equivalent to a "phase shift", so in this case the array of antennas, each one shifted a slightly different amount, is called a [[phased array]]. A narrow band system, typical of [[radar]]s, is one where the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] is only a small fraction of the center frequency. With wide band systems this approximation no longer holds, which is typical in sonars.

In the receive beamformer the signal from each antenna may be amplified by a different "weight." Different weighting patterns (e.g., [[window function#Dolph–Chebyshev window|Dolph-Chebyshev]]) can be used to achieve the desired sensitivity patterns. A main lobe is produced together with nulls and sidelobes. As well as controlling the main lobe width ([[beamwidth]]) and the sidelobe levels, the position of a null can be controlled. This is useful to ignore noise or [[Radio jamming|jammers]] in one particular direction, while listening for events in other directions. A similar result can be obtained on transmission.

For the full mathematics on directing beams using amplitude and phase shifts, see the mathematical section in [[phased array]].

Beamforming techniques can be broadly divided into two categories:
* conventional (fixed or [[switched beam]]) beamformers
* adaptive beamformers or [[phased array]]
** Desired signal maximization mode
** Interference signal minimization or cancellation mode

Conventional beamformers use a fixed set of weightings and time-delays (or phasings) to combine the signals from the sensors in the array, primarily using only information about the location of the sensors in space and the wave directions of interest. In contrast, adaptive beamforming techniques (e.g., [[MUSIC (algorithm)|MUSIC]], [[SAMV (algorithm)|SAMV]]) generally combine this information with properties of the signals actually received by the array, typically to improve rejection of unwanted signals from other directions. This process may be carried out in either the time or the frequency domain.

As the name indicates, an [[adaptive beamformer]] is able to automatically adapt its response to different situations. Some criterion has to be set up to allow the adaptation to proceed such as minimizing the total noise output. Because of the variation of noise with frequency, in wide band systems it may be desirable to carry out the process in the [[frequency domain]].

Beamforming can be computationally intensive. Sonar phased array has a data rate low enough that it can be processed in real-time in [[Computer software|software]], which is flexible enough to transmit or receive in several directions at once. In contrast, radar phased array has a data rate so high that it usually requires dedicated hardware processing, which is hard-wired to transmit or receive in only one direction at a time. However, newer [[field programmable gate array]]s are fast enough to handle radar data in real-time, and can be quickly re-programmed like software, blurring the hardware/software distinction.

==Sonar beamforming requirements==
[[Sonar]] beamforming utilizes a similar technique to electromagnetic beamforming, but varies considerably in implementation details. Sonar applications vary from 1&amp;nbsp;Hz to as high as 2&amp;nbsp;MHz, and array elements may be few and large, or number in the hundreds yet very small. This will shift sonar beamforming design efforts significantly between demands of such system components as the "front end" (transducers, pre-amplifiers and digitizers) and the actual beamformer computational hardware downstream. High frequency, focused beam, multi-element imaging-search sonars and acoustic cameras often implement fifth-order spatial processing that places strains equivalent to Aegis radar demands on the processors.

Many sonar systems, such as on torpedoes, are made up of arrays of up to 100 elements that must accomplish [[beam steering]] over a 100 degree field of view and work in both active and passive modes.

Sonar arrays are used both actively and passively in 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional arrays.

* 1-dimensional "line" arrays are usually in multi-element passive\\\\\ systems towed behind ships and in single or multi-element side scan sonar.
* 2-dimensional "planar" arrays are common in active/passive ship hull mounted sonars and some [[side-scan sonar]].
* 3-dimensional spherical and cylindrical arrays are used in 'sonar domes' in the modern [[submarine]] and ships.

Sonar differs from radar in that in some applications such as wide-area-search all directions often need to be listened to, and in some applications broadcast to, simultaneously. Thus a multibeam system is needed. In a narrowband sonar receiver the phases for each beam can be manipulated entirely by signal processing software, as compared to present radar systems that use hardware to 'listen' in a single direction at a time.

Sonar also uses beamforming to compensate for the significant problem of the slower propagation speed of sound as compared to that of electromagnetic radiation. In side-look-sonars, the speed of the towing system or vehicle carrying the sonar is moving at sufficient speed to move the sonar out of the field of the returning sound "ping". In addition to focusing algorithms intended to improve reception, many side scan sonars also employ beam steering to look forward and backward to "catch" incoming pulses that would have been missed by a single sidelooking beam.

==Schemes==
* A conventional beamformer can be a simple beamformer also known as delay-and-sum beamformer. All the weights of the antenna elements can have equal magnitudes. The beamformer is steered to a specified direction only by selecting appropriate phases for each antenna. If the noise is uncorrelated and there are no directional interferences, the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] of a beamformer with &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; antennas receiving a signal of power &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, (where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_n^2&lt;/math&gt; is Noise variance or Noise power), is: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sigma_n^2}P\cdot L&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Null-steering beamformer]]
* [[Frequency domain beamformer]]

== History in wireless communication standards ==
Beamforming techniques used in [[cellular phone]] [[Comparison of mobile phone standards|standards]] have advanced through the generations to make use of more complex systems to achieve higher density cells, with higher throughput.
* Passive mode: (almost) non-standardized solutions
** Wideband Code Division Multiple Access ([[WCDMA]]) supports [[direction of arrival]] (DOA) based beamforming &lt;ref name="GOLBO16"/&gt;

* Active mode: mandatory standardized solutions

** Beyond 3G (4G, 5G, …) — More advanced beamforming solutions to support [[Space-division multiple access|SDMA]] such as closed loop beamforming and multi-dimensional beamforming are expected 

An increasing number of consumer [[802.11ac]] Wi-Fi devices with [[MIMO]] capability can support beamforming to boost data communication rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geier|first1=Eric|title=All about beamforming, the faster Wi-Fi you didn't know you needed|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2061907/all-about-beamforming-the-faster-wi-fi-you-didnt-know-you-needed.html|website=PC World|publisher=IDG Consumer &amp; SMB|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital, analog, and hybrid ==
For receive (but not transmit), there is a distinction between analog and digital beamforming. For example, if there are 100 sensor elements, the "digital beamforming" approach entails that each of the 100 signals passes through an [[analog-to-digital converter]] to create 100 digital data streams. Then these data streams are added up digitally, with appropriate scale-factors or phase-shifts, to get the composite signals. By contrast, the "analog beamforming" approach entails taking the 100 analog signals, scaling or phase-shifting them using analog methods, summing them, and then usually digitizing the ''single'' output data stream.

Digital beamforming has the advantage that the digital data streams (100 in this example) can be manipulated and combined in many possible ways in parallel, to get many different output signals in parallel. The signals from every direction can be measured simultaneously, and the signals can be integrated for a longer time when studying far-off objects and simultaneously integrated for a shorter time to study fast-moving close objects, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;''Systems Aspects of Digital Beam Forming Ubiquitous Radar'', Merrill Skolnik, 2002, [http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA403877]&lt;/ref&gt; This cannot be done as effectively for analog beamforming, not only because each parallel signal combination requires its own circuitry, but more fundamentally because digital data can be copied perfectly but analog data cannot. (There is only so much analog power available, and amplification adds noise.) Therefore, if the received analog signal is split up and sent into a large number of different signal combination circuits, it can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of each.

In [[MIMO]] communication systems with large number of antennas, so called massive MIMO systems, the beamforming algorithms executed at the digital [[baseband]] can get very complex. &lt;ref name="GOLBO16"/&gt;
In addition, if all beamforming is done at baseband, each antenna needs its own [[Radio frequency|RF]] feed. At high frequencies and with large number of antenna elements, this can be very costly, increase loss and complexity in the system. To remedy these issues, hybrid beamforming has been suggested where some of the beamforming is done using analog components and not digital.

There are many possible different functions that can be performed using analog components instead of at the digital baseband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7561395/ "Hybrid analog-digital downlink beamforming for massive MIMO system with uniform and non-uniform linear arrays"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7561012/ "Analog beamsteering for flexible hybrid beamforming design in mmwave communications"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7491314/ "Hybrid Beamforming in mm-Wave MIMO Systems Having a Finite Input Alphabet"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==For speech audio==
Beamforming can be used to try to extract sound sources in a room, such as multiple speakers in the [[cocktail party problem]]. This requires the locations of the speakers to be known in advance, for example by using the [[time of arrival]] from the sources to mics in the array, and inferring the locations from the distances.

Compared to [[Carrier signal|carrier-wave]] telecommunications, natural audio contains a variety of frequencies. It is advantageous to separate frequency bands prior to beamforming because different frequencies have different optimal beamform filters (and hence can be treated as separate problems, in parallel, and then recombined afterward). Properly isolating these bands involves specialized non-standard [[filter bank]]s. In contrast, for example, the standard [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] band-filters implicitly assume that the only frequencies present in the signal are exact [[harmonics]]; frequencies which lie between these harmonics will typically activate all of the FFT channels (which is not what is wanted in a beamform analysis). Instead, filters can{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}} be designed in which only local frequencies are detected by each channel (while retaining the recombination property to be able to reconstruct the original signal), and these are typically non-orthogonal unlike the FFT basis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8555">'''Bolt thrust''' or '''breech pressure''' is a term used in [[internal ballistics]] and firearms (whether small arms or artillery) that describes the amount of rearward force exerted by the [[propellant]] gases on the [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] or [[Breechblock|breech]] of a [[firearm action]] or [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]] when a projectile is fired. The applied [[force]] has both [[Euclidean vector#Length|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]], making it a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] quantity.

Bolt thrust is an important factor in weapons design. The greater the bolt thrust, the stronger the locking mechanism has to be to withstand it. Assuming equal engineering solutions and material adding strength to a locking mechanism causes an increase in weight and size of locking mechanism components.&lt;br&gt;

Bolt thrust is not a measure to determine the amount of [[recoil]]/[[free recoil]].

==Calculating bolt thrust==
With a basic calculation the bolt thrust produced by a particular firearms cartridge can be calculated fairly accurately.

===Formula===

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_{bolt} = P_{max} \cdot A_{internal}. &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riflebarrels.com/articles/custom_actions/bolt_lug_strength.htm A Look at Bolt Lug Strength By Dan Lilja] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303024616/http://www.riflebarrels.com/articles/custom_actions/bolt_lug_strength.htm |date=March 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

where:
*''F&lt;sub&gt;bolt&lt;/sub&gt;'' = the amount of bolt thrust
*''P&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;'' = the maximum (peak) chamber [[pressure]] of the firearms cartridge
*''A&lt;sub&gt;internal&lt;/sub&gt;'' = the inside area (of the cartridge case head) that the [[propellant]] [[deflagration]] gas pressure acts against 

Cartridge case heads and chambers are generally [[Circle|circular]]. The [[Area of a disk|area enclosed by a circle]] is:

:&lt;math&gt;Area = \pi r^2 \approx 3{.}1416 \cdot r^2. &lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''π'' ≈ 3.1416
*''r'' = the radius of the circle

Equivalently, denoting the diameter of the circle by ''d''.

:&lt;math&gt;Area = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \approx 0{.}7854 \cdot d^2. &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Bolt thrust.JPG|thumb|100px|The green line denotes the internal case head diameter and the red line the external case head base diameter of a rifle cartridge case.]]

A practical problem regarding this method is that the internal case head diameter of a particular production lot of cartridge cases (different brands and lots normally differ dimensionally) can not be easily measured without damaging them.

===Friction effects===
A complicating matter regarding bolt thrust is that a cartridge case expands and deforms under high pressure and starts to "stick" to the chamber. This "friction-effect" can be accounted for with finite elements calculations on a computer, but it is a lot of specialized work and generally not worth the trouble.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.varmintal.net/abolt.htm Stolle Panda Bolt Stress and Deflection Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

By oiling proof rounds during [[NATO EPVAT testing]] procedures, NATO test centers intentionally lower case friction to promote high bolt thrust levels.

==Practical method to estimate bolt thrust==
Instead of using the internal case head diameter, the external case head base diameter can also be measured with a [[caliper]] or [[micrometer]] or taken from the appropriate [[C.I.P.]] or [[SAAMI]] cartridge or chamber data tables and used for bolt thrust estimation calculations.

The basic calculation method is almost the same, but now the larger outside area of the cartridge case head is used instead of the smaller inside area.

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F_{bolt}} = P_{max} \cdot A_{external}. &lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''F&lt;sub&gt;bolt&lt;/sub&gt;'' = the amount of bolt thrust
*''P&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;'' = the maximum (peak) chamber pressure of the firearms cartridge
*''A&lt;sub&gt;external&lt;/sub&gt;'' = the outside area of the cartridge case head 

This method is fine for getting a good estimate regarding bolt thrust and assumes an overly large area that the gas pressure acts against yielding pessimistic estimations, generating a safety margin in the process for worse case scenarios which can result in increased maximum (peak) chamber pressure of the firearms cartridge, like a round that is chambered in an already very warm [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]] that can result in [[cooking off]] (i.e. a thermally induced unintended firing).

'''Bura Sign Language''' is a [[village sign language]] used by the [[Kilba people|Bura people]] around the village of [[Kukurpu]], 40 km (25 miles) south-east of [[Biu, Nigeria|Biu]], [[Nigeria]], an area with a high degree of [[hearing loss#Genetic|congenital deafness]]. What little is known about it is due to a brief visit and a videotape by Robert Blench in 2003.{{sfn|Blench|Nyst|2003|p = 14|postscript = , "None of the speakers had attended any school, let alone a school for the deaf and this is a remote area, so links with better-known sign languages seem unlikely. It seems likely that this deaf language is quite independent."}} It is "likely ... quite independent" from other, better-known sign languages such as [[Nigerian Sign Language]], since none of the signers have been to school and the area where it is used is rather remote.

Bura SL has the lax hand shapes and large sign space characteristic of indigenous West African sign languages. Many of the words are similar or identical to those of [[Adamorobe Sign Language]] and [[Nanabin Sign Language]] of Ghana, and appear to be based on the gestures common to the hearing population across West Africa. These involve conventionalized metaphors such as 'sweat' for "work" and 'sleep' for "next day".

The  '''''Centre de documentation et d'étude sur la langue internationale''''' ('''CDELI'''; English: Center for documentation and study about the international language) in [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]], [[Switzerland]], was founded in 1967 by [[:eo:Claude Gacond|Claude Gacond]]. It is the &lt;!-- ??? --&gt; main branch of the city's library and contains more than 20,000 bibliographic units. Interlinguistically neutral (thus "la langue internationale"), CDELI aims to preserve documents in and about all kinds of [[constructed language]]s: it offers, in addition to [[Esperanto]] books and periodicals, the richest collections of materials about [[Volapük]] and [[Occidental language|Occidental]], among others.

In firearms, a '''choke''' is a tapered constriction of a [[shotgun]] barrel's bore at the [[muzzle (firearm)|muzzle]] end.  Chokes are almost always used with modern hunting and target shotguns, to improve performance. Its purpose is to shape the spread of the shot to gain better range and accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.eb.com/eb/article-9067520 "Shotgun"]. (2011). ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved February 5, 2011, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online Library Edition&lt;/ref&gt;  Chokes are implemented as either screw-in chokes, selected for particular applications, or as fixed, permanent  chokes, integral to the shotgun barrel.

Chokes may be formed at the time of manufacture either as part of the barrel, by squeezing the end of the bore down over a [[mandrel]], or by threading the barrel and screwing in an interchangeable choke tube. Chokes may also be formed even after a barrel is manufactured by increasing the diameter of the bore inside a barrel, creating what is called a "jug choke", or by installing screw-in chokes within a barrel.  However implemented, a choke typically consists of a conical section that smoothly tapers from the bore diameter down to the choke diameter, followed by a cylindrical section of the choke diameter. Briley Manufacturing, one maker of interchangeable shotgun chokes, uses a conical portion about 3 times the bore diameter in length, so that the shot is gradually squeezed down with minimal deformation. The cylindrical section is shorter, usually 
15 to 19&amp;nbsp;mm (0.6 to 0.75&amp;nbsp;inches).

==Function==
A choke is designed to alter the distribution of the shot as it leaves the firearm. For shooting most game birds and [[clay target|clay pigeons]], a desirable pattern is one that is as large as possible while being dense enough to ensure multiple hits on the target.  Shotguns intended for defensive use often have cylinder or improved cylinder chokes for the widest shot pattern at typically short defensive ranges.  The choke should be tailored to the range and size of the targets. A skeet shooter shooting at close targets might use {{convert|0.13|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of constriction to produce a {{convert|75|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter pattern at a distance of {{convert|20|m|yd|abbr=on}}. A [[trap shooting|trap]] shooter shooting at distant targets might use {{convert|0.75|mm|in|abbr=on}} of constriction to produce a {{convert|75|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter pattern at {{convert|35|m|yd|abbr=on}}. Special chokes for turkey hunting, which requires long range shots at the small head and neck of the bird, can go as high as {{convert|1.5|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. The use of too much choke and a small pattern increases the difficulty of hitting the target; the use of too little choke produces large patterns with insufficient pellet density to reliably break targets or kill game. "Cylinder barrels" have no constriction.

==History==
The invention of choke boring is usually attributed to American gunsmiths.  Mr. J.W. Long, in his book ''American Wildfowling'', credits a Mr. Jeremiah Smith of Southfield, [[Rhode Island]], as the gunsmith who first discovered the concept, as far back as 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Gun and its Development | author= W. W. Greener | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=obxNmpITIPkC&amp;pg=PA256&amp;lpg=PA256&amp;dq=Pape+English+gunsmith+choke#v=onepage&amp;q=Pape%20English%20gunsmith%20choke&amp;f=false |year=2002|origyear= 1881 | page=256 |accessdate=2013-02-15|isbn= 9781585747344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known patents for choke boring were granted [[Sylvester H. Roper]], an American inventor and gunsmith.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|53881}}, Improvement In Revolving Fire-Arms, April 10, 1866; and {{US patent|79861}}, Improvements In Detachable Muzzle For Shot-Guns, dated July 14, 1868&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a patent claim in London by W.R. Pape, an English gun maker, whose patent application was six weeks too late to the 1866 Roper patent. 

While American gunsmiths were the pioneers of the choke boring system, they had not really progressed beyond the elementary stage and their choked shotguns would lead, throw irregular patterns, and not shoot straight.

[[W. W. Greener]]'s first intimation of the choke formation was derived from instructions given in a customer's letter, in early 1874. The customer's instructions described a choke, but did not give any details on the size or shape, or how it was to be obtained. Hence, Greener had to conduct many experiments to determine the perfect shape and size of a choke for a given bore. After that, he developed tools to produce the choke bore profile correctly and smoothly. The system of choke boring that he pioneered was so successful that it was later adopted by other manufacturers and hence, some authorities give him the credit for inventing the concept, since his method became the first repeatable method of choke boring.  [[William Wellington Greener]] is thus widely credited as being the inventor of the first practical choke, as documented in his classic 1888 publication, ''The Gun and its Development''.&lt;ref name="ssaa"&gt;{{cite web|title=A beginner's guide to shotgun chokes | url=http://www.ssaa.org.au/stories/shotguns-a-beginners-guide-to-shotgun-chokes.html#.UR6Im6U4t8E | publisher=Australian Shooter | author=John Robinson | date=November 2004 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 1874, the first mention of Greener's choke bore appeared in an article by J.H. Walsh, the editor of ''Field'' magazine. The article mentioned the extraordinary shot pattern that the Greener shotgun could produce. The next issue came with an advertisement from Greener, stating that the firm would guarantee that their new guns would shoot a closer pattern than any other manufacturer. The advertisement claimed that Greener 12 bores were warranted to shoot an average pattern of 210, when the best 12 bore gun in the London Gun Trial of 1866 could only average 127. Naturally, the advertisement generated considerable controversy, especially from rival manufacturers of cylinder guns, who refused to believe the numbers quoted in the advertisement.

To resolve the controversy, the editors of ''Field'' magazine decided to conduct a public trial in 1875. The London Trial of 1875 pitted choke bores and cylinder guns of various manufacturers in four categories—Class 1 (large bores, any boring), Class 2 (choke bores, 12 gauge), Class 3 (guns of English boring or cylinders) and Class 4 (small gauges, any boring). The choke bored guns performed better than the cylinder guns in all these tests, and W.W. Greener choke bore guns won the class 1, class 2 and class 4 categories. Greener Choke bores also won at the London Gun Trials of 1877 and 1879, and the Chicago Field Gun Trial of 1879. The results of these trials were responsible for making the W.W. Greener name famous, and for confirming the practical advantage of a repeatable method of controlling the performance of a choke on a shotgun.

==Constriction==
[[File:Shotgun choke.svg|thumb|right|Greatly exaggerated illustration of different choke constrictions, German names:&lt;br/&gt;
A: Cylinder (no choke)&lt;br/&gt;
B: Improved cylinder,&lt;br/&gt;
C: Glocken,&lt;br/&gt;
D: Skeet,&lt;br/&gt;
E: Full (normal),&lt;br/&gt;
F: Spitzbogen,&lt;br/&gt;
G: Jug,&lt;br/&gt;
H: Paradox.]]
The exit end of a choke is smaller by some dimension than the actual [[Gauge (bore diameter)|bore]] of the barrel. This difference in diameter is the amount of constriction. For example, for a 12 gauge, the bore diameter of the barrel is nominally {{convert|1.85|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, although different manufacturers do vary their as-manufactured bore from this diameter slightly.  This is commonly called "overbore", when the as-built diameter exceeds the nominal actual diameter of {{convert|1.85|cm|in|abbr=on}}.  The advantages touted for "overbore" are a perceived reduction in recoil, and a lessened shot deformation for improving shot patterns.

Generally the constriction ranges for chokes will be 0.00-1.15&amp;nbsp;mm (0.00-0.045&amp;nbsp;inch) while the constriction for relatively common turkey chokes may be as much as 2.50&amp;nbsp;mm (0.10&amp;nbsp;inch). Choke is measured experimentally by observing the percentage of pellets in a charge that impact inside a 75&amp;nbsp;cm circle at 35&amp;nbsp;m (25&amp;nbsp;m for "cylinder" and "Skeet1").&lt;ref name="fieldandclays" /&gt; Although different choke manufacturers have different identification of their chokes, the notches in the chart below are generally accepted.&lt;ref name="notches" /&gt;

A common method of expressing the amount of constriction is by "points".  A "point" is equivalent to {{convert|0.025|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of constriction of the inner diameter of a choke. Hence, 40 points of constriction would correspond to a constriction of 0.040&amp;nbsp;inch (≈&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;mm) in the inner diameter of a choke, corresponding to "Extra Full".

===Markings===
[[File:Chokes photos tamil.jpg|thumb|right|'''Left''': Permenant choke. '''Center''': Replaceable choke inserted into the muzzle. '''Right''': Threaded barrel without choke insert.]]
The marking is usually stamped on the underside of the barrel for older guns without choke tubes, or is spelled out in abbreviated text on the barrel near the gauge marking.

In the case of choke tubes, the amount of choke for each barrel is usually stamped on the side of the choke tube, or there may be thin slots cut in the exposed rim of the tube at the barrel opening with the number of slots corresponding to the number of *'s in this table.  (The 4 wider slots present in the exposed rim of the tube are intended for use with a choke wrench, in the event a choke tube ever becomes stuck in the barrel, and have no relationship to the amount of choke.)

For the case of older, side-by-side, Spanish guns, the choke is often marked on the tang of the barrels, becoming exposed when the wooden forearm is removed, after the double barrels are pivoted off of the break-action, such as when performing a field-stripping and cleaning.  The manufacturer's mark, along with the proof marks, and the weight of the barrels in grams, and the proof test pressures are also stamped alongside the choke marking on the tang of the barrels, near where the shells are inserted into the barrels.

In practice, choke tubes tighter than "Full", such as "Turkey", are also commonly marked with but a single thin notch on the end of the tube.  Hence, to distinguish between "Full" vs. even tighter chokes, such as "Turkey", it becomes necessary to measure the bore exit diameter of the choke tube to determine precisely which choke type is present among the "Full" and tighter (smaller diameter) chokes.

===Alternative chokes===
Other specialized choke tubes exist as well. Some turkey hunting tubes have constrictions greater than "Turkey", or additional features like porting to reduce recoil, or "straight rifling" that is designed to stop any spin that the shot column might acquire when traveling down the barrel. These tubes are often extended tubes, meaning they project beyond the end of the bore, giving more room for things like a longer conical section. Shot spreaders or diffusion chokes work opposite of normal chokes—they are designed to spread the shot more than a cylinder bore, generating wider patterns for very short range use. A basic spreader choke is simply a "choke" with a larger diameter than the barrel; the spreader choke still makes the barrel more restrictive than just having a shorter barrel, but a shorter barrel may not be allowed due to legal restrictions. A number of recent spreader chokes, such as the Briley "Diffusion" line, actually use rifling in the choke to spin the shot slightly, creating a wider spread.  The Briley Diffusion uses a 1 in 36&amp;nbsp;cm twist, as does the FABARM Lion Paradox shotgun.

Oval chokes, which are designed to provide a shot pattern wider than it is tall, are sometimes found on [[combat shotgun]]s, primarily those of the [[Vietnam War]] era. They were available for aftermarket addition in the 1970s from companies like A &amp; W Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The police shotgun manual|publisher=Thomas|author=Roger H. Robinson|year=1973|isbn=0-398-02630-0|pages=91–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military versions of the Ithaca 37 with ''duckbill'' choke were used in limited numbers during the Vietnam War by US Navy Seals. It arguably increased effectiveness in close range engagements against multiple targets. Two major disadvantages plagued the system. One was erratic patterning. The second was that the shot would spread too quickly providing a very limited effective zone.

Offset chokes, where the pattern is intentionally slightly off of center, are used to change the point of impact. For instance, an offset choke can be used to make a double barrelled shotgun with poorly aligned barrels hit the same spot with both barrels.

For shotguns with fixed chokes integral to the barrel, it is sometimes still possible to change the choke to a tighter choke.  This is done by increasing the diameter of the bore inside the barrel for a short length of barrel, while the portion of the barrel and bore nearest the muzzle is left as it was.  The effect is to form what is called a "jug choke" or a "reverse choke".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choke adjusting with Gilchrist Precision Choke Reamer | url=http://www.brownells.com/userdocs/learn/Inst-543.pdf | publisher=Brownells | year=2003 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method is sometimes used by gunsmiths to implement a tighter choke on an existing gun without replaceable chokes, and can be done without requiring replacement of a barrel and without installing new screw-in replaceable chokes.  Advantages claimed for a "jug choke" include improved patterns, reduction of recoil, and an increase of choke in a shotgun that does not have replaceable choke tubes.  When a "jug choke" is implemented in an existing choked barrel, the bore inside the bored-out section of barrel effectively becomes "overbored", and this also typically lessens the amount of shot deformation, thereby increasing the shot pattern density.&lt;ref name="ssaa" /&gt;

==Steel shot and alternatives==
Older shotgun barrels and chokes were designed for use with lead shot only.  Due to changing worldwide waterfowl hunting law restrictions, the use of lead shot has been banned in many parts of the world by international agreement. The reason is that waterfowl hunting with lead shot was identified as a major cause of [[lead poisoning]] in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where lead shot collects.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Glen C. and Frank C. Bellrose.  1986.  A Review of the Problem of Lead Poisoning in Waterfowl.  Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, Illinois. Special Publication 4. 34pp. [https://web.archive.org/web/19990422091004/http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/othrdata/pbpoison/pbpoison.htm full report from scholar.google.com (cache)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Scheuhammer and S. L. Norris. 1996. "The ecotoxicology of lead shot and lead fishing weights" ''[[Ecotoxicology]]'' Vol. 5 Number 5 pp. 279-295&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, UK, Canada, and many western European countries (France as of 2006), all shot used for [[waterfowl]] must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any [[lead]]. One method commonly used to work around this legislative change, at least for hunters with newer shotguns with chokes designed for steel shot, is to use steel shot, but the use of steel shot may damage chokes on older firearms that were designed for use with lead shot only such as Damascus-barreled shotguns.  Most non-toxic shot shells produce higher chamber pressures than lead shot and can severely damage these older shotguns and as a rule of thumb, use a more open choke than you would for lead shells.  An example would be an improved cylinder choke will perform like a modified choke when shooting steel or tungsten shells.  For such hunters, wishing to continue to use older shotguns with chokes not rated for use with steel shot, the use of bismuth shotshells in the place of lead shotshells is common.  Other alternatives to lead shotshells than bismuth also exist that are legal for hunting waterfowl, and which are safe for use with older chokes.  Within recent years, several companies have created "heavier than lead" non-toxic shot out of [[tungsten]], [[bismuth]], or other elements with a density similar to or greater than lead, and with a shot softness comparable to lead. These shells provide more consistent patterns than steel shot and provide greater range than steel shot. They are also generally safe to use in older shotguns with barrels and chokes not rated for use with steel shot, such as for bismuth and tungsten-polymer (although not tungsten-iron) shot.  The increase in performance of "heavier than lead" non-toxic shot comes at a higher cost.  Boxes of such non-toxic shotshells can cost upwards of $40 (2013) a box for twenty five shells, compared with less than $8 per box (2013) for lead pellet shotshells.

In practice, steel shot patterns as much as two chokes tighter for a given amount of constriction.  In other words, a choke that patterns "Modified" with lead or bismuth shot would give a "Full" pattern with steel shot.  To avoid excessive wear or grooving from occurring within chokes when shooting steel shot, many manufacturers recommend avoiding shooting steel shot in any chokes marked tighter than "Modified", unless the choke tube is specifically marked as being safe for use with steel shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trulock FAQ on Choke Tubes| url=http://www.trulockchokes.com/faqs.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''convulsion''' is a medical condition where body [[muscles]] contract and relax rapidly and repeatedly, resulting in an uncontrolled shaking of the body.&lt;ref name=MedlinePlusEncyclopedia003200&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003200|Seizures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[epileptic seizure|epileptic seizures]] typically include convulsions, the term ''convulsion'' is sometimes used as a synonym for ''seizure''. However, not all epileptic seizures lead to convulsions, and not all convulsions are caused by epileptic seizures. Convulsions are also consistent with an [[electric shock]] and improper enriched air scuba diving. For non-epileptic convulsions, see [[non-epileptic seizure]]s.

The word "fit" is sometimes used to mean a convulsion or epileptic seizure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fit%5B3%5D Merriam-Webster: Fit].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
When a person is having a convulsion, they may experience several different symptoms. These may include: a brief blackout, confusion, drooling, loss of bowel/bladder control, sudden shaking of entire body, uncontrollable [[muscle spasm]]s, temporary cessation of breathing, and many more. Symptoms usually last from a few seconds to around 15 minutes. If someone has a fit like this, it is advised to make sure they don't fall and injure themselves, cushion their head and loosen any restricting clothing/jewelry, and also call for medical help. Do not try to pin/hold them in place, as this could possibly cause harm or injury to the individual. Do not place anything between the person's teeth during a seizure (including your fingers).&lt;ref name=MedlinePlusEncyclopedia003200/&gt;

===Generalized seizures===
{{main|Tonic-clonic seizures}}

The most common type of seizure is called a generalized seizure, also known as a generalized convulsion. This is characterized by a loss of consciousness which may lead to the person collapsing. The body stiffens for about a minute and then jerks uncontrollably for the next minute. During this, the patient may fall and injure themselves or bite their tongue and lose control of their bladder. A familial history of this puts a person at a greater risk for developing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/guide/types-of-seizures-their-symptoms |title=Epilepsy Seizure Types and Symptoms |publisher=WebMD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/grand-mal-seizure/basics/causes/con-20021356 |title=Grand mal seizure causes |publisher=Mayo Clinic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Convulsions are often the result of abnormal electrical activity in the [[brain]]. The specific cause is often not clear. Convulsions can be caused by specific chemicals in the blood, as well as infections like [[meningitis]] or [[encephalitis]]. A common cause in children is [[febrile seizures]]. Other possibilities include [[celiac disease]],&lt;ref name='"NIDDK-CD2016"'&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition &amp; Facts for Celiac Disease. What are the complications of celiac disease?|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/celiac-disease/definition-facts|publisher=[[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|NIDDK]]|date=June 2016|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[head trauma]], [[stroke]] or lack of oxygen to the brain. Sometimes the convulsion can be caused by genetic defects or [[brain tumor]]s.&lt;ref name=MedlinePlusEncyclopedia003200/&gt; Convulsions can also occur when the [[hypoglycemia|blood sugar is too low]] and deficiency of [[vitamin B6]] (pyridoxine).
In Nigeria, [[Malaria]],&lt;ref name='"PublicHealthNigeria"'&gt;{{cite web|title=Management of Convulsion in Children, a Health concern in Nigeria|url=https://publichealthng.com/management-of-convulsion-in-children-a-health-concern-in-nigeria/|publisher=[[Public Health Nigeria]]|date=October 2018|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a very important cause of Convulsions among children under 5 years of age.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11627">'''Country definitives''', formerly known as '''regional postage stamps of Great Britain''' are the [[postage stamp]]s issued for regions of the United Kingdom, reflecting the regional identity of the various countries and islands of the British isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Lions, Leopards, Unicorns &amp; Dragons: The first "Regional" stamps | publisher=[[The British Postal Museum &amp; Archive]] | date=9 March 2009 | url=https://postalheritage.wordpress.com/2009/03/09/lions-leopards-unicorns-dragons-the-first-regional-stamps/ | accessdate=16 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General - definitive postage stamps - proposal to change 'regional' title (summary)|url=http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/collections/getrecord/GB813_P_153_016_3002|publisher=The British Postal Museum and archive|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postage stamps were first issued by Great Britain in May 1840 and were valid throughout the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] until 1922 and in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland thereafter.

In 1958, special regional issues were introduced, with the [[Channel Islands]], [[Isle of Man]], Northern Ireland, [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] receiving their own special issues.  The designs used the same portrait as the [[Wilding series|Wildings]], but were specially designed to incorporate the symbols of each of the [[home nations]] and [[Crown dependencies]].

Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Isle of Man regional stamps were changed to the [[Machin series|Machins]] on decimalisation, with the relevant emblems shown in the top left hand corner.  They were replaced between 1999 and 2000 with new designs for the four home nations.

While generally sold at post offices in their respective areas, all were valid throughout the UK and, until they became postally independent, the Crown Dependencies.

==Abandoned idea in the 1940s==
The idea of regional stamps came up after World War II to help the tourism in the Channel Islands, which were occupied by German forces until the end of the conflict. The concept was extended to all United Kingdom's regions and essays were prepared: positions of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]'s head&lt;ref&gt;Essays of 1946 from [[The British Postal Museum &amp; Archive]] reproduced in Julia Lee, "Unseen material on show in regional definitives display", ''[[Stamp Magazine]]'' #74-6, June 2008, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and symbols.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/exhibitions/lions/islands One black and white example] reproduced on ''Lions, Leopards, Unicorns &amp; Dragons: The first "Regional" stamps'', on-line exhibition, [[The British Postal Museum &amp; Archive]], May 2008, retrieved 10 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1958 issues==
Special committees were established to choose the heraldic emblems or symbols for the each country or island. These are discussed in the sections below. The first value (3d deep lilac) of the regional issues were introduced on 18 August 1958&lt;ref name="gibbons"&gt;Stanley Gibbons Concise Stamp Catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; in the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The design consisted of the [[Dorothy Wilding]]'s portrait of the Queen surrounded by appropriate regional symbols. Other values were introduced at later dates. Some of the issue dates are unclear, as the stamps were first issued at the [[Philatelic Bureau]] in Edinburgh, others first at the Philatelic Counter in London, yet others first in the region.

The colours used were consistent across the various regions, and stayed constant with the exception of the 4d value, which was issued in three different colours – initially ultramarine, then olive-sepia and finally vermilion. The 4d's initial colour change was made to bring it into line with that used by the newly issued pre-decimal Machin series (from 5 June 1967 onwards). The Machin 4d's colour was then changed because of complaints that the date of postmarks (critical for football pool entries) could not be read on so dark a colour. All the regional 4d's were then changed again to the new Machin colour of vermilion.

=== Scotland ===
The Scottish Committee chose designs by John B. Fleming, Gordon F. Huntly and Archie B. Imrie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/page/regional-scotland |title=Regional Stamps for Scotland |publisher=[[The British Postal Museum &amp; Archive]] |date=21 February 1957 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wales ===
The symbols selected by the Welsh committee were a [[Welsh Dragon]] (''passant'') and the leek. Three designs by Reynolds Stone were chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/page/regional-wales |title=Regional Stamps for Wales |publisher=[[The British Postal Museum &amp; Archive]] |date=18 April 1957 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Northern Ireland ===
There were perceived to be some particular problems creating the Northern Ireland definitives because of a lack of symbols that might be used to represent Northern Ireland while avoiding contentious political symbolism. The committee charged with organising the choice of design decided on Dorothy Wilding's portrait of the Queen augmented with symbols: the Red Hand of Ulster (the emblem of the O’Neills – the royal house of Ulster); the Arms of Northern Ireland ''(without supporters)''; the six-pointed Crowned Star with the Red Hand; the Flax Plant (with or without leaves); and a Field Gate with ''Ulster'' pillars.  Several local artists were chosen to present designs and one from each was chosen by the Queen. The artists were: Thomas Collins; Leonard Pilton; William Hollywood; Colin Middleton; Miss T. Robinson. Three, Collins; Pilton and Hollywood were chosen to be issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/page/qeii1 |title=Elizabeth II Stamps Until 1964 |work=[[The British Postal Museum &amp; Archive]] |year=2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/page/regional-northernireland |title=Regional stamps for Northern Ireland |work=[[The British Postal Museum &amp; Archive]] |year=2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earsathome.com/mandm4.html |title=Pictorial Booklets of Great Britain |first=Walter |last=Owen |publisher=earsathome.com |year=2010 |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Channel Islands ===
Eric Piprell designed the Guernsey stamps. These show the Crown of William the Conqueror and the Guernsey lily as described in the book The Lilium Sarniense by James Douglas published in 1975. He also designed the {{frac|2|1|2}}d, which showed a variation of the Lily and Crown theme. The Jersey stamps were designed by William Gardner, with the exception of the {{frac|2|1|2}}d issue which was designed by Edmund Blampied. The Gardner design showed the Mace presented to the island by Charles II in 1663 and the Arms of Jersey as the main subjects with a potato and tomato plant in the borders to emphasise the importance of agriculture.  The Blampied design also used the Mace and Arms, but in different positions and omitted the plants. Source: Channel Islands Stamps and Postal History, published by Stanley Gibbons in 1979.

[[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]] became postally independent on 1 October 1969 when they each issued their own inaugural series.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== The Isle of Man ===
The Isle of Man stamps were designed by John Nicholson, included the ''[[Triskelion#Manx triskelion|tre cassyn]]'' (Three Legs) escutcheoned (on a shield), the three spurs looking rather like stars, and had a bordering ring-chain pattern based on designs on ancient Manx stone crosses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/page/regional-islands |title=Regional Stamps for the Islands |publisher=[[The British Postal Museum &amp; Archive]] |date=9 May 1945 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decimal issues==
[[File:GBIoMRegional7hpStamp.JPG|thumb|Isle of Man {{frac|7|1|2}}p regional issue of 1971]]
On 7 July 1971&lt;ref name="gibbons" /&gt; the previous Wilding based designs for the Isle of Man, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were replaced with designs similar to the standard British Machin portrait [[Definitive stamp|definitives]]. Each stamp had a reduced size portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by [[Arnold Machin]] with a national emblem in the top left corner, the latter designed by [[Jeffery Matthews]].&lt;ref name="GBCC interview p1"&gt;[http://www.gbstamps.com/gbcc/gbcc_matthews_intvw1.html Interview of Jeffery Matthews during Stamp Show 2000], ''The Chronicle'', October 2000, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The emblems used were :
* Isle of Man: The [[triskelion]];
* Northern Ireland: The "[[Red Hand]]" in a star beneath a crown;
* Scotland: The lion rampant;
* Wales: The Welsh dragon.

The colours of the Machin regionals were the same as those of the main Machin issues. There are a few exceptions, for example the 4½p regionals are a darker blue. Not all the values and colours of the main issue appear in the regionals, but as these designs remained in use in the other regions for the rest of the 20th century, a large number of values were issued.

The Isle of Man became postally autonomous on 5 July 1973&lt;ref name="gibbons" /&gt; and only four Machin values were therefore ever issued for this region:
* {{frac|2|1|2}}p bright magenta
* 3p ultramarine
* 5p reddish violet
* {{frac|7|1|2}}p chestnut

==Pictorial issues==
In the late 1990s, new designs were produced for each of the 4 British home nations including (for the first time ever) England. Four values were issued for each nation, firstly Scotland and Wales on 8 June 1999, Northern Ireland on 6 March 2001 and finally, England on 23 April 2001,&lt;ref name="gibbons" /&gt; each showing heraldic and other symbols of the relevant country. These were initially borderless ([[bleed (printing)|full-bleed]]), but in 2003 these were replaced with stamps having white borders. As postal rates have changed, so have the values denominated on some of the stamps. The '2nd' and '1st' values have remained constant, but the 'E' value reverted to 40p initially, and then increased to 42p, 44p, 48p, 50p and 56p. The 64p and 65p values have been reissued as 68p, 72p, 78p, 81p, 90p and 97p values.

'''Damakawa''' is a [[moribund language|moribund]] [[Benue–Congo]] language of northwest [[Nigeria]]. There are no longer any speakers of the language, although the oldest people can remember a few words. Approximately 80 or so words and phrases were collected, with difficulty, in April 2008 (the language seems to have been unknown to linguists until then).&lt;ref&gt;McGill, Stuart. 2008. [http://www.cicipu.org/papers/damakawa.pdf The Damakawa language. Unpublished manuscript.].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Damakawa have shifted to the nearby larger language [[C'Lela]], and it is likely that all, or almost all of them, also speak the [[lingua franca]] [[Hausa language|Hausa]]. The Hausa name for the ethnic group is also Damakawa.

==Classification==
Based on such a small amount of data of uncertain reliability, it is hard to classify Damakawa precisely. It is probably best placed in the [[Northwest Kainji]] branch of [[Benue–Congo]]. The words that have been collected show similarities with both [[C'Lela]] and [[Kambari languages]], and it may be that the Kambari words are loans or mis-rememberings.

==Alternative names==
The nearby [[Cicipu]] speakers call the Damakawa language 'Tidama'un'. In the trade language [[Hausa language|Hausa]] the expected name for the language would be Damakanci, given the people are called Damakawa. However Damakawa seems to be preferred by the Damakawa themselves, as far as can be ascertained.

==Geographic distribution==
The Damakawa people probably number about 500-1000, and live in three villages near Maganda in Sakaba Local Government Area, [[Kebbi State]].

'''Data culture''' is the principle established in the process of social practice in both public and private sectors which requires all staffs and decision-makers to focus on the information conveyed by the existing data, and make decisions and changes according to these results instead of leading the development of the company based on experience in the particular field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cognizant.com/InsightsWhitepapers/how-to-create-a-data-culture-codex1408.pdf|title=How to Create a Data Culture|last=Ramaswamy|first=Poornima|date=June 2015|website=Cognizant|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;These data might include but are not limited to: general economical or social trends in the market, sales volume of products, or even performance of staffs pointing to their efficiency and productivity. Despite business field, data culture are also applied in the social infrastructure system, such as urban planning projects, in order to impact the process of data production and data practices of daily usage, such as [[Smart City]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/992119756|title=Data and the city|others=Kitchin, Rob,, Lauriault, Tracey P.,, McArdle, Gavin,|isbn=1138222631|location=Abingdon, Oxon|oclc=992119756}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, to build data culture, the departments and organizations have to let the data talk itself, and trust the steering of statistics. Being successful as a data-driven entity requires the active participation of all staffs involved in an organization, therefore open access to data is significant in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/23/five-building-blocks-of-a-data-driven-culture/|title=Five building blocks of a data-driven&amp;nbsp;culture|last=Anderson|first=Carl|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The idea of data culture has been under the spotlight of business field since the beginning of the 21st century, and is gaining popularity in recent years. Although first introduced in a scientific approach, the idea is now associated with both the science field and social sectors.

Bowker clearly conveyed the idea of "local data culture" in his academic paper in terms of biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.26.6449&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014, Microsoft made a series of announcements including their intention to build data culture into everyday life through their services including Office 365, Azure and SQL Server.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2014/04/15/a-data-culture-for-everyone/|title=A data culture for everyone - The Official Microsoft Blog|date=2014-04-15|work=The Official Microsoft Blog|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2015, Microsoft organized a series of workshops about data culture in alliance with Hortonworks and KPMG UK, offering data analysts and other professional working in the field of Big Data an opportunity to understand the data culture of this gigantic company and help them build their own data culture in private sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2015/02/18/microsoft-data-culture-series-for-developers-data-architects-data-scientists-database-administrators-events-in-edinburgh-leeds-birmingham-reading-and-london/|title=Microsoft Data Culture series for Developers, Data Architects, Data Scientists, Database Administrators events in Edinburgh, Leeds, Birmingham, Reading and London|work=Microsoft UK Faculty Connection|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components and roles ==

=== Participants ===
Participants are both producers of data and people who can contribute to the data culture by making influential changes. In the building process of data culture in a particular entity, employees at different levels are all supposed to obtain the ability of illustrating their works with relative statistics. This includes but is not limited to the goal of their job, the purpose of a specific task, and solutions they could bring up according to problems pointed out by data. Also, participants are allowed to make decisions within the section they take charge of, and experience changes happened due to their innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/951028197|title=Winning with data : transform your culture, empower your people, and shape the future|last=1981-|first=Tunguz, Tomasz,|others=Bien, Frank, 1967-|isbn=9781119257394|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|oclc=951028197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data scientists ===
Data analysts serve as an important part in the establishment of a data culture, as they often receive first-hand material and raw data, and the way they connect all the components together can determine the efficiency of communication between ordinary participants and decision-makers. Also, they are responsible for the analysis of information conveyed by the data. Having data scientists in each specific section of a company would be an ideal situation for a data-driven entity, therefore guaranteeing data access whenever needed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Decision-makers ===
Decision-makers are those who apply changes and determine the direction of development in a company. In this case, they would make important decisions according to the trends and information highlighted by the data produced either in their own companies internally or statistics of the target market they want their corporations to aim at. Also, to build a data culture, decision makers have to emphasize their intention of requiring data analyses, therefore driving the motivation of staffs to deal with raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torbeck|first=Lynn|date=Autumn 2011|title=Data culture|url=http://link.galegroup.com.proxy.library.carleton.ca/apps/doc/A277000766/AONE?u=ocul_carleton&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=d5de2d5d.|journal=Journal of Validation Technology|volume=17.4|pages=12+|via=Academic OneFile}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Data-driven companies ==

=== Microsoft ===
The [[Microsoft]] team, under the management of Satya Nadella, depends on data to drive both major market decisions and their daily behaviors. Microsoft focuses on data visualization and advocates that participants and employees should have the right to access the company's data. The company uses tools such as [[Power BI]] in order to have individual workers get involved and contribute to the future of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/itshowcase/Article/Content/907/Empowering-your-organization-to-embrace-a-data-culture-with-Power-BI|title=Empowering your organization to embrace a data culture with Power BI|website=Microsoft IT Showcase|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capita===
[[Capita]] is a British agency that assists clients in both government departments and enterprises to understand themselves better, using advanced techniques of data analysis. Established in 1984, they advocate their clients to build their own data culture with relative database in their own field of career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.capita.com/about-us/our-story/|title=Our story|website=Capita|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.capita.com/about-us/#|title=About us|website=Capita|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socrata===
[[Socrata]] is a US-based company which serves both public sectors and the civil society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socrata.com/|title=The Data Platform for 21st Century Digital Government|website=Socrata, Inc.|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They assist companies and organizations reach open data from the federal government in order to either improve the working progress of the government or assist social groups that are lack of resources. Their core value is tied to open data and they tend to focus on corporations which are in need of funding in order to process data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://socrata.com/company-info/|title=What Is Socrata? Learn All About the Company.|work=Socrata, Inc.|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cloud-based service they provide allow government departments to communicate with the public through publishing their official data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Counter opinions ==

=== Data privacy ===
Some companies feel that it is important to keep the data private at the executive level. Although it is possible for all staff in a company to produce and process the data together, it is restricted for data to be free from the approach of participants at the elementary level. Some companies use the idea of Data Warehouse, a system that limits access to data. Only people in charge could access the data, and other people requiring access need to go through the assessment of warehouse staff.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904285472|title=Data driven : creating a data culture|last=DJ,|first=Patil,|others=Mason, Hilary,|isbn=9781491921197|location=Sebastopol, CA|oclc=904285472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Efficiency ===
As long as data bureaucracy is convenient for open access to databases, the large number of users might slow down the speed of processing in a particular system. Also, it might be difficult for users to search for what they want if the data bureaucracy system is not facilitated with proper tools. In this case, Data Warehouse would be more efficient for users who are not able to perform professionally when they seek for data.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Rationalism ===
A rational method of building or expanding an enterprise is an opposite approach to an empirical one. The decisions of rationalists are often evaluated according to their personal spirit and their existing cognition of the world. In terms of this approach, decision-makers depend on logic rather than social phenomena and phenomena appearing at the front line of an industry to make changes. The fact that decision-making process is not limited to the executive team anymore lead to the hesitation of some people on the management level, therefore they refuse to develop data culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/867854355|title=The culture of big data|last=Mike.|first=Barlow,|date=2013|publisher=O'Reilly Media|isbn=9781491946725|location=Sebastopol, Calif.|oclc=867854355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fedor Bronnikov 014.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Poetry reading by Horace, an early advocate of decorum. Painting by [[Fyodor Bronnikov]]]]
'''Decorum''' (from the [[Latin]]: "right, proper") was a principle of classical [[rhetoric]], poetry and theatrical theory that was about the fitness or otherwise of a style to a theatrical subject. The concept of decorum is also applied to [[#Social decorum|prescribed limits of appropriate social behavior]] within set situations.

==In rhetoric and poetry==
In classical rhetoric and poetic theory, decorum designates the appropriateness of style to subject. Both [[Aristotle]] (in, for example, his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'') and [[Horace]] (in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'') discussed the importance of appropriate style in [[Epic poetry|epic]], [[tragedy]], [[comedy]], etc. Horace says, for example: "A comic subject is not susceptible of treatment in a tragic style, and similarly the banquet of [[Thyestes]] cannot be fitly described in the strains of everyday life or in those that approach the tone of comedy. Let each of these styles be kept to the role properly allotted to it."&lt;ref&gt;Horace. ''On the Art of Poetry''. Translated by T.S. Dorsch. In: ''Aristotle/Horace/Longinus: Classical Literary Criticism''. London: Penguin Books, 1965. p. 82 (corresponding to lines 81-106 in the Latin version). {{ISBN|0-14-044155-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hellenistic and Latin [[rhetor]]s divided style into: the grand style, the middle style and the low (or plain) style; certain types of vocabulary and diction were considered appropriate for each stylistic level. A discussion of this division of styles was set out in the pseudo-[[Cicero]]nian ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]''. Modeled on [[Virgil]]'s three-part literary career (''[[Bucolics]]'', ''[[Georgics]]'', ''[[Aeneid]]''), ancient, medieval and Renaissance theorists often linked each style to a specific [[genre]]: [[Epic poetry|epic]] (high style), [[didactic]] (middle style) and [[pastoral]] (plain style). In the Middle Ages, this concept was called "Virgil's wheel". For stylistic purists, the mixing of styles within a work was considered inappropriate, and a consistent use of the high style was mandated for the epic.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony James Boyle. ''Roman Epic.'' Routledge, 1993. p.6. {{ISBN|0-415-14357-8}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=iOMyLO_Etj8C Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; However, stylistic diversity had been a hallmark of classical epic (as seen in the inclusion of comic and/or erotic scenes in the epics of Virgil or Homer).
Poetry, perhaps more than any other literary form, usually expressed words or phrases that were not current in ordinary conversation, characterized as [[poetic diction]].

With the arrival of [[Christianity]], concepts of decorum became involved with those of the [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|sacred and profane]] in a different way from in the previous classical religions. Although in the [[Middle Ages]] religious subjects were often treated with broad humour in a "low" manner, especially in [[medieval drama]], the churches policed carefully the treatment in more permanent art forms, insisting on a consistent "high style". By the Renaissance the mixture of revived [[classical mythology]] and Christian subjects was also considered to fall under the heading of decorum, as was the increasing habit of mixing religious subjects in art with lively [[genre painting]] or portraiture of the fashionable. The Catholic [[Council of Trent]] [[The Reformation and art#Council of Trent|specifically forbade]], among other things, the "indecorous" in religious art.

Concepts of decorum, increasingly sensed as inhibitive and stultifying, were aggressively attacked and [[deconstruction|deconstructed]] by writers of the [[Modernism|Modernist movement]], with the result that readers' expectations were no longer based on decorum, and in consequence the violations of decorum that underlie the wit of [[mock-heroic]], of literary [[burlesque]], and even a sense of [[bathos]], were dulled in the twentieth-century reader.

==In theatre==
In continental European debates on theatre in the Renaissance and post-Renaissance, decorum is concerned with the appropriateness of certain actions or events to the stage. In their emulation of classical models and of the theoretical works by Aristotle and Horace (including the notion of the "[[Three Unities]]"), certain subjects were deemed to be better left to narration. In Horace's ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', the poet (in addition to speaking about appropriate vocabulary and diction, as discussed above) counseled playwrights to respect decorum by avoiding the portrayal, on stage, of scenes that would shock the audience by their cruelty or unbelievable nature: "But you will not bring on to the stage anything that ought properly to be taking place behinds the scenes, and you will keep out of sight many episodes that are to be described later by the eloquent tongue of a narrator. [[Medea]] must not butcher her children in the presence of the audience, nor the monstrous [[Atreus]] cook his dish of human flesh within public view, nor [[Procne]] be metamorphosed into a bird, nor [[Cadmus]] into a snake. I shall turn in disgust from anything of this kind that you show me. "&lt;ref&gt;Horace. ''On the Art of Poetry''. Translated by T.S. Dorsch. In: ''Aristotle/Horace/Longinus: Classical Literary Criticism''. London: Penguin Books, 1965. p. 85 (corresponding to lines 164-193 in the Latin version). {{ISBN|0-14-044155-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Renaissance Italy, important debates on decorum in theater were set off by [[Sperone Speroni]]'s play ''[[Canace (play)|Canace]]'' (portraying incest between a brother and sister) and [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi]]'s play ''[[Orbecche]]'' (involving patricide and cruel scenes of vengeance).&lt;ref&gt;See Timothy Reiss. "Renaissance theatre and the theory of tragedy." ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism.'' Volume III: The Renaissance. pp.229-247. {{ISBN|0-521-30008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In seventeenth-century France, the notion of decorum (''les bienséances'') was a key component of French classicism in both theater and the novel (see [[French literature of the 17th century]]), as well as the visual arts - see [[hierarchy of genres]].

==Social decorum==
''Social'' decorum sets down appropriate [[social behavior]] and propriety, and is thus linked to notions of [[etiquette]] and [[manners]].

The precepts of social decorum as we understand them, of the preservation of external decency, were consciously set by [[Philip Dormer Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]], who was looking for a translation of ''les moeurs'': "Manners are too little, morals are too much."&lt;ref&gt;Chesterfield, in the ''World'', 12 August 1756, noted by Watson 1947:197.&lt;/ref&gt; The word decorum survives in Chesterfield's severely reduced form as an element of etiquette: the prescribed limits of appropriate social behavior within a set situation. The use of this word in this sense is of the sixteenth-century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]]'s use of ''decorum'' in discussing virtue in ''De officiis'' does not distinguish it from ''honestum'', according to Melvin R. Watson, "Lord Chesterfield and 'Decorum'" ''Modern Language Notes'' '''62'''.3 (March 1947), pp. 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt; prescribing the boundaries established in drama and literature, used by [[Roger Ascham]], ''The Scholemaster'' (1570) and echoed in [[Malvolio]]'s tirade in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', "My masters, are you mad, or what are you? Have you no wit, manners nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night?...Is there no respect of persons, place nor time in you?"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kranidas, "Malvolio on Decorum" ''Shakespeare Quarterly'' '''15'''.4 (Autumn 1964, pp. 450-451) p 450; see also T. McAlindon, ''Shakespeare and Decorum'' (New York) 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The place of decorum in the courtroom, of the type of argument that is within bounds, remains pertinent:&lt;ref&gt;"Decorum of Attorney in Argument: Propriety of Appeals to the Pathetic or Sentimental" ''Michigan Law Review'' '''2'''.1 (June 1903), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; the decorum of argument was a constant topic during the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson trial]].

During [[Model United Nations]] conferences the honorable chair may have to announce, "Decorum delegates!" if delegates are not adhering to parliamentary procedure dictated by the rules. This often happens if a delegate speaks out of turn or if the delegation is being disruptive.

A '''Deviation survey'''[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=survey#2], more generally known in the [[oil industry]] as simply a 'survey', is the measurement of a [[borehole]]'s departure from the [[Vertical direction|vertical]], measured in [[Degree (angle)|degree]]s (°).

*When a ''well plan'' dictates the drilling of a straight [[borehole]], surveys are periodically taken to ensure that it will hit its target and also to ensure that it does not trespass underneath different property lines. These surveys can be taken fairly simply with a ''mechanical drift recorder'' more commonly known as a Totco or Totco barrel (named after the company that perfected the device). This device is run inside the [[drill string]] attached to a wire on a [[wireline (cabling)|wireline]] unit, down to the bottom of the drill pipe where the device (which is simply an inverted pendulum with a timer that punches a pin-hole onto a round paper tab delineated with concentric circles indicating increments of degrees) measures the angle of the hole and then is pulled back out to visually inspect to determine the angle. There are versions of this device that actually take a picture on film and are often used in situations where the [[azimuth]] (direction) needs to be determined also.
*When a ''well plan'' dictates a directional or horizontal borehole, more sophisticated tools are normally used. One such tool is the MWD (measurement while drilling) tool that uses electronic accelerometers and gyroscopes, to continually take surveys while drilling (as the name suggests) and also measures the [[azimuth]] (direction). This tool is attached to the [[drill string]] itself and requires extra support personnel to use and interpret the data, and its costs are much more substantial. ([[well logging|See well logging]])

'''Estonian grammar''' is the [[grammar]] of the [[Estonian language]].

==Grammatical processes==

===Consonant gradation===
{{also|Consonant gradation}}
Estonian [[consonant gradation]] is a grammatical process that affects obstruent consonants at the end of the stressed syllable of a word. Gradation causes consonants in a word to alternate between two ''grades'', termed "strong" and "weak", depending on the grammar. Some grammatical forms trigger the weak grade, while others have the strong grade. It is not predictable which form will have which grade; this must simply be memorised. Not all words show gradation. In particular, words with stems of three or more syllables generally do not gradate, nor do words with stems of one syllable.

Gradation correlates with the appearance of extra length on a syllable. When a syllable is long, the strong grade will always be accompanied by extra length. The weak grade may or may not have extra length, depending on other factors. These are mentioned at [[Estonian phonology#Suprasegmental length|Estonian phonology - Suprasegmental length]]. Some words show gradation only through the presence of absence or extra length, and the consonants themselves do not change. In this article, extra length is shown with a backtick ` before the vowel of the syllable.

The gradation patterns of geminate (long) consonants are relatively simple:
* Standing alone after a short vowel, the strong grade appears as a double voiceless consonant, while a single voiceless consonant appears in the weak grade.
* After a long vowel, or in a consonant cluster, the strong grade appears with a single voiceless consonant, while a voiced consonant appears in the weak grade.
* Long ''ss'' only gradates when it appears at the end of a cluster, with ''s'' appearing in the weak grade.

{| class="wikitable"
! Strong !! Weak !! Example
|-
| pp || p || s`e'''pp''' : se'''p'''a
|-
| tt || t || v`õ'''tt'''a : võ'''t'''an
|-
| kk || k || h`a'''kk'''ama : ha'''k'''ata
|-
| p || b || k`u'''p'''ja : ku'''b'''jas, k`il'''p''' : kil'''b'''i
|-
| t || d || s`aa'''t'''ev : saa'''d'''an, k`ar'''t'''ma : kar'''d'''an
|-
| k || g || v`il'''k'''uma : vil'''g'''un
|-
| ss || s || k`ir'''ss''' : kir'''s'''i
|}

Patterns for single plosives are more varied and unpredictable. The weak grade may involve disappearance of the consonant altogether, with further consequences for vowels and extra length.

{| class="wikitable"
! Strong !! Weak !! Example !! Notes
|-
| rowspan="2" | b || v || k`ae'''b'''ama : kae'''v'''ata ||
|-
| ∅ || tu'''b'''a : t`oa || When next to ''u''.
|-
| rowspan="2" | d, t || ∅ || `ae'''d''' : aia, l`eh'''t''' : lehe || Voiceless ''t'' appears in the cluster ''ht''.
|-
| j || ra'''d'''a : ra'''j'''a || When followed by ''a'' and preceded by a short vowel other than ''e'' or ''i''.
|-
| rowspan="2" | g, k || ∅ || `ar'''g''' : ara, lu'''g'''ema : l`oen, h`ah'''k''' : haha || Voiceless ''k'' appears in the clusters ''hk'' and ''sk''.
|-
| j || m`är'''g''' : mär'''j'''a || When followed by ''a'' or ''e'' and preceded by ''l'' or ''r'' which is preceded by ''e'', ''ä'' or ''ü''.
|}

There are also four special assimilative patterns:

{| class="wikitable"
! Strong !! Weak !! Example
|-
| mb || mm || h`a'''mb'''a : ha'''mm'''as
|-
| nd || nn || k`a'''nd'''ma : ka'''nn'''an
|-
| ld || ll || p`õ'''ld''' : põ'''ll'''u
|-
| rd || rr || k`o'''rd''' : ko'''rr'''a
|}

When a consonant is reduced to zero in the weak grade, this may cause the vowels of the two adjacent syllables to come together. These vowels undergo several changes:
* If the first vowel is long, it is shortened. Examples: ''r`oog'' : ''r`oa'', ''n`eedma'' : ''n`ean''.
* If either vowel is ''i'', ''u'' or ''ü'', it is lowered to ''e'', ''o'' or ''ö'' respectively. Examples: ''nuga'' : ''n`oa'', ''s`aagima'' : ''s`aen'', ''süsi'' : ''s`öe''.
* If the first vowel is a diphthong ending in ''e'', the ''e'' becomes ''j''. Examples: ''p`oeg'' : ''poja'', ''`aeglema'' : ''ajelda''.
* If the first vowel is a diphthong ending in ''u'', the ''u'' becomes ''v''. Examples: ''h`aug'' : ''havi''.
* If the first vowel is a diphthong ending in any other sound, the second vowel is removed if it is identical. Examples: ''t`eadma'' : ''t`ean'', ''l`iug'' : ''l`iu''.

===Assibilation===

Assibilation is a change that happened in Proto-Finnic: the sequence ''ti'' became ''si''. This change is no longer productive or predictable, but a fair number of nouns still display the effects in certain forms. The effect is visible in that sometimes ''s'' appears where there would otherwise be a ''t'' or ''d''. This also creates new variants of the gradation patterns mentioned above, with ''s'' appearing in some of the forms in both the strong and weak grade.

For example:
* ''käsi'', genitive singular ''käe'', illative singular ''kätte'', partitive plural ''käsi''.
* ''uus'', genitive singular ''uue'', illative singular ''uude'', partitive plural ''uusi''.
* ''vars'', genitive singular ''varre'', illative singular ''varde'', partitive plural ''varsi''.
* ''kaas'', genitive singular ''kaane'', illative singular ''kaande'', partitive plural ''kaasi''. Also an example of another change that happened in some words, in which ''n'' disappeared before ''s''. Consequently, there is no ''n'' in the forms that have assibilation.
* ''kolmas'', genitive singular ''kolmanda''. Here, too, ''n'' disappeared before ''s''.
* ''kaks'', genitive singular ''kahe'', illative singular ''kahte''. In this particular case, ''ht'' becomes ''ks'' where assibilation occurred.
* ''minema'', first-person singular present ''lähen'', first-person singular past ''läksin''. Same as above.

Inflectional endings as listed below are added to the stem of a noun, which is formed from:
* singular genitive: singular cases except nominative and partitive, plural nominative,
* singular partitive: plural genitive,
* plural genitive: plural cases except nominative and partitive.

Singular [[nominative]], singular [[genitive]] and singular [[partitive case|partitive]] are not predictable and have to be taken from the vocabulary ([[Estonian_language#Gradation|gradation]] may also apply).

Singular genitive always ends in vowel. When formed from a stem that ends in consonant, it can take the following endings: ''-a, -e, -i, -o, -u''.

Singular partitive can take the following endings: ''-d, -t, -a, -e, -i, -u''.

Plural partitive is formed from either singular genitive or singular partitive and can take the following endings (some words have two forms):
* ''-id'': one-syllable words with long vowels ''aa, ee, õõ, uu, öö, ää'', two-syllable words with long vowels or endings ''-em, -en, -el, -er, -ar, -ur, -e, -ne, -s'' or singular genitive with one or three syllables, three-syllable words with endings ''-ne, -s'',
* ''-sid'': one-syllable words with long vowels ''ii, üü'' or a diphthong, two-syllable words with short vowels, three-syllable words with endings ''-um, -on, -er, -ar, -är, -ov, -nna'',
* ''-e'': words with singular partitive endings ''-i, -u, -j'', or singular partitive ending ''-a'' with the preceding syllable containing ''u'',
* ''-i'': words with singular partitive ending ''-e'', or singular partitive ending on consonant with singular genitive ending ''-e'', or singular partitive ending ''-a'' with the preceding syllable containing vowels ''e, o, ä, ö, ü'' or a diphthong with one of these vowels as the first sound with the exception of ''ei, äi'',
* ''-u'': words with singular partitive ending ''-a'' with the preceding syllable containing vowels ''a, i, õ'' or diphthongs ''ei, äi''.

Singular illative has a short form in some words. It can take the following endings: ''-de'', ''-he'', ''-hu'', ''-a'', ''-e'', ''-i'', ''-u''. In case it takes the vowel ending, this vowel is the same as the ending vowel of the singular genitive form of the given word, but the vowel (if it is already long or a diphthong) or its preceding consonant (if the vowel is short and the consonant either short or long) is lengthened to the third degree and thus becomes overlong. If illative ends with ''-sesse'', then the short form is ''-sse''.

Plural illative, inessive, elative, allative, adessive, ablative, translative have a short form in some words. If the plural partitive ends with ''-id'', then the short plural stem is this form without ''-d'' (instead of plural genitive with ''-de-''); if it ends with a vowel, then the short plural stem is this form; if it ends with ''-sid'', then the short plural cannot be formed.

Emphasis: noun + ''-gi'' (after a final voiced consonant or vowel) / ''-ki'' (after a final voiceless consonant).

New nouns can be derived from existing nouns, adjectives and verbs using suffixes like ''-ja'' (agent, from ''-ma'' infinitive), ''-mine'' (gerund, from ''-ma'' infinitive), ''-la, -nna, -tar, -ur, -stik, -ndik, -nik, -ik, -k, -ng, -lane, -line, -kene, -ke, -e, -ndus, -dus, -us, -is, -kond, -nd, -istu, -u''.

[[Estonian locative system|Locative cases]] make up six or eight of these fourteen (depending on interpretation).

There are also some additional cases such as the [[prolative case|prolative]] (jalg'''si''', "by foot"; käsi'''tsi''', "by hand"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suoniemi-Taipale|first=Inga|title=Itaemerensuomalaisten kielten prolatiivi|journal=Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seuran Toimituksia|year=1994|series=616|url=http://www.suomalainen.com/fi/Itämerensuomalaisten-kielten-prolatiivi-sku-P9517178212|accessdate=17 April 2013|trans-title=Prolatives in Balto-Finnic Languages|publisher=University of Jyväskylä|language=Finnish|isbn=9517178212}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the similarly formed [[instructive case|instructive]] (meri'''tsi''', "by the way of the sea"), which are not traditionally counted among the 14 grammatical cases.

==Adjectives==

Inflectional endings as listed below are added to the stem of an adjective, which is formed like the one for nouns.

The stem for the comparative and superlative forms is the singular genitive of an adjective; if a word has two syllables in the genitive or a vowel following ''-ke(se)'', then ''-ke(se)'' is left out and the last vowel in the stem changes to ''-e''. The genitive and the partitive of the comparative itself are formed with ''-a'' and ''-at''.

New adjectives can be derived from existing words by means of suffixes like:&lt;br&gt;
: ''-v'' (active present participle, from ''-ma'' infinitive),
: ''-nud'' (active perfect participle, from ''-da'' infinitive),
: ''-tav'' (passive present participle, from ''-tud'' participle),
: ''-tud'' (passive perfect participle), and ''-lik, -line, -lane, -ne, -ke, -kas, -jas, -tu''.

Antonym can be formed by prepending ''eba'' or ''mitte'' to an adjective. ''Eba-'' is considered to be the only derivational prefix in Estonian; as ''mitte'' can also occur as a separate word, ''mitte'' + adjective can be regarded as a compound rather than derivative. Alternatively, for an adjective formed from a noun or a verb, an antonym can often be constructed using the suffix ''-tu'' or ''-matu''.

===Pro-adjectives===
* numeral (nominative - genitive - partitive, with noun in singular nominative for 1 and in singular partitive for others): ''null - nulli - nulli'' (0), ''üks - ühe - üht'' (1), ''kaks - kahe - kaht'' (2), ''kolm - kolme - kolme'' (3), ''neli - nelja - nelja'' (4), ''viis - viie - viit'' (5), ''kuus - kuue - kuut'' (6), ''seitse - seitsme - seitset'' (7), ''kaheksa - kaheksa - kaheksat'' (8), ''üheksa - üheksa - uheksat'' (9), ''kümme - kümne - kümmet'' (10), ''-teist(kümmend) - -teist(kümne) - -teist(kümmet)'' (11-19), ''-kümmend - -kümne - -kümmet'' (20-90), ''sada - saja - sadat'' (100), ''-sada - -saja - -sadat'' (200-900), ''- tuhat - - tuhande - - tuhandet'' (1.000-999.000), ''- miljon - - miljoni - - miljonit'' (1.000.000-999.000.000), ''- miljard - - miljardi - - miljardit'' (1.000.000.000); ordinal: ''esimene - esimese - esimest'' (1.), ''teine - teise - teist'' (2.), ''kolmas - kolmanda - kolmandat'' (3.), ''cardinal_genitive-s - cardinal_genitive-nda - cardinal_genitive-ndat'' (others)
* demonstrative (nominative - genitive - partitive, singular / plural): ''niisugune - niisuguse - niisugust'' (this kind), ''see - selle - seda / need - nende - neid'' (this/that), ''too - tolle - toda / nood - nonde - noid'' (yonder)
* interrogative (nominative - genitive - partitive): ''missugune - missuguse - missugust'' (what kind), ''milline - millise - millist'' (which)
* existential (nominative - genitive - partitive): ''mingisugune - mingisuguse - mingisugust'' (some kind), ''mõni - mõne - mõnda'' (some)
* free choice (nominative - genitive - partitive): ''mingisugune - mingisuguse - mingisugust'' (any kind), ''ükskõik milline - ükskõik millise - ükskõik millist'' (any)
* universal (nominative - genitive - partitive): ''kõik - kõige - kõike'' (every kind), ''iga - iga - iga'' (every)

* with the terminative case: ''kuni'' (until)
* with the abessive case: ''ilma'' (without)
* with the comitative case: ''koos / ühes'' (with)

==Verbs==
{{wiktionary|Appendix:Estonian conjugation}}
The inflectional endings as listed below are added to the stem of a verb, which is formed from:
* indicative mood active voice singular first person of positive present tense (by dropping ''-n''): indicative mood active voice of present tense, conditional mood active voice of present tense, imperative mood active voice singular second person of present tense,
* ''-ma'' infinitive (by dropping ''-ma''; if the stem ends with a consonant, an additional ''-i-'' is added in the singular third person of the imperfect or an additional ''-e-'' is added in the singular nominative of the participle, the consonant is doubled if it was short and preceding a short vowel; if the stem ends with ''-e'' while being two-syllable or if it ends with a long vowel, then the ''-s-'' is left out in all numbers and persons, ''ei'' is changed to ''i'', a long vowel becomes short and ''o, ö'' are changed to ''õ''): indicative mood active voice of positive imperfect, quotative mode active voice of present tense,
* ''-da'' infinitive (by dropping ''-da / -ta / -a''; long final ''l, r'' become short, in spoken language ''-nud'' is shortened to ''-nd''): indicative mood active voice of negative imperfect, indicative mood active voice of pluperfect, imperative mood active voice of present tense except singular second person, active voice of perfect,
* participle of passive voice perfect (by dropping ''-tud''): passive voice.

''-ma'' infinitive and ''-da'' infinitive are not predictable and have to be taken from the vocabulary. Present tense form and ''-tud'' participle are derived from the infinitives on the basis of [[Estonian_language#Gradation|gradation]].

''-ma'' infinitive is used after verbs of motion and after participles. It can be declined: ''-ma'' (illative), ''-mas'' (inessive), ''-mast'' (elative), ''-maks'' (translative), ''-mata'' (abessive).

''-da'' infinitive is used after verbs of emotion, after impersonal expressions, after ''et'' (in order to) and as a subject. It can be declined: ''-des'' (inessive).

Verb derivation: ''-ta-'' (transitive/passive), ''-u- / -i-'' (reflexive), ''-el- / -le-'' (reciprocal), ''-ne-'' (translative), ''-ata-'' ([[momentane]]), ''-el- / -skle-'' ([[frequentative]]), ''-tse-'' (continuous).

Emphasis: verb + ''-gi'' (after a final voiced consonant or vowel) / ''-ki'' (after a final voiceless consonant), verb + ''küll'' (positive), verb + ''mitte'' (negative).

==Adverbs==

Inflectional endings as listed below are added to the stem of an adverb, which is formed from:
* singular genitive of an adjective (''-sti, -ti, -ldi, -li, -kesi''): genetival type,
* singular ablative of an adjective (''-lt''; some are declinable in allative, adessive, ablative): ablatival type.

Some adverbs are special words - original or vestigial forms of an ancient instructive case.

[[Pro-form|Pro-adverbs]]
* demonstrative (illative/allative - inessive/adessive - elative/ablative): ''siia - siin - siit'' (here), ''sinna - seal - sealt'' (there), ''nüüd'' (now), ''siis'' (then), ''seega'' (thus), ''seepärast'' (therefore)
* interrogative (illative/allative - inessive/adessive - elative/ablative): ''kuhu - kus - kust'' (where), ''millal'' (when), ''kuidas'' (how), ''miks'' (why)
* existential (illative/allative - inessive/adessive - elative/ablative): ''kuhugi - kuskil - kuskilt'' (somewhere), ''kunagi'' (sometime), ''kuidagi'' (somehow)
* free choice (illative/allative - inessive/adessive - elative/ablative): ''ükskõik kuhu - ükskõik kus - ükskõik kust'' (anywhere), ''ükskõik millal'' (anytime), ''igatahes'' (anyhow)

==Syntax==

The neutral word order in Estonian is [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO). Conjunctions: ''aga'' (but), ''et'' (that), ''ja'' (and), ''kas'' (whether), ''kui'' (if), ''nagu'' (as), ''sest'' (because), ''või'' (or). Questions begin with an interrogative word (interrogative pro-forms or ''kas'' ([[yes-no question|yes/no-question]]), ''eks'' (yes-question), ''ega'' (no-question)), followed by the SVO word order (in spoken language, interrogative words are sometimes left out, but instead there is either a change in intonation or VSO word order); answers: ''jah/jaa'' (yes), ''ei'' (no). An adjective precedes the noun it modifies. An adverb of time precedes an adverb of place.

However, as one would expect from an [[agglutinative language]], the word order is quite free and non-neutral word order can be used to stress some parts of the sentence or in poetic text, as in [[Finnish grammar#Word order|Finnish grammar]]. For example, consider the sentence ''mees tappis karu'' which means ''(a/the) man killed (a/the) bear'' and uses the neutral SVO word order. The sentence can be rephrased using OVS word order as ''karu tappis mees'' — a normal Estonian sentence that could be more precisely translated as ''it was (a/the) man who killed the bear'', i. e. the sayer emphasizes that the killer was a man, probably assuming the listener knows that a bear was killed. The other four word orders (''tappis mees karu'', ''tappis karu mees'', ''mees karu tappis'', ''karu mees tappis'') are also possible in certain contexts, especially if more words are added to the three-word sentences.

Sometimes the form of the verb, nouns and adjectives in the sentence are not enough to determine the subject and object, e. g. ''mehed tapsid karud'' (''the men killed the bears'') or ''isa tappis karu''  (''father killed the bear'') — in the first sentence because in plural, the nominative case is used in Estonian both for subject and telic object, and in the second sentence because in singular, the nominative, genitive and partitive forms of the word ''isa'' are the same, as well as those of the word ''karu'' (unlike the word ''mees'' which has different forms: sg. nom. ''mees'', sg. gen. ''mehe'', sg. part. ''meest''). In such sentences, word order is the only thing that distinguishes the subject and the object: listener presumes that the former noun (''mehed'', ''isa'') is the subject and the latter (''karud'', ''karu'') is the object. In such situations, the sayer cannot interchange the subject and the object for emphasis (at least unless it is obvious from the context which noun is the subject).

'''Folco de Baroncelli-Javon''' (1 November 1869 &amp;ndash; 15 December 1943), was a French writer and cattle farmer.  As an influential ''[[Camargue cattle|gardian]]'' (a kind of Provençal [[cowboy]]), he is an important figure in the traditional lifestyle and culture of the [[Camargue]] region of southern France.

==Family and childhood==
Though born in [[Aix-en-Provence]], Falco de Baroncelli-Javon was baptised in [[Avignon]], where his parents lived.  He came from a [[Florence|Florentine]] family who had settled in [[Provence]] in the 15th century, occupying a building in the centre of Avignon then called the Baroncelli Palace (now the [[Palais du Roure]]).  His father's side of the family were of [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] origin and part of the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibelline]] tradition, and they were hereditary [[Marquis of Javon|Marquises of Javon]].  Though somewhat aristocratic, the family spoke [[Provençal (dialect)|Provençal]], which was rather controversial at a time when it was considered to be a language of the common people.

His brother was [[Jacques de Baroncelli]], later a famous film director, and his sister, Marguerite de Baroncelli-Javon, later became ‘queen’ of the Occitan cultural movement known as the [[Félibrige]], and married the post-impressionist painter [[Georges Dufrénoy]].

==Life in the Camargue==
In 1895, ''lou Marquès'' (‘the Marquis’), as he was then known, moved to the [[Camargue]] and raised a herd of cattle called the ''Manado sentanco'' (the ‘holy herd’) in [[Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer]].  He married the daughter of a [[Châteauneuf-du-Pape]] landowner, and had three daughters, but his wife did not take to the climate of the Camargue and their life together was patchy.  Nevertheless, he settled in Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer and became a tenant of a ''[[wikt:mas#French|mas]]'', or traditional ranch, called the ''Mas de l'Amarée''.

In 1905, when an American rodeo show visited [[Nîmes]], he met [[Joe Hammam]] and then [[Buffalo Bill]].  Becoming friendly, he offered the services of his ''gardians'', who took part in Buffalo Bill's cowboys-and-Indians displays.

In May 1908, he met [[Jeanne de Flandreysy]] and fell in love.  Their affair was short, but their friendship would remain an important part of Baroncelli's life.  After the war, it was she who encouraged him to start writing, and he became an important part of the resurgent Occitan literary movement associated with [[Frédéric Mistral]].  Baroncelli was deeply affected by the carnage of the [[First World War]], and became a fervent anti-militarist, later supporting a local Communist mayor.

Most importantly, perhaps, he played an active role in maintaining and fostering a native Camarguais culture.  He was involved in codifying the nascent ‘[[Bullfighting#French|course camarguaise]]’, or local style of bullfighting, in which the object was to snatch a rose from the bull's head.  He put a lot of effort into raising purebred [[Camargue bull]]s, and his bull ''Prouvenço'' was a particularly fiercesome and well-known example.

In 1909 he founded the Nacioun Gardiano (‘''gardian'' nation’) to preserve the traditions of the Camargue.&lt;ref name="modernprovencalliteratureroche"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roche|first1=Alphonse V.|title=Modern Provençal Literature|journal=Books Abroad|date=Spring 1954|volume=28|issue=2|pages=171–174|doi=10.2307/40092939|jstor=40092939|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, out of money, Baroncelli had to leave the ''Mas de l’Amarée''.  Locals offered him a patch of land nearby where he constructed a replica of his old ranch, calling it the ''Mas du Simbèu'' (‘sign, emblem’; also the name given to the chief bull of a herd).  Among other things, he became an important supporter of the [[Romani people|Romany]] people in this area, and counted many gypsies among his close friends.

The late 1930s were marked by a series of illnesses, and the outbreak of the Second World War would prove too disruptive for him.  His ranch was requisitioned by German troops in 1943, and the Marquis was evicted to Saintes-Maries.  Sick and disoriented, he finally died at [[Avignon]] in December 1943.

==Legacy==
The image which many in France have of the [[Camargue]] is essentially of the traditions and customs which Baroncelli worked for his whole life.  As a working ''gardian'', he was intimately involved with the [[Camargue horse]]s and [[Camargue bull]]s which are emblematic of the region.  And he also left an important body of writing describing the area, including Camarguais folktales published in the local dialect of [[Occitan language|Occitan]].  His writing and his work helped to give the area a sense of individual importance which it has maintained to this day.

'''Gallurese''' (''gadduresu'') is an [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] [[Romance languages|Romance]] [[lect]] spoken in the region of [[Gallura]], in the northeastern part of [[Sardinia]]. It is often considered a [[dialect]] of southern [[Corsican language|Corsican]], or even a transitional language between [[Corsican language|Corsican]] and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]].

Gallurese's morphology and vocabulary are close to those of [[Corsican language|Corsican]], in particular with the southern dialects of [[Sartene]] and [[Porto-Vecchio]], whereas its phonology and syntax are similar to those of Sardinian.&lt;ref name="Palau"&gt;[http://maxia-mail.doomby.com/medias/files/atti-convegno-palau-2014-def.pdf Atti Convegno Lingua Gallurese, Palau 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; One third of Gallurese vocabulary is also influenced by [[Logudorese dialect|Logudorese]] Sardinian, [[Catalan language|Catalan]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref name="Palau" /&gt;

The [[Sassarese language]], spoken in the area of [[Sassari]], shares similar transitional traits between [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]], Corsican and Sardinian.

== Typical constitutional elements of Gallurese ==
[[Image:Dialetti corsi.png|thumb|left|Corsican dialects, including Gallurese.]]
*the plural form of nouns in ''-i'' (''ghjanni'' or ''polti'' 'doors') are like in Corsican and Italian, and not as in ''-s'' like in Sardinian (''jannas'', ''portas''), French, Spanish, Catalan, etc.
* Latin 'll' has become ''-dd-'' (like ''casteddu, coraddu'' 'castle', 'coral'), the same as in Sardinian, southern Corsican and Sicilian (but ''castellu, corallu'' in northern Corsican);
*''-r-'' modified to ''-l-'' (''poltu'' 'port', while ''portu'' in Corsican and Sardinian);
*''-chj-'' and ''-ghj-'' sounds (''ghjesgia'' 'church', ''occhji'' 'eyes'), like in Corsican, while Sardinian is ''cresia, ogros''.
* articles ''lu'', ''la'', ''li'', like in ancient Corsican dialects (''u'', ''a'', ''i'' in modern Corsican, ''su'', ''sa'', ''sos'', ''sas'' in Sardinian);

== Relation to Corsican ==
Gallurese is classified by some linguists as a dialect of Corsican,&lt;ref&gt;Blasco Ferrer 1984: 180–186, 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Contini 1987: 1°, 500–503&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dettori 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and by others as a dialect of Sardinian.&lt;ref&gt;Loporcaro 2009: 159–167&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, a great deal of similarity exists between [[Corsican language|Southern Corsican dialects]] and Gallurese, while there is relatively more distance from the neighbouring [[Sardo logudorese|Sardinian varieties]].

The [[Sardinia#Government and politics|Regional Government of Sardinia]] has recognized Gallurese, along with [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]] as separate languages, distinct from [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.regione.sardegna.it/j/v/86?v=9&amp;c=72&amp;s=1&amp;file=1997026|title= Legge Regionale 15 ottobre 1997, n. 26|accessdate=2008-06-16|author=Autonomous Region of Sardinia|date=1997-10-15|pages=Art. 2, paragraph 4|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The most ancient literary sources in Gallurese date back to the early 17th century, mainly as poetry and religious odes. Some late Middle Age fragments suggest that the formation of the language could be dated to the early 15th century. The origin and the development of Gallurese are debated. [[Max Leopold Wagner]] and [[Maurice Le Lannou]] argued that successive migration waves from Southern [[Corsica]], promoted under the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] rule to repopulate an area devastated by famine and pandemics, were crucial in the formation of a slightly hybridized version of Corsican.

'''Garo''', or '''A·chik''' (the name in Garo), is a [[Sino-Tibetan]] language spoken in [[India]] in the [[Garo Hills]] districts of [[Meghalaya]], some parts of [[Assam]], and in small pockets in [[Tripura]]. It is also spoken in certain areas of the neighbouring [[Bangladesh]]. According to the 2001 census, there are about 889,000 Garo speakers in [[India]] alone; another 130,000 are found in [[Bangladesh]].

==Geographical distribution==
''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists the following locations for Garo.

*Garo Hills division, [[Meghalaya]]
*[[Goalpara district]], [[Kamrup district]], and [[Karbi Anglong district]], western [[Assam]]
*[[Kohima district]], Nagaland
*Udaipur subdivision, [[South Tripura district]], Tripura
*Kamalpur and Kailasahar subdivisions, [[North Tripura district]], Tripura
*Sadar subdivision, [[West Tripura district]], Tripura
*[[Jalpaiguri district]] and [[Koch Bihar district]], West Bengal

== Linguistic affiliation ==
Garo belongs to the [[Bodo–Garo languages|Bodo-Garo]] subgroup of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], which includes [[Sinitic languages]] like Mandarin and Cantonese. The Bodo-Garo subgroup is one of the longest recognised and most coherent subgroups of the Sino-Tibetan language family.&lt;ref&gt;(Joseph and Burling 2006: 1)&lt;/ref&gt; This includes languages such as Bodo, Kokborok, Tiwa, Deuri, Garo, Rabha, Atong, Ruga, and Koch. Being closely related to each other, these languages have many features in common; and one can easily recognise the similarities even from a surface-level observation of a given data of words from these languages.

== Orthography and standardisation ==
Towards the end of the 19th century, the American Baptist missionaries put the north-eastern dialect of Garo called A·we into writing, initially using the Bengali script. The reason for its selection out of many others was because the north-eastern region of Garo Hills was where rapid growth in the number of educated Garo people was taking place. Besides, the region was also where education was first imparted to the Garos. In course of time, the dialect became associated with educated culture. Today, a variant of the dialect can be heard among the speakers of Tura, a small town in the west-central part of Garo Hills, which is actually an Am·beng-speaking region. But with the migration of educated north-easterners to Tura due to the establishment of the political headquarters there, after Garo Hills came under the complete control of the British Government in 1873, the town saw a shift from its use of the native dialect to the dialect of the north-easterners. Tura also became the educational hub of Garo Hills, and in time a de facto standard developed from the north-eastern dialect (A·we) which gradually became associated with the town and the educated Garo speech everywhere ever since. As regards Garo orthography, basic Latin alphabet completely replaced the Bengali script only by 1924, although a Latin-based alphabet had already been developed by the American missionaries in 1902. The Latin-based Garo alphabet used today consists of 20 letters and a raised dot called "raka" (a symbol representing the glottal stop); the letters "f”, "q”, "v”, "x”, "y”, and "z” appear only in imported words. In Bangladesh, a variant of the Bengali script is still used alongside its Latin counterpart. Bengali and Assamese had been the mediums of instruction in educational institutions until 1924, and they have played a great role in the evolution of the modern Garo as we know it today. As a result, many Bengali and Assamese words entered the Garo lexicon. Since recently, there has also been a proliferation of English words entering the everyday Garo speech owing to media and the preference of English-medium schools over those conducted in the vernacular. Hindi is also making a slow but firm appearance in the language.

== Dialects ==
Here, the term 'dialect' is politically defined as a 'non-official speech variety'. The Garo language comprises dialects such as A·we, Am·beng/A·beng, Matchi, Dual, Chisak, Ganching, and a few others. Marak (2013:134–135) lists the following dialects of Garo and their geographical distributions.&lt;ref&gt;Marak, D. 2013. "Linguistic Ecology of Garo." In Singh, Shailendra Kumar (ed). ''Linguistic Ecology of Meghalaya''. Guwahati: EBH Publishers. {{ISBN|978-93-80261-96-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The '''Atong''' dialect is spoken in the South East of Garo Hills in the Simsang river valley. The majority of Atong speakers are concentrated in villages like Rongsu, Siju, Rongru A·sim, Badri, Chitmang.
*The '''Ruga''' dialect is spoken in a small area in the South Central part of Garo Hills in the Bugai river valley. Like Atong, Ruga is close to Koch and Rabha languages, and also to Atong than to the language of most Garos, but the shift to A·we and A·beng has gone farther along the Rugas than among the Atongs.
*The '''Chibok''' occupy the upper ridges of the Bugai River.
*The '''Me·gam''' occupy roughly the border between the Garo Hills and Khasi Hills.
*The '''A·beng''' dialect is spoken in a large area beginning from the west of Bugai River, Ranggira plateau to the valley in the west and north. It is spoken across the boundaries in Bangladesh and south and north bank of Assam.
*'''A·we''' is spoken in a large stretch of the Brahmaputra valley roughly from Agia, Goalpara, to Doranggre, Amjonga to the border of Kamrup.
*The '''Matabeng''' dialect is found in the Arbella plateau.
*'''Gara Ganching''' is spoken in the southern part of Garo Hills. Gara Ganching speakers have settled in the Dareng and Rompa river valley.
*'''Dual''' is spoken in Sibbari, Kapasipara villages in the valley of the Dareng River. These villages are situated in the southern part of Garo Hills. Some Dual speakers also have settled in the villages of Balachanda and Chandakona in the western foothills of Garo Hills.
*The '''Matchi-Dual''' dialect is spoken in the Williamnagar area, in the Simsang valley. This dialect is a mixture of Matchi and Dual dialects.
*The '''Kamrup''' dialect is spoken in the villages of Gohalkona, Hahim, Santipur, and Ukiam in [[Kamrup District]].

The speakers of these dialects can generally understand one another, although there are occasions where one who is unfamiliar with a dialect from another region requires explanation of certain words and expressions typical of that dialect. Research on the dialects of Garo, with the exception of A·we and Am·beng, is very much neglected; and many Garo dialects are being subsumed either the Standard or A·we or Am·beng. Although the de facto written and spoken standard grew out of A·we, they are not one and the same; there is marked variation in the intonation and the use of vocabulary between the two. It would be proper, therefore, to make a distinction between Standard A·we (spoken mainly in Tura) and Traditional A·we (still heard among the speakers in the north-eastern region of Garo Hills). There is also a great misconception among Garos regarding Atong, Ruga, and Me·gam. These languages are traditionally considered dialects of Garo. The speakers of Atong and Ruga languages are indeed Garos, ethnically; but their languages lack mutual intelligibility with the dialects of Garo and therefore linguistically distinct from the Garo language. Me∙gam (known to the Khasis as Lyngam/Lyngngam) is an Austroasiatic language closely related to Khasi. Since the Me∙gam speakers share a lot in common with the Garos culturally, the Garos misunderstand their language to be another dialect of their own.

== Status ==
Garo has been given the status of an associate official language (the main official being English) in the five Garo Hills districts of Meghalaya under the Meghalaya State Language Act, 2005.

The language is also used as the medium of instruction at the elementary stage in Government-run schools in the Garo Hills. Even at the secondary stage, in some schools, where English is the de jure medium of instruction, Garo is used alongside English – and sometimes even more than it – making the system more or less a bilingual one. In schools where English is the sole medium, Garo is taught only as a subject, as Modern Indian Language (M.I.L.). At the college level, students can opt for Garo Second Language (G.S.L.) besides the compulsory M.I.L. and even work towards a B.A. (Honours) in Garo.

In 1996, at the inception of its Tura campus, the [[North-Eastern Hill University]] established the Department of Garo, making it one of the first departments to be opened in the campus and "the only one of its kind in the world". The department offers M.A. and PhD programs in Garo.

Garo has been witnessing an immense growth in its printed literature lately. There has been an increase in the production of learning materials such as dictionaries, grammar and other text books, translated materials, newspapers, magazines and journals, novels, collection of short stories, folklores and myths, scholarly materials, and many important religious publications such as the Garo bible and the Garo hymnal. However, further research on the language itself has been slow – rather rare − but not non-existent.

== Phonology ==
While almost all other languages in the [[Bodo–Garo languages|Bodo–Garo]] sub-family contrast between low and high [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]]s, Garo is one of the sole exceptions. Wood writes that instead Garo seems to have substituted the tonal system by instead contrasting between syllables that end in a [[glottal stop]] and those that do not, with the glottal stop replacing the low tone.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Daniel Cody. 2008.

'''Georges Prosper Remi''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁəmi|lang}}; 22 May 1907&amp;nbsp;– 3 March 1983), known by the pen name '''Hergé''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛər|ˈ|ʒ|eɪ}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LPD|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|ɛʁʒe|lang}}), was a Belgian [[cartoonist]]. He is best known for creating ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', the series of [[comic album]]s which are considered one of the most popular [[European comics]] of the 20th century. He was also responsible for two other well-known series, ''[[Quick &amp; Flupke]]'' (1930–40) and ''[[The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko]]'' (1936–57). His works were executed in his distinct ''[[ligne claire]]'' drawing style.

Born to a lower middle-class family in [[Etterbeek]], Brussels, Hergé began his career by contributing illustrations to [[Scouting]] magazines, developing his first comic series, ''[[The Adventures of Totor]]'', for ''Le Boy-Scout Belge'' in 1926. Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper ''[[Le Vingtième Siècle]]'', he created ''The Adventures of Tintin'' in 1929 on the advice of its editor [[Norbert Wallez]]. Revolving around the actions of boy reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and his dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]], the series' early installments – ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'', and ''[[Tintin in America]]'' – were designed as conservative propaganda for children. Domestically successful, after serialisation the stories were published in book form, with Hergé continuing the series and also developing both the ''Quick &amp; Flupke'' and ''Jo, Zette and Jocko'' series for ''Le Vingtième Siècle''. Influenced by his friend [[Zhang Chongren]], from 1934 Hergé placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories, resulting in increased realism from ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'' onward. Following the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation of Belgium]] in 1940, ''Le Vingtième Siècle'' was closed but Hergé continued his series in ''[[Le Soir]]'', a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration.

After the Allied liberation of Belgium in 1944, ''Le Soir'' was shut down and its staff – including Hergé – accused of having been collaborators. An official investigation was launched, and while no charges were brought against Hergé, in subsequent years he repeatedly faced accusations of having been a traitor and collaborator. With [[Raymond Leblanc]] he established ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine in 1946, through which he serialised new ''Adventures of Tintin'' stories. As the magazine's artistic director, he also oversaw the publication of other successful comics series, such as [[Edgar P. Jacobs]]' ''[[Blake and Mortimer]]''. In 1950 he established [[Studios Hergé]] as a team to aid him in his ongoing projects; prominent staff members [[Jacques Martin (comics)|Jacques Martin]] and [[Bob de Moor]] greatly contributed to subsequent volumes of ''The Adventures of Tintin''. Amid personal turmoil following the collapse of his first marriage, he produced ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'', his personal favourite of his works. In later years he became less prolific, and unsuccessfully attempted to establish himself as an [[abstract art]]ist.

Hergé's works have been widely acclaimed for their clarity of draughtsmanship and meticulous, well-researched plots. They have been the source of a wide range of adaptations, in theatre, radio, television, cinema, and computer gaming. He remains a strong influence on the comic book medium, particularly in Europe.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=x}}{{sfn|London Review of Books|2012}} Widely celebrated in Belgium, a [[Musée Hergé|Hergé Museum]] was established in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] in 2009.

==Early life==

===Childhood: 1907–25===
[[File:Geburtshaus Hergé rue Philippe-Baucq 33.jpg|thumb|200px|The house in Etterbeek where Hergé was born]]

Georges Prosper Remi&lt;ref&gt;Opstal, H. van (1994) ''Essay RG. Het fenomeen Hergé'', pp. 8+10+132-133+195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goddin, Philippe (2008) ''Hergé. Levenslijnen'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  was born on 22 May 1907 in his parental home in [[Etterbeek]], Brussels, a central suburb in the capital city of Belgium.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=6}} His was a lower middle-class family.{{sfn|Sterckx|2015|p=11}} His [[Walloons|Walloon]] father, Alexis Remi, worked in a confectionery factory, whilst his [[Flemish people|Flemish]] mother, Elisabeth Dufour, was a housewife.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=3}} Married on 18 January 1905, they moved into a house at 25 rue Cranz (now 33 rue Philippe Baucq), where Hergé was born, although a year later they moved to a house at 34 rue de Theux.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=6}} His primary language was his father's French, but growing up in the bilingual Brussels, he also learned Dutch, developing a [[Marols|Marollien]] accent from his maternal grandmother.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=3|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=6–7}} A younger brother, Paul, was born five years after Hergé.{{sfn|Sterckx|2015|p=11}} Like most Belgians, his family belonged to the Roman Catholic Church, though they were not particularly devout.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=3|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2pp=18|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=8}} He later characterised his life in Etterbeek as dominated by a monochrome grey, considering it extremely boring.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=3–4|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=5}} Biographer [[Benoît Peeters]] suggested that this childhood melancholy might have been exacerbated through being sexually abused by a maternal uncle.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=14}}

Remi developed a love of cinema, favouring [[Winsor McCay]]'s ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' and the films of [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Harry Langdon]] and [[Buster Keaton]]; his later work in the comic strip medium displayed an obvious influence from them in style and content.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=7|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=7}} Although not a keen reader, he enjoyed the novels of British and American authors, such as ''[[Huckleberry Finn]]'', ''[[Treasure Island]]'', ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' and ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', as well as the novels of Frenchman [[Alexandre Dumas]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=5|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=12–13}} Drawing as a hobby, he sketched out scenes from daily life along the edges of his school books. Some of these illustrations were of German soldiers, because his four years of [[elementary education|primary schooling]] at the Ixelles Municipal School No. 3 coincided with the [[First World War]], during which Brussels [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|was occupied by the German army]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=6|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=8}} In 1919, his secondary education began at the secular Place de Londres in [[Ixelles]],{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=10–11}} but in 1920 he was moved to Saint-Boniface School, an institution controlled by the archbishop where the teachers were Roman Catholic priests.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=7}} Remi proved a successful student, being awarded prizes for excellence. He completed his secondary education in July 1925 as the top of his class.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=8|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=16}}

{{quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote=My childhood was extremely ordinary. It happened in a very average place, with average events and average thoughts. For me, the poet's "green paradise" was rather gray ... My childhood, my adolescence, Boy Scouting, military service—all of it was gray. Neither a sad boyhood nor a happy one—rather a lackluster one.|source=Hergé{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=5}}}}

Aged 12, Remi joined the [[Guidisme et Scoutisme en Belgique|Boy Scout]] brigade attached to Saint-Boniface School, becoming troop leader of the Squirrel Patrol and earning the name "Curious Fox" (''Renard curieux'').{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=8|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2pp=19|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=16}} With the Scouts, he travelled to summer camps in Italy, Switzerland, Austria and Spain, and in the summer of 1923 his troop hiked 200 miles across the Pyrenees.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=8|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=11–12}} His experiences with Scouting would have a significant influence on the rest of his life, sparking his love of camping and the natural world, and providing him with a [[moral compass]] that stressed personal loyalty and keeping one's promises.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=8–9}}

His Scoutmaster, Rene Weverbergh, encouraged his artistic ability, and published one of Remi's drawings in the newsletter of the Saint-Boniface Scouts, ''Jamais Assez'' (''Never Enough''): his first published work.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=9|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=16}} When Weverbergh became involved in the publication of ''Boy-Scout'', the newsletter of the Federation of Scouts, he published more of Remi's illustrations, the first of which appeared in the fifth issue, from 1922.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=9|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=16}} Remi continued publishing cartoons, drawings and woodcuts in subsequent issues of the newsletter, which was soon renamed ''Le Boy-Scout Belge'' (''The Belgian Boy Scout''). During this time, he experimented with different pseudonyms, using "Jérémie" and "Jérémiades" before settling on "Hergé", the French pronunciation of his reversed initials (R.G.) His work was first published under this name in December 1924.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=9|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2p=20|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=19}}

===''Totor'' and early career: 1925–28===
[[File:Totor the Boy Scout.gif|right|thumb|The ''Totor'' series was Hergé's first published comic strip.]]
Alongside his stand-alone illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began production of a comic strip for ''Le Boy-Scout Belge'', ''[[The Adventures of Totor|Les Aventures de Totor]]'' (''The Adventures of Totor''), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Hergé began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including [[speech bubbles]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=9|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=22}} Illustrations were also published in ''Le Blé qui lève'' (''The Wheat That Grows'') and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, ''The Soul of the Sea''.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=15|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=17}} Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived ''Atelier de la Fleur de Lys'' (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=18}}

After graduating from secondary school in 1925, Hergé enrolled in the École Saint-Luc art school, but finding the teaching boring, he left after one lesson.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=10|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=20}} He hoped for a job as an illustrator alongside Ickx at ''[[Le Vingtième Siècle]]'' (''The Twentieth Century'')—a conservative "Catholic Newspaper of Doctrine and Information"—but no positions were available. Instead he got a job in the paper's subscriptions department, starting in September 1925.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=11|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=20}} Despising the boredom of this position, he enlisted for military service before he was called up, and in August 1926 was assigned to the Dailly barracks at [[Schaerbeek]]. Joining the first infantry regiment, he was also bored by his military training, but continued sketching and producing episodes of ''Totor''.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=11|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=21–23}}

Toward the end of his military service, in August 1927, Hergé met the editor of ''Le Vingtième Siècle'', the Abbé [[Norbert Wallez]], a vocal fascist who kept a signed photograph of the Italian Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]] on his desk.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=11–13|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=27}} Impressed by Hergé's repertoire, Wallez agreed to give him a job as a photographic reporter and cartoonist for the paper, something for which Hergé always remained grateful, coming to view the Abbé as a father figure.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=12, 14–15|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=27–28}} Supplemented by commissions for other publications, Hergé illustrated a number of texts for "The Children's Corner" and the literary pages; the illustrations of this period show his interest in woodcuts and the early prototype of his ''ligne claire'' style.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=15–16|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=28–29}}

===Founding ''Tintin'' and ''Quick &amp; Flupke'': 1929–32===
Beginning a series of newspaper supplements in late 1928, Wallez founded a supplement for children, ''[[Le Petit Vingtième]]'' (''The Little Twentieth''), which subsequently appeared in ''Le Vingtième Siècle'' every Thursday.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=31–32}} Carrying strong Catholic and fascist messages, many of its passages were explicitly [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]].{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=38}} For this new venture, Hergé illustrated ''L'Extraordinaire Aventure de Flup, Nénesse, Poussette et Cochonnet'' (''The Extraordinary Adventure of Flup, Nénesse, Poussette and Cochonnet''), a comic strip authored by one of the paper's sport columnists, which told the story of two boys, one of their little sisters, and her inflatable rubber pig.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=16|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=12|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=32}} Hergé was unsatisfied, and eager to write and draw a comic strip of his own. He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium—such as the systematic use of speech bubbles—found in such American comics as [[George McManus]]' ''[[Bringing Up Father]]'', [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' and [[Rudolph Dirks]]'s ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]'', copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper's reporter [[Léon Degrelle]], stationed there to report on the [[Cristero War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=17|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=18|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3p=18}}

Hergé developed a character named [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] as a Belgian boy reporter who could travel the world with his [[fox terrier]], [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]]—"Milou" in the original French—basing him in large part on his earlier character of Totor and also on his own brother, Paul.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=19|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2p=25|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=34}} Degrelle later falsely claimed that Tintin had been based on him, while he and Hergé fell out when Degrelle used one of his designs without permission; they settled out-of-court.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=45–46|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=59–60}} Although Hergé wanted to send his character to the United States, Wallez instead ordered him to set his adventure in the [[Soviet Union]], acting as a work of anti-socialist propaganda for children. The result, ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', began serialisation in ''Le Petit Vingtième'' on 10 January 1929, and ran until 8 May 1930.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=22–23|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=34–37}} Popular in Francophone Belgium, Wallez organized a publicity stunt at the Gare de Nord station, following which he organized the publication of the story in book form.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=39–41}} The popularity of the story led to an increase in sales, and so Wallez granted Hergé two assistants, Eugène Van Nyverseel and Paul "Jam" Jamin.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=32–34|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=42–43}}

In January 1930, Hergé introduced ''[[Quick &amp; Flupke]]'' (''Quick et Flupke''), a new comic strip about two street kids from Brussels, in the pages of ''Le Petit Vingtième''.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2008|1p=95|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2pp=23–24|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=44–45}} At Wallez's direction, in June he began serialisation of the second Tintin adventure, ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'', designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the [[Belgian Congo]]. Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it would be accused of racism; however, at the time it was un-controversial and popular, with further publicity stunts held to increase sales.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=26–29|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=45–47}} For the third adventure, ''[[Tintin in America]]'', serialised from September 1931 to October 1932, Hergé finally got to deal with a scenario of his own choice, although he used the work to push an anti-capitalist, anti-consumerist agenda in keeping with the paper's ultra-conservative ideology.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=46–50|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2pp=30–32}} Although the ''Adventures of Tintin'' had been serialised in the French Catholic ''[[Cœurs Vaillants]]'' ("Brave Hearts") since 1930, he was soon receiving syndication requests from Swiss and Portuguese newspapers too.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=35}} Though wealthier than most Belgians at his age, and despite increasing success, he remained an unfazed "conservative young man" dedicated to his work.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=44|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=43, 48}}

Hergé sought work elsewhere too, creating ''[[Minor comics by Hergé#The Amiable Mr. Mops|The Lovable Mr. Mops]]'' cartoon for the [[Bon Marché]] department store,{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=49|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=25}} and ''[[Minor comics by Hergé#The Adventures of Tim the Squirrel out West|The Adventures of Tim the Squirrel Out West]]'' for the rival L'Innovation department store.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=46|2a1=Goddin|2y=2008|2p=89}} On 20 July 1932 he married [[Germaine Kieckens]], who was Wallez's secretary; although neither of them were entirely happy with the union, they had been encouraged to do so by Wallez, who demanded that all his staff married and who personally carried out the wedding ceremony at the Saint-Roch Church in [[Laeken]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=33–34|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=47–48}} Spending their honeymoon in [[Vianden]], [[Luxembourg]], the couple moved into an apartment in the rue Knapen, [[Schaerbeek]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=58}} After Wallez was removed from the paper's editorship in August 1933 following a scandal, Hergé became despondent; in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after his monthly salary was increased from 2000 to 3000 francs and his workload was reduced, with Jamin taking responsibility for the day-to-day running of ''Le Petit Vingtième''.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=40–41|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=60, 67–68}}

==Rising fame==

===''Tintin in the Orient'' and ''Jo, Zette &amp; Jocko'': 1932–39===
In November 1932 Hergé announced that the following month he would send Tintin on an adventure to Asia.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=62}}  Although initially titled ''The Adventures of Tintin, Reporter, in the Orient'', it would later be renamed ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]''. A mystery story, the plot began in Egypt before proceeding to Arabia and India, during which the recurring characters of [[Thomson and Thompson]] and [[Rastapopoulos]] were introduced.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=52–57|2a1 = Assouline|2y = 2009|2pp =42–44|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=62–65}} Through his friend Charles Lesne, Hergé was hired to produce illustrations for the company [[Casterman]], and in late 1933 they proposed taking over the publication of both ''The Adventures of Tintin'' and ''Quick and Flupke'' in book form, to which Hergé agreed; the first Casterman book was the collected volume of ''Cigars''.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=40–41, 44|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=57, 60}} Continuing to subsidise his comic work with commercial advertising, in January 1934 he also founded the "Atelier Hergé" advertising company with two partners, but it was liquidated after six months.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=49|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2pp=36–37|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=60–61}} From February to August 1934 Hergé serialised ''[[Popol Out West]]'' in ''Le Petit Vingtième'', a story using animal characters that was a development of the earlier ''Tim the Squirrel'' comic.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=73}}

From August 1934 to October 1935, ''Le Petit Vingtième'' serialised Tintin's next adventure, ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'', which was set in China and dealt with the recent [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]]. Hergé had been greatly influenced in the production of the work by his friend [[Zhang Chongren]], a Catholic Chinese student studying at Brussels' [[Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts]], to whom he had been introduced in May 1934. Zhang gave him lessons in Taoist philosophy, Chinese art and Chinese calligraphy, influencing not only his artistic style but also his general outlook on life.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=60–64|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2pp=51–59|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3pp=33–36|4a1=Assouline|4y=2009|4pp=48–55|5a1=Peeters|5y=2012|5pp=73–82}} As a token of appreciation Hergé added a fictional "[[Chang Chong-Chen]]" to ''The Blue Lotus'', a young Chinese boy who meets and befriends Tintin.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=60–64|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2pp=51–59|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3pp=33–36|4a1=Assouline|4y=2009|4pp=48–55|5a1=Peeters|5y=2012|5pp=73–82}} For ''The Blue Lotus'', Hergé devoted far more attention to accuracy, resulting in a largely realistic portrayal of China.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=60–64|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2pp=51–59|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3pp=33–36|4a1=Assouline|4y=2009|4pp=48–55|5a1=Peeters|5y=2012|5pp=73–82}} As a result, ''The Blue Lotus'' has been widely hailed as "Hergé's first masterpiece" and a benchmark in the series' development.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=51|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=35|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=82}} Casterman published it in book form, also insisting that Hergé include colour plates in both the volume and in reprints of ''America'' and ''Cigars''.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2008|1pp=182, 196|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=53|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=79–80}} In 1936, they also began production of Tintin merchandise, something Hergé supported, having ideas of an entire shop devoted to ''The Adventures of Tintin'', something that would come to fruition 50 years later.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=55|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=96}} Nevertheless, while his serialised comics proved lucrative, the collected volumes sold less well, something Hergé blamed on Casterman, urging them to do more to market his books.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=94}}

[[File:Jo Zette Jocko in Coeurs Vaillants.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Jo, Zette and Jocko'' in ''[[Cœurs Vaillants]]'']]
Hergé's next Tintin story, ''[[The Broken Ear]]'' (1935–37), was the first for which the plot synopsis had been outlined from the start, being a detective story that took Tintin to South America. It introduced the character of [[General Alcazar]], and also saw Hergé introduce the first fictional countries into the series, San Theodoros and Nuevo Rico, two republics based largely on Bolivia and Paraguay.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=68–73|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2pp=61–69|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3pp=37–39|4a1=Assouline|4y=2009|4pp=55–57|5a1=Peeters|5y=2012|5pp=82–84}}
The violent elements within ''The Broken Ear'' upset the publishers of ''[[Cœurs Vaillants]]'', who asked Hergé to create a more child-appropriate story for them. The result was ''The Adventures of Jo, Zette, and Jocko'', a series about a young brother and sister and their pet monkey.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=86–87}} The series began with ''The Secret Ray'', which was serialised in ''Cœurs Vaillants'' and then ''Le Petit Vingtième'', and continued with ''The Stratoship H-22''.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=87}} Hergé nevertheless disliked the series, commenting that the characters "bored me terribly."{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=88}} Now writing three series simultaneously, Hergé was working every day of the year, and felt stressed.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=91}}

The next Tintin adventure was ''[[The Black Island]]'' (1937–38), which saw the character travel to Britain to battle counterfeiters and introduced a new antagonist, the German Dr. Müller.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=76–80|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2pp=71–78|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3pp=39–42|4a1=Assouline|4y=2009|4pp=58–59|5a1=Peeters|5y=2012|5p=91}} Hergé followed this with ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'' (1938–39), in which Tintin saves the fictional Eastern European country of Syldavia from being invaded by its expansionist neighbour, Borduria; the event was an anti-fascist satire of [[Nazi Germany]]'s expansion into Austria and Czechoslovakia.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=82–86|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2pp=81–89|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3pp=42–44|4a1=Assouline|4y=2009|4pp=61–63|5a1=Peeters|5y=2012|5pp=97–101}} In May 1939, Hergé moved to a new house in [[Watermael-Boitsfort]],{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=102}} although following the German [[invasion of Poland]], he was conscripted into the Belgian army and temporarily stationed in [[Herenthout]]. Demobbed within the month, he returned to Brussels and adopted a more explicit anti-German stance when beginning his next Tintin adventure, ''[[Land of Black Gold]]'', which was set in the Middle East and featured Dr. Müller sabotaging oil lines.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=63|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=102–103}}

During this period, Hergé also contributed to ''L'Ouest'' (''The West''), a newspaper run by his friend [[Raymond De Becker]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=103–4}} ''L'Ouest'' urged Belgium to remain neutral in [[World War II]], a stance Hergé supported, creating the ''Mr Bellum'' strip to argue this position.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=64–65|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=103–104}} Hergé was invited to visit China by Chinese Nationalist leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]], who had enjoyed ''The Blue Lotus'', although due to the political situation in Europe, this was not possible.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=63–64|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=105–106}} He was re-mobilized in December, and stationed in [[Antwerp]], from where he continued to send the Tintin strip to ''Le Petit Vingtième''. However, he fell ill with [[sinusitis]] and [[boils]] and was declared unfit for military service in May 1940. That same day, [[Battle of Belgium|Germany invaded Belgium]]. ''Le Vingtième Siècle'' was shut down, part way through the serialisation of ''Land of Black Gold''.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=63, 65|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=106–107}}

{{quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=It is certain that Raymond De Becker sympathized with the National Socialist system, and on this point he was in agreement with [[Henri De Man]].

As the Belgian army clashed with the invading Germans, Hergé and his wife fled by car to France along with tens of thousands of other Belgians, first staying in [[Paris]] and then heading south to [[Puy-de-Dôme]], where they remained for six weeks.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=66|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=111–112}} On 28 May, Belgian King [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]] [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|surrendered the country to the German army]] to prevent further killing; a move that Hergé supported. He followed the king's request that all of those Belgians who had fled the country return, arriving back in Brussels on 30 June.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=67|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=112–113}} There, he found that his house had been occupied as an office for the German army's ''[[Propagandastaffel]]'', and also faced financial trouble, as he owed back taxes yet was unable to access his financial reserves.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=68|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=113–114}} All Belgian publications were now under the control of the German occupying force, who refused {{lang|fr|Le Petit Vingtième}} permission to continue publication.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=68–69|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=114}} Instead, Hergé was offered employment as a cartoonist for {{lang|fr|[[Le Pays Réel]]}} by its editor, the [[Rexist]] [[Victor Matthys]]; however, Hergé perceived {{lang|fr|Le Pays Réel}} as an explicitly political publication, and thus declined the position.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=114–115}}

[[File:Avenue Delleur 17.JPG|thumb|Hergé's house in Avenue Delleur 17 where he lived between 1939 and 1953]]
Instead, he took up a position with {{lang|fr|[[Le Soir]]}}, Belgium's largest Francophone daily newspaper. Confiscated from its original owners, the German authorities had permitted ''Le Soir'' to be re-opened under the directorship of De Doncker, although it remained firmly under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing anti-Semitism.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=70–71|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=116–118}} After joining the ''Le Soir'' team on 15 October, Hergé was involved in the creation of a children's supplement, ''Soir-Jeunesse'', aided by Jamin and [[Jacques Van Melkebeke]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=72|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=120–121}} He relaunched ''The Adventures of Tintin'' with a new story, ''[[The Crab with the Golden Claws]]'', in which Tintin pursued drug smugglers in North Africa; the story was a turning point in the series for its introduction of [[Captain Haddock]], who would become a major character in the rest of the ''Adventures''.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=124–126}} This story, like the subsequent ''Adventures of Tintin'' published in ''Le Soir'', would reject the political themes present in earlier stories, instead remaining firmly neutral.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=98–99|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=122}} Hergé also included new ''Quick &amp; Flupke'' gags in the supplement, as well as illustrations for serialised stories by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and the [[Brothers Grimm]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=73–74|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=122}}

In May 1941, a paper shortage led to the ''Soir-Jeunesse'' being reduced to four pages, with the length of the Tintin strip being cut by two thirds. Several weeks later the supplement disappeared altogether, with ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' being moved into ''Le Soir'' itself, where it became a daily strip.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=125}} While some Belgians were upset that Hergé was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying Nazi administration,{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2009|1p=73|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=72}} he was heavily enticed by the size of {{lang|fr|Le Soir}}'s readership, which reached 600,000.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=73|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|p=121}}
With Van Melkebeke, Hergé put together two Tintin plays. The first, ''Tintin in the Indies'', appeared at Brussels' Theatre des Galeries in April 1941, while the second, ''Mr Boullock's Disappearance'', was performed there in December.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=109–110|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=86|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=130–131}} From October 1941 to May 1942, ''Le Soir'' serialised Hergé's next Tintin adventure, ''[[The Shooting Star]]'', followed by publication as a single volume by Casterman. In keeping with ''Le Soir'''s editorial standpoint, ''The Shooting Star'' espoused an anti-Semitic and anti-American attitude, with the antagonist being a wealthy Jewish American businessman; it would thus prove particularly controversial in the post-war period, although Hergé denied any malicious anti-Semitic intention.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=106–109|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2pp=48–51|3a1=Assouline|3y=2009|3pp=80–83|4a1=Peeters|4y=2012|4pp=130–135}}

[[File:Galerie de Traitres - Hergé.JPG|thumb|left|Booklet published by the [[Belgian Resistance|resistance]] group ''L'Insoumis'', denouncing Georges Remy {{sic}} as a collaborator. Hergé later admitted that "I hated the Resistance thing ... I knew that for every one of the Resistance's actions, hostages would be arrested and shot."{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=150}}]]

Casterman felt that the black-and-white volumes of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' were not selling as well as colour comic books, and thus that the series should be produced in colour. At the same time, Belgium was facing a paper-shortage, with Casterman wishing to cut down the volumes from 120-pages in length to 62. Hergé was initially sceptical, but ultimately agreed to their demands in February 1942.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2009|1p=95|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=136–137}} For these new editions, Casterman introduced a four-colour system, although Hergé insisted that colour should remain secondary to line, and that it would not be used for shading.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=137}}
To cope with this additional workload, Hergé approached a friend whom he had met through Van Melkebeke, [[Edgar P. Jacobs]], to aid him as a cartoonist and colourist.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=86–87|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=138–139}} Jacobs could only work on the project part time, and so in March 1942 Hergé also employed a woman named Alice Devos to aid him.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2009|1p=96|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=86|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=139}} In July 1942, Hergé then procured an agent, Bernard Thièry, who took 40% of his commissions; their working relationship would be strained.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=85|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=131}} With their assistance, from 1942 to 1947, Hergé adapted most of his previous ''Adventures of Tintin'' into 62-page colour versions.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=140}}

Hergé's next ''Adventure of Tintin'' would be ''[[The Secret of the Unicorn]]'', serialised in ''Le Soir'' from June 1942.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=52}} He had collaborated closely with Van Melkebeke on this project, who had introduced many elements from the work of [[Jules Verne]] into the detective story, in which Tintin and Haddock searched for parchments revealing the location of hidden pirate treasure.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=143–144}} ''The Secret of the Unicorn'' marked the first half of a story arc that was completed in ''[[Red Rackham's Treasure]]'', serialised in ''Le Soir'' from February 1943; in this story, Tintin and Haddock search for the pirate's treasure in the Caribbean, with the character of [[Professor Calculus]] being introduced to the series.{{sfnm|1a1=Lofficier|1a2=Lofficier|1y=2002|1pp=52–53}} Following ''Red Rackham's Treasure'', Hergé drew illustrations for a serialised story titled ''Dupont et Dupond, détectives'' ("Thomson and Thompson, Detectives"), authored by the newspaper's crime editor, Paul Kinnet.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2008|1pp=128, 130|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=94}}

In September 1943, De Becker was removed as editor of ''Le Soir'' for stating that although the Nazis were motivated "by undoubted good will, [they were also] extremely out of touch with reality"; although Hergé was close to De Becker, he decided to remain at the newspaper, which came under the editorship of Max Hodeige.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=93|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=149–150}}
In autumn 1943, Hergé had decided that he wanted Jacobs to collaborate with him on ''The Adventures of Tintin''. Although initially hesitant, Jacobs eventually agreed, adopting the paid position in January 1944.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=98|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=152}} Jacobs and Hergé became close collaborators and greatly influenced each other, while together they developed the plot for the next ''Adventure of Tintin'', ''[[The Seven Crystal Balls]]'',{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=153}} which began serialisation in ''Le Soir'' in December 1943.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=124|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=118|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3p=55|4a1=Assouline|4y=2009|4pp=98–99}}

===Post-war controversy: 1944–46===

[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 BU769.jpg|thumb|The Allied liberation of Belgium in September 1944 brought problems for Hergé.]]

As the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops liberated Brussels from German occupation, ''Le Soir'' ceased publication on 2 September 1944, partway through its serialisation of ''The Seven Crystal Balls''.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=116}} Hergé was arrested on 3 September, having been named as a [[Collaborationism|collaborator]] in a Resistance document known as the "Gallery of Traitors".{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=195|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=159}} This would be the first of four incidents in which Hergé was arrested – by the State Security, the Judiciary Police, the [[Belgian National Movement]], and the [[Front de l'Indépendance|Front for Independence]] respectively – during the course of which he spent one night in jail.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=126|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2pp=117–118|3a1=Assouline|3y=2009|3p=106|4a1=Peeters|4y=2012|4p=159}} On 5 September the entire staff of ''Le Soir'' were fired and a new editorial team introduced,{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=116}} while on 8 September the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) issued a proclamation announcing that "any journalist who had helped produce a newspaper during the occupation was for the time being barred from practising his profession."{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=116|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=160}} Blacklisted, Hergé was now unemployed.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=106}} Further, he was publicly lampooned as a collaborator by a newspaper closely associated with the Belgian Resistance, ''La Patrie'', which issued a satirical strip titled ''The Adventures of Tintin in the Land of the Nazis''.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=127|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=118|3a1=Assouline|3y=2009|3p=106|4a1=Peeters|4y=2012|4p=160}}

The period witnessed widespread recriminations against accused collaborators, with military courts condemning 30,000 on minor charges and 25,000 on more serious charges; of those, 5,500 were sentenced to life imprisonment or [[capital punishment]].{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=107}} A judiciary inquiry into Hergé's case was launched by the deputy public prosecutor, Mr Vinçotte, although in his report he urged lenience, stating that "I am inclined to close the case. I believe it would bring ridicule on the judicial system to go after an inoffensive children's book author and illustrator. On the other hand, Hergé worked for ''Le Soir'' during the war, and his illustrations are what made people buy the newspaper."{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=108–109}} Although unable to work for the press, Hergé continued to re-draw and colour the older ''Adventures of Tintin'' for publication in book form by Casterman, completing the second version of ''Tintin in the Congo'' and starting on ''King Ottokar's Sceptre''.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=118|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=108|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=162}} Casterman supported Hergé throughout his ordeal, for which he always remained grateful.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=162}} Attempting to circumvent his blacklisting, with Jacobs he began producing comics under the anonymous pseudonym of "Olav", but upon sending them to publishers found none who would accept them.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=126|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=162}} Although this period allowed him an escape from the pressure of daily production which had affected most of his working life,{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=118}} he also had family problems to deal with; his brother Paul returned to Brussels from a German [[prisoner of war camp]], although their mother had become highly delusional and was moved to a [[psychiatric hospital]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=163–164}}

{{quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote=[During the occupation] I worked, just like a miner, a tram driver or baker! But, while one found it normal for an engineer to operate a train, members of the press were labelled as 'traitors'.|source= —Hergé{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=118}} }}

In October 1945, Hergé was approached by [[Raymond Leblanc]], a former member of a conservative Resistance group, the [[Mouvement National Royaliste|National Royalist Movement]], and his associates André Sinave and Albert Debaty. The trio were planning on launching a weekly magazine for children, and Leblanc – who had fond childhood memories of ''Tintin in the Land of the Soviets'' – thought Hergé would be ideal for it.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=109|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=164–165}} Hergé agreed, and Leblanc obtained clearance papers for him, allowing him to work.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=110}} Concerned about the judicial investigation into Hergé's wartime affiliations, Leblanc convinced William Ugeux, a leader of the Belgian Resistance who was now in charge of censorship and certificates of good citizenship, to look into the comic creator's file. Ugeux concluded that Hergé had been "a blunderer rather than a traitor" for his work at ''Le Soir''.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=111–112}} The decision as to whether Hergé would stand trial belonged to the general auditor of the Military Tribunal, Walter Jean Ganshof van der Meersch. He closed the case on 22 December 1945, declaring that "in regard to the particularly inoffensive character of the drawings published by Remi, bringing him before a war tribunal would be inappropriate and risky".{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=111–113}}

Now free from threat of prosecution, Hergé continued to support his colleagues at ''Le Soir'' who were being charged as collaborators; six of them were sentenced to death, and others to lengthy prison sentences.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=118|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=167}} Among those sentenced to death was Hergé's friend, Jamin, although his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=168}} In May 1946, Hergé was issued a certificate of good citizenship, which became largely necessary to obtain employment in post-war Belgium.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=113|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=167}} Celebrations were marred by his mother's death in April 1946; she was aged 60.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=113|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=169}}
[[Harry Thompson]] has described this post-war period as the "greatest upheaval" of Hergé's life.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=124}} Hergé later described it as "an experience of absolute intolerance. It was horrible, horrible!"{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=113–114|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=161}} He considered the post-war trials of alleged collaborators a great injustice inflicted upon many innocent people,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=161}} and never forgave Belgian society for the way that he had been treated, although he hid this from his public persona.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=113}}

==Later life==

===Establishing ''Tintin'' magazine: 1946–49===

[[File:Journal de Tintin Le Temple du Soleil.jpg|thumb|upright|300px|The first issue of ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine included an image based upon ''Prisoners of the Sun''.]]

Sinave devised the idea of naming their new magazine ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'', believing that this would attract a wide audience.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=165}} The Dutch-language edition produced for release in Belgium's Flemish north was titled ''Kuifje'' after the character's Dutch-language name.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=124|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=173}} Adopting the slogan of "The Newspaper for the Young Aged 7 to 77",{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=124}} the magazine also used a logo featuring the Tintin character himself.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=122}}
The [[Capital (economics)|capital]] for the project had been put up by those involved: as executive director, Leblanc provided 50%, while its managing director Georges Lallemand provided 40% and Hergé, its artistic director,  provided 10%.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=120}} Hergé assembled a group of associates to aid him, including Van Melkebeke, Jacobs, Paul Cuvelier, and Jacques Laudy.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=120–121|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=171}}
Van Melkebeke was initially appointed editor-in-chief, although he was arrested for having worked for the collaborationist ''Le Nouveau journal'' shortly after, with his involvement in the project thus being kept secret so as to avoid further controversy.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=118–119|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=172, 175}} Van Melkebeke continued to provide work for the magazine under pseudonyms, although this ceased during his imprisonment from December 1947 to October 1949.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=175–176, 186}}

The first issue of ''Tintin'' magazine was published on 26 September 1946.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=120|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=173}} Hergé was assigned to produce a two-page spread each week, and began by concluding ''The Seven Crystal Balls'' before embarking on its successor story, ''[[Prisoners of the Sun]]''.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=124}}  Alongside Hergé's ''Adventures of Tintin'', the magazine also included Laudy's ''The Legend of the Four Aymon Brothers'' and Jacobs' ''[[The Secret of the Swordfish]]'', the first in his new ''[[Blake and Mortimer]]'' series.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=122}} While the magazine was in competition with a number of rivals, most notably ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'', famous for serialising the ''[[Lucky Luke]]'' and ''[[Buck Danny]]'' comics,{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=121}} it proved an immediate success, with 60,000 copies being sold in three days of its release.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=122}} Its publication resulted in a massive boost to Hergé's book sales too.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=124}}

In 1947 [[The Crab with the Golden Claws (film)|a Belgian film adaptation]] of ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' was produced, and believing that cinematic adaptations were a good way to proceed, Hergé contacted [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney Studios]] in the United States; they declined his offer to adapt ''The Adventures of Tintin'' for the silver screen.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=133|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=187–189}}
In May 1947 the artistic collaboration between Hergé and Jacobs ended after an argument. Hergé had been jealous of the immediate success of Jacobs' ''Blake and Mortimer'' series, and had turned down Jacobs' request that he be credited as co-creator of the new ''Adventures of Tintin''.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=126–127|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=176–177}} That same month, Hergé broke from his manager, Thiery, after discovering that the latter had been siphoning off money for himself.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=179}}

Many Belgians were highly critical of the magazine due to its connections with Hergé, who was still deemed a collaborator and traitor by many; ''La Soir'' and ''La Cité'' publicly criticised the decision without referring to him by name while ''Le Quotidien'' and ''[[Communist Party of Belgium|Le Drapeau Rouge]]'' specifically singled him out for denunciation.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=122–123}} Hergé believed that the children's author [[Jeanne Cappe]] was behind many of these accusations, and threatened her with a lawsuit.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=130–131}} Unhappy with life in Belgium, Hergé made plans to emigrate to Argentina, a nation that was welcoming many Europeans who had supported the defeated Axis powers and which had a thriving comic book scene. Ultimately, he changed his mind, for reasons that have remained unknown; it is possible that he was unable to secure any promise of work in the South American country.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=131, 134|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=190–193}}

{{quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote=I've just discovered ... that Tintin is no longer me, and that though he continued to live it is through a sort of artificial respiration that I must keep up constantly, and that is exhausting me more and more.|source= —Hergé, in a letter to his wife, 1947{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=2012|1p=183}} }}

In May, Hergé and Germaine holidayed near to [[Gland, Switzerland|Gland]] on [[Lake Geneva]], Switzerland, where they were accompanied by a friend of theirs, a young woman named Rosane. During the holiday, Hergé and Rosane embarked on an extra-marital affair. He felt guilty, and returned to Brussels in June.{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=193}} Privately, he expressed the view that he had been led to commit such an act, which he viewed as immoral, through the influence of "amoral friends" that he was associating with.{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=194}} Hoping to reignite the passion and stability of his marriage, he arranged for him and Germaine to return to Switzerland soon after; here they argued, and embarked on a temporary separation.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=194}} Remaining in Switzerland, he visited King Leopold III, who was then holidaying in [[Pregny-Chambésy|Prégny]],{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=198}} before briefly returning to Brussels in July.{{Sfn|Peeters|2012|p=201}} Back in Switzerland, he embarked on an affair with a married woman, although again informed Germaine before setting off to spend time in [[Ardenne]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=201–202}} In August, the couple sought to reunite by holidaying together in [[Brittany]], but there they broke up again and Hergé returned to his lover in Switzerland.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=202–203}} In September he finally returned to Brussels,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=203}} but with his close friend Marcel Dehaye then spent time in a retreat at the [[Scourmont Abbey|Abbey of Notre-Dame-de-Scourmont]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=127–129|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=204–205}} That month, he revived ''Land of Black Gold'' – the ''Adventure of Tintin'' that had been interrupted by the German invasion of 1940 – and began serialising it in ''Tintin'' magazine.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=59}} However, the story was again interrupted, this time for twelve weeks as Hergé took a further unannounced holiday to Gland, greatly annoying many of his colleagues.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=210–214}}

Although they retained respect for each other, Hergé's repeated absences had created a tense situation between himself and Leblanc.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=214}} After a lengthy search, Leblanc had found a publisher willing to produce an edition of ''Tintin'' magazine in France: Georges Dargaud's [[Le Lombard]], which began production of a French edition in October 1948.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=131|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=203}} However, Hergé was unhappy that Leblanc had appointed André Frenez as Van Melkebeke's replacement as editor-in-chief, describing Frenez as "a cold functionary".{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=142}} Hergé was stubborn and uncompromising as the magazine's artistic director, known for strongly criticising the work of old friends like Pierre Ickx if he felt that they did not meet his exacting standards.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=139}} He was particularly critical of the work of two of the newly hired staff at ''Tintin'' and ''Kuifje'', [[Jacques Martin (comics)|Jacques Martin]] and [[Willy Vandersteen]], encouraging them to change their artistic style to better reflect his own preferences.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=215}} To Leblanc, he expressed the concern that most of those working at ''Tintin'' were better illustrators than storytellers.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=169|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=237}} He also opined that ''Tintin'' was not keeping up with the times and what he perceived as the increased maturity of children, encouraging the magazine to better reflect current events and scientific developments.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=235–237}}

===Studios Hergé and Fanny Vlamynck: 1950–65===

On 6 April 1950 Hergé established [[Studios Hergé]] as a [[public company]].{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=141|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=147|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=226}} The Studios were based in his Avenue Delleur house in Brussels,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=226}} with Hergé making a newly purchased country house in [[Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve|Céroux-Mousty]] his and Germaine's main abode.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=229}}
The Studios would provide both personal support to Hergé and technical support for his ongoing work.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=148}}
Initially with only three employees, this would rise to fifteen, with all working on Hergé's projects.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=149}} He hired [[Bob de Moor]] as his primary apprentice at the Studios in March 1951.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=152–153|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=231}} Impressed by Jacques Martin's work on ''The Golden Sphinx'', Hergé persuaded Martin to join the Studios in January 1954; Martin insisted on bringing with him his own two assistants, [[Roger Leloup]] and Michel Demaurets.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=153|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=249–250}}
During the early 1950s, a number of those convicted for collaborating with the Nazi occupiers were freed from prison. Sympathetic to their plight, Hergé lent money to some and aided others in getting jobs at ''Tintin'' magazine, much to Leblanc's annoyance.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=149–150|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=233–234}} For instance, as well as lending him money, Hergé used his connections to secure Raymond de Becker a job in Switzerland as a book shop sales inspector.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=150|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=234–235}} He also hired those associated with collaboration for his Studios; his new colourist, Josette Baujot, was the wife of a recently assassinated member of the [[Walloon Legion]],{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=149|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=250}} and his new secretary, Baudouin van der Branden de Reeth, had served a prison sentence for working at ''Le Nouveau Journal'' during the occupation.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=150|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=248}}

Hergé had developed the idea of setting an ''Adventure of Tintin'' on the moon while producing ''Prisoners of the Sun''.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=135}} He began serialisation of ''[[Destination Moon (comics)|Destination Moon]]'', the first of a two part arc followed by ''[[Explorers on the Moon]]'', in ''Tintin'' magazine in March 1950.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=63}} In September 1950, Hergé broke off the story,{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=2012|1p=227|2a1=Goddin|2y=2011|2p=13}} feeling the need for a break from work, having fallen back into clinical depression. He and Germaine went on holiday to Gland before returning to Brussels in late September.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=227–228}} Many readers sent letters to ''Tintin'' asking why ''Explorers on the Moon'' was no longer being serialised, with a rumour emerging that Hergé had died.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=230}} ''Explorers of the Moon'' would resume after an eighteen month hiatus, returning in April 1952.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=149|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=141|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=232}}
Alongside his work on the new stories, Hergé also made use of the Studios in revising more of his early works.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=159}}

In February 1952, Hergé was involved in a car crash in which Germaine's leg was shattered; she had to have a steel rod implanted in it, and was confined to a wheelchair for several months.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=179|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=239}} Their relationship was further strained when they received news of Wallez's death in September 1952.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=179|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=240}} His friendship with Van Melkebeke also broke apart in this period, in part due to advice gained from an alleged [[clairvoyant]], Bertje Janueneau, whom both Hergé and Germaine were increasingly relying upon for guidance.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=240–242}} In January 1955 a young woman named Fanny Vlamynck was hired as a colourist at the Studios. Hergé embarked on an extra-marital affair with her in November 1956, with the rest of the studio staff soon finding out.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=180|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=260–361}} Germaine grew suspicious of her husband's affections for Fanny, but was also experiencing a strong romantic attraction to her ballroom dance partner.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=261}} Hergé and Germaine went on a cruise for the former's fiftieth birthday in May 1957, in which they visited [[Casablanca]], [[Rabat]], [[Palermo]], and [[Rome]], and in October went on a second holiday, this time to [[Ostend]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=262}} Following this, he revealed his affair with Fanny to Germaine.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=263}}
He began experiencing traumatic dreams dominated by the colour white, and seeking to explain them he visited Franz Ricklin, a [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] who was a student of [[Carl Jung]] in [[Zurich]] in May 1959.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=190–191|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=275–278}} In February 1960 he returned to Switzerland, and upon its arrival back in Brussels he began renting an apartment in [[Uccle]], away from Germaine.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=285}} His relationship with Germaine had ended, although due to restrictions under Belgian law he was unable to obtain a divorce until seventeen years later.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=285}}

In September 1958, ''Tintin'' magazine moved its headquarters to a newly constructed building near the [[Gare du Midi]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=265}} Hergé continued to feud with Leblanc over the direction of the magazine; his constant absences had led to him being replaced as artistic director, and he demanded that he be reinstated. Leblanc relented in early 1965, although Hergé soon departed to [[Sardinia]] for six weeks.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=291–292}} In October 1965 Leblanc appointed the cartoonist [[Greg (cartoonist)|Greg]] to be editor-in-chief of the magazine, believing him capable of reforming the paper to remain relevant to the youth of the day.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=197|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=292}} By this point, ''Tintin'' magazine was at its commercial peak, with sales of 600,000 a week, although Hergé had lost much of his interest in it.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=292}}

Hergé's book sales were higher than ever, and translations were being produced for the British, Spanish, and Scandinavian markets.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=264}} He was receiving international press attention, with articles on his work appearing in ''[[France-Observateur]]'', ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'', and ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]''.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=266}} Paul Vandromme authored an un-critical book on Hergé, ''Le Monde de Tintin'' ("The World of Tintin"), published by [[Gallimard]]; Hergé vetoed the inclusion of a proposed preface by [[Roger Nimier]] after finding its praise for his own work too embarrassing.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=181–183|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=266–267}} Radio adaptations of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' were produced,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=267}} as was an animated cartoon series produced by [[Belvision]], ''[[Hergé's Adventures of Tintin]]''.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=267}} Two live-action films were also produced, ''[[Tintin and the Golden Fleece]]'' (1961) and ''[[Tintin and the Blue Oranges]]'' (1964), the former of which Hergé had been closely involved with.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=227|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=268}}

Developing an interest in [[modern art]], in the early 1960s Hergé befriended the art dealer Marcel Stal, owner of the Carrefour gallery in Brussels.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=216–217|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=303}} He was a particular fan of the work of [[Constant Permeke]], [[Jakob Smits]], [[Lucio Fontana]], and Jean-Pierre Raynaurd, as well as the [[pop art]] movement, in particular the work of [[Roy Lichtenstein]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=304}} He built up his own personal collection, which consisted of both modern paintings as well as [[African art]] and [[Chinese ceramics]].{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=215–216}}
In 1962, Hergé decided he wanted to paint. He chose [[Louis Van Lint]], one of the most respected Belgian [[Abstract art|abstract painters]] at the time, whose work he liked a lot, to be his private teacher.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=218|2a1=Farr|2y=2007|2p=39}}
Hergé took up painting as a hobby,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=295}} producing abstract art works which were influenced by the styles of [[Joan Miró]] and [[Serge Poliakoff]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=302}} He showed his work to the art historian Léo Van Puyvelde, who was the chief conservator of the Musées des Beaux-Arts, who believed that they showed promise but that Hergé's real talent lay with cartoon drawing.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=218|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=302}} Hergé abandoned painting shortly after, having produced 37 paintings in all.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=218|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=302}}
Spending less time on new ''Adventures of Tintin'', from June to December 1965 ''Tintin'' magazine serialised a redrawn and newly coloured version of ''The Black Island'' prepared by staff at Studios Hergé.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=293}} Supported by his studio, Hergé produced ''[[The Calculus Affair]]'' between 1954 until 1956 which was followed by ''[[The Red Sea Sharks]]'' in 1956 to 1957.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=175–8; 260}}

===Final years: 1966–83===
[[File:Tintin magazine 50th anniversary issue.jpg|thumb|right|An issue of ''Tintin'' magazine celebrating the 50th anniversary of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' (1979).]]
In the 1960s, Hergé became increasingly annoyed at the success of [[René Goscinny]] and [[Albert Uderzo]]'s ''[[Asterix]]'' comic book series, which various commentators had described as eclipsing ''The Adventures of Tintin'' as the foremost comic in the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian tradition]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=297–298}} Hoping to imitate the success of the recent animated films ''[[Asterix the Gaul (film)|Asterix the Gaul]]'' (1967) and ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra (film)|Asterix and Cleopatra]]'' (1968), Hergé agreed to the production of two animated Belvision films based on the ''Adventures of Tintin''. The first, ''[[Tintin and the Temple of the Sun]]'' (1969), was based on pre-existing comics, whereas the second, ''[[Tintin and the Lake of Sharks]]'' (1972) was an original story written by [[Greg (cartoonist)|Greg]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=226|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=299}} In 1982 the American filmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]] requested the film rights for a live-action adaptation of one of ''The Adventures of Tintin'', a prospect that excited Hergé, but the project never came to fruition at the time.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=228–229|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=338–339}}

In October 1971, the journalist [[Numa Sadoul]] conducted a wide-ranging interview with Hergé, in which the latter opened up about many of the problems he had experienced in his personal life. Sadoul planned to publish the interview as a book, but Hergé made many alterations to the transcript, both to improve its prose and to remove sections which cast him in a negative light. Editors at Casterman then removed even further sections, particularly those in which Hergé expressed a negative view of Catholicism. The interview was published as ''[[Tintin et moi]]'' ("Tintin and I") in 1975.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=207–208|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=315–317}} Hergé followed this by agreeing to be the subject of a documentary film produced by Henri Roane, ''[[I, Tintin|Moi, Tintin]]'' ("I, Tintin"), which premiered in 1975.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=318}}
In January 1977 he attended an early comic book convention at [[Angoulême]], where he was widely heralded as one of the masters of the discipline.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=238}} To mark the fiftieth anniversary of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' in 1979, a celebratory event was held at Brussels' Hilton hotel, while an exhibit on "Le Musée imaginaire de Tintin" ("The Imaginary Museum of Tintin") was held at the Palais de Beaux-Arts.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=329}}

In April 1971 Hergé visited the United States for the first time, primarily to visit a liver specialist in [[Rochester, Minnesota]], but on the trip he also visited a [[Sioux]] reservation in [[South Dakota]], but was shocked at the conditions in which their inhabitants' lived. On this visit he also spent time in [[Chicago]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Las Vegas]], and [[Kansas City]]. 
{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2011|1p=168|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=301}} In April 1972 he travelled to [[New York City]] for an international conference on the strip cartoon, and there presented Mayor [[John Lindsay]] with a cartoon of Tintin visiting the city and also met with the pop artist [[Andy Warhol]].{{sfn|Goddin|2011|p=174}} Several years later, in 1977, Warhol visited Europe, where he produced a pop art portrait of Hergé.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=218|2a1=Goddin|2y=2011|2p=190}}
In April 1973, Hergé took up an invite to visit [[Taiwan]] by the nation's government, in recognition of his promotion of Chinese culture in ''The Blue Lotus''. During the visit he also spent time in Thailand and Bali.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2011|1p=177|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=318–319}}

Hergé had long sought to regain contact with his old friend [[Zhang Chongren]], with whom he had lost contact. He regularly asked any Chinese people that he met if they knew of Zhang, and in 1979 had some success when a staff member in a Brussels Chinese restaurant revealed that he was Zhang's godson. Hergé was thus able to re-establish contact with his old friend.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2011|1p=184|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=319–320}} The journalist Gérard Valet organised for Zhang to visit Brussels so that he and Hergé could be re-united. The event took place in March 1981, and was heavily publicised; Hergé however found the situation difficult, disliking the press attention and finding that he and Zhang had grown distant during the intervening years.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=225|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=333}}

In June 1970, Hergé's father died, and after the funeral he holidayed near Lake Geneva.{{sfn|Goddin|2011|p=168}}
In 1974, his assistant Branden suffered a stroke and was left unable to write, with Hergé replacing him with a young man, Alain Baran,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=328–329}} who Hergé biographer [[Pierre Assouline]] later termed Hergé's "surrogate son".{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=211}} In March 1977, Hergé's divorce with Germaine was finalised; although Hergé continued to visit her and financially support her, Germaine took the divorce badly, viewing it as a further betrayal.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=328}} Hergé was then able to marry Fanny several weeks later, in a low-key ceremony on 20 May; he was 70 years old and she 42.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2011|1p=190|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=328}}

====Death====
[[File:Tombe d'Hergé Friedhof Uccle Bruxelles.JPG|thumb|150px|Hergé's grave in the cemetery ''Du Dieweg'' in Brussels.]]
In 1979, Hergé was diagnosed with [[osteomyelofibrosis]], necessitating a complete blood transfusion.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=232|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=330}} His need for blood transfusions had increased, as he came to require them every two weeks, and then every week.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=232|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=333, 334}}

On 25 February 1983, Hergé entered [[cardiac arrest]] and was hospitalised in [[intensive care]] at Brussels' [[Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=234|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=334}} He died there on 3 March.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=234|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=334}} His death received [[headline|front page]] coverage in numerous francophone newspapers, including ''[[Libération]]'' and ''[[Le Monde]]''.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=205}} In his will, he had left Fanny as his sole heir.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=233}}

In November 1986, Fanny closed Studios Hergé, replacing it with the [[Hergé Foundation]].{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=210|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=338}}

In 1988, ''Tintin'' magazine itself was discontinued.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=338}}

==Personal life==
Hergé was a highly private person,{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=156}} being described by biographer [[Harry Thompson]] as "reserved [and] unostentatious".{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=155}} According to his biographer Pierre Sterckx, Hergé appeared "very conventional" in public but in reality was "extremely erudite, with an insatiable curiosity, constantly on the watch".{{sfn|Sterckx|2015|p=7}} He greatly enjoyed walking in the countryside,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=92}} gardening,{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=156}} and art collecting,{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=156}} and he was a fan of [[jazz music]].{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=156|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=206–207}} Although he disliked making public or press appearances,{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=155}} Hergé insisted on personally responding to all [[fan mail]] received, which took up a considerable part of his time.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=151}} He stated that "not replying to children's letters would be to betray their dreams."{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=313}} Friends described him as a humorous man, known particularly for his [[self-deprecation|self-deprecating]] jokes.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=156}} Colleagues described Hergé as [[egocentric]], an assessment he agreed with.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=156}} He was known to be authoritarian in dealing with his assistants and refused to share credit with them for their part in his work.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=147, 208|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2p=154}} Sterckx noted that "on the one hand he could be distant, even frosty, but on the other he was affectionate".{{sfn|Sterckx|2015|p=7}}

Throughout his first marriage he had a number of affairs with other women.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=134}} He had no children, having been rendered sterile by radiation treatment,{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=211|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=206}} but in the 1950s offered to adopt his brother Paul's two children, Denise and George, when their parents were experiencing trouble in their relationship. Paul declined the offer, with Denise and George later noting that they had no great affection for Hergé, deeming him awkward around children.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=211|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=258–259}} Hergé was raised as a [[Catholic]] although was never a devout practitioner of the religion.{{sfn|Sterckx|2015|p=12}} His adherence to Catholicism declined in later life as he developed a keen interest in [[Taoism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=185, 212–213|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=332}} and became an [[agnosticism|agnostic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=208|2a1=Sterckx|2y=2015|2p=12}} He was a fan of the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' and [[Arnaud Desjardins]]' ''[[The Path to Wisdom]]'',{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=213}} as well as [[Fritjof Capra]]'s ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' and the work of [[Jean-Émile Charon]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=332}}

===Political views===
Politically, Hergé was a fervent [[royalism|royalist]], and remained so throughout his life,{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=147}} also believing in the [[Belgian nationalism|unity of Belgium]].{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=210}}
In his early life, Hergé was "close to the traditional right-wing" of Belgian society,{{sfn|Apostolidès|2010|p=9}} with Sterckx noting that through his work he was "plunged into rightist, even extreme right-wing circles".{{sfn|Sterckx|2015|p=54}} According to Harry Thompson, such political ideas were not unusual in middle-class circles in Belgium of the 1920s and early 1930s, where "patriotism, Catholicism, strict morality, discipline and naivety were so inextricably bound together in everyone's lives that right-wing politics were an almost inevitable by-product. It was a world view shared by everyone, distinguished principally by its complete ignorance of the world."{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=24}} When Hergé took responsibility for {{lang|fr|[[Le Petit Vingtième]]}}, he followed Wallez's instruction and allowed the newspaper to contain explicitly pro-fascist and [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] sentiment.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=38}} Literary critic [[Jean-Marie Apostolidès]] noted that the character of Tintin was a personification of the "New Youth" concept which was promoted by the European far right.{{sfn|Apostolidès|2010|p=10}} Under Wallez's guidance, the early ''Adventures of Tintin'' contained explicit political messages for its young readership. ''Tintin in the Land of the Soviets'' was a work of [[anti-socialism|anti-socialist]] propaganda,{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=12}} while ''Tintin in the Congo'' was designed to encourage colonialist sentiment toward the [[Belgian Congo]],{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=26|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=24|3a=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=45}} and ''Tintin in America'' was designed as a work of [[anti-Americanism]] heavily critical of capitalism, commercialism, and industrialisation.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=35|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=56}}

In contrast to Hergé's involvement in Belgium's right-wing, Sterckx thought the cartoonist to have been "a liberal and independent spirit",{{sfn|Sterckx|2015|p=54}} someone who was "the very opposite of a conservative [or] a reactionary of the right".{{sfn|Sterckx|2015|p=7}} [[Michael Farr]] asserted that Hergé had "an acute political conscience" during his earlier days, as exemplified by his condemnation of racism in the United States evident in ''Tintin in America''.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=29}} Literary critic [[Tom McCarthy (novelist)|Tom McCarthy]] went further, remarking that ''Tintin in America'' represented the emergence of a "left-wing counter tendency" in Hergé's work that rebelled against his right-wing milieu and which was particularly critical of wealthy capitalists and industrialists.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=38}} This was furthered in ''The Blue Lotus'', in which Hergé rejected his "classically right-wing" ideas to embrace an [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] stance,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=76–77, 82}} and in a contemporary ''Quick &amp; Flupke'' strip in which he lampooned the far right leaders of Germany and Italy, [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]].{{sfn|Goddin|2008|p=148}} Although many of his friends and colleagues did so in the mid-1930s, Hergé did not join the far-right Rexist Party, later asserting that he "had always had an aversion to it" and commenting that "to throw my heart and soul into an ideology is the opposite of who I am."{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=89}}

===Accusations of racism===
[[File:Angry King in Tintin.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A comics strip panel.  A heavily-caricatured African king jumps in the air angrily, saying, "Curses! ... Our military done for! ... By my ancestors, me myself kill miserable white man!" |The King of the M'Hatuvu in the 1946 version of ''Tintin in the Congo''; such depictions have widely been labelled racist.]]
Hergé has faced repeated accusations of racism due to his portrayal of various ethnic groups throughout ''The Adventures of Tintin''. According to McCarthy, in ''Tintin in the Congo'' Hergé represented the Congolese as "good at heart but backwards and lazy, in need of European mastery".{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=37}} Thompson argued that Hergé had not written the book to be "deliberately racist" and that it reflected the average early 20th-century Belgian view of the Congolese, which was more patronising than malevolent.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=40}} The book provoked no controversy at the time,{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=28}} only coming to be perceived as racist in the latter 20th century.{{sfn|Time|2010}}

In the following adventure, ''Tintin in America'', Hergé depicted members of the [[Blackfoot]] tribe of Native Americans as "gullible, even naive", though it was nevertheless "broadly sympathetic" to their culture and plight, depicting their oppression at the hands of the United States army.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=29}} In ''The Blue Lotus'', he depicted the Japanese as militaristic and buck-toothed, which has also drawn accusations of racism.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=62–63}}

Hergé has also been accused of utilising [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] stereotypes. The character of Rastapopoulos has been claimed{{By whom|date=October 2018}} to be based on anti-semitic stereotypes, despite Hergé's protestations that the character was Greek, and not Jewish.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=42|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=64–65}}

From his early years, Hergé was openly critical of racism. He lambasted the pervasive racism of United States society in a prelude comment to ''Tintin in America'' published in ''Le Petit Vingtième'' on 20 August 1931,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=56}} and ridiculed racist attitudes toward the Chinese in ''The Blue Lotus''.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=62|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=35|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=77}} Peeters asserted that "Hergé was no more racist than the next man",{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=46}} an assessment shared by Farr, who after meeting Hergé in the 1980s commented that "you couldn't have met someone who was more open and less racist".{{sfn|BBC News|2010}} In contrast, President of the International ''Bande Dessinée'' Society Laurence Grove opined that Hergé adhered to prevailing societal trends in his work, and that "When it was fashionable to be a Nazi, he was a Nazi. When it was fashionable to be a colonial racist, that's what he was."{{sfn|BBC News|2010}}

==Legacy==

Assouline described Hergé as "the personification of Belgium".{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=210}}

===Hergé Museum===
[[Image:2001-2009 Hergé museum, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgique, 01.jpg|thumb|The Hergé Museum, concept and construction between 2001–09]]

The [[Musée Hergé]] is located in the centre of [[Louvain-la-Neuve]], a city to the south of Brussels.{{sfn|The Economist|2009}} This location was originally chosen for the Museum in 2001. The futuristic building was designed by [[Pritzker Prize]]-winning French architect [[Christian de Portzamparc]] and cost €15 million to build.{{sfn|The Economist|2009}} On the centenary of the birth of Hergé, 22 May 2007, the museum's first stone was laid. The museum opened its doors in June 2009.{{sfn|The Economist|2009}}

The idea of a museum dedicated to the work of Hergé can be traced back to the end of the 1970s, when Hergé was still alive. After his death in 1983, Hergé's widow, Fanny, led the efforts, undertaken at first by the [[Hergé Foundation]] and then by the new Studios Hergé, to catalogue and choose the artwork and elements that would become part of the Museum's exhibitions.{{sfn|The Economist|2009}}

The Hergé Museum contains eight permanent galleries displaying original artwork by Hergé, and telling the story of his life and career which had not previously been visible to the public.{{sfn|The Economist|2009}}{{sfn|Time|2009}} The Museum also houses a temporary exhibition gallery. Although Tintin features prominently in the museum, Hergé's other comic strip characters, such as Jo, Zette and Jocko, and Quick and Flupke, as well as his work as a graphic designer, are also present.{{sfn|Time|2009}}

{{BLP sources|date=November 2010}}  
'''Kenneth Goodman''' (born December 23, 1927) is Professor Emeritus, Language Reading and Culture, at the University of Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kgoodman/ken.html|title=Kenneth S. Goodman|publisher=University of Arizona|accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for developing the theory underlying the literacy philosophy of [[whole language]].

== Biography ==
After publishing an influential book on the subject, Goodman began to create a psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic model of reading inspired by the work of [[Noam Chomsky]]. Goodman decided that the process of reading was similar to the process of learning a language as conceptualized by Chomsky, and that literacy developed naturally as a consequence of experiences with print, just as language ability developed naturally as a consequence of experiences with language. Goodman concluded that attempts to teach rules ("[[phonics]]") to children for decoding words were inappropriate and not likely to succeed.

After developing and researching the Whole Language model, Goodman presented his work to the [[American Educational Research Association]] (AERA) conference and published an article in the ''Journal of the Reading Specialist,'' in which he famously wrote that reading is a "[[psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic]] guessing game." He retired from the [[University of Arizona]] in August 1998.

== Theory ==
Goodman's concept of written language development views it as parallel to oral language development. Goodman's theory was a basis for the [[whole language]] movement, which was further developed by [[Yetta Goodman]], [[Regie Routman]], [[Frank Smith (psycholinguist)|Frank Smith]] and others. His concept of reading as an analogue to language development has been studied by brain researchers such as Sally Shaywitz, who rejected the theory on the grounds that reading does not develop naturally in the absence of instruction. Despite this, the theory continues to receive support from some scholars. Goodman's theory and strong convictions made him an icon of the whole language movement and a lightning rod for criticism from those who disgree with it. His book ''What's Whole in Whole Language'' sold over 250,000 copies in six languages.

== Achievements ==
Goodman is a controversial figure in the education community. He has served in several important capacities, including as President of the [[International Reading Association]], President of the National Conference on Research in Language and Literacy, and President of the Center for Expansion of Language and Thinking. He also worked extensively with the [[National Council of Teachers of English]]. He received a number of awards, including the James Squire award from NCTE for contributions to the profession and NCTE (2007). Goodman has published over 150 articles and book chapters as well as a number of books. In addition to ''What's Whole in Whole Language'', he also wrote ''Ken Goodman on Reading'' and ''Phonics Phacts''; all were published by Heinemann.  His latest book is ''Scientific Realism in Studies of Education'', which was published by Taylor and Francis in 2007.

== Phonology ==
There are three lexically contrastive [[contour tone]]s in Konyak – rising (marked in writing by an acute accent – á), falling (marked by a grave accent – à) and level (unmarked).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nagaraja|2010|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in Egypt of French-speaking Lebanese parents. There was at least one sibling, a brother, [[Georges Schehadé]].{{sfn|Badr|2010|p=26}} The family was of [[Greece|Greek]] [[Greek Orthodox Church|orthodox]] aristocratic French-speaking ancestry. Schehadé studied in Beirut. In 1934, she married an Italian diplomat, the Marquis Giorgio Benzoni, whom she met in [[Damascus]], and then lived abroad in [[Sarajevo]], Poland, Czechoslovakia, [[Paris]], and Holland.

Schehadé published short-run booklets, which were largely autobiographical fictions, returning to her past and expressing in fluid poetic language her nostalgia for Lebanon and the days of her childhood. Several of these short texts were collected in 1999 under the title ''Les Livres d'Anne''; included is a historical depiction of violence in Lebanon.{{sfn|Jack|1996|p=210}}

[[File:Moderniranianlanguagesmap.jpg|thumb|right|305px|The Iranian languages [[Language border|are also situated]] in around the Assyrian Homeland, where they'd [[Language contact|influence the language]].&lt;ref&gt;Yohannan, A. (1900). A Modern Syriac-English dictionary, Part 1, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Loanwords in [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]]''' came about mostly due to the contact between [[Assyrian people]] and [[Arabs]], [[Iranian people|Iranians]], [[Kurds]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]] in [[modern history]], and can also be found in the other two major dialects spoken by the Assyrian people, these being [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Turoyo]].&lt;ref&gt;Yildiz, Efrem, ''The Aramaic Language and Its Classification'', Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies 14:1 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Assyrian is one of the few languages where most of its foreign words come from a different [[language family]] (in this case, [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]).&lt;ref&gt;Odisho, Edward Y. (2002). „The role of aspiration in the translation of loanwords in Aramaic and Arabic“, W. Arnold and H. Bobzin (ed.): Sprich doch mit deinen Knechten aramäisch, wir verstehen es! 60 Beiträge zur Semitistik. Festschrift für Otto Jastrow zum 60 Geburtstag, Wiesbaden, 489-502.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other [[Neo-Aramaic]] languages, Assyrian has an extensive number of latterly introduced [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] [[loanwords]]&lt;ref&gt;Younansardaroud, Helen, ''Synharmonism in the Särdä:rïd Dialect'', Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies 12:1 (1998): 77-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the dialect, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] loanwords are also reasonably present.&lt;ref&gt;The Neo-Aramaic Dialect of Barwar, Geoffrey Khan, Boston, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Turkish language|Turkish]] loanwords are [[Turkification|Turkified]] words that are of Arabic origin.&lt;ref&gt;Yamauchi, Edwin M., ''Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic or Syriac? A Critique of the Claims of G.M. Lamsa for the Syriac Peshitta'', Bibliotheca Sacra 131 (1974): 320-331.&lt;/ref&gt; To note, some of the loanwords are revised (or "Assyrianized"), and therefore would sound somewhat [[Phono-semantic matching|different to the original word]].&lt;ref&gt;Yohannan, Abraham, ''Some Remarks Regarding the Pronunciation of Modern Syriac'', Journal of the American Oriental Society 25 (1904)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some loanwords may also have a slightly [[False friend|different meaning]] from the original language.&lt;ref&gt;Younansardaroud, Helen (1999). „The influence of Modern Persian on the Särdä:rïd dialect“, Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, XIII:65-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Europe Mediterranean Catalan Atlas.jpeg|thumb|200 px|Map of Europe and the Mediterranean from the [[Catalan Atlas]] of 1375]]
The '''Mediterranean Lingua Franca''' or '''''Sabir''''' was a [[pidgin]] language used as a [[lingua franca]] in the [[Mediterranean Basin]] from the 11th to the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italica.rai.it/principali/lingua/bruni/lezioni/f_lll5.htm ''Lingua franca del Mediterraneo'' or ''sabir'' (in Italian), article of Francesco Bruni] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328135757/http://www.italica.rai.it/principali/lingua/bruni/lezioni/f_lll5.htm |date=2009-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Lingua franca'' means literally "language of [[the Franks]]" in [[Late Latin]], and originally referred specifically to the language that was used around the [[Levant|Eastern Mediterranean Sea]] as the main [[trade language|language of commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/;jsessionid=CE16CF21639CD47224E9DAB3DD00FEFF?authRejection=true&amp;url=%2Fview%2FEntry%2F108685%3FredirectedFrom%3Dlingua%2520franca|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the terms "Franks" and "Frankish" were actually applied to [[Franks#Legacy|all Western Europeans]] during the late [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Period]].&lt;ref name=HEL&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.komvos.edu.gr/dictonlineplsql/simple_search.display_full_lemma?the_lemma_id=16800&amp;target_dict=1|title=''Lexico Triantaphyllide'' online dictionary , Greek Language Center (''Kentro Hellenikes Glossas''), lemma Franc ( Φράγκος ''Phrankos'') , ''Lexico tes Neas Hellenikes Glossas'', G.Babiniotes, Kentro Lexikologias(Legicology Center) LTD Publications|isbn=960-86190-1-7|quote=Franc and (prefix) franco- (Φράγκος ''Phrankos'' and φράγκο- ''phranko-''|publisher=Komvos.edu.gr|accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00weekuoft/ |title=An etymological dictionary of modern English : Weekley, Ernest, 1865-1954 : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the meaning of ''lingua franca'' expanded to mean any [[Lingua franca|bridge language]]. Its other name in the Mediterranean area was ''Sabir'', deriving from a [[Romance Languages|Romance]] base meaning "to know".

Based mostly on [[Northern Italian languages]] (mainly Venetian and Genoese dialects) and [[Occitano-Romance languages]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]]) in the western Mediterranean area at first,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uab.cat/Document/439/403/castellanos_linguafranca2007.pdf La «lingua franca», una revolució lingüística mediterrània amb empremta catalana, Carles Castellanos i Llorenç]&lt;/ref&gt; it later came to have more [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] elements, especially on the [[Barbary coast]] (today referred to as the [[Maghreb]]). Sabir also borrowed from [[Berber language|Berber]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[French language|French]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. This mixed language was used widely for commerce and diplomacy and was also current among slaves of the [[bagnio]], [[Barbary pirates]] and European [[:wikt:renegades|renegades]] in pre-colonial [[Algiers]]. Historically the first to use it were the [[Italian Levantine|Genoese and Venetian trading colonies]] in the eastern Mediterranean after the year 1000.

{{Quote|"As the use of Lingua Franca spread in the Mediterranean, dialectal fragmentation emerged, the main difference being more use of Italian and Provençal vocabulary in the Middle East, while Ibero-Romance lexical material dominated in the Maghreb. After France became the dominant power in the latter area in the 19th century, Algerian Lingua Franca was heavily gallicised (to the extent that locals are reported having believed that they spoke French when conversing in Lingua Franca with the Frenchmen, who in turn thought they were speaking Arabic), and this version of the language was spoken into the nineteen hundreds ....  Algerian French was indeed a dialect of French, although Lingua Franca certainly had had an influence on it. Lingua Franca also seems to have affected other languages. [[Eritrean Pidgin Italian]], for instance, displayed some remarkable similarities with it, in particular the use of Italian participles as past or perfective markers. It seems reasonable to assume that these similarities have been transmitted through Italian [[foreigner talk]] stereotypes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/corre/www/franca/edition3/foreword.html| title=Foreword to A Glossary of Lingua Franca| last=Parkvall| first=Mikael| author-link=Mikael Parkvall| editor=Alan D. Corré| editor-link=Alan D. Corré| date=2005| edition=5th| location=Milwaukee, WI, United States| access-date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Hugo Schuchardt]] (1842–1927) was the first scholar to investigate the Lingua Franca systematically. According to the [[monogenetic theory of the origin of pidgins]] he developed, Lingua Franca was known by Mediterranean sailors including the Portuguese. When [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese started exploring]] the seas of Africa, America, Asia and Oceania, they tried to communicate with the natives by mixing a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-influenced version of Lingua Franca with the local languages. When English or French ships came to compete with the Portuguese, the crews tried to learn this "broken Portuguese". Through a process of [[relexification]], the Lingua Franca and Portuguese [[lexicon]] was substituted by the languages of the peoples in contact.

This theory is one way of explaining the similarities between most of the European-based pidgins and [[creole language]]s, such as [[Tok Pisin]], [[Papiamento]], [[Sranan Tongo]], [[Krio language|Krio]], and [[Chinese Pidgin English]]. These languages use forms similar to ''sabir'' for "to know" and ''piquenho'' for "children".

Lingua Franca left traces in present [[Algerian slang]] and [[Polari]]. There are traces even in geographical names, such as [[Cape Guardafui]] (that literally means cape "look and escape" in Lingua Franca and ancient Italian).

==Example of "Sabir"==

An example of Sabir is found in [[Molière]]'s [[comedy]] ''[[Le Bourgeois gentilhomme]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.site-moliere.com/pieces/bourg405.htm IV.sc.5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614050823/http://www.site-moliere.com/pieces/bourg405.htm |date=2013-06-14 }}; there is a translation [https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/corre/www/franca/edition2/moliere.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the "Turkish ceremony", the [[Mufti]] enters singing the following words:

&lt;poem&gt;Se ti sabir
Ti respondir
Se non sabir
Tazir, tazir

Mi star Mufti:
Ti qui star ti?
Non intendir:
Tazir, tazir.
&lt;/poem&gt;

A comparison of the Sabir version with the same text in each of similar languages, first a word-for-word substitution according to the rules of Sabir grammar and then a translation inflected according to the rules of the similar language's grammar, can be seen below:

The [[Lombard language|Lombard]], Italian, Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Portuguese, Provençal, French, and Latin versions are not correct grammatically, as they use the [[infinitive]] rather than inflected verb forms, but the Sabir form is obviously derived from the infinitive in those languages. The correct version for each language is given in italics.

'''Miriam Akavia''' also '''Matylda Weinfeld''' (1927 – 16 January 2015) was a Polish-born Israeli [[writer]] and [[translator]], a [[Holocaust]] survivor, and the president of the [[Platform for Jewish-Polish Dialogue]].&lt;ref name="dziennik"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dziennikpolski24.pl/artykul/3719942,miriam-akavia-19272015,id,t.html |title=Miriam Akavia (1927-2015) |publisher=DziennikPolski24.pl |date=19 January 2015 |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dialog"&gt;{{cite news |trans-title=Platforma Dialogu Polsko-Żydowskiego |title=Platform for Jewish-Polish Dialogue |work=Homepage |publisher=Dialog.org |url=http://www.Dialog.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
She was born in 1927 in [[Krakow]] to the Weinfeld family. During World War II she was interned in the [[Kraków Ghetto]], and then an inmate of the [[Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp]], [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] and finally the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]]. After the latter camp's liberation by the [[British army]], she was among the ailing women inmates evacuated by the Swedish [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] for convalescence in Sweden. In 1946 she found her way to [[Mandatory Palestine|pre-State Israel]]. She qualified as a registered nurse, and studied literature and history at [[Tel Aviv University]]. She also served as a [[cultural attaché]] in Israeli diplomatic posts located in [[Budapest]] and [[Stockholm]].

Miriam Akavia has been publishing her novels and books since 1975. As a president of the [[Platform for Jewish-Polish Dialogue]], she has been organizing meetings with teenagers of both countries. Moreover, she struggled against stereotypes which separate [[Poles]] and [[Jews]].

== Writing ==

Miriam Akavia wrote mainly about her childhood, the Holocaust and her war experiences. She was also a translator who translates Hebrew literature into Polish language and vice versa.

She is a laureate of many honours in [[Poland]], [[Israel]] and [[Germany]]. In 1978 she received a [[Yad Vashem Prize]]. Her books have been translated into many languages including [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Danish language|Danish]], and [[French language|French]].

The '''Mulam language''' {{zh|c=仫佬|p='''Mùlǎo'''}} is a [[Kam–Sui language]] spoken mainly in [[Luocheng County]], [[Hechi]], northern [[Guangxi]] by the [[Mulao people]]. The greatest concentrations are in Dongmen and Siba communes. Their [[Endonym|autonym]] is ''mu6 lam1''. The Mulam also call themselves ''kjam1'', which is probably cognate with ''lam1'' and the Dong people's autonym "Kam" (Wang &amp; Zheng 1980).

The Mulam language, like [[Dong language|Dong]], does not have voiced stop, but does have a phonemic distinction between unvoiced and voiced nasals and laterals. It has a system of eleven distinct vowels. It is a tonal language with ten tones, and 65% of its vocabulary is shared with the Zhuang and Dong languages.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Since the [[Ming dynasty]], Chinese characters have been utilized to read and write the Mulam language.  The majority of the Mulam also speak Chinese as well as the Zhuang and Dong languages.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The language of Mulam leads to a comparison between two languages as [[Graham Thurgood]] states, “For ‘headlouse,’ the KS forms are highly irregular: Kam, Mulam…” (Oceanic Linguistics, Vol. 33, No 2). This relates to the way in which one language can be interpreted through another language, which displays a level of diversity as they may derive different meanings from the translations. Within [https://archive.org/details/rosettaproject_mlm_phon-1/ Mulam Phonology], there is a display of the syllables for Mulam that seems very difficult to decipher without having much knowledge of how they communicate with the dialect. The Mulam ethnic group traces back to the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271-1368), differing from the current society they have now as the people of Mulam eventually split in the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644-1912).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The majority of the Mulam population are bilingual in the Mulam and the Zhuang language.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Dialects==
The following Mulam dialects are described by Wang &amp; Zheng (1980) (all of which are spoken in [[Luocheng Mulao Autonomous County]]).

* Dongmen 东门镇 (in Dayin 大银, Dafu 大福村, Le'e 勒俄村 etc.)
* Long'an 龙岸镇 (in Liangsi 良泗, etc.)
* Huangjin 黄金镇 (in Zhongjian 中间寨, etc.)
* Qiaotou 桥头镇 (in Dongnong 洞弄屯, etc.)
* Siba 四把镇 (in Dawu 大梧, Miao'er 苗儿屯, Shuangzhai 双寨村, etc.)
* Xiali 下里乡 (in Xiecun 谢村, etc.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6483">'''Mx''', usually pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɪ|k|s||}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ʌ|k|s||}} or {{IPAc-en||m|ə|k|s||}} ({{respell|muks}} or {{respell|miks}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mx|title=Definition of Mx|publisher=Oxford English Dictionaries|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cassolotl.tumblr.com/post/103744029100|title=On the pronunciation of Mx|date=27 Nov 2014|publisher=Spacious Perspicacious|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[English language]] [[neologism|neologistic]] [[honorific]] that does not indicate gender. It was developed as an alternative to common gendered honorifics, such as [[Mr.]] and [[Ms.]], in the early 1980s. It is often used by [[genderqueer|nonbinary]] people, as well as those who do not wish to reveal or be referred to by their gender. It is a [[gender neutral title|gender-neutral title]] that is now widely accepted by the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] and many businesses in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is included in all major English [[Dictionary|dictionaries]].

==Etymology==
The word was first proposed in the late 1970s, with widespread usage since 1985.&lt;ref name="SundayTimesDict"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article1551885.ece|title=Now pick Mr, Mrs, Miss, Ms . . . or Mx for no specific gender|date=3 May 2015|publisher=The Sunday Times|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/11597192/Whats-it-like-to-be-a-Mx.html |title= What’s it like to be a Mx? |author= Olivia Goldhill |work= The Telegraph |date= 11 May 2015 |accessdate= 1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "x" is intended to stand as a [[wildcard character]], and does not imply a "mixed" gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://practicalandrogyny.com/2014/08/28/when-was-the-mx-gender-inclusive-title-created/ |title= When was the Mx gender-inclusive title created? |author= Nat Titman |work= Practical Androgyny |date= 28 August 2014 |accessdate= 4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
In 2013 [[Brighton and Hove City Council]] in [[Sussex]], England, voted to allow the use of Mx on council forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-22465531|title=Mx (Mixter) title adopted in Brighton for transgender people|date=10 May 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014 the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] included the title as an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= 
https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2014/nov/17/rbs-bank-that-likes-to-say-mx |title= RBS: the bank that likes to say Mx |work= The Guardian |date= 17 November 2014 |first= Emine |last= Saner |accessdate= 26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, recognition spread more broadly across UK institutions, including the [[Royal Mail]], government agencies responsible for documents such as [[British passport|passport]]s and [[Driving licence in the United Kingdom|driving licences]], most [[List of banks in the United Kingdom|major banks]], several other companies, and UK charity [[Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3066043/A-new-title-transgender-people-join-Mr-Mrs-Miss-used-driving-licences-bank-details-government-departments.html |title=Mr, Mrs, Miss... and Mx: Transgender people will be able to use new title on official documents |date=4 May 2015 |publisher=Daily Mail |accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title is now accepted by the [[Department for Work and Pensions]], [[HM Revenue and Customs]], the [[National Health Service]] and many councils, universities, insurance companies and utility retailers in the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] confirmed in 2015 that it would accept the use of Mx by MPs.&lt;ref name="PinkNewsMPs"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCormick|first1=Joseph Patrick|title=MPs given gender neutral option when entering House of Commons|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/05/26/mps-given-gender-neutral-option-when-entering-house-of-commons/|accessdate=4 April 2016|work=Pink News|date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[HSBC]] banks announced the addition of Mx alongside several other gender-neutral titles as options for their customers. The March 30 announcement coincided with the [[International Transgender Day of Visibility]], celebrated the following day.&lt;ref name="guardian-30mar2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brignall|first1=Miles|title=HSBC offers choice of transgender titles for bank's customers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/30/hsbc-offers-choice-of-transgender-titles-for-banks-customers|accessdate=10 April 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Mx was included in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.vox.com/2015/12/31/10695218/2015-year-in-words |title= 10 words that explain 2015 |date= 31 December 2015 |accessdate= 1 January 2016 |work= Vox |author=Tanya Pai}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 2016 it was added to Merriam-Webster Unabridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/mx-gender-neutral-title |title= A Gender-Neutral Honorific |accessdate= 23 August 2016 |work=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Metro Bank (United Kingdom)|Metro Bank]] became the first bank to offer Mx on its forms (though other banks had amended records to Mx on request prior to this),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Charles|title=A British bank has become the first in the world to offer a third gender option for 'non-binary' customers|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/metro-bank-is-the-first-to-offer-a-third-gender-option-for-customers-2016-11|website=Business Insider UK|accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[HSBC]] adopted the title in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HSBC adds new transgender titles including M and Misc|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39444432|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mx is increasing in usage, but remains uncommon in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Gender-Neutral Honorific: Mx: Words We're Watching|publisher= Merriam-Webster,|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/mx-gender-neutral-title |date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nyanga-li''' (''Linyanga-le'') is a [[Bantu language]] in [[Orientale Province]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].  '''Gbati-ri''' (Gbote) is a dialect.  Maho (2009) lists them separately as unclassified [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages#Zone D|Zone D.30]] languages, but ''Ethnologue'' states that they are "members of the same dialect subgroup",&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt; and ''[[Glottolog]]'' places them nearest the [[Ngendan languages]].

'''Herbert Paul Grice''' (13 March 1913 – 28 August 1988),&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/grice/|title=Paul Grice|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=[[Richard Grandy]] and [[Richard Warner (author)|Richard Warner]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually publishing under the name '''H. P. Grice''', '''H. Paul Grice''', or '''Paul Grice''', was a British [[philosopher of language]], whose work on [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] has influenced the philosophical study of [[semantics]]. He is known for his theory of [[implicature]].

==Life==
Born and raised in Harborne (now a suburb of Birmingham), in the United Kingdom, he was educated at [[Clifton College]]&lt;ref&gt;"Clifton College Register" Muirhead, J.A.O. p431: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; and then at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;publish.uwo.ca/~rstainto/papers/Grice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
After a brief period teaching at [[Rossall School]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; he went back to Oxford where he taught at [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] until 1967. In that year, he moved to the United States to take up a professorship at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he taught until his death in 1988. He returned to the UK in 1979 to give the [[John Locke lectures]] on ''Aspects of Reason''. He reprinted many of his essays and papers in his valedictory book, ''Studies in the Way of Words'' (1989).&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

He was married and had two children.

==Grice on meaning==
One of Grice's two most influential contributions to the study of language and communication is his theory of [[linguistic meaning|meaning]], which he began to develop in his article 'Meaning', written in 1948 but published only in 1957 at the prodding of his colleague, [[P. F. Strawson|P.F. Strawson]].&lt;ref&gt;See discussion of this history in Russell Dale, ''[http://www.russelldale.com/dissertation/1996.RussellDale.TheTheoryOfMeaning.pdf The Theory of Meaning]'', Chapter 1, endnote 31, p. 34.  See Chapter 2, "The Theory of Meaning in the Twentieth Century" for background on Grice's ideas in the 1957 paper "Meaning".&lt;/ref&gt; Grice further developed his theory of meaning in the fifth and sixth of his William James lectures on "Logic and Conversation", delivered at Harvard in 1967. These two lectures were initially published as 'Utterer's Meaning and Intentions' in 1969 and 'Utterer's Meaning, Sentence Meaning, and Word Meaning' in 1968, and were later collected with the other lectures as the first section of Studies in the Way of Words in 1989.

===Natural vs. non-natural meaning===

In the 1948 article 'Meaning', Grice describes "natural meaning" using the example of "Those spots mean (meant) measles."

And describes "non-natural meaning" using the example of "John means that he'll be late" or "'Schnee' means 'snow'".

Grice does not define these two senses of the verb 'to mean', and does not offer an explicit theory that separates the ideas they're used to express. Instead, he relies on five differences in [[ordinary language]] usage to show that we use the word in (at least) two different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Grice 1989, pp. 213–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intention-based semantics===

For the rest of 'Meaning', and in his discussions of meaning in 'Logic and Conversation', Grice deals exclusively with non-natural meaning. His overall approach to the study of non-natural meaning later came to be called "intention-based semantics", because it attempts to explain non-natural meaning based on the idea of a speakers' intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Schiffer 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borg 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell Dale, ''[http://www.russelldale.com/dissertation/1996.RussellDale.TheTheoryOfMeaning.pdf The Theory of Meaning]'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, Grice made two kinds of non-natural meaning:

'''Utterer's meaning''': What a speaker means by an utterance. (Grice wouldn't introduce this label until "Logic and Conversation." The more common label in contemporary work is "speaker meaning", though Grice didn't use that term.)

'''Timeless meaning''': The kind of meaning that can be possessed by a type of utterance, such as a word or a sentence. (This is often called "conventional meaning", although Grice didn't call it that.)

The two steps in intention-based semantics are (1) to define utterer's meaning in terms of speakers' overt audience-directed intentions, and then (2) to define timeless meaning in terms of utterer's meaning. The net effect is to define all linguistic notions of meaning in purely mental terms, and to thus shed psychological light on the semantic realm.

Grice tries to accomplish the first step by means of the following definition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A meant&lt;sub&gt;NN&lt;/sub&gt; something by x" is roughly equivalent to "A uttered x with the intention of inducing a belief by means of the recognition of this intention".&lt;ref&gt;Grice 1989, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(In this definition, 'A' is a variable ranging over speakers and 'x' is a variable ranging over utterances.) Grice generalises this definition of speaker meaning later in 'Meaning' so that it applies to commands and questions, which, he argues, differ from assertions in that the speaker intends to induce an intention rather than a belief.&lt;ref name="Grice 1989, p. 220"&gt;Grice 1989, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Grice's initial definition was controversial, and seemingly gives rise to a variety of counterexamples,&lt;ref&gt;Schiffer 1972, pp.17–29.&lt;/ref&gt; and so later adherents of intention-based semantics—including Grice himself,&lt;ref&gt;Grice 1968, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Schiffer]],&lt;ref&gt;Schiffer 1972, ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Bennett (philosopher)|Jonathan Bennett]],&lt;ref&gt;Bennett 1976, ch.5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Deirdre Wilson]],&lt;ref&gt;Sperber and Wilson 1986, pp.21–31.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Neale]]&lt;ref&gt;Neale 1992, pp.544–550.&lt;/ref&gt;—have attempted to improve on it in various ways while keeping the basic idea intact.

Grice next turns to the second step in his program: explaining the notion of timeless meaning in terms of the notion of utterer's meaning. He does so very tentatively with the following definition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;x means&lt;sub&gt;NN&lt;/sub&gt; (timeless) that so-and-so" might as a first shot be equated with some statement or disjunction of statements about what "people" (vague) intend (with qualifications about "recognition") to effect by x.&lt;ref name="Grice 1989, p. 220"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The basic idea here is that the meaning of a word or sentence results from a regularity in what speakers use the word or sentence to mean. Grice would give a much more detailed theory of timeless meaning in his sixth Logic and Conversation lecture.&lt;ref&gt;Grice 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; A more influential attempt to expand on this component of intention-based semantics has been given by Stephen Schiffer.&lt;ref&gt;Schiffer 1972, chs. 4 and 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grice's theory of implicature==

Grice's most influential contribution to philosophy and linguistics is his theory of implicature, which started in his 1961 article, 'The Causal Theory of Perception', and was most fully developed in his 1967 "Logic and Conversation", at Harvard's 'William James Lectures'.&lt;ref&gt;Grice 1989, chs.1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saying/implicating distinction===
According to Grice, what a speaker means by an utterance can be divided into what the speaker "says" and what the speaker thereby "implicates".&lt;ref&gt;Neale 1992, pp.523–524.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grice makes it clear that the notion of saying he has in mind, though related to a colloquial sense of the word, is somewhat technical,  referring to it as "a favored notion of 'saying' that must be further elucidated".&lt;ref name="Grice 1989, p.86"&gt;Grice 1989, p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Grice never settled on a full elucidation or definition of his favoured notion of saying, and the interpretation of this notion has become a contentious issue in the philosophy of language.

One point of controversy surrounding Grice's favoured notion of saying is the connection between it and his concept of utterer's meaning. Grice makes it clear that he takes saying to be a kind of meaning, in the sense that doing the former entails doing the latter: "I want to say that (1) "U (utterer) said that p" entails (2) "U did something x by which U meant that p" (87).&lt;ref&gt;Grice 1989, p.87.&lt;/ref&gt; This condition is controversial, but Grice argues that apparent counterexamples—cases in which a speaker apparently says something without meaning it—are actually examples of what he calls "making as if to say", which can be thought of as a kind of "mock saying" or "play saying".&lt;ref&gt;Neale 1992, p.554.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point of controversy surrounding Grice's notion of saying is the relationship between what a speaker says with an expression and the expression's timeless meaning. Although he attempts to spell out the connection in detail several times,&lt;ref&gt;Grice 1989, pp.87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; the most precise statement that he endorses is the following one:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the sense in which I am using the word say, I intend what someone has said to be closely related to the conventional meaning of the words (the sentence) he has uttered.&lt;ref&gt;Grice 1989, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unfortunately, Grice never spelled out what he meant by the phrase "closely related" in this passage, and philosophers of language continue to debate over its best interpretation.

In 'The Causal Theory of Perception', Grice contrasts saying (which he there also calls "stating") with "implying", but in Logic and Conversation he introduces the technical term "implicature" and its cognates "to implicate" and "implicatum" (i.e., that which is implicated).&lt;ref&gt;Grice 1989, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; Grice justifies this neologism by saying that "'Implicature' is a blanket word to avoid having to make choices between words like 'imply', 'suggest', 'indicate', and 'mean'".&lt;ref name="Grice 1989, p.86"/&gt;

Grice sums up these notions by suggesting that to implicate is to perform a "non-central" speech act, whereas to say is to perform a "central" speech act.&lt;ref name="Grice 1989, p.88"&gt;Grice 1989, p.88.&lt;/ref&gt; As others have more commonly put the same distinction, saying is a kind of "direct" speech act whereas implicating is an "indirect" speech act. This latter way of drawing the distinction is an important part of [[John Searle]]'s influential theory of speech acts.&lt;ref&gt;Searle 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conventional vs. conversational implicature===
Although Grice is best known for his theory of conversational implicature, he also introduced the notion of conventional implicature. The difference between the two lies in the fact that what a speaker conventionally implicates by uttering a sentence is tied in some way to the timeless meaning of part of the sentence, whereas what a speaker conversationally implicates is not directly connected with timeless meaning. Grice's best-known example of conventional implicature involves the word 'but', which, he argues, differs in meaning from the word 'and' only in that we typically conventionally implicate something over and above what we say with the former but not with the latter. In uttering the sentence 'She was poor but she was honest', for example, we say merely that she was poor and she was honest, but we implicate that poverty contrasts with honesty (or that her poverty contrasts with her honesty).&lt;ref&gt;Neale 1992, p.521–522.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grice makes it clear that what a speaker conventionally implicates by uttering a sentence is part of what the speaker means in uttering it, and that it is also closely connected to what the sentence means. Nonetheless, what a speaker conventionally implicates is not a part of what the speaker says.

&lt;blockquote&gt;U's doing ''x'' might be his uttering the sentence "She was poor but she was honest". What ''U'' meant, and what the sentence means, will both contain something contributed by the word "but", and I do not want this contribution to appear in an account of what (in my favored sense) ''U'' said (but rather as a conventional implicature).&lt;ref name="Grice 1989, p.88"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Grice did not elaborate much on the notion of conventional implicature, but many other authors have tried to give more extensive theories of it, including [[Lauri Karttunen]] and Stanley Peters,&lt;ref&gt;Karttunen and Peters 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Kent Bach,&lt;ref&gt;Bach 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Neale,&lt;ref&gt;Neale 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and Christopher Potts.&lt;ref&gt;Potts 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversational implicature===
To conversationally implicate something in speaking, according to Grice, is to mean something that goes beyond what one says in such a way that it must be inferred from non-linguistic features of a conversational situation together with general principles of communication and co-operation.

The general principles Grice proposed are what he called [[Gricean maxims|the Cooperative principle and the Maxims of Conversation]]. According to Grice, the cooperative principle is a norm governing all cooperative interactions among humans.

'''Cooperative Principle''': "Make your contribution such as it is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged." (Grice 1989: 26).

The conversational maxims can be thought of as precisifications of the cooperative principle that deal specifically with communication.

'''Maxim of Quantity:''' Information
* Make your contribution as informative as is required for the current purposes of the exchange.
* Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.

'''Maxim of Quality:''' Truth
* Do not say what you believe to be false.
* Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.

'''Maxim of Relation:''' Relevance
* Be relevant.

'''Maxim of Manner:''' Clarity ("be perspicuous")
* Avoid obscurity of expression.
* Avoid ambiguity.
* Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity).
* Be orderly.&lt;ref&gt;Grice 1989, pp.26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grice follows his summary of the maxims by suggesting that "one might need others", and goes on to say that "There are, of course, all sorts of other maxims (aesthetic, social, or moral in character), such as "Be polite", that are also normally observed by participants in exchanges, and these may also generate nonconventional implicatures."&lt;ref&gt;Grice 1989, pp.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversational implicatures are made possible, according to Grice, by the fact that the participants in a conversation always assume each other to behave according to the maxims. So, when a speaker appears to have violated a maxim by saying or making as if to say something that is false, uninformative or too informative, irrelevant, or unclear, the assumption that the speaker is in fact obeying the maxims causes the interpreter to infer a hypothesis about what the speaker really meant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#refKordicKI1991|Kordić 1991]], pp.91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; That an interpreter will reliably do this allows speakers to intentionally "flout" the maxims—i.e., create the appearance of breaking the maxims in a way that is obvious to both speaker and interpreter—to get their implicatures across.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Perhaps Grice's best-known example of conversational implicature is the case of the reference letter, a "quantity implicature" (i.e., because it involves flouting the first maxim of Quantity):

&lt;blockquote&gt;A is writing a testimonial about a pupil who is a candidate for a philosophy job, and his letter reads as follows: "Dear Sir, Mr. X's command of English is excellent, and his attendance at tutorials has been regular. Yours, etc." (Gloss: A cannot be opting out, since if he wished to be uncooperative, why write at all? He cannot be unable, through ignorance, to say more, since the man is his pupil; moreover, he knows that more information than this is wanted. He must, therefore, be wishing to impart information that he is reluctant to write down. This supposition is tenable only if he thinks Mr. X is no good at philosophy. This, then, is what he is implicating.)&lt;ref&gt;Grice 1989, pp.33.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given that a speaker means a given proposition ''p'' by a given utterance, Grice suggests several features which ''p'' must possess to count as a conversational implicature.

'''Nondetachability:''' "The implicature is nondetachable insofar as it is not possible to find another way of saying the same thing (or approximately the same thing) which simply lacks the implicature."&lt;ref&gt;Grice 1989, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cancelability:''' "...a putative conversational implicature is explicitly cancelable if, to the form of words the utterance of which putatively implicates that ''p'', it is admissible to add ''but not p'', or ''I do not mean to imply that p'', and it is contextually cancelable if one can find situations in which the utterance of the form of words would simply not carry the implicature."&lt;ref name="Grice 1989, p.44"&gt;Grice 1989, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-Conventionality:''' "...conversational implicata are not part of the meaning of the expressions to the employment of which they attach."&lt;ref name="Grice 1989, p.44"/&gt;

'''Calculability:''' "The presence of a conversational implicature must be capable of being worked out; for even if it can in fact be intuitively grasped, unless the intuition is replaceable by an argument, the implicature (if present at all) will not count as a conversational implicature; it will be a conventional implicature."&lt;ref&gt;Grice 1989, pp.31. (See also Grice 1981, p.187 and Neale 1992, p527.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalized vs. particularised conversational implicature===
Grice also distinguishes between generalised and particularised conversational implicature. Grice says that particularised conversational implicatures (such as in the reference letter case quoted above) arise in "cases in which an implicature is carried by saying that ''p'' on a particular occasion in virtue of special features about the context, cases in which there is no room for the idea that an implicature of this sort is normally carried by saying that ''p''."&lt;ref name="Grice 1989, p.37"&gt;Grice 1989, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; Generalized implicature, by contrast, arise in cases in which "one can say that the use of a certain form of words in an utterance would normally (in the absence of special circumstances) carry such-and-such an implicature or type of implicature."&lt;ref name="Grice 1989, p.37"/&gt; Grice does not offer a full theory of generalised conversational implicatures that distinguishes them from particularlised conversational implicatures, on one hand, and from conventional implicatures, on the other hand, but later philosophers and linguists have attempted to expand on the idea of generalised conversational implicatures.&lt;ref&gt;For a prominent example, see Levinson 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grice's paradox==
In his book ''Studies in the Way of Words'' (1977?), he presents what he calls "Grice's Paradox".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Grice, ''Studies in the Way of Words'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1991), pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he supposes that two chess players, Yog and Zog, play 100 games under the following conditions:

(1) Yog is white nine of ten times.&lt;br&gt;
(2) There are no draws.

And the results are:

(1) Yog, when white, won 80 of 90 games.&lt;br&gt;
(2) Yog, when black, won zero of ten games.

This implies that:

(i) 8/9 times, if Yog was white, Yog won.&lt;br&gt;
(ii) 1/2 of the time, if Yog lost, Yog was black. &lt;br /&gt;
(iii) 9/10 that either Yog wasn't white or he won.

From these statements, it might ''appear'' one could make these deductions by [[contraposition]] and [[disjunction (logic)|conditional disjunction]]:

([a] from [ii]) If Yog was white, then 1/2 of the time Yog won.&lt;br&gt;
([b] from [iii]) 9/10 times, if Yog was white, then he won.

But both (a) and (b) are untrue—they contradict (i).  In fact, (ii) and (iii) don't provide enough information to use [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] reasoning to reach those conclusions.  That might be clearer if (i)-(iii) had instead been stated like so:

(i) When Yog was white, Yog won 8/9 times.  (No information is given about when Yog was black.)&lt;br /&gt;
(ii) When Yog lost, Yog was black 1/2 the time.  (No information is given about when Yog won.)&lt;br /&gt;
(iii) 9/10 times, either Yog was black and won, Yog was black and lost, or Yog was white and won.  (No information is provided on how the 9/10 is divided among those three situations.)

Grice's paradox shows that the exact meaning of statements involving conditionals and probabilities is more complicated than may be obvious on casual examination.

==Criticisms and examinations==

[[Relevance theory]] of [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Deirdre Wilson]] builds on and also challenges Grice's theory of meaning and his account of pragmatic inference. See ''Relevance: Communication and Cognition'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1986).

Grice's work is examined in detail by [[Stephen Neale]], "Paul Grice and the Philosophy of Language", ''Linguistics and Philosophy'' 15: 5 (Oct. 1992).

'''Pazeh''' (also spelled '''Pazih''', '''Pazéh''') is an almost  extinct language of the [[Pazeh people|Pazeh]], a [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese aboriginal people]]. It was a [[Formosan language]] of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family. The last remaining native speaker of Pazeh proper, [[Pan Jin-yu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blust|1999|p=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; died in 2010 at the age of 96.&lt;ref name=extinct/&gt; Before her death, she offered Pazeh classes to about 200 regular students in Puli and a small number of students in Miaoli and Taichung.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/06/26/2003415773&lt;/ref&gt; Kulun (sometimes also spelled Kulon) was a dialect that became extinct earlier. The insulting name "fan" was used against Plains Aborigines by the [[Han Taiwanese]], and the [[Hokkien|Hoklo Taiwanese]] speech was forced upon Aborigines like the Pazeh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/06/15/2003592824&lt;/ref&gt; Hoklo Taiwanese has replaced Pazeh and driven it to near extinction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/06/26/2003415773&lt;/ref&gt; Aboriginal status has been requested by Plains Aboriginals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/07/15/2003595134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Pazeh has 17 consonants, 4 vowels, and 4 [[diphthong]]s (-ay, -aw, -uy, -iw).&lt;ref name="blust1999"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Notes on Pazeh Phonology and Morphology| last=Blust| first = Robert| journal= Oceanic Linguistics|authorlink=Robert Blust|year= 1999|volume = 38 |pages= 321–365|doi =10.1353/ol.1999.0002 | issue=2|ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#{{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} do not actually share the same [[place of articulation]]; {{IPA|/d/}} is [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] or prealveolar and {{IPA|/t/}} (as well as {{IPA|/n/}}) is [[interdental consonant|interdental]]. Other coronal consonants tend to be prealveolar or post-dental.
#The distribution for the [[glottal stop]] is allophonic, appearing only between like vowels, before initial vowels, and after final vowels. It is also largely absent in normal speech
#{{IPA|/ɡ/}} is [[spirantization|spirantized]] intervocalically
#{{IPA|/z/}} is actually an alveolar/prealveolar [[affricate consonant|affricate]] {{IPA|[dz]}} and only occurs as a syllable onset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blust|1999|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#{{IPA|/h/}} varies between glottal and [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] realizations ({{IPA|[ħ]}}) and is sometimes difficult to distinguish from {{IPA|/x/}}

Although Pazeh contrasts voiced and voiceless obstruents, this contrast is neutralized in final position for labial and velar stops, where only {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} occur respectively ({{IPA|/d/}} is also devoiced but a contrast is maintained). {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} are also neutralized to the latter.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Blust|1999|p=324"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blust|1999|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voiceless stops are unreleased in final position.

Mid vowels ({{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[o]}}) are allophones of close vowels ({{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} respectively).  
* Both lower when adjacent to {{IPA|/h/}}.
* {{IPA|/u/}} lowers before {{IPA|/ŋ/}}. {{IPA|[u]}} and {{IPA|[o]}} are in free variation before {{IPA|/ɾ/}}
*[[reduplication|Reduplicated]] morphemes carry the phonetic vowel even when the reduplicated vowel is not in the phonological context for lowering.
**{{IPA|/mutapitapih/}} → {{IPA|[mu.ta.'''pɛ'''.taˈpɛh]}} ('keep clapping').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blust|1999|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA|/a/}} is somewhat advanced and raised when adjacent to {{IPA|/i/}}. Prevocally, high vowels are semivocalized. Most coronal consonants block this, although it still occurs after {{IPA|/s/}}. Semivowels also appear post-vocally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blust|1999|p=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonotactics==
The most common morpheme structure is CVCVC where C is any consonant and V is any vowel. Consonant clusters are rare and consist only of a nasal plus a homorganic obstruent or the glide element of a diphthong.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Blust|1999|p=324"/&gt;

Intervocalic voiceless stops are voiced before a morpheme boundary (but not following one) .&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blust|1999|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress falls on the ultimate syllable.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Blust|1999|p=324" /&gt;

==Sound changes==
The Pazih language merged the following [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] phonemes (Li 2001:7).

#&lt;nowiki&gt;*C, *S &gt; s&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#&lt;nowiki&gt;*D, *Z &gt; d&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#&lt;nowiki&gt;*k, *g &gt; k&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#&lt;nowiki&gt;*j, *s &gt; z&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#&lt;nowiki&gt;*S&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, *H &gt; h
#&lt;nowiki&gt;*N, *ñ &gt; l&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#&lt;nowiki&gt;*r, *R &gt; x&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Pazih also split some Proto-Austronesian phonemes:
#&lt;nowiki&gt;*S &gt; s (merged with *C)&lt;/nowiki&gt;; *S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, *H &gt; h
#&lt;nowiki&gt;*w &gt; ø, w&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#&lt;nowiki&gt;*e &gt; e, u&lt;/nowiki&gt;

==Grammar==
Like [[Bunun language|Bunun]], [[Seediq language|Seediq]], Squliq [[Atayal language|Atayal]], Mantauran [[Rukai language|Rukai]], and the [[Tsouic languages]],&lt;ref&gt;Li, Paul Jen-kuei. 1997. "A Syntactic Typology of Formosan Languages – Case Markers on Nouns and Pronouns." In Li, Paul Jen-kuei. 2004. Selected Papers on Formosan Languages. Taipei, Taiwan: Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica.&lt;/ref&gt; Pazeh does not distinguish between common nouns and personal names, whereas Saisiyat does (Li 2000). Although closely related to Saisiyat, the Pazeh language does not have the infix -um- that is present in Saisiyat.

===Morphology===
Pazeh makes ready use of [[affix]]es, [[infix]]es, [[suffix]]es, and [[circumfix]]es, as well as reduplication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blust|1999|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pazeh also has "focus-marking" in its verbal morphology. In addition, verbs can be either stative or dynamic.

There are four types of focus in Pazeh (Li 2000).
#Agent-focus (AF): mu-, me-, mi-, m-, ma-, ∅-
#Patient-focus (PF) -en, -un
#Locative-focus (LF): -an
#Referential-focus (RF): sa-, saa-, si-

The following affixes are used in Pazeh verbs (Li 2000).
*-in- 'perfective'
*-a- 'progressive'
*-ay 'actor focus, irrealis', -aw 'patient focus, irrealis'
*-i 'non-agent-focused imperative'

The following are also used to mark aspect (Li 2000).
*Reduplication of the verb stem's first syllable – 'progressive'
*lia – "already"

===Affixes===
The Pazih affixes below are from Li (2001:10–19).

{{refend}}

===Syntax===
Although originally a verb-initial language, Pazeh often uses SVO (verb-medial) sentence constructions due to influence from Chinese.

There are four case markers in Pazeh (Li 2000).

#''ki'' Nominative
#''ni'' Genitive
#''di'' Locative
#''u'' Oblique

Pazeh has the following negators (Li 2001:46).

*ini – no, not
*uzay – not
*kuang ~ kuah – not exist
*mayaw – not yet
*nah – not want
*ana – don't

===Pronouns===
The Pazeh personal pronouns below are from Li (2000). (''Note'': vis. = visible, prox. = proximal)

==Numerals==
Pazeh and Saisiyat are the only [[Formosan languages]] that do not have a bipartite numerical system consisting of both human and non-human numerals (Li 2006).&lt;ref name="Li2006"&gt;Li, Paul Jen-kuei. 2006. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4499950 Numerals in Formosan Languages]. Oceanic Linguistics, Vol. 45, No. 1 (Jun., 2006), pp. 133–152.&lt;/ref&gt; Pazeh is also the only language that forms the numerals 6 to 9 by addition (However, Saisiyat, which is closely related to Pazeh, expresses the number 6 as 5 + 1, and 9 as 10 &amp;minus; 1.)

*1 = ida adang
*2 = dusa
*3 = turu
*4 = supat
*5 = xasep
*6 = 5 + 1 = xaseb-uza
*7 = 5 + 2 = xaseb-i-dusa
*8 = 5 + 3 = xaseb-i-turu
*9 = 5 + 4 = xaseb-i-supat

The number "five" in Pazeh, ''xasep'', is similar to Saisiyat ''Laseb'', Taokas ''hasap'', Babuza ''nahup'', and Hoanya ''hasip'' (Li 2006). Li (2006) believes that the similarity is more likely because of borrowing rather than common origin. [[Laurent Sagart]] considers these numerals to be ancient retentions from Proto-Austronesian, but [[Paul Jen-kuei Li]] considers them to be local innovations. Unlike Pazeh, these Plains Aboriginal languages as well as the [[Atayalic languages]] use 2 &amp;times; 4 to express the number 8. (The [[Atayalic languages]] as well as [[Thao language|Thao]] also use 2 &amp;times; 3 to express the number 6.) Saisiyat, Thao, Taokas, and Babuza use 10 &amp;minus; 1 to express 9, whereas Saisiyat uses 5 + 1 to express 6 as Pazeh does.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sinica.edu.tw/as/advisory/journal/15-1/59-62.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ilongot language]] of the Philippines also derives numerals in the same manner as Pazeh does (Blust 2009:273).&lt;ref name="Blust2009"&gt;Blust, Robert. 2009. ''The Austronesian Languages''. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University. {{ISBN|0-85883-602-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-85883-602-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, numerals can function as both nouns and verbs in all [[Formosan languages]], including Pazeh.

'''Pramod Maruti Mande''' (19 December 1954 – 17 October 2017), popularly known as '''Bhau''', was an Indian historian and writer. He was been rewarded as Durgamaharshi and Sahyadri Putra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpcnews.in/latest-news/item/9781-pune?jus1=2 Pramod Mande]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loksatta.com/tag/pramod-mande/ Pramod Mande]&lt;/ref&gt; He specialised in writing about the history of Indian forts and freedom fighters.

==Works==
Mande travelled widely for 40 years and surveyed more than 2,000 forts, believing that forts must be seen and observed to understand the work of [[Shivaji]]. He built up a collection of over 15,000 books on history, 3,000 slides and 200,000 photos of various forts, and more than 450 pictures and oil paintings of Indian freedom fighters.

He used to conduct two programs includes History of Shivaji Maharaj and Aazadi ke diwane. He travelled 2 times on the exact route of [[Rajgad]] to [[Agra]] and Agra to Rajgad, a route passed through seven states and over 1,000 kilometers on which Shivaji had gone to Agra to meet Aurangzeb. He has delivered more than five thousands of lectures on Shivaji to create interest about Shivaji in younger generations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://maharashtratimes.indiatimes.com/maharashtra/pune-news/pramod-mande-is-no-more-pune-pramod-mande-pmc/articleshow/61123488.cms गडकिल्यांचे अभ्यासकप्रमोद मांडे यांचे निधन]&lt;/ref&gt; His 200 exhibitions on history talks about his works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2504">'''Rauma language''' (''"rauman giäl"'') is a [[dialect of Finnish]] spoken in the town of [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]], western [[Finland]].

The written form of the dialect was preserved by the writer and doctor [[Hj. Nortamo]], and is currently practiced mainly as a hobby. Some of the most distinctive characteristics of the dialect (as written) are the use of letters 'g' and 'b', which are not common in Finnish language. Pronunciation of these letters is, however, closer to the more common 'k' and 'p' of mainstream Finnish.

Rauma dialect is practically extinct from real-life use. Many people in Rauma do speak in a way that carries a resemblance to this dialect - as an example, the tempo of speech is faster than average Finnish, with a lot of shortened words, but few can speak the actual Rauma dialect.

There are several subcategories of Rauma dialect, which have subtle differences and have their roots in neighbouring communities.

== Examples with Finnish and English translations ==

* '''"San snää mnuu snuuks, snuuks mnääki snuu sno."'''
** Finnish: Sano sinä minua sinuksi, sinuksi minäkin sinua sanon.
** Spoken Finnish of Helsinki area: Sano säki mua suks, suks mäki sua sanon.
** English: You should call me "thou", as I will call you "thou" too. (Used when dropping titles and starting to use first names.)
* '''"Ol niingon gotonas"'''
** Finnish: Ole kuin kotonasi.
** Spoken Finnish of Helsinki area: Oo niinku kotonas.
** English: Feel yourself at home.
* '''"Luanikast reissu"'''
** Finnish: Hyvää matkaa.

A '''revoicer''' provides communication assistance by carefully listening to the speech patterns uttered by an individual with a [[speech disability]], using [[lipreading]] (speechreading) and attention to other cues if necessary for full understanding of the utterances, and then repeats the same words in a manner that is more clear and understandable to the listener. Revoicers generally have excellent skills in auditory phonetic/phonemic [[pattern recognition]], similar to those utilized by a [[court reporter]] or [[stenographer]], to identify the sounds of speech ([[phoneme|phonemic]] sounds) of the speaker.

==Professional revoicers==
Professional (compensated) revoicers are requested and utilized by individuals with speech disabilities, and are paid in the same manner as other auxiliary service providers for persons with communication-related disabilities. In the [[United States]], professional revoicers are compensated pursuant to the federal [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]], Section 3,  and the [[ADA Amendments Act of 2008|Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments of 2008]].

==Types of professional revoicers==
(1) Professional revoicers are used by individuals with speech disabilities who have normal or near-normal hearing ability; and

(2) Professional DHH revoicers are used by individuals whose speech disabilities were caused by early severe or profound bilateral (both ears) hearing loss who wish to speak in their own words and with their own voices. The professional DHH revoicer is usually highly experienced and is able to function in a dual capacity—acting as a professional revoicer for expressive communications (utilizing lipreading (speechreading) and gestural cues, if necessary), and also acting as a communication assistant for receptive communications (using any method preferred and chosen by the person with the speech disability).

==Professional revoicers for telephone communications==
Professional Revoicers are also used by telephone companies, under the [[STS Relay]] System first established by [[Robert Segalman]], [[Ph.D.]], who established the nonprofit organization, "Speech Communication Assistance by Telephone, Inc." (SCT).  The STS Relay System uses professional revoicers as "Speech-to-Speech Communication Assistants"(STS C.A.s). The STS C.A. Revoices the words of the person with a speech disability so that the other person on the call can understand him or her. The STS Relay System is now available at no cost to persons with speech disabilities in many countries. In the United States, the STS Relay System is monitored by the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/dro/sts.html STS Access Numbers in the US]&lt;/ref&gt; and can be accessed by dialing 711 on any voice telephone and requesting "STS Relay Service".

==Other assistive technologies==
In some situations, technologies such as ''computerized speech generating devices'' (also known as "[[voice synthesizer]]s," where a "computerized voice" is heard by the listener(s)) are used by some individuals with speech disabilities. However, these systems may not work in some situations, and in other situations, the individual with the speech disability may not be able to effectively utilize these types of devices, due to additional disability difficulties, or in situations where interpersonal spoken communication is rapidly paced.

==Criticism of revoicing in the criminal justice system==
The use of revoicing in criminal trials has been compared to the now widely discredited use of other types of facilitated communication,&lt;ref name="FC"&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1279809 | pmid=7601804 | doi=10.1901/jaba.1995.28-189 | volume=28 | title=An experimental analysis of facilitated communication | journal=J Appl Behav Anal | pages=189–200 | last1 = Montee | first1 = BB | last2 = Miltenberger | first2 = RG | last3 = Wittrock | first3 = D | last4 = Watkins | first4 = N | last5 = Rheinberger | first5 = A | last6 = Stackhaus | first6 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is believed to have resulted in innocent people being accused of crimes.&lt;ref name="FC2"&gt;[http://www.science20.com/countering_tackling_woo/holding_educators_accountable_evidencebased_practices_facilitated_communication_isnt_one-80315/]&lt;/ref&gt; One concern is focused on the tendency of the revoicer to have some bias in favor of the alleged victims, as many people claiming to be revoicers available for court testimony also have association with victim advocacy groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5635">'''Silvio Blatter''' (born 25 January 1946 in [[Bremgarten, Switzerland|Bremgarten]], canton [[Aargau]]) is a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] writer.

==Life==
Silvio Blatter was born into a working-class family. He attended school at the "[[Bezirksschule]]"-level in his hometown. From 1962 to 1966, he attended the teacher's seminar in [[Wettingen]], canton Aargau. He worked as a primary school teacher for six years in [[Aarau]], the capital of canton Aargau. In 1970, he worked in a metalworking company.

In 1972, Blatter began his college education at the [[University of Zurich]] in  literature and language studies, matriculating after six semesters. In 1974, he was employed as a machinist in the plastics industry. The following year, he completed training for directors of audio plays at the Swiss Broadcast (Schweizer Radio DRS, part of [[SRG SSR idée suisse]]).

After long stays in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Husum]], Blatter finally settled in [[Zürich]] as a freelance writer. Currently, he resides in [[Oberglatt|Oberglatt (canton Zurich)]].

==Work==
Silvio Blatter mostly writes [[prose]]. In his early works, he described every-day life and the monotony of industrial work in a very haunting and detailed manner. The author became known due to his ''Freiamt-Trilogie'' ("Freiamt trilogy") comprising the following novels that were published in Blatter's home region that is called "[[Freiamt]]" (a certain part of Aargau):
* ''Zunehmendes Heimweh'' (literally: "Increasing homesickness")
* ''Kein schöner Land'' (literally: "No country more beautiful". Note: The German title stems from an old fixed phrase that uses ''Land'' with a male article, although the neuter article would be the correct use today.)
* ''Das sanfte Gesetz'' (literally: "The soft law").

These thick books paint a wide picture of the Freiamt region and its inhabitants. They are realistic family novels. In "Das sanfte Gesetz" for example, Blatter portrays four generations of the fictional family Wolf, a family of entrepreneurs. They suffer tragedy. After a car crash, one family member needs leg amputation, another family member is shot by the police and the son loves his young stepmother, who gets pregnant and the reader doesn’t know by whom. In another volume of the trilogy, a little boy observes hand grenades stolen from a small Swiss army depot at a drill ground/shooting range.

Blatter's narrative style is very realistic and modern. He mentions the boy playing [[Nintendo]] [[Game &amp; Watch]] hand-held games and names of pop songs and singers ([[Herbert Grönemeyer]], [[Level 42]] and others). Even [[He-Man]] from [[Masters of the Universe]] plays a role. The child discusses religion with a nun and compares He-Man with [[Jesus]], coming to the conclusion that Jesus, who was a "transformer," wouldn’t have a chance against his enemies, when he – after the Christian belief - becomes man in Judgment Day. Man's body was weak because it was of flesh, so Jesus shall stay a roadside granite sculpture.

Despite the realistic style, some of Blatter's books contain a slight trace of everyday magic that Blatter seemingly doesn’t want destroy. In "Das sanfte Gesetz," there is a totemist thinking of Nina, the mysterious nun and the great-grandfather talking to his donkeys, sending light beams into space. Blatter himself sometimes seems to describe life in esoteric terms.

During the 1990s, Blatter stopped writing, as he had taken up painting. Since 2000, writing and painting again have the same importance for him.

==Memberships==
Silvio Blatter is a member of the Swiss-German [[International PEN|PEN]] Centre (from 1984 to 1986 he was its chairman) and of the club "[[Autorinnen und Autoren der Schweiz]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9189">'''Site analysis''' is a preliminary phase of architectural and urban design processes dedicated to the study of the climatic, geographical, historical, legal, and infrastructural context of a specific site.&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Olgyay]], Design with Climate, bioclimatic approach to architectural regionalism, ''Princeton University Press'', 1963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="white"&gt;Edward T. White, Site Analysis: Diagramming Information for Architectural Design, ''Architectural Media Ltd'', 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="brown"&gt;[https://architecture.uoregon.edu/faculty/brown G.Z. Brown], Sun, Wind, and Light, architectural design strategies, ''John Wiley &amp; Sons'', 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of this analytic process is a summary, usually a graphical sketch, which sets in relation the relevant environmental information with the morphology of the site in terms of parcel, topography, and built environment. This result is then used as a starting point for the development of environment-related strategies during the design process.

A number of graphical tools for site analysis have been developed to assist designers in this task. Examples of traditional climate-related site analysis tools are the Sundial,&lt;ref name ="brown" /&gt; the Sun Path Diagram,&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.naturalfrequency.com/wiki/Sun-Path_Diagram&lt;/ref&gt; the Radiation Square,&lt;ref name ="DeKayBrown"&gt;M. DeKay &amp; G.Z. Brown, Sun Wind &amp; Light, architectural design strategies, 3rd ed. ''Wiley'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Wind rose|Wind Rose]], and the Wind Square.&lt;ref name ="DeKayBrown" /&gt; These conventional methods of site analysis are efficient in simple sites with irrelevant close obstructions, where the analysis can be reduced to the parcel at the ground level or even exclusively to its center point. More elaborated techniques, like Volumetric Site Analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Michele Leidi, [http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:47313/eth-47313-02.pdf Volumetric site analysis for the conceptualization of architecture in the urban context], ''ETH-Zürich'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Teller &amp; S. Azar, [http://www.townscope.com/ Townscope II ‐ A computer system to support solar access decision making], ''Solar Energy'', p. 187–200, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Marsh, [http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2006-leicester/Presentations/AndrewMarsh.pdf The Interaction of Radiance and Ecotect], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; can instead be used to study more intricate and obstructed sites like those of high and dense urban settings.

==Process ==
As described by Edward T. White &lt;ref name ="white" /&gt; the site design process is divided up into three sections; [[research]] phase, [[wiktionary:Analysis|analysis]] phase, and [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]] phase.  These three phases are divided into the eight chronological steps in the design process.

* Research phase: The first step is defining the problem and its definition.  This is part of the research phase.  The site design and site planning process begins with the initial problem to be solved.  This is started by a client [[contracting]] a planner to work with a particular site.
* Analysis phase: The next step involves programming the site as well as site and [[user analysis]], which is focused on in-depth below.  There are numerous site elements related to the analysis during this phase.  This is part of the analysis phase in site planning.
* Synthesis phase: From the analysis, a program is developed, which is part of the synthesis phase. The third step deals with schematic [[design]] of a [[site plan]] as well as a preliminary cost estimate for the site. Step four involves more developed designs and a detailed cost estimate. Step five is the construction documents or the plan. Bidding and contracting for the project follows as step six. Construction then will take place as step seven. The final step, step eight, in the site design process is occupation and management of the site.

== Elements  ==
Numerous elements go into a given site analysis.  These elements include [[Location (geography)|location]], [[neighborhood]] context, [[Construction|site]] and [[zoning]], legal elements, [[nature|natural]] physical features, man-made features, [[circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]], [[utilities]], [[Sensory perception|sensory]], human and cultural, and [[climate]] components.  The following elements typically are considered in most sites:

* Location : The site should be related to major streets or landmarks previously existing.  [[Aerial photographs]] help in this assessment stage.  There should be documentation of distances and time from major places.  This should be completed by either driving or walking the distance first-hand.
* Neighborhood context : Zoning of the neighborhood is important and information of this type can typically be found at the [[municipal planning department]] of the site. Numerous issues at this stage require direct observation.  Features of this sort include architectural patterns, street lighting, and condition of existing buildings.  This would also include the immediate surroundings of the site.The reaction of the surrounding buildings towards the site and people moving around should be analysed. Other important components of the neighbourhood context include an analysis of existing paths (pedestrian, cyclist, and vehicle), landmarks and nodes. Landmarks are distinctive sites that provide way-finding for people in the area, and which define the character of a neighbourhood. Nodes are key public gathering places that encourage people to linger and socialize.
* Site and zoning : Site boundaries can be located by either verifying the dimensions physically or contacting the county tax assessor’s office.  Zoning classifications, set-backs, height restrictions, allowable site coverage, uses, and parking requirements are obtained by obtaining zoning classifications from a zoning map, which can be located from the city planning department.
* Infrastructure, social, and political boundaries.
* Legal : Typical legal information can be obtained from the [[deed]] to the property. The deed is held by the owner of the title insurance company. In the deed is information such as the property description, present ownership, and the governmental jurisdiction the site is located in, and the city or county.
* Natural physical features : Most of this information will be derived from the topographic features on the site.  A contour map of this magnitude can be located from the survey [[engineer]].  Drainage problems as well as existing natural features of trees, ground cover, ground texture, and soil conditions on the site should be directly observed.
* Man made features : Features located on the site such as buildings, walls, fences, patios, plazas, bus stop shelters should be noted. The site and location of such features should be directly measured.  Documentation of existing historical districts should be made, some of which may already have reports completed. Locating this information can be done through the municipal planning department for the site.
* Circulation : The uses of streets, roads, alleys, sidewalks, and plazas are important in this inventory step.  It is not necessarily an analysis of these elements but more an analysis of what occurs on these circulation gateways.
* Utilities : Information for utilities concerning the site can be found through the utility departments and companies in the local area. Generally, the company has a print of the drawing of this information needed. Information in this print includes the location of all utilities and their locations around or on the site itself.
* Sensory : Much of the sensory information collected will be done through first hand experience. The information is obtained from sketching and photographs (sometimes aerial photographs). Direct observation of other sensory elements of noise, odors, smoke, and pollutant areas must also be completed.
* Human and cultural : This information can be obtained through census statistics on the neighborhood.  Information regarding these statistics is available from the local municipal planning agency.  This information includes activities among people on the site and their relationships to these activities.
* Climate : This information can be obtained through the local weather service.  Conditions such as [[rainfall]], [[snowfall]], [[humidity]], and [[temperature]] over months must be considered and analyzed.  The sun-path and vertical sun angles throughout an entire year are important to note.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5047">'''SmartAction''' is a US company based in El Segundo, Ca. that provides artificial intelligence-based services to businesses across diverse industries including financial services, healthcare, insurance, retail, travel and hospitality and utilities. Originally founded in 2002 as a research project, SmartAction’s Intelligent Voice Automation (IVA) is a hosted IVR platform that uses natural language speech recognition and is based on an object-oriented coding framework. SmartAction was founded by inventor and entrepreneur Peter Voss. https://www.smartaction.ai/about-us/

==History==

In the early 1990s, founder Peter Voss &lt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/vosspeter/&gt; developed a new theory of intelligence, outlined in the book Artificial General Intelligence. In 2001, Voss founded an R&amp;D startup, Adaptive AI, Inc., to research and develop a prototype artificial general intelligence system based on his theory of intelligence [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence]. In 2009 Voss founded Smart Action Company, LLC to commercialize this technology. Born out of Voss' research and development, SmartAction created its first practical application of this new technology focused on the management of inbound and outbound calls for contact centers. SmartAction has continued to develop the technology into a highly specialized purpose-driven. AI, identified by the company as Intelligent Voice Automation. In 2017, SmartAction developed its first chat applications as part of a new product initiative known as Omni-bot. In February 2018, the company was recapitalized, having been purchased by growth capital firms Staley Capital (Boston, MA) and TVC Capital (San Diego, CA).

==Technology==

SmartAction uses two layers of technology in its systems. The first is speech recognition, which enables the system to understand natural language spoken 
words and phrases. Second is a proprietary artificial intelligence engine used to determine the meaning and intent behind the spoken words, drive the conversation with the caller, and improve over time. The AI engine's built-in knowledge and skills also makes development and updates to the system much faster and easier than with older technology. This integration of solutions enables SmartAction to solve real business problems including;  streamlining customer experiences through voice and text, eliminate customer wait times using self-service options and creating the first Omni-bot solution which significantly increased success rates.  Omni-bot is a conversational AI platform that combines voice and digital functionality to provide intelligent automation in every channel.

==What is AI?==

Artificial intelligence (AI, also machine intelligence, MI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence (NI) displayed by humans and other animals.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence]. In computer science AI research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem-solving".(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)&gt;  SmartAction will use AI in the future to excel chat support, advance intelligent voice automation and improve the IVR interaction experience for the consumer through omni-bot technology.  https://www.smartaction.ai/research-and-insights/omni-bot/.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8528">:''Not to be confused with [[statuary]], [[statutory]] etc.''

'''Statary''' is a term currently applied in fields such as [[ecology]], [[ethology]], [[psychology]]. In modern use it contrasts on the one hand with such concepts as ''migratory'', ''nomadic'', or ''shifting'', and on the other with ''static'' or ''immobile''. The word also is of historical interest in its change of meaning as its usage changed.

==Current usage==
In current usage in fields such as biology, '''[[Wiktionary:statary|statary]]''' commonly means ''in a particular location or state, '''but not rigidly so'''''. [[Army ant]] colonies for example are said to be in a ''statary phase'' when they occupy one bivouac for an extended period instead of just overnight. This is as opposed to a ''nomadic phase'', in which they travel and forage practically daily. This does not mean that ant colonies in a statary phase do not move nor even that they do not forage while statary; they often do both, sometimes daily. Correspondingly a colony in a nomadic phase does not travel without rest; it bivouacs for the night. The significance of the terms is that the colonies' behaviour patterns differ radically according to their activity phase; one pattern favours maintaining a persistent presence where brood is being raised, whereas the other favours continual nomadic wandering into new foraging grounds.&lt;ref name="MSPP"&gt;Maier, Norman Raymond Frederick; Schneirla, Théodore Christian. Principles of animal psychology. McGraw-Hill 1935&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "AAGWH"&gt;Gotwald, William H. Army Ants: The Biology of Social Predation. Publisher: Cornell University Press 1995. {{ISBN|978-0801426339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such phases have raised interest in studies in aspects of comparative psychology&lt;ref&gt;Oyama, Susan; Griffths, Paul E.; Gray, Russell D. (editors) Cycles of Contingency: Developmental Systems and Evolution. 2001 {{ISBN|0-262-15053-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Reeson, A. F.; Wilson, K.; Gunn,  A.; Hails,  R. S.; Goulson, D. Baculovirus resistance in the noctuid Spodoptera exempta is phenotypically plastic and responds to population density. doi: 10.1098/rspb.1998.0503 Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 22 September 1998 vol. 265 no. 1407 1787-1791&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''statary'' also applies in contexts other than ants or colonial organisms. Swarm-forming species of [[locust]]s go beyond having statary and nomadic phases of behaviour; their growing [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]] actually develop into different adult morphologies, depending on whether the conditions during their growth favour swarming or not. Locusts that adopt the swarming morphology are said to be the migratory [[Polymorphism (biology)|morphs]], while the rest are called statary morphs.&lt;ref name="MJWEDPE"&gt;West-Eberhard, Mary Jane. Developmental Plasticity and Evolution. Publisher: Oxford University Press 2003. {{ISBN|978-0195122350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively similar morphs occur in some other insect species, such as [[Fall armyworm|army worm]].&lt;ref name="LIR"&gt;Leather, Hardie, Jim. Insect Reproduction. Publisher: CRC Press 1995. {{ISBN|978-0849366956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some technical fields ''statary'' need not refer literally to location or motion, but refer figuratively to their having particular characteristic but non-rigid attributes, such as atmospheric pressure. The following section instances examples of such senses occurring in the history of the term.

==Historical usage==
'''Statary''', from the Latin root ''statarius'', meaning  "standing fast", first came into prominent use in the English language in ''Positions'', the work of [[Richard Mulcaster]] in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=OEDJHM&gt;Murray, J.A.H. The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (2 vols). Publisher: Oxford University Press. 1971. {{ISBN|978-0198611172}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke of ''statarie substance'' much as, in contemporary English, one might speak of [[fixed asset]]s or fixed property: "...either rich or poore : landed or unlanded, which is either the having or wanting of the most '''statarie''' substance." It is unclear whether he coined the English version of the word.

[[Samuel Collins (theologian)|Samuel Collins]] also used the word "statary" in the slightly different sense of "ordinary" or "normal" in his 1617 defence of the Bishop of Elie, [[Lancelot Andrewes]]: "What is this [in comparison], ... not ... to their stately, but even statarie and ordinarie supremacie in the Church?".

In his ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica''&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Thomas, Sir, (ed. Wilkin, Simon). The works of Sir Thomas Browne Vol 2. Pub. London : G. Bell. 1888) [Download from: https://archive.org/details/worksofsirthomas02brow]&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Thomas Browne]] used the word in at least two senses; firstly he used it as meaning ''fixed'' or ''regular'', as in "...perturbed the observation of festivities and '''''statary''''' solemnities..." secondly he used it in contrast to ''anniversary'' (by which he meant "annual" or "seasonal") as in: "...we might expect a regularity in the winds ; whereof though some be statary, some anniversary, and the rest do tend to determine points of heaven, yet do the blasts and undulary breaths thereof maintain no certainty in their course..." In this passage he explicitly does not assert the self-contradiction that winds might be static, but rather that they are unceasing, though variable. In this sense Browne's usage is consistent with the modern technical application.

The word ''statary'' appeared in sundry works after Browne's time, for example in the [[Literary Gazette]] in the ''Meteorological Journal'', the word was used in reference to winds and barometric readings in much the same sense as that in which Browne had referred to statary winds.&lt;ref&gt;William Jerdan, Lovell Augustus Reeve et al (eds) The Literary gazette: A weekly journal of literature, science, and the fine arts, Volume 5 (Google eBook) 1821, Meteorological Journal, pp. 527, 752&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lancelot Addison]] referred to "statary prayers" in his account of his seven years in West Barbary, published in 1671. However, the word never seems to have come into common use, though it did appear in various dictionaries, such as [[Samuel Johnson]]'s 1755 [[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]. Such entries did not generally refer to any distinction between the various senses, and in fact some used words such as "stationary" in their definitions, apparently feeling no need for a separate term for the concept of something that has a non-rigid general location around specific coordinates. Accordingly the word was marked as obsolete by the compilers of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] published in the late 19th to early 20th century,&lt;ref name=OEDJHM/&gt; and [[Webster's Dictionary]] did likewise in the 1913 unabridged edition.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Noah. Webster's revised unabridged dictionary of the English language. Publisher: Merriam 1913&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]] in turn omitted the entry altogether.&lt;ref name= "isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it had not been resurrected in the role of a technical term, the word ''statary'' probably would have disappeared from the language by now. In the sense of "rigidly stationary" it patently is redundant, but in the sense of loosely remaining at particular coordinates, it fills a need in certain fields such as in biology and climatology.

A related sense appeared in the 1623 translation of [[Xenophon]] by John Bingham.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, (tr. Bingham, John). The Historie of Xenophon. 1623. Publ: Theatrum Orbis Terrarum. {{ISBN|9789022107041}}&lt;/ref&gt; As applied to soldiers, statary means: equipped for stationary combat as opposed to [[Skirmisher|skirmishing]].&lt;ref name=OEDJHM/&gt;

Eventually, about the early 1930s, the word began to reappear in articles and textbooks, particularly on biological topics. For example, it was used in a prominent textbook of the day,&lt;ref name="MSPP"/&gt; [[Norman Maier]] and associates were applying the concept to ant behaviour; it seems that [[Myrmecology|T. C. Schneirla]] had elected to use the term in 1932. It had proved useful, and by the end of the 20th century the word was in fairly common use, as can be seen from [[Google Ngram Viewer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6014">The songs of [[Zion]] ({{lang-he|צִיּוֹן}}), ''i.e.'', the lyrical hymns which express the longing of the Jewish nation to see the hill of Zion and the city of [[Jerusalem]] shine again in all their former glory, date back to the time immediately after the destruction of [[Solomon's Temple]]. Since that period the poets and singers of [[Israel]] have devoted their best talent to painting in the most brilliant colors the ancient glories of Zion. 

By far the greater number of these songs unite in voicing a heartfelt desire to see the nation, the city of Jerusalem, [[Mount Zion]], and the Temple restored to their former splendor.

== Oldest songs ==
The oldest song of Zion in Jewish literature was written in the fifth century B.C., and is a lamentation that the enemy compels Israel to live on foreign soil; this is the celebrated [[Psalm]] cxxxvii. 1-3. A similar Zionide of the same period is Ps. cxxvi.; in it the poet, full of hope, sings of the day when the Captivity shall be over and the joyfully returning exiles shall sing a new song of Zion. The elegy ending with a desire for deliverance, which is found in the fifth chapter of [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], dates probably from the first pre-Christian century.

== Middle Ages - Ibn Gabirol ==

During the [[Middle Ages]], Zionides from the pens of the greatest poets formed the chief comfort and consolation of the people. As early as the time of [[Ibn Gabirol]] (11th century) songs of Zion were incorporated in the liturgy, partly as lamentations for the Ninth of Ab and partly as tefillot and [[piyyut|piyyut'im]]. Among the songs of lamentation for Zion which are sung on the Ninth of Ab the following may be specially referred to: a song beginning with the words ''{{lang|he|בליל זה יבכיון ויילילו בני}}'' and giving a vivid description of the destruction of Zion; the well-known song which begins with the words ''{{lang|he|עוני שמרון קול תתן מצאוני}}'', and in which [[Samaria]] and [[Jerusalem]] try to excel each other in the description of the misfortune which has fallen upon them; and, above all, the song with the refrain:

{| style="font-size="20px;"" align="center"
|-----
|
|}

::''("Zion and her cities wail like a woman in childbirth, and like a virgin clothed in sackcloth for the man of her youthful choice")''. Of other tefillot and piyyut'im may be mentioned the song beginning:

{| style="font-size="20px;"" align="center"
|-----
|
|}

and several strophes of the song "[[Lekah Dodi]]", composed by [[Solomon ha-Levi]] and incorporated in the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] eve service.

The most important of Ibn Gabirol's Zionides are the poem beginning with the words:

{| style="font-size="20px;"" align="center"
|-----
|
|}

::''("Send a prince to the condemned people which is scattered hither and thither")'' and that beginning:

{| style="font-size="20px;"" align="center"
|-----
|
|}

::("Turn thy face, O God, to the conquered, who is delivered up into the hand of Babel and of Seir").

[[Judah ha-Levi]] (1140) was the author of the Zionide beginning:

{| style="font-size="20px;"" align="center"
|-----
|
|}

''"Zion, wilt thou not send a greeting to thy captives, Who greet thee as the remnant of thy flocks? From West to East, from North to South, a greeting, From far and near, take thou on all sides. A greeting sends the captive of desire, who sheds his tears Like dew on Hermon; would they might fall on thy hills."''

Besides this song, which has been translated into nearly all European languages in prose and in verse, Judah wrote several shorter songs, chief of which are ''("My heart is in the East, although I am at the end of the West")'' and 
::''("Sigh, O Jerusalem, and shed thy tears, O Zion")''.

== Various authors ==

Among other medieval writers of this class may be mentioned Abraham ibn Ezra, who composed the Zionide ''("O God, who art enthroned in the East, appease the mourning dove")''; [[Judah al-Ḥarizi]] (13th century), author of the song ("Peace be to the city of Salem [[Jerusalem]]"); and [[Israel Najara]] (16th century), who wrote the song ''("May the flower of salvation bloom like a palm")''. 

In more modern times [[Samuel David Luzzatto]] wrote:
{| style="font-size="20px;"" align="center"
|-----
|
|}
::''("My heart, my heart is full of pain; see, my grief is an ancient one")''; 

Equally well known is [[Joseph Almanzi]]'s
{| style="font-size="20px;"" align="center"
|-----
|
|}
::''("From all corners comes rejoicing on the day of celebration to God, who is good")''.

The most prominent Hebrew poets have written Zionides, among the number being [[M. S. Rabener]], [[Micah Levisohn]], [[Judah Loeb Gordon]], [[S. Mandelkern]], [[M. M. Dolitzky]], and [[N. H. Imber]]. 
Countless songs have been produced under the influence of Zionism: of these may be mentioned the song adopted by all the Zionists of the world as their national song, and beginning with the words "There, where a slender cedar kisses the clouds"; the song of the academic society Kadimah in Austria, "Knowest thou whence freedom comes"?; 
the song of the united Zionists, "Sluchajcie bracia gueśni tij"; and "[[Hatikva|hatTiqwah]]" (Hope), composed by [[N. H. Imber]], which has the refrain:
{| style="font-size="20px;"" align="center"
|-----
|
|}
::''("Our hope has not yet gone, the old hope to return to the land of our fathers, to the city where David lived")''.
