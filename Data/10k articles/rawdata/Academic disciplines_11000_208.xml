'''Aerial stem modifications''' are modifications to the aerial stems, vegetative buds and floral buds of plants growing in different conditions and which perform functions such as climbing, protection, synthesis of food, or vegetative propagation. Aerial stem structures that undergo modifications to perform these special functions include tendrils, thorns, hooks, [[phylloclade]], [[tuberous stem]]s and [[bulbil]]s. The auxiliary or the terminal part of the modified structures show their stem nature.

== Tendrils ==
Some weak stemmed plants produce wiry, coiled, sensitive and delicate organs for climbing. They are called tendrils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms|last=Hickey|first=Michael|last2=King|first2=Clive|date=2000-11-16|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=0Yja1lL_pJYC&amp;pg=PA41|isbn=9780521794015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may develop from either the axillary bud or the terminal bud of the stem. In ''[[Passiflora]]'', the tendrils develop from the axillary bud. In ''[[Cissus quadrangularis]]'' and in ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'' the terminal bud develops into tendrils.

== Thorns ==
These are hard, woody, pointed structures meant for protection. They are provided with [[vascular tissue]], which may develop from the axillary bud or terminal buds. They control [[transpiration]] by reducing the vegetative growth.
In ''[[Bougainvillae]], [[Punica granatum]] and [[Duranta]]'' the axillary bud develop into thorns. In ''Duranta'', the thorns are provided with leaves and flowers. In ''Punica granatum'', the thorns bear leaves and branches. In ''[[Carissa carandas]]'' the terminal bud produces a pair of thorns. They help in protection.

== Bulbils ==
When axillary bud becomes fleshy and rounded due to storage of food, it is called bulbil. It gets detached from the plant, falls on ground and develops into a new plant. e.g. ''[[Dioscorea]]''. It is in axel (the space between leaf and stem)

== Cladode ==
These are green branches of limited growth (usually one internode long) which have taken up the functions of photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms|last=Hickey|first=Michael|last2=King|first2=Clive|date=2000-11-16|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=0Yja1lL_pJYC&amp;pg=PA8|isbn=9780521794015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; True leaves are reduced to scales or spines, e.g. ''[[Asparagus]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2592">In [[computational complexity theory]], '''asymptotic computational complexity''' is the usage of [[asymptotic analysis]] for the estimation of computational complexity of [[algorithm]]s and [[computational problem]]s, commonly associated with the usage of the [[big O notation]]. 

==Scope==
With respect to [[computational resource]]s, '''asymptotic [[time complexity]]''' and '''asymptotic [[space complexity]]''' are commonly estimated.  Other asymptotically estimated behavior include [[circuit complexity]] and various measures of [[parallel computation]], such as the number of (parallel) processors.

Since the ground-breaking 1965 paper by [[Juris Hartmanis]] and [[Richard E. Stearns]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hartmanis | first1 = J. | last2 = Stearns | first2 = R. E. | doi = 10.1090/S0002-9947-1965-0170805-7 | title = On the computational complexity of algorithms | journal = Transactions of the American Mathematical Society | volume = 117 | pages = 285–306 | year = 1965 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1979 book by [[Michael Garey]] and [[David S. Johnson]] on [[NP-completeness]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S. Johnson]]: ''Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness.'' New York: W. H. Freeman &amp; Co., 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; the term "[[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]]" (of algorithms) has become commonly referred to as asymptotic computational complexity. 

Further, unless specified otherwise, the term "computational complexity" usually refers to the [[upper bound]] for the asymptotic computational complexity of an algorithm or a problem, which is usually written in terms of the big O notation, e.g.. &lt;math&gt;O(n^3).&lt;/math&gt; Other types of (asymptotic) computational complexity estimates are [[lower bound]]s ("[[Big O notation|Big Omega]]" notation; e.g.,  Ω(''n'')) and asymptotically tight estimates, when the asymptotic upper and lower bounds coincide (written using the "[[big Theta]]"; e.g., Θ(''n'' log ''n'')).

A further [[tacit assumption]] is that the [[worst case analysis]] of computational complexity is in question unless stated otherwise. An alternative approach is [[probabilistic analysis of algorithms]].

==Types of algorithms considered==
In most practical cases [[deterministic algorithm]]s or [[randomized algorithm]]s are discussed, although [[theoretical computer science]] also considers [[nondeterministic algorithm]]s and other advanced [[models of computation]].

Although the burgage plot was used for small scale activities such as livestock or orchards, the back lane frequently divided the village from the main agricultural area - such as the [[open field system|open fields]].

The name frequently survives as a street name in a much enlarged urban settlement (there is an example in [[Wheldrake]]), although it is not uncommon for the back lane to be reduced to a narrow pathway.

A back lane, laneway, or [[alley]] is also a service, or access road behind houses, or in a commercial district, which was created for deliveries and parking, amongst other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.surrey.ca/city-services/758.aspx|title = Back Lanes|website = City of Surrey|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blastula (PSF).jpg|thumb|[[Blastocoel]] and [[blastoderm]]]]
The '''blastula''' (from Greek ''[[wikt:βλαστός#Greek|βλαστός]]'' (blastos), meaning "[[sprout (disambiguation)|sprout]]") is a hollow sphere of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, referred to as [[blastomere]]s, surrounding an inner fluid-filled cavity called the [[blastocoele]] formed during an early stage of [[embryonic development]] in [[animal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2013 |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Blastula|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/69108/blastula}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Embryo]] development begins with a sperm fertilizing an egg to become a [[zygote]] which undergoes many [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavages]] to develop into a ball of cells called a [[morula]]. Only when the blastocoele is formed does the early embryo become a blastula. The blastula precedes the formation of the [[gastrula]] in which the [[germ layer]]s of the embryo form.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Scott|title=Developmental Biology 9th Ed + Devbio Labortatory Vade Mecum3.|year=2010|publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc.|isbn=978-0-87893-558-1|pages=243–247, 161|url=http://ebooks.sinauer.com/gilbert9e/text.php}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common feature of a [[vertebrate]] blastula is that it consists of a layer of blastomeres, known as the [[blastoderm]], which surrounds the blastocoele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lombardi, Julian|chapter=Embryogenesis|title=Comparative vertebrate reproduction|publisher=Springer|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7923-8336-9|page=226|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqQX9RMPAegC&amp;pg=PA226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forgács &amp; Newman, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=rUyVWQhk7CkC&amp;pg=PA27 p. 27]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mammal]]s the blastula is referred to as a [[blastocyst]]. The blastocyst contains an [[embryoblast]] (or inner cell mass) that will eventually give rise to the definitive structures of the fetus, and the [[trophoblast]], which goes on to form the extra-embryonic tissues.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cockburn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cockburn|first=Katie|author2=Rossant, Janet|title=Making the blastocyst: lessons from the mouse|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|date=1 April 2010|volume=120|issue=4|pages=995–1003|doi=10.1172/JCI41229|pmid=20364097|pmc=2846056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the blastula stage of development, a significant amount of activity occurs within the early embryo to establish [[cell polarity]], [[cell fate determination|cell specification]], [[regional specification|axis formation]], and regulate [[gene expression]].&lt;ref name=Heasman /&gt; In many animals such as ''[[Drosophila]]'' and ''[[Xenopus]]'', the [[midblastula|mid blastula transition]] (MBT) is a crucial step in development during which the [[maternal effect|maternal mRNA]] is degraded and control over development is passed to the embryo.&lt;ref name="Tadros 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tadros|first=Wael|author2=Lipshitz, Howard D.|title=Setting the stage for development: mRNA translation and stability during oocyte maturation and egg activation in ''Drosophila'' |journal=Developmental Dynamics|date=1 March 2004|volume=232|issue=3|pages=593–608|doi=10.1002/dvdy.20297|pmid=15704150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the interactions between blastomeres are dependent on [[cadherin]] expression, particularly [[CDH1 (gene)|E-cadherin]] in mammals and EP-cadherin in amphibians.&lt;ref name=Heasman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heasman|first=J|title=Patterning the ''Xenopus'' blastula |journal=Development|date=November 1997|volume=124|issue=21|pages=4179–91|pmid=9334267|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/124/21/4179.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the blastula and of cell specification has many implications on the field of [[embryonic stem cells|stem cell]] research as well as the continued improvement of [[assisted reproductive technology|fertility treatments]].&lt;ref name=Cockburn /&gt; Embryonic stem cells are a field which, though controversial, have tremendous potential for treating disease. In ''Xenopus'', blastomeres behave as [[Cell potency|pluripotent]] stem cells which can migrate down several pathways, depending on [[cell signaling]].&lt;ref name=Gurdon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gourdon|first=John B.|author2=Standley, Henrietta J.|title=Uncommitted ''Xenopus'' blastula cells can be directed to uniform muscle gene expression by gradient interpretation and a community effect|journal=The International Journal of Developmental Biology (Cambridge, UK)|volume=46|issue=8|pages=993–8|pmid=12533022|url=http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/paper.php?doi=12533022|date=December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; By manipulating the cell signals during the blastula stage of development, various tissues can be formed. This potential can be instrumental in [[regenerative medicine]] for disease and injury cases. [[In vitro fertilisation]] involves implantation of a blastula into a mother's uterus.&lt;ref name=Toth&gt;{{cite web|last=Toth|first=Attila|title=Treatment: Addressing the Causes of Infertility in Men and Women|url=http://www.fertilitysolution.com/Infertility/Treatment.html|publisher=Macleod Laboratory|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blastula cell implantation could serve to eliminate [[infertility]].

== Development ==
The blastula stage of early embryo development begins with the appearance of the blastocoel. The origin of the blastocoele in ''Xenopus'' has been shown to be from the first [[cleavage furrow]], which is widened and sealed with [[tight junctions]] to create a cavity.&lt;ref name="Kalt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalt|first=MR|title=The relationship between cleavage and blastocoel formation in ''[[Xenopus laevis]]''. I. Light microscopic observations.|journal=Journal of Embryology and Experimental Morphology|date=August 1971|volume=26|issue=1|pages=37–49|pmid=5565077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many organisms the development of the embryo up to this point and for the early part of the blastula stage is controlled by maternal mRNA, so called because it was produced in the egg prior to fertilization and is therefore exclusively from the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tadros|first=W|author2=Lipshitz, HD|title=Setting the stage for development: mRNA translation and stability during oocyte maturation and egg activation in ''Drosophila'' |journal=Developmental Dynamics|date=March 2005|volume=232|issue=3|pages=593–608|pmid=15704150|doi=10.1002/dvdy.20297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Etkin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etkin|first=LD|title=Regulation of the mid-blastula transition in amphibians.|journal=Developmental Biology|year=1988|volume=5|pages=209–25|pmid=3077975|doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-6817-9_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mid-blastula transition ===
In many organisms including ''Xenopus'' and ''Drosophila'', the [[Midblastula|mid-blastula transition]] usually occurs after a particular number of cell divisions for a given species, and is defined by the ending of the synchronous cell division cycles of the early blastula development, and the lengthening of the [[cell cycle]]s by the addition of the [[G1 phase|G1]] and [[G2 phase]]s.  Prior to this transition, cleavage occurs with only the synthesis and mitosis phases of the cell cycle.&lt;ref name=Etkin /&gt; The addition of the two growth phases into the cell cycle allows for the cells to increase in size, as up to this point the blastomeres undergo reductive divisions in which the overall size of the embryo does not increase, but more cells are created. This transition begins the growth in size of the organism.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;

The mid-blastula transition is also characterised by a marked increase in [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of new, non-maternal mRNA transcribed from the genome of the organism. Large amounts of the maternal mRNA are destroyed at this point, either by proteins such as [[Smaug|SMAUG]] in ''Drosophila''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tadros|first=W|author2=Westwood, JT |author3=Lipshitz, HD |title=The mother-to-child transition.|journal=Developmental Cell|date=June 2007|volume=12|issue=6|pages=847–9|pmid=17543857|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2007.05.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by [[microRNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weigel|first=D|author2=Izaurralde, E|title=A tiny helper lightens the maternal load.|journal=Cell|date=24 March 2006|volume=124|issue=6|pages=1117–8|pmid=16564001|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two processes shift the control of the embryo from the maternal mRNA to the nuclei.

== Structure ==
A blastula is a sphere of cells surrounding a blastocoele. The blastocoele is a fluid filled cavity which contains [[amino acid]]s, [[protein]]s, [[growth factor]]s, sugars, ions and other components which are necessary for [[cellular differentiation]]. The blastocoele also allows blastomeres to move during the process of [[gastrulation]].&lt;ref name=Fleming&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fleming|first=Tom P.|author2=Papenbrock, Tom |author3=Fesenko, Irina |author4=Hausen, Peter |author5= Sheth, Bhavwanti |title=Assembly of tight junctions during early vertebrate development|journal=Seminars in Cell &amp; Developmental Biology|date=1 August 2000|volume=11|issue=4|pages=291–299|doi=10.1006/scdb.2000.0179|pmid=10966863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Xenopus'' embryos, the blastula is composed of three different regions. The animal cap forms the roof of the blastocoele and goes on primarily to form [[ectoderm]]al derivatives. The equatorial or marginal zone, which compose the walls of the blastocoel differentiate primarily into [[mesoderm]]al tissue. The vegetal mass is composed of the blastocoel floor and primarily develops into [[endoderm]]al tissue.&lt;ref name=Heasman /&gt;

In the mammalian blastocyst (term for mammalian blastula) there are three lineages that give rise to later tissue development. The [[epiblast]] gives rise to the fetus itself while the trophoblast develops into part of the [[placenta]] and the primitive endoderm becomes the [[yolk sac]].&lt;ref name=Cockburn /&gt;

In mouse embryo, blastocoele formation begins at the 32-cell stage. During this process, water enters the embryo, aided by an osmotic gradient which is the result of [[sodium potassium ATPase|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPases]] that produce a high Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; gradient on the basolateral side of the trophectoderm. This movement of water is facilitated by [[aquaporin]]s.  A seal is created by tight junctions of the [[epithelium|epithelial cells]] that line the blastocoele.&lt;ref name=Cockburn /&gt;

=== Cellular adhesion ===
Tight junctions are very important in embryo development. In the blastula, these cadherin mediated cell interactions are essential to development of epithelium which are most important to [[paracellular transport]], maintenance of cell polarity and the creation of a permeability seal to regulate blastocoel formation. These tight junctions arise after the polarity of epithelial cells is established which sets the foundation for further development and specification. Within the blastula, inner blastomeres are generally non-polar while epithelial cells demonstrate polarity.&lt;ref name=Fleming /&gt;

Mammalian embryos undergo compaction around the 8-cell stage where [[CDH1 (gene)|E-cadherins]] as well as [[alpha catenin|alpha]] and [[beta catenin|beta]] [[catenin]]s are expressed. This process makes a ball of embryonic cells which are capable of interacting, rather than a group of diffuse and undifferentiated cells. E-cadherin adhesion defines the [[epithelial polarity|apico-basal axis]] in the developing embryo and turns the embryo from an indistinct ball of  to a more polarized [[phenotype]] which sets the stage for further development into a fully formed blastocyst.&lt;ref name=Fleming /&gt;

''Xenopus'' membrane polarity is established with the first cell cleavage. Amphibian EP-cadherin and XB/U cadherin perform a similar role as E-cadherin in mammals establishing blastomere polarity and solidifying cell-cell interactions which are crucial for further development.&lt;ref name=Fleming /&gt;

== Clinical implications ==
=== Fertilization technologies ===

Experiments with implantation in mice show that [[Ovulation induction|hormonal induction]], [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|superovulation]] and [[artificial insemination]] successfully produce preimplantion mice embryos. In the mice, ninety percent of the females were induced by mechanical stimulation to undergo pregnancy and implant at least one embryo.&lt;ref name= Watson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=J.G.|title=Collection and Transfer of Preimplantation Mouse Embryos|journal=Biology of Reproduction|volume=17|issue=3|pmid=901897 |date=October 1977|pages=453–8|doi=10.1095/biolreprod17.3.453}}&lt;!--|accessdate= 1 April 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These results prove to be encouraging because they provide a basis for potential implantation in other mammalian species, such as humans.

=== Stem cells ===
Blastula-stage cells can behave as pluripotent stem cells in many species. Pluripotent stem cells are the starting point to produce organ specific cells that can potentially aid in repair and prevention of injury and degeneration. Combining the expression of [[transcription factor]]s and locational positioning of the blastula cells can lead to the development of induced functional organs and tissues. Pluripotent ''Xenopus'' cells, when used in an in vivo strategy, were able to form into functional [[retina]]s. By transplanting them to the eye field on the [[neural plate]], and by inducing several mis-expressions of transcription factors, the cells were committed to the retinal lineage and could guide vision based behavior in the ''Xenopus''.&lt;ref name=Viczian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Viczian|first=Andrea S.|author2=Solessio, Eduardo C. |author3=Lyou, Yung |author4= Zuber, Michael E |title=Generation of Functional Eyes from Pluripotent Cells|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=7|issue=8|pmid=19688031 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000174|date=August 2009|pages=e1000174 |pmc=2716519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[Image:Bolted joint 2.svg|thumb|150px|Screw joint|right]]
 [[Image:Bolted joint 1.svg|thumb|150px|Stud joint|right]]

'''Bolted joints''' are one of the most common elements in [[construction]] and machine design. They consist of [[fastener]]s that capture and join other parts, and are secured with the mating of [[screw thread]]s.

There are two main types of bolted joint designs: tension joints and shear joints.

In the tension joint, the bolt and clamped components of the joint are designed to transfer an applied tension load through the joint by way of the clamped components by the design of a proper balance of joint and bolt stiffness. The joint should be designed such that the clamp load is never overcome by the external tension [[force]]s acting to separate the joint. If the external tension forces overcome the clamp load (bolt preload) the clamped joint components will separate, allowing relative motion of the components.

The second type of bolted joint transfers the applied load in shear of the bolt shank and relies on the [[shear strength]] of the bolt. Tension loads on such a joint are only incidental. A preload is still applied but consideration of joint flexibility is not as critical as in the case where loads are transmitted through the joint in tension. Other such shear joints do not employ a preload on the bolt as they are designed to allow rotation of the joint about the bolt, but use other methods of maintaining bolt/joint integrity. Joints that allow rotation include [[Clevis pin|clevis]] linkages, and rely on a locking mechanism (like [[lock washer]]s, thread [[adhesive]]s, and lock [[nut (hardware)|nuts]]).

Proper joint design and bolt preload provides useful properties:
* For cyclic tension loads, the fastener is not subjected to the full amplitude of the load; as a result, the fastener's [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] life is increased or—if the material exhibits an [[endurance limit]] its life extends indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt;
* As long as the external tension loads on a joint do not exceed the clamp load, the fastener is not subjected to motion that would loosen it, obviating the need for locking mechanisms. (Questionable under Vibration Inputs.)
*For the shear joint, a proper clamping force on the joint components prevents relative motion of those components and the [[fretting]] wear of those that could result in the development of fatigue cracks.

In both the tension and shear joint design cases, some level of tension preload in the bolt and resulting compression preload in the clamped components is essential to the joint integrity. The preload target can be achieved by a variety of methods: applying a measured [[torque]] to the bolt, measuring bolt extension, heating to expand the bolt then turning the nut down, torquing the bolt to the yield point, testing ultrasonically, or by applying a certain number of degrees of relative rotation of the threaded components. Each method has a range of uncertainties associated with it, some of which are very substantial.

== Theory ==
Typically, a bolt is tensioned (preloaded) by the application of a torque to either the bolt head or the nut. The applied torque causes the bolt to "climb" the thread causing a tensioning of the bolt and an equivalent compression in the components being fastened by the bolt. The preload developed in a bolt is due to the applied torque and is a function of the bolt diameter, the geometry of the threads, and the coefficients of friction that exist in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut. The stiffness of the components clamped by the bolt has no relation to the preload that is developed by the torque. The relative stiffness of the bolt and the clamped joint components do, however, determine the fraction of the external tension load that the bolt will carry and that in turn determines preload needed to prevent joint separation and by that means to reduce the range of stress the bolt experiences as the tension load is repeatedly applied. This determines the durability of the bolt when subjected to repeated tension loads. Maintaining a sufficient joint preload also prevents relative slippage of the joint components that would produce fretting wear that could result in a fatigue failure of those parts.
  
[[Image:Bolted joint spring analogy.svg|440px|right]]

The clamp load, also called preload of a fastener, is created when a torque is applied, and so develops a tensile preload that is generally a substantial percentage of the fastener's [[screw|proof strength]]. Fasteners are manufactured to various standards that define, among other things, their strength. ''Torque charts'' are available to specify the required torque for a given fastener based on its ''property class'' (fineness of manufacture and fit) and ''grade'' (tensile strength).

When a fastener is torqued, a tension preload develops in the bolt and an equal compressive preload develops in the parts being fastened. This can be [[Scientific modelling|modeled]] as a spring-like assembly that has some assumed distribution of compressive strain in the clamped joint components. When an external tension load is applied, it relieves the compressive strains induced by the preload in the clamped components, hence the preload acting on the compressed joint components provides the external tension load with a path (through the joint) other than through the bolt. In a well designed joint, perhaps 80-90% of the externally applied tension load will pass through the joint and the remainder through the bolt. This reduces the fatigue loading of the bolt.

When the fastened parts are less stiff than the fastener (those that use soft, compressed gaskets for example), this model breaks down and the fastener is subjected to a tension load that is the sum of the tension preload and the external tension load.

In some applications, joints are designed so that the fastener eventually fails before more expensive components. In this case, replacing an existing fastener with a higher strength fastener can result in equipment damage. Thus, it is generally good practice to replace old fasteners with new fasteners of the same grade.

== Calculating the torque ==
Engineered joints require the torque to be chosen to provide the correct tension preload. Applying the torque to fasteners is commonly achieved using a [[torque wrench]].&lt;ref name="oberg1495"&gt;{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|McCauley|Heald|2004|p=1495}}&lt;/ref&gt; The required torque value for a particular fastener application may be quoted in the published standard document, defined by the manufacturer or calculated.  The side of the threaded fastening having the least friction should receive torque while the other side is counter-held or otherwise prevented from turning.

A common relationship used to calculate the torque for a desired preload takes into account the thread geometry and friction in the threads and under the bolt head or nut. The following assumes standard ISO or National Standard bolts and threads are used:

:&lt;math&gt;T = K P_{pre} d &lt;/math&gt;

where 
:&lt;math&gt;T &lt;/math&gt; is the required torque
:&lt;math&gt;K &lt;/math&gt; is the nut factor
:&lt;math&gt;P_{pre} &lt;/math&gt; is the desired preload
:&lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; is the bolt diameter

The nut factor K accounts for the thread geometry, friction, pitch. When ISO and Unified National Standard threads are used the nut factor is:&lt;ref name=Shigley/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{d_{m}}{2 d}\,\left(\frac{ \tan \psi +\mu  \sec \alpha} { 1 - \mu \tan \psi \sec \alpha}\right) + 0.625 \mu_{c}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt; d_{m} &lt;/math&gt; = the mean thread diameter, close to pitch diameter.
:&lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; = nominal bolt diameter
:&lt;math&gt; \tan\psi &lt;/math&gt; = [[fastener|(thread pitch)]]/(pi * d&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;)
:Thread Pitch = 1/N  where N is the number of threads per inch or mm
:&lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; = friction coefficient in the threads
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; = half the thread angle (typically 60°) = 30° 
:&lt;math&gt; \mu_{c}&lt;/math&gt; = friction coefficient under torqued head or nut

When &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt; \mu_{c}&lt;/math&gt; = 0.15, the dimensions used correspond to any size coarse or fine bolt, and the nut factor is K ≈ 0.20, the torque/preload relationship becomes

:&lt;math&gt;T = 0.20 P_{pre} d &lt;/math&gt;

A study of the effect of torquing two samples, one lubricated and the other unlubricated, 1/2 in.- 20 UNF bolts to 800&amp;nbsp;lb-in, produced the same mean preload of 7700&amp;nbsp;lbf. The preloads for the unlubricated bolt sample had a standard deviation from the mean value of 1100&amp;nbsp;lbf, whereas the lubricated sample had a standard deviation of 680&amp;nbsp;lbf. If the preload value and torques are used in the above relation to solve for the nut factor it is found to be K = 0.208, which is very close to the recommended value of 0.20

The preferred bolt preload for structural applications should be at least 75% of the fastener's proof load&lt;ref name="oberg1495"/&gt; for the higher strength fasteners and as high as 90% of the proof load for permanent fasteners. To achieve the benefits of the preloading, the clamping force must be higher than the joint separation load. For some joints, multiple fasteners are required to secure the joint; these are all hand tightened before the final torque is applied to ensure an even joint seating.

The preload achieved by torquing a bolt is caused by the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.

Either the bolt head or the nut can be torqued. If one has a larger bearing area or coefficient of friction it will require more torque to provide the same target preload.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolt Science|url=http://www.boltscience.com/pages/faq.htm#3|work=Bolt Science Limited|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fasteners should only be torqued if they are fitted in [[wiktionary:clearance hole|clearance hole]]s.

Torque wrenches do not give a direct measurement of the preload in the bolt.

More accurate methods for determining the preload rely on defining or measuring the ''screw extension'' from the nut. Alternatively, measurement of the angular rotation of the nut can serve as the basis for defining screw extension based on the fastener's [[thread pitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|McCauley|Heald|2004|p=1499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measuring the screw extension directly allows the clamping force to be very accurately calculated. This can be achieved using a [[dial test indicator]], reading deflection at the fastener tail, using a [[strain gauge]], or ultrasonic length measurement.

Bolt preload can also be controlled by torquing the bolt to the point of yielding. Under some circumstances, a skilled operator can feel the drop off of the work required to turn the torque wrench as the material of the bolt begins to yield. At that point the bolt has a preload determined by the bolt area and the  yield strength of the bolt material. This technique can be more accurately executed by specially built machines. Because this method only works for very high preloads and requires comparatively expensive tooling, it is only commonly used for specific applications, primarily in high performance engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highpowermedia.com/blog/3358/tightening-to-yield |title=Tightening to yield |publisher=High Power Media |date= |accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boltscience.com/pages/tighten.htm |title=Methods of Tightening Threaded Fasteners |publisher=Boltscience.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no simple method to measure the tension of a fastener already in place other than to tighten it and identify at which point the fastener starts extending. This is known as ''re-torqueing''. An electronic torque wrench can be used on the fastener in question, so that the torque applied can be constantly measured as it is slowly increased in magnitude.

Recent developments enable tensions to be estimated by using ultrasonic testing. Another way to ensure correct tension (mainly in erecting steel) involves the use of crush-washers. These are washers that have been drilled and filled with orange [[Vulcanization#Room temperature vulcanization|RTV]]. When the orange rubber strands appear, the tension is correct.

Large-volume users (such as auto makers) frequently use computer-controlled [[nut driver]]s. With such machines, the computer in effect plots a graph of the torque exerted. Once the torque reaches a set maximum torque chosen by the designer, the machine stops.  Such machines are often used to fit wheelnuts and normally tighten all the wheel nuts simultaneously.

==Thread engagement==
''Thread engagement'' is the length or number of threads that are engaged between the screw and the female threads. Bolted joints are designed so that the bolt shank fails in tension before the threads fail in shear, but for this to hold true, a minimum thread engagement must be achieved. The following equation defines this minimum thread engagement:
&lt;ref name="threadengagement"&gt;{{Citation

:&lt;math&gt;L_e = \frac{2 \times A_t}{0.5 \pi \left( D - 0.64952 p \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where L&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the thread engagement length, A&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is the tensile stress area, D is the major diameter of the screw, and p is the pitch. This equation only holds true if the screw and female thread materials are the same. If they are not the same, then the following equations can be used to determine the additional thread length that is required:&lt;ref name="threadengagement"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;J = \frac{\text{tensile strength of external thread material}}{\text{tensile strength of internal thread material}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L_{e2} = J \times L_e&lt;/math&gt;

Where L&lt;sub&gt;e2&lt;/sub&gt; is the new required thread engagement.

While these formulas give absolute minimum thread engagement, many industries specify that bolted connections be at least fully engaged. For instance, the [[FAA]] has determined that in general cases, at least one thread must be protruding from any bolted connection.

== Failure modes ==
The most common mode of [[structural failure|failure]] is overloading: Operating forces of the application produce loads that exceed the clamp load, causing the joint to loosen over time or fail catastrophically.

Overtorquing might cause failure by damaging the threads and deforming the fastener, though this can happen over a very long time. Undertorquing can cause failures by allowing a joint to come loose, and it may also allow the joint to flex and thus fail under fatigue.

[[Brinelling]] may occur with poor quality washers, leading to a loss of clamp load and subsequent failure of the joint.

Other modes of failure include [[corrosion]], [[embedment]], and exceeding the [[shear stress]] limit.

Bolted joints may be used intentionally as [[sacrificial part]]s, which are intended to fail before other parts, as in a [[shear pin]].

== Locking mechanisms ==
[[Image:Car hub cotter pin.jpg|thumb|right|Bolted joints in an automobile wheel. Here the outer fasteners are four studs with three of the four nuts that secure the wheel. The central nut (with locking cover and [[Split pin|cotter pin]]) secures the wheel bearing to the spindle.]]

Locking mechanisms keep bolted joints from coming loose. They are required when [[vibration]] or joint movement will cause loss of [[clamp (tool)|clamp]] [[Structural load|load]] and joint failure, and in equipment where the [[security]] of bolted joints is essential. A prevalent test for the self-loosening behaviour is the [[Junker test]].
* Jam Nuts – Two nuts, tightened on each other.  In this application a thinner nut should be placed adjacent to the joint, and a thicker nut tightened onto it.  The thicker nut applies more force to the joint, first relieving the force on the threads of the thinner nut and then applying a force in the opposite direction.  In this way the thicker nut presses tightly on the side of the threads away from the joint, while the thinner nut presses on the side of the threads nearest the joint, tightly locking the two nuts against the threads in both directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boltscience.com/pages/twonuts.htm|title=The use of two nuts to prevent self loosening|publisher=boltscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Friction-locking of threads – An insert on the internal threads (either metallic or non-metallic, e.g. [[Nyloc nut]]) or a plug/patch of non-metallic material on the external threads is installed. This material binds against the threads of the opposing fastener with a friction force and creates a prevailing torque, which resists the backing-out or loosening of the fastener.&lt;ref name="boltscience.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boltscience.com/pages/vibloose.htm|title=Vibration Loosening Of Bolts and Threaded Fasteners|publisher=boltscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Chemical locking compounds – The use of a chemical locking compound binds the threads together when the compound cures. Examples of such a compound includes [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] compounds such as [[Loctite]], which cures in the absence of oxygen and acts as an adhesive to lock the threads of the joint together.&lt;ref name="boltscience.com"/&gt;

==Bolt banging==
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}

''Bolt banging'' occurs in buildings when bolted joints slip into "bearing under load", thus causing a loud and potentially frightening noise resembling a rifle shot that is not, however, of structural significance and does not pose any threat to occupants.  

A bolted joint between two elements may act as a bearing-type joint, or a friction joint.  In the friction joint, the elements are clamped together with enough force that the resultant friction between the clamped surfaces prevents them from slipping laterally over each other.

In the bearing joint, the bolt itself limits lateral movement of the elements by the shank of the bolt bearing upon the sides of the holes in the clamped elements.  Such joints require less clamping force, because a high level of friction between the clamped surfaces is not required. The clearance between the bolt and the holes means that some lateral movement may occur before the bolt bears against the sides of the holes. 

Even when designed as a bearing joint, the surface friction between the clamped elements may be sufficient to resist movement for some time, especially when the building may not yet be fully loaded – thus it operates initially as a friction joint.  When the lateral force becomes sufficient to overcome this friction, the clamped elements move until the sides of the holes bear against the shank of the bolt.  This movement – "slip into bearing" – usually starts and stops very suddenly, often releasing elastic energy in the associated elements, resulting in a loud but harmless bang.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, C.J.: "Steel Interchange: Banging Bolts", ''[http://msc.aisc.org/globalassets/modern-steel/archives/1999/07/1999v07_interchange.pdf MSC: Modern Steel Construction]'', July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Butser Ancient Farm''' is an [[archaeological open-air museum]] located near [[Petersfield, Hampshire|Petersfield]] in [[Hampshire]], southern [[England]]. Butser features experimental reconstructions of prehistoric, Romano-British and Anglo-Saxon buildings. Examples of Neolithic dwellings,  [[Iron Age]] [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]], a Romano-British villa and an early Saxon house are on display. The site is used as both a tourist attraction and a site for the undertaking of [[experimental archaeology]]. In this latter capacity, it was designed so that archaeologists could learn more about the agricultural and domestic economy in Britain during the millennium that lasted from circa 400 [[BCE]] to 400 CE, in what was the Late [[British Iron Age]] and [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] periods.&lt;ref name=Reynolds1999&gt;[[#Rey99|Reynolds 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1970 by the [[Council for British Archaeology]], in 1972 they recruited experimental archaeologist [[Peter J. Reynolds]] to run the site as project director. It was initially located on the site of a Bronze and Iron Age farmstead on [[Butser Hill]], but in 1989 relocated to Hillscombe Down, and in 1991 to Bascombe Copse on the slopes of [[Windmill Hill, Hampshire|Windmill Hill]].

The farm is open to the public and runs various events throughout the year. Archaeologist [[Mick Aston]] commented that "Virtually all the reconstruction drawings of Iron Age settlements now to be seen in books are based" on the work at Butser Farm, and that it "revolutionised the way in which the pre-Roman Iron Age economy was perceived".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ast01|Aston 2001]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Butser Ancient Farm was founded in 1970 by the [[Council for British Archaeology]] and in 1972 they recruited [[experimental archaeology|experimental archaeologist]] [[Peter J. Reynolds]] (1939–2001) as director.&lt;ref name=Reynolds1979&gt;[[#Rey79|Reynolds 1979]]. pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The farm was named after its original site at Little Butser, a northerly spur of [[Butser Hill]], a few kilometres from [[Petersfield]] in Hampshire. In the original Bronze and Iron Ages, a farmstead had been found on Little Butser, whose occupants had farmed the valley to the north and east.&lt;ref name=Reynolds1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reynolds1979/&gt; 

In 1976 a second site, known as the Ancient Farm Demonstration Area (AFDA), was opened at [[Hillscombe Down]] on the southern slopes of Butser Hill, about a kilometre away from the main Farm. This was primarily designed to be a public site which could act as an educational resource for schoolchildren, and it was intended that this would take away the visitor pressure from the original site, where the large numbers of visitors (at times over a thousand people turned up to open days) were getting in the way of the experimental archaeology.&lt;ref name=Reynolds1999/&gt; The first Butser Farm site at Little Butser was subsequently closed down in 1989.&lt;ref name=Reynolds1999/&gt; 

In 1991 the project moved to Bascomb Copse on the slopes of [[Windmill Hill, Hampshire]] between [[Chalton, Hampshire]] and [[Clanfield, Hampshire]], about 5&amp;nbsp;km from the original site.

Buildings at the farm include simulated pre-Roman [[roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouse]]s and a simulated [[Roman villa]].  The 'Longbridge Deverell House' was the first full-sized roundhouse to be built at the latest site, and at the time one of the largest in Europe.{{fact|date=July 2012}}

After Peter's death in 2001, the site was run by his partner, Christine Shaw, for a number of years. Under her guidance, one of Peter's projects, a Roman building, was completed, resulting in the first full scale construction simulation of the wing of a Romano-British villa from Sparsholt, near Winchester. It was financed with the support of the [[Discovery Channel]], and was filmed for a ten-part series for television.{{fact|date=July 2012}}

In 2006/7, a management team was assembled, and with Christine's guidance, took over the running of the Butser Project. The management team consists of Simon Jay and Maureen Page, running the farm under the business "Butser Education CIC". {{fact|date=July 2012}}

It was also in 2006 that the 'Longbridge Deverell House' started to collapse, and prompted a programme of redevelopment of the constructions across the farm. A major re-assessment of the techniques of building was undertaken. It was decided to use the opportunity to examine the accumulated information of a further 20 years of excavation evidence.{{fact|date=July 2012}}

Following the dismantling of the 'Longbridge Deverell House', the replacement is based on the excavations of the 'Little Woodbury House'. Under the leadership of David Freeman, construction started in February 2007 and finished in December, having gone through one of the wettest summers on record.{{fact|date=July 2012}}

A simple version of the CRISPR/Cas system, CRISPR/Cas9, has been modified to edit genomes. By delivering the [[Cas9]] nuclease complexed with a synthetic [[guide RNA]] (gRNA) into a cell, the cell's [[genome]] can be cut at a desired location, allowing existing genes to be removed and/or new ones added.&lt;ref name="nature99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vb99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26121415"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hendel A, Bak RO, Clark JT, Kennedy AB, Ryan DE, Roy S, Steinfeld I, Lunstad BD, Kaiser RJ, Wilkens AB, Bacchetta R, Tsalenko A, Dellinger D, Bruhn L, Porteus MH | title = Chemically modified guide RNAs enhance CRISPR-Cas genome editing in human primary cells | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 33 | issue = 9 | pages = 985–9 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26121415 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.3290 | pmc=4729442}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cas9-gRNA complex corresponds with the CAS III CRISPR-RNA complex in the accompanying diagram.

== History ==
=== Repeated sequences ===
The discovery of clustered DNA repeats occurred independently in three parts of the world. The first description of what would later be called CRISPR is from [[Osaka University]] researcher [[Yoshizumi Ishino]] and his colleagues in 1987. They accidentally cloned part of a CRISPR together with the ''[[Inhibitor of apoptosis|iap]]'' gene, the target of interest. The organization of the repeats was unusual because repeated sequences are typically arranged consecutively along DNA.&lt;ref name="Ishino1987"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishino Y, Shinagawa H, Makino K, Amemura M, Nakata A | title = Nucleotide sequence of the iap gene, responsible for alkaline phosphatase isozyme conversion in Escherichia coli, and identification of the gene product | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 169 | issue = 12 | pages = 5429–33 | date = December 1987 | pmid = 3316184 | pmc = 213968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hsu2014" /&gt; They studied the relation of "iap" to the bacterium ''[[E. coli]]''. The function of the interrupted clustered repeats was not known at the time.

In 1993, researchers of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' in the Netherlands published two articles about a cluster of interrupted direct repeats (DR) in this bacterium. These researchers recognized the diversity of the DR-intervening sequences among different strains of ''M. tuberculosis''&lt;ref name="Soolingen1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Soolingen D, de Haas PE, Hermans PW, Groenen PM, van Embden JD | title = Comparison of various repetitive DNA elements as genetic markers for strain differentiation and epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 31 | issue = 8 | pages = 1987–95 | date = August 1993 | pmid = 7690367 | pmc = 265684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and used this property to design a typing method that was named ''spoligotyping'', which is still in use today.&lt;ref name="Groenen1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Groenen PM, Bunschoten AE, van Soolingen D, van Embden JD | title = Nature of DNA polymorphism in the direct repeat cluster of Mycobacterium tuberculosis; application for strain differentiation by a novel typing method | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 1057–65 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 7934856 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1993.tb00976.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mojica2016&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mojica FJ, Montoliu L |title=On the Origin of CRISPR-Cas Technology: From Prokaryotes to Mammals |journal=Trends in Microbiology |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=811–20 |year=2016 |pmid=27401123 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2016.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, repeats were observed in the archaeal organisms of ''[[Haloferax]]'' and ''[[Haloarcula]]'' species, and their function was studied by [[Francisco Mojica]] at the [[University of Alicante]] in Spain. Although his hypothesis turned out to be wrong, Mojica's supervisor surmised at the time that the clustered repeats had a role in correctly segregating replicated DNA into daughter cells during cell division because plasmids and chromosomes with identical repeat arrays could not coexist in ''[[Haloferax volcanii]]''. Transcription of the interrupted repeats was also noted for the first time.&lt;ref name=Mojica2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mojica2016b&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Rodriguez-Valera F |title=The discovery of CRISPR in archaea and bacteria |journal=The FEBS Journal |volume=283 |issue=17 |pages=3162–9 |year=2016 |pmid=27234458 |doi=10.1111/febs.13766 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, Mojica performed a survey of scientific literature and one of his students performed a search in published genomes with a program devised by himself.

=== CRISPR-associated systems ===
A major addition to the understanding of CRISPR came with Jansen's observation that the prokaryote repeat cluster was accompanied by a set of homologous genes that make up CRISPR-associated systems or ''cas'' genes. Four ''cas'' genes (''cas'' 1 - 4) were initially recognized. The Cas proteins showed [[helicase]] and [[nuclease]] motifs, suggesting a role in the dynamic structure of the CRISPR loci.&lt;ref name="pmid11952905"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jansen R, Embden JD, Gaastra W, Schouls LM | title = Identification of genes that are associated with DNA repeats in prokaryotes | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 1565–75 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11952905 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02839.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this publication the acronym CRISPR was coined as the universal name of this pattern. However, the CRISPR function remained enigmatic.

[[File:SimpleCRISPR.jpg|thumb|Simplified diagram of a CRISPR locus. The three major components of a CRISPR locus are shown: ''cas'' genes, a leader sequence, and a repeat-spacer array.

In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from [[phage]] DNA and [[extrachromosomal DNA]] such as [[plasmids]].&lt;ref name="pmid15758212"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pourcel C, Salvignol G, Vergnaud G | title = CRISPR elements in Yersinia pestis acquire new repeats by preferential uptake of bacteriophage DNA, and provide additional tools for evolutionary studies | journal = Microbiology | volume = 151 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 653–63 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15758212 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.27437-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15791728"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Díez-Villaseñor C, García-Martínez J, Soria E | title = Intervening sequences of regularly spaced prokaryotic repeats derive from foreign genetic elements | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 174–82 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15791728 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00239-004-0046-3 | bibcode = 2005JMolE..60..174M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16079334"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolotin A, Quinquis B, Sorokin A, Ehrlich SD | title = Clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPRs) have spacers of extrachromosomal origin | journal = Microbiology | volume = 151 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 2551–61 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16079334 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.28048-0 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/''cas'' system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid20056882" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25963251"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morange M | title = What history tells us XXXVII.

The first publication&lt;ref name="pmid15791728" /&gt; proposing a role of CRISPR-Cas in microbial immunity, by the researchers at the [[University of Alicante]], predicted a role for the RNA transcript of spacers on target recognition in a mechanism that could be analogous to the [[RNA interference]] system used by eukaryotic cells. Koonin and colleagues extended this RNA interference hypothesis by proposing mechanisms of action for the different CRISPR-Cas subtypes according to the predicted function of their proteins.&lt;ref name=Makarova2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Makarova KS, Grishin NV, Shabalina SA, Wolf YI, Koonin EV | title = A putative RNA-interference-based immune system in prokaryotes: computational analysis of the predicted enzymatic machinery, functional analogies with eukaryotic RNAi, and hypothetical mechanisms of action | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 1 | issue =  | pages = 7 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16545108 | pmc = 1462988 | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-1-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental work by several groups revealed the basic mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas immunity. In 2007, the first experimental evidence that CRISPR was an adaptive immune system was published.&lt;ref name=Hsu2014/&gt; A CRISPR region in ''[[Streptococcus thermophilus]]'' acquired spacers from the DNA of an infecting bacteriophage. The researchers manipulated the resistance of ''S. thermophilus'' to phage by adding and deleting spacers whose sequence matched those found in the tested phages.&lt;ref name=Marraffini2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="craze"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pennisi E | title = The CRISPR craze | journal = Science | volume = 341 | issue = 6148 | pages = 833–6 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23970676 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.341.6148.833 | department = News Focus }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Brouns and Van der Oost identified a complex of Cas proteins (called Cascade) that in ''E. coli'' cut the CRISPR RNA precursor within the repeats into mature spacer-containing RNA molecules (crRNA), which remained bound to the protein complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brouns SJ, Jore MM, Lundgren M, Westra ER, Slijkhuis RJ, Snijders AP, Dickman MJ, Makarova KS, Koonin EV, van der Oost J | title = Small CRISPR RNAs guide antiviral defense in prokaryotes | journal = Science | volume = 321 | issue = 5891 | pages = 960–4 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18703739 | pmc = 5898235 | doi = 10.1126/science.1159689 | bibcode = 2008Sci...321..960B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it was found that Cascade, crRNA and a helicase/nuclease (Cas3) were required to provide a bacterial host with immunity against infection by a DNA virus. By designing an anti-virus CRISPR, they demonstrated that two orientations of the crRNA (sense/antisense) provided immunity, indicating that the crRNA guides were targeting dsDNA. That year Marraffini and Sontheimer indeed confirmed that a CRISPR sequence of ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis|S. epidermidis]]'' targeted DNA and not RNA to prevent [[conjugation (genetics)|conjugation]]. This finding was at odds with the proposed RNA-interference-like mechanism of CRISPR-Cas immunity, although a CRISPR-Cas system that targets foreign RNA was later found in ''[[Pyrococcus furiosus]]''.&lt;ref name=Hsu2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marraffini2015/&gt; A 2010 study showed that CRISPR-Cas cuts both strands of phage and plasmid DNA in ''S. thermophilus''.&lt;ref name=Garneau2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garneau JE, Dupuis MÈ, Villion M, Romero DA, Barrangou R, Boyaval P, Fremaux C, Horvath P, Magadán AH, Moineau S | display-authors = 6 | title = The CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system cleaves bacteriophage and plasmid DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue = 7320 | pages = 67–71 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21048762 | doi = 10.1038/nature09523 | bibcode = 2010Natur.468...67G | citeseerx = 10.1.1.451.9645 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cas9 ===
Researchers studied a simpler CRISPR system from ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' that relies on the protein [[Cas9]]. The Cas9 endonuclease is a four-component system that includes two small RNA molecules named CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA).&lt;ref name="Barrangou2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R | title = Diversity of CRISPR-Cas immune systems and molecular machines | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 16 | issue =  | pages = 247 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26549499 | pmc = 4638107 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-015-0816-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Doudna]] and [[Emmanuelle Charpentier]] re-engineered the Cas9 endonuclease into a more manageable two-component system by fusing the two RNA molecules into a "single-guide RNA" that, when combined with Cas9, could find and cut the DNA target specified by the guide RNA. By manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the guide RNA, the artificial Cas9 system could be programmed to target any DNA sequence for cleavage.&lt;ref name="pmid22745249" /&gt; Another group of collaborators comprising [[Virginijus Šikšnys]] together with Gasiūnas, Barrangou and Horvath showed that Cas9 from the ''S. thermophilus'' CRISPR system can also be reprogrammed to target a site of their choosing by changing the sequence of its crRNA. These advances fueled efforts to edit genomes with the modified CRISPR-Cas9 system.&lt;ref name="Mojica2016"/&gt;

The CRISPR/Cas9 system has shown to make effective gene edits in Human [[tripronuclear zygotes]] first described in a 2015 paper by Chinese scientists P. Liang and Y. Xu. The system made a successful cleavage of mutant [[HBB|Beta-Hemoglobin]] (HBB) in 28 out of 54 embryos. 4 out of the 28 embryos were successfully recombined using a donor template given by the scientists. The scientists showed that during DNA recombination of the cleaved strand, the homologous endogenous sequence HBD competes with the exogenous donor template. DNA repair in human embryos is much more complicated and particular than in derived stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liang P, Xu Y, Zhang X, Ding C, Huang R, Zhang Z, Lv J, Xie X, Chen Y, Li Y, Sun Y, Bai Y, Songyang Z, Ma W, Zhou C, Huang J | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes | journal = Protein &amp; Cell | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 363–372 | date = May 2015 | doi = 10.1007/s13238-015-0153-5 | pmid=25894090 | pmc=4417674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cpf1 ===
In 2015, the nuclease Cpf1 was characterized in the [[CRISPR/Cpf1]] system of the bacterium ''[[Francisella novicida]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid26422227"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zetsche B, Gootenberg JS, Abudayyeh OO, Slaymaker IM, Makarova KS, Essletzbichler P, Volz SE, Joung J, van der Oost J, Regev A, Koonin EV, Zhang F | display-authors = 6 | title = Cpf1 is a single RNA-guided endonuclease of a class 2 CRISPR-Cas system | journal = Cell | volume = 163 | issue = 3 | pages = 759–71 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26422227 | pmc = 4638220 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.09.038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27096362"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fonfara I, Richter H, Bratovič M, Le Rhun A, Charpentier E | title = The CRISPR-associated DNA-cleaving enzyme Cpf1 also processes precursor CRISPR RNA | journal = Nature | volume = 532 | issue = 7600 | pages = 517–21 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27096362 | doi = 10.1038/nature17945 | bibcode = 2016Natur.532..517F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name, from a [[TIGRFAMs]] [[protein family]] definition built in 2012, reflects the prevalence of its CRISPR-Cas subtype in the Prevotella and Francisella lineages. Cpf1 showed several key differences from Cas9 including: causing a 'staggered' cut in double stranded DNA as opposed to the 'blunt' cut produced by Cas9, relying on a 'T rich' PAM (providing alternative targeting sites to Cas9) and requiring only a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) for successful targeting. By contrast Cas9 requires both crRNA and a [[Trans-activating crRNA|transactivating crRNA]] (tracrRNA).

These differences may give Cpf1 some advantages over Cas9. For example, Cpf1's small crRNAs are ideal for multiplexed genome editing, as more of them can be packaged in one vector than can Cas9's sgRNAs. As well, the sticky 5' overhangs left by Cpf1 can be used for DNA assembly that is much more target-specific than traditional Restriction Enzyme cloning.&lt;ref name="PMC5316869"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim H, Kim ST, Ryu J, Kang BC, Kim JS, and Kim SG | title = CRISPR/Cpf1-mediated DNA-free plant genome editing | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 8 | issue = 14406 | pages = 14406 | date = February 2017 | pmc = 5316869 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms14406 | pmid=28205546| bibcode = 2017NatCo...814406K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Cpf1 cleaves DNA 18-23 base pairs downstream from the PAM site. This means there is no disruption to the recognition sequence after repair, and so Cpf1 enables multiple rounds of DNA cleavage. By contrast, since Cas9 cuts only 3 base pairs upstream of the PAM site, the NHEJ pathway results in indel mutations which destroy the recognition sequence, thereby preventing further rounds of cutting. In theory, repeated rounds of DNA cleavage should cause an increased opportunity for the desired genomic editing to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Cpf1 Nuclease|url = https://www.abmgood.com/marketing/knowledge_base/CRISPR_Cas9_Introduction_Part7.php#ATSPC|website = abmgood.com|accessdate = 2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cas genes and CRISPR subtypes ===

Small clusters of ''cas'' genes are often located next to CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Collectively the 93 ''cas'' genes are grouped into 35 families based on sequence similarity of the encoded proteins. 11 of the 35 families form the ''cas'' core, which includes the protein families Cas1 through Cas9. A complete CRISPR-Cas locus has at least one gene belonging to the ''cas'' core.&lt;ref name="Makarova2015" /&gt;

CRISPR-Cas systems fall into two classes. Class 1 systems use a complex of multiple Cas proteins to degrade foreign nucleic acids. Class 2 systems use a single large Cas protein for the same purpose. Class 1 is divided into types I, III, and IV; class 2 is divided into types II, V, and VI.&lt;ref name="Wright2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright AV, Nuñez JK, Doudna JA | title = Biology and Applications of CRISPR Systems: Harnessing Nature's Toolbox for Genome Engineering | journal = Cell | volume = 164 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 29–44 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26771484 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 6 system types are divided into 19 subtypes.&lt;ref name="Westra2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Westra | first1 = Edze R. | last2 = Dowling | first2 = Andrea J. | last3 = Broniewski | first 3 = Jenny M. | last4 = van Houte | first4 = Stineke | name-list-format = vanc | title = Evolution and Ecology of CRISPR | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | date = November 2016 | volume = 47 | issue = 1 |pages = 307–331 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-121415-032428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each type and most subtypes are characterized by a "signature gene" found almost exclusively in the category.

[[File:The Stages of CRISPR immunity.svg|thumb|left|upright=2|The stages of CRISPR immunity for each of the three major types of adaptive immunity. (1) Acquisition begins by recognition of invading DNA by [[Cas1]] and Cas2 and cleavage of a protospacer. (2) The protospacer is ligated to the direct repeat adjacent to the leader sequence and (3) single strand extension repairs the CRISPR and duplicates the direct repeat. The crRNA processing and interference stages occur differently in each of the three major CRISPR systems. (4) The primary CRISPR transcript is cleaved by cas genes to produce crRNAs. (5) In type I systems Cas6e/Cas6f cleave at the junction of ssRNA and dsRNA formed by hairpin loops in the direct repeat. Type II systems use a trans-activating (tracr) RNA to form dsRNA, which is cleaved by [[Cas9]] and RNaseIII. Type III systems use a Cas6 homolog that does not require hairpin loops in the direct repeat for cleavage. (6) In type II and type III systems secondary trimming is performed at either the 5’ or 3’ end to produce mature crRNAs. (7) Mature crRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form interference complexes. (8) In type I and type II systems, interactions between the protein and PAM sequence are required for degradation of invading DNA. Type III systems do not require a PAM for successful degradation and in type III-A systems basepairing occurs between the crRNA and mRNA rather than the DNA, targeted by type III-B systems.]]

CRISPR-Cas immunity is a natural process of bacteria and archaea. CRISPR-Cas prevents bacteriophage infection, [[conjugation (genetics)|conjugation]] and [[transformation (genetics)#Natural transformation|natural transformation]] by degrading foreign nucleic acids that enter the cell.&lt;ref name="Marraffini2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marraffini LA | title = CRISPR-Cas immunity in prokaryotes | journal = Nature | volume = 526 | issue = 7571 | pages = 55–61 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26432244 | doi = 10.1038/nature15386 | bibcode = 2015Natur.526...55M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spacer acquisition ===
When a [[microbe]] is invaded by a [[virus]], the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. [[Cas1]] and Cas2 are found in both types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of [[cas1]] or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.&lt;ref name="pmid19120484"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aliyari R, Ding SW | title = RNA-based viral immunity initiated by the Dicer family of host immune receptors | journal = Immunological Reviews | volume = 227 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–88 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19120484 | pmc = 2676720 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00722.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23696746"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dugar G, Herbig A, Förstner KU, Heidrich N, Reinhardt R, Nieselt K, Sharma CM | title = High-resolution transcriptome maps reveal strain-specific regulatory features of multiple Campylobacter jejuni isolates | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = e1003495 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23696746 | pmc = 3656092 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003495 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22160698"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hatoum-Aslan A, Maniv I, Marraffini LA | title = Mature clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats RNA (crRNA) length is measured by a ruler mechanism anchored at the precursor processing site | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 52 | pages = 21218–22 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22160698 | pmc = 3248500 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1112832108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10821218H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22402487"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yosef I, Goren MG, Qimron U | title = Proteins and DNA elements essential for the CRISPR adaptation process in Escherichia coli | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | pages = 5569–76 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22402487 | pmc = 3384332 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22558257"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swarts DC, Mosterd C, van Passel MW, Brouns SJ | title = CRISPR interference directs strand specific spacer acquisition | journal = PLOS One | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e35888 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22558257 | pmc = 3338789 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035888 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...735888S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nt of the protospacer.

However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.&lt;ref name="pmid23403393" /&gt; It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.

==== Insertion variants ====
Analysis of ''[[Sulfolobus solfataricus]]'' CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion, as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid22834906" /&gt;

Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was discovered in the type I-E system of ''E. coli''. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This ‘priming’ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the priming spacer.&lt;ref name="pmid22558257" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22771574" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22781758" /&gt; This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.&lt;ref name="pmid22781758" /&gt;

=== Biogenesis ===
CRISPR-RNA (crRNA), which later guides the Cas nuclease to the target during the interference step, must be generated from the CRISPR sequence. The crRNA is initially transcribed as part of a single long transcript encompassing much of the CRISPR array.&lt;ref name="pmid20125085" /&gt; This transcript is then cleaved by Cas proteins to form crRNAs.

Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a [[trans-activating crRNA]] (tracrRNA).&lt;ref name="pmid23696746" /&gt; Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer, which is instead truncated at one end.&lt;ref name="pmid22949671" /&gt;

CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.&lt;ref name="pmid19095942" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Garneau2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19120484" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22558257" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21646539"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Semenova E, Jore MM, Datsenko KA, Semenova A, Westra ER, Wanner B, van der Oost J, Brouns SJ, Severinov K | display-authors = 6 | title = Interference by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) RNA is governed by a seed sequence | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 25 | pages = 10098–103 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21646539 | pmc = 3121866 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1104144108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10810098S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21166892"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gudbergsdottir S, Deng L, Chen Z, Jensen JV, Jensen LR, She Q, Garrett RA | title = Dynamic properties of the Sulfolobus CRISPR/Cas and CRISPR/Cmr systems when challenged with vector-borne viral and plasmid genes and protospacers | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–49 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21166892 | pmc = 3025118 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07452.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21385233"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manica A, Zebec Z, Teichmann D, Schleper C | title = In vivo activity of CRISPR-mediated virus defence in a hyperthermophilic archaeon | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 481–91 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21385233 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07586.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins bound to a single crRNA.&lt;ref name="pmid21460843"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jore MM, Lundgren M, van Duijn E, Bultema JB, Westra ER, Waghmare SP, Wiedenheft B, Pul U, Wurm R, Wagner R, Beijer MR, Barendregt A, Zhou K, Snijders AP, Dickman MJ, Doudna JA, Boekema EJ, Heck AJ, van der Oost J, Brouns SJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Structural basis for CRISPR RNA-guided DNA recognition by Cascade | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 529–36 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21460843 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21938068"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiedenheft B, Lander GC, Zhou K, Jore MM, Brouns SJ, van der Oost J, Doudna JA, Nogales E | title = Structures of the RNA-guided surveillance complex from a bacterial immune system | journal = Nature | volume = 477 | issue = 7365 | pages = 486–9 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21938068 | doi = 10.1038/nature10402 | bibcode = 2011Natur.477..486W | pmc=4165517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interference ===
During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.

Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, [[Cas9]], for the interference step.&lt;ref name="pmid22949671" /&gt; [[Cas9]] requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is required in type II systems. However, the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).

Type III systems, like type I require six or seven Cas proteins binding to crRNAs.&lt;ref name="pmid22227115"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang J, Rouillon C, Kerou M, Reeks J, Brugger K, Graham S, Reimann J, Cannone G, Liu H, Albers SV, Naismith JH, Spagnolo L, White MF | title = Structure and mechanism of the CMR complex for CRISPR-mediated antiviral immunity | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–13 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22227115 | pmc = 3381847 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2011.12.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19945378"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hale CR, Zhao P, Olson S, Duff MO, Graveley BR, Wells L, Terns RM, Terns MP | title = RNA-guided RNA cleavage by a CRISPR RNA-Cas protein complex | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 5 | pages = 945–56 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19945378 | pmc = 2951265 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type III systems analysed from ''S. solfataricus'' and ''P. furiosus'' both target the mRNA of phages rather than phage DNA genome,&lt;ref name="pmid23320564" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19945378" /&gt; which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.&lt;ref name="pmid22337052" /&gt;

The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.&lt;ref name="pmid20072129"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marraffini LA, Sontheimer EJ | title = Self versus non-self discrimination during CRISPR RNA-directed immunity | journal = Nature | volume = 463 | issue = 7280 | pages = 568–71 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20072129 | pmc = 2813891 | doi = 10.1038/nature08703 | bibcode = 2010Natur.463..568M }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as [[Restriction enzyme#Type V|type V restriction enzymes]].

The cas genes in the adaptor and effector modules of the CRISPR-Cas system are believed to have evolved from two different ancestral modules.

CRISPR/Cas can immunize bacteria against certain phages and thus halt transmission.

Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss A | title = Lamarckian Illusions | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 30 | issue = 10 | pages = 566–568 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26411613 | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2015.08.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As more recent studies have been conducted, it has become apparent that the acquired spacer regions of CRISPR-Cas systems are a from of Lamarckian evolution because they are genetic mutations that are acquired and then passed on.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Wolf YI | title = Just how Lamarckian is CRISPR-Cas immunity: the continuum of evolvability mechanisms | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 9 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26912144 | pmc = 4765028 | doi = 10.1186/s13062-016-0111-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the evolution of the car gene machinery that facilitates the system evolves through classic Darwinian evolution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Coevolution ===
Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed [[coevolution]] of host and viral genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidelberg JF, Nelson WC, Schoenfeld T, Bhaya D | title = Germ warfare in a microbial mat community: CRISPRs provide insights into the co-evolution of host and viral genomes | journal = PLOS One | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = e4169 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19132092 | pmc = 2612747 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004169 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4169H | editor1-last = Ahmed | editor1-first = Niyaz }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in [[pathogen]]ic and [[commensal]] bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, ''[[Francisella novicida]]'' uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial [[lipoprotein]] that is critical for ''F. novicida'' to dampen host response and promote virulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sampson TR, Saroj SD, Llewellyn AC, Tzeng YL, Weiss DS | title = A CRISPR/Cas system mediates bacterial innate immune evasion and virulence | journal = Nature | volume = 497 | issue = 7448 | pages = 254–7 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23584588 | pmc = 3651764 | doi = 10.1038/nature12048 | bibcode = 2013Natur.497..254S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic model of CRISPR evolution is newly incorporated spacers driving phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacterial immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.&lt;ref name="pmid20072129" /&gt; Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain remains phage sensitive.&lt;ref name="pmid18065545" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20072129" /&gt;

=== Rates ===
A study of 124 ''S. thermophilus'' strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of spacer acquisition.&lt;ref name="pmid18065539" /&gt; Some CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A [[Comparative genomics|comparative genomic]] analysis showed that ''E. coli'' and ''S. enterica'' evolve much more slowly than ''S. thermophilus''. The latter's strains that diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.&lt;ref name="pmid20559554"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Touchon M, Rocha EP | title = The small, slow and specialized CRISPR and anti-CRISPR of Escherichia and Salmonella | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = e11126 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20559554 | pmc = 2886076 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0011126 | editor1-last = Randau | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...511126T | editor1-first = Lennart }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[metagenomics|Metagenomic]] analysis of two acid mine drainage [[biofilm]]s showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions versus the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community than the other.&lt;ref name="pmid17894817" /&gt; In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% were shared across individuals.&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt;

From the same environment a single strain was tracked using [[PCR]] primers specific to its CRISPR system. Broad-level results of spacer presence/absence showed significant diversity. However, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt; suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly.

CRISPRs were analysed from the metagenomes produced for the [[human microbiome project]].&lt;ref name="pmid22719260"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rho M, Wu YW, Tang H, Doak TG, Ye Y | title = Diverse CRISPRs evolving in human microbiomes | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1002441 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22719260 | pmc = 3374615 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002441 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most were body-site specific, some within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these loci originated from [[streptococcal]] species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some showed little evolution over time.&lt;ref name="pmid22719260" /&gt;

CRISPR evolution was studied in [[chemostat]]s using ''S. thermophilus'' to directly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, ''S. thermophilus'' strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.&lt;ref name="pmid23057534"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun CL, Barrangou R, Thomas BC, Horvath P, Fremaux C, Banfield JF | title = Phage mutations in response to CRISPR diversification in a bacterial population | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 463–70 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23057534 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02879.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same interval the phage developed [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that became fixed in the population, suggesting that targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid23057534" /&gt;

Another ''S. thermophilus'' experiment showed that phages can infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer. Yet another showed that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.&lt;ref name="pmid24586036"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuno S, Sako Y, Yoshida T | title = Diversification of CRISPR within coexisting genotypes in a natural population of the bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa | journal = Microbiology | volume = 160 | issue = Pt 5 | pages = 903–16 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24586036 | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.073494-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.

== Identification ==

CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea&lt;ref name="pmid24728998" /&gt; and show some sequence similarities.&lt;ref name="pmid17442114" /&gt; Their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeats decreases the likelihood of a false positive match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sorek R, Kunin V, Hugenholtz P | title = CRISPR--a widespread system that provides acquired resistance against phages in bacteria and archaea | journal = Nature Reviews.

Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble, due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.&lt;ref name="pmid18065539" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22583485"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pride DT, Salzman J, Relman DA | title = Comparisons of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and viromes in human saliva reveal bacterial adaptations to salivary viruses | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 2564–76 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22583485 | pmc = 3424356 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02775.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23701169"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Held NL, Herrera A, Whitaker RJ | title = Reassortment of CRISPR repeat-spacer loci in Sulfolobus islandicus | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 3065–76 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23701169 | doi = 10.1111/1462-2920.12146 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20927396"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Held NL, Herrera A, Cadillo-Quiroz H, Whitaker RJ | title = CRISPR associated diversity within a population of Sulfolobus islandicus | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = e12988 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20927396 | pmc = 2946923 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0012988 | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...512988H }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) primers.

The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely ''de novo'' identification&lt;ref name="pmid23511966"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Skennerton CT, Imelfort M, Tyson GW | title = Crass: identification and reconstruction of CRISPR from unassembled metagenomic data | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 41 | issue = 10 | pages = e105 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23511966 | pmc = 3664793 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from [[contig]]s (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA)&lt;ref name="pmid22719260" /&gt; and direct repeat sequences from published genomes&lt;ref name="pmid22732228"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stern A, Mick E, Tirosh I, Sagy O, Sorek R | title = CRISPR targeting reveals a reservoir of common phages associated with the human gut microbiome | journal = Genome Research | volume = 22 | issue = 10 | pages = 1985–94 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22732228 | pmc = 3460193 | doi = 10.1101/gr.138297.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.

== Use by phages ==

Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having [[genomic island|chromosomal islands]]. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.&lt;ref name="pmid20634809"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Novick RP, Christie GE, Penadés JR | title = The phage-related chromosomal islands of Gram-positive bacteria | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 541–51 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20634809 | pmc = 3522866 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PICIs are induced, excised, replicated and finally packaged into small capsids by certain staphylococcal temperate phages. PICIs use several mechanisms to block phage reproduction. In first mechanism PICI-encoded Ppi differentially blocks phage maturation by binding or interacting specifically with phage TerS, hence blocks phage TerS/TerL complex  formation responsible for phage DNA packaging. In second mechanism PICI CpmAB redirect the phage capsid morphogenetic protein to make 95% of SaPI-sized capsid and pahage DNA can package only 1/3rd of their genome in these small capsid and hence become nonviable phage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|vauthors=Ram G, Chen J, Kumar K, Ross HF, Ubeda C, Damle PK, Lane KD, Penadés JR, Christie GE, Novick RP|date=October 2012|title=Staphylococcal pathogenicity island interference with helper phage reproduction is a paradigm of molecular parasitism|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|issue=40|pages=16300–5|doi=10.1073/pnas.1204615109|pmc=3479557|pmid=22991467|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third mechanism involves two proteins, PtiA and PtiB, that target the LtrC, which is responsible for the production of virion and lysis proteins.

One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' [[serogroup]] O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a ''V. cholera'' PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the I-F system found in ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.&lt;ref name="pmid23446421"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seed KD, Lazinski DW, Calderwood SB, Camilli A | title = A bacteriophage encodes its own CRISPR/Cas adaptive response to evade host innate immunity | journal = Nature | volume = 494 | issue = 7438 | pages = 489–91 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23446421 | pmc = 3587790 | doi = 10.1038/nature11927 | bibcode = 2013Natur.494..489S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predecessors ===

In the early 2000s, researchers developed [[zinc finger nuclease]]s (ZFNs), synthetic proteins whose [[DNA-binding domains]] enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific points. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called [[transcription activator-like effector nuclease]]s (TALENs) provided an easier way to target a double-stranded break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc finger nucleases and TALENs require the creation of a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because the process requires making only a short RNA sequence.&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Susan|date=11 February 2014|title=CRISPR and Other Genome Editing Tools Boost Medical Research and Gene Therapy's Reach|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/review/524451/genome-surgery|accessdate=2014-04-13|name-list-format=vanc|journal=[[MIT Technology Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas [[RNA interference|RNA interference (RNAi)]] does not fully suppress gene function, CRISPR, [[Zinc finger nuclease|ZFNs]] and [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALENs]] provide full irreversible [[gene knockout]].&lt;ref name="Heidenreich_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidenreich M, Zhang F | title = Applications of CRISPR-Cas systems in neuroscience | journal = Nature Reviews.

=== Genome engineering ===
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a [[CRISPR#Cas genes and CRISPR subtypes|Type II]] CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes [[Cas9]], crRNA, tracrRNA along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology directed repair (HDR).

CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a [[plasmid]] to [[Transfection|transfect]] the target cells.&lt;ref name="Ran_2013" /&gt; The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table. The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template is designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.

Multiple crRNAs and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://archive.org/details/LyJosephP201311PhDThesis |title=Discovering Genes Responsible for Kidney Diseases |last=Ly |first=Joseph |year=2013 |type=Ph.D. |publisher=University of Toronto |accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells.

==== Structure ====
CRISPR/Cas9 offers a high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. It depends on two factors for its specificity: the target sequence and the PAM. The target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.&lt;ref name="Ran_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ran FA, Hsu PD, Wright J, Agarwala V, Scott DA, Zhang F | title = Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 2281–308 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24157548 | pmc = 3969860 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2013.143 | hdl = 1721.1/102943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence to bond with base pairs on the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|synthesized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horvath P, Barrangou R | title = CRISPR/Cas, the immune system of bacteria and archaea | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5962 | pages = 167–70 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20056882 | doi = 10.1126/science.1179555 | bibcode = 2010Sci...327..167H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bialk P, Rivera-Torres N, Strouse B, Kmiec EB | title = Regulation of Gene Editing Activity Directed by Single-Stranded Oligonucleotides and CRISPR/Cas9 Systems | journal = PLOS One | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = e0129308 | date = 2015-06-08 | pmid = 26053390 | pmc = 4459703 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0129308 | bibcode = 2015PLoSO..1029308B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by Cas9. Cas9 cannot be easily modified to recognize a different PAM sequence. However this is not too limiting as it is a short sequence and nonspecific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).&lt;ref name="Ran_2013" /&gt;

Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with the help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and – depending on the Cas9 variant – creates a single or double strand break in the DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/11/12/crispr-cas9-gene-editing-check-three-times-cut-once/ |title=CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing: check three times, cut once | first = Robert | last = Sanders | name-list-format = vanc |date=12 November 2015 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226231842/http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/11/12/crispr-cas9-gene-editing-check-three-times-cut-once/ |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger [[homology directed repair]], which is less error prone than the non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.&lt;ref name="Ran_2013" /&gt; The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.

Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Optimized CRISPR Design|url = http://crispr.mit.edu/|website = crispr.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Delivery ====
{{See also|Transfection}}

Delivery of Cas9, sgRNA, and associated complexes into cells can occur via viral and non-viral systems.

Using "dead" versions of Cas9 ([[Cas9#Interference of transcription by dCas9|dCas9]]) eliminates CRISPR's DNA-cutting ability, while preserving its ability to target desirable sequences. Multiple groups added various regulatory factors to dCas9s, enabling them to turn almost any gene on or off or adjust its level of activity.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough"&gt;{{cite web | title = And Science's Breakthrough of the Year is …|url = http://news.sciencemag.org/scientific-community/2015/12/and-science-s-breakthrough-year|website = news.sciencemag.org|accessdate = 2015-12-21|date = December 17, 2015|last = Science News Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated, [[Epigenetics|epigenetically]] modifying the gene. This modification inhibits transcription. These precisely placed modifications may then be used to regulate the effects on gene expressions and DNA dynamics after the inhibition of certain genome sequences within DNA. Within the past few years, epigenetic marks in different human cells have been closely researched and certain patterns within the marks have been found to correlate with everything ranging from tumor growth to brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledford H | title = CRISPR: gene editing is just the beginning | journal = Nature | volume = 531 | issue = 7593 | pages = 156–9 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26961639 | doi = 10.1038/531156a | url = https://www.nature.com/news/crispr-gene-editing-is-just-the-beginning-1.19510 | bibcode = 2016Natur.531..156L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, CRISPR-mediated activation (CRISPRa) promotes gene transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dominguez AA, Lim WA, Qi LS | title = Beyond editing: repurposing CRISPR-Cas9 for precision genome regulation and interrogation | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–15 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26670017 | pmc = 4922510 | doi = 10.1038/nrm.2015.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level.&lt;ref name="pmid24336571"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shalem O, Sanjana NE, Hartenian E, Shi X, Scott DA, Mikkelsen TS, Heckl D, Ebert BL, Root DE, Doench JG, Zhang F | title = Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells | journal = Science | volume = 343 | issue = 6166 | pages = 84–7 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24336571 | pmc = 4089965 | doi = 10.1126/science.1247005 | bibcode = 2014Sci...343...84S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription. For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA sequences called [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] that immediately precede the target gene.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

Cas9 was used to carry synthetic [[transcription factor]]s that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different locations on the gene's promoter.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

=== RNA editing ===
In 2016, researchers demonstrated that CRISPR from an ordinary mouth bacterium could be used to edit [[RNA]]. The researchers searched databases containing hundreds of millions of genetic sequences for those that resembled Crispr genes. They considered the [[fusobacteria]] ''Leptotrichia shahii''. It had a group of genes that resembled CRISPR genes, but with important differences. When the researchers equipped other bacteria with these genes, which they called C2c2, they found that the organisms gained a novel defense.&lt;ref name="Zimmer_2016"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/04/science/rna-c2c2-gene-editing-dna-crispr.html | title = Scientists Find Form of Crispr Gene Editing With New Capabilities|last=Zimmer|first=Carl | name-list-format = vanc | date=2016-06-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many viruses encode their genetic information in RNA rather than DNA that they repurpose to make new viruses. [[HIV]] and [[poliovirus]] are such viruses. Bacteria with C2c2 make molecules that can dismember RNA, destroying the virus. Tailoring these genes opened any RNA molecule to editing.&lt;ref name="Zimmer_2016" /&gt;

CRISPR-Cas systems can also be employed for editing of [[MicroRNA|micro-RNA]] and [[Long non-coding RNA|long-noncoding RNA]] genes in plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Basak J, Nithin C | title = Targeting Non-Coding RNAs in Plants with the CRISPR-Cas Technology is a Challenge yet Worth Accepting | journal = Frontiers in Plant Science | volume = 6 | pages = 1001 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26635829 | pmc = 4652605 | doi = 10.3389/fpls.2015.01001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disease models ===

CRISPR simplifies creation of [[Genetically modified organism#Mammals|animals for research]] that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is [[Gene knockdown|knocked down]] or mutated. CRISPR may be used at the [[germline]] level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be targeted at non-germline cells.&lt;ref name="pmid25914022"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Erp PB, Bloomer G, Wilkinson R, Wiedenheft B | title = The history and market impact of CRISPR RNA-guided nucleases | journal = Current Opinion in Virology | volume = 12 | issue =  | pages = 85–90 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25914022 | doi = 10.1016/j.coviro.2015.03.011 | pmc = 4470805}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25819765"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maggio I, Gonçalves MA | title = Genome editing at the crossroads of delivery, specificity, and fidelity | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 280–91 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25819765 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.02.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25868999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rath D, Amlinger L, Rath A, Lundgren M | title = The CRISPR-Cas immune system: biology, mechanisms and applications | journal = Biochimie | volume = 117 | issue =  | pages = 119–28 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 25868999 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2015.03.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRISPR can be utilized to create human cellular models of disease.

CRISPR/Cas-based "RNA-guided nucleases" can be used to target [[virulence factors]], genes encoding [[antibiotic resistance]] and other medically relevant sequences of interest. This technology thus represents a novel form of antimicrobial therapy and a strategy by which to manipulate bacterial populations.&lt;ref name="Gomaaetal2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gomaa AA, Klumpe HE, Luo ML, Selle K, Barrangou R, Beisel CL| title = Programmable removal of bacterial strains by use of genome-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems | journal = MBio | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = e00928–13 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24473129 | pmc = 3903277 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.00928-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CitorikMimee2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Citorik RJ, Mimee M, Lu TK | title = Sequence-specific antimicrobials using efficiently delivered RNA-guided nucleases | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 11 | pages = 1141–5 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25240928 | pmc = 4237163 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.3011 | hdl = 1721.1/100834 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies suggested a correlation between the interfering of the CRISPR/Cas locus and acquisition of antibiotic resistance&lt;ref name="Gholizadeh2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gholizadeh P, Aghazadeh M, Asgharzadeh M, Kafil HS,| title = Suppressing the CRISPR/Cas adaptive immune system in bacterial infections | journal = European Journal of Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases | volume = 36 | issue = 11 | pages = 2043–2051 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28601970  | doi = 10.1007/s10096-017-3036-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system provides protection of bacteria against invading foreign DNA, such as transposons, bacteriophages and plasmids.

Research suggests that CRISPR is an effective way to limit replication of multiple [[herpesviruses]]. It was able to eradicate viral DNA in the case of [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV). Anti-herpesvirus CRISPRs have promising applications such as removing cancer-causing EBV from tumor cells, helping rid donated organs for [[immunocompromised]] patients of viral invaders, or preventing [[Herpes labialis|cold sore]] outbreaks and recurrent eye infections by blocking [[HSV-1]] reactivation. {{as of|2016|August}}, these were awaiting testing.&lt;ref name="pmid27362483"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Diemen FR, Kruse EM, Hooykaas MJ, Bruggeling CE, Schürch AC, van Ham PM, Imhof SM, Nijhuis M, Wiertz EJ, Lebbink RJ | title = CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing of Herpesviruses Limits Productive and Latent Infections | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = e1005701 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27362483 | pmc = 4928872 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005701 | laysummary = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQaWh8VLkiU | laysource = PLOS Media YouTube Channel }}&lt;/ref&gt; CRISPR is being applied to develop tissue-based treatments for cancer and other diseases.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27595406"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu Y, Zhan Y, Chen Z, He A, Li J, Wu H, Liu L, Zhuang C, Lin J, Guo X, Zhang Q, Huang W, Cai Z | display-authors = 6 | title = Directing cellular information flow via CRISPR signal conductors | journal = Nature Methods | volume =  13| issue =  11| date = September 2016 | pmid = 27595406 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.3994 | pages=938–944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRISPR may revive the concept of [[Xenotransplantation|transplanting]] animal organs into people. [[Retroviruses]] present in animal genomes could harm transplant recipients. In 2015, a team eliminated 62 copies of a retrovirus's DNA from the pig genome in a kidney epithelial cell.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough"/&gt; Researchers recently demonstrated the ability to birth live pig specimens after removing these retroviruses from their genome using CRISPR for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608579/crispr-opens-up-new-possibilities-for-transplants-using-pig-organs/|title=Using CRISPR on pigs could make their organs safer for human transplant|last=Mullin|first=Emily | name-list-format = vanc |work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRISPR may have applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, such as by creating human blood vessels that lack expression of [[MHC class II]] proteins, which often cause transplant rejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abrahimi P, Chang WG, Kluger MS, Qyang Y, Tellides G, Saltzman WM, Pober JS | title = Efficient gene disruption in cultured primary human endothelial cells by CRISPR/Cas9 | journal = Circulation Research | volume = 117 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–8 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25940550 | pmc = 4490936 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.306290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CRISPR in cancer ====
{{as of|2016}} CRISPR had been studied in animal models and cancer cell lines, to learn if it can be used to repair or thwart mutated genes that cause [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khan FA, Pandupuspitasari NS, Chun-Jie H, Ao Z, Jamal M, Zohaib A, Khan FA, Hakim MR, ShuJun Z | title = CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutics: a cure for cancer and other genetic diseases | journal = Oncotarget | volume = 7 | issue = 32 | pages = 52541–52552 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27250031 | pmc = 5239572 | doi = 10.18632/oncotarget.9646 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first clinical trial involving CRISPR started in 2016. It involved removing immune cells from people with lung cancer, using CRISPR to edit out the gene expressed PD-1, then administrating the altered cells back to the same person. 20 other trials were under way or nearly ready, mostly in China, {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Michael | last = Le Page | name-list-format = vanc | title=Boom in human gene editing as 20 CRISPR trials gear up|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2133095-boom-in-human-gene-editing-as-20-crispr-trials-gear-up/|work=New Scientist|date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Food and Drug Administration|United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved a clinical trial in which CRISPR would be used to alter T cells extracted from people with different kinds of cancer and then administer those engineered T cells back to the same people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature.2016.20137 |title=First CRISPR clinical trial gets green light from US panel |journal=Nature |year=2016 |last1=Reardon |first1=Sara | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, the company CRISPR Therapeutics received approval to start a clinical trial with a CRISPR-based treatment for the blood disorder beta-thalassemia, which is scheduled to start in late 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://labiotech.eu/medical/crispr-therapeutics-clinical-trials/|title=CRISPR Therapeutics Plans First CRISPR Clinical Trial in Europe for 2018|date=2017-12-13|work=Labiotech.eu|access-date=2018-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://genomemag.com/2018/05/crispr-beta-thalassemia-treatment-approved-for-clinical-trial-in-europe/|title=CRISPR Beta-Thalassemia Treatment Approved for Clinical Trial in Europe|work=Genome Magazine|access-date=2018-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene function ===
In 2015, multiple studies attempted to systematically disable each individual human gene, in an attempt to identify which genes were essential to human biology. Between 1,600 and 1,800 genes passed this test—of the 20,000 or so known human genes. Such genes are more strongly activated, and unlikely to carry disabling mutations. They are more likely to have indispensable counterparts in other species. They build proteins that unite to form larger collaborative complexes. The studies also cataloged the essential genes in four cancer-cell lines and identified genes that are expendable in healthy cells, but crucial in specific tumor types and drugs that could target these rogue genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Revolutionary Gene-Editing Technique That Reveals Cancer's Weaknesses|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/11/a-revolutionary-gene-editing-technique-reveals-cancers-weaknesses/417495/|website = The Atlantic|access-date = 2016-02-21 | first = Ed | last = Yong | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific functions of some 18 percent of the essential genes are unidentified. In one 2015 targeting experiment, disabling individual genes in groups of cells attempted to identify those involved in resistance to a [[melanoma]] drug. Each such gene manipulation is itself a separate "drug", potentially opening the entire genome to CRISPR-based regulation.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough" /&gt;

=== ''In vitro'' genetic depletion ===
Unenriched sequencing libraries often have abundant undesired sequences. Cas9 can specifically deplete the undesired sequences with double strand breakage with up to 99% efficiency and without significant [[Off-target genome editing|off-target effects]] as seen with [[restriction enzyme]]s. Treatment with Cas9 can deplete abundant rRNA while increasing pathogen sensitivity in RNA-seq libraries.&lt;ref name="pmid26944702"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gu W, Crawford ED, O'Donovan BD, Wilson MR, Chow ED, Retallack H, DeRisi JL | title = Depletion of Abundant Sequences by Hybridization (DASH): using Cas9 to remove unwanted high-abundance species in sequencing libraries and molecular counting applications | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 41 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26944702 | pmc = 4778327 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-016-0904-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''In vivo'' applications ===
CRISPR/Cas-9 can be used to edit the DNA of organisms ''in vivo'' and entire chromosomes can be eliminated from an organism at any point in its development. Chromosomes that have been deleted ''in vivo'' are the Y chromosomes and X chromosomes of adult lab mice and human chromosomes 14 and 21, in embryonic stem cell lines and [[aneuploid]] mice respectively. This method might be useful for treating genetic aneuploid diseases such as [[Down Syndrome]] and [[intersex]] disorders.&lt;ref name="pmid29178945"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zuo E, Huo X, Yao X, Hu X, Sun Y, Yin J, He B, Wang X, Shi L, Ping J, Wei Y, Ying W, Wei W, Liu W, Tang C, Li Y, Hu J, Yang H | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted chromosome elimination | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 224 | year = 2017 | pmid = 29178945 | pmc = 5701507 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-017-1354-4 | lay-summary = https://www.genomeweb.com/gene-silencinggene-editing/crispr-used-eliminate-targeted-chromosomes-new-study | lay-source= Genome Web }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have been raised that [[Off-target genome editing|off-target effects]] (editing of genes besides the ones intended) may obscure the results of a CRISRP gene editing experiment (the observed phenotypic change may not be due to modifying the target gene, but some other gene).  Modifications to CRISRP have been made to minimize the possibility of off-target effects.

{{as of|2014|December}}, [[patent rights]] to CRISPR were contested.

As of November 2018, All the CRISPR patent holders and institutes associated with them have set up companies to commercialize the patents by sub-licensing them for therapeutic, agriculture and many other application areas to biotech firms, pharmaceuticals, agri-businesses etc. Caribou Biosciences, ERS Genomics, Editas Medicine, Intellia Therapeutics, and CRISPR Therapeutics are the spin offs associated with CRISPR landscape. Not many large scale commercial assignees have actively participated in the early phases of the CRISPR–Cas patent landscape. The only large establishments making it to the top ten are Dow AgroSciences and DuPont Nutrition Science (now merged as DowDuPont), together holding 20 inventions in CRISPR-Cas9 applications in agriculture and animal biotechnology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prweb.com/releases/2018/11/prweb15924785.htm|title=CRISPR Cas9 Genome Editing Market Worth $5.3 Billion by 2025|work=PRWeb|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Human germline modification ===

As of March 2015, multiple groups had announced ongoing research to learn how they one day might apply CRISPR to human embryos, including labs in the US, China, and the UK, as well as US biotechnology company [[OvaScience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Antonio | last = Regalado | name-list-format = vanc | journal = MIT Technology Review | date = March 5, 2015 | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/535661/engineering-the-perfect-baby/ | title = Engineering the Perfect Baby }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists, including a CRISPR co-discoverer, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use. They said "scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans" until the full implications "are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations".&lt;ref name="SCI-20150319"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baltimore D, Berg P, Botchan M, Carroll D, Charo RA, Church G, Corn JE, Daley GQ, Doudna JA, Fenner M, Greely HT, Jinek M, Martin GS, Penhoet E, Puck J, Sternberg SH, Weissman JS, Yamamoto KR | title = Biotechnology.

In April 2015, Chinese scientists reported results of an attempt to alter the [[DNA]] of non-viable [[human embryos]] using CRISPR to correct a [[mutation]] that causes [[beta thalassemia]], a lethal heritable disorder.&lt;ref name="LiangXu2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liang P, Xu Y, Zhang X, Ding C, Huang R, Zhang Z, Lv J, Xie X, Chen Y, Li Y, Sun Y, Bai Y, Songyang Z, Ma W, Zhou C, Huang J | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes | journal = Protein &amp; Cell | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 363–72 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25894090 | pmc = 4417674 | doi = 10.1007/s13238-015-0153-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150423"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolata | first = Gina  | name-list-format = vanc | title=Chinese Scientists Edit Genes of Human Embryos, Raising Concerns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/health/chinese-scientists-edit-genes-of-human-embryos-raising-concerns.html |date=23 April 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study had previously been rejected by both ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in part because of ethical concerns.&lt;ref name=NatureNews&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature.2015.17378 |title=Chinese scientists genetically modify human embryos |journal=Nature |year=2015 |last1=Cyranoski |first1=David |last2=Reardon |first2=Sara | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments resulted in successfully changing only some of the intended genes, and had [[Off-target effects of genome editing|off-target effects]] on other genes. The researchers stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in [[reproductive medicine]].&lt;ref name=NatureNews/&gt; In April 2016, Chinese scientists were reported to have made a second unsuccessful attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR - this time to alter the [[CCR5]] gene to make the embryo HIV resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601235/chinese-researchers-experiment-with-making-hiv-proof-embryos/|title=Chinese Researchers Experiment with Making HIV-Proof Embryos|last=Regalado|first=Antonio|name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-05-08|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, an International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of [[David Baltimore]]. Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. They agreed to support basic and clinical research under certain legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between [[somatic cells]], where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes could be inherited by descendants. Heritable modifications could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. [[Social Darwinism]]). Altering of [[gametocytes]] and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was defined to be irresponsible. The group agreed to initiate an international forum to address such concerns and harmonize regulations across countries.&lt;ref name="National Academy of Science"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12032015a | date =3 December 2015 | title = International Summit on Gene Editing | publisher =[[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] | accessdate = 3 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, [[He Jiankui]] announced that he had edited two human embryos, to attempt to disable the gene for [[CCR5]], which codes for a receptor that [[HIV]] uses to enter cells. He said that twin girls, Lulu and Nana, had been born a few weeks earlier.  He said that the girls still carried functional copies of CCR5 along with disabled CCR5 ([[mosaicism]]) and were still vulnerable to HIV.  The work was widely condemned as unethical, dangerous, and premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Begley |first1=Sharon |title=Amid uproar, Chinese scientist defends creating gene-edited babies - STAT |url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/28/chinese-scientist-defends-creating-gene-edited-babies/ |work=STAT |date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy barriers to genetic engineering ===

Policy regulations for the CRISPR/cas9 system vary around the globe. In February 2016, British scientists were given permission by regulators to genetically modify [[human embryos]] by using CRISPR-Cas9 and related techniques. However, researchers were forbidden from implanting the embryos and the embryos were to be destroyed after seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Callaway E | title = UK scientists gain licence to edit genes in human embryos | journal = Nature | volume = 530 | issue = 7588 | pages = 18 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26842037 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2016.19270 | bibcode = 2016Natur.530...18C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US has an elaborate, interdepartmental regulatory system to evaluate new genetically modified foods and crops. For example, the [[Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000]] gives the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] the authority to oversee the detection, control, eradication, suppression, prevention, or retardation of the spread of plant pests or noxious weeds to protect the agriculture, environment and economy of the US. The act regulates any [[genetically modified organism]] that utilizes the genome of a predefined 'plant pest' or any plant not previously categorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McHughen A, Smyth S | title = US regulatory system for genetically modified [genetically modified organism (GMO), rDNA or transgenic] crop cultivars | journal = Plant Biotechnology Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–12 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17956539 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7652.2007.00300.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Yinong Yang successfully deactivated 16 specific genes in the white button mushroom. Since he had not added any foreign DNA to his organism, the mushroom could not be regulated by the USDA under Section 340.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aphis.usda.gov/biotechnology/downloads/reg_loi/15-321-01_air_response_signed.pdf|title=Re: Request to confirm &lt;!-- too lazy to type --&gt;|author=USDA|authorlink=USDA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yang's white button mushroom was the first organism genetically modified with the Crispr/cas9 protein system to pass US regulation.&lt;ref name="Waltz_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Waltz E | title = Gene-edited CRISPR mushroom escapes US regulation | journal = Nature | volume = 532 | issue = 7599 | pages = 293 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27111611 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2016.19754 | bibcode = 2016Natur.532..293W }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the USDA sponsored a committee to consider future regulatory policy for upcoming genetic modification techniques. With the help of the US [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine]], special interests groups met on April 15 to contemplate the possible advancements in genetic engineering within the next 5 years and potential policy regulations that would need to come into play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledford H | title = Gene-editing surges as US rethinks regulations | journal = Nature | volume = 532 | issue = 7598 | pages = 158–9 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27075074 | doi = 10.1038/532158a | bibcode = 2016Natur.532..158L }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of rogue genetic engineers employing the technology, the [[FDA]] has begun issuing new regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/02/the-fda-is-cracking-down-on-rogue-genetic-engineers/ "The FDA Is Cracking Down On Rogue Genetic Engineers"], Kristen V. Brown. Gizmodo. February 1, 2017. Retrieved 5 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, and 2013, CRISPR was a runner-up in ''[[Science Magazine]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s [[Breakthrough of the Year]] award. In 2015, it was the winner of that award.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough"/&gt; CRISPR was named as one of ''[[MIT Technology Review]]''{{'}}s 10 breakthrough technologies in 2014 and 2016.&lt;ref name="MITCRISPR"&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Talbot | first1 = David | name-list-format = vanc | title = Precise Gene Editing in Plants/ 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2016 |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/600765/10-breakthrough-technologies-2016-precise-gene-editing-in-plants/ |accessdate=18 March 2016 | work = MIT Technology review | publisher = Massachusetts Institute of Technology|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MITGene"&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Larson | first1 = Christina | last2 = Schaffer | first2 = Amanda | name-list-format = vanc | title=Genome Editing/ 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2014 | url  =https://www.technologyreview.com/s/526511/genome-editing/ | accessdate=18 March 2016 | publisher  =Massachusetts Institute of Technology | date = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Jennifer Doudna]], [[Emmanuelle Charpentier]], along with Rudolph Barrangou, [[Philippe Horvath]], and [[Feng Zhang]] won the Gairdner International award.

The '''Chinese Text Project''' (CTP; {{zh|t=中國哲學書電子化計劃}}) is a [[digital library]] project that assembles collections of [[Chinese classics|early Chinese texts]]. The name of the project in Chinese literally means "The Chinese Philosophical Book Digitization Project", showing its focus on books related to [[Chinese philosophy]]. It aims at providing accessible and accurate versions of a wide range of texts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.princeton.edu/chinese-historiography/electronic-resources/databases-electronic-text/ | title = Classical Historiography for Chinese History: Databases &amp; electronic texts | last = Elman | first = Benjamin A. | publisher = Princeton University | access-date = June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly those relating to Chinese philosophy, and the site is credited with providing one of the most comprehensive and accurate collections of classical Chinese texts on the Internet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acpa-net.org/scholarship.html Association of Chinese Philosophers in North America (北美中国哲学学者协会)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cjfraser.net/links/#etext Chris Fraser], Department of Philosophy, University of Hong Kong&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being one of the most useful textual databases for scholars of early Chinese texts.&lt;ref&gt;http://warpweftandway.com/support-the-chinese-text-project/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://languagehat.com/chinese-text-project/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site contents==

Texts are divided into pre-Qin and Han texts, and post-Han texts, with the former categorized by [[Hundred Schools of Thought|school of thought]] and the latter by [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty]]. The ancient (pre-Qin and Han) section of the database contains over 5 million Chinese characters, the post-Han database over 20 million characters, and the publicly editable [[wiki]] section over 5 billion characters.&lt;ref name="ctext.org"&gt;http://ctext.org/system-statistics&lt;/ref&gt; Many texts also have English and Chinese translations, which are paired with the original text paragraph by paragraph as well as phrase by phrase for ease of comparison; this makes it possible for the system to be used as a useful scholarly research tool even by students with little or no knowledge of Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Connolly | first = Tim | date = 2012 | title = Learning Chinese Philosophy with Commentaries | url = https://www.pdcnet.org/teachphil/content/teachphil_2012_0035_0001_0001_0018 | journal = Teaching Philosophy | publisher = Philosophy Documentation Center | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–18 | access-date= March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as providing customized search functionality suited to Chinese texts,&lt;ref&gt;http://ctext.org/instructions/advanced-search&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ctext.org/faq/normalization&lt;/ref&gt; the site also attempts to make use of the unique format of the web to offer a range of features relevant to [[Sinology|sinologists]], including an integrated dictionary, word lists, parallel passage information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sturgeon | first = Donald | date = 2017 | title = Unsupervised identification of text reuse in early Chinese literature | url = https://dsturgeon.net/text-reuse-chinese-literature/ | journal = Digital Scholarship in the Humanities | publisher = Oxford University Press | access-date= November 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; scanned source texts, concordance and index data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Xu | first = Jiajin | date = 2015 | title = Corpus-based Chinese studies: A historical review from the 1920s to the present | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jbp/cld/2015/00000006/00000002/art00006 | journal = Chinese Language &amp; Discourse | publisher = John Benjamins Publishing Company | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 218–244 | access-date= June 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a metadata system, Chinese commentary display,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Adkins | first = Martha A. | date = 2016 | title = Web Review: Online Resources for the Study of Chinese Religion and Philosophy | url = https://theolib.atla.com/theolib/article/view/435/1515 | journal = Theological Librarianship | publisher = American Theological Library Association | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 5–8 | access-date= November 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a published resources database, and a discussion forum in which threads can be linked to specific data on the site.&lt;ref&gt;Holger Schneider and Jeff Tharsen, http://dissertationreviews.org/archives/9213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ctext.org/introduction&lt;/ref&gt; The "Library" section of the site also includes scanned copies of over 25 million pages of early Chinese texts,&lt;ref&gt;http://ctext.org/library.pl?if=en&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ctext.org"/&gt; linked line by line to transcriptions in the full-text database, many creating using Optical Character Recognition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Sturgeon | first = Donald | date = 2017 | title = Unsupervised Extraction of Training Data for Pre-Modern Chinese OCR. | url = https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FLAIRS/FLAIRS17/paper/view/15490/15011 | conference = The Thirtieth International Flairs Conference | publisher = AAAI | access-date= November 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and edited and maintained using an online crowd-sourcing wiki system.&lt;ref name="cpi"&gt;https://cpianalysis.org/2016/06/08/crowdsourcing-apis-and-a-digital-library-of-chinese/, China Policy Institute, University of Nottingham&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ctext.org/instructions/ocr&lt;/ref&gt; Textual data and metadata can also be exported using an [[Application Programming Interface]], allowing integration with other online tools as well as use in [[text mining]] and [[digital humanities]] projects.&lt;ref name="cpi" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ctext.org/tools/api&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5777">[[Image:Master clock system.png|thumb|Diagram of electric time system used around 1910 to keep time in factories, schools, and other large institutions.  The [[master clock]], controlled by a temperature-compensated mercury pendulum, is wired to [[slave clock]]s throughout the building.  In addition to wall clocks, it also controls [[time stamp]]s that are used to stamp documents with the time, and a [[turret clock]] that is installed in a clock tower. The "program clock" is a [[timer]] that can be programmed with [[Punched tape|punched paper tape]] to ring bells or turn machines on and off at preprogrammed times.]]

A '''clock network''' or '''clock system''' is a set of synchronized  [[clock]]s designed to always show exactly the same time by communicating with each other.  Clock networks usually consist of a central [[master clock]] kept in sync with an official time source, and one or more [[slave clock]]s which receive and display the time from the master.

== Synchronization sources ==
The master clock in a clock network can receive accurate time in a number of ways: through the [[United States]] [[GPS]] satellite constellation, a [[Network Time Protocol]] server, the [[CDMA]] cellular phone network, a [[modem]] connection to a time source, or by listening to radio transmissions from [[WWV (radio station)|WWV]] or [[WWVH]], or a special signal from an upstream broadcast network.  Some master clocks don't determine the time automatically.  Instead, they rely on an operator to manually set them.

Clock networks in critical applications often include a backup source to receive the time, or provisions to allow the master clock to maintain the time even if it loses access to its primary time source.  For example, many master clocks can use the reliable [[radio frequency|frequency]] of the [[alternating current]] line they are connected to.

== Slave clocks ==
Slave clocks come in many shapes and sizes.  They can connect to the master clock through either a cable or a short-range wireless signal. In the 19th century Paris used a series of pneumatic tubes to transmit the signal.&lt;ref name=Bruton172&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruton |first=Eric |date=2000 |title=The History of Clocks &amp; Watches |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |page=172 |isbn=0316853550}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Some slave clocks will run independently if they lose the master signal, often with a warning light lit.  Others will freeze until the connection is restored.

== Clock synchronization ==
{{main|Clock synchronization}}
Many master clocks include the capability to synchronize devices like computers to the master clock signal.  Common features include the transmission of the time via [[RS-232]], a Network Time Protocol, or a [[Pulse per second|Pulse Per Second]] (PPS) contact.  Others provide [[SMPTE]] time code outputs, which are often used in television settings to synchronize the video from multiple sources.  Master Clocks often come equipped with programmable relay outputs to synchronize other devices such as lights, doors, etc.

== Applications ==
One of the driving factors in developing clock networks was the broadcast industry.  [[Television]], in particular, operates on a very strict schedule, where each second of airtime is planned ahead of time and must be executed precisely.  A central clock system allows a television station's [[master control]] and [[Television producer|production]] personnel to work within that schedule.  A clock network synchronized to the standard [[UTC]] time also allows different television facilities to coordinate their activities without complicated out-of-band signaling.  It also provides accurate timing to equipment in stations that are becoming increasingly automated.

While television broadcasters were some of the first users of clock networks, the equipment is becoming increasingly useful in other industries.  For example, the [[National Emergency Number Association]] issued directive [http://www.nena.org/9%2D1%2D1techstandards/Standards_PDF/NENA%2004-002%20May%2000.pdf NENA-04-002], offering standards in timekeeping for 911 dispatch centers throughout the United States.  Other common clock network users include airports and schools.

== History ==

One of the first clock networks was installed by Charles Shepherd for the [[Great Exhibition]], held in London in 1851. Shepherd's technology was then installed at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]], and a replica of his [[Shepherd Gate Clock]] outside the gate is still working, the original being severely damaged in a WWII air raid.

In the period before the universal availability of A.C. mains or [[atomic clock]]s, many clock networks were installed using a highly accurate [[pendulum clock]] as a master clock.  This clock resembled a [[longcase clock]], but had a very robust mechanism and a less ornate case.  Electrical contacts attached to the mechanism generated minute, half minute and sometimes one second electrical pulses which were fed to the slave clocks on pairs of wires.  The devices driven could be wall clocks, employee time clocks, tower clocks and occasionally clock chiming mechanisms.  Some master clocks were set up to control the frequency of a generating authority's mains output; others, in the UK, were arranged to synchronise themselves with the [[Greenwich Time Signal]] pips.

'''Clothing technology''' involves the manufacturing, materials, and [[design]] innovations that have been developed and used. The [[timeline of clothing and textiles technology]] includes major changes in the manufacture and distribution of [[clothing]].

From [[clothing in the ancient world]] into modernity the use of technology has dramatically influenced clothing and [[fashion]] in the [[modern history|modern]] age. [[Industrialization]] brought changes in the manufacture of goods. In many nations, homemade goods [[craft]]ed by hand have largely been replaced by [[factory]] produced goods on [[assembly line]]s purchased in a [[consumer culture]]. Innovations include man-made materials such as [[polyester]], [[nylon]], and [[gramophone record|vinyl]] as well as features like [[zipper]]s and [[velcro]]. The advent of advanced electronics has resulted in [[wearable technology]] being developed and popularized since the 1980s. 

[[Design]] is an important part of the industry beyond utilitarian concerns and the [[fashion]] and [[Glamour (presentation)|glamour]] industries have developed in relation to clothing [[marketing]] and [[retail]]. [[Environmentalism|Environmental]] and [[human rights]] issues have also become considerations for clothing and spurred the promotion and use of some natural materials such as [[bamboo textiles|bamboo]] that are considered environmentally friendly. 

==Production==
The advent of industrialization included [[factory|factories]], specialized and technologically advanced equipment, and [[production line]]s for the [[mass production]] of [[textiles]]. [[Globalization]] and advances in trade increased sourcing of metrials and competition for wares across borders. The [[swadeshi movement]] in [[India]] was an effort to counteract the economic control and influence that British factories exerted over the one-time colony. Concerns have also been raised over the use of so-called [[sweat shops]]. 

[[Clothing line]]s based on famous [[clothing designer|designer]]s have been featured and advertised in magazines and other media. [[brand management|Branding]] and [marketing] are features of the [[advertising age]]. Some designers have also become television and media personalities. In recent years fashion and design has also been the subject of television shows.

==Sports==
The [[design]] and constructions of [[Sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] has changed dramatically over time. &lt;!-- should this be a separate article? --&gt; [[Swimwear]] used in competitions been developed including [[foam]]s, synthetic and stretchable [[athletic tape|tape]]s, and lightweight materials with performance characteristics specially designed for various athletics pursuits have been developed.

==Education==
[[Computer-aided design]] is used in the production of clothing. Corporate and business training to address accounting, trade, and finance issues has also become a significant part of the trade. Courses and programs at Universities specialize in these fields. the [[Beijing Institute of Clothing Technology]] and [[Fachhochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin]] are examples institutions focused on the business. National governments have also become involved in the business with [[trade rules]] and negotiations as well as investments such as Europe's [[Future Textiles and Clothing]] program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12512">'''Comfort behaviours''' in animals are activities that help maintain the [[Fur|pelage]], [[feathers]], [[Integumentary system|integuement]] or [[Human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal system]] and increase the physical comfort of the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-comfortbehaviour.html|title=Comfort behaviour|author=Allaby, M.|publisher=A Dictionary of Zoology |year=1999|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comfort behaviours are performed from an early age and change little during [[ontogeny|development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Paper/10888198https |author=Bekoff, M., Ainley, D.G and Bekoff, A.|title=The ontogeny and organisation of comfort behavior in Adelie penguins|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several comfort behaviours are associated with the beginning of a rest period (e.g. grooming), whereas others are associated with the end of a rest period (e.g. stretching), possibly to prepare the body for escape or hunting. Others, (e.g. [[dust bathing]]) will be performed only when the appropriate internal and external stimuli are present (see also [[sham dustbathing]]). Animals generally perform comfort behaviours only when they are not engaged in essential activities (e.g. feeding, drinking, hunting, escape); these behaviours are therefore sometimes categorised as ''luxury activities''. However, animals can be highly motivated to perform some comfort behaviours (e.g. dust bathing in hens), and conditions that thwart these behaviours (e.g. [[battery cages]]) are considered to have a negative influence on [[animal welfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg A.C. and Nicol C.J. (1997). Dustbathing in modified battery cages: Is sham dustbathing an adequate substitute? Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 55: 113-128&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose of Comfort Behaviours ==
There are many adaptive and functional purposes for comfort behaviours among a diverse group of animals. One function of comfort behaviours is hygiene, particularly in the form of ectoparasite removal. The animal removes the ectoparasites through the scratching or brushing of their own bodies,&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferron|first=J.|date=1976|title=Comfort behaviour of the red squirrel (tamiascilarus hudsonicus)|journal=Zeitshrift für Tierpsychologie|volume=42|pages=66–85|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1976.tb00957.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the grooming of others.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1020360422305&lt;/ref&gt; Through licking and brushing, animals such as the red squirrel clean wounds and remove dirt and debris from their bodies, also aiding in hygiene.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Other physical purposes for comfort behaviours includes reduction in heart rates as seen in horses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1309|title = Grooming at a preferred site reduces heart rate in horses| journal=Animal Behaviour| volume=46| issue=6| pages=1191–1194|year = 1993|last1 = Feh|first1 = Claudia| last2=De Mazières| first2=Jeanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[thermoregulation]].&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2004.10.020|title = Thermal behaviour of growing pigs in response to high temperature and humidity| journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science| volume=91| pages=1–16|year = 2005|last1 = Huynh|first1 = T.T.T.| last2=Aarnink| first2=A.J.A.| last3=Gerrits| first3=W.J.J.| last4=Heetkamp| first4=M.J.H.| last5=Canh| first5=T.T.| last6=Spoolder| first6=H.A.M.| last7=Kemp| first7=B.| last8=Verstegen| first8=M.W.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are reproductive purposes for comfort behaviours in several types of animals. It is necessary in the search for mating partners in animals such as the wren, where reciprocal and continued preening is involved in mating.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gill|first=S.A.|date=2012|title=Strategic use of allopreening in family-living wrens|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=66|issue=5|pages=757–763|doi=10.1007/s00265-012-1323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in chickens, dust bathing occurs as female sexual behaviour.&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vidal|first=J.M.|date=1971|title=Prosocial sexual behaviour: ontogeny of sexual behaviour in the domestic cock|journal=Behaviour|volume=39|pages=20–38|doi=10.1163/156853971x00159}}&lt;/ref&gt; During gestation, grooming and licking of areas critical for reproduction is increased in rats.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1967|title=Changes in self licking during pregnancy in the rat|journal=Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology|volume=63|issue=3|pages=397–400|doi=10.1037/h0024635|pmid=6070713|last1=Roth|first1=L. L.|last2=Rosenblatt|first2=J. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in cats, the mother cares for her newly born kittens through comfort behaviours, licking and rubbing the kitten's head.&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradshaw|first=J.W.S.|date=2016|title=Sociality in cats: a comparative review|journal=Journal of Veterinary Behavior: Clinical Applications and Research|volume=11|pages=113–124|doi=10.1016/j.jveb.2015.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Colobus_Monkey_Mom_and_Baby_(14393792022).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Colobus_Monkey_Mom_and_Baby_(14393792022).jpg|thumb|Mother monkey hugs her baby creating contact comfort.]]
Comfort behaviours can function to communicate socially during breeding season such as in the Degus,&lt;ref name=":73"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005|title=Seasonal changes in the time budget of degus. octodon degus|journal=Behaviour|volume=142|pages=91–112|doi=10.1163/1568539053627703|last1=Ebensperger|first1=Luis|last2=Hurtado|first2=Marí José}}&lt;/ref&gt; and form bonds and social structure within groups.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; It also can have implications on social outcomes of an animal. In infant monkeys it was found that contact comfort from their mothers was necessary to encourage positive social outcomes. The monkey's without those comfort behaviours developed fear and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1959|title=Affectional responses in infant monkey|journal=Science|volume=130|issue=3373|pages=421–432|doi=10.1126/science.130.3373.421|last1=Harlow|first1=H. F.|last2=Zimmermann|first2=R. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comfort behaviour has an important impact because in the absence of a mother, juvenile monkeys cling to each other for contact comfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1979|title=Handlers' effects on contact comfort behaviors of two trios of juvenile chimpanzees in the zoo|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=44|issue=3|pages=1015–1018|doi=10.2466/pr0.1979.44.3.1015|last1=Cooper|first1=Debra Lee|last2=Markowitz|first2=Hal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Comfort Behaviours ==

=== Autogrooming ===
[[File:Squirrel_Scratching_the_Armpit_with_its_Hindlimb.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Squirrel_Scratching_the_Armpit_with_its_Hindlimb.jpg|thumb|Squirrel scratching its armpit with its hindlimb claws - a process of autogrooming.]]
Autogrooming is any grooming behaviour performed by an animal on its own body. This behaviour typically includes licking, chewing, clawing, and rubbing.&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; This comfort behaviour is typically performed for hygienic purposes as seen in the red squirrel. The red squirrel removes parasites and dirt from its fur by licking and chewing its body (tail, belly and genitals), scratching harder to reach areas (such as under the legs) with its claws, brushing and rubbing facial areas with its front paws, or shaking its body and brushing against objects. This self-grooming increases in frequency during the spring when more black flies are present in the environment.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; In some animals such as the rat, autogrooming can have reproductive purposes. During pregnancy, the frequency of autogrooming in the critical reproductive areas, (nipple lines, genitals, and pelvis), increases whereas the frequency of licking in the areas not critical for reproduction decreased. As pregnancy progressed, the rate of licking in the critical areas increases.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;

=== Allogrooming ===
[[File:Cat_and_Kitten.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cat_and_Kitten.jpg|thumb|A mother cat licks the head of her kitten - a process of allogrooming.]]
[[Social grooming|Allogrooming]] is any behaviour performed by one animal on another. This behaviour could include licking, rubbing or preening.&lt;ref name=":63"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":33"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Allogrooming can have a reproductive function such as seen in wrens. Reciprocal preening initiated by either males or females can aid in mating.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Additionally, this comfort behaviour has a hygienic purpose as seen in red howlers and cats. In red howlers, the animals bodies, (including their necks, heads, shoulders and arms) to remove ectoparasites.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In domestic cats, mothers lick and rub their kittens heads to keep them clean. This maternal function soon evolves into a social function as the kittens begin to groom their mothers as well. This reciprocal grooming is a sign of affiliation and is necessary for group cohesion.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Allopreening is seen to have a social purpose again in red howlers,&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; showing that allogrooming has a variety of functions over a variety of species.

=== Dust Bathing ===
[[Dust bathing]] is the process of an animal covering themselves, or bathing themselves in dust. In bobwhite quail, the basic sequence of dust bathing is consistent with slight variations occurring in some components. The basic process for the quail is to peck at the dust, squat in the dust, disperse the dust over the body with its wings and feet, and shake off the dust. This process is linked to the oiling of the quail's feathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borchett|first=P.L.|date=1975|title=The organization of dustbathing components in bobwhite quail (colinus virginianus)|journal=Behaviour|volume=53|issue=3|pages=217–237|doi=10.1163/156853975x00209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dustbathing is also shown to have a reproductive function.&lt;ref name=":73"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":43"/&gt; In degus, males dust bathed more frequently during the breeding season.

For red deer, wallowing has a strong social function as it instills a social hierarchy and creates group cohesion. The young deers are integrated into the group through competition. The young deer initiates wallowing which attracts the dominant deer. It is here that competition is observed and integration of the young into the group occurs. Wallowing also occurs before group activity to help promote group cohesion and common activity synchronizes.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; In pigs, another function of wallowing is presented, thermoregulation. When presented with increased temperature and humidity, pigs will wallow to regulate their body temperature.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

A '''community of place''' or '''place-based community''' is a [[community]] of people who are bound together because of ''where'' they reside, work, visit or otherwise spend a continuous portion of their time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|quote="The 'spatial community' is that which is defined by geography (e.g. municipal boundary, health region)".|vauthors=Ramsey D, Beesley KB|url=http://www.rrh.org.au/articles/subviewnew.asp?ArticleID=850|title='Perimeteritis' and rural health in Manitoba, Canada: perspectives from rural healthcare managers|journal=Rural and Remote Health (Internet) |volume=7|issue=4|page=850|year=2007|pmid=18081449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a community can be a [[neighborhood]], [[town]], [[coffeehouse]], [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], [[gathering place]], [[public space]] or any other geographically specific place that a number of people share, have in common or visit frequently. A community offers many appealing features of a broader social relationship: Safety, familiarity, support and loyalties as well as appreciation. Appreciation that is founded on efforts and contribution to the community, rather than the efforts, rank or status of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aDMyfMqgdHEC|title=Community and the Politics of Place|last=Kemmis|first=Daniel|date=1992-01-01|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806124773|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in technology, transportation and communication have evolved the concept of place and the limits society once had in interactions with one another. With these advances, barriers have been lifted and distance is no longer such a great factor in anchoring the flow of people, goods or information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gieryn|first=Thomas F.|date=2000-01-01|title=A Space for Place in Sociology|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=26|pages=463–496|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.463|jstor=223453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variables of a community ==

When identifying what it is that makes a community, it is important to break it down and understand the components that sociologist have found that creates solidarity between the community and its members. German Sociologist and Philosopher Ferdinand Tönnies spoke of these components as evolutionary terms in his theoretical essay ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brint|first=Steven|date=March 2001|title=''Gemeinschaft'' Revisited: A Critique and Reconstruction of the Community Concept|url=http://www.asanet.org/images/members/docs/pdf/featured/soth125.pdf|journal=Sociological Theory|doi=10.1111/0735-2751.00125|pmid=|publisher=American Sociological Association|volume=19|pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (translated to Community and Society). ''Gemeinschaft'' would represent the childhood of humanity where as ''Gesellschaft'' would represent the maturity of humanity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft'' ===

''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' or community is smaller in number of members; its members usually share a common way of life (occupation/daily activities), common beliefs. Members have frequent interaction with one another as well as a tie of emotional bonds and distance from centers of power.

''[[Gesellschaft]]'' or society is much larger in terms of its members. Contrary to ''Gemeinschaft'', members do not share the same ways of life or beliefs. Members rarely interact with one another and have loose connections to each other. As well as being closer to establishments of power and regulated competitiveness among its members. This type of bond is most often found in urban communities that follow specific systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sharing the Cost and Benefits of Resource Activity|last=Barrera-Hernández|first=Lila|publisher=UOP Oxford|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defining "place" ===
A "place" should be thought of as a geographic location, its material form and the investments of meaning and value; the combination of these concepts make a "place" a place. Geographic location is important because this is used to identify what and where a place is. This concept gives individuals a sense of direction and reference to location. The material form is physicality of the place, whether it be artificially made like a building belonging to an institution or establishment or a natural from, such as a well known land mass. Finally, the meanings and value of place is the shared meaning or psych of a location. For example, the understanding of an area or neighborhood to reflect some historic value, prestigious families, Utopian or a dangerous.

A place is not space; Space can be though of distance, size, direction- usually descriptions of geometric items. Space however can become a place when filled with things spoken of earlier, such as: Cultural practices, things, values and of course people. People of a place are usually influenced or are at least conscious of the strong and unique influential forces a place passes onto its people. Every place will exhibit its own unique and independent force of influence that consequently generates social life.

If one of the three defining features (location, material form and meaningfulness) is analyzed as having greater importance than another defining feature, the identity and definition of place is quash. The focus, favoritism or forgotten of any key feature (when defining place) prevents social construction. A place is more than a variable of social life, it is in fact what molds together social life. Creating solidarity, cohesion to form what is social life. Place often becomes a lens people use to see life through. It impacts an individuals evaluation of others and their identity, political position and practices as well as a tool to measure one's own life.

=== Constructing place ===
The modern globalized world has had impact on the construction of place and the relationship among different places. Politicians, financial establishments, engineers and architects are just a few of the occupations we can look at to break down the construction of place. When looking at the architecture of a place, we are looking at its material form. This material, these structures an architect produces are symbols of the experiences, styles and cultural influence a place had or has on the individual. In fact the architect could as well construct structures to celebrate the history of an area, the achievements of a hero or heroine and compliment the surrounding area the structure will be built in. By doing so, the architect is creating a look or feel that people can associate with the area.

[[Globalization]] as well had impact on the social identity of a community, creating competition among all members of the globalized world. For example, larger "major cities" tend to be proud of its identity it has generated and will continue to pursue this identity. Inspiring smaller cities to pursue this identity as well or one of a new face. In this light, politicians and media play a role in constructing the use of land in a geographic area. Cities are built and develop cultural meaning that conform with economic interests.

People inhabiting a place as well help with validity and creation of place. Individuals assimilate the meaningfulness, functionality, name and identity of a space – especially the more in contact they are with the area. The homogeneity of design and architecture of a given neighborhood allows members to identify the class of people as well as name of the area. Quite similar to how people address personal occupation by uniform, the sameness of a given area works in a similar fashion. This same reasoning occurs with structures that are unique; its individuality stands out so much, people assign meaning and identity to it. As stated before, place is not only conceptualized as a location but by the meanings, functionality and qualities people assign to the social stuff that are there. "Place-Stratification" is a consequence of such identity creation: public or private, rich or poor, black or white, safe or dangerous, etc.

The same conceptualization is used on a larger scale; take nationalism or continents for example. Africa and Europe are not divided by physical features such as bodies of water or "real" borders. Instead they are divided among Geo-political borders that are impacted by cultural beliefs, social practices and overall homogeneity. Although these borders are created through personal whim the consequences of there actions on other place's are very real. For example, the impacts that imperialism and colonization had on the land and life-style of Natives.

== Functions of place ==
A place stabilizes social life and gives durability to social structures, creates [[Social stratification|social hierarchies]] and [[social network|network]]s as well as solidarity among its members through frequent face to face interactions, cultural norms, shared identities, memories and values.

However, there are two arguments made when creating community of place: engagement and estrangement. 
* Engagement: Sophistication, diversity, tolerance, public participation, integration, network formation, freedom and civil negotiation.  
* Estrangement: Anonymity, detachment, privatization, formal social controls, individualism, disconnection, isolation, lack of community or solidarity.

=== Stratification ===
Social arenas that are inviting and successfully make visitors feel comfortable – like, but not limited to, parks, libraries, and plazas – help to reinforce engagement among community members. These social arenas bring together a variety of different people and allow them to communicate, experience and learn differences of one another. Just as structures can be built to reinforce solidarity and engagement, the construction of social arenas can as well develop estrangement. Take neighborhoods that are closed off by gates or are further in distance from city centers, where access is limited by travelling at high speeds to and from in a private vehicle. Invisible barriers such as price of property and proximity to stores, workplaces and civic centers work as well as agents of social stratification – usually based on things such as race, ethnicity and/or gender.

=== Collective action ===
Place can work as a catalyst for [[collective action]] – social movements, protests, formation of labor unions, etc. As stated before, the solidarity that is created among individuals, the shared experiences and loyalty to members help with the formation of these movements. Researchers and their efforts have seen this phenomenon occur across multiple social movements and have dissected it so much so, they have pinpointed how proximity and solidarity has effected the response of collective action. The revolt of peasants in the Ottoman Empire during the seventeenth century is a good example of proximity and its effects of cohesion. Villages that were further from centers of political power were more likely to rally than elitist or people that were so far they were essentially isolated from political centers.

Loyalty, sentimental and emotional bonds are created between people as place brings them together. The attachment begins through biographical experiences: traumatic, fulfilling, even secret events that happen to individuals personally at that place. Other research explain that attachment is developed through proximity and shared cultural process like living in the same building and emotional meanings of hanging out and having a good time in a local coffee shop. Place attachment creates a sense of security and well-being as well as identifying oneself to a group and memories.

=== Norms ===
Place inscribes [[cultural norm]]s, [[Ethics|ethical]] beliefs and values in its members as well as shapes ideology around what is considered deviant or criminal behavior. There are debates on whether crime rates are affected by environment, demographic or economic variables.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5457">In [[ecology]], the '''competition–colonization trade-off''' is a [[Coexistence theory|stabilizing mechanism]] that has been proposed to explain [[species diversity]] in some biological systems, especially those that are not in equilibrium.&lt;ref name="hastings1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hastings|first1=Alan|title=Disturbance, coexistence, history, and competition for space|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=December 1980|volume=18|issue=3|pages=363–373|doi=10.1016/0040-5809(80)90059-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cadotte|first=Marc William|date=April 2007|title=Competition-colonization trade-offs and disturbance effects at multiple scales|journal=Ecology|volume=88|issue=4|pages=823–829|issn=0012-9658|pmid=17536699}}&lt;/ref&gt; In which case some species are particularly good at colonizing and others have well-established survival abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calcagno|first1=V|last2=Mouquet|first2=N|last3=Jarne|first3=P|last4=David|first4=P|title=Coexistence in a metacommunity: the competition– colonization trade-off is not dead|journal=Ecology Letters|date=2006|volume=9|pages=897–907}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The concept of the competition-colonization trade-off was originally proposed by Levins and Culver, the model indicated that two species could coexist if one had impeccable competition skill and the other was excellent at colonizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levins|first1=R|last2=Culver|first2=D|title=Regional coexistence of species and competition between rare species|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA|date=1971|volume=6|pages=1246–1248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model indicates that there is typically a trade-off, in which a species is typically better at either competing or colonizing. A later model, labelled The Lottery Model was also proposed, in which interspecific competition is accounted for within the population.

'''Mathematical Models:'''

''Levins and Culver Model:''

dp1/dt = c1p1(1 - p1) - m1p1. 

dp2/dt = c2p2(1 - p1 - p2) - m2p2 - c1p1p2.

Where:
pi = fraction of patches that are occupied by a species(i).
ci = colonization rate of species(i).
mi = mortality rate, independent of patch density.

Species 1 = competitor, can colonize in area that is not inhabited by species 2 (1 - p1).

Species 2 = colonizer, can only colonize in uninhabited areas (1 - p1 - p2).

Species 2 is subject to predator displacement (- c1p1p2).

If species 2 has a higher colonization rate it can coexist with species 1 (c2 &gt; c12/m).

This model is described as the displacement competition model, it has been observed in marine mollusks and fungi. This model makes two large assumptions: 
1. "a propagule of a superior competitor takes over a patch from an adult of the inferior competitor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=D|last2=Wilson|first2=H|title=The Competition-Colonization Trade-off Is Dead; Long Live the Competition-Colonization Trade-off|journal=The American Naturalist|date=2001|volume=158|pages=49–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
2. The adult must be displaced fast enough to ensure that it does not reproduce while it is being displaced.

''Lottery Model:''

dp1/dt = c1(f/(f + p2))p1(h - p1 - p2) m1p1.
dp2/dt = c2(g/(g + p1))p2(h - p1 - p2) m2p2.

Colonization rate is now described by interspecific competition.

(f/(f + p2)) and (g/(g + p1)). Both f and g &gt; 0.

An increase in p1 is related to a decrease in the colonization rate of species 2.

g &lt; f implies a competitive advantage of species 1 and c2 &gt; c1 implies a colonization advantage for species 2.

'''In Plants:'''

The competition-colonization trade-off theory has primarily been used to examine and describe the dispersal-linked traits of a plant's seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cadotte|first1=M|last2=Mai|first2=D|last3=Collins|first3=M|last4=Keele|first4=M|last5=Drake|first5=J|title=On testing the competition-colonization trade-off in a multispecies assemblage|journal=The American Naturalist|date=2006|volume=168|pages=704–709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seed size is a primary feature that relates to a species ability to colonize or compete within a given population, the effect of seed size was displayed in dicotyledonous annual plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turnbull|first1=L|last2=Coomes|first2=D|last3=Hector|first3=A|last4=Rees|first4=M|title=Seed mass and the competition/colonization trade-off: competitive interactions and spatial patterns in a guild of annual plants|journal=Journal of Ecology|date=2004|volume=92|pages=97–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turnbull and colleagues indicated that the competition/colonization trade-off has a stabilizing effect on the population of plants.

'''In Algae:'''

For example, in a classic study on an [[intertidal zone]] in [[Southern California]],&lt;ref name="sousa1979"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sousa|first1=Wayne P.|title=Disturbance in Marine Intertidal Boulder Fields: The Nonequilibrium Maintenance of Species Diversity|journal=Ecology|date=December 1979|volume=60|issue=6|pages=1225|doi=10.2307/1936969}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was shown that when a boulder was overturned, it would quickly be colonized by [[green algae]] and [[barnacle]]s (which were better colonizers).  However, if left undisturbed, the boulders would eventually be overtaken by [[red algae]] (which was the stronger competitor in the long term).

==Synopsis==
In this book Seife concentrates on the [[information theory]], discussing various issues, such as decoherence and probability, relativity and [[quantum mechanics]], works of [[Alan Turing|Turing]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], entropy and superposition, etc.

==Review==
{{quote|The cosmos, as Seife depicts it, is a great big information swap meet. Objects enormous and minuscule are always encountering other objects and being affected by them in such a way that they “gather information” — not consciously, of course, but in the way that the mercury collected information about my boiling syrup. A pool ball that’s hit by another pool ball receives information about the speed and direction of the ball that hit it. [[Subatomic particles]] do the same. Of course, subatomic particles do a lot of things that are much more baffling than this, like existing in two different places at the same time until someone or something tries to locate them. But, as Seife argues, information still lies at the root of all this. “Decoding the Universe” offers a history of the development of information theory, too, beginning with the [[cryptographers]] of World War II.}}

In [[applied mathematics]], '''discretization''' is the process of transferring [[continuous function|continuous]] functions, models, variables, and equations into [[wiktionary:discrete|discrete]] counterparts.  This process is usually carried out as a first step toward making them suitable for numerical evaluation and implementation on digital computers. '''Dichotomization''' is the special case of discretization in which the number of discrete classes is 2, which can approximate a continuous variable as a [[binary variable]] (creating a [[dichotomy]] for [[conceptual model|modeling]] purposes, as in [[binary classification]]). 

Discretization is also related to [[discrete mathematics]], and is an important component of [[granular computing]].  In this context, ''discretization'' may also refer to modification of variable or category ''granularity'', as when multiple discrete variables are aggregated or multiple discrete categories fused.

Whenever continuous data is '''discretized''', there is always some amount of [[discretization error]]. The goal is to reduce the amount to a level considered [[wikt:negligible|negligible]] for the [[conceptual model|modeling]] purposes at hand.

{{Anchor|Discretization-quantization}} The terms ''discretization '' and ''[[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]]''&lt;!-- Do not tag bomb this link with {{dn}}; its target is at the intentional and appropriate level of polysemy. --&gt; often have the same [[denotation]] but not always identical [[connotations]].&lt;!-- If you need deeper exploration of this truth, you will need to go read about [[cognitive synonymy]] and the lack of it in natural language. --&gt; (Specifically, the two terms share a [[semantic field]].) The same is true of [[discretization error]] and [[quantization error]].

Mathematical methods relating to discretization include the [[Euler–Maruyama method]] and the [[zero-order hold]].

== Discretization of linear state space models {{anchor|discrete function}} ==
Discretization is also concerned with the transformation of continuous [[differential equation]]s into discrete [[difference equations]], suitable for [[Numerical analysis|numerical computing]].

The following continuous-time [[State space (controls)|state space model]]

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \mathbf A \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf B \mathbf{u}(t) + \mathbf{w}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \mathbf C \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf D \mathbf{u}(t) + \mathbf{v}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' and ''w'' are continuous zero-mean [[white noise]] sources with [[power spectral density | power spectral densities]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}(t) \sim N(0,\mathbf Q)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(t) \sim N(0,\mathbf R)&lt;/math&gt;

can be discretized, assuming [[zero-order hold]] for the input ''u'' and continuous integration for the noise ''v'', to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}[k+1] = \mathbf A_d \mathbf{x}[k] + \mathbf B_d \mathbf{u}[k] + \mathbf{w}[k]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}[k] = \mathbf C_d \mathbf{x}[k] + \mathbf D_d \mathbf{u}[k] +  \mathbf{v}[k]&lt;/math&gt;

with covariances

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}[k] \sim N(0,\mathbf Q_d)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}[k] \sim N(0,\mathbf R_d)&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A_d = e^{\mathbf A T} = \mathcal{L}^{-1}\{(s\mathbf I - \mathbf A)^{-1}\}_{t=T} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf B_d = \left( \int_{\tau=0}^{T}e^{\mathbf A \tau}d\tau \right) \mathbf B = \mathbf A^{-1}(\mathbf A_d - I)\mathbf B &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt; is [[Invertible matrix|nonsingular]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf C_d = \mathbf C &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf D_d = \mathbf D &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf Q_d = \int_{\tau=0}^{T} e^{\mathbf A \tau} \mathbf Q e^{\mathbf A^\top \tau}  d\tau &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf R_d = \mathbf R T &lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the sample time, although &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A^\top&lt;/math&gt; is the transposed matrix of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;.

A clever trick to compute ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; in one step is by utilizing the following property:&lt;ref&gt;Raymond DeCarlo: ''Linear Systems: A State Variable Approach with Numerical Implementation'', Prentice Hall, NJ, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 215}}
:&lt;math&gt;e^{\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{A} &amp; \mathbf{B} \\
                 \mathbf{0} &amp; \mathbf{0} \end{bmatrix} T} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{M_{11}} &amp; \mathbf{M_{12}} \\
                                                            \mathbf{0} &amp; \mathbf{I} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and then having
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A_d = \mathbf M_{11}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf B_d = \mathbf M_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Discretization of process noise ===
Numerical evaluation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}_d&lt;/math&gt; is a bit trickier due to the matrix exponential integral. It can, however, be computed by first constructing a matrix, and computing the exponential of it &lt;ref&gt;Charles Van Loan: ''Computing integrals involving the matrix exponential'', IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control. 23 (3): 395–404, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = 
\begin{bmatrix} -\mathbf{A} &amp; \mathbf{Q} \\
                 \mathbf{0} &amp; \mathbf{A}^\top \end{bmatrix} T&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{G} = e^\mathbf{F} =
\begin{bmatrix} \dots &amp; \mathbf{A}_d^{-1}\mathbf{Q}_d \\
           \mathbf{0} &amp; \mathbf{A}_d^\top             \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
The discretized process noise is then evaluated by multiplying the transpose of the lower-right partition of '''G''' with the upper-right partition of '''G''':
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}_d = (\mathbf{A}_d^\top)^\top (\mathbf{A}_d^{-1}\mathbf{Q}_d) = \mathbf{A}_d (\mathbf{A}_d^{-1}\mathbf{Q}_d). &lt;/math&gt;

=== Derivation ===
Starting with the continuous model
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\dot{x}}(t) = \mathbf A\mathbf x(t) + \mathbf B \mathbf u(t)&lt;/math&gt;
we know that the [[matrix exponential]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}e^{\mathbf At} = \mathbf A e^{\mathbf At} = e^{\mathbf At} \mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;
and by premultiplying the model we get
:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\mathbf At} \mathbf{\dot{x}}(t) = e^{-\mathbf At} \mathbf A\mathbf x(t) + e^{-\mathbf At} \mathbf B\mathbf u(t)&lt;/math&gt;
which we recognize as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-\mathbf At}\mathbf x(t)) = e^{-\mathbf At} \mathbf B\mathbf u(t)&lt;/math&gt;
and by integrating..
:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\mathbf At}\mathbf x(t) - e^0\mathbf x(0) = \int_0^t e^{-\mathbf A\tau}\mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d\tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t) = e^{\mathbf At}\mathbf x(0) + \int_0^t e^{\mathbf A(t-\tau)} \mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d \tau&lt;/math&gt;
which is an analytical solution to the continuous model.

Now we want to discretise the above expression. We assume that u is [[mathematical constant|constant]] during each timestep.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k] \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \mathbf x(kT)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k] = e^{\mathbf AkT}\mathbf x(0) + \int_0^{kT} e^{\mathbf A(kT-\tau)} \mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d \tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k+1] = e^{\mathbf A(k+1)T}\mathbf x(0) + \int_0^{(k+1)T} e^{\mathbf A((k+1)T-\tau)} \mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d \tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k+1] = e^{\mathbf AT} \left[  e^{\mathbf AkT}\mathbf x(0) + \int_0^{kT} e^{\mathbf A(kT-\tau)} \mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d \tau \right]+ \int_{kT}^{(k+1)T} e^{\mathbf A(kT+T-\tau)} \mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d \tau&lt;/math&gt;
We recognize the bracketed expression as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k]&lt;/math&gt;, and the second term can be simplified by substituting with the function &lt;math&gt;v(\tau) = kT + T - \tau&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;d\tau=-dv&lt;/math&gt;. We also assume that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is constant during the [[integral]], which in turn yields
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{matrix} \mathbf x[k+1]&amp;=&amp; e^{\mathbf AT}\mathbf x[k] - \left( \int_{v(kT)}^{v((k+1)T)} e^{\mathbf Av} dv \right) \mathbf B\mathbf u[k] \\
&amp;=&amp; e^{\mathbf AT}\mathbf x[k] - \left( \int_T^0 e^{\mathbf Av} dv \right) \mathbf B\mathbf u[k] \\
&amp;=&amp; e^{\mathbf AT}\mathbf x[k] + \left( \int_0^T e^{\mathbf Av} dv \right) \mathbf B\mathbf u[k] \\
&amp;=&amp;e^{\mathbf AT}\mathbf x[k] + \mathbf A^{-1}\left(e^{\mathbf AT}-\mathbf I \right) \mathbf B\mathbf u[k] \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
which is an exact solution to the discretization problem.

=== Approximations ===
Exact discretization may sometimes be intractable due to the heavy matrix exponential and integral operations involved. It is much easier to calculate an approximate discrete model, based on that for small timesteps &lt;math&gt;e^{\mathbf AT} \approx \mathbf I + \mathbf A T&lt;/math&gt;. The approximate solution then becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k+1] \approx (\mathbf I + \mathbf AT) \mathbf x[k] + T\mathbf B \mathbf u[k] &lt;/math&gt;

Other possible approximations are &lt;math&gt;e^{\mathbf AT} \approx \left( \mathbf I - \mathbf A T \right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^{\mathbf AT} \approx \left( \mathbf I +\frac{1}{2}  \mathbf A T \right) \left( \mathbf I - \frac{1}{2} \mathbf A T \right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Each of them have different stability properties. The last one is known as the [[bilinear transform]], or Tustin transform, and preserves the (in)stability of the continuous-time system.

{{wiktionary|durability}}
'''Durability''' is the ability of a physical [[product (business)|product]] to remain functional, without requiring excessive [[maintenance (technical)|maintenance]] or repair, when faced with the challenges of normal operation over its [[design life|design lifetime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|year=1994|title=Beyond Recycling: The longer life option|url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/24666/1/201125_7266%20Cooper%20Publisher.pdf|journal=The New Economics Foundation, Whitechapel Road, London|volume=|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} Several units may be used to measure the durability of a product according to its field of application, such as years of life, hours of use, and operational cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Longer Lasting Products: alternatives to the throwaway society|last=Stahel|first=Walter|publisher=Gower|year=2010|isbn=978-0-566-08808-7|editor-last=Cooper|editor-first=Tim|location=Farnham|pages=|chapter=Durability, Function and Performance|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[economics]], good with a long usable life are referred to as [[durable good]]s.

== Requirements for product durability ==
Product durability is predicated by good reparability and [[Regenerative design|regenerability]] in conjunction with [[Maintenance (technical)|maintenance]].&lt;ref name="durabilityBook"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-55840-0|pp=201–203|chapter=New Design Strategy – Product Durability|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every durable product must be capable of adapting to technical, technological and design developments.&lt;ref name=durabilityBook/&gt; This must be accompanied by a willingness on the part of consumers to forego having the "very latest" version of a product.

Durability as a characteristic relating to the quality of goods that can be demanded by consumers was not clearly established in the United Kingdom until an amendment of the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]]  relating to the quality standards for supplied goods in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Longer Lasting Products: alternatives to the throwaway society|last=Ervine|first=Cowan|publisher=Gower|year=2010|isbn=978-0-566-08808-7|editor-last=Cooper|editor-first=Tim|location=Farnham|pages=187-188|chapter=Durability and the Law|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product life spans and sustainable consumption ==
The lifespan of household goods is a significant factor in [[sustainable consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|year=1994|title=The durability of consumer durables|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bse.3280030103/full|journal=Business Strategy and the Environment|volume=3|issue=1|pages=23–30|via=Willey|doi=10.1002/bse.3280030103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longer product life spans can contribute to eco-efficiency and sufficiency, thus slowing consumption in order to progress towards a sustainable level of consumption.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|year=2005|title=Slower Consumption Reflections on Product Life Spans and the "Throwaway Society"|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1162/1088198054084671/abstract|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|volume=9|issue=1–2|pages=51–67|via=Willey|doi=10.1162/1088198054084671}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper (2005) proposed a model to demonstrate the crucial role of product life spans to sustainable production and consumption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18325">The '''Earth Charter''' is an international declaration of fundamental values and principles considered useful by its supporters for building a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. Created by a global consultation process, and endorsed by organizations representing millions of people, the Charter "seeks to inspire in all peoples a sense of global interdependence and shared responsibility for the well-being of the human family, the greater community of life, and future generations."&lt;ref&gt;Earth Charter Initiative: [http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/What-is-the-Earth-Charter%3F.html "What is the Earth Charter?"].&lt;/ref&gt; It calls upon humanity to help create a global partnership at a critical juncture in history. The Earth Charter's ethical vision proposes that [[environmental protection]], [[human rights]], equitable [[Human development (humanity)|human development]], and [[world peace|peace]] are interdependent and indivisible. The Charter attempts to provide a new framework for thinking about and addressing these issues. The [[Earth Charter Initiative]] organization exists to promote the Charter.

==History==
The idea of the Earth Charter originated in 1987, by [[Maurice Strong]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as members of The [[Club of Rome]], when the [[United Nations]] [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] called for a new charter to guide the transition to [[sustainable development]]. In 1992, the need for a charter was urged by then-[[Secretary General of the United Nations|Secretary General]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] at the [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Earth Summit]], but the time for such a declaration was not believed to be right. The [[Rio Declaration]] became the statement of the achievable consensus at that time. In 1994, [[Maurice Strong]] (Chairman of the Earth Summit) and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], working through organizations they each founded (the [[Earth Council]] and [[Green Cross International]] respectively), restarted the Earth Charter as a [[civil society]] initiative, with the help of the government of the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="mstrong"&gt;Maurice Strong: [http://www.mauricestrong.net/2009013070/earth-charter.html "History of the Earth Charter"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong died in November 2015.&lt;ref name="mstrong" /&gt;

"The Ark of Hope was created for a celebration of the Earth Charter held at Shelburne Farms, Vermont on September 9, 2001."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkofhope.org|title=Welcome|author=|date=|website=www.arkofhope.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drafting==
The drafting of the text was done during a six-year worldwide consultation process (1994–2000), overseen by the independent Earth Charter Commission, which was convened by Strong and Gorbachev with the purpose of developing a global consensus on values and principles for a sustainable future. The Commission continues to serve as the steward of the Earth Charter text.

One of the members of the Earth Charter Commission and Steering Committee was [[Steven Clark Rockefeller]], who, among other things is professor emeritus of Religion at [[Middlebury College]] and an advisory trustee of the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Steven C. Rockefeller |url=http://earthcharter.org/about/steven-c-rockefeller/ |website=earthcharter.org |accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2001 interview with Rockefeller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abroadview.org/stories/interviews/rockefeller.htm|title=Charting a New Course: An Interview with Steven Rockefeller|last=Schwarz|first=Sherry|date=2001|website=abroadview.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502055548/http://www.abroadview.org/stories/interviews/rockefeller.htm|archivedate=2 May 2008|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he "chaired the Earth Charter international drafting committee". Other members included [[Amadou Toumani Touré]] (Mali), [[Princess Basma bint Talal]] (Jordan), [[Mohamed Sahnoun]] (Algeria), [[A. T. Ariyaratne]] (Sri Lanka), [[Wakako Hironaka]] (Japan), [[Erna Witoelar]] (Indonesia), [[Ruud Lubbers]] (The Netherlands), [[Federico Mayor]] (Spain), [[Mercedes Sosa]] (Argentina), [[Leonardo Boff]] (Brazil), [[Yolanda Kakabadse]] (Ecuador), [[Shridath Ramphal]] (Guyana), [[Elizabeth May]] (Canada), [[Severn Cullis-Suzuki]] (Canada), and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commission |url=http://earthcharter.org/about-eci/commission/ |website=earthcharter.org |accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final text of the Earth Charter was approved at a meeting of the Earth Charter Commission at the [[UNESCO]] headquarters in Paris in March 2000. The official launch was on 29 June 2000 in a ceremony at The [[Peace Palace]] in [[The Hague]], Netherlands. [[Queen Beatrix]] of the Netherlands attended the ceremony.

== Contents ==
The approximately 2,400 word document is divided into sections (called pillars), which have sixteen main principles containing sixty-one supporting principles.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Dower, University of Aberdeen (2004): [http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/invent/images/uploads/The%20Earth%20Charter%20as%20a%20Global%20Ethic.pdf "The Earth Charter as a Global Ethic"], p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The document opens with a preamble and ends with a conclusion entitled “The Way Forward”.

===Preamble===
{{cquote|We stand at a critical moment in Earth's history, a time when humanity must choose its future. As the world becomes increasingly interdependent and fragile, the future at once holds great peril and great promise. To move forward we must recognize that in the midst of a magnificent diversity of cultures and life forms we are one human family and one Earth community with a common destiny. We must join together to bring forth a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature, universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture of peace. Towards this end, it is imperative that we, the peoples of Earth, declare our responsibility to one another, to the greater community of life, and to future generations.&lt;ref name="ECdoc"&gt;Earth Charter Initiative: [http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/Read-the-Charter.html "Text of the Earth Charter"].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Principles ===
The four pillars and sixteen principles of the Earth Charter are:&lt;ref name="ECdoc" /&gt;

'''I. Respect and Care for the Community of Life'''

In the UK, Bournemouth Borough Council endorsed the Charter in 2008.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Charter has received opposition from several groups. For example, in the [[United States]], members of religious groups, such as the [[Christian right|Religious Right]] have objected to the document on the grounds that it is [[secularism|secular]], and espouses [[socialism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009| reason=Please, provide a reliable source for this assertion. Nowhere on the Internet, I could find the mentioned objections.}} In addition, some conservatives{{Who|date=November 2009}} cite an informal comment by Mikhail Gorbachev that the document is "a kind of [[Ten Commandments]]" and point to the fact that at the 2002 [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], a copy of the document was placed symbolically in an "Ark of Hope" — an independent project by the American artist Sally Linder.

Earth Charter International, the organization responsible for promoting the Charter, states in its literature that the Earth Charter is respectful and inclusive of all religious traditions. They say that the Charter itself makes no statements to support claims of intent to supplant any of the world's religions or to create a world government. ECI asserts that the Charter is a statement of common ethical values towards sustainability, that recognizes humanity's shared responsibility to the Earth and to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Earth Charter Initiative.

'''Epoxide docosapentaenoic acids''' ('''epoxydocosapentaenoic acids''', '''EDPs''', or '''EpDPEs''') are metabolites of the 22-carbon straight-chain [[omega-3 fatty acid]], [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA).  Cell types that express certain cytochrome P450 (CYP) [[epoxygenase]]s metabolize [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]'s (PUFAs) by converting one of their double bonds to an [[epoxide]].  In the best known of these metabolic pathways, cellular CYP epoxygenases metabolize the 20-carbon straight-chain [[omega-6 fatty acid]], [[arachidonic acid]], to [[epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]s (EETs); another CYP epoxygenase pathway metabolizes the  20-carbon omega-3 fatty acid, [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), to [[epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid]]s (EEQs). CYP epoxygenases similarly convert various other PUFAs to epoxides (see [[epoxygenase]]) These epoxide metabolites have a variety of activities.  However, essentially all of them are rapidly converted to their corresponding, but in general far less active, [[Vicinal (chemistry)]] dihydroxy fatty acids by ubiquitous cellular [[Soluble epoxide hydrolase]] (sEH; also termed Epoxide hydrolase 2).  Consequently, these epoxides, including EDPs, operate as short-lived signaling agents that regulate the function of their parent or nearby cells.  The particular feature of EDPs (and EEQs) distinguishing them from EETs is that they derive from omega-3 fatty acids and are suggested to be responsible for some of the  beneficial effects attributed to omega-3 fatty acids and omega-3-rich foods such as [[fish oil]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25244930 | year = 2014 | author1 = Fleming | first1 = I | title = The pharmacology of the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase/soluble epoxide hydrolase axis in the vasculature and cardiovascular disease | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 4 | pages = 1106–40 | doi = 10.1124/pr.113.007781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
EDPs are [[epoxide]] eicosapentaenoic acid metabolites of DHA.  DHA has 6 cis (see [[Cis–trans isomerism]]) [[Double bond]]s each one of which is located between carbons 4-5, 7-8, 10-11, 13-14, 16-17, or 19-20. Cytochrome P450 epoxygenases attack any one of these double bounds to form a respective docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) epoxide regioisomer (see [[Structural isomer]], section on position isomerism (regioisomerism)).  A given epoxygenase may therefore convert DHA to 4,5-EDP (i.e. 4,5-epoxy-7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-DPA), 7,8-EDP (i.e. 7,8-epoxy-4''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-DPA), 10,11-EDP (i.e. 10,11-epoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-DPA), 13,14-EDP (i.e. 13,14-epoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-DPA), 16,17-EDP (i.e. 16,17-epoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',19''Z''-DPA, or 19,20-EDP (i.e. 19,20-epoxy-4''Z'', 7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z''-DPA. The epoxygenase enzymes generally form both ''R''/''S'' [[enantiomers]] at each former double bound position; for example, cytochrome P450 epoxidases attack DHA at the 16,17-double bond position to form two epoxide enantiomers, 16''R'',17''S''-EDP and 16''S'',17''S''-EDP.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25093613 | pmc = 4314516 | year = 2015 | author1 = Spector | first1 = A.

==Production==
Enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily that are classified as epoxygenases based on their ability to metabolize PUFA, particularly arachidonic acid, to epoxides include: CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP2C, CYP2E, CYP2J, and within the CYP3A subfamily, CYP3A4. In humans, [[CYP2C8]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2C19]], [[CYP2J2]], and possibly [[CYP2S1]] [[isoforms]] appear to be the principal epoxygenases responsible for metabolizing arachidonic acid to EETs (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid#Production]]).  In general, these same CYP epoxygenases also metabolize DHA to EDP (as well as EPA to EEQ; CYP2S1 has not yet been tested for DHA-metabolizing ability), doing so at rates that are often greater than their rates in metabolizing arachidonic acid to EETs; that is, DHA (and EPA) appear to be preferred over arachidonic acid as substrates for many of the CYP epoxygenases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25330284 | year = 2015 | author1 = Frömel | first1 = T | title = Whatever happened to the epoxyeicosatrienoic Acid-like endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor?

The EDPs are commonly made by the stimulation of specific cell types by the same mechanisms which produce EETs (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]).  That is, cell stimulation causes DHA to be released from the ''sn-2'' position of their membrane-bound cellular [[phospholipid]] pools through the action of a [[Phospholipase A2]]-type enzyme and the subsequent attack of the released DHA by CYP450 epoxidases. It is notable that the consumption of omega-3 fatty acid-rich diets dramatically raises the serum and tissue levels of EDPs and EEQs in animals as well as humans.  Indeed, this rise in EDP (and EEQ) levels in humans is by far the most prominent change in the profile of PUFA metabolites caused by dietary omega-3 fatty acids and, it is suggested, may be responsible for at least some of the beneficial effects ascribed to dietary omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J Lipid Res 1164"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24634501 | pmc = 4031946 | year = 2014 | author1 = Fischer | first1 = R | title = Dietary omega-3 fatty acids modulate the eicosanoid profile in man primarily via the CYP-epoxygenase pathway | journal = The Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 55 | issue = 6 | pages = 1150–1164 | last2 = Konkel | first2 = A | last3 = Mehling | first3 = H | last4 = Blossey | first4 = K | last5 = Gapelyuk | first5 = A | last6 = Wessel | first6 = N | last7 = von Schacky | first7 = C | last8 = Dechend | first8 = R | last9 = Muller | first9 = D.

==EDP metabolism==
Similar to EETs (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]), EDPs are rapidly metabolized in cells by a cytosolic [[soluble epoxide hydrolase]] (sEH, also termed Epoxide hydrolase 2 [EC 3.2.2.10.]) to form their corresponding [[Vicinal (chemistry)]] [[diol]] dihydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids. Thus, sEH converts 19,20-EDP to 19,10-dihdroxydocosapentaenoic acid (DPA), 16,17-EDP to 16,17-dihydroxy-DPA, 13,14-EDP to 13,14-dihydroxy-DPA, 10,11-EDP to 10,11-dihydroxy-DPA, and 7,8-EDP to 7,8-dihydroxy-EDP; 4,5-EDP is unstable and therefore generally not detected in cells.&lt;ref name="Gene p 10"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23701967 | pmc = 3733540 | year = 2013 | author1 = Harris | first1 = T.

In addition to the sEH pathway, EDPs, similar to the EETs, may be acylated into phospholipids in an [[Acylation]]-like reaction; this pathway may serve to limit the action of EETs or store them for future release.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  Finally, again similar to the EETs, EDPs are subject to inactivation by being further metabolized b [[Beta oxidation]].&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25240260 | pmc = 4254344 | year = 2014 | author1 = Wagner | first1 = K | title = The role of long chain fatty acids and their epoxide metabolites in nociceptive signaling | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 113-115 | pages = 2–12 | last2 = Vito | first2 = S | last3 = Inceoglu | first3 = B | last4 = Hammock | first4 = B.

==Clinical significance==
EDPs have not be studied nearly as well as the EETs.  This is particularly the case for animal studies into their potential clinical significance.  In comparison to a selection of the many activities attributed to the EETs (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]), animal studies reported to date find that certain EDPs (16,17-EDP and 19,20-EDP have been most often examined) are: '''1)''' more potent than EETs in decreasing hypertension and pain perception; '''2)''' more potent than or at least equal in potency to the EETs in suppressing inflammation; and '''3)''' act oppositely from the EETs in that EDPs inhibit [[angiogenesis]], endothelial cell migration, endothelial cell proliferation, and the growth and metastasis of human breast and prostate cancer cell lines whereas EETs have stimulatory effects in each of these systems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"/&gt; As indicated in the Metabolism section, consumption of omega-3 fatty acid-rich diets dramatically raises the serum and tissue levels of EDPs and EEQs in animals as well as humans and in humans is by far the most prominent change in the profile of PUFA metabolites caused by dietary omega-3 fatty acids. Hence, the metabolism of DHA to EDPs (and EPA to EEQs) may be responsible for at least some of the beneficial effects ascribed to dietary omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J Lipid Res 1164"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"/&gt;

"'''First Friday'''" is a name for various public events in some cities (particularly in the [[United States]]) that occur on the first [[Friday]] of every month.

These citywide events may take on many purposes, including art gallery openings, and social and political networking. American cities have promoted such events to bring people to historic areas perceived as dangerous, using the "[[safety in numbers]]" mentality to combat [[urban decay]].  In some cities this monthly event may occur on the first Saturday of each month instead of Friday or on "Third Thursdays".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=http://www.ait-themes.com|first1=AitThemes.com,|title=TAG :: Tacoma Art Group - 3rd Thursday Tacoma Art Mingle {{!}} 3rd Thursday Tacoma Art Mingle|url=http://www.tacomaartgroup.org/|website=www.tacomaartgroup.org|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://downtownjoplin.com/|website=Downtown Joplin Alliance|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Third Thursday|url=http://downtownjoplin.com/thirdthursday/|website=Downtown Joplin Alliance|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Systems|first1=eZ|title=3rd Thursday Loop / Events / Home - Toledo|url=http://www.dotoledo.org/Events/3rd-Thursday-Loop3|website=www.dotoledo.org|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, these are "see and be seen" events that serve as a [[block party]] or social gathering open to the general public. Some of these events may be centered on political networking by Republicans and Democrats, but usually First Fridays are art and entertainment destinations. They may involve [[pub crawl]]ing, other retail establishments such as cafes and restaurants, and performances by [[fire twirling]] acts, [[Jazz music|jazz musicians]], [[belly dancing]], street musicians, or others.

"First Fridays" is also a nationally recognized networking event targeting African American professionals held on the first Friday of every month in various cities throughout North America. These events started in 1987 and provide urban professionals an opportunity to socially network, exchange and share ideas on professional, educational, political and social issues.

==Art gallery openings==
Some cities hold "gallery hops" and "art walks", in which a number of the town's [[art gallery|art galleries]], museums, or artists' studios, both commercial and [[non-profit]] [[501c3]] organizations, will open their doors on Friday evening. The idea is that galleries will attract people to the downtown and enrich the art community by pooling their openings together, sometimes, as in the case of [[art6]] and [[Artspace in Richmond, Virginia]] (when in [[Jackson Ward]] at 6 East Broad Street) into one monthly evening in a historically-located designated [[arts district]] .

Among the cities with art-oriented First Friday events are: [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], [[Boston]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Fridays {{!}} icaboston.org|url=https://www.icaboston.org/calendar/first-fridays|website=www.icaboston.org|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]],&lt;ref&gt;http://denverartwalk.squarespace.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First First Friday, 2016|url=http://www.westword.com/event/first-first-friday-2016-7461289|website=Westword|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2017's First Friday means new art|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/story/entertainment/arts/2017/01/05/2017s-first-friday-means-new-art/96157550/|accessdate=6 January 2017|work=Knoxville News Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Jay|title=Turn your 2017 New Year wishes into art at First Friday Las Vegas|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/la-tr-las-vegas-first-friday-20170102-story.html|website=latimes.com|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miami]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saati|first1=Briana|title=First Friday Art Walk Guide: All the Culture on Display at Downtown's Inaugural Event|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/first-friday-art-walk-guide-all-the-culture-on-display-at-downtowns-inaugural-event-6499202|website=Miami New Times|accessdate=6 January 2017|date=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Missoula, Montana|Missoula]], [[Peoria (Illinois)]], [[Scranton]], [[Art Murmur|Oakland]], [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What To Do For First Friday In Philly This January|url=http://www.uwishunu.com/2017/01/celebrate-first-friday-philly-january-6/#sm.000nnbzwxvrrcxq114e2340gzulvn|website=Uwishunu - Philadelphia Blog About Things to Do, Events, Restaurants, Food, Nightlife and More|accessdate=6 January 2017|date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Friday {{!}} Artspace|url=http://artspacenc.org/events/first-friday/|website=artspacenc.org|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Galleries on First Fridays in Richmond, VA|url=https://www.visitrichmondva.com/things-to-do/arts-culture/galleries-first-fridays/|website=www.visitrichmondva.com|accessdate=6 January 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]], [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], [[Tulsa]], [[York, Pennsylvania|York (PA)]], and [[Ypsilanti]].

[[Richmond, Virginia]] is among the largest First Fridays art walks in the nation. It draws nearly 20,000 people from all over the state of Virginia and nation, showcasing its artistic side and opening restaurants and art galleries all over [[Broad Street (Richmond, Virginia)|Broad Street]], [[Manchester, Virginia|Manchester area]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Galleries on First Fridays in Richmond, VA|url=https://www.visitrichmondva.com/things-to-do/arts-culture/galleries-first-fridays/|website=www.visitrichmondva.com|accessdate=7 October 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Downtown Richmond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bass|first1=Scott|title=Broad Street Revivalists:The galleries and businesses of First Fridays Art Walk are the 2009 Richmonders of the Year|url=http://www.styleweekly.com/richmond/broad-street-revivalists/Content?oid=1367342|accessdate=7 January 2016|issue=January 06, 2010|publisher=Style Weekly|date=January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richmond.com/entertainment/collection_2cfb6e12-9e7a-11e2-8b91-0019bb30f31a.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artspace]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frostick|first1=Dana|title=artspacegallery.org|url=http://www.artspacegallery.org/outreach.htm|website=www.artspacegallery.org|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Art6|Art6 Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists Collect, Too, II Art6 Gallery Richmond|url=http://1995-2015.undo.net/it/mostra/18322|website=1995-2015.undo.net|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; were two of the first anchor galleries for First Fridays on Broad Street in Richmond.

One of the oldest First Friday's is located in Boston's [[SoWa|SoWa Arts District]] where more than 80 artists open their studios to the public every First Friday. The [[SoWa]] Arts District is located at Harrison Ave and Thayer Street in Boston's South End.  In 2015, [http://www.10best.com/awards/travel/best-art-district/ USA Today's 10BEST] readers poll voted the [[SoWa]] as the second best arts district in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.10best.com/awards/travel/best-art-district/|title=Best Art District Winners: 2015 10Best Readers' Choice Travel Awards|website=10Best|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social networking==
Some First Fridays promote arts and culture combined with social networking, like [http://www.typfirstfridays.com First Fridays] in [[Tucson, AZ]]. Other smaller-scale First Fridays serve as social gatherings for groups of friends or people new to an area and may involve no art.

They may also include the large First Friday events such as those in Phoenix, Arizona attracting up to 20,000 attendees to hundreds of spaces.

Various cities areas have First Fridays centered on politically conservative networking.  The pioneer of these events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zak|first=Dan|title=Off the clock and it's still party time on Capitol Hill with dueling happy hours|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/off-the-clock-and-its-still-party-time-on-capitol-hill-with-dueling-happy-hours/2011/06/03/AGkg4lJH_story.html|accessdate=May 31, 2014|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=Jun 5, 2011|agency=Washington Post|location=[[Washington, DC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; began in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = It's First Friday |url = http://www.itsfirstfriday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but similar events have found success in Virginia, Nevada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = First Friday Nevada |url = http://www.firstfridaynevada.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arizona.

In many cities, First Fridays events place an emphasis on [[African American]] [[social network|networking]] and business opportunities for [[African American]] professionals. First Friday is the top networking event for African American professionals and consistently attracts over 16,000 people each month across North America according to First Fridays United.

The First Fridays monthly events originated in 1987 as an outlet for African American professionals to mix, mingle and network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrne|first=Dara|title=Public Discourse, Community Concerns, and Civic Engagement:  Exploring Black Social Networking Traditions on BlackPlanet.com|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date=Dec 17, 2007|volume=13|issue=1|pages=319–320|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00398x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00398.x/pdf|accessdate=May 31, 2014|publisher=Wiley Online|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Adam|title=Why is First Fridays the best African American event in Nashville?|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/why-is-first-fridays-the-best-african-american-event-in-nashville/Content?oid=1188684|accessdate=May 31, 2014|newspaper=Nashville Scene|date=Jul 17, 2003|agency=Nashville Scene|location=[[Nashville, Tennessee]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1980s it was common for an individual to be the only black professional working in their company.  First Fridays happy hours become a way for these professionals to meet in a social atmosphere while exchanging useful information.  The concept spread rapidly and First Fridays chapters now operate in 39 cities across North America and seven countries worldwide, including [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]], [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi|Hattiesburg]], [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] [[London, England|London]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[New York City, New York|New York]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], Phoenix, [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[St Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Normandy, France|Normandy]], [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], [[Tokyo, Japan|Tokyo]], [[Toronto]], and Washington, D.C.

In 2002, several First Fridays operators created First Fridays United, which is a company founded to organize the existing First Fridays chapters in 30 cities into one group to share information, resources and solicit corporate sponsors and advertisers.  The organization sponsors a series of international events in addition to the monthly networking happy hours. Today, First Fridays reaches over 450,000 urban professionals through email, internet, and event marketing and has had numerous Fortune 1000 corporate clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = First Friday United: About Us |url = http://www.firstfridaysunited.com/aboutUs.php |accessdate = 27 February 2011 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110203071224/http://firstfridaysunited.com/aboutUs.php |archivedate = Feb 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHAT IS FIRST FRIDAYS UNITED?|url=http://www.experts123.com/q/what-is-first-fridays-united.html|website=www.experts123.com|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | footer = Both in this celestial coordinate system, and in the system to describe a nucleophile approaching a planar electrophile, the problem is to uniquely describe the location of a point off of a plane, relative to specific point on the plane (here '''plane I''', the plane containing the [[carbonyl]] and its '''R''' and '''R'''' substituents, likewise with other electrophiles). ''Hence, in both cases, the problem can be addressed using two angles, an altitude-type angle and an azimuth-type angle.'' (A third component of description is [[stereochemistry|stereochemical]], i.e., indicating whether approach is from above or below the electrophile plane, see following.)

The nucelophile (atom or group) is represented here as ''':Nu'''. The substituents,  '''R''' and '''R'''', attached to the carbon atom of the [[carbonyl]] group may be an atom such as hydrogen (H), [[alkyl group]]s such as [[methyl]], [[Ethyl group|ethyl]], etc. (including far more complex ones), or other [[functional group]]s such as the O- and N-containing groups of [[ester]]s and [[amide]]s. In both panels, a second plane, '''plane II''' (red), is defined that is [[orthogonal]] (perpendicular) to the first, con-taining the carbon and oxygen atoms of the [[carbonyl]], C=O, and [[bisection|bisecting]] the '''R&lt;big&gt;—•—&lt;/big&gt;R'''' angle (where the "•" is the carbon atom). A third plane, mutually orthogonal to the first two, '''plane III''' (green), contains only the carbon atom of the carbonyl; it corresponds to the plane of the page in the Newman projection at right. In that projection, the '''vector''' (arrow) pointing from :Nu to the carbon of the carbonyl is mirrored across plane I to make clear that the nucleophile can approach from either above or below this plane (with resulting differences in the stereochemistry of reaction products, see text). The dotted line from :Nu to plane I indicates the computational process of [[Projection (mathematics)|mathematically projecting]] the geometric point representing :Nu onto plane I, which is sometimes a necessary maths operation (see text).

Note, for sake of clarity of presentation in the image at left, the nucleophile and azimuthal angle, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt;, are shown as displaced toward the R substiuent, while in the Newman projection, the opposite is the case. In this article, the R substituent is arbitrarily being assigned to the more [[steric bulk|sterically bulky]] group, and so the displacement shown at right is most representative of the phenomena described throughout. Note also, while elevation in celestial applications is most easily measured as the specific altitude shown, the elevation of the nucleophile, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt;, is most easily measured as the [[Angle#Combining angle pairs|supplementary]] angle, Nu-C-O, hence its values are most often &gt;90° (see text).

The '''Flippin–Lodge angle''' is one of two angles used by [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[biochemistry|biological chemist]]s studying the relationship between a molecule's [[chemical structure]] and ways that it [[chemical reactivity|reacts]], for reactions involving "attack" of an electron-rich reacting species, the [[nucleophile]], on an electron-poor reacting species, the [[electrophile]]. Specifically, the angles—the [[Bürgi–Dunitz angle|Bürgi–Dunitz]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt;, and the Flippin–Lodge, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt;—describe the "trajectory" or "angle of attack" of the nucleophile as it approaches the electrophile, in particular when the latter is [[Trigonal planar molecular geometry|planar]] in shape. This is called a [[nucleophilic addition]] reaction and it plays a central role in the [[biochemistry|biological chemistry]] taking place in many [[biosynthesis|biosyntheses]] in nature, and is a central "tool" in the reaction toolkit of modern organic chemistry, e.g., to construct new molecules such as [[pharmaceuticals]]. Theory and use of these angles falls into the areas of [[synthetic chemistry|synthetic]] and [[physical organic chemistry]], which deals with [[chemical structure]] and [[reaction mechanism]], and within a sub-specialty called ''structure correlation''.

Because chemical reactions take place in [[three dimensional|three dimensions]], their quantitative description is, in part, a [[Euclidean geometry|geometry]] problem. Two angles, first the Bürgi–Dunitz angle, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt;, and later the Flippin–Lodge angle, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt;, were developed to describe the approach of the reactive [[atom]] of a nucleophile (a point off of a plane) to the reactive atom of an electrophile (a point on a plane). The &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; is an angle that estimates the displacement of the nucleophile, at its elevation, toward or away from the particular R and R' [[substituent]]s attached to the electrophilic atom (see image). The &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the approach vector connecting these two atoms and the plane containing the electrophile (see the [[Bürgi–Dunitz angle|Bürgi–Dunitz]] article). Reactions addressed using these angle concepts use nucleophiles ranging from single atoms (e.g., chloride [[anion]], [[chloride|Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]]) and polar organic [[functional group]]s (e.g., [[primary amine]]s, R"-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), to complex [[chiral catalyst]] reaction systems and [[enzyme]] [[active site]]s. These nucleophiles can be paired with an array of planar electrophiles: [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s, [[Carboxylic Acid Derivatives#Carbonyl compounds|carboxylic acid-derivatives]], and the carbon-carbon double bonds of [[alkene]]s. Studies of &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; can be theoretical, based on [[Molecular orbital|calculations]], or experimental (either quantitative, based on [[X-ray crystallography]], or inferred and semiquantitative, rationalizing results of particular chemical reactions), or a combination of these.

The most prominent application and impact of the Flippin–Lodge angle has been in the area of chemistry where it was originally defined: in practical [[organic synthesis|synthetic]] studies of the outcome of carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions in solution.  An important example is the [[aldol reaction]], e.g., addition of ketone-derived nucleophiles ([[enol]]s, [[enolate]]s), to electrophilic [[aldehyde]]s that have attached groups varying in size and polarity. Of particular interest, given the [[three-dimensional]] nature of the concept, is understanding how the combined features on the nucleophile and electrophile impact the [[stereochemistry]] of reaction outcomes (i.e., the "handedness" of new  [[chiral]] centers created by a reaction). Studies invoking Flippin–Lodge angles in synthetic chemistry have improved the ability of chemists to predict outcomes of known reactions, and to design better reactions to produce particular stereoisomers ([[enantiomer]]s and [[diastereomer]]s) needed in the construction of complex natural products and drugs.

==Technical introduction==
The Flippin–Lodge (FL) angle, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; is the latter-derived of two angles that fully define the geometry of "attack" (approach via collision) of a [[nucleophile]] on a [[trigonal]] [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] center of an [[electrophile|electrophilic]] [[molecule]] (the second being the Bürgi–Dunitz angle, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt;, see below).&lt;ref name=Fleming2010&gt;Ian Fleming (2010) Molecular Orbitals and Organic Chemical Reactions: Student Edition, John Wiley and Sons, pp. 158-160; see also Ian Fleming (2010) Molecular Orbitals and Organic Chemical Reactions: Reference Edition, John Wiley and Sons, pp.&amp;nbsp;214–215, {{ISBN|0470746580}}, [https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Orbitals-Organic-Chemical-Reactions/dp/0470746599], accessed 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt; Theory and application of these angles falls into the area of [[synthetic chemistry|synthetic]], and of [[physical organic chemistry]] (in the specializations of [[chemical structure]] and [[reaction mechanism]]), in the latter, within a sub-specialty called ''structure correlation''.&lt;ref name = Cieplak08&gt;{{cite book | authors = Cieplak, A.S. | year = 2008 | orig-year = 1994 | chapter = Organic Addition and Elimination Reactions; Transformation Paths of Carbonyl Derivatives [Ch. 6] | title =  Structure Correlation, Vol. 1 | pages = 205-302, esp. 270-274 | editors = Bürgi, Hans-Beat &amp; Dunitz, Jack D. | location = Weinheim, GER | publisher = VCH | isbn = 352761608X | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=352761608X | access-date = 1 March 2016 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of  &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt; can be theoretical, based on [[Molecular orbital|calculations]], or experimental (either quantitative, based on [[X-ray crystallography]], or inferred and semiquantitative, rationalizing results of particular chemical reactions), or a combination of these.&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt;&lt;ref name = Cieplak08/&gt;

Nucleophiles in this [[addition reaction]] may range from single atoms ([[hydride]], [[chloride]]), to polar organic [[functional group]]s ([[amine]]s, [[alcohol]]s), to complex systems (nucleophilic [[enolate]]s with [[chiral catalyst]]s, [[amino acid]] [[side chain]]s in [[enzyme]] [[active site]]s; see below). Planar electrophiles include [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s, [[carboxylic acid]]-derivatives such as [[ester]]s, and [[amide]]s, and the carbon-carbon double bonds of particular [[alkene]]s ([[olefin]]s).&lt;ref name=Heathcock1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt; In the example of nucleophilic attack at a carbonyl, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the "offset" of the nucleophile's approach to the electrophile, toward one or the other of the two substituents attached to the carbonyl carbon.&lt;ref name=Heathcock1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt; The relative values of angles for pairs of reactions can be inferred and semiquantitative, based on rationalizations of the products of the reactions; alternatively, as noted in the figure, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; values may be formally derived from crystallographic coordinates by geometric calculations, or graphically, e.g., after projection of Nu onto the carbonyl plane and measuring the angle supplementary to  ''L''Nu'-C-O (where Nu' is the projected atom).

The symbols &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt; are used here, respectively, to refer to the Flippin-Lodge and Bürgi-Dunitz concepts and measured values.

== Angle as experimental observable ==
These angles are best construed to mean the angles observed (measured) for a given system, and ''not'' an historically observed range in values (e.g., as in the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt; range of the original Bürgi–Dunitz aminoketones), or an idealized value computed for a particular system (such as the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; = 0° for hydride addition to formaldehyde).&lt;ref name=BurgiDunitzTet74/&gt; That is, the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; angles of the hydride-formadehyde system have one pair of values, while the angles observed for other systems—combinations of nucelophile and electrophile, in combination with catalyst and other variables that define the experimental condition, including whether the reaction is ''in solutio'' or otherwise—are fully ''expected'' (and are reported) to vary, at least somewhat, from the theoretical, symmetric hydride-formaldehyde case.&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=RadiskyKoshland2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=RadKoshExplanNote/&gt;

A stated ''convention for &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt;'' is that it is ''positive (&gt;0°) when it deviates in direction:''
* ''away from the larger substituent'' attached to the electrophilic center, &lt;u&gt;''or''&lt;/u&gt;
* ''away from the more electron-rich substituent'' (where these two and other factors can be in a complex competition, see below); 
hence, as noted, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; for reaction of a simple nucleophile with a symmetrically substituted carbonyl (R = R', or other symmetric planar electrophile) is expected to be 0° ''in vacuo'' or ''in solutio'', e.g., as in the case of the computed and experimental addition of hydride (H&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) to formaldehyde (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=O).&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;

In contrast to the Bürgi–Dunitz angle, [[Bürgi–Dunitz angle|&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt;]],&lt;ref name=BurgiDunitzTet74/&gt; and using the case of carbonyl additions as example: the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; angle adopted during an approach by the nucleophile to a trigonal electrophile depends in complex fashion on:
* the relative steric size of the two substituents attached to (alpha to) the electrophilic carbonyl, which give rise to varying degrees of repulsive van der Waals's interactions (e.g., giving &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 7° for [[hydride]] attack on [[pivaldehyde]] (see image), where R=''tertiary''-butyl, and R'=H),&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;
* the electronic characteristics of substituents alpha to the carbonyl, where heteroatom-containing substituents can, through their [[stereoelectronic]] influence, function as overly intrusive steric groups (e.g., giving &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 40-50° for esters and amides with small R' groups, since R is an O- and N-substituent, respectively),&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt; and
* the nature of the bonds made by more distant atoms to the atoms alpha to the carbonyl, e.g., where the energy of the σ* molecular orbital (MO) between the alpha- and beta-substituents was seen to compete with the foregoing influences,&lt;ref name=LodgeHeathcock1987/&gt;
as well as on the MO shapes and occupancies of the carbonyl and attacking nucleophile.&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt; Hence, the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt; observed for nucleophilic attack appears to be influenced primarily by the energetics of the HOMO-LUMO overlap of the nucleophile-electrophile pair in the systems studied—see the [[Bürgi–Dunitz angle|Bürgi–Dunitz]] article, and the related inorganic chemistry concept of the angular overlap model (AOM)&lt;ref&gt;While the AOM is almost uniformly applied to inorganic cases, per [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] definition it applies to main group elements as well, see Minkin, op. cit., and this extension is explicitly covered in the text and other writings of the late Prof. Jeremy Burdett, et. op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Minkin, V.

==Origin and current scope of concept==
Bürgi–Dunitz angle theory was initially developed based on "frozen" interactions in crystals,&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt;{{rp|124ff}}&lt;ref name=BurgiDunitzTet74/&gt; while most chemistry takes place via collisions of molecules tumbling in solution; remarkably, the theories of the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt;, with the complexity they reflect, evolved not from crystallographic work, but from studying reaction outcomes in such practical reactions as addition of [[enolate]]s to aldehydes (e.g., in study of diastereoselection in particular [[aldol]] reactions).&lt;ref name=Heathcock1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt; In applying both angles of the nucleophile trajectory to real chemical reactions, the HOMO-LUMO centered view of the Bürgi-Dunitz angle, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{DB}&lt;/math&gt;, is modified to include further complex, electrophile-specific attractive and repulsive  [[electrostatic]] and [[van der Waals interaction]]s that can alter &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{DB}&lt;/math&gt; and bias &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; toward one substituent or the other (see above).&lt;ref name=LodgeHeathcock1987/&gt; As well, dynamics are at play in each system (e.g., changing [[torsional angle]]s) and are implicitly included in studies of reaction outcomes in solution, as in the early studies of &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=LodgeHeathcock1987/&gt;—though not in crystallographic structure correlation approaches as gave birth to the BD concept.

Finally, in constrained environments (e.g., in [[enzyme]] and [[nanomaterial]] binding sites), these angles, when characterized, appear to be quite distinct, an observation conjectured to arise because reactivity is not based on random collision, and so the relationship between orbital overlap principles and reactivity is more complex.&lt;ref name=RadiskyKoshland2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=RadKoshExplanNote/&gt;&lt;ref name=LightEtal14&gt;S.H.

The Flippin-Lodge and Bürgi-Dunitz angles were central, practically, to the development of a clearer understanding of [[asymmetric induction]] during nucleophilic attack at hindered carbonyl centers in synthetic organic chemistry. It was in this area that &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; was first defined by Heathcock, and has been primarily used.&lt;ref name=Heathcock1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt; Larger substituents around the electrophilic center, such as tert-butyls, lead to higher stereoselectivities in asymmetric induction than smaller substituents like methyls. The trajectory of the nucleophile approaching a center flanked by two large substituents is more limited, i.e. the Flippin–Lodge angle is smaller. For example, in [[Mukaiyama aldol addition]], the bulkier phenyl tert-butyl ketone has a higher selectivity for the ''syn'' isomer than the smaller phenyl methyl ketone. Likewise, if bulky a nucleophile, such as a t-butylmethylsilyl enolate, is used, the selectivity is higher than for a small nucleophile like a lithium enolate.&lt;ref name="Flippin1983"/&gt;

Given a reaction system of a given nucleophile with a carbonyl having the two substituents R and R', where substituent R' is [[steric]]ally small relative to substituent R (e.g., R' = hydrogen atom, R = phenyl), the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; values that are inferred from the reaction outcomes and theoretical studies tend to be larger;{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} alternatively, if the hydrocarbon substituents are nearer or equal in [[steric]] size, the inferred &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt;values diminish and may approach zero (e.g., R' = ''tert''-butyl, R = phenyl).{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Thus, from the perspective of simpler electrophile systems where only steric bulk come into play, the attack trajectories of the classes of nucleophiles studied makes clear that as the disparity in size between the substituent increase, there is a perturbation in the FL angle that can be used to provide higher stereoselectivities in designed reaction systems;{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} while the patterns become more complex when factors other than steric bulk come into play (see section above on orbital contributions),&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=LodgeHeathcock1987/&gt; Flippin, Lodge, and Heathcock were able to show that generalizations could be made that were useful to reaction design.&lt;ref name=Heathcock1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt;

The '''Hand of God''', or '''Manus Dei''' in Latin, also known as '''Dextera domini/dei''', the "[[right hand of God]]", is a motif in [[Jew]]ish and [[Christian art]], especially of the [[Late Antique]] and [[Early Medieval]] periods, when depiction of [[Jehovah]] or [[God the Father]] as a full human figure was considered unacceptable. The hand, sometimes including a portion of an arm, or ending about the wrist, is used to indicate the intervention in or approval of affairs on Earth by God, and sometimes as a subject in itself. It is an artistic metaphor that is generally not intended to indicate that a hand was physically present or seen at any subject depicted. The Hand is seen appearing from above in a fairly restricted number of narrative contexts, often in a [[blessing]] gesture (in Christian examples), but sometimes performing an action. In later Christian works it tends to be replaced by a [[God the Father in Western art|fully realized figure of God the Father]], whose depiction had become acceptable in [[Western Christianity]], although not in [[Eastern Orthodox]] or Jewish art.&lt;ref name="JVL Anthropomorphism"&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0002_0_01141.html "Anthropomorphism"], Jewish Virtual Library, especially the section on Jewish art near the end.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the hand of God has traditionally been understood as a symbol for God's intervention or approval of human affairs, it is also possible that the hand of God reflects the anthropomorphic conceptions of the deity that may have persisted in late antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Bar Ilan, 321–35; Roth, 191; C. W. Griffith and David Paulsen, 97–118; Jensen, 120–21; Paulsen, 105–16; Jill Joshowitz, ''The Hand of God:The Anthropomorphic God of Late Antique Judaism: Archaeological and Textual Perspectives'', (B.A. thesis, Yeshiva University, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The largest group of Jewish imagery from the ancient world, the 3rd century [[Dura-Europos synagogue|synagogue at Dura-Europas]], has the hand of God in five different scenes, including the ''Sacrifice of Isaac'',&lt;ref&gt;Hachili, pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; and no doubt this was one of the many iconographic features taken over by Christian art from what seems to have been a vigorous tradition of Jewish narrative art. Here and elsewhere it often represents the ''[[bath Kol]]'' (literally "daughter of a voice") or voice of God,&lt;ref&gt;A matter disputed by some scholars&lt;/ref&gt; a use also taken over into Christian art.

The hand may also relate to older traditions in various other religions in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Summarized by Hachili, 145&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Amarna art|art of the Amarna period]] in Egypt under [[Akhenaten]], the rays of the [[Aten]] sun-disk end in small hands to suggest the bounty of the supreme deity. Like the [[hamsa]] [[amulet]], the hand is sometimes shown alone on buildings, although it does not seem to have existed as a portable [[amulet]]-type object in Christian use. It is found from the 4th century on in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], including paintings of ''Moses receiving the Law'' and the ''Sacrifice of Isaac''.&lt;ref&gt;Hachili, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous references to the hand, or arm, of God in the [[Hebrew Bible]], most clearly metaphorical in the way that remains current in modern English, but some capable of a literal interpretation.&lt;ref name="JVL Anthropomorphism" /&gt; They are usually distinguished from references to a placement at the [[right hand of God]]. Later [[rabbinic literature]] also contains a number of references. There are three occasions in the gospels when the voice of God is heard, and the hand often represents this in visual art.&lt;ref&gt;"in Ravenna and in Western art from the ninth until the eleventh centuries" according to Schiller I, 149, although Western examples of the hand in depictions of these occasions extend well before and after these dates.&lt;/ref&gt; Gertrud Schiller distinguishes three functions of the hand in Christian art: as symbol of either God's presence or the voice of God, or signifying God's acceptance of a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II 674 (Index headings)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In sacred texts and commentary==
[[File:Abraham und Isaak.JPG|thumb|left|The Hand of God intervenes at the ''Sacrifice of Isaac'', [[Culture of Armenia|Armenian]], [[Akdamar Island|Akdamar]], 10th century]]

===Hebrew Bible===
The hand of God, which encompasses God's arm and fingers as well, is one of the most frequently employed anthropomorphisms of the Hebrew Bible. References to the hand of God occur numerous times in the Pentateuch alone, particularly in regards to the unfolding narrative of the Israelites' exodus from Egypt (cf. Exodus 3:19–20, Exodus 14: 3, 8, 31).&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of scholarship on anthropomorphism in biblical and rabbinic Judaism see Meir Bar Ilan, "The Hand of God: A Chapter in Rabbinic Anthropomorphism", in Rashi 1040–1990 ''Hommage a Ephraim'' E. Urbach ed. Gabrielle Sed Rajna. (1993): 321–35; Edmond Cherbonnier, "The Logic of Biblical Anthropomorphism", ''[[Harvard Theological Review]]'' 55.3 (1962): 187–206; Alon Goshen Gottstein, "The Body as Image of God In Rabbinic Literature", ''Harvard Theological Review'' 87.2 (1994): 171–95; Jacob Neusner, ''The Incarnation of God'' (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1988); Morton Smith, "On the Shape of God and Humanity of Gentiles", in ''Religion in Antiquity'' ed. Jacob Neusner (Leiden: Brill, 1968), 315–26; David Stern, "Imitatio Hominis: Anthropomorphism and the Character(s) of God in Rabbinic Literature", ''[[Prooftexts (journal)|Prooftexts]]'' 12.2 (1992): 151– 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
There are no references to the hand of God as an active agent or witness in the New Testament, though there are several to Jesus standing or sitting by the [[right hand of God]] in God's heavenly court,&lt;ref&gt;Mark 16:19, Luke 22:69, Matthew 22:44 and 26:64, Acts 2:34 and 7:55, 1 Peter 3:22&lt;/ref&gt; a conventional term for the place of honour beside a host or senior family member. For example, when Stephen is filled with the "holy spirit" he looks to heaven and sees Jesus standing by the right hand of God (Acts 7:55). There are three occasions in the [[Gospels]] when the voice of God is heard, and the hand of God often represents this in visual art.&lt;ref&gt;"in Ravenna and in Western art from the ninth until the eleventh centuries" according to Schiller I, 149, although Western examples of the hand in depictions of these occasions extend well before and after these dates.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rabbinic literature===
[[Anthropomorphic]] [[aggadot]] regarding the hand of God appear frequently in the corpus of rabbinic literature and expand upon anthropomorphic biblical narratives.

==Christian art==
[[File:Apsis mosaic San Clemente n2.jpg|thumb|right|Clothed hand clutching wreath, [[San Clemente, Rome]], 1140–43.]]
In Christian art, the hand of God has traditionally been understood as an artistic metaphor that is not intended to indicate that the deity was physically present or seen in any subject depicted. In the late antique and early medieval periods, the representation of the full-bodied figure of God the Father would have been considered a grave violation of the Second Commandment.&lt;ref&gt;Linda and Peter Murray, "Trinity", in ''The Oxford Companion to Christian Art and Architecture'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), 544.&lt;/ref&gt; According to conventional art historical interpretation, the representation of the hand of God in early Christian art thus developed as a necessary and symbolic compromise to the highly anti-anthropomorphic tenor of the Second Commandment, though anthropomorphic interpretations are certainly plausible.&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Griffith and David Paulsen, "Augustine and the Corporeality of God", ''[[Harvard Theological Review]]'' 95.1 (2002): 97–118; Robin Jensen, Face to Face: Portraits of the Divine in Early Christianity (Minneapolis: Fortress, 2005), 120–21; David Paulsen, "Early Christian Belief in a Corporeal Deity: Origen and Augustine as Reluctant Witnesses", Harvard Theological Review, 83.2 (1990): 105–16.&lt;/ref&gt; In early Christian and Byzantine art, the hand of God is seen appearing from above in a fairly restricted number of narrative contexts, often in a [[blessing]] gesture, but sometimes performing an action. Gertrud Schiller distinguishes three functions of the hand in Christian art: as symbol of either God's presence or the voice of God, or signifying God's acceptance of a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II 674 (Index headings)&lt;/ref&gt; In later Christian works it tends to be replaced by a [[God the Father in Western art|fully realized figure of God the Father]], whose depiction had become acceptable in [[Western Christianity]], although not in [[Eastern Orthodox]] or Jewish art.&lt;ref name="JVL Anthropomorphism" /&gt;

===Iconography===
The motif of the hand, with no body attached, provides a problem for the artist in how to terminate it. In Christian narrative images the hand most often emerges from a small cloud, at or near the top of the image, but in iconic contexts it may appear cut off in the picture space, or spring from a border, or a victor's [[wreath]] (left). A cloud is mentioned as the source of the voice of God in the gospel accounts of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] (see below). Several of the examples in the [[Dura Europos synagogue]] (see below) show a good part of the forearm as well as the hand, which is not found in surviving Christian examples, and most show an open palm, sometimes with the fingers spread out. Later examples in Jewish art are closer in form to Christian styles.

In Christian art, the hand of God usually occupies the form of a blessing gesture, if they are not performing an action, though some just show an open hand. The normal blessing gesture is to point with the index and next finger, with the other fingers curled back and thumb relaxed. There is also a more complicated Byzantine gesture that attempts to represent the Greek letter ''[[Chi (letter)|chi]]'', [[Christ]]'s initial, which looks like a Latin letter "X". This is formed by crossing the thumb and little finger inside the palm, with only the forefinger and next one extended,&lt;ref&gt;Didron, I, 201–3&lt;/ref&gt; or a variant of this.

Especially in Roman mosaics, but also in some German imperial commissions, for example on the [[Lothair Cross]], the hand is clenched around a wreath that goes upwards, and behind which the arm then disappears, forming a tidy circular motif. Especially in these examples, the hand may show the sleeve of a garment, sometimes of two layers, as at [[San Clemente, Rome]]. In blessing forms the hand often has a [[Halo (art)|halo]], which also may provide a convenient termination point. This may or may not be a cruciform halo, indicating the divinity, and specifically the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], or [[Pre-existing Christ]] (see below).
[[File:San Pedro de la Nave capitel.JPG|thumb|left|[[Visigoth]]ic capital with the ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac]]''.]]

The hand is regularly seen in depictions of certain scenes, though it may occur on occasion in a much wider range.&lt;ref&gt;See index of Schiller II under "Hand of God"&lt;/ref&gt; In many scenes one or more angels, acting as the messengers of God, may appear instead of the hand. A virtually unique mosaic depiction of the ''[[Ark of the Covenant]]'' (806) at [[Germigny-des-Prés]], also features the hand of God.

In Christian art the hand will often actually represent the hand of [[God the Son]], or the Logos; this is demonstrated when later depictions start to substitute for the Hand a small half-length portrait of Christ as Logos in a similar circular frame. It is nearly always Christ in the East, but in the West God the Father will sometimes be shown in this way. However, in many contexts the person of the Trinity intended cannot be confirmed from the image alone, except in those images, like the ''[[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]'', where Jesus the [[Incarnate Christ]] is also present, where the hand is clearly that of God the Father. Later [[Eastern Orthodox]] images often identify Hands as the Logos with the usual monogram used in [[icon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example [[:File:St George - Pskov school.jpg|in this icon]], as compared to [[:File:Borisgleb riding.jpg|this one]], which shows the Hand replaced with a Christ/Logos.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Old Testament imagery====
*In the [[Vienna Genesis]] the hand appears above the ''Expulsion of [[Adam and Eve]] from [[Paradise]]''. More often, God was shown in this story using the conventional [[depiction of Jesus]] representing the pre-existent Christ or ''[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]'', who was seen as the Creator by Early Christian writers,&lt;ref&gt;The account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] naturally credits the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] to the single figure of God, in Christian terms, God the Father. However the first person plural in Genesis 1:26 "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness", and New Testament references to Christ as creator (John 1:3, Colossians 1:15) led Early Christian writers to associate the Creation with the [[Logos]].&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Adam and Eve was the Old Testament subject most frequently seen in Christian art that needed a pictorial representation of God. A well known modern variant of the traditional hand motif is a sculpture of 1898 by [[Auguste Rodin]] called the ''Hand of God'', which shows a gigantic hand creating Adam and Eve.
*The [[Sacrifice of Isaac]] first appears in Christian art in 4th century depictions from the Roman catacombs and sarcophagi, as well as pieces like a fragment from a marble table from [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Weitzmann|Weitzmann, Kurt]], ed., ''[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15324coll10/id/156533 Age of spirituality : late antique and early Christian art, third to seventh century]'', no. 380, 1979, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York, {{ISBN|978-0-87099-179-0}}; full text available online from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham]] is restrained by the hand, which in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] grasped his knife hand, as the angel often does in other depictions.&lt;ref&gt;Though both hand and knife are now missing, with only a wrist stump now remaining.&lt;/ref&gt; However the angel mentioned in the biblical text is more usual, and often included as well. The use of the hand in this scene, at least in Christian art, indicates God's acceptance of the sacrifice, as well as his intervention to change it.
[[File:Paris psaulter gr139 fol422v.jpg|thumb|[[Moses]] receives the [[Tablets of the Law]], and hears the call of God. [[Paris Psalter]].]]
*Some depictions have the hand passing [[Moses]] the [[Tablets of the Law]], found in the Roman catacombs, various Bibles (see gallery), the [[Paris Psalter]], and in mosaic in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref&gt;Noga-Banai, Galit. ''The Trophies of the Martyrs: An Art Historical Study of Early Christian Silver Reliquaries'', Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-19-921774-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-921774-8}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BUyGDWSsi4sC&amp;pg=PT37&amp;dq=Dura-Europos+Moses+receiving+the+law#v=onepage&amp;q=Dura-Europos%20Moses%20receiving%20the%20law&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The prophet [[Ezekiel]] (2:9–10) received his prophecy by hand: "Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll, which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+2&amp;version=NIV Ezekiel Ch. 2], NIV&lt;/ref&gt; and this and other moments from Ezekiel sometimes include the hand. In the [[Paris Psalter]], Moses, [[Jonah]] and [[Isaiah]] are all shown blessed by hands, from which rays of light come. Other prophets are sometimes also shown with the hand.
*In the [[Klosterneuburg]] Altar, [[Drogo Sacramentary]] (shown below) and San Vitale, Ravenna, [[Melchizedek]] is shown blessed by it, in the last combined with [[Abel]]. This relates to the approval of his sacrifice mentioned in the biblical text, and possibly also to the hand's association with divinely ordained monarchy (see below), as Melchizedek was both priest and king according to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:18–20, and his appearance in art is often to evoke this as well as his function as a [[typology (theology)|type]] for Christ.
*The hand can appear in other contexts; the Carolingian [[Utrecht Psalter]] atypically illustrates nearly all the [[Psalms]], probably following an Antique model, and shows the hand in at least 27 of these images, despite also using a figure of Christ-as-God in the heavens even more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psalter.library.uu.nl/default.asp Utrecht Psalter online] – for hands see Psalms 2,5,14,21–23,26,29,40,42,48,53–55,63,77,83,86,105,111,118,123–125,132,136–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A mosaic in the [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] in Ravenna shows the battle of [[Beth-horon]] with the [[Amorites]] ([[Joshua]], 10:11), where: "As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the LORD hurled large hailstones down on them from the sky, and more of them died from the hailstones than were killed by the swords of the Israelites" – with a large hand representing God.
*The story in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 5:1–31 of [[the writing on the wall]] is rarely depicted until the 17th century, when [[Belshazzar's Feast (Rembrandt)|Rembrandt's well known version]] and others were produced.

*In depictions of the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'', the hand often appears at the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]] representing the voice of God, above the [[dove]] representing the [[Holy Spirit]], which is much more common, thus showing the whole [[Trinity]] as present and active.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, 115 &amp; Schiller, I pp. 134 &amp; 137–9&lt;/ref&gt; The hand never seems to appear without the dove, as the Holy Spirit as a dove is mentioned in the Gospel of Mark: "As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."&lt;ref&gt;Mark 3:16–17 NIV; all three [[Synoptic Gospels]] have the voice.&lt;/ref&gt; Both dove and hand are normally located centrally, pointing straight down at Jesus. The hand is mostly found in ''Baptism''s between the 6th (e.g. [[Rabbula Gospels]]) and 11th centuries.
*The hand is found in some Western and later Armenian scenes of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]],&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I pp. 148–151. See also [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=riNIXZzr_NcC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=%22hand+of+God%22+iconography&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hand%20of%20God%22%20iconography&amp;f=false Mathews, p. 96]&lt;/ref&gt; where again the [[Synoptic Gospels]] have the voice of God speaking, this time from a cloud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/matthew/3-17.htm Bible texts and commentaries]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The hand is sometimes seen in the [[Agony in the Garden]], though an angel is more common. This is the third and final occasion when the voice of God is mentioned in the gospels, this time only in the [[Gospel of John]] (12:28). The earliest known example is in the [[St Augustine Gospels]] of c.600.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II, 49&lt;/ref&gt;
*From [[Carolingian art]] until the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]], the hand may appear above the top of the cross in the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], pointing straight down. Sometimes it holds a wreath over Christ's head, as on the rear of the [[Ottonian art|Ottonian]] [[Lothair Cross]] at [[Aachen Cathedral]]. The hand represents divine approval, and specifically acceptance of his sacrifice,&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II, 107–108 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly also the storm mentioned in the gospels.
*The hand may be seen in the [[Ascension of Christ]], sometimes, as in the [[Drogo Sacramentary]], reaching down and clasping that of Christ, as though to pull him up into the clouds. The ivory plaque now in [[Munich]] (left) with such a depiction is possibly the earliest [[Ascension of Jesus in Christian art|representation of the Ascension]] to survive. 
*In [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s of the [[Last Judgement]], the hand often holds the scales in which souls are weighed (in the West [[Saint Michael]] typically does this). The hand may emerge from the [[Hetoimasia]] usually present, and is typically huge in size compared to the full figures nearby in the composition.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Divine approval of rulers imagery====
[[File:Main Justice Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|The recreated "Hand of Justice" used in [[Napoleon]]'s coronation, [[Musée du Louvre]].]]
The hand often blesses rulers from above, especially in Carolingian and Ottonian works, and coins. The hand may hold a wreath or crown over the ruler's head, or place it on the head. A posthumous coin of [[Constantine the Great]] (the "deification issue") had shown the hand reaching down to pull up a veiled figure of Constantine in a [[quadriga]], in a famously mixed message that combined pagan conventions, where an [[eagle]] drew deified emperors up to the heavens, with Christian iconography. From the late 4th century coins of Late Antique rulers such as [[Arcadius]] (and his empress), [[Galla Placidia]] and others show them being crowned by it – it was in fact mostly used for empresses, and often only appears on issues from the Eastern Empire.&lt;ref&gt;''Catalogue of late Roman coins in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection and in the Whittemore Collection: from Arcadius and Honorius to the accession of Anastasius'', Philip Grierson, Melinda Mays, Dumbarton Oaks, 1992, {{ISBN|0-88402-193-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88402-193-3}}
[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sdCjnwoQLR0C&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=coin+crowned+by+%22hand+of+god%22&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google books] gives a full account of Late Antique usage. See also [http://www.davidrsear.com/academy/roman_glossary.html#Manus David Sear] coin glossary&lt;/ref&gt; This theme is not then seen in [[Byzantine art]] until the late 10th century, when it appears in coins of [[John I Tzimisces]] (969–976), long after it was common in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Zach Margulies, [http://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=christian%20themes%20in%20byzantine%20coinage "Christian Themes in Byzantine Coinage, 307 - 1204"]&lt;/ref&gt; In later Byzantine miniatures figures the hand is often replaced by a full figure of Christ (in these examples much smaller than the Emperor) placing a crown on the head.&lt;ref&gt;Examples [[:File:Basilios II.jpg|here]] and [[:File:Nicephorus III and Maria of Alania BnF Coislin79 fol2bis.jpg|here]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar symbolism was represented by the "Main de Justice" ("Hand of Justice"), part of the traditional [[French Crown Jewels#Sceptre of Charles V and Main de Justice|French Coronation Regalia]], which was a [[sceptre]] in the form of a short gold rod surmounted by an [[ivory]] hand in the blessing gesture. The object now in the [[Louvre]] is a recreation, made for Napoleon or a restored Bourbon king, of the original, which was destroyed in the [[French Revolution]], although the original ivory hand has survived (now displayed separately). [[Engraved gem]]s are used for an authentic medieval feel. Here the hand represents the justice-dispensing power of God as being literally in the hands of the king.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Saints imagery====
[[File:BambergGregoryUnkFolDedicationMin.jpg|thumb|[[Presentation miniature]] in a copy of [[St Gregory]]'s ''[[Moralia in Job]]'', 11th century.]]
The hand can also be shown with images of saints, either actioning a [[miracle]] associated with a saint – in Catholic theology it is God who performs all miracles – or above an iconic scene. In the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] the hand appears over [[Westminster Abbey]] in the scene showing the funeral of [[Edward the Confessor]]. The hand sometimes appears (see gallery) in scenes of the murder of [[martyr]]s like St [[Thomas Becket]], clearly indicating neither involvement nor approval of the deed, but approval of the saint. In the [[dedication miniature]] shown, the blessing hand seems pointed neither at [[Emperor Henry III]], nor [[St Gregory]] or the abbot, but at the copy of Gregory's book – the same copy that contains this miniature. This looser usage of the motif reaches its peak in Romanesque art, where it occasionally appears in all sorts of contexts – indicating the "right" speaker in a miniature of a [[disputation]], or as the only decoration at the top of a monastic [[charter]]. A number of Anglo-Saxon coins of [[Edward the Elder]] and [[Æthelred the Unready]] has a large hand dominating their reverse sides, although religious symbols were rarely so prominent on Anglo-Saxon coins.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 274 &amp; illustration on 269&lt;/ref&gt;

====Icons====
In [[Eastern Orthodox]] icons the hand remained in use far longer than in the Western church, and is still found in modern icons, normally emerging from circular bands. Apart from the narrative scenes mentioned above it is especially often found in icons of [[military saint]]s, and in some Russian icons is identified by the usual inscription as belonging to Jesus Christ. In other versions of the same composition a small figure of Christ of about the same size as the hand takes its place, which is also seen in many Western works from about 1000 onwards.
 
The earliest surviving [[icon]] of the [[Virgin Mary]], of about 600 from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], has an often overlooked hand, suggesting to Robin Cormack that the emphasis of the subject is on the [[Incarnation]] rather than a simple [[Virgin and Child]].&lt;ref&gt;See also the apse mosaic of the [[Euphrasian Basilica]], from about the 550s, which has a very similar composition.&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the very few major Eastern works showing the Virgin from before the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]], an apse mosaic (lost in 1922) from [[İznik|Nicaea]], also shows the hand above a standing Virgin. Few similar uses of the hand are seen in later Virgins, though the iconographically adventurous Byzantine [[Chludov Psalter]] (9th century) has a small miniature showing the hand and dove above a Virgin &amp; Child.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I, p. 7 &amp; fig. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The hand occasionally appears in Western ''[[Annunciation]]s'', even as late as [[Simone Martini]] in the 14th century, by which time the dove, sometimes accompanied by a small image of God the Father, has become more common.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I pp. 43,44,45,47, figs 82, 97, 108&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BMprintAN00343789 001 l.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Anonymous print on the situation of the Netherlands in the 1570s, with three hands]]

====Ravenna mosaics====
The hand appears at the top of a number of Late Antique [[apse]] mosaics in Rome and Ravenna, above a variety of compositions that feature either Christ or the cross,&lt;ref&gt;One previously at [[Santi Cosma e Damiano]] (for example, see Dodwell, p. 5), seems now to have been restored away. Others are in [[Santa Cecilia in Trastevere]], [[Santa Prassede]], and others illustrated here or on Commons.&lt;/ref&gt; some covered by the regular contexts mentioned above, but others not. The motif is then repeated in much later mosaics from the 12th century.

====Late Medieval and early Renaissance art====
From the 14th century, and earlier in some contexts, [[God the Father in Western art|full figures of God the Father]] became increasingly common in Western art, though still controversial and rare in the Orthodox world. Naturally such figures all have hands, which use the blessing and other gestures in a variety of ways. It may be noted that the most famous of all such uses, [[Michelangelo]]'s creating hand of God in the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], breaks clear of God's encircling robe above the wrist, and is shown against a plain background in a way reminiscent of many examples of the earlier motif.

The motif did not disappear in later iconography, and enjoyed a revival in the 15th century as the range of religious subjects greatly expanded and depiction of God the Father became controversial again among Protestants. The prints of [[Daniel Hopfer]] and others make frequent use of the hand in a variety of contexts, and the personal [[emblem]] of [[John Calvin]] was a heart held in the Hand. Very free use of the motif is made in prints relating to the religious and political fall-out of the Reformation over the next two centuries, in prints on the [[Dutch Revolt]] for example. In a high [[Rococo]] setting at the [[Windberg Abbey]], [[Lower Bavaria]], the Hand of God holds scales in which a lily stem indicating Saint Catherine's purity outweighs the crown and sceptre of worldly pomp.

The similar but essentially unrelated arm-reliquary was a popular form during the medieval period when the hand was most used. Typically these are in precious metal, showing the hand and most of the forearm, pointing up erect from a flat base where the arm stopped. They contained [[relic]]s, usually from that part of the body of the saint, and it was the saint's hand that was represented.

==Examples in late antique and medieval Jewish art==
[[File:Ezekiel 3.jpeg|thumb|Ezekiel in the Valley of Dry Bones cycle [[Dura Europos synagogue]]]]
The hand of God appears in several examples from the small surviving body of figurative Jewish religious art. It is especially prominent in the wall paintings of the third-century [[Dura Europos synagogue]], and also seen in the nave mosaic of the sixth century [[Beth Alpha]] synagogue, and on a sixth-seventh century [[Bema#Judaism|bimah]] screen found at the fourth-fifth century [[Susiya]] synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Roth, "Anthropomorphism, Jewish Art", in ''Encyclopedia Judaica'', ed. Fred Skolnik and Michael Berenbaum (Thomson Gale; Detroit : Macmillan Reference USA, 2007), 191 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Dura Europos synagogue===
In the Dura Europos synagogue, the hand of God appears ten times, in five out of the twenty-nine biblically themed wall paintings including the ''Binding of Isaac'', ''Moses and the Burning Bush'', ''Exodus and Crossing of the Red Sea'', ''Elijah Reviving the Child of the Widow of Zarepheth'', and ''Ezekiel in the Valley of Dry Bones''.&lt;ref&gt;Kraeling, 57&lt;/ref&gt;  In several examples the hand includes the forearm as well.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Beth Alpha synagogue===
[[File:Beit alfa02.jpg|thumbnail|right|Binding of Isaac mosaic, [[Beth Alpha]]]]
In the [[Beth Alpha]] synagogue, the hand of God appears on the ''Binding of Isaac'' panel on the northern entryway of the synagogue's nave mosaic floor.&lt;ref&gt;Eleazar Sukenik, ''The Synagogue at Beth Alpha'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The hand of God appearing in the Beth Alpha ''Binding of Isaac'' mosaic panel is depicted as a disembodied hand emerging from a fiery ball of smoke, "directing the drama and its outcome" according to [[Meyer Schapiro]].&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, 30&lt;/ref&gt; The hand of God is positioned strategically in the upper center of the composition, directly above the ram that the angel of God instructs Abraham to sacrifice in place of Isaac.

===Susiya synagogue===

In the [[Susiya]] synagogue, the hand of God appears on the defaced remains of a marble bimah screen that perhaps once illustrated a biblical scene such as ''Moses Receiving the Law'' or the ''Binding of Isaac''.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Werlin, "Khirbet Susiya" in ''The Late Ancient Synagogues of Southern Palestine'', (Ph.D. diss., University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, 2012): 525.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the hand was subjected to intense [[iconoclastic]] hacking, the iconoclasts left some vestiges of the thumb and the receding fingers intact.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Fine, "Iconoclasm: Who Defeated this Jewish Art", ''Bible Review'' (2000): 32-43; Robert Shick, "Iconoclasm", in ''The Christian Communities of Palestine from Byzantine to Islamic Rule: A Historical and Archaeological Study'' (Darwin Press Inc.: Princeton, N.J.), 213.&lt;/ref&gt; A thumbnail has been carved into the thumb. Foerster asserts that the hand of God originally held a Torah scroll, identifying the small piece of raised marble located between the thumb and fingers as a Torah scroll.&lt;ref&gt;Foerster, ''Decorated Marble Chancel Screens'', 1820.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Birdhea5.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Birds' Head Haggadah]]]]

===Birds' Head Haggadah===
{{main|Birds' Head Haggadah}}
The hand of God appears in the early 14th-century [[Haggadah]], the [[Birds' Head Haggadah]], produced in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;"Bird's Head Haggadah", Israel Museum Digital Catalogue, Israel Museum, Jerusalem http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/popup?c0=13475.&lt;/ref&gt; Two hands of God appear underneath the text of the ''[[Dayenu]]'' song, dispensing the [[manna]] from heaven. The Birds' Head Haggadah is a particularly important visual source from the medieval period, as it is the earliest surviving example of a medieval illuminated Hebrew Haggadah.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11302">'''In vitro spermatogenesis''' is the process of creating male [[gamete]]s ([[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]]) outside of the body in a culture system. The process could be useful for fertility preservation, infertility treatment and may further develop the understanding of [[spermatogenesis]] at the cellular and molecular level.  

Spermatogenesis is a highly complex process and artificially rebuilding it ''[[in vitro]]'' is challenging.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} These include creating a similar microenvironment to that of the testis as well as supporting endocrine and paracrine signalling, and ensuring survival of the somatic and germ cells from [[spermatogonial stem cell]]s (SSCs) to mature spermatozoa.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reuter|first=Karin|last2=Schlatt|first2=Stefan|last3=Ehmcke|first3=Jens|last4=Wistuba|first4=Joachim|date=2012-10-01|title=Fact or fiction:  In vitro spermatogenesis|journal=Spermatogenesis|volume=2|issue=4|pages=245–252|doi=10.4161/spmg.21983|issn=2156-5554|pmc=3521746|pmid=23248765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cell cultures can include either monocultures, where one cell population is cultured, or co-culturing systems, where several cells lines (must be at least two) can be cultured together.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galdon|first=Guillermo|last2=Atala|first2=Anthony|last3=Sadri-Ardekani|first3=Hooman|date=2016-04-23|title=In Vitro Spermatogenesis: How Far from Clinical Application?|journal=Current Urology Reports|language=en|volume=17|issue=7|pages=49|doi=10.1007/s11934-016-0605-3|pmid=27107595|issn=1527-2737}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells are initially isolated for culture by enzymatically digesting the testis tissue to separate out the different cells types for culture.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The process of isolating cells can lead to cell damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Damien|last2=Anand-Ivell|first2=Ravinder|last3=Danner|first3=Sandra|last4=Ivell|first4=Richard|date=2012-01-01|title=Models of in vitro spermatogenesis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341244/|journal=Spermatogenesis|volume=2|issue=1|pages=32–43|doi=10.4161/spmg.19383|issn=2156-5554|pmc=3341244|pmid=22553488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of monoculture is that the effect of different influences on one specific cell population of cells can be investigated.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Co-culture allows for the interactions between cell populations to be observed and experimented on, which is seen as an advantage over the monoculture model.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Isolated cell culture, specifically co-culture of testis tissue, has been a useful technique for examining the influences of specific factors such as hormones or different feeder cells on the progression of spermatogenesis ''in vitro''.{{Cit|date=October 2018}} For example, factors such as temperature, feeder cell influence and the role of [[testosterone]] and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) have all been investigated using isolated cell culture techniques.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Studies have concluded that different factors can influence the culture of germ cells e.g. media, growth factors, hormones and temperature. For example, when culturing immortalized mouse germ cells at temperatures of 35, 37 and 29℃, these cells proliferate most rapidly at the highest temperature and least rapidly at the lowest but there were varying levels of differentiation. At the highest temperature no differentiation were detected, some was seen at 37℃ and some early [[spermatid]]s appearing at 32℃.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Investigations of appropriate feeder cells concluded that a variety of cells could encourage development of germ cells such as [[Sertoli cell]]s, [[Leydig cell]]s and [[peritubular myoid cell]]s but the most essential is Sertoli cells, but Leydig and peritubular myoid cells both contribute to the microenvironment that encourage stem cells to remain [[pluripotent]] and self renew in the testis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibtisham|first=Fahar|last2=Wu|first2=Jiang|last3=Xiao|first3=Mei|last4=An|first4=Lilong|last5=Banker|first5=Zachary|last6=Nawab|first6=Aamir|last7=Zhao|first7=Yi|last8=Li|first8=Guanghui|date=2017-09-12|title=Progress and future prospect of in vitro spermatogenesis|journal=Oncotarget|volume=8|issue=39|pages=66709–66727|doi=10.18632/oncotarget.19640|issn=1949-2553|pmc=5630449|pmid=29029549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testes fragment cultures ===
[[File:Testis Organ Culture Vs Cell Culture.jpg|thumb|375x375px|This image shows the difference in process between organ culture and cell culture.]]
In fragment cultures, the testis is removed and fragments of tissue are cultured in supplemental media containing different growth factors to induce spermatogenesis and form functional gametes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The development of this culture technique has taken place mainly with the use of animal models e.g. mice or rat testis tissue.

The advantage of using this method is that it maintains the natural spatial arrangement of the [[seminiferous tubule]]s. However, [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] is a recurring problem in these cultures where the low oxygen supply hinders the development and maturation of spermatids (significantly more in adult than immature testis tissues).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other challenges with this type of culture include maintaining the structure of the seminiferous tubules which makes it more difficult for longer-term cell cultures as the tissue structures can flatten out making it hard to work with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To resolve some of these issues, 3D cultures can be used.

In 2012, mature spermatozoa capable of fertilization was isolated from ''in vitro'' culture of immature mouse testis tissue.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Hye-Won|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Miles F.|date=2012-10-01|title=In vitro spermatogenesis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3521745/|journal=Spermatogenesis|volume=2|issue=4|pages=238–244|doi=10.4161/spmg.22069|issn=2156-5554|pmc=3521745|pmid=23248764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 3D cultures ===
3D cultures use sponge, models or scaffolds that resemble the elements of the [[extracellular matrix]] to achieve a more natural spatial structure of the seminiferous tubules and to better represent the tissues and the interaction between different cell types in an ''[[ex vivo]]'' experiment. Different components of the extracellular matrix such as collagen, agar and calcium alginate are commonly used to form the gel or scaffold which can provide oxygen and nutrients.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; To propagate 3D cultures, testicular cell cultures are imbedded into the porous sponge/scaffold and allowed to colonise the structure which can then survive for several weeks to allow [[Spermatogonium|spermatogonia]] to differentiate and mature into spermatozoa.

In addition, shaking 3D cultures during the seeding process allows for an increased oxygen supply which helps overcome the issue of hypoxia and so improves the lifespan of cells.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In contrast to monocultures, fragment/3D cultures are able to establish ''in vitro'' conditions that can somewhat resemble the testicular microenvironment to allow a more accurate study of the testicular physiology and its associations with the ''in vitro'' development of sperm cells.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Future implications ==

=== Scientific ===
The ability to recapitulate spermatogenesis ''In vitro'' provides a unique opportunity to study this biological process through oftentimes cheaper and faster method of research than ''in vivo'' work. Observation is often easier ''in vitro'', as the targeted cells are mostly isolated and immobile. Another significant advantage of ''in vitro'' research is the ease with which environmental factors can be changed and monitored. There are also techniques which are not practical or feasible ''in vivo'' which can now be explored.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''In vitro'' work is not without its own challenges. For example, one loses the natural structure provided by the ''in vivo'' tissue, and thus cell connections which could be important to the function of the tissue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Clinical ===
While rodent spermatogenesis is not identical to its human counterpart, especially due to the high evolution rate of the male reproductive tract, these techniques are a solid starting point for future human applications.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Various categories of infertile men may benefit from advances in these techniques, especially those with a lack of viable gamete production. These men cannot benefit, for example, from sperm extraction techniques, and currently have little to no options for producing genetic descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fattahi|first=Amir|last2=Latifi|first2=Zeinab|last3=Ghasemnejad|first3=Tohid|last4=Nejabati|first4=Hamid Reza|last5=Nouri|first5=Mohammad|date=July 2017|title=Insights into in vitro spermatogenesis in mammals: Past, present, future|journal=Molecular Reproduction and Development|volume=84|issue=7|pages=560–575|doi=10.1002/mrd.22819|issn=1098-2795|pmid=28436137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, males who have undergone chemo/radiotherapy prepubertally may benefit from ''in vitro'' spermatogenesis. These people did not have the option to [[Cryopreservation|cryopreserve]] viable sperm before their procedure, and thus the ability to generate genetically descended sperm later in life is invaluable. Possible methods that could be applied (to this and other groups) are induction of spermatogenesis in testis samples taken prepubertally, or, if these samples are not available/viable, new methods that manipulate stem cell differentiation could produce SSCs ‘from scratch’, using [[adult stem cell]] samples.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

An alternative method is to graft preserved tissue back onto adult cancer survivors, however this comes with operational risks, as well as a risk of reintroducing malignant cells. Even if using this method however, ''in vitro'' spermatogenesis advances would allow for sample expansion and observation to better ensure quality and quantity of graft tissue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In those with healthy or preserved SSCs but without a cellular environment to support them, ''in vitro'' spermatogenesis could be used following transplant of the SSCs into healthy donor tissue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another group that could be helped by ''in vitro'' spermatogenesis are those with any form of genetic impediment to sperm production. Those with no viable SSC development are an obvious target, but also those with varying levels of spermatogenic arrest; previously their underdeveloped germ cells have been injected into oocytes, however this has a success rate of only 3% in humans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Finally, ''in vitro'' spermatogenesis using animal or human cells can be used to assess the effects and toxicity of drugs before ''in vivo'' testing.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3937">The '''International Celestial Reference System''' ('''ICRS''') is the current standard [[celestial reference system]] adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU). Its origin is at the [[barycenter]] of the [[Solar System]], with axes that are intended to be "fixed" with respect to space. ICRS coordinates are approximately the same as [[equatorial coordinate system|equatorial coordinates]]: the mean pole at [[J2000]].0 in the ICRS lies at 17.3±0.2 [[milliarcsecond|mas]] in the direction 12 h and 5.1±0.2 mas in the direction 18 h. The mean [[equinox]] of J2000.0 is shifted from the ICRS [[right ascension]] origin by 78±10 mas (direct rotation around the polar axis).

The defining extragalactic reference frame of the ICRS is the [[International Celestial Reference Frame]] (currently ICRF2) based on hundreds of [[Astronomical radio source|extra-galactic radio sources]], mostly [[quasar]]s, distributed around the entire sky. Because they are so distant, they are apparently stationary to our current technology, yet their positions can be measured with the utmost accuracy by [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]] (VLBI). The positions of most are known to 0.001 [[arc minute|arcsecond]] or better, which is orders of magnitude more precise than the best optical measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/ICRS_doc.php |title=ICRS Narrative |accessdate=2012-06-07 | publisher=&lt;!---http://aa.usno.navy.mil/index.php---&gt;U.S. Naval Observatory Astronomical Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At optical wavelengths, the ICRS is currently realized by the Hipparcos Celestial Reference Frame (HCRF), a subset of about 100,000 stars in the [[Hipparcos Catalogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/ICRS_doc.php#FROPT | title = International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) | publisher = U S Naval Observatory, Astronomical Applications Department | access-date = May 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more accurate optical realization of the ICRS (''Gaia''-CRF2), based on the observation by the [[Gaia (spacecraft)#Data releases|''Gaia'' spacecraft]] of almost 500,000 extragalactic objects believed to be quasars, is under preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Gaia Collaboration | last2 = Mignard | first2 = F.  | last3 = Klioner | first3 = S. | last4 = Lindegren | first4 = L. | last5 = et al | date = 2018 | title = ''Gaia'' Data Release 2.

During the [[interwar period]] he made a significant but controversial social effort to help women of limited means with [[sex education]], [[birth control]] and [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://denstoredanske.dk/Krop,_psyke_og_sundhed/Sundhedsvidenskab/L%C3%A6ger/Jonathan_H%C3%B8egh_von_Leunbach  Article in Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Jonathan Leunbach was the son of Jørgen Høegh Leunbach (1842-1903) and Cassandra Wilhelmine Hjardemaal (1845-1925).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geni.com/people/J%C3%B8rgen-H%C3%B8egh-Leunbach/6000000032962371954&lt;/ref&gt; He took a master's degree in medicine in 1912 and worked as a general practitioner in Brønderslev in [[Jylland]] 1915-1917. After some years of hospital employment in [[Copenhagen]], he established himself here in 1922 as a general practitioner.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.museion.ku.dk/da/aktuelt/udstillinger/9-laeger-9-liv/de-9/jonathan-leunbach/&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a [[socialism|socialist]], Leunbach was in favour of [[Wilhelm Reich|Wilhelm Reich's]] sexual political ideas. In the 1920s he was known to the public through his agitation for better sex education, safe and affordable contraception and better access to abortion, particularly for poor families with many children.  In 1924, together with writer [[Thit Jensen]] he initiated ''Foreningen for seksuel Oplysning'' (Organization for Sexual Awareness), which worked for women's right to use [[birth control]], in particular the [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]].

Thit Jensen broke off her collaboration with Leunbach in 1928, as she did not support his work for induced abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_litteraturs_historie/Dansk_litteraturs_historie_3/Kvinden_i_historien_-_Thit_Jensen/Det_frivillige_hellige_moderskab&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, Leunbach was a respected name, being co-founder of  the ''Verdensligaen for seksuel Reform'' (World League for Sexual Reform) in Copenhagen in 1927, while in Denmark he was met with massive resistance from most political parties, medical and ecclesial communities as well as the women's rights organisation [[Dansk Kvindesamfund]].

In the early 1930s Leunbach performed some 300 abortions,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  and he was charged twice with complicity in illegal abortion. He was acquitted in 1935, but the following year was sentenced to three months in prison,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dagensmedicin.dk/opinion/debat/forsvar-for-leunbach/&lt;/ref&gt; lost his civil rights for five years, including being barred from working as a doctor. He and some contemporaries regarded this as a political conviction. Leunbachs work helped launch a debate on abortion, which in 1937 brought the Danish parliament to pass Denmark's first abortion legislation, which reduced the penalty for induced abortion and gave better opportunities to let a woman have an abortion for health reasons.

In 1939, the private organisation ''Mødrehjælpen'' (Mothers' Help), which was created in 1924 to help pregnant women to have their child, regardless of whether they were married or single, was made part of the public Danish social system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dr.dk/skole/historie/doktor-leunbach&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[sexual liberation]], induced abortion was made legal in Denmark in 1973, and much of what Leunbach originally fought for is now regarded as self-evident rights.

Leunbach died in a drowning accident in Italy and is buried in [[Hellerup Cemetery]].

== Miscellaneous ==
Leunbach is mentioned in episode 10 of the Danish TV series [[Matador (Danish TV series)|Matador]], where in 1935 one of the leading ladies creates a commotion in the town by supporting his thoughts on abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://tommierieland.dk/film/matado10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;http://www.dr.dk/skole/Historie/1950erne/sexogmoral/moral1940/20100514154121_1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://matadoronline.dk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/manus-episode10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[U.S. Air Force]] '''military training leader''' ('''MTL''') is a [[non-commissioned officer]] with specific duties.They are assigned the duty of transitioning non-prior service airmen in the Air Force into the personal adjustment to military life. The MTLs' main responsibility is to continue the training the airman has learned in [[basic military training]].

==MTL history==

The military training leader (8B100) career field has undergone numerous changes to make it what it is today.  Student training advisor (STA) first started around 1973 as 99128’s.  At that time they were combined with the military training instructors and then split to their own AFSC{{clarify|date=December 2014}} (99138) in 1975. In late 1991 the name was changed to military training manager.

In October 1998, Chief Master Sergeant Doug Hodge changed the name to military training leader. This name was created as a more descriptive way to explain the duties of this position. Showing how leadership was paramount in this position. Being able to show leadership is what being an MTL is all about.

Another change to the program was the creation of a Command MTL position at 2 AF on 7 Aug 1997.  Command MTLs are the OPR for all NPS military training programs and responsible for the selection and training of all assigned MTLs.

Prior to a phase program airmen went from basic military training’s very structured, controlled environment to a “no rules” tech school environment; discipline problems were common.

Phase programs were instituted at several tech-training locations in the early 80’s, but a standardized MAJCOM directed phase program was not implemented until 1996; a MAJCOM directed phase program was implemented 1983 (est.)

AETCI 36-2216, Administration of Military Standards and Discipline Training, directs the phase program.

MTL Mission:  To adapt NPS airmen to military life and provide the AF with highly trained, motivated, self-disciplined, and physically fit airmen with exceptional military bearing.

Unlike the Army, the Air Force uses a different specialist (MTLs) to continue military training during advanced individual or technical training.

What we know now as Military Training Leaders was created in 1973.

Over the years the name has changed but the responsibilities has increased.

      <comment>/* Meiji student culture nanpa */ This section is ridiculous, thus it should be removed. Claiming that traditionally Japanese men were often "homosexuals" is a historically absurd claim, also the source given for this addition is a mere erotic novel (not at all a historically valid document).</comment>

{{nihongo|'''Nanpa'''|ナンパ}}, also [[romanization of Japanese|transliterated]] as '''nampa''', in [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]] is a type of [[flirting]] and [[seduction]] popular among [[Adolescence|teenagers]] and people in their twenties and thirties.

When Japanese women pursue men in a fashion similar to nanpa, it is called {{nihongo|'''gyakunan'''|ギャクナン}}.&lt;ref name="gyakunan"&gt;Botting, Geoff. [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20010408tc.html#1 "Japanese women on top."] ''[[The Japan Times]]'', April 8, 2001. Reprinted from ''Spa!'', April 4, 2001. Reviewed November 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Nanpa was a new word of the Meiji era with the opposite word [[Kouha]]. It was originally rendered in kanji as [[wikt:軟派|軟派]] (lit. "the soft school"). The meaning of nanpa was continually changing and different from what it means today. Initially, it referred to a political term with the meaning of "parties with soft opinion and proposition" or "people who are unable to claim a strong opinion" (1892), then it referred to "departments or reporters who are responsible for the articles of glossy things like social or literary in newspapers and magazines" (1901), eventually it meant "a faction of the youth who are enjoying pursuit of the opposite sex and fine clothing" (1909).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nihon Kokugo Daijiten 2nd edition|last = |first = |publisher = Shogakukan|year = 2001|isbn = 4095210109|location = Tokyo|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it means people interested more in fun and self-indulgence than in "hard" pursuits like politics, academia, or athletics. In contemporary Japanese culture, nanpa most often refers to "girl hunting" and there is a strong negative connotation associated with it.

The word for boyfriend hunting by women, gyakunan, derives from {{nihongo|gyaku|逆||lit. "reverse"}}, and the first part of the word nanpa.&lt;ref name="gyakunan" /&gt;

==Description==
Nanpa is seen most often in young men ranging from their late teens to mid-twenties. Groups of "nanpa boys" will gather around places with busy, predominantly female [[Pedestrian|foot traffic]] (bridges, subway stations, shopping malls, etc.) and approach women in search of a date. The nanpa groups generally wear high fashion with nice suits, expensive shoes, and extravagant hair styles. Because of their style of dress, nanpa boys are occasionally misinterpreted by [[Gaijin|foreigners]] as employees of [[Host and hostess clubs#Host clubs|host clubs]], who also roam such areas speaking with various women.{{citation needed|date = April 2018}}

Because of increasing number of nanpa participants and rising complaints, many Japanese regions are reacting more harshly to participants. For example, many youth hangouts such as arcades are posting "No Nanpa" signs, and police in highly populated Japanese cities have been enforcing these rules. This may be in reaction to a growing fear in young Japanese women of abduction or rape. The [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] district is particularly strict on nanpa boys in the wake of the abduction of four girls by a middle aged man in July 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/16/world/tokyo-journal-a-flashy-teenage-trend-capital-and-its-dark-side.html|title=Tokyo Journal; A Flashy Teenage Trend Capital, and Its Dark Side|first=Norimitsu|last=Onishi|date=16 September 2003|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Same-sex nanpa==
Japan also has a [[homosexuality|same-sex]] nanpa culture, especially within the gay entertainment district of [[Shinjuku ni-chome]].

'''Open energy system models''' are [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|models]] that are [[open source software|open source]].{{efn|
The terminology is not settled.  These models can also be known as '''open energy models''' or '''open source energy system models''' or some combination thereof.
}}  Similarly open energy system data employs [[open data]] methods to produce and distribute [[dataset]]s primarily for use by open energy system models.

Energy system models are used to explore future energy systems and are often applied to questions involving [[energy policy|energy]] and [[Politics of global warming|climate policy]].  The models themselves vary widely in terms of their type, design, programming, application, scope, level of detail, sophistication, and shortcomings.&lt;ref name="pye-and-bataille-2016"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|238}}  For many models, some form of [[mathematical optimization]] is used to inform the solution process.

Several drivers favor the development of open models and open data.  There is an increasing interest in making [[public policy]] energy models more transparent to improve their acceptance by policymakers and the public.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a desire to leverage the benefits that open data and [[open-source software development|open software development]] can bring, including reduced duplication of effort, better sharing of ideas and information, improved quality, and wider engagement and adoption.&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"/&gt;  Model development is therefore usually a [[collaborative software development model|team effort]] and constituted as either an academic project, a commercial venture, or a genuinely inclusive community initiative.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The project repository may be hosted on an institutional server or on a public [[Comparison of open source software hosting facilities|code-hosting site]], such as [[GitHub]].  Some projects release only their [[codebase]], while others ship some or all of their [[dataset]]s as well.  Projects may also offer [[Electronic mailing list|email lists]], [[Online chat|chat rooms]], and [[Internet forum|web forums]] to aid collaboration.

The majority of projects are based within university research groups, either singingly or as academic collaborations.

Open energy system modeling came of age in the 2010s.  Just two projects were cited in a 2011 paper on the topic: [[#OSeMOSYS|OSeMOSYS]] and [[#TEMOA|TEMOA]].&lt;ref name="howells-etal-2011"/&gt;{{rp|5861}}  [[#Balmorel|Balmorel]] was also active at that time, having been made public in 2001.{{efn|
[[#NEMO|NEMO]] was also under development in 2011 but it is unclear whether its codebase was public at that point.
}}  {{as of|2017|03}}, this article lists 25 such undertakings (with a further six waiting to be [[Talk:Open energy system models#Further models|added]]).

=== Transparency, comprehensibility, and reproducibility ===

{{see also|Open Energy Modelling Initiative#Context}}

The use of open energy system models and open energy data represents one attempt to improve the transparency, comprehensibility, and reproducibility of energy system models, particularly those used to aid public policy development.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"/&gt;

A 2010 paper concerning energy efficiency modeling argues that "an open peer review process can greatly support model verification and validation, which are essential for model development".&lt;ref name="mundaca-etal-2010a"&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/ref&gt;  To further honor the process of [[peer review]], researchers argue, in a 2012 paper, that it is essential to place both the [[source code]] and [[dataset]]s under publicly accessible [[version control]] so that third-parties can run, verify, and scrutinize specific models.&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"/&gt;  A 2016 paper contends that model-based energy scenario studies, seeking to influence decision-makers in government and industry, must become more comprehensible and more transparent.  To these ends, the paper provides a [[checklist]] of transparency criteria that should be completed by modelers.  The authors however state that they "consider open source approaches to be an extreme case of transparency that does not automatically facilitate the comprehensibility of studies for policy advice."&lt;ref name="cao-etal-2016"&gt;

A one-page opinion piece from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis.  The article also argues that [[academic journal|scientific journals]] have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"&gt;&lt;!-- alternative url: http://www.nature.com/news/energy-scientists-must-show-their-workings-1.21517 --&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State projects ===

State-sponsored open source projects in any domain are a relatively new phenomena.

{{as of|2017}}, the [[European Commission]] now supports several open source energy system modeling projects to aid the transition to a low-carbon energy system for Europe.  The Dispa-SET project ([[#Dispa-SET|below]]) is modeling the European electricity system and hosts its codebase on [[GitHub]].  The MEDEAS project, which will design and implement a new open source energy-economy model for Europe, held its kick-off meeting in February 2016.&lt;ref name="set-plan-2016-one"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  {{as of|2017|02}}, the project had yet to publish any source code.  The established OSeMOSYS project ([[#OSeMOSYS|below]]) is developing a multi-sector energy model for Europe with Commission funding to support stakeholder outreach.&lt;ref name="howells-2016"&gt;

The United States [[National Energy Modeling System|NEMS]] national model is available but nonetheless difficult to use.  NEMS does not classify as an open source project in the accepted sense.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"/&gt;

== Open electricity sector models ==

Open electricity sector models are confined to just the electricity sector.  These models invariably have a temporal resolution of one hour or less.  Some models concentrate on the engineering characteristics of the system, including a good representation of [[Electric power transmission|high-voltage transmission networks]] and [[Power-flow study|AC power flow]].  Others models depict electricity [[spot market]]s and are known as dispatch models.  While other models embed [[Agent-based model|autonomous agents]] to capture, for instance, [[Auction|bidding decisions]] using techniques from [[bounded rationality]].  The ability to handle [[variable renewable energy]], transmission systems, and [[Grid energy storage|grid storage]] are becoming important considerations.

DIETER stands for Dispatch and Investment Evaluation Tool with Endogenous Renewables.  DIETER is a dispatch and investment model. It was first used to study the role of [[Grid energy storage|power storage]] and other flexibility options in a future [[Greenfield project|greenfield]] setting with high shares of renewable generation.  DIETER is being developed at the [[German Institute for Economic Research]] (DIW), [[Berlin]], Germany.  The [[codebase]] and [[Data (computing)|datasets]] for Germany can be downloaded from the project website.  The basic model is fully described in a DIW working paper and a journal article.&lt;ref name="zerrahn-and-schill-2015"&gt;

DIETER is framed as a pure [[Linear programming|linear]] (no integer variables) cost minimization problem.  In the initial formulation, the decision variables include the investment in and dispatch of generation, storage, and [[Energy demand management|DSM]] capacities in the German wholesale and balancing electricity markets.

The first study using DIETER examines the power storage requirements for renewables uptake ranging from 60% to 100%.  Under the baseline scenario of 80% (the lower bound German government target for 2050), [[Grid energy storage|grid storage]] requirements remain moderate and other options on both the supply side and demand side offer flexibility at low cost.  Nonetheless storage plays an important role in the provision of reserves.  Storage becomes more pronounced under higher shares of renewables, but strongly depends on the costs and availability of other flexibility options, particularly biomass availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schill|first=Wolf-Peter|last2=Zerrahn|first2=Alexander|title=Long-run power storage requirements for high shares of renewables: Results and sensitivities|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.205|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.205|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model power system is managed by a single operator with full knowledge of the economic and technical characteristics of the generation units, the loads at each node, and the heavily simplified transmission network.  Demand is deemed fully [[Elasticity (economics)|inelastic]].  The system is subject to intra-period and inter-period [[Unit commitment problem in electrical power production|unit commitment]] constraints (the latter covering nuclear and thermal generation for the most part) and operated under [[economic dispatch]].&lt;ref name="quoilin-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|4}}  Hourly data is used and the simulation horizon is normally one year.  But to ensure the model remains tractable, two day rolling horizon optimization is employed.  The model advances in steps of one day, optimizing the next 48{{nbsp}}hours ahead but retaining results for just the first 24{{nbsp}}hours.&lt;ref name="quoilin-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|14–15}}

EMLab-Generation simulates the actions of [[Electric power industry|power companies]] investing in generation capacity and uses this to explore the long-term effects of various [[Energy policy|energy]] and [[Climate change mitigation|climate protection]] policies.  These policies may target renewable generation, {{CO2}} emissions, security of supply, and/or energy affordability.  The power companies are the main agents: they bid into power markets and they invest based on the [[net present value]] (NPV) of prospective power plant projects.  They can adopt a variety of technologies, using scenarios from the 2011 [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] [[World Energy Outlook]].&lt;ref name="iea-2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The agent-based methodology enables different sets of assumptions to be tested, such as the heterogeneity of actors, the consequences of imperfect expectations, and the behavior of investors outside of ideal conditions.

EMLab-Generation offers a new way of modeling the effects of public policy on electricity markets.  It can provide insights into actor and system behaviors over time – including such things as investment cycles, abatement cycles, delayed responses, and the effects of uncertainty and risk on investment decisions.

A 2014 study using EMLab-Generation investigates the effects of introducing floor and ceiling prices for {{CO2}} under the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU ETS]].  And in particular, their influence on the dynamic investment pathway of two interlinked electricity markets (loosely Great Britain and Central Western Europe).  The study finds a common, moderate {{CO2}} auction reserve price results in a more continuous decarbonisation pathway and reduces {{CO2}} price volatility.  Adding a ceiling price can shield consumers from extreme price shocks.  Such price restrictions should not lead to an overshoot of emissions targets in the long-run.&lt;ref name="richstein-etal-2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  EMMA is written in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]] and uses the [[CPLEX]] commercial solver.

EMMA models electricity dispatch and investment, minimizing the total cost with respect to investment, generation, and trades between market areas.  In economic terms, EMMA classifies as a [[partial equilibrium]] model of the wholesale [[electricity market]] with a focus on the supply-side.  EMMA identifies short-term or long-term optima (or equilibria) and estimates the corresponding capacity mix, hourly prices, dispatch, and cross-border trading.  Technically, EMMA is a pure [[Linear programming|linear program]] (no integer variables) with about two million {{nowrap|non-zero}} variables.  {{as of|2016}}, the model covers Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland and supports conventional generation, renewable generation, and [[cogeneration]].&lt;ref name="hirth-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hirth-2014"&gt;

EMMA has been used to study the economic effects of the increasing penetration of [[variable renewable energy]] (VRE), specifically solar power and wind power, in the Northwestern European power system.  A 2013 study finds that increasing VRE shares will depress prices and, as a consequence, the competitive large-scale deployment of renewable generation will be more difficult to accomplish than many anticipate.&lt;ref name="hirth-2013"&gt;

GENESYS stands for Genetic Optimisation of a European Energy Supply System.  The software is being developed jointly by the [http://www.iaew.rwth-aachen.de/?lang=en Institute of Power Systems and Power Economics] (IAEW) and the [https://www2.isea.rwth-aachen.de/de Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives] (ISEA), both of [[RWTH Aachen University]], [[Aachen]], Germany.  The project maintains a website where potential users can request access to the [[codebase]] and the [[Data (computing)|dataset]] for the 2050 base scenario only.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Detailed descriptions of the software are available.&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2016"/&gt;  GENESYS is written in [[C++]] and uses [[Boost (C++ libraries)|Boost]] libraries, the [[MySQL]] relational database, the [[Qt (software)|Qt{{nbsp}}4]] application framework, and optionally the [[CPLEX]] solver.

The GENESYS simulation tool is designed to optimize a future EUMENA (Europe, Middle East, and North Africa) power system and assumes a high share of renewable generation.  It is able to find an economically optimal distribution of generator, storage, and transmission capacities within a 21{{nbsp}}region EUMENA.  It allows for the optimization of this energy system in combination with an evolutionary method.  The optimization is based on a [[CMA-ES|covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy]] (CMA-ES), while the operation is simulated as a hierarchical set-up of system elements which balance the load between the various regions at minimum cost using the [[network simplex algorithm]].  GENESYS ships with a set of input time series and a set of parameters for the year 2050, which the user can modify.

A future EUMENA energy supply system with a high share of renewable energy sources (RES) will need a strongly interconnected energy transport grid and significant energy storage capacities.  GENESYS was used to dimension the storage and transmission between the 21{{nbsp}}different regions.  Under the assumption of 100% self-supply, about {{val|2500|u=GW}} of RES in total and a storage capacity of about {{val|240000|u=GWh}} are needed, corresponding to 6% of the annual energy demand, and a HVDC transmission grid of {{val|375000|u=GW·km}}.  The combined cost estimate for generation, storage, and transmission, excluding distribution, is 6.87{{nbsp}}¢/kWh.&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2014"&gt;

A 2016 study looked at the relationship between storage and transmission capacity under high shares of renewable energy sources (RES) in an EUMENA power system.  It found that, up to a certain extent, transmission capacity and storage capacity can substitute for each other.  For a transition to a fully renewable energy system by 2050, major structural changes are required.  The results indicate the optimal allocation of photovoltaics and wind power, the resulting demand for storage capacities of different technologies (battery, pumped hydro, and hydrogen storage) and the capacity of the transmission grid.&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2016"&gt;

NEMO, the National Electricity Market Optimiser, is a chronological dispatch model for testing and optimizing different portfolios of conventional and renewable electricity generation technologies.  It applies solely to the Australian [[National Electricity Market]] (NEM), which, despite its name, is limited to east and south Australia.  NEMO has been in development at the [http://www.ceem.unsw.edu.au/ Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets] (CEEM), [[University of New South Wales]] (UNSW), [[Sydney]], Australia since 2011.&lt;ref name="nemo-website"&gt;

The solution space of generator capacities is searched using the [[CMA-ES]] (covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy) algorithm.  The timestep is arbitrary but one hour is normally employed.

NEMO has been used to explore generation options for the year 2030 under a variety of renewable energy (RE) and abated fossil fuel technology scenarios.  A 2012 study investigates the feasibility of a fully renewable system using [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP) with thermal storage, [[Wind power|windfarms]], [[photovoltaics]], existing [[hydroelectricity]], and [[biofuel]]led [[gas turbine]]s.  A number of potential systems, which also meet NEM reliability criteria, are identified.  The principal challenge is servicing peak demand on winter evenings following overcast days and periods of low wind.&lt;ref name="elliston-etal-2012"&gt;

pandapower is a power system analysis and optimization program being jointly developed by the Energy Management and Power System Operation research group, [[University of Kassel]] and the Department for Distribution System Operation, [[Fraunhofer Institute]] for Energy Economics and Energy System Technology (IEE), both of [[Kassel]], Germany.  The codebase is hosted on [[GitHub]] and is also available as a [[Python Package Index|package]].  The project maintains a website, an [[Electronic mailing list|emailing list]], and online documentation.  pandapower is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].  It uses the [[pandas (software)|pandas]] library for data manipulation and analysis and the PYPOWER library{{nnbsp}}&lt;ref name="pypower-website"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; to solve for [[Power-flow study|power flow]].  Unlike some open source power system tools, pandapower does not depend on proprietary platforms like [[MATLAB]].

pandapower supports the automated analysis and optimization of [[Electric power distribution|distribution]] and transmission networks.  This allows a large of number of scenarios to be explored, based on different future grid configurations and technologies.  pandapower offers a collection of power system elements, including: lines, 2-winding transformers, 3-winding transformers, and ward-equivalents.  It also contains a switch model that allows the modeling of ideal bus-bus switches as well as bus-line/bus-trafo switches.  The software supports topological searching.  The network itself can be plotted, with or without geographical information, using the [[matplotlib]] and [[plotly]] libraries.

A 2016 publication evaluates the usefulness of the software by undertaking several case studies with major distribution system operators (DSO).  These studies examine the integration of increasing levels of [[photovoltaics]] into existing distribution grids.  The study concludes that being able to test a large number of detailed scenarios is essential for robust grid planning.  Notwithstanding, issues of data availability and problem dimensionality will continue to present challenges.&lt;ref name="scheidler-etal-2016"&gt;

A 2018 paper describes the package and its design and provides an example case study.  The article explains how users work with an element-based model (EBM) which is converted internally to a bus-branch model (BBM) for computation.  The package supports power system simulation, optimal power flow calculations (cost information is required), state estimation (should the system characterization lacks fidelity), and [[graph theory|graph]]-based network analysis.  The case study shows how a few tens of lines of scripting can interface with pandapower to advance the design of a system subject to diverse operating requirements.  The associated code is hosted on GitHub as [[Project Jupyter|jupyter notebooks]].&lt;ref name="thurner-etal-2018"&gt;

The PowerMatcher software implements a [[smart grid]] coordination mechanism which balances [[Distributed generation|distributed energy resources]] (DER) and flexible loads through autonomous [[bidding]].  The project is managed by the Flexiblepower Alliance Network (FAN) in [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands.  The project maintains a website and the [[source code]] is hosted on [[GitHub]].  {{as of|2016|06}}, existing datasets are not available.  PowerMatcher is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

Each device in the smart grid system – whether a washing machine, a wind generator, or an industrial turbine – expresses its willingness to consume or produce electricity in the form of a bid.  These bids are then collected and used to determine an equilibrium price.  The PowerMatcher software thereby allows high shares of renewable energy to be integrated into existing electricity systems and should also avoid any local overloading in possibly aging distribution networks.&lt;ref name="kok-2013"&gt;

renpass is an electricity dispatch model which minimizes system costs for each time step (optimization) within the limits of a given infrastructure (simulation).  Time steps are optionally 15 minutes or one hour.  The method assumes perfect foresight.  renpass supports the electricity systems found in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland.

The optimization problem for each time step is to minimize the electricity supply cost using the existing power plant fleet for all regions.  After this regional dispatch, the exchange between the regions is carried out and is restricted by the grid capacity.  This latter problem is solved with a heuristic procedure rather than calculated deterministically.  The input is the merit order, the marginal power plant, the excess energy (renewable energy that could be curtailed), and the excess demand (the demand that cannot be supplied) for each region.  The exchange algorithm seeks the least cost for all regions, thus the target function is to minimize the total costs of all regions, given the existing grid infrastructure, storage, and generating capacities.  The total cost is defined as the residual load multiplied by the price in each region, summed over all regions.

A 2012 study uses renpass to examine the feasibility of a 100% renewable electricity system for the [[Baltic Sea]] region (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden) in the year 2050.  The base scenario presumes conservative renewable potentials and grid enhancements, a 20% drop in demand, a moderate uptake of storage options, and the deployment of biomass for flexible generation.  The study finds that a 100% renewable electricity system is possible, albeit with occasional imports from abutting countries, and that biomass plays a key role in system stability.  The costs for this transition are estimated at 50{{nbsp}}€/MWh.&lt;ref name="bernhardi-etal-2012"&gt;

SciGRID, short for Scientific Grid, is an open source model of the German and European [[Electric power transmission|electricity transmission networks]].  The research project is managed by [http://www.next-energy.de/en/ Next Energy] (officially the EWE Research Centre for Energy Technology) located at the [[University of Oldenburg]], [[Oldenburg (Oldenburg)|Oldenburg]], Germany.  The project maintains a website and an email newsletter.  SciGRID is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses a [[PostgreSQL]] database.  The first release (v0.1) was made on 15{{nbsp}}June 2015.

SciGRID aims to rectify the lack of open research data on the structure of electricity transmission networks within Europe.  This lack of data frustrates attempts to build, characterise, and compare high resolution energy system models.  SciGRID utilizes transmission network data available from the [[OpenStreetMap]] project, available under the [[Open Database License]] (ODbL), to automatically author transmission connections.  SciGRID will not use data from closed sources.  SciGRID can also mathematically decompose a given network into a simpler representation for use in energy models.&lt;ref name="matke-etal-2015"&gt;

In addition, 11.1{{nbsp}}million tonnes of {{CO2}}eq emissions would be avoided.  The modeling assumes a carbon price of [[Australian dollar|AUD]]{{nbsp}}$30/t{{CO2}}.  Further scenarios examine the goal of 100% renewable generation.&lt;ref name="rose-2016"&gt;

SWITCH is a loose acronym for solar, wind, conventional and hydroelectric generation, and transmission.  SWITCH is an optimal planning model for power systems with large shares of renewable energy.  SWITCH is being developed by the Department of Electrical Engineering, [[University of Hawai'i]], [[Mānoa]], [[Hawaii]], USA.  The project runs a small website and hosts its [[codebase]] and [[Data (computing)|datasets]] on [[GitHub]].  SWITCH is written in [[Pyomo]], an optimization components library programmed in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].  It can use either the open source [[GLPK]] solver or the commercial [[CPLEX]] and [[Gurobi]] solvers.

SWITCH is a power system model, focused on renewables integration.  It can identify which generator and transmission projects to build in order to satisfy electricity demand at the lowest cost over a several year period while also reducing {{CO2}} emissions.  SWITCH utilizes multi-stage [[Stochastic linear program|stochastic linear optimization]] with the objective of minimizing the present value of the cost of power plants, transmission capacity, fuel usage, and an arbitrary per-tonne {{CO2}} charge (to represent either a carbon tax or a certificate price), over the course of a multi-year investment period.  It has two major sets of decision variables.  First, at the start of each investment period, SWITCH selects how much generation capacity to build in each of several geographic load zones, how much power transfer capability to add between these zones, and whether to operate existing generation capacity during the investment period or to temporarily mothball it to avoid fixed operation and maintenance costs.  Second, for a set of sample days within each investment period, SWITCH makes hourly decisions about how much power to generate from each dispatchable power plant, store at each [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped hydro]] facility, or transfer along each transmission interconnector.  The system must also ensure enough generation and transmission capacity to provide a planning reserve margin of 15% above the load forecasts.  For each sampled hour, SWITCH uses electricity demand and renewable power production based on actual measurements, so that the weather-driven correlations between these elements remain intact.

Following the optimization phase, SWITCH is used in a second phase to test the proposed investment plan against a more complete set of weather conditions and to add backstop generation capacity so that the planning reserve margin is always met.  Finally, in a third phase, the costs are calculated by freezing the investment plan and operating the proposed power system over a full set of weather conditions.

A 2012 paper uses [[California]] from 2012 to 2027 as a [[case study]] for SWITCH.  The study finds that there is no ceiling on the amount of wind and solar power that could be used and that these resources could potentially reduce emissions by 90% or more (relative to 1990 levels) without reducing reliability or severely raising costs.  Furthermore, policies that encourage electricity customers to shift demand to times when renewable power is most abundant (for example, though the well-timed charging of [[electric vehicle]]s) could achieve radical emission reductions at moderate cost.&lt;ref name="fripp-2012"&gt;

URBS, [[Latin]] for city, is a [[linear programming]] model for exploring capacity expansion and unit commitment problems and is particularly suited to [[Distributed generation|distributed energy systems]] (DES).  It is being developed by the [https://www.ens.ei.tum.de/en/ Institute for Renewable and Sustainable Energy Systems], [[Technical University of Munich]], Germany.  The [[codebase]] is hosted on [[GitHub]].  URBS is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Pyomo]] optimization packages.

URBS classes as an energy modeling framework and attempts to minimize the total discounted cost of the system.  A particular model selects from a set of technologies to meet a predetermined electricity demand.  It uses a time resolution of one hour and the spatial resolution is model-defined.  The decision variables are the capacities for the production, storage, and transport of electricity and the time scheduling for their operation.&lt;ref name="huber-etal-2012"&gt;

== Open energy system models ==

Open energy system models capture some or all of the energy commodities found in an energy system.  All models include the electricity sector.  Some models add the heat sector, which can be important for countries with significant [[district heating]].  Other models add gas networks.  With the advent of [[Electric vehicle|emobility]], other models still include aspects of the transport sector.  Indeed, coupling these various sectors using [[power-to-X]] technologies is an emerging area of research.&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2014"/&gt;

Balmorel is a market-based energy system model from Denmark.  Development was originally financed by the Danish Energy Research Program in 2001.&lt;ref name="wiese-2015"/&gt;{{rp|23}}  The codebase was made public in March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Personal email from Hans Ravn dated 11{{nbsp}}December 2016.  This makes Balmorel the first open energy modeling project to go public by quite a margin.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Balmorel project maintains an extensive website, from where the [[codebase]] and [[Data (computing)|dataset]]s can be download as a [[Zip (file format)|zip file]].

&lt;/ref&gt;  Balmorel is written in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]].

&lt;/ref&gt;  These ambitions and limitations have long since been superseded and Balmorel is no longer tied to its original geography and policy questions.&lt;ref name="ravn-2012"/&gt;  Balmorel classes as a dispatch and investment model and uses a time resolution of one hour.  It models electricity and heat supply and demand, and supports the intertemporal storage of both.  Balmorel is structured as a pure [[linear programming|linear program]] (no integer variables).

{{as of|2016}}, Balmorel has been the subject of some 22{{nbsp}}publications.  A 2008 study uses Balmorel to explore the Nordic energy system in 2050.  The focus is on renewable energy supply and the deployment of hydrogen as the main transport fuel.  Given certain assumptions about the future price of oil and carbon and the uptake of hydrogen, the model shows that it is economically optimal to cover, using renewable energy, more than 95% of the primary energy consumption for electricity and district heat and 65% of the transport.&lt;ref name="karlsson-and-meibom-2008"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2010 study uses Balmorel to examine the integration of [[Plug-in hybrid|plug-in hybrid vehicle]]s (PHEV) into a system comprising one quarter wind power and three quarters thermal generation.  The study shows that PHEVs can reduce the {{CO2}} emissions from the power system if actively integrated, whereas a hands-off approach – letting people charge their cars at will – is likely to result in an increase in emissions.&lt;ref name="goeransson-etal-2010"&gt;

Calliope is an energy system modeling framework, with a focus on flexibility, high spatial and temporal resolution, and the ability to execute different runs using the same base-case dataset.  The project is being developed at the [https://www.usys.ethz.ch/en/ Department of Environmental Systems Science], [[ETH Zurich]], [[Zürich]], Switzerland.  The project maintains a website, hosts the [[codebase]] at [[GitHub]], operates an [https://github.com/calliope-project/calliope/issues issues tracker], and runs two [[Electronic mailing list|email lists]].  Calliope is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Pyomo]] library.  It can link to the open source [[GLPK]] solver and the commercial [[CPLEX]] and [[Gurobi]] solvers.  PDF documentation is available.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A Calliope model consists of a collection of structured text files, in [[YAML]] and [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] formats, that define the technologies, locations, and resource potentials.  Calliope takes these files, constructs a pure [[Linear programming|linear optimization]] (no integer variables) problem, solves it, and reports the results in the form of [[pandas (software)|pandas]] [[data structures]] for analysis.  The framework contains five [[Abstract type|abstract]] base technologies – supply, demand, conversion, storage, transmission – from which new concrete technologies can be derived.  The design of Calliope enforces the clear separation of framework (code) and model (data).

A 2015 study uses Calliope to compare the future roles of [[nuclear power]] and [[Concentrated solar power|CSP]] in [[South Africa]].  It finds CSP could be competitive with nuclear by 2030 for baseload and more competitive when producing above baseload.  CSP also offers less investment risk, less environmental risk, and other co-benefits.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-and-keirstead-2015-a"&gt;

Three generation technologies are tested: renewables, nuclear power, and fossil fuels with and without [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS).  The scenarios are assessed on financial cost, emissions reductions, and energy security.  Up to 60% of [[Variable renewable energy|variable renewable]] capacity is possible with little increase in cost, while higher shares require large-scale [[Grid energy storage|storage]], imports, and/or [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]] renewables such as [[Tidal power|tidal range]].&lt;ref name="pfenninger-and-keirstead-2015-b"&gt;

DESSTinEE stands for Demand for Energy Services, Supply and Transmission in EuropE.  DESSTinEE is a model of the European energy system in 2050 with a focus on the electricity system.  DESSTinEE is being developed primarily at the [[Imperial College Business School]], [[Imperial College London]] (ICL), [[London]], United Kingdom.  The software can be downloaded from the project website.  DESSTinEE is written in [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]/[[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]] and comprises a set of standalone [[spreadsheet]]s.  A flier is available.&lt;ref name="desstinee-2015"&gt;

DESSTinEE is designed to investigate assumptions about the technical requirements for energy transport – particularly electricity – and the scale of the economic challenge to develop the necessary infrastructure.  Forty countries are considered in and around Europe and ten forms of primary and secondary energy are supported.  The model uses a predictive simulation technique, rather than solving for either [[Partial equilibrium|partial]] or [[Computable general equilibrium|general equilibrium]].  The model projects annual energy demands for each country to 2050, synthesizes hourly profiles for electricity demand in 2010 and 2050, and simulates the least-cost generation and transmission of electricity around the region.&lt;ref name="openmod-wiki-desstinee"&gt;

A 2016 study using DESSTinEE (and a second model eLOAD) examines the evolution of electricity load curves in Germany and Britain from the present until 2050.  In 2050, peak loads and ramp rates rise 20–60% and system utilization falls 15–20%, in part due to the substantial uptake of [[heat pump]]s and [[electric vehicle]]s.  These are significant changes.&lt;ref name="bossmann-and-staffell-2016"&gt;

The Energy Transition Model (ETM) is an interactive web-based model using a holistic description of a country's energy system.  It is being developed by Quintel Intelligence, [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands.  The project maintains a project website, an interactive website, and a [[GitHub]] repository.  ETM is written in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] (on [[Ruby on Rails|Rails]]) and displays in a [[web browser]].  ETM consists of several software components as described in the documentation.

ETM is fully interactive.  After selecting a region (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, United Kingdom, EU-27, or Brazil) and a year (2020, 2030, 2040, or 2050), the user can set 300 sliders (or enter numerical values) to explore the following:

* targets: set goals for the scenario and see if they can be achieved, targets comprise: {{CO2}} reductions, renewables shares, total cost, and caps on imports 
* demands: expand or restrict energy demand in the future
* costs: project the future costs of energy carriers and energy technologies, these costs do not include taxes or subsidies
* supplies: select which technologies can be used to produce heat or electricity

ETM is based on an energy graph ([[Directed graph|digraph]]) where nodes ([[Glossary of graph theory#vertex|vertices]]) can convert from one type of energy to another, possibly with losses.  The connections ([[Glossary of graph theory#edge|directed edges]]) are the energy flows and are characterized by volume (in [[megajoule]]s) and carrier type (such as coal, electricity, usable-heat, and so forth).  Given a demand and other choices, ETM calculates the primary energy use, the total cost, and the resulting {{CO2}} emissions.  The model is demand driven, meaning that the digraph is traversed from ''useful demand'' (such as space heating, hot water usage, and car-kilometers) to ''primary demand'' (the extraction of gas, the import of coal, and so forth).

EnergyPATHWAYS is a bottom-up energy sector model used to explore the near-term implications of long-term deep decarbonization.  The lead developer is energy and climate protection consultancy, Evolved Energy Research, [[San Francisco]], USA.  The code is hosted on [[GitHub]].  EnergyPATHWAYS is written in [[Python (computer language)|Python]] and links to the open source [[COIN-OR#CBC|Cbc]] solver.  Alternatively, the [[GLPK]], [[CPLEX]], or [[Gurobi]] solvers can be employed.  EnergyPATHWAYS utilizes the [[PostgreSQL]] [[object-relational database management system]] (ORDBMS) to manage its [[Data (computing)|data]].

EnergyPATHWAYS is a comprehensive accounting framework used to construct economy-wide energy infrastructure scenarios.  While portions of the model do use [[linear programming]] techniques, for instance, for electricity dispatch, the EnergyPATHWAYS model is not fundamentally an optimization model and embeds few decision dynamics.  EnergyPATHWAYS offers detailed energy, cost, and emissions accounting for the energy flows from primary supply to final demand.  The energy system representation is flexible, allowing for differing levels of detail and the nesting of cities, states, and countries.  The model uses hourly least-cost electricity dispatch and supports [[power-to-gas]], short-duration energy storage, long-duration energy storage, and [[demand response]].  Scenarios typically run to 2050.

A predecessor of the EnergyPATHWAYS software, named simply PATHWAYS, has been used to construct policy models.  The California PATHWAYS model was used to inform Californian state climate targets for 2030.&lt;ref name="williams-etal-2012"&gt;

ETEM is a bottom-up model that identifies the optimal energy and technology options for a regional or city.  The model finds an energy policy with minimal cost, while investing in new equipment (new technologies), developing production capacity (installed technologies), and/or proposing the feasible import/export of primary energy.  ETEM typically casts forward 50{{nbsp}}years, in two or five year steps, with time slices of four seasons using typically individual days or finer.  The spatial resolution can be highly detailed.  Electricity and heat are both supported, as are [[district heating]] networks, household energy systems, and grid storage, including the use of [[plug-in hybrid|plug-in hybrid electric vehicles]] (PHEV).  ETEM-SG, a development, supports [[demand response]], an option which would be enabled by the development of [[smart grid]]s.

The ETEM model has been applied to Luxembourg, the Geneva and Basel-Bern-Zurich cantons in Switzerland, and the Grenoble metropolitan and Midi-Pyrénées region in France.  A 2005 study uses ETEM to study climate protection in the Swiss housing sector.  The ETEM model was coupled with the GEMINI-E3 world [[Computable general equilibrium|computable general equilibrium model]] (CGEM) to complete the analysis.&lt;ref name="drouet-etal-2005"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2012 study examines the design of [[smart grid]]s.  As distribution systems become more intelligent, so must the models needed to analysis them.  ETEM is used to assess the potential of smart grid technologies using a [[case study]], roughly calibrated on the [[Geneva]] canton, under three scenarios.  These scenarios apply different constraints on {{CO2}} emissions and electricity imports.  A stochastic approach is used to deal with the uncertainty in future electricity prices and the uptake of electric vehicles.&lt;ref name="babonneau-2012"&gt;

ficus is a [[Mixed integer program|mixed integer]] optimization model for local energy systems.  It is being developed at the [https://www.ewk.ei.tum.de/en/startseite/ Institute for Energy Economy and Application Technology], [[Technical University of Munich]], [[Munich]], Germany.  The project maintains a website.  The project is hosted on [[GitHub]].  ficus is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Pyomo]] library.  The user can choose between the open source [[GLPK]] solver or the commercial [[CPLEX]] and [[Gurobi]] solvers.

Based on [[#URBS|URBS]], ficus was originally developed for optimizing the energy systems of factories and has now been extended to include local energy systems.  ficus supports multiple energy commodities – goods that can be imported or exported, generated, stored, or consumed – including electricity and heat.  It supports multiple-input and multiple-output energy conversion technologies with load-dependent efficiencies.  The objective of the model is to supply the given demand at minimal cost.  ficus uses exogenous cost time series for imported commodities as well as peak demand charges with a configurable timebase for each commodity in use.

The project runs two websites and a [[GitHub]] repository.  oemof is written in [[Python (computer language)|Python]] and uses [[Pyomo]] and [[COIN-OR]] components for optimization.  Energy systems can be represented using spreadsheets ([[Comma-separated values|CSV]]) which should simplify data preparation.  {{nowrap|Version 0.1.0}} was released on 1{{nbsp}}December 2016.

oemof classes as an energy modeling framework.  It consists of a [[Linear programming|linear]] or [[Mixed integer program|mixed integer]] optimization problem formulation library (solph), an input data generation library (feedin-data), and other auxiliary libraries.  The solph library is used to represent multi-regional and multi-sectoral (electricity, heat, gas, mobility) systems and can optimize for different targets, such as financial cost or {{CO2}} emissions.  Furthermore, it is possible to switch between dispatch and investment modes.  In terms of scope, oemof can capture the European power system or alternatively it can describe a complex local power and heat sector scheme.

OSeMOSYS stands for Open Source Energy Modelling System.  OSeMOSYS is intended for national and regional policy development and uses an intertemperal optimization framework.  The model posits a single socially motivated operator/investor with perfect foresight.  The OSeMOSYS project is a community endeavor, supported by the Energy Systems Analysis Group (dESA), [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]], [[Stockholm]], Sweden.  The project maintains a website providing background. The project also offers several active [[internet forum]]s on [[Reddit]].  OSeMOSYS was originally written in [[MathProg]], a high-level [[Mathematical optimization|mathematical programming]] language.  It was subsequently reimplemented in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and all three codebases are now maintained.  The project also provides a test model called UTOPIA.&lt;ref name="lavigne-2017"/&gt;  A manual is available.&lt;ref name="moksnes-etal-2015"&gt;

OSeMOSYS provides a framework for the analysis of energy systems over the medium (10–15 years) and long term (50–100 years).  OSeMOSYS uses pure [[Linear programming|linear optimization]], with the option of [[mixed integer programming]] for the treatment of, for instance, discrete power plant capacity expansions.  It covers most energy sectors, including heat, electricity, and transport.  OSeMOSYS is driven by exogenously defined [[Energy system#Energy-services|energy services]] demands.  These are then met through a set of technologies which draw on a set of resources, both characterized by their potentials and costs.  These resources are not limited to energy commodities and may include, for example, water and [[Land use, land-use change and forestry|land-use]].  This enables OSeMOSYS to be applied in domains other than energy, such as water systems.  Technical constraints, economic restrictions, and/or environmental targets may also be imposed to reflect policy considerations.  OSeMOSYS is available in extended and compact MathProg formulations, either of which should give identical results.  In its extended version, OSeMOSYS comprises a little more than 400 [[Source lines of code|lines of code]].

PyPSA stands for Python for Power System Analysis.  PyPSA is a free software toolbox for simulating and optimizing electric power systems and allied sectors.  It supports conventional generation, variable wind and solar generation, electricity storage, [[Power-to-X#Sector coupling concepts|coupling]] to the natural gas, hydrogen, heat, and transport sectors, and hybrid alternating and direct current networks.  Moreover, PyPSA is designed to scale well.  The project is managed by the [https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/index.php Institute for Automation and Applied Informatics] (IAI), [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (KIT), [[Karlsruhe]], Germany, although the project itself exists independently under its own name and accounts.  The project maintains a website and runs an [[Electronic mailing list|email list]].  PyPSA itself is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Pyomo]] library.  The [[source code]] is hosted on [[GitHub]] and is also released periodically as a [[Python Package Index|PyPI]] package.

[[File:Simulated locational marginal prices produced by PyPSA energy system model.svg|thumb|left|Simulated [[Electricity market#Bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices|locational marginal prices]] across [[Germany]] under conditions of high wind and low load.  Bottlenecks in north/south power transmission elicit the large differences.&lt;ref name="brown-etal-2018-pypsa"/&gt;{{rp|11}}]]

The basic functionality of PyPSA is described in a 2018 paper.  PyPSA sits between traditional steady-state power flow analysis software and full multi-period energy system models.  It can be invoked using either non-linear power flow equations for system simulation or linearized approximations to enable the joint optimization of operations and investment across multiple periods.  Generator ramping and multi-period up and down-times can be specified, [[demand side management|DSM]] is supported, but demand remains [[price elasticity of demand|price inelastic]].&lt;ref name="brown-etal-2018-pypsa"&gt;

A 2018 study examines potential synergies between [[power-to-X#sector coupling concepts|sector coupling]] and [[electric power transmission|transmission]] reinforcement in a future European energy system constrained to reduce [[carbon dioxide equivalent|carbon]] emissions by 95%.  The PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30 model captures the [[energy demand management|demand-side management]] potential of [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEV) as well as the role that [[power-to-gas]], long-term [[thermal energy storage]], and related technologies can play.  Results indicate that BEVs can smooth the daily variations in solar power while the remaining technologies smooth the [[wiktionary:synoptic|synoptic]] and seasonal variations in both demand and renewable supply.  Substantial [[wiktionary:buildout|buildout]] of the electricity grid is required for a least-cost configuration.  More generally, such a system is both feasible and affordable.  The underlying datasets are available from [[Zenodo]].&lt;ref name="brown-etal-2018-synergies"&gt;

TEMOA stands for Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis.  The software is being developed by the Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, [[North Carolina State University]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], USA.  The project runs a website and a forum.  The [[source code]] is hosted on [[GitHub]].  The model is programmed in [[Pyomo]], an optimization components library written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].  TEMOA can be used with any solver that [[Pyomo]] supports, including the open source [[GLPK]] solver.  TEMOA uses [[version control]] to publicly archive [[source code]] and [[Data (computing)|datasets]] and thereby enable third-parties to verify all published modeling work.&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"&gt;

TEMOA classes as a modeling framework and is used to conduct analysis using a bottom-up, technology rich energy system model.  The model objective is to minimize the system-wide cost of energy supply by deploying and utilizing energy technologies and commodities over time to meet a set of [[wiktionary:exogenous|exogenously]] specified end-use demands.&lt;ref name="hunter-etal-2013"&gt;

== Programming components ==

=== Component models ===

A number of technical component models are now also open source.  While these component models do not constitute systems models aimed at public policy development (the focus of this page), they nonetheless warrant a mention.  Component models can be linked or otherwise adapted into these broader initiatives.
* Sandia photovoltaic array performance model&lt;ref name="king-etal-2004"&gt;

A number of electricity auction models have been written in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]], [[AMPL]], [[MathProg]], and other languages.{{efn|
[[MathProg]] is a subset of [[AMPL]].  It is sometimes possible to convert an AMPL model into MathProg without much effort.

=== Open solvers ===

Many projects rely on a [[Linear programming|pure linear]] or [[Mixed integer program|mixed integer]] solver to perform classical optimization, constraint satisfaction, or some mix of the two.  While there are several open source solver projects, the most commonly deployed solver is [[GLPK]].  GLPK has been adopted by [[#Calliope|Calliope]], [[#ETEM|ETEM]], [[#ficus|ficus]], [[#OSeMOSYS|OSeMOSYS]], [[#SWITCH|SWITCH]], and [[#TEMOA|TEMOA]].  Another alternative is the Clp solver.&lt;ref name="clp-homepage"&gt;
{{cite web

 | access-date = 2017-04-23
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Proprietary solvers outperform open source solvers by a considerable margin (perhaps ten-fold), so choosing an open solver will limit performance in terms of both speed and memory consumption.&lt;ref name="koch-etal-2011"&gt;

In [[astronomy]], the '''Ostriker–Peebles criterion''', named after its discoverers [[Jeremiah Ostriker]] and [[Jim Peebles]], describes the formation of barred [[galaxy|galaxies]].&lt;ref name=gd-pup&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=01yNf7mipb0C&amp;lpg=PA374&amp;ots=p8wf-UJBte&amp;dq=Ostriker-Peebles%20criterion&amp;pg=PA374#v=onepage&amp;q=Ostriker-Peebles%20criterion&amp;f=false |title=Galactic Dynamics |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |access-date=2 September 2016 |date=1987 |first1=James |last1=Binney |first2=Scott |last2=Tremaine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rotating disc of a spiral galaxy, consisting of stars and solar systems, may become unstable in a way that the stars in the outer parts of the "arms" are released from the galaxy system, resulting in the collapse of the remaining stars into a bar-shaped galaxy. This occurs in approximately 1/3 of the known spiral galaxies.

Based on the first kinetic energy component ''T'' and the total gravitational energy ''W'', a galaxy will become barred when &lt;math&gt;\frac{T}{W} &gt; 0.15&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=gd-pup/&gt;

==Nature of linguistics==

Linguistics can be described as all of the following:

* An [[academic discipline]] – a body of knowledge given to—or received by—a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
* A [[Fields of science|field of science]]  – a widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, embodying its own terminology, nomenclature, and [[scientific journal]]s.
**A [[social science]]  – a field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human societies related to the languages they speak.

==== Subfields, by linguistic structures studied ====
Sub-fields of structure-focused linguistics include:

* [[Phonetics]] – study of the physical properties of speech (or signed) production and perception
* [[Phonology]] – study of sounds (or signs) as discrete, abstract elements in the speaker's mind that distinguish meaning
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] – study of internal structures of words and how they can be modified
* [[Syntax]] – study of how words combine to form grammatical [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s
* [[Semantics]] – study of the meaning of words ([[lexical semantics]]) and fixed word combinations ([[phraseology]]), and how these combine to form the [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]s of sentences
* [[Pragmatics]] – study of how [[utterance]]s are used in [[speech acts|communicative acts]] – and the role played by context and nonlinguistic knowledge in the transmission of meaning
* [[Discourse analysis]] – analysis of language use in [[Text (literary theory)|texts]] (spoken, written, or signed)
* [[Linguistic typology]] – comparative study of the similarities and differences between language structures in the world's languages.

'''Paleoradiology''' (ancient radiology) is the study of [[archeology|archaeological]] remains through the use of [[Radiography|radiographic]] techniques, such as [[X-ray]], [[CT scan|CT]] (computer tomography) and [[X-ray microtomography|micro-CT]] scans.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chhem|first=Rethy|date=2004|title=Paleoradiology: current status and future challenges|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/docview/235996145?pq-origsite=summon|journal=Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal|volume=55|pages=198–199|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is predominately used by archaeologists and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] to examine [[mummy|mummified]] remains due to its non-invasive nature.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Paleoradiologists can discover post-mortem damage to the body, or any artefacts buried with them, while still keeping the remains intact. Radiological images can also contribute evidence about the person's life, such as their age and cause of death. The first recorded use of paleoradiology (although not by that name) was in 1896, just a year after the Rōntgen radiograph was first produced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although this method of viewing ancient remains is advantageous due to its non-invasive manner, many radiologists lack expertise in archeology and very few radiologists can identify ancient diseases which may be present.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Techniques ==

=== CT ===
{{Main|CT scan}}
CT scans are most commonly used in paleoradiological studies because they can create images of soft tissue, organs and body cavities of mummified remains without performing an invasive and damaging autopsy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Heidi|last2=Torres|first2=William E.|last3=Ernst|first3=Randy D.|date=2002|title=Paleoradiology: Advanced CT in the Evaluation of Nine Egyptian Mummies|journal=RadioGraphics|volume=22|issue=2|pages=377–385|doi=10.1148/radiographics.22.2.g02mr13377|pmid=11896227|issn=0271-5333}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enables archaeologists and anthropologists to digitally unwrap the remains and reveal what they contain. CT scanners create these images by taking multiple radiographic planes (or cuts) of the body at different angles which records the layers of different structures in the remains. This differs from typical [[Radiography|radiographic scans]] (X-rays) where all the structural layers are documented in one image, which can create shadows and therefore limit their accuracy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brothwell|first=D|last2=Chhem|first2=R|date=2008|title=Paleoradiology Imaging Mummies and Fossils|url=https://link-springer-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-48833-0.pdf|journal=|publisher=Springer|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-48833-0|via=|isbn=978-3-540-48832-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

There are several main viewing techniques used in CT imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/neuroradiology/image-acquisition/the-basics|title=The Basics - Neuroradiology|publisher=University of Wisconsin|date=2018|website=sites.google.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Axial Imaging: images that are taken from transverse planes, cutting across the body. This provides information about the chest, abdomen and pelvic area of the body, as well as the cranium.
* Sagittal Imaging: images taken from the left or right sides of the body. This gives a greater indication of the length of fractures found on the remains. Together with axial imaging it can create a greater depth of visual understanding of the interior of the body.
* Coronal Imaging: images are taken from the back to the front of the body. This can provide a more accurate indication of the presence of organs in the chest cavity (e.g. the heart).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:The Wormian Inca bone.png|thumb|A 3D image of the skull of an Incan mummy]]
After these different views of the remains have been obtained, it is possible to create a three-dimensional reconstruction of the body. This brings into focus details which may have been missed on the axial imagining. [[Algorithm]] manipulation is used to create the rotational 3D images.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In paleoradiology, the 3D images provide a greater understanding of the remains themselves. For example, in 2002, a study of nine Egyptian mummies found that by using the 3D reconstructions they could see the preservation of soft tissues, such as the penis on one male body and braided hair on female remains. The 3D modelling also illustrated discrepancies between the remains, as some had their internal organs removed while others had not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Due to their ability to take multiple planes of the remains, CT scans are able to virtually 'fly through' the body to assess internal composition and cavities.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cosmacini|first=P|last2=Piacentini|first2=P|date=2008|title=Notes on the history of the radiological study of Egyptian mummies: from X-rays to new imaging techniques|url=https://link-springer-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/content/pdf/10.1007/s11547-008-0280-7.pdf|journal=La Radiologia Medica|volume=113|issue=5|pages=615–626|doi=10.1007/s11547-008-0280-7|pmid=18523844|via=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques are commonly used for diagnostic scans such as [[colonoscopy]] and [[bronchoscopy]], and the same method is applied to ancient remains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This enables researchers to digitally look through the remains from the top down, as though they were watching a short video of footage from the interior of the body. The technique presents observable data from the hollow cavities in the chest and abdomen regions. It can demonstrate whether there are internal organs present or if, in the case of Egyptian mummies, linen has been packed to maintain the body shape of the remains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Micro-CT ====
{{Main|Micro-CT}}Micro-CT is a specialised form of CT scan used to create images with pixels in micrometres. These images are frequently used for bone density examinations and produce greater detail for images of bony structures. This radiology technique is often used to examine the teeth from mummified remains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chhem|first=Rethy K.|date=2006-06-08|title=Paleoradiology: imaging disease in mummies and ancient skeletons|journal=Skeletal Radiology|volume=35|issue=11|pages=803–804|doi=10.1007/s00256-006-0144-y|pmid=16847646|issn=0364-2348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early use (1895&amp;ndash;1970)==
[[File:Mummified cats.jpg|thumb|Two mummified Egyptian cats with a radiograph of the cat on the left|alt=]]
Radiographs, or X-rays, have been used to study and observe ancient remains since their invention by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] in 1895. This early form of X-ray, sometimes known as Röntgenograms, was immediately used by physicists, anthropologists, anatomists and archaeologists as shown below.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boni|first=Thomas|last2=Chhem|first2=Rethy|date=2004|title=History of paleoradiology: early published literature, 1896-1921|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/docview/235982587/fulltext/E876D2B50A9948B1PQ/1?accountid=14757|journal=Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal|volume=55|issue=4|pages=203–210|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* 1896; Carl Georg Walter Koenig, a German physicist, took images of an Egyptian child mummy as well as an Egyptian mummified cat. Fourteen images were taken using a very early form of X-ray, which Koenig realised could be used for more than just medical purposes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckett|first=Ronald G.|date=2014-02-28|title=Paleoimaging: a review of applications and challenges|journal=Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology|volume=10|issue=3|pages=423–436|doi=10.1007/s12024-014-9541-z|pmid=24682794|issn=1547-769X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1897; [[Albert Londe]], a French physicist, took radiographic images of an Egyptian mummy. From these images he was able to determine the presence of artefacts placed in the mummy's wrappings, such as decorative jewellery on the body (e.g. rings), as well as the approximate bone age of the remains by examining the growth plates. Londe’s thorough examination of the pictures demonstrated how ancient remains could be studied without damaging the wrappings and body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* 1898; Charles Lester Leonard and Stewart Culin conducted a radiographic examination of a [[Moche culture|Mochica mummy]] (Peruvian mummy). The mummy had been tightly wrapped and was left unopened to preserve its integrity. Leonard determined that the body was of a child who had been decorated in beads before burial.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* 1901&amp;ndash;1902; [[Dragutin Gorjanović-Kramberger|Karl Gorjanovic-Kramberger]] took images of Palaeolithic skeletons found in Croatia. By comparing the X-rays of the jaw of these remains with X-rays from a modern man he was able to determine differences between the two. The X-ray of the Palaeolithic jaw was also used to measure the length of the teeth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Tutankhamunxray.jpg|thumb|An X-ray of Tutankhamun's skull, the arrow pointing to a possible cause of death]]

* 1905; [[Heinrich Albers-Schönberg|Heinrich Ernst Albers-Schoenberg]] used the radiological method to examine an Egyptian mummy. He discovered that there was a substance in the thorax and pelvis which had most likely been placed there for mummification purposes. He was also able to determine the perseveration of soft tissues around the nose and mouth as well as details within the skull and the state of the spine, which was wholly intact.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* 1912; [[Grafton Elliot Smith|Sir Grafton Elliot Smith]] examined the mummy of Egyptian pharaoh [[Thutmose IV|Thutmosis IV]] and was able to suggest an approximate bone age from these images. He recommended in his publication on the mummy that the use of radiology would be able to provide greater detail to the study of the remains in the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* 1921; F. Salomon studied a Peruvian mummy using X-rays, determining the bone age and the bone structure of the remains. He discovered that the remains were of a child around 2&amp;ndash;3 years old, and bone structure was at a normal developmental stage for this age.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*1933; X-ray imaging was used on Egyptian pharaoh [[Amenhotep I]] by Douglas Derry to discover the age of death. It was approximated to be 40&amp;ndash;50 based on the wear and condition of the teeth. Derry also noted post-mortem damage to the body, which has been attributed to grave robbers, as well as amulets and beads used to decorate the remains during mummification.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*1968; A portable X-ray machine was used to examine the mummy of [[Tutankhamun]] in his tomb in the [[Valley of the Kings]] by researcher R. G. Harrison. These images indicated an age of death of around 18&amp;ndash;20 years based on bone age from a study of the limb lengths, as well as tooth analysis. The rumoured cause of death of tuberculosis was also ruled out during this study. A new hypothesis was formed that Tutankhamun died because of blunt force trauma to the head, due to a depressed fracture found on the skull.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Current use in archaeology ==
CT scans are the most common radiological technique used in modern archaeology due to their ability to provide more detailed information about ancient remains (such as soft tissue and blood vessels) and to produce 3D images by taking layers of different angled pictures. Archaeologists are able to collect data such as age, sex, the cause of death, socioeconomic status, mummification and burial practices by analysing the CT images. The images can also reveal whether the remains were subject to ancient diseases or post-mortem damage.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although paleoradiology practices are used on preserved remains such as European [[Bog body|bog bodies]] and frozen bodies from the High Andes, they are more frequently documented in the analysis of Egyptian mummified remains.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boni|first=Thomas|last2=Chhem|first2=Rethy|date=2004|title=Diagnostic paleoradiology of mummified tissue: interpretation and pitfalls|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/docview/236112998?pq-origsite=summon|journal=Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal|volume=55|issue=4|pages=218–227|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Egyptology ===
[[File:Statue Paramesses Munich.JPG|thumb|Statue of Paramesses (later known as Ramesses I), pharaoh of Egypt during the 20th dynasty of New Kingdom Egypt]]
CT scans are used in [[Egyptology]] to gain insight into mummified bodies without risking damage to the integrity of the remains. Hoffman's recent study of nine Egyptian remains discovered new information regarding the mummification practices of Egyptians. The typical process of [[Mummification in Ancient Egypt|mummification]], as written by [[Herodotus]], involves the removal of the four major internal organs (liver, intestines, lungs and stomach) and placement of them in four [[Canopic jar|canopic jars]]. The heart is removed, embalmed and placed back into the body as it is an important feature in the journey to the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian afterlife]]. However, Hoffman discovered that this was not the case in all mummies. Through analysis of CT-produced 3D images, the "fly-through" technique and a combination of axial and coronal images, it was discovered that four of the remains had not had their internal organs removed and in another four the heart could not be identified.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hoffman suggests this may be due to socioeconomic differences between the mummies during the time they were alive. CT scans were further used in Hoffman's study to potentially identify one of the remains as [[Ramesses I]], a Pharaoh during [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom Egypt]]. It was found that the mummification practices of this particular body were in conjunction with those typically used during the New Kingdom period, as images showed rolled linen placed inside the body in order to preserve its shape. The mummy's arms were also found to be placed across the chest as a symbol of nobility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Imaging done by Rethy Chhem, in 2004, was able to correct a diagnosis of Ramesses II from X-rays done in 1976. The incorrect diagnosis had been of [[ankylosing spondylitis]], a form of arthritis. However, Chhem perceived that the pharaoh actually had [[diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis]], a calcification of the joints causing ligaments to attach to the spine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The CT images provided a clearer and more detailed image of the spine when compared with the early X-rays. This enabled the researchers to provide a greater insight into diseases found in ancient remains and achieve a more accurate diagnosis. 

A recent CT scan of Tutankhamun in 2006 was able to provide evidence against the 'homicide theory'.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A depression fracture noted on the skull from X-rays taken 30 years previously was found to be a post-mortem injury rather than a cause of death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The hole in the head had been created in order to continue the embalming process of mummification.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This CT investigation was also able to confirm Tutankhamun's age of death as nineteen and disprove the idea that the young pharaoh had suffered from [[scoliosis]]; rather the bend in his spine was from additional post-mortem damage to the body.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

== Disadvantages ==
Although the information and evidence gathered by radiological imaging of ancient remains have been largely beneficial to the fields of archaeology and anthropology, not all of the information can be considered accurate due to the lack of radiologists who specialise in [[paleopathology]]. Instead, to obtain the most information from CT or X-ray images a team must meet to discuss the findings (e.g. for a skeletal study of the remains, an orthopaedic surgeon, bone pathologist and musculoskeletal radiologist would meet).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Another disadvantage to this technique is the low contrast resolution. The researcher may be unable to determine a difference between soft tissue and artefacts left from the embalming process. Due to the decomposed state of some of the mummified remains, it can also be difficult to distinguish internal organs due to shrinkage and a lack of preservation. Post-mortem injuries and damage to the body can also hinder the ability of radiological scans to provide accurate information for researchers. For example, in frozen remains, there can difficulty when differentiating whether a CT suggests the body has air-inflated lung tissue or if there is frozen fluid in the lungs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

Paleoradiology is informative in its ability to assist in determining the age of death of the remains, however, this is not always completely accurate or available information. In a sample of bog bodies, 35% were not able to be identified with any age group and 30% could not be sex determined. A radiological study of an iceman was only able to produce an estimate of 40&amp;ndash;50 years at age of death. In order to achieve a more accurate time frame, the body would have to be subject to an autopsy or similar physical assessment which would cause irreversible damage to the remains.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another disadvantage of paleoradiology is the difficulty in transporting the equipment or the artefact/remains to spaces where the images can be taken.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eppenberger|first=Patrick E.|last2=Cavka|first2=Mislav|last3=Habicht|first3=Michael E.|last4=Galassi|first4=Francesco M.|last5=Rühli|first5=Frank|date=2018-06-20|title=Radiological findings in ancient Egyptian canopic jars: comparing three standard clinical imaging modalities (x-rays, CT and MRI)|journal=European Radiology Experimental|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/s41747-018-0048-3|issn=2509-9280|pmc=6008346|pmid=29951641}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2005 the mummy of Tutankhamun was imaged using a CT-scanner which had to be brought from the [[Cairo Museum]] to [[tomb KV62]] in the [[Valley of the Kings]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawass|first=Zahi|date=2013|title=The Death of Tutankhamun|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/docview/1469896500?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:summon&amp;accountid=14757|journal=International Journal on Humanistic Ideology|volume=6|issue=1|pages=13–27|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the fragile state of the remains which were unable to be removed from the climate-controlled tomb. In this study, funding came from  a five-year grant from the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]], which was aided by the donation of a Siemens CT-scanner by the [[National Geographic Society]],&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; however typically funding for research can be problematic as equipment is costly and there may not be sufficient interest to prompt donations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35101">The '''Pevsner Architectural Guides''' are a series of [[guide book]]s to the [[architecture]] of Great Britain and Ireland. Begun in the 1940s by the art historian [[Sir Nikolaus Pevsner]], the 46 volumes of the original '''Buildings of England''' series were published between 1951 and 1974. The series was then extended to [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]] in the late 1970s. The Irish guides are incomplete as of autumn 2016. Most of the English volumes have had second editions, chiefly by other authors.

The final Scottish volume, ''Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire'', was published in autumn 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://issuu.com/yalebooks/docs/pevsner_newsletter_2015-16 |title=Pevsner Architectural Guides: Newsletter |volume=2015/16 |date=2015 |publisher=Yale University Press |accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This completed the series' coverage of [[Great Britain]] in the 65th anniversary year of its inception.

==Origin and research methods==
After moving to [[Great Britain]] from his native [[Germany]] in the 1930s, Nikolaus Pevsner found that the study of [[architectural history]] had little status in academic circles, and that the amount of information available, especially to travellers wanting to inform themselves about the architecture of a particular district, was limited. He conceived a project to write a series of comprehensive county guides to rectify this, and gained the backing of [[Allen Lane]], founder of [[Penguin Books]], for whom he had written his ''Outline of European Architecture''.

Work on the series began in 1945. Lane employed two part-time assistants, both [[German people|German]] refugee art historians, who prepared notes for Pevsner from published sources. Pevsner spent the academic holidays touring the country to make personal observations and to carry out local research, before writing up the finished volumes. The first volume was published in 1951. 

Pevsner wrote 32 of the books himself and ten with collaborators, with a further four of the original series written by others: the two Gloucestershire volumes by David Verey, and the two volumes on Kent by [[John Newman (architectural historian)|John Newman]]. Newman is the only author in the series to have written a volume and revised it three times.

Since Pevsner's death, work has continued on the series, with several volumes now in their third revision, and three in their fourth editions.

==Content of the volumes==
The books are compact and intended to meet the needs of both specialists and the general reader. Each contains an extensive introduction to the architectural history and styles of the area, followed by a town-by-town — and in the case of larger settlements, street-by-street — account of individual buildings. These are often grouped under the heading ''Perambulation'', as Pevsner intended the books to be used as the reader was walking about the area. The guides offer both detailed coverage of the most notable buildings and notes on lesser-known and [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular]] buildings; all building types are covered but there is a particular emphasis on churches and public buildings. Each volume has a central section with several dozen pages of photographs, originally in black and white, though colour illustrations have featured in revised volumes published by [[Yale University Press]] since 2003.

===Boundaries===
The boundaries of each volume do not follow a uniform pattern and have evolved with revisions and expansions. The original intention&lt;ref name="Cherry"&gt;Cherry (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; was to maintain whatever boundaries were current at time of writing; in the first years of the survey these were the [[Historic counties of England|traditional counties]] of England. However boundary changes to the London area in 1965 and the rest of England in 1974 meant that this was no longer practicable. As such there are now many variants: ''Cumbria'', for example, covers the modern [[non-metropolitan county]] – excepting the district of [[Sedbergh]] which although in modern [[Cumbria]] is included in the volume covering the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. Conversely, the [[Furness]] area – geographically in Cumbria but traditionally in [[Lancashire]] – is included, having been omitted from the predecessor volume, ''Cumberland and Westmorland''.  

The six volumes currently covering London collectively represent the 32 [[London boroughs]] plus the [[City of London|City]], which constitute the modern [[Greater London]] region, rather than earlier divisions. The entire volume on [[Middlesex]] was an early casualty of this rearrangement, as are parts of the revised volumes covering [[Surrey]], [[Essex]] and [[Kent]]. The forthcoming ''Birmingham and the Black Country'' volume covers the area bounded by the modern [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] metropolitan county, but minus the Metropolitan Borough of [[Coventry]] and the rural part of [[Metropolitan Borough of Solihull]]. These appear in the revised ''Warwickshire'' volume, despite no longer being in that county. Hence ''Warwickshire'' now follows the boundary of neither the [[Warwickshire|traditional]] nor the modern county.

''The Buildings of Scotland'' similarly features hybrid divisions, with volumes such as ''Fife'' and ''Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire'' reflecting their traditional county boundaries whilst ''Highland and Islands'' corresponds to the modern counterparts. ''The Buildings of Ireland'' has so far broadly corresponded to the traditional [[provinces of Ireland]] and is blind to '[[Irish border|the Border]]' between the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. ''The Buildings of Wales'' largely follows the post-1974 divisions.

===Volumes in print and their editions===
The list below is of the volumes that are currently in print – dates in brackets indicate forthcoming editions. 

Since 1962, the guides have undergone a gradual programme of updating to reflect architectural-history scholarship and to include significant new buildings. Pevsner left virtually all the revisions to others, acting as supervisor only. He ultimately revised only two of his original editions alone: ''London 1: The Cities of London and Westminster'' (1962) and ''Cambridgeshire'' (1970). Both were later revised again by others. To date, the oldest wholly unrevised volume is ''Yorkshire: The North Riding'' (1966). Additionally, readers looking for information on [[West Sussex]] will have to consult Ian Nairn's 1965 text, whilst those wishing to read about the architecture of the [[Black Country]] must refer to the 1966 text of ''Warwickshire'' pending a new volume covering that area. ''Staffordshire'' (1974) is the only other volume currently issued in its unrevised first edition.

Until 1953, all volumes were published in paperback only, after which both hardback and paperback versions were issued.  The revision of ''London: 1'' in 1962 was the first volume to be issued in hardback alone, and no further paperbacks were issued after 1964.  Until 1970 volumes bore a sequential &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt; reference number, with ''Cornwall'' being &lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt;1.  The last volume to be so numbered was ''Gloucestershire 2: The Vale and the Forest of Dean'' (&lt;small&gt;BE&lt;/small&gt;41).  Thereafter [[ISBN]]s identify each volume. Beginning in 1983, a larger format was introduced, and all subsequent new editions have been issued in this format. Volumes revised pre-1983 have been reprinted in the original, smaller format (marked with an asterisk in the table below). All editions are now published by [[Yale University Press]].

Where revisions have been spread over more than one volume, the preceding edition remains in print until the whole area has been revised. Editions which have been partly superseded in this way are marked ‡.

===Notes===
{{notelist|2}}

===City Guides===
The first of the paperback City Guides, covering Manchester, appeared in 2001. It featured a new format with integrated colour illustrations. In most cases the City Guides have preceded a revision of the county volume in which they are located, although they do go into greater detail than the county volumes and have more illustrations. Thus  the Birmingham guide completely supersedes the central Birmingham section of the ''Warwickshire'' volume, which is now almost fifty years old. Two of the guides, covering ''Newcastle and Gateshead'' and ''Hull'', are more recent than the hardback editions for the surrounding counties, and therefore update as well as expand the coverage of those cities. This series appears to be on a hiatus, with no new volumes published since 2010 and none confirmed as in planning.

*''Bath'' (2003) (Michael Forsyth) {{ISBN|978-0-300-10177-5}}
*''Birmingham'' (2005) (Andy Foster) {{ISBN|978-0-300-10731-9}}

*''Sheffield'' (2004) (Ruth Harman and John Minnis) {{ISBN|978-0-300-10585-8}}

Two supplementary works – thus far the only of their type – were published in 1998, one covering London's City Churches and the other the Docklands area (see ''London Docklands'' in Superseded Volumes below). Both were issued in the format of the main series rather than the City Guides. However, unlike the Docklands edition which represented preliminary work for an expanded main volume, the City Churches volume augmented the text in ''London 1: The City'', published the previous year. The continued development of the Docklands area meant that the volume was superseded when ''London 5: East'' was published seven years later, but the City Churches volume remains current and was reissued by Yale in 2002.

*''London City Churches'' (1998) (Simon Bradley) {{ISBN|978-0-300-09655-2}}

==Buildings of Scotland==
The series continued under Pevsner's founding editorship into Scotland. The format is largely similar; however, only ''Lothian'' was published in the original small volume style. One noticeable difference in some of the Scottish series is a greater subdivision of the main gazetteer (''e.g.'' in ''Argyll and Bute'' mainland Argyll has separate gazetteer from its islands, and Bute similarly is treated on its own). Unlike ''The Buildings of England'', none of the Scottish volumes adopts a hierarchy of ecclesiastical buildings, instead grouping them together. As with the English revisions, several of the volumes are the work of many contributors. The series was completed with ''Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire'', published in November 2016.

The volumes on Glasgow and Edinburgh are, with Dublin (see below) the only Pevsner volumes outside London to focus exclusively on a city. These volumes should not be confused with the City Guide format (see above).

*''Stirling and Central Scotland'' (2002) {{ISBN|978-0-300-09594-4}} (John Gifford and Frank Arneil Walker)

==Buildings of Wales==
The series has also been extended to Wales, and was completed with the issue of ''Gwynedd'' in 2009 (although this initial survey had taken seven years longer than Pevsner's first complete survey of England). Only the first volume, ''Powys'' (edited by Richard Haslam, and published in 1979) appeared in the original small format style; and this volume has now been superseded by a revised large-format edition, published in 2013. This is the first (and to date only) guide outside ''The Buildings of England'' series to be revised.

==Buildings of Ireland==
The Irish series is incomplete, with only four volumes being published between 1979 and the present day. Research for several of the intended volumes has not yet begun.

*''Belfast, Antrim and County Down'' (in preparation)&lt;ref name="Mackay"&gt;Mackay (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

*''West Leinster: the Counties of Kildare, Laois and Offaly'' (in preparation)&lt;ref name="Mackay" /&gt;

==Treatment of bridges==
A number of bridges connect areas covered by different volumes. However there is no single approach for which volume should include the structure in its main gazetteer. In some cases, one volume refers the reader to the other, and in other cases only a few lines appear in one volume and a fuller entry appears in the other. In a very few cases (listed below) a full entry appears in both volumes.

==Superseded and unpublished volumes==
The revision of the series has rendered some original volumes obsolete, usually as the area of coverage has changed. For example, the county of [[Cumbria]] was created after the publication of ''Cumberland and Westmorland'' and ''North Lancashire'', leading to the merger of material from both volumes in a single volume ''Cumbria'', a revision with a new geographical focus.
To date the following volumes have been entirely superseded:

*''Cumberland and Westmorland'' (1967)
*''London: the Cities of London and Westminster'' (1957, rev. 1962 and 1973)
*''London, except the Cities of London and Westminster'' (1952)
*''London Docklands'' (1998) (with Elizabeth Williamson)
*''Middlesex'' (1951)
*''North Lancashire'' (1969)
*''South Lancashire'' (1969)
*''Suffolk'' (1961, rev. Enid Radcliffe 1974)
*''Yorkshire: The West Riding'' (1959, rev. Enid Radcliffe 1967)

In addition, two volumes, ''North Devon'' and ''South Devon'' (1952) were superseded by a single volume covering the entire county. Parts of the original ''Hampshire &amp; the Isle of Wight'' and ''Yorkshire: the West Riding'' volumes have been superseded by revised volumes.

In some published volumes and in advance publicity, certain titles were announced which were ultimately never published. A number of factors accounted for this, including the readiness of parts of the text covering certain areas and the anticipated size of the volumes. Unpublished titles included:

*''Argyll, Bute and Stirling''&lt;ref name="Cherry"&gt;Cherry (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ayrshire, Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire''&lt;ref&gt;Announced in the Dumfries and Galloway volume (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Dublin: City and County''&lt;ref name="Cherry" /&gt;
*''London III'' &lt;ref&gt;Announced in the first edition of the West Kent volume (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;
*''South Strathclyde''&lt;ref&gt;Announced in the Fife volume (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related works==
In 1995 Penguin, in conjunction with [[English Heritage]], released a publication based on the guides entitled ''Looking at Buildings''. Focusing on the East Riding of Yorkshire volume, Pevsner's text was adapted as an introduction, with a greater number of illustrations than the main guides. No further print publications were issued, however the title survives as an introductory website to architectural terms and selected buildings which feature the Pevsner guides[http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/index.html].

In 1995 a [[CD-ROM]] entitled ''A Compendium of Pevsner's Buildings of England'' was issued by [[Oxford University Press]], designed as a searchable database of the volumes published for England only. A second edition was released in 2005. Bibliographies of the guides themselves were published in 1983, 1998 and 2012 by the [[Penguin Collectors Society]].

In 2016 Yale University Press published three volumes, each serving as an introduction to some of the buildings and the architectural terms mentioned in the text of the guides. Published as ''Pevsner Architectural Guides: Introductions'' these are: an architectural glossary (also available as an [[Mobile app|app]]), a volume focusing on church buildings and another on dwelling houses (including [[vernacular architecture]]).

===Celebratory volumes===
In 1986, Penguin published an anthology from Pevsner's volumes edited by [[Bridget Cherry]] and John Newman, ''The Best Buildings of England'', {{ISBN|0-670-81283-8}}. It has an introduction by Newman assessing Pevsner's aims and methods. In 2001, the Penguin Collectors Society published ''The Buildings of England: a Celebration'', edited by Simon Bradley and Bridget Cherry, fifty years after BE1 was published: it includes twelve essays and a selection of text from the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Buildings of England: a Celebration |first1=Simon |last1=Bradley |first2=Bridget |last2=Cherry |publisher=Penguin Collectors' Society |date=2001 |isbn=978-0952740131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Travels with Pevsner''==
In 1997 the [[BBC]] broadcast a series of documentaries&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00fj1c7 ''Travels with Pevsner'' (BBC site)]&lt;/ref&gt; entitled ''Travels with Pevsner'', in which six writers and broadcasters travelled through a county which had particular significance to them. They revisited buildings mentioned by Pevsner, critically examining his views on them. A further series was broadcast in 1998. John Grundy, who presented the programme on Northumberland, was one of the revisers of that county volume. Both series were accompanied by booklets published by the [[BBC]], describing the buildings featured in the programmes and suggesting others to explore. The counties visited and the travellers were:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8974">'''Philosophy education''' is the practice of [[teaching]] and [[learning]] [[philosophy]] along with the associated scholarly research. It is not [[philosophy of education]], nor the philosophical study of education in general.

== Philosophy education around the world ==
Education in the subject is usually divided into 4 main stages: [[pre-school]] (i.e. pre-primary; e.g. [[kindergarten]]) and [[primary education]] levels (e.g. [[elementary school]]), lower (e.g. [[middle school]]) and upper [[secondary education]] level (e.g. [[high school]]), [[Tertiary education|tertiary (higher) education]] level (e.g. [[college]], [[university]]), and [[post-tertiary education]] level. Sometimes the stage referred to as "post-secondary non-tertiary" is also included (in a fashion similar to the [[ISCED]] levels).
Not all countries provide study of philosophy at all levels and in many the subject is virtually absent from the entire curriculum.

=== English-speaking countries ===
In the United States of America, philosophy is not generally taught at the pre-college level. However, through the movements of [[critical thinking]] and [[Philosophy for Children]] aspects of philosophy teaching have entered the curriculum. In recent years, some in the media have promoted the idea of introducing philosophy to American schools as an antidote to perceived political and societal dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-shammas/for-a-better-society-teac_b_2356718.html|title=For a Better Society, Teach Philosophy in High Schools|last=Shammas|first=Michael|date=2012-12-26|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/teaching-philosophy-in-schools-has-huge-impacts-2015-7|title=Schools are starting to teach kids philosophy—and it's completely changing the way students think|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Canada, philosophy is not generally taught in public schools prior to university. In the United Kingdom it is possible to do A-levels in philosophy.

=== Continental Europe ===
In many other European countries philosophy is part of the high school curriculum, such as for example in [[Austria]], [[Croatia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Poland]], and mainly [[Spain]]. In [[Germany]] the subject ethics has been introduced in more and more parts since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pfister|2010|pp=119–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Croatia the subject ethics can be taken instead of religious education which mainly focuses on Catholic tradition. Spain is the most clear example of a philosophy education. In Secondary school all the students must take a little introduction to ethics, but it is during the sixth form, known there as 'bachillerato', where it is compulsory to take philosophy and citizenship in the first course, as well as history of philosophy in the second course in order to apply for university or just to get the title. University-level philosophy courses are widespread and are usually thought to have the longest tradition in the subject due to the historical ascription for the invention of philosophy as a separate discipline to the philosophers of Ancient Greece.

=== Africa and the Middle East ===
Philosophy education has a long tradition in some of the Arab states. According to a UNESCO-led poll, philosophy is taught at secondary level in Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Mauritania, Qatar, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia and Yemen. In most Arab countries the subject is taught at university (higher education) level. However, there are exceptions, like Oman and Saudi Arabia, where philosophy is entirely absent at most educational levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=UNESCO Human Security, Democracy and Philosophy Section, Social and Human Sciences Sector  |title=Teaching Philosophy in the Arab Region |publisher=UNESCO Publishing |location=Paris |year=2009 |pages=22, 34–35 |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001852/185218e.pdf |format=PDF |id=SHS/PH/2009/PI/ARB 185218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
Philosophy education is traditionally available in most of Asia since the continent gave birth to the schools of [[Eastern philosophy]]. The 20th and early 21st century saw the increased interest in the field (especially in [[Western philosophy]]) in the Asian continent, with [[India]], [[China]] and especially [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://journals.openedition.org/etudesplatoniciennes/283|title=Contemporary Meaning of Reading Plato in Japan and Asia Surtitre|last=Notomi|first=Noburu|date=|website=Open Edition Journals|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as major contemporary academic and research hubs.{{Request quotation|date=November 2010}} However, broad regional and interstate differences apply.

=== Latin America ===
In [[Brazil]], philosophy is part of the high school curriculum since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Filosofia e Sociologia no Ensino Médio|url=http://portal.mec.gov.br/conselho-nacional-de-educacao/atos-normativos--sumulas-pareceres-e-resolucoes?id=12768|publisher=Ministério da Educação}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical approaches to philosophy education ==
Theoretical questions concerning the teaching of philosophy in school have been debated at least since [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. The modern debate in Germany in the 1970s gave rise to two competing approaches: the more traditional, text-oriented approach by Wulff D. Rehfus and the more modern, dialogue-oriented approach by Ekkehard Martens. Newer approaches have been developed by Karel van der Leeuw and Pieter Mostert as well as Roland W. Henke. A similar divide between [[tradition]]alists and [[modernists]] is to be found in France, with the proponents Jacques Muglioni and Jacqueline Russ on the one side and France Rollin and Michel Tozzi on the other. In Italy, philosophy education is traditionally historically oriented in the sense of [[history of ideas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pfister|2010|pp=137–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Theoretical problems of philosophy education at college and university level are discussed in articles in the journal [[Teaching Philosophy]].

== Didactic methods ==
Among the didactic methods in philosophy are the [[Socratic method]] and [[Hermeneutics]]. The pedagogic side of philosophy teaching is also of note to researchers in the field and philosophers of education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29884">{{Economic anthropology}}
{{Anthropology}}
'''Political Economy''' in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[Historical Materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political Economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Most anthropologists moved away from modes of production analysis typical of structural Marxism, and focused instead on the complex historical relations of class, culture and hegemony in regions undergoing complex colonial and capitalist transitions in the emerging world system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161–85|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political Economy was introduced in American anthropology primarily through the support of [[Julian Steward]], a student of [[Alfred L. Kroeber|Kroeber]]. Steward’s research interests centered on “subsistence” — the dynamic interaction of man, environment, technology, social structure, and the organization of work. This emphasis on subsistence and production - as opposed to exchange - is what distinguishes the Political Economy approach. Steward's most theoretically productive years were from 1946-1953, while teaching at [[Columbia University]].  At this time, Columbia saw an influx of [[World War II]] [[veteran]]s who were attending school thanks to the [[GI Bill]]. Steward quickly developed a coterie of students who would go on to develop Political Economy as a distinct approach in anthropology, including [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Eric Wolf]], [[Eleanor Leacock]], [[Roy Rappaport]], [[Stanley Diamond]], Robert Manners, [[Morton Fried]], [[Robert F. Murphy (anthropologist)|Robert F. Murphy]], and influenced other scholars such as [[Elman Service]], [[Marvin Harris]] and June Nash. Many of these students participated in the Puerto Rico Project, a large-scale group research study that focused on modernization in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Anthropologies and Histories: essays in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutcgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=146–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes. Sahlins' work on hunter-gatherers as the "original affluent society" did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist world-system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"/&gt;

More recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.

==Theory==

===Cultural materialism===
{{main|Cultural materialism (anthropology)}}
Cultural materialism is a research orientation introduced by [[Marvin Harris]] in 1968 (''The Rise of Anthropological Theory''),&lt;ref name=Harris2001a&gt;{{citation |date=2001a |origyear=1968 |author=Harris, Marvin |authorlink=Marvin Harris |title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture |place=Walnut Creek, California |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=0-7591-0132-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUUYN3X18dwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Rise+Anthropological+Theory&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KySLTMqBFI2IvgOjtY0Y&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2010}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-7591-0133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a theoretical paradigm and research strategy. Indeed, it is said to be the most enduring achievement of that work.&lt;ref name=Margolis&gt;{{citation |year=2001 |last=Margolis |first=Maxine L |authorlink=Maxine Margolis |contribution=Introduction |editor=Marvin Harris |title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture |series=2001a |origyear=1968 |page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris subsequently developed a defense of the paradigm in his 1979 book ''Cultural Materialism''.&lt;ref name=Harris2001b&gt;{{citation |date=2001b |origyear=1979 |author=Harris, Marvin |authorlink=Marvin Harris |title=Cultural Materialism: the Struggle for a Science of Culture |edition=Updated |place=Walnut Creek, California |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=0-7591-0134-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Xc9DMbB5KQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22materialism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=meSKTIetFMu8cZOwyMkE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2010}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-7591-0135-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Harris, cultural materialism "is based on the simple premise that human social life is a response to the practical problems of earthly existence".&lt;ref name=Harris2001bpxv&gt;Harris, Marvin (2001b), p.xv&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris' approach was influenced by but distinct from Marx. Harris' method was to demonstrate how particular cultural practices (like the Hindu prohibition on harming cattle) served a materialistic function (such as preserving an essential source of fertilizer from being consumed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Marvin|title=Cows, pigs, wars &amp; witches; the riddles of culture|year=1974|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic behavior has a cultural side which indicates that the works of anthropologists is relevant to economics. The Motivation behind cultural materialism is mainly to show that cultures adapt to the environment they're produced in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Materialism and Institutional Economics|last=Jackson|first=William|publisher=Review of Social Economy|year=1996|isbn=|location=University of York|pages=225–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural Marxism===
{{main|Structural Marxism}}
Structural Marxism was an approach to [[Marxist philosophy]] based on [[structuralism]], primarily associated with the work of the French philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] and his students. It was influential in France during the 1960s and 1970s, and also came to influence philosophers, political theorists and anthropologists outside France during the 1970s. French structuralist Marxism melded Marxist political economy with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Levi-Strauss]]'s [[Structuralism|structural]] methodology, eliminating the human subject, dialectical reason and history in the process. Structural Marxists introduced two major concepts, mode of production and social formation, that allowed for a more prolonged and uneven transition to capitalism than either dependency or World systems theory allowed for.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"/&gt; A [[mode of production]] consisting of producers, non-producers and [[means of production]], combined in a variety of ways, formed the deep structure of a "social formation." A social formation combined (or "articulated") several modes of production, only one of which was dominant or determinant. Primary anthropological theorists of this school included [[Maurice Godelier]], [[Claude Meillassoux]], Emmanuel Terray and Pierre-Philippe Rey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Chris Hann]]|first=[[Keith Hart (anthropologist)|Keith Hart]]|title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=73–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural Marxism arose in opposition to the [[Marxist humanism|humanistic Marxism]] that dominated many western universities during the 1970s. In contrast to Humanistic Marxism, Althusser stressed that Marxism was a [[science]] that examined objective structures.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, L. (1971). Lenin and Philosophy. In ''Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays''. NY: Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural materialism===
Critical influences on Structural Marxism, primarily from the British Marxist historical tradition, included [[E. P. Thompson|E.P. Thompson]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]] and [[Raymond Williams]]. They criticized the functionalist emphasis in Structural Marxism, that neglected individuals in favour of the structural elements of their model. The British school was more interested in class, culture and politics, and placed human subjects at the centre of analysis. Where mode of production analysis was abstract, they focused on people. Where world-systems theory had little to say about the local, the Cultural Materialists began and ended there. Others connected with this school of thought concentrated on issues such as ethnic formation, labor migration, remittances, household formation, food production and the processes of colonialism.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 172"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=172|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The anthropology of pre-capitalist societies ==
[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumbnail|Dobe !Kung men lighting a fire.]]
{{main|Original affluent society}}
As anthropologists embraced "mode of production" analysis in the 1950s, they struggled to adapt its evolutionary model to the groups that they had traditionally worked with. While Marxist analysis was developed to account for capitalist society and its class dynamics, it had little to say about "pre-capitalist" societies, other than to define them by what they were not.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 172"/&gt; One of the first attempts to theorize [[Hunter-gatherer]] society was [[Marshall Sahlins]] ''Stone Age Economics'' (1972) which overturned nineteenth century ideas that characterized life in such societies as "nasty, brutish and short". Sahlins demonstrated that actual existing hunter-gatherers lived in "the original affluent society"; their needs were met with relatively little work leaving them with far more leisure time than western industrial societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chris Hann|first=Keith Hart|title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard B. Lee|Richard B. Lee's]] work amongst the [[ǃKung people|Dobe !Kung]] of Botswana provided a detailed case study of the argument, even in one of the most hostile desert environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Richard B.|title=The Dobe Ju/'hoansi 3rd edition|year=2002|publisher=Wadsworth Thomson|location=Belmont CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second part of Sahlins' book applies Chayanov's theories to develop a theory of a "Domestic mode of production." Given the argument of the "original affluent society" that many of these societies had abundant resources, Sahlins argued that the limit on production was the amount of labour available. Young families with many dependent children had to work harder, whereas older families with mature children and many workers worked much less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Durrenberger|first=Paul|title=A Shower of Rain: Marshall Sahlins's Stone Age Economics Twenty-five years later|journal=Culture &amp; Agriculture|year=1998|volume=20|issue=2/3|pages=103–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final sections developed a theory of reciprocity discussed above.

An alternate model of the Domestic Mode of Production was developed by Eric Wolf, who rejected the evolutionary implications of Sahlins' model and argued that this mode of production should be viewed as the product of developing colonial trade relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=131–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several collections addressing the question of mode of production analysis in classless societies came out in this period, including "''The Anthropology of Pre-Capitalist Societies''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joel Kahn|first=Joseph Llobera|title=The Anthropology of Pre-capitalist Societies|year=1981|publisher=Macmillan|location=Basingstoke}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "''Marxist Analysis and Social Anthropology''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maurice Bloch ed.|title=Marxist analysis and Social Anthropology|year=1975|publisher=Tavistock|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the state==
{{main|State formation}}
Political economists such as [[Morton Fried]], [[Elman Service]], and [[Eleanor Leacock]] took a Marxist approach and sought to understand the origins and development of inequality in human society. Marx and Engels had drawn on the ethnographic work of [[Lewis H. Morgan]], and these authors now extended that tradition. In particular, they were interested in the evolution of social systems over time.

==Colonialism and imperialism==
[[File:Rhodes and Africa from Cairo to Cape Town.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cecil Rhodes, driving force of British imperialism in Africa]]

===Articulated modes of production===
The articulation of modes of production within a single formation was meant to account for the influence of colonialism on lineage modes of production, primarily in the African context. According to Hann and Hart, the short lived success of the theory was that

&lt;blockquote&gt;it produced a version of structural-functionalism at once sufficiently different from the original to persuade English-speakers that they were learning Marxism and similar enough to allow them to retain their customary way of thinking, which had been temporarily discredited by its role in the administration of empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chris Hann|first=Keith Hart|title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===World-systems theory and dependency theory===
{{main|World-systems theory|Dependency theory}}
Dependency Theory arose as a theory in Latin America in reaction to [[modernization theory]]. It argues that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and underdeveloped states to a "core" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "[[World-system]]" and hence poor countries will not follow Rostow's predicted path of modernization. Dependency Theory rejected Rostow's view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and [[structuralism|structures]] of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy and hence unable to change the system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 166"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=166|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immanuel Wallerstein's "world-systems theory" was the version of Dependency Theory that most North American anthropologists engaged with. His theories are similar to Dependency Theory, although he placed more emphasis on the system as system, and focused on the developments of the core rather than periphery. Wallerstein also provided an historical account of the development of capitalism which had been missing from Dependency Theory.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 166"/&gt;

Both versions of Dependency Theory were critiqued throughout the 1970s for the static historical accounts they provided. Their influence was slowly replaced by more dynamic and historically sensitive versions, such as Eric Wolf's "Europe and the People Without History."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=167|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eric Wolf and ''Europe and the people without history''===
{{main|Europe and the people without history}}
[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumbnail|left|16th-century Portuguese (blue) and Spanish (white) trade routes]]
"Europe and the people without history" is history written on a global scale, tracing the connections between communities, regions, peoples and nations that are usually treated as discrete subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book begins in 1400 with a description of the trade routes a world traveller might have encountered, the people and societies they connected, and the civilizational processes trying to incorporate them. From this, Wolf traces the emergence of Europe as a global power, and the reorganization of particular world regions for the production of goods now meant for global consumption. Wolf differs from World Systems theory in that he sees the growth of Europe until the late eighteenth century operating in a tributary framework, and not capitalism. He examines the way that colonial state structures were created to protect tributary populations involved in the silver, fur and slave trades.  Whole new "tribes" were created as they were incorporated into circuits of mercantile accumulation. The final section of the book deals with the transformation in these global networks as a result of the growth of capitalism with the industrial revolution. Factory production of textiles in England, for example transformed cotton production in the American South and Egypt, and eliminated textile production in India. All these transformations are connected in a single structural change. Each of the world's regions are examined in terms of the goods they produced in the global division of labour, as well as the mobilization and migration of whole populations (such as African slaves) to produce these goods. Wolf uses [[labor market segmentation]] to provide a historical account of the creation of ethnic segmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=127–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where World Systems theory had little to say about the periphery, Wolf's emphasis is on the people "without history" (i.e. not given a voice in western histories) and on how they were active participants in the creation of new cultural and social forms emerging in the context of commercial empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Maritime Fur Trade-WorldContext.png|thumbnail|Maritime Fur Trade, 1790-1840.]]
Wolf distinguishes between three modes of production: capitalist, kin-ordered, and tributary. Wolf does not view them as an evolutionary sequence. He begins with capitalism because he argues our understanding of kin-ordered and tributary modes is coloured by our understanding of capitalism. He argues they are not evolutionary precursors of capitalism, but the product of the encounter between the West and the Rest. In the tributary mode, direct producers possess their own means of production, but their surplus production is taken from them through extra economic means. This appropriation is usually by some form of strong or weak state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=131–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the kin-ordered mode of production, social labour is mobilized through kin relations (such as lineages), although his description makes its exact relations with tributary and capitalist modes unclear. The kin mode was further theorized by French structuralist Marxists in terms of 'articulated modes of production.' The kin-ordered mode is distinct again from Sahlins' formulation of the domestic mode of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unfree labour and slavery==
Liberal and neo-liberal market-based societies are predicated upon the concept of "free labour" - workers enter a labour market freely, and enter into contractual relations with employers voluntarily. "Unfree labour" - otherwise known as bond labour, debt bondage, debt peonage, and slavery, are thought to be archaic forms that will be eliminated with capitalist development. Anthropologists working in a wide variety of current situations have documented that the incidence of bonded labour is much greater than capitalist ideology would lead us to expect.&lt;ref name="Brass 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brass|first=Tom|title=Towards a Comparative Political Economy of Unfree Labour: Case Studies and Debates|year=1999|publisher=Frank Cass|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: The first 5,000 years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=349–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Brass argues that unfree labour is not an archaic holdover in today's world, but an active process of deproletarianization of agricultural workers to provide rural agrarian capitalists with cheaper labour. In the constant drive to cheapen the cost of agricultural labour, debt bondage is used to tie workers to specific employers, lower their wages, and extract further unpaid labour from them. He illustrates this process at work in Peru and India.&lt;ref name="Brass 1999"/&gt;

An early study of debt bondage was [[Ann Laura Stoler]]'s ''Capitalism and Confrontation in Sumatra's Plantation Belt, 1870-1979'' (1985). Stoler examined the tobacco plantations of the Deli Maatschappij, one of the most profitable Dutch colonial corporations of the 19th century. The Deli company imported large numbers of Chinese indentured labourers to [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], where they were treated not as employees, but as contractors. As contractors they had to buy all their supplies at inflated prices from the company, take all the risks of cultivation and processing, and finally sell their tobacco to the company at prices it set. They were kept in perpetual debt, unable to change employers, in working conditions that resulted in extraordinarily high death rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoler|first=Ann|title=Capitalism and Confrontation in Sumatra's Plantation Belt, 1870-1979|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Breman extended this analysis of the "Coolie regulation" (which allowed for indentured labour) to the Dutch mining industry in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (Indonesia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Breman|first=Jan|title=Taming the Coolie Beast : Plantation Society and the Colonial Order in Southeast Asia|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery is but one form of unfree (or bound) labour. Structural Marxists sought to theorize it as a mode of production. Claude Meillassoux has refined this approach in his study of pre-colonial African slavery. He analyzed the military and aristocratic systems that organized the capture of slaves and situated it within the politics of the merchants who organized the trade in slaves. His work focuses on the forces at play within a kinship organized polity that define slaves culturally as "anti-kin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meillassoux|first=Claude|title=The Anthropology of Slavery: The Womb of Iron and Gold|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peasant studies and agrarian change==

===Simple commodity production and the peasantry===
{{main|Simple commodity production}}
Simple commodity production (also known as "petty commodity production") is a term coined by [[Frederick Engels]] to describe productive activities under the conditions of what Marx had called the "simple exchange" of [[commodities]], where independent producers such as peasants trade their own products. The use of the word "simple" does not refer to the nature of the producers or of their production, but to the relatively simple and straightforward exchange processes involved. Simple commodity production is compatible with many ''different'' relations of production, ranging from [[self-employment]] where the producer owns his means of production, and family labour, to forms of [[slavery]], [[peonage]], [[indentured labour]], and [[serfdom]].

===Capitalist transitions and agrarian change===
{{main|Anthropology of development}}
Michael Taussig, for example, examined the reactions of peasant farmers in Columbia as they struggled to understand how money could make interest. Taussig highlights that we have [[Commodity fetishism|fetishized]] money. We view money as an active agent, capable of doing things, of growth. In viewing money as an active agent, we obscure the social relationships that actually give money its power. The Columbian peasants, seeking to explain how money could bear interest, turned to folk beliefs like the "baptism of money" to explain how money could grow. Dishonest individuals would have money baptized, which would then become an active agent; whenever used to buy goods, it would escape the till and return to its owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taussig|first=Michael|title=The Genesis of Capitalism Amongst a South American Peasantry: Devil's Labor and the Baptism of Money|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|year=1977|volume=19|issue=2|pages=130–155|doi=10.1017/S0010417500008586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peasant wars of the twentieth century===
Written in 1969 by [[Eric Wolf]], ''Peasant Wars of the Twentieth Century'', is a comparative view of the [[peasant]] [[revolution]]s of [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Algeria]], and [[Cuba]].

===The moral economy of the peasant===
The concept of a [[moral economy]] was first elaborated by English historian [[E.P. Thompson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward P.|title=Customs in Common|year=1991|publisher=New Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was developed further in anthropological studies of other peasant economies. Thompson wrote of the moral economy of the poor in the context of widespread food riots in the English countryside in the late eighteenth century. According to Thompson these riots were generally peaceable acts that demonstrated a common political culture rooted in feudal rights to “set the price” of essential goods in the market. These peasants held that a traditional “fair price” was more important to the community than a “free” market price and they punished large farmers who sold their surpluses at higher prices outside the village while there were still those in need within the village. The notion of a non-capitalist cultural mentalité using the market for its own ends has been linked by others (with Thompson's approval) to subsistence agriculture and the need for subsistence insurance in hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward P.|title=Customs in Common|year=1991|publisher=New Press|location=New York|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cambodiaricefarming1.jpg|thumbnail|Cambodian rice farming]]
The concept was widely popularized in anthropology through the book, "The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia" by [[James C. Scott]] (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=James C.|title=The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|year=1976|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book begins with a telling metaphor of peasants being like a man standing up to his nose in water; the smallest wave will drown him. Similarly, peasants generally live so close to the subsistence line that it takes little to destroy their livelihoods. From this, he infers a set of economic principles that it would be rational for them to live by. It is important to emphasize that this book was not based on fieldwork, and itself proposed a cross-cultural universalistic model of peasant economic behaviour based upon a set of fixed theoretical principles, not a reading of peasant culture. Firstly, he argued that peasants were "risk averse", or, put differently, followed a "safety first" principle. They would not adopt risky new seeds or technologies, no matter how promising, because tried and true traditional methods had demonstrated, not promised, effectiveness. This gives peasants an unfair reputation as "traditionalist" when in fact they are just risk averse. Secondly, Scott argues that peasant society provides "subsistence insurance" for its members to tide them over those occasions when natural or man-made disaster strikes. Although fieldwork has not supported many of Scott's conclusions, the book encouraged a generation of researchers.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9299">The '''''Prebiarum de multorum exemplaribus''''' is a [[Hiberno-Latin]] interrogatory [[florilegium]] of the mid-8th century, written as a [[Dialogue#Literary and philosophical genre|dialogue]] in a series of 93 short questions and answers. The word ''prebiarum'' seems to be a corruption of ''breviarium'',&lt;ref&gt;Joseph F. Kelly, "Scripture and Tradition in the Early Irish Church," ''Scripture, tradition and reason: a study in the criteria of Christian doctrine: essays in honour of Richard P.C. Hanson'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 1988), p. 163 [https://books.google.com/books?id=f0Bj5pWPJgoC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=Prebiarum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Prebiarum&amp;f=false  online.] ''Multorum'' is also given incorrectly as ''multorium''.&lt;/ref&gt; though the work is not a [[breviary]] in the usual sense; the title is not customarily translated into English, but would mean something like "A Breviary of Examples from Many Sources." The [[medieval Latin|Latin]] dialogue makes use of [[Triads of Ireland|triads]], a tripartite form of expression characteristic of [[early Irish literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary F. Wack and Charles D. Wright, "A New Latin Source for the Old English 'Three Utterances' Exemplum," in ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991), vol. 20, p. 197 [https://books.google.com/books?id=21xhHS5eBdsC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=Prebiarum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Prebiarum&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Its subject matter is [[exegesis|exegetical]] or [[Didactic literature|didactic]]; that is, it seeks to explain or teach, often through an enumeration of its points.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin Wright, ''The Irish Tradition in Old English Literature'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Prebiarum'' is mostly of [[comparative literature|comparative]] interest, and has been dismissed as an example of texts, often written by [[Christian monasticism|monks]], that "display a vulgarization of religious subjects, treating them as popular [[trivia]], meant more for fun and humour than for any overly didactic, serious purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Liam Ethan Felsen, "Medieval Monks: Funnier Than You Thought," in ''Misconceptions about the Middle Ages'' (Routledge, 2008), p. 72 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ljrw9swM1fAC&amp;pg=PT82&amp;dq=Prebiarum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Prebiarum&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; This characterization may represent an elitist view not evident to all readers of the ''Prebiarum''. Like other [[catechism|catechetical]] Hiberno-Latin writings, the ''Prebiarum'' with its modest aims seems intended to help ordinary people with [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. McNally, ''Scriptores Hiberniae Minores Pars I'', Corpus Christianorum 108B (Turnhout, 1973), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The text's 20th-century editor regarded the ''Prebiarum'' as "a [[handbook]] useful to the [[itinerant preacher]], the teacher, or even to the [[spiritual father]] charged with the obligation of giving spiritual conferences or instructions. … In no sense is the work sophisticated; it is rather simple, direct, even somewhat archaic in spirit."&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources, analogues, and intellectual context==
Despite its 8th-century date, the ''Prebiarum'' is disconnected from the intellectual and [[theology|theological]] preoccupations of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] and represents a more "primitive state of biblical learning." Its methods cannot be said to derive from the [[exegesis|exegetical literature]] of 7th-century Ireland, nor from the [[Northumbria#Culture|Northumbrian tradition]] of [[Bede]].&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a collection of miscellaneous snippets from various sources (''[[collectanea]]''), the ''Prebiarum'' draws on [[Church Fathers|patristic]] sources such as [[Jerome]], [[Augustine]], and [[Gregory the Great|Gregory]], as well as medieval writings of obscure origin. The ''Prebiarum'' is similar to the ''[[Joca monarchorum]]'' ("Monks' jests") and ''Collectanaea pseudo-Bedae'' (sometimes noted as ''[[List of works by Bede|Collectanaea Bedae]]''). The author or compiler of the ''Prebiarum'' drew on at least three works by [[Isidore of Seville]], the ''[[Etymologiae]]'', ''De ecclesiasticis officiis'', and the ''Sententiae'', along with the Irish [[pseudepigraph]]ical ''Liber de numeris''.&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' p. 155; Claudia di Sciacca, ''Finding the Right Words: Isidore's'' Synonyma ''in Anglo-Saxon England'' (University of Toronto Press, 2008), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other parallels can be found in works of Irish provenance or character, such as Pseudo-Cyprian's ''[[Duodecim abusivis saeculi|De XII Abusiuis Saeculi]]'', the Irish [[Pseudo-Bede]]'s ''De XIII Diuisionibus Temporum'', the [[Cambrai Homily]], and [[Pseudo-Isidore]]'s ''Questiones tam de nouo quam de uetere testamentum''.&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistically, the text is influenced by [[Merovingian]] and [[Vulgar Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Prebiarum'' is addressed to an Adalfeus (''Adalfeo spiritali''), who might tenuously be identified as the Adelphus (d. 670) who was the third [[abbot]] of [[Remiremont Abbey|Remiremont]]. The ''Adalfeo'' of the text might also be a mistaken [[Romanization of Greek|transliteration of Greek]] Ἀδελφῷ (from ''adelphos'', "brother"), and the phrase mean "for a spiritual brother."&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'' p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triads==
[[File:Saint Virgiliusm, Salzburg (detail).jpg|thumb|100px|The '''''Prebiarum''''' most likely originated within the circle of [[Vergilius of Salzburg|St. Virgilius]] in Salzburg]]

The ''Prebiarum'' provides an enumerative response to many of the questions it poses, often in the form of a triadic utterance, including triads on greed (''cupiditas'')&lt;ref&gt;Richard Newhauser, ''The Early History of Greed: The Sin Of Avarice in Early Medieval Thought and Literature'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 112 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OJiMn6CZ60EC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=Prebiarum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Prebiarum&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cambrai Homily#The colors of martyrdom|martyrdom]]. One pair of triads is of a type circulated in other florilegia of moral extracts:&lt;ref&gt;For example, the ''Liber exhortationis'' of [[Paulinus I of Aquileia|Paulinus of Aquileia]]; for further examples of the "Three Utterances," see Mary F. Wack and Charles D. Wright, "A New Latin Source for the Old English 'Three Utterances' Exemplum," in ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991), vol. 20, p. 197 [https://books.google.com/books?id=21xhHS5eBdsC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=%22Quod+sunt+quae+pessima+sunt+in+hoc+mundo%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kE8cYOOKBv&amp;sig=5U_SI94q8EH-y5TWUyqEU1UDqc0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZzD4StfTC5GKNNfBmekF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Quod%20sunt%20quae%20pessima%20sunt%20in%20hoc%20mundo%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What are the worst things in this world? There are three. The soul of a sinner after death, the demons coming into his path, and not getting well rid of them for eternity.

What are the best things in this world? There are three. The soul of a just man after its departure from the body, and angels coming into his path, and to possess the eternal kingdom without end.&lt;ref&gt;''Quod sunt quae pessima sunt in hoc mundo? Id, III. Anima peccatoris post mortem, et demones venientes in obviam ei, et bene non deficiens ab eis in perpetuum.''
&lt;br&gt;''Quod sunt meliora sunt in hoc mundo? Id, tres. Anima iusti post exitum de corpore, et angeli venientes in obviam ei, et regnum perpetuum possidere sine fine.'' ''Prebiarum'' 32–33 (McNally, ''SHM'' p. 164).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The text==
The ''Prebiarum'' exists in a single [[manuscript]] that was most likely transcribed in the [[scriptorium]] of Bishop [[Arbeo of Freising]]. It thus originated in southeast Germany around [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]], probably within the circle of [[Vergilius of Salzburg|St. Virgilius]], which had a strong Irish presence. It is bound with five other minor works, four of which are of Irish provenance. [[Orthography]] and linguistic aspects date the work to the mid-8th century.&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''HSM'' pp. 155, 158, 159. Claudia di Sciacca concurs that the ''Prebiarum'' likely originated in the Salzburg area at the time of the bishop Virgilius, despite its Irish character; p. 43; Charles Darwin Wright, ''The Irish Tradition in Old English Literature'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 60–61, note 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Given this setting, it may be Arbeo who is addressed in the dedication as a "spiritual brother."&lt;ref&gt;McNally, ''SHM'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Manufacturing}}
'''Supervisory control and data acquisition''' ('''SCADA''') is a [[control system]] architecture that uses computers, networked data communications and [[graphical user interface]]s for [[high-level]] process [[supervisory management]], but uses other peripheral devices such as [[programmable logic controller]] (PLC) and discrete [[PID controller]]s to interface with the process plant or machinery. The operator interfaces that enable monitoring and the issuing of process commands, such as controller set point changes, are handled through the SCADA computer system. However, the real-time control logic or controller calculations are performed by networked modules that connect to the field sensors and [[actuators]].

The SCADA concept was developed as a universal means of remote access to a variety of local control modules, which could be from different manufacturers allowing access through standard automation [[List of automation protocols|protocols]]. In practice, large SCADA systems have grown to become very similar to [[distributed control system]]s in function, but using multiple means of interfacing with the plant. They can control large-scale processes that can include multiple sites, and work over large distances as well as small distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfxr5DikdP0 |title=Back to Basics: SCADA |author=Boys, Walt |publisher=Automation TV: Control Global - Control Design |date=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most commonly-used types of [[industrial control system]]s, however there are concerns about SCADA systems being vulnerable to cyberwarfare/cyberterrorism attacks.&lt;ref name=NGF-CA-GT-01&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberthreats, Vulnerabilities and Attacks on SCADA  Networks |url=http://gspp.berkeley.edu/iths/Tsang_SCADA%20Attacks.pdf |work=Rosa Tang, berkeley.edu |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813015252/http://gspp.berkeley.edu/iths/Tsang_SCADA%20Attacks.pdf |archivedate=13 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The SCADA concept in control operations==
[[File:Functional levels of a Distributed Control System.svg|thumb|500px|Functional levels of a manufacturing control operation]]

The key attribute of a SCADA system is its ability to perform a supervisory operation over a variety of other proprietary devices.

The accompanying diagram is a general model which shows functional manufacturing levels using computerised control.

Referring to the diagram,

* Level 0 contains the field devices such as flow and temperature sensors, and final control elements, such as [[control valve]]s.
* Level 1 contains the industrialised input/output (I/O) modules, and their associated distributed electronic processors.   
* Level 2 contains the supervisory computers, which  collate information from processor nodes on the system, and provide the operator control screens. 
* Level 3 is the production control level, which does not directly control the process, but is concerned with monitoring production and targets.
* Level 4 is the production scheduling level.

Level 1 contains the [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs) or [[remote terminal unit]]s (RTUs).

Level 2 contains the SCADA software and computing platform. The SCADA software exists only at this supervisory level as control actions are performed automatically by RTUs or PLCs. SCADA control functions are usually restricted to basic overriding or supervisory level intervention. For example, a PLC may control the flow of cooling water through part of an industrial process to a set point level, but the SCADA system software will allow operators to change the set points for the flow. The SCADA also enables alarm conditions, such as loss of flow or high temperature, to be displayed and recorded. A [[feedback control]] loop is directly controlled by the RTU or PLC, but the SCADA software monitors the overall performance of the loop.

Levels 3 and 4 are not strictly process control in the traditional sense, but are where production control and scheduling takes place.

[[Data acquisition]] begins at the RTU or PLC level and includes [[instrumentation]] readings and equipment status reports that are communicated to level 2 SCADA as required. Data is then compiled and formatted in such a way that a control room operator using the HMI ([[Human Machine Interface]]) can make supervisory decisions to adjust or override normal RTU (PLC) controls. Data may also be fed to a [[Operational historian|historian]], often built on a commodity [[database management system]], to allow trending and other analytical auditing.

SCADA systems typically use  a ''tag database'', which contains data elements called ''tags'' or ''points'', which relate to specific instrumentation or actuators within the process system according to such as the [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]]. Data is accumulated against these unique process control equipment tag references.

==Examples of use==
[[File:Freer Water Control and Improvement District - Diana Adame.jpg|thumb|Example of SCADA used in office environment to remotely monitor a process]]

Both large and small systems can be built using the SCADA concept. These systems can range from just tens to thousands of [[control loop]]s, depending on the application. Example processes include industrial, infrastructure, and facility-based processes, as described below:

* [[Industrial process]]es include  [[manufacturing]], [[Process control]],  [[power generation]], [[Fabrication (metal)|fabrication]], and refining, and may run in continuous, batch, repetitive, or discrete modes.
* [[Infrastructure]] processes may be public or private, and include [[water treatment]] and distribution, wastewater collection and [[waste water treatment|treatment]], [[Fossil gas pipeline|oil and gas pipeline]]s, [[electric power transmission]] and [[Electric power distribution|distribution]], and [[wind farm]]s.
* Facility processes, including buildings, airports, [[Ship#Today|ship]]s, and [[space station]]s. They monitor and control [[heating, ventilation, and air conditioning]] systems (HVAC), [[Access control|access]], and [[Efficient energy use|energy consumption]].

However, SCADA systems may have security vulnerabilities, so the systems should be evaluated to identify risks and solutions implemented to mitigate those risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Boyer|first= Stuart A.|title= SCADA Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition|year=2010 |publisher= ISA - International Society of Automation |location= USA |isbn=978-1-936007-09-7 |page= 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SCADA system components==
[[Image:Scada std anim no lang.gif|thumb|Typical SCADA mimic shown as an animation. For process plant, these are based upon the [[piping and instrumentation diagram]].]]

A SCADA system usually consists of the following main elements:

===Supervisory computers===
This is the core of the SCADA system, gathering data on the process and sending control commands to the field connected devices. It refers to the computer and software responsible for communicating with the field connection controllers, which are RTUs and PLCs, and includes the HMI software running on operator workstations.  In smaller SCADA systems, the supervisory computer may be composed of a single PC, in which case the HMI is a part of this computer. In larger SCADA systems, the master station may include several HMIs hosted on client computers, multiple servers for data acquisition, distributed software applications, and disaster recovery sites. To increase the integrity of the system the multiple servers will often be configured in a [[Dual modular redundancy|dual-redundant]] or [[Hot spare|hot-standby]] formation providing continuous control and monitoring in the event of a server malfunction or breakdown.

===Remote terminal units===
{{Further information|Remote terminal unit}}
[[Remote terminal unit]]s, also known as (RTUs),  connect to sensors and actuators in the process, and are networked to the supervisory computer system.  RTUs are "intelligent I/O" and often have embedded control capabilities such as [[ladder logic]] in order to accomplish [[Boolean expression|boolean]] logic operations.&lt;ref name="Hieb2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeff Hieb|title=Security Hardened Remote Terminal Units for SCADA  Networks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-_PPgAACAAJ|year=2008|publisher=University of Louisville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programmable logic controllers===
{{Further information|Programmable logic controller}}
Also known as PLCs, these are connected to sensors and actuators in the process, and are networked to the supervisory system in the same way as RTUs. PLCs have more sophisticated embedded control capabilities than RTUs, and are programmed in one or more [[IEC 61131-3]] programming languages. PLCs are often used in place of RTUs as field devices because they are more economical, versatile, flexible and configurable.

===Communication infrastructure===
This connects the supervisory computer system to the RTUs and PLCs, and may use industry standard or manufacturer proprietary protocols.
Both RTU's and PLC's operate autonomously on the near-real time control of the process, using the last command given from the supervisory system. Failure of the communications network does not necessarily stop the plant process controls, and on resumption of communications, the operator can continue with monitoring and control. Some critical systems will have dual redundant data highways, often cabled via diverse routes.

===Human-machine interface===
{{Further information|Graphical user interface}}
[[File:Scada_Animation.ogv|thumb|right|More complex SCADA animation showing control of four batch cookers]]
The human-machine interface (HMI) is the operator window of the supervisory system. It presents plant information to the operating personnel graphically in the form of mimic diagrams, which are a schematic representation of the plant being controlled, and alarm and event logging pages. The HMI is linked to the SCADA supervisory computer to provide live data to drive the mimic diagrams, alarm displays and trending graphs. In many installations the HMI is the graphical user interface for the operator, collects all data from external devices, creates reports, performs alarming, sends notifications, etc.

Mimic diagrams consist of line graphics and schematic symbols to represent process elements, or may consist of digital photographs of the process equipment overlain with animated symbols.

Supervisory operation of the plant is by means of the HMI, with operators issuing commands using mouse pointers, keyboards and touch screens. For example, a symbol of a pump can show the operator that the pump is running, and a flow meter symbol can show how much fluid it is pumping through the pipe. The operator can switch the pump off from the mimic by a mouse click or screen touch. The HMI will show the flow rate of the fluid in the pipe decrease in real time.

The HMI package for a SCADA system typically includes a drawing program that the operators or system maintenance personnel use to change the way these points are represented in the interface. These representations can be as simple as an on-screen traffic light, which represents the state of an actual traffic light in the field, or as complex as a multi-projector display representing the position of all of the elevators in a skyscraper or all of the trains on a railway.

A '''"historian",''' is a software service within the HMI which accumulates time-stamped data, events, and alarms in a database which can be queried or used to populate graphic trends in the HMI.  The historian is a client that requests data from a data acquisition server.&lt;ref name="Raul2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aquino-Santos, Raul|title=Emerging Technologies in Wireless Ad-hoc Networks: Applications and Future Development: Applications and Future Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UN2eBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|date=30 November 2010|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-60960-029-7|pages=43–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alarm handling==
{{Further information|Alarm management}}
An important part of most SCADA implementations is [[alarm management|alarm handling]]. The system monitors whether certain alarm conditions are satisfied, to determine when an alarm event has occurred. Once an alarm event has been detected, one or more actions are taken (such as the activation of one or more alarm indicators, and perhaps the generation of email or text messages so that management or remote SCADA operators are informed). In many cases, a SCADA operator may have to acknowledge the alarm event; this may deactivate some alarm indicators, whereas other indicators remain active until the alarm conditions are cleared.

Alarm conditions can be explicit—for example, an alarm point is a digital status point that has either the value NORMAL or ALARM that is calculated by a formula based on the values in other analogue and digital points—or implicit: the SCADA system might automatically monitor whether the value in an analogue point lies outside high and low- limit values associated with that point.

Examples of alarm indicators include a siren, a pop-up box on a screen, or a coloured or flashing area on a screen (that might act in a similar way to the "fuel tank empty" light in a car); in each case, the role of the alarm indicator is to draw the operator's attention to the part of the system 'in alarm' so that appropriate action can be taken.

==PLC/RTU programming==
"Smart" RTUs, or standard PLCs, are capable of autonomously executing simple logic processes without involving the supervisory computer. They employ standardized control programming languages  such as under, [[IEC 61131-3]] (a suite of 5 programming languages including function block, ladder, structured text, sequence function charts and instruction list), is frequently used to create programs which run on these RTUs and PLCs.  Unlike a procedural language such as the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] or [[FORTRAN]], IEC 61131-3 has minimal training requirements by virtue of resembling historic physical control arrays. This allows SCADA system engineers to perform both the design and implementation of a program to be executed on an RTU or PLC.

A [[programmable automation controller]] (PAC) is a compact controller that combines the features and capabilities of a PC-based control system with that of a typical PLC. PACs are deployed in SCADA systems to provide RTU and PLC functions. In many electrical substation SCADA applications, "distributed RTUs" use information processors or station computers to communicate with [[digital protective relay]]s, PACs, and other devices for I/O, and communicate with the SCADA master in lieu of a traditional RTU.

==PLC commercial integration==
Since about 1998, virtually all major PLC manufacturers have offered integrated HMI/SCADA systems, many of them using open and non-proprietary communications protocols.  Numerous specialized third-party HMI/SCADA packages, offering built-in compatibility with most major PLCs, have also entered the market, allowing mechanical engineers, electrical engineers and technicians to configure HMIs themselves, without the need for a custom-made program written by a software programmer.
The Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) connects to physical equipment. Typically, an RTU converts the electrical signals from the equipment to digital values such as the open/closed status from a switch or a valve, or measurements such as pressure, flow, voltage or current. By converting and sending these electrical signals out to equipment the RTU can control equipment, such as opening or closing a switch or a valve, or setting the speed of a pump.

==Communication infrastructure and methods==
SCADA systems have traditionally used combinations of radio and direct wired connections, although  [[Synchronous optical networking|SONET/SDH]] is also frequently used for large systems such as railways and power stations. The remote management or monitoring function of a SCADA system is often referred to as [[telemetry]]. Some users want SCADA data to travel over their pre-established corporate networks or to share the network with other applications. The legacy of the early low-bandwidth protocols remains, though.

SCADA protocols are designed to be very compact. Many are designed to send information only when the master station polls the RTU. Typical legacy SCADA protocols include [[Modbus]] RTU, [[RP-570]], [[Profibus]] and Conitel. These communication protocols, with the exception of Modbus (Modbus has been made open by Schneider Electric), are all SCADA-vendor specific but are widely adopted and used. Standard protocols are [[IEC 60870-5|IEC 60870-5-101 or 104]], [[IEC 61850]] and [[DNP3]]. These communication protocols are standardized and recognized by all major SCADA vendors. Many of these protocols now contain extensions to operate over [[TCP/IP]]. Although the use of conventional networking specifications, such as [[TCP/IP]], blurs the line between traditional and industrial networking, they each fulfill fundamentally differing requirements.&lt;ref name=GallowayIntro&gt;{{cite journal|title=Introduction to Industrial Control Networks|journal=IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials|year=2012|url=http://www.rfidblog.org.uk/Preprint-GallowayHancke-IndustrialControlSurvey.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Network simulation]] can be used in conjunction with SCADA simulators to perform various 'what-if' analyses.

With increasing security demands (such as [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] (NERC) and [[critical infrastructure protection]] (CIP) in the US), there is increasing use of satellite-based communication. This has the key advantages that the infrastructure can be self-contained (not using circuits from the public telephone system), can have built-in encryption, and can be engineered to the availability and reliability required by the SCADA system operator.  Earlier experiences using consumer-grade [[Very-small-aperture terminal|VSAT]] were poor. Modern carrier-class systems provide the quality of service required for SCADA.&lt;ref name=berganELP&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bergan|first=Christian|title=Demystifying Satellite for the Smart Grid: Four Common Misconceptions|journal=Electric Light &amp; Powers|date=August 2011|volume=16|series=Utility Automation &amp; Engineering T&amp;D|issue=8|url=http://www.elp.com/index/display/article-display/5666163079/articles/utility-automation-engineering-td/volume-16/issue-8/features/demystifying-satellite-for-the-smart-grid-four-common-misconceptions.html|accessdate=2 May 2012|at=Four|publisher=PennWell|location=Tulsa, OK|quote=satellite is a cost-effective and secure solution that can provide backup communications and easily support core smart grid applications like SCADA, telemetry, AMI backhaul and distribution automation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTUs and other automatic controller devices were developed before the advent of industry wide standards for interoperability. The result is that developers and their management created a multitude of control protocols. Among the larger vendors, there was also the incentive to create their own protocol to "lock in" their customer base. A [[list of automation protocols]] is compiled here.

[[OLE for process control]] (OPC) can connect different hardware and software, allowing communication even between devices originally not intended to be part of an industrial network.

Standardisation in the field of mySCADA protocols resulted into the vendor independent protocol called OPC UA (Unified Architecture). OPC UA is starting to be widely adopted among multiple SCADA vendors. 

==SCADA architecture development==
[[File:SCADA C4ISR Facilities.pdf|thumb|The [[United States Army]]'s Training Manual 5-601 covers "SCADA Systems for [[C4ISTAR|C4ISR]] Facilities"]]
SCADA systems have evolved through four generations as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scadahacker.com/library/Documents/ICS_Basics/SCADA%20Basics%20-%20NCS%20TIB%2004-1.pdf |title=Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) Systems |publisher=NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM |author=OFFICE OF THE MANAGER NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMctober 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engineersgarage.com/articles/scada-systems |title=SCADA Systems april 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scadahistory.com/ |title=A Brief History of SCADA/EMS (2015) |author=J. Russel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811051350/http://scadahistory.com/ |archivedate=11 August 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First generation: "monolithic"===
Early SCADA system computing was done by large [[minicomputers]]. Common network services did not exist at the time SCADA was developed. Thus SCADA systems were independent systems with no connectivity to other systems. The communication protocols used were strictly proprietary at that time. The first-generation SCADA system redundancy was achieved using a back-up mainframe system connected to all the [[Remote Terminal Unit]] sites and was used in the event of failure of the primary mainframe system.&lt;ref name="Proquest-text"&gt;{{cite book|title=Security Hardened Remote Terminal Units for SCADA Networks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5O5N1vjbQgC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-54831-7|pages=12–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some first generation SCADA systems were developed as "turn key" operations that ran on minicomputers such as the [[PDP-11]] series made by the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}.

===Second generation: "distributed"===
SCADA information and command processing was distributed across multiple stations which were connected through a LAN. Information was shared in near real time. Each station was responsible for a particular task, which reduced the cost as compared to First Generation SCADA. The network protocols used were still not standardized. Since these protocols were proprietary, very few people beyond the developers knew enough to determine how secure a SCADA installation was. Security of the SCADA installation was usually overlooked.
===Third generation: "networked"===

Similar to a distributed architecture, any complex SCADA can be reduced to the simplest components and connected through communication protocols. In the case of a networked design, the system may be spread across more than one LAN network called a [[Process control network|process control network (PCN)]] and separated geographically. Several distributed architecture SCADAs running in parallel, with a single supervisor and historian, could be considered a network architecture. This allows for a more cost-effective solution in very large scale systems.

===Fourth generation: "Internet of things"===
With the commercial availability of [[cloud computing]], SCADA systems have increasingly adopted [[Internet of things]] technology to significantly improve interoperability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=SCADA as a service approach for interoperability of micro-grid platforms | doi=10.1016/j.segan.2016.08.001 | newspaper=Sustainable Energy, Grids and Network | date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduce infrastructure costs and increase ease of maintenance and integration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scada.com/verticals/internetofthings/ SCADA and the Internet of Things] Retrieved May 22, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, SCADA systems can now report state in near real-time and use the horizontal scale available in cloud environments to implement more complex control algorithms &lt;ref&gt;{{cite | title=SCADA as a service approach for interoperability of micro-grid platforms | doi=10.1016/j.segan.2016.08.001 | newspaper=Sustainable Energy, Grids and Network | date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; than are practically feasible to implement on traditional [[programmable logic controller]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcompany.com/biomimicry/how-the-internet-of-things-is-turning-cities-into-organisms/ How The "Internet Of Things" Is Turning Cities Into Living Organisms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021181958/http://www.fastcompany.com/biomimicry/how-the-internet-of-things-is-turning-cities-into-organisms |date=21 October 2013 }} Retrieved September 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the use of open network protocols such as [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] inherent in the Internet of things technology, provides a more readily comprehensible and manageable security boundary than the heterogeneous mix of proprietary network protocols typical of many decentralized SCADA implementations.

This decentralization of data also requires a different approach to SCADA than traditional PLC based programs. When a SCADA system is used locally, the preferred methodology involves binding the graphics on the user interface to the data stored in specific PLC memory addresses. However, when the data comes from a disparate mix of sensors, controllers and databases (which may be local or at varied connected locations), the typical 1 to 1 mapping becomes problematic. A solution to this is [[data modeling]], a concept derived from object oriented programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The History of Data Modeling | url=http://www.exforsys.com/tutorials/data-modeling/the-history-of-data-modeling.html | newspaper=Exforsys Inc. | date=11 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a data model, a virtual representation of each device is constructed in the SCADA software. These virtual representations (“models”) can contain not just the address mapping of the device represented, but also any other pertinent information (web based info, database entries, media files, etc.) that may be used by other facets of the SCADA/IoT implementation. As the increased complexity of the Internet of things renders traditional SCADA increasingly “house-bound,” and as communication protocols evolve to favor platform-independent, service-oriented architecture (such as [[OPC UA]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=CIM and OPC UA for interoperability of micro-grid platforms | url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01368458/ | newspaper=Proceedings of the IEEE ISGT 2016 Conference. | date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is likely that more SCADA software developers will implement some form of data modeling.

==Security issues==
SCADA systems that tie together decentralized facilities such as power, oil, gas pipelines, water distribution and wastewater collection systems were designed to be open, robust, and easily operated and repaired, but not necessarily secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Boyes|first= Walt|title=Instrumentation Reference Book, 4th Edition|year=2011 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location= USA|isbn=0-7506-8308-2|page= 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move from proprietary technologies to more standardized and open solutions together with the increased number of connections between SCADA systems, office networks and the [[Internet]] has made them more vulnerable to types of [[Attack (computing)#Types of attacks|network attacks]] that are relatively common in [[computer security]]. For example, [[ICS-CERT|United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)]] released a vulnerability advisory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICSA-11-231-01.pdf|title=ICSA-11-231-01—INDUCTIVE AUTOMATION IGNITION INFORMATION DISCLOSURE VULNERABILITY |accessdate=21 Jan 2013|date=19 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; warning that unauthenticated users could download sensitive configuration information including [[Cryptographic hash function#File or data identifier|password hashes]] from an [[Inductive Automation]] [[Ignition SCADA|Ignition]] system utilizing a standard [[Semantic URL attack|attack type]] leveraging access to the [[Apache Tomcat|Tomcat]] [[Embedded Web server]]. Security researcher Jerry Brown submitted a similar advisory regarding a [[buffer overflow]] vulnerability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/pdf/ICSA-11-094-01.pdf|title=ICSA-11-094-01—WONDERWARE INBATCH CLIENT ACTIVEX BUFFER OVERFLOW|accessdate=26 Mar 2013|date=13 Apr 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[Wonderware]] InBatchClient [[ActiveX control]]. Both vendors made updates available prior to public vulnerability release. Mitigation recommendations were standard [[Software patching|patching]] practices and requiring [[VPN]] access for secure connectivity. Consequently, the security of some SCADA-based systems has come into question as they are seen as potentially vulnerable to [[cyber attack]]s.&lt;ref name=NGF-CA-GT-01&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberthreats, Vulnerabilities and Attacks on SCADA  Networks |url=http://gspp.berkeley.edu/iths/Tsang_SCADA%20Attacks.pdf |work=Rosa Tang, berkeley.edu |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813015252/http://gspp.berkeley.edu/iths/Tsang_SCADA%20Attacks.pdf |archivedate=13 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-federal-06/BH-Fed-06-Maynor-Graham-up.pdf |title=SCADA Security and Terrorism: We're Not Crying Wolf |author=D.

Graham |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11402 |title=SCADA system makers pushed toward security |publisher=SecurityFocus |author=Robert Lemos |date=26 July 2006 |accessdate=9 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, security researchers are concerned about
* the lack of concern about security and authentication in the design, deployment and operation of some existing SCADA networks
* the belief that SCADA systems have the benefit of [[security through obscurity]] through the use of specialized protocols and proprietary interfaces
* the belief that SCADA networks are secure because they are physically secured
* the belief that SCADA networks are secure because they are disconnected from the Internet

SCADA systems are used to control and monitor physical processes, examples of which are transmission of electricity, transportation of gas and oil in pipelines, water distribution, traffic lights, and other systems used as the basis of modern society.  The security of these SCADA systems is important because compromise or destruction of these systems would impact multiple areas of society far removed from the original compromise.  For example, a blackout caused by a compromised electrical SCADA system would cause financial losses to all the customers that received electricity from that source.  &lt;!-- Removed FUD --&gt;How security will affect legacy SCADA and new deployments remains to be seen.

There are many threat vectors to a modern SCADA system. One is the threat of unauthorized access to the control software, whether it is human access or changes induced intentionally or accidentally by virus infections and other software threats residing on the control host machine. Another is the threat of packet access to the network segments hosting SCADA devices. In many cases, the control protocol lacks any form of [[Cryptography|cryptographic security]], allowing an attacker to control a SCADA device by sending commands over a network. In many cases SCADA users have assumed that having a VPN offered sufficient protection, unaware that security can be trivially bypassed with physical access to SCADA-related network jacks and switches. Industrial control vendors suggest approaching SCADA security like [[Information security|Information Security]] with a [[Defense in depth#Information security|defense in depth]] strategy that leverages common IT practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockwellautomation.com/resources/downloads/rockwellautomation/pdf/products-technologies/security-technology/securat001aene.pdf|title=Industrial Security Best Practices|publisher=Rockwell Automation |accessdate=26 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliable function of SCADA systems in our modern infrastructure may be crucial to public health and safety. As such, attacks on these systems may directly or indirectly threaten public health and safety. Such an attack has already occurred, carried out on Maroochy Shire Council's sewage control system in Queensland, Australia.&lt;ref name=SlayMiller&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slay|first1=J.|last2=Miller|first2=M.|title=Critical infrastructure protection|date=November 2007|publisher=Springer Boston|isbn=978-0-387-75461-1|pages=73–82|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m1100j53q348x053/|edition=Online-Ausg.|accessdate=2 May 2012|chapter=Chpt 6: Lessons Learned from the Maroochy Water Breach}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after a contractor installed a SCADA system in January 2000, system components began to function erratically. Pumps did not run when needed and alarms were not reported.  More critically, sewage flooded a nearby park and contaminated an open surface-water drainage ditch and flowed 500 meters to a tidal canal. The SCADA system was directing sewage valves to open when the design protocol should have kept them closed. Initially this was believed to be a system bug.  Monitoring of the system logs revealed the malfunctions were the result of cyber attacks. Investigators reported 46 separate instances of malicious outside interference before the culprit was identified.  The attacks were made by a disgruntled ex-employee of the company that had installed the SCADA system.  The ex-employee was hoping to be hired by the utility full-time to maintain the system.

In April 2008, the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack issued a Critical Infrastructures Report  which discussed the extreme vulnerability of SCADA systems to an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) event. After testing and analysis, the Commission concluded: "SCADA systems are vulnerable to an EMP event. The large numbers and widespread reliance on such systems by all of the Nation’s critical infrastructures represent a systemic threat to their continued operation following an EMP event. Additionally, the necessity to reboot, repair, or replace large numbers of geographically widely dispersed systems will considerably impede the Nation’s recovery from such an assault."&lt;ref name="Critical Infrastructures Report, Congressional EMP Commission, 2008"&gt;http://www.empcommission.org/docs/A2473-EMP_Commission-7MB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many vendors of SCADA and control products have begun to address the risks posed by unauthorized access by developing lines of specialized industrial [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] and [[VPN]] solutions for TCP/IP-based SCADA networks as well as external SCADA monitoring and recording equipment.&lt;!-- Removed Vendor Advertisement, replaced with neutral tone --&gt;&lt;!-- Removed Vendor Advertisement, replaced with neutral tone --&gt;&lt;!--Removed Marketing Magazine article, you can add it as a reference at the bottom to support a set of statements--&gt;
The [[International Society of Automation]] (ISA) started formalizing SCADA security requirements in 2007 with a working group, WG4. WG4 "deals specifically with unique technical requirements, measurements, and other features required to evaluate and assure security resilience and performance of industrial automation and control systems devices".&lt;ref name=InTechViaISA&gt;{{cite news|title=Security for all|url=http://www.isa.org|accessdate=2 May 2012|newspaper=InTech|authorlink=Security for all|date=June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased interest in SCADA vulnerabilities has resulted in vulnerability researchers discovering vulnerabilities in commercial SCADA software &lt;!-- removed vendor names --&gt; and more general offensive SCADA techniques presented to the general security community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c4-security.com/SCADA%20Security%20-%20Generic%20Electric%20Grid%20Malware%20Design%20-%20SyScan08.pps |title=SCADA Security – Generic Electric Grid Malware Design |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107085040/http://www.c4-security.com/SCADA%20Security%20-%20Generic%20Electric%20Grid%20Malware%20Design%20-%20SyScan08.pps |archivedate=7 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- citations as support of the statements are fine --&gt; In electric and gas utility SCADA systems, the vulnerability of the large installed base of wired and wireless serial communications links is addressed in some cases by applying [[bump-in-the-wire]] devices that employ authentication and [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] encryption rather than replacing all existing nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal   | author = KEMA, Inc.

In June 2010, anti-virus security company [[VirusBlokAda]] reported the first detection of malware that attacks SCADA systems (Siemens' [[WinCC]]/PCS 7 systems) running on Windows operating systems. The malware is called [[Stuxnet]] and uses four [[zero-day attack]]s to install a [[rootkit]] which in turn logs into the SCADA's database and steals design and control files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20011159-245.html|title=Details of the first-ever control system malware (FAQ)|last=Mills|first=Elinor|date=21 July 2010|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/llisapi.dll?func=cslib.csinfo&amp;lang=en&amp;objid=43876783&amp;caller=view|title=SIMATIC WinCC / SIMATIC PCS 7: Information concerning Malware / Virus / Trojan|date=21 July 2010|publisher=[[Siemens]]|quote=malware (trojan) which affects the visualization system WinCC SCADA.|accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The malware is also capable of changing the control system and hiding those changes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11671">'''Screen reading''' is the act of [[Reading (process)|reading]] a [[Written language|text]] on a [[computer screen]], [[smartphone]], [[e-book reader]], etc. It is often contrasted with the act of reading a text on [[paper]], in particular a [[Printing|print]]ed text.

== Discovery ==
[[Louis Émile Javal]], a French ophthalmologist and founder of an ophthalmology laboratory in Paris is credited with the introduction of the term [[saccades]] into eye movement research. Javal discovered that while reading, one’s eyes tend to jump across the text in saccades, and stop intermittently along each line in [[fixation (visual)|fixations]].&lt;ref name="Javal"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wade | first1 = Nicholas J | year = 2010 | title = Pioneers of Eye Movement Research | journal = i-Perception | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 33–68 | pmc=3563053 | pmid=23396982 | doi=10.1068/i0389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the lack of technology at the time, naked-eye observations were used to observe [[eye movement in reading|eye movement]], until later in the late 19th and mid-20th century [[eye tracking|eye-tracking]] experiments were conducted in an attempt to discover a pattern regarding eye fixations while reading.&lt;ref name="Javal"/&gt;

== Research ==

=== F-Pattern ===
In a 1997 study conducted by Jakob Nielsen, a leading web usability expert who co-founded usability consulting company [[Nielsen Norman Group]] with [[Donald Norman]], it was discovered that generally people read 25% slower on a computer screen in comparison with a printed page.&lt;ref name=Beam&gt;{{cite news |title=I screen, you screen, we all screen |author=[[Alex Beam]] |date=2009-06-19 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2009/06/19/paper_vs_computer_screen/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers state that this is only true for when reading on an older type computer screen with a low-scanrate.

In an additional study done in 2006, Nielsen also discovered that people read Web pages in an '''F-shaped pattern''' that consists of two horizontal stripes followed by a vertical stripe.&lt;ref name="F-Shape"&gt;{{cite web |title=F-Shaped Pattern For Reading Web Content |author=[[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]] |date=2006-04-17 |url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/reading_pattern.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had 232 participants fitted with eye-tracking cameras to trace their eye movements as they read online texts and webpages. The findings showed that people do not read the text on webpages word-by-word, but instead generally read horizontally across the top of the webpage, then in a second horizontal movement slightly lower on the page, and lastly  scan vertically down the left side of the screen.&lt;ref name="F-Shape"/&gt;

The Software Usability Research Laboratory at Wichita State University did a subsequent study in 2007 testing eye gaze patterns while searching versus browsing a website [http://usabilitynews.org/eye-gaze-patterns-while-searching-vs-browsing-a-website/], and the results confirmed that users appeared to follow Nielsen’s ‘F’ pattern while browsing and searching through text-based pages.&lt;ref&gt;Shrestha, Sav, and Kelsi Lenz. [http://usabilitynews.org/eye-gaze-patterns-while-searching-vs-browsing-a-website/ "Eye Gaze Patterns while Searching vs. Browsing a Website"], ''SURL'', Jan. 14, 2007, retrieved Feb. 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of German researchers conducted a study that examined the Web browsing behavior of 25 participants over the course of around one hundred days.The researchers concluded that "browsing is a rapidly interactive activity,"[https://ccit.college.columbia.edu/sites/ccit/files/weinreich-web-use-study.pdf] and that Web pages are mostly viewed for 10 seconds or less.&lt;ref&gt;H. Weinreich et al. [https://ccit.college.columbia.edu/sites/ccit/files/weinreich-web-use-study.pdf "Not Quite the Average: An Empirical Study of Web Use"], ''ACM Transactions on the Web'', Vol. 2, No. 1, Article 5, Feb. 2008, retrieved Feb. 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen analyzed this data in 2008 and found that, on average, users read 20-28% of the content on a webpage.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Jakob. [https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/ "How Little Do Users Read?"], ''Nielsen Norman Group'', May 6, 2008, retrieved Feb. 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Google Golden Triangle ===
A similar study, using search results from the [[Google search engine]], determined that readers primarily looked at a triangular area of the top and left side of the screen.  This corresponds to the Nielsen F-shaped pattern, and was dubbed the '''[[Golden Triangle (Internet Marketing)|Google Golden Triangle]]'''.&lt;ref name="EyetoolsGGTArch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eyetools.com/research_google_eyetracking_heatmap.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113060242/http://eyetools.com/research_google_eyetracking_heatmap.html |title=Google Search's Golden Triangle |publisher=Eyetools |archivedate=13 January 2013 |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent 2014 Meditative study &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediative.com/eye-tracking-google-through-the-years/ "Keeping an eye on Google – Eye tracking SERPs through the years"]&lt;/ref&gt; showed evidence of the declination of the Golden Triangle phenomenon since 2005 as users view more search result listings than before.

== Comparisons to Reading Printed Text ==
Since the first notion of screen reading, many studies have been performed to discern any differences between reading off of an electronic device and reading off of a paper.  In a 2013 study, a group of 72 high school students in Norway were randomly assigned into one of two groups: one that read using [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] files on a computer and one that used standard paper.  The students were put through various tests involving reading-comprehension and vocabulary. The results indicated that those who read using the PDF files performed much worse than those reading off of a paper. A conclusion was reached that certain aspects of screen reading, such as scrolling, can impede comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mangen|first=Anne|last2=Walgermo|first2=Bente R.|last3=Brønnick|first3=Kolbjørn|date=2013-01-01|title=Reading linear texts on paper versus computer screen: Effects on reading comprehension|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035512001127|journal=International Journal of Educational Research|volume=58|pages=61–68|doi=10.1016/j.ijer.2012.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all experiments have concluded that reading from a digitized screen can be detrimental.  The same year, another experiment was conducted on 90 undergraduates at a college in Western New York involving paper reading, computer reading, and e-book reading. Like the children in the Norwegian experiment, the students were tested for comprehension upon reading a number of passages: five focused around facts and information and the other five based on narratives.  No significant difference was found between any of the different forms of reading for either type of passage.  However, the researchers noted that due to the participants being college students who were accustomed to using technology, they may react differently to reading on electronic devices than older individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Margolin|first=Sara J.|last2=Driscoll|first2=Casey|last3=Toland|first3=Michael J.|last4=Kegler|first4=Jennifer Little|date=2013-07-01|title=E-readers, Computer Screens, or Paper: Does Reading Comprehension Change Across Media Platforms?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.2930/abstract|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|language=en|volume=27|issue=4|pages=512–519|doi=10.1002/acp.2930|issn=1099-0720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in 2014 by Tirza Lauterman and Rakefet Ackerman allowed subjects the option to choose between reading digitally or reading printed pages.  The results found that those who chose to read digitally performed worse than those who used print.  However, by practicing with PDF files, subjects that preferred to read on computers were able to overcome what researchers labeled as “screen inferiority” and managed to score just as well as paper readers, who did not improve with practice.  Lauterman and Ackerman concluded that the study supported the idea that screen reading is shallower than paper reading, but that with practice the shallowness can be removed as an impediment.  No conclusion has yet been reached among professionals regarding whether or not reading on a screen is significantly different than reading printed text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauterman|first=Tirza|last2=Ackerman|first2=Rakefet|date=2014-06-01|title=Overcoming screen inferiority in learning and calibration|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214001149|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=35|pages=455–463|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.02.046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Critics have voiced concerns about screen reading, though some have taken a more positive stance. [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] believes that we are transitioning from "book fluency to screen fluency, from literacy to visuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Becoming Screen Literate |author=[[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] |date=2008-11-21 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/magazine/23wwln-future-t.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Rosen.

'''Sexual jealousy''' is a special form of [[jealousy]] in [[human sexuality|sexual]] relationships, present in [[animal]]s that reproduce through [[internal fertilization]], and is based on suspected or imminent [[sexual infidelity]]. It is founded on the [[instinct]] of keeping [[gene]]s in the [[gene pool]] and expecting sexual partners to care for the [[offspring]]. The concept is studied in human and non-human [[primates]] in the field of [[evolutionary psychology]].

''Evolutionary psychologists'' have suggested that there is a gender difference in sexual jealousy driven by men and women's different reproductive biology.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The state of affairs: Explorations in infidelity and commitment|last=Duncombe, J., Harrison K., Allan., G, &amp; Marsden., D|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For men it is felt as a threat to his relationship's future because he could be cuckolded into raising children that are not his own. For women they can lose their relationship and all the benefits that entails to another. Research has shown that men are impacted more by sexual infidelity, while women are more impacted by emotional infidelity.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buss|first1=David|title=Strategies of Human Mating|journal=Psychological Topics|volume=15|issue=2|pages=239–260|year=2006|url=http://labs.la.utexas.edu/buss/files/2015/09/strategies_of_human_mating2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative explanation is from a ''social-cognitive perspective''. Typically men will place a lot of importance on their masculinity and sexual dominance. When the male's partner commits infidelity, these two components of his ego become severely threatened which is why men are more upset when a partner has sex with someone else. In contrast, women invest a lot of emotion into a relationship and will experience a threat to their self-perception when a partner commits infidelity, hence why women are more concerned with emotional infidelity rather than the sexual kind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some research has suggested that there are no sex differences in sexual jealousy, concluding that males and females both equally experience distress over emotional and sexual infidelity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sexual jealousy is cross-culturally universal but how it manifests itself may differ across cultures.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Hupka|first2=R|date=1987|title=Cross-cultural differences in the elicitation of sexual jealousy.|jstor=3812538|volume=23|issue=1|pages=12–22|ref=Buunk, Bram; Hupka, Ralph B.

Psychologists have found that males react very strongly to sexual infidelity, whereas females are more likely to forgive a one-time sexual adventure if it does not threaten the male [[parental investment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The moral animal: Why we are, the way we are: The new science of evolutionary psychology.|last = Wright, R.|publisher = Vintage|year = 2010|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, jealousy is likely to be evoked in females if they feel that their partner may leave them for another woman; this has been shown to be more likely to occur if the male commits emotional infidelity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Emotional infidelity occurs when one partner develops a meaningful, emotional attachment with someone outside of their primary romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Psychology of Jealousy and Envy|last = Salovey, P.|publisher = The Guildford Press|year = 1991|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotional jealousy ===
Many studies have shown that females tend to place a stronger emphasis on the emotional aspect of infidelity, over the sexual aspect; it is this emotional infidelity that becomes the focus of female sexual jealousy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The most direct evidence for female's focus on emotional jealousy comes from Buss et al. (1992)&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; who presented participants with scenarios in which they were asked to choose between a partner's sexual unfaithfulness and a partner's emotional unfaithfulness as the most distressing event. They found that more females than males reported a partner's emotional infidelity as the most distressing event. As well as using self-report measures, the researchers measured the participants' physiological responses ([[heart rate]] and [[electrodermal activity]]) to the scenarios; women were also found to be more physiologically upset to the idea of their partners committing emotional infidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Expression in females ===

==== Aggression ====
While most empirical research suggests that males are more likely to act aggressively in response to sexual jealousy, some studies have shown that females may also display aggression and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A mind of her own: The evolutionary psychology of women|last=Campbell, A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have been found to report that their hypothetical sexual jealousy would manifest itself as anger and physical aggression towards the man. It has been suggested that this is because women are more empathetic towards the "victim", triggering strong aggression towards the unfaithful man.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal
| last = Cross, C. P., &amp; Campbell, A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not known if these hypothetical reports would become actions in real life situations. Furthermore, statistics on [[domestic violence]] continue to show that in relationships it is primarily men who are the abusers, rather than the women.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

On the other hand, it has been suggested that because it is the woman that ultimately chooses the mate, aggression caused by infidelity is directed at the rival female. As a result, when a woman is around a suspected rival female, she is more likely than a male counterpart to announce that her companion is "taken", and go out of her way to enhance her appearance to her spouse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Self-blame ====
Following infidelity, women are more likely to focus their sexual jealousy on their own relationship and self-blame. Women are also more likely to experience symptoms of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] following the infidelity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Evidence for the interpretation that in jealousy situations women focus more on their own functioning as a partner comes from research by Dijkstra and Buunk (2002).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This research suggests that unlike men's jealousy, women's jealousy stems more from comparing their own qualities with those of the rival. That is, the higher the level of [[Social comparison theory|social comparison]], a personality characteristic referring to the tendency to compare one's characteristics with those of others, the more jealousy various rival characteristics evoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1991-98375-000|title=Intimate relationships|last=Brehm, S.

==== Mate guarding behaviour ====
''See main page:'' [[Mate guarding in humans]]

One behaviour arising from male's sexual jealousy towards their partner's sexual infidelity is mate guarding. These tactics are used to prevent partner infidelity and so might be used when there are perceived threats in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goetz|first=Aaron T.|last2=Shackelford|first2=Todd K.|last3=Weekes-Shackelford|first3=Viviana A.|last4=Euler|first4=Harald A.|last5=Hoier|first5=Sabine|last6=Schmitt|first6=David P.|last7=LaMunyon|first7=Craig W.|date=2005-03-01|title=Mate retention, semen displacement, and human sperm competition: a preliminary investigation of tactics to prevent and correct female infidelity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886904001722|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=38|issue=4|pages=749–763|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2004.05.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; It results in several behaviours, researchers have documented up to 19 different tactics used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=David|date=1988|title=From vigilance to violence: Tactics of mate retention in American undergraduates|url=|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|volume=9|issue=5|pages=291–317|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(88)90010-6|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes (but is not exclusive to):

* Enhancing their appearance.

=== Attachment style ===
According to [[attachment theory]], the quality of a child's interactions with caregivers during times of need shape their future interactions; this includes later relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://people.virginia.edu/~psykliff/pubs/publications/at2.pdf|title=Handbook of attachment: Theory, research, and clinical applications|last=Cassidy, J.|publisher=The Guildford Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that insecure-avoidant individuals tend to report more sexual jealousy than those who are securely attached. This may be due to the fact that, in comparison to securely attached individuals, those who are insecurely attached tend to experience lower levels of trust, intimacy and stability in their romantic relationships.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Explanations ==
Researchers have proposed a number of theories to explain sexual jealousy in both males and females. In addition, some of these explanations can be used to explain the sex differences in sexual jealousy and why there may be differences in the degree to which people experience jealousy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Evolutionary psychology perspective ===

Evolutionary psychologists propose that the core function of sexual jealousy is to retain access to a valuable mate.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal

For males, their biggest concern when they commit to a relationship is ensuring that any offspring produced is biologically theirs, therefore, sexual infidelity is a huge threat to them as there is then a chance that they are not the [[Genetics|genetic]] parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a male raises a child that is not genetically his own, he has effectively wasted his resources raising another man's child, that will not pass on any of his genes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

As women have genetic certainty when they bear a child this is not a concern to them, however, women do face a different evolutionary problem. If her partner becomes emotionally attached to another woman, there is a real chance that the male may share his resources with the other woman, or leave their current relationship all together. Either way, the female loses some of the male parental investment; the loss of her mate’s resources may significantly reduce the survival of herself and her offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The evolutionary psychology perspective has been supported by a study conducted by David Buss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=David M.|date=2013|title=Sexual jealousy|url=|journal=Psychological Topics|volume=22|pages=155–182|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that male sexual jealousy is triggered by sexual infidelity, whereas female sexual jealousy was triggered by emotional infidelity. The study concluded that sexual jealousy may be an adaptive function in which is triggered in order to retain access to a valuable mate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Researchers David Buss and Todd Shackleford propose and test several hypotheses about sexual jealousy:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=David M.|last2=Shackleford|first2=Todd K.|date=1997|title=From vigilance to violence: Mate retention tactics in married couples|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=72|issue=2|pages=346–361|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.2.346|pmid=|citeseerx=10.1.1.387.7053}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Men will devote more resources to mate retention when their partner is younger than them, than men whose partner is older than them'''. This hypothesis rests on the evolutionary principle of [[Mate Value|mate value]]. Younger women are likely to have more mate value because they are more [[Fertility|fertile]]. Therefore, it is predicted that men are likely to engage in mate retention behaviours more often when their partner is younger rather than older than them.
# Resting on the principle of mate value again, is the prediction that '''men will devote more resources to mate retention when their partner is perceived to be [[physically attractive]], than when their partner is perceived to be less physically attractive'''. Females who are physically attractive have a higher mate value than those who are less physically attractive.
# '''Women will allocate more resources to mate retention when their partner has a wealth of resources than women whose partners have few resources'''. This hypothesis also rests on the mate value principle. Men who have more resources and wealth have a higher mate value than those who do not.
# '''If a man perceives his partner as having a higher mate value than him, then he is more likely to engage in efforts towards mate retention than men who perceive their partners as having a lower than or equal to mate value than them.''' This hypothesis rests on perceived mate value. If a male's partner has a higher mate value than him, she is more likely to be able to attract other men who may be of a similar mate value to her. As such, the male is at a greater risk of losing her to another man with a higher mate value.
# '''Individuals who suspect their partners are being unfaithful are more likely to devote effort towards mate retention than those who do not suspect their partners are being unfaithful.''' This hypothesis relies on the perceived probability of infidelity. Men risk being cuckolded into raising children that are not genetically his, and women risk losing their mate's resources and time.
Their research provided evidence to support all above hypotheses except for hypothesis 5; this effect was unique to men only.

=== The double-shot hypothesis ===
The hypothesis contradicts the evolutionary perspective.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=D.M.|last2=Larsen|first2=R.J.|last3=Westen|first3=D|date=1996|title=Special Section Commentary: Sex Differences in Jealousy: Not Gone, Not Forgotten, and Not Explained by Alternative Hypotheses.|journal=Psychological Science|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00392.x|pmid=|jstor=40062983|volume=7|issue=6|pages=373–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes that these sex differences in feelings of sexual jealousy are due to beliefs and have not evolved.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

The double-shot hypothesis (also known as the two-for-one hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitty|first=M.T|last2=Quigley|first2=L.L.|date=2008|title=Emotional and sexual infidelity offline and in cyberspace.|journal=Journal of Marital and Family Therapy|doi=10.1111/j.1752-0606.2008.00088.x|pmid=19017185|volume=34|issue=4|pages=461–468|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/83753/7/WRAP_Emotional%20and%20Sexual%20infidelity_Whitty.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;) suggests that women have a belief that men can have sexual relations without emotionally committing themselves. Women also believe that for men, to have emotional commitment, sex is a prerequisite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desteno|first=D.A|last2=Salovey|first2=P|date=1996|title=Evolutionary origins of sex differences in jealousy?

|pmid=|access-date=25 March 2016|volume=20|issue=2|pages=121–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social-cognitive perspective ===
As both forms of jealousy are threatening to both men and women, the social-cognitive perspective suggests that there are no inherent, evolutionarily induced gender differences. Instead, both emotional and sexual jealousy are believed to occur when an individual believes that a rival is posing a threat to what one perceives to be a valuable interpersonal relationship. When the relationship or one's self-esteem is threatened, jealousy is evoked.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The perspective also provides explanations as to why men would be more upset by sexual infidelity than women. Men are socialized to be masculine, which includes having great sexual prowess. If a man’s partner commits sexual infidelity, this brings into question his sexual prowess and therefore threatens his masculinity. This results a strong, negative reaction in response to the sexual infidelity, which does not tend to occur in response to emotional infidelity. In contrast, women are taught to be emotional nurturers in a relationship, therefore, if their partner commits emotional infidelity, this may threaten her sense of self more than if her partner commits sexual infidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The social-cognitive perspective also proposes the '''''transactional model of jealousy''''', which can be used to explain why there may be differences in the degree to which individuals experience sexual jealousy within genders, as well as between genders. This model examines how three variables – (1) [[Physiological arousal|arousability]], (2) [[Personal commitment|commitment]] and, (3) insecurity – moderate jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

# Individual differences in sexual jealousy are determined by the difference in levels of ''physiological arousal'': individuals who are easily aroused have more intense jealous reactions, than those with lower physiological arousal
# ''Commitment'' refers to the degree of dedication a person has in the relationship: the more committed a person is to a relationship, the greater the threat of loss, which leads to greater feelings of jealousy
# ''Insecurity'' refers to the perceived level of commitment of the partner: if we perceive our partner to be uninvolved or disinterested in the relationship, we feel more insecure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The degree to which these factors are experienced together determine the intensity of sexual jealousy felt by an individual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Culture  ==
Sexual jealousy is cross-culturally universal and affects both men and women.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; However, the extent of sexual jealousy varies across cultures. Sexual jealousy is strongly mediated by culture in both heterosexual and homosexual couples&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawkins|first=R.O.|date=1990|title=The Relationship Between Culture, Personality, and Sexual Jealousy in Men in Heterosexual and Homosexual Relationships|url=http://search.proquest.com/psycinfo/docview/617891480/113308AE58FC4D14PQ/2?accountid=14888|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|doi=10.1300/j082v19n03_04|pmid=2212631|access-date=2 March 2016|volume=19|issue=3|pages=67–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  in males, is said to be prevalent in cultures in which heritability runs through the male side.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=W|last2=Eagly|first2=A.H.|date=2002|title=A cross-cultural analysis of the behavior of women and men: implications for the origins of sex differences.|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.5.699|pmid=12206191|volume=128|issue=5|pages=699–727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evocation ===

There are cross-cultural differences in behaviours that evoke sexual jealousy.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; Specifically, one study focused on seven different countries: Hungary, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Yugoslavia. Different behaviours were found to elicit different extents of sexual jealousy. For instance, flirting, kissing and sexual involvement elicit sexual jealousy across all of the nations. However, dancing, hugging and kissing evoke very different reactions across cultures. In the Soviet Union, the most sexual jealousy is seen across dancing, hugging, flirting and kissing behaviours. Yugoslavian participants display the most intense sexual jealousy to flirting behaviour but the least to kissing. Dutch participants show the least sexual jealousy to kissing, dancing and hugging behaviours.

=== In Western cultures ===
Societies that permit extra-marital sexual relations, often discourage sexual jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Canela: Bonding through kinship, ritual, and sex.|last=Crocker|first=W|last2=Crocker|first2=J|publisher=Harcourt Brace College|year=1994|isbn=|location=Fort Worth, TX|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Denmark very low sexual jealousy rates are determined by the very low 10% disapproval of extra-marital sex. On the other hand, individuals in the American Midwest show high feelings of sexual jealousy which corresponds to the 90% disapproval of extra-marital sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christensen|first=H.T.|date=1973|title=Attitudes toward marital infidelity: A nine-cultural sampling of university student opinion.|url=|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|jstor=41600842|volume=4|pages=197–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American men also feel more sexual jealousy compared to German men&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buunk|first=B.P.|last2=Angleitner|first2=A|last3=Oubaid|first3=V|last4=Buss|first4=D.M.|date=1996|title= Sex differences in jealousy in evolutionary and cultural perspective: Tests from the Netherlands, Germany, and the United States.|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/7/6/359.short|journal=Psychological Science|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00389.x|pmid=|access-date=2 March 2016|volume=7|issue=6|pages=359–363}}&lt;/ref&gt; when asked which would cause them more distress: i) a partner having formed a strong emotional attachment with another person or ii) a partner having passionate sexual intercourse with another person. Scenario i) measured sexual jealousy and scenario ii) measured emotional jealousy. The American men reported 33% greater sexual and emotional jealousy compared to German men.

Greater sexual jealousy seen in American men may be because in American culture, love, sex, family relationships and marriage are strongly connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Sexual Tragedy|last=Ellis|first=A|publisher=Lyle Stuart|year=1962|isbn=|location=Oxford, England|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, when partners therefore entangle with others, loss of love and relationship, and therefore sexual jealousy, is likely to be felt.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiederman|first=M.W|last2=Allgeier|first2=E.R|date=1993|title=Gender differences in sexual jealousy: Adaptionist or social learning explanation?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309593900116|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(93)90011-6|pmid=|access-date=19 March 2016|volume=14|issue=2|pages=115–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, in Western culture, inducement of sexual jealousy is more likely by females in their partners compared to men. Inducing sexual jealousy is to increase their partner's attention towards them and counteract sexual and emotional jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=G.L.|date=1980|title=Inducing Jealousy A Power Perspective|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/6/2/222.short|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|doi=10.1177/014616728062006|pmid=|access-date=19 March 2016|volume=6|issue=2|pages=222–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Western culture now is mainly monogamous which is very different to the environment in which the majority of evolution thus far has occurred.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Therefore, evolutionarily it is likely that different past cultures also showed differences in sexual jealousy.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== In Eastern cultures ===
Cross-cultural comparisons between China and United States reveal that, regardless of nation, men show greater sexual jealousy than women. Females show significantly higher levels of emotional jealousy. In contrast, between the nations, both men and women from the United States show greater sexual jealousy than Chinese individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geary|first=David C|last2=Rumsey|first2=Michael|last3=Bow-Thomas|first3=Christine|last4=Hoard|first4=Mary K|date=1995|title=Sexual jealousy as a facultative trait: Evidence from the pattern of sex differences in adults from China and the United States.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309595000577|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(95)00057-7|pmid=|access-date=2 March 2016|volume=16|issue=5|pages=355–383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In history, between 1880 and 1925, there were a large number of suicides amongst Indian immigrants on plantations in Fiji that reports attributed to sexual jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sites of desire/economies of pleasure: Sexualities in Asia and the Pacific.|last=Manderson|first=L|last2=Jolly|first2=M|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual Jealousy was high amongst these immigrants due to the disproportionate number of sexes: high numbers of men to few women. In suicide reports, sexual jealousy was described as a "racial trait" in Indian men and that it was evoked when European men slept with their women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lal|first=B.V|date=1985|title=Veil of Dishonour: Sexual jealousy and suicide on Fiji plantations|journal=The Journal of Pacific History|doi=10.1080/00223348508572516|pmid=11617439|jstor=25168874|volume=20|issue=3|pages=135–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations for cross-cultural differences ==

=== Evolutionary psychology model ===
The differences feelings of the jealousy across cultures provides support for the evolutionary psychological model. Different weightings are given to triggers of sexual jealousy cross-culturally. In liberal cultures, male mating effort is based on the number of women. These men therefore invest less time in each woman and, therefore, exhibit less sexual jealousy.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Paternity certainty ===
Paternity certainty is the extent to which a male knows or believes that a woman's child is his.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=P.J.|date=1978|title=Promiscuity, paternity, and culture.|journal=American Ethnologist|doi=10.1525/ae.1978.5.1.02a00110|pmid=|volume=5|pages=151–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In polygamous societies, men feel greater sexual jealousy when there is low paternity certainty.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This is because they don't want to risk losing time, energy and resources to a child that is not theirs.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Socio-economic differences between cultures also affects paternity certainty.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; In "natural fertility" countries, such as Namibia, 96% of males show sexual jealousy.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scelza|first=B.A.|date=2014|title=Jealousy in a small-scale, natural fertility population: the roles of paternity, investment and love in jealous response.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513813001219|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2013.11.003|pmid=|access-date=2 March 2016|volume=35|issue=2|pages=103–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there is greater likelihood of paternity loss and uncertainty due to lack of contraceptives.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This provides another explanation for why industrialised countries tend to show lower sexual jealousy compared to pre-industrialised.

[[File:PIA07712_-_F_ring_animation.gif|thumb|Prometheus (right) and Pandora both orbit near Saturn's F ring, but only Prometheus is thought to act as a shepherd.]]
[[File:Hirtenmond.png|thumb|'''Operation of a shepherd moon'''– particles are located in front or behind the Moon in its orbit, so these are either accelerated in the direction of the moon and thrown to the outside, or they are slowed down on their path and pulled inwards.]]
A '''shepherd moon''' (also herder moon, watcher moon) is a small [[natural satellite]] that clears a gap in [[planetary ring|planetary-ring]] material or keeps particles within a ring contained. The name is a result of the fact they limit the "herd" of the ring particles as a shepherd.

Due to their [[gravity|gravitational]] effect, they pick up particles and deflect them from their original orbits through [[orbital resonance]]. This causes gaps in the ring system, such as the particularly striking [[Cassini Division]], as well as other characteristic bands, or strange "twisted" deformation of rings.

==Examples==

=== Jupiter ===
Several of [[Jupiter]]'s small innermost moons, namely [[Metis (moon)|Metis]] and [[Adrastea (moon)|Adrastea]], are within Jupiter's [[Rings of Jupiter|ring system]] and are also within Jupiter's [[Roche limit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Planetary Science: The Geological Perspective|last=Faure|first=Gunter|last2=Mensing|first2=Teresa|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4020-5233-0|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that these rings are composed of material that is being pulled off these two bodies by Jupiter's [[tidal force]]s, possibly facilitated by impacts of ring material on their surfaces.

=== Saturn ===
The complex [[Rings of Saturn|ring system of]] [[Saturn]] has several such satellites. These include [[Prometheus (moon)|Prometheus]] (F ring),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2014/07010001-ringmoons-shepherds.html|title=On the masses and motions of mini-moons: Pandora's not a|website=www.planetary.org|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daphnis (moon)|Daphnis]] (Keeler Gap),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-051005.html|title=NASA - Cassini Finds New Saturn Moon That Makes Waves|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pan (moon)|Pan]] (Encke Gap),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Showalter|first=Mark R.|date=1991-06-27|title=Visual detection of 1981S13, Saturn's eighteenth satellite, and its role in the Encke gap|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v351/n6329/abs/351709a0.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=351|issue=6329|pages=709–713|doi=10.1038/351709a0|bibcode = 1991Natur.351..709S }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janus (moon)|Janus]], and [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]] (both A ring).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moutamid|first=Maryame El|last2=Nicholson|first2=Philip D.|last3=French|first3=Richard G.|last4=Tiscareno|first4=Matthew S.|last5=Murray|first5=Carl D.|last6=Evans|first6=Michael W.|last7=French|first7=Colleen McGhee|last8=Hedman|first8=Matthew M.|last9=Burns|first9=Joseph A.|date=2015-10-01|title=How Janus' Orbital Swap Affects the Edge of Saturn's A Ring?|arxiv=1510.00434|bibcode = 2016Icar..279..125E |doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2015.10.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slickline''' refers to a single strand wire which is used to run tools into wellbore for several purposes. It is used in the oil and gas industry, but also describes that niche of the industry that involves using a slickline truck or doing a slickline job.

Slickline looks like a long, smooth, unbraided wire, often shiny, silver/chrome in appearance. It comes in varying lengths, according to the depth of wells in the area it is used (it can be ordered to specification) up to 35,000 feet in length. It is used to lower and raise downhole tools used in oil and gas well maintenance to the appropriate depth of the drilled well. In use and appearance it is connected by the drum it is spooled off of in the back of the slickline truck to the wireline [[sheave]] a round wheel grooved and sized to accept a specified line and positioned to redirect the line to another sheave that will allow  the slickline to enter the wellbore.&lt;ref&gt;http://wirelinehq.com/wireline-basics/wireline-sheave-wheels/&lt;/ref&gt; Slickline is used to lower downhole tools into an oil or gas well to perform a specified maintenance job downhole. Downhole refers to the area in the pipe below surface, the pipe being either the casing cemented in the hole by the drilling rig (which keeps the drilled hole from caving in and pressure from the various oil or gas zones downhole from feeding into one another) or the tubing, a smaller diameter pipe hung inside the casing.

==Uses==
Slickline is more commonly used in production tubing. The wireline operator monitors at surface the slickline tension via a weight indicator gauge and the depth via a depth counter 'zeroed' from surface, lowers the downhole tool to the proper depth, completes the job by manipulating the downhole tool mechanically, checks to make sure it worked if possible, and pulls the tool back out by winding the slickline back onto the drum it was spooled from. The slickline drum is controlled by a hydraulic pump, which in turn is controlled by the 'slickline operator'.

Slickline comes in different sizes and grades. The larger the size, and higher the grade, generally means the higher line tension can be pulled before the line snaps at the weakest spot and causes a costly 'fishing' job. Due to downhole tools getting stuck because of malfunctions or 'downhole conditions' including sand, scale, salt, asphaltenes, and other well byproducts settling or loosening off the pipe walls because of agitation either by the downhole tools or a change in downhole inflow, sometimes it is necessary to pull hard on the tools to bring them back uphole to surface. If the tools are stuck, and the operator pulls too hard, the line will snap or pull apart at the weakest spot, which is generally closer to surface as the further uphole the weak point in the line is, the more weight it has to support (the weight of the line).

Weak spots in the line can be caused by making the circle around the counter wheel, making a bend around a sheave, a kink in a line from normal use (when rigging up the equipment extra line must be pulled out from the truck to give enough slack when the pressure control lubricator is picked up - this leaves line coiled on the often rutted ground, and sometimes it snags and kinks the line).

When the slickline parts, this can create an expensive 'fishing' job. It is called fishing because you often have to try different 'fishing' tools until you get a 'bite', then you have to work the original tools downhole free, or cut off the slickline where they join the tools downhole so that you can pull the broken slickline back to surface and out of the way, in order to fish the stuck toolstring. Because of the downtime involved in 'fishing', meaning not being able to flow the oil/gas well, the client is losing money by lack of production and also the cost of the slickline unit to fish, and the cost of what is left in the hole if it is not fished out (in the oil/gas industry, if the cause of the fishing job was not the fault of the slickline company, the oil/gas company is usually responsible to pay for it, and it can be very expensive).

Slickline was originally called measuring line, because the line was flat like a tape measure, and marked with depth increments so the operators would know how deep in the hole they were. This probably changed because the flat measuring line wasn't as strong as the modern slickline, and separate depth counters were developed.
It is advantageous to keep the diameter of the wire as small as possible for the following reasons:

* It reduces the load of its own weight.
* It can be run over smaller diameter sheaves, and wound on smaller diameter spools or reels without overstressing by bending (where the wire bends makes it weaker. Where it makes a complete circle, such as a counter wheel, makes it weaker yet).
* It keeps the reel drum size to a minimum (which reduces the area needed in the back of the slickline unit to house the drum and hydraulic pump, reducing weight and leaving more room for the other specialized equipment needed for slickline operations).
* It provides a small cross-section area for operation under pressure.

The disadvantage of a smaller diameter slickline is the lower strength. Depth and the nature of the job (a tool that must be pulled hard or might be stuck) will affect what slickline truck (different trucks specialize in different sizes of line) used.

The sizes of solid wireline in most common uses are: 0.092", 0.108", 0.125", 0.140", 0.150", and 0.160" in diameter, and are obtainable from the wire-drawing mills in one-piece standard lengths of 18,000, 20,000, 25,000 and 30,000 foot lengths. Other diameters and lengths are usually available on request from the suppliers, with the largest size currently available at 0.188".

==Mechanical and Hydraulic Jars==
Slickline tools operate with a mechanical action, controlled from surface in the wireline trucks operators compartment. Typically, this mechanical action is accomplished by the operation of jars. There are generally two types of jars; mechanical and hydraulic.

Mechanical jars look like a long, tubular piece of machined metal that slides longer or shorter approximately 75% to 90% of its total length. They give the effect of hammering on the downhole tools. The weight or hit of the 'hammer' depends on how much sinker bar is added above the jars. Generally, a slickline operator controls the downhole tools with taps and hits from the sinker bar via the mechanical jars, controlled at surface by lowering or raising the toolstring and monitoring weight, depth, and pressure. Mechanical jars for slickline can hit up or down the hole, making them a versatile form of jarring.

Hydraulic jars for slickline are generally meant to jar up only, because not enough sinker bar is able to feasibly be lubricated in to jar down on the downhole tools. Hydraulic jars work by the operator pulling up on the line, which puts an upward force on the top of the hydraulic jars. The bottom of the hydraulic jars is usually attached by threaded connection to the mechanical jars, which are attached to the downhole tools. Depending on how hard the operator pulls on the hydraulic jars will affect how fast they hit, and how hard they hit. When the top is pulled on, the inner mandrel begins to slide upwards. It has a restriction in it that [[hydraulic fluid]] has to bypass as it is pulled upwards, until it reaches an area of no restriction, allowing it to slide rapidly. The reason for the initial tighter restriction is to allow the operator to pull his line to the desired hitting range.

Generally once he hits that range on his weight indicator, he waits while the jars open to the less restricted point, whereupon the sinker bar travels upwards rapidly, providing an upwards hit on the downhole tools. The jars can then be 'reset' by lowering the line until the weight of the sinker bar closes, or pushes the inner mandrel of the hydraulic jars back to the starting position. Because the hydraulic jars are designed to provide a wait time to allow the operator to get up to the desired line tension, they can provide a very effective upwards hit.

Mechanical jar and hydraulic jar hitting power is affected by the length of the jars (the longer the length, they faster they can travel before they stop), the mass of the weight above them (the more the mass, the harder they will hit), and the tension of the line pulling on them.

Some completion components may be deployed and retrieved on slickline such as wireline retrievable [[Downhole safety valve|safety valves]], battery powered downhole gauges, perforating, placing explosively set bridge plugs, and placing or retrieving [[gas lift]] valves.  Slickline can also be used for fishing, the process of trying to retrieve other equipment and wire, which has been dropped down the hole.

==Applications==
The most common applications for slickline are:

* Tagging T.D. (Total Depth, which is the furthest depth possible down the wellbore)
* Gauge Ring runs (which is running a special sized downhole tool called a gauge ring, which comes in various pre-machined diameters, designed to ensure the pipe is clear to a certain point)
*Tubing Broach / Plunger Installations (a tubing broach looks like an aggressive, tubular file, available in different diameters, used for removing burrs and crimps in the inside of tubing and casing in oil and gas wells)[[File:Slickline_Tubing_Broach.jpg|thumb|right|Tubing Broach]]
* Bailing sand and debris (removing formation sand/rock and other such debris left over from the drilling and completion of the well, using a specialized tool called a bailer. This tool uses either a Chinese water pump type stroke action or a hydrostatic vacuum action to suction up the downhole debris, allowing it to be conveyed back to surface via the wireline)
* Shifting sleeves (formations downhole can be isolated behind sliding metal 'windows' called sliding sleeves. They are shifted open or closed by means of a specialized shifting tool locating the sleeve and it being jarred up or down, providing access or closing off that formation or section of casing)
* Setting / Pulling plugs and chokes (specialized downhole tools which either lock into pre-machined restrictions in the tubing, or which lock into the tubing itself, sealing pressure from below or above the plug)
* Setting / Pulling gas lift valves
* Running tailpipes (tubing extensions where the tubing is not landed close enough to the formation perforations in the casing)
* Bottom hole pressure  and temperature surveys (specialized electronic and mechanical tools designed to measure the pressure and temperature at predetermined depths in the wellbore. This data can be used to determine reservoir life)
* Spinner Surveys (to determine which formation perforations have the best inflow / which perforations make the most water / liquids)
* Kinley perforator, sandline cutter, and caliper
* Running production logging tools
* Fishing operations (fishing usually refers to attempting to retrieve lost tools or wire, or other debris that was not intended to restrict the flow / disrupt the well operations. Fishing can be difficult, due the fish being downhole, and other affecting conditions such as high pressure, the fish being jammed in the tubing / casing)
* Paraffin cutting (making a hole through and removing a wax buildup, which is a byproduct of oil cooling too much to reach surface)
* Chipping ice / salt (restrictions and plugs which can be formed as by products of a flowing well)
* Lubricating long assemblies in and out of the hole (lubricating is done via a larger than tool overall diameter pipe, joined at surface on top of the wellhead, which houses the valve that shuts the pressure in downhole. The lubricator should be long enough to be able to swallow the toolstring and downhole tools that are to be run or pulled)

==Braided line==
Braided line is generally used when the strength of slickline is insufficient for the task.  Most commonly, this is for heavy fishing such as retrieving broken drill pipe.

==Slickline Tools==

===Jar===
This type of tool can be extended and closed rapidly to induce a mechanical shock to the tool string.  This shock can induce certain components such as plugs to lock into place and then unlock for retrieving. Jars are commonly used to shear small brass or steel pins that are put in place to function certain down-hole tools at a certain moment. The operator can use the jars to shear the pins at a predetermined depth. Spang jars are manually operated by the wireline operator who either lifts or lowers wire rapidly, requiring a great deal of expertise.

===Stem===
Stem essentially just serves to add weight to the toolstring.  The weight may be necessary to overcome the pressure of the well.  Some variations of stem, called roller stem, may have wheels built into the tool to allow the tool string to glide more easily down moderately deviated wells. Stem give the hammering action to the tool string which in turn allows the jars to transmit the force given by the movement of the stems bars.  Depending on well conditions, either extra small OD stems are use or extra large.  The range can be from .75" to 3.50" OD and the stems normally come in 2&amp;nbsp;ft, 3&amp;nbsp;ft or 5&amp;nbsp;ft lengths.  The connection to the rope socket or other tools can be a threaded connection or a QLS system (quick connect).

===Pulling tools===
These are tools designed for fishing other wireline components which have been dropped or placed in the well down hole.  All wireline tools are designed with 'fishing necks' on their top side, intended to be easily grabbed by pulling tools with a matching 'id' to that of the 'od' of the fishing neck.  Pulling tools are also used for retrieving seated components such as plug prongs. Almost all pulling tools are equipped with a safety feature (shear pin) so they may release a stuck tool and allow the tool string to be brought to the surface for changes in components (hydraulic jars for example).

===Gauge Cutter (Gauge Ring)===
A gauge cutter is a tool with a round, open-ended bottom which is milled to an accurate size. Large openings above the bottom of the tool allow for fluid bypass while running in the hole.
Most often a gauge ring will be the first tool ran on a slickline operation. A gauge ring that is just undersized will allow the operator to ensure clear tubing down to the deepest projected working depth; for example 2 7/8" tubing containing 2.313" profiles would call for a gauge ring between 2.25" - 2.30". 
A gauge ring can also be used to remove light paraffin that may have built up in the tubing. Often a variety of different sized gauges and/or scratchers will be run to remove parafin little by little.Gauge cutter can be used for drift runs also.

===Lead impression block===
If an obstruction is found downhole, a lead impression block can be run to help determine its nature.  The LIB has a malleable lead base in which the obstruction can leave an impression when they meet. 
The LIB is called Wireline Camera because of its function to mark any object downhole.
They are also sometimes called "confusion" blocks because they only give a two-dimensional view of the down-hole object, making it hard for an inexperienced person to determine what three-dimensional object is in the hole

===Downhole bailer===
Bailers are downhole tools that are generally long and tubular shaped, and are used for both getting samples of downhole solids (sand, scale, asphaltines, rust, rubber and debris from well servicing operations) and for 'bailing' the unwanted downhole solids from the well. Bailers are attached either via threaded connection or releasable downhole tool to the wireline toolstring, and are manipulated from surface by the wireline operator. Bailers usually have an interchangeable bottom (the shoe) which also houses a check to keep the solids from falling or washing out of the bottom.

===Sample bailer===
A sample bailer is generally around a meter long, and has a hollow tube (the barrel) usually around 40&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, with a 'ball check' on the bottom and an opening at the top. This tool is beat downwards into the as yet unknown obstruction using the mechanical jars and weight above of the wireline toolstring. Generally, after a predetermined amount of 'hits', hopefully allowing a usable sample of solids to fill the barrel. When the tool is pulled upwards, the solids usually (hopefully) settle the ball check onto its 'seat', which will keep the solids in the barrel during the return trip to surface, where the solids can be inspected to determine what the downhole obstruction was. This procedure can be 'hit and miss', the success depending on how readily the solid was accepted into the barrel, and if the ball check was properly seated on the return trip to surface. If the ball check is not seated (sometimes a large, hard piece of solid will sit in between the ball and seat) downhole fluids tend to 'wash' the sample out of the bottom of the sample bailer, leaving the inspectors at surface wondering if the tool actually collected a sample. Persistence is generally a good rule of thumb with this tool.

===Stroke bailer===
A stroke bailer functions like a 'Chinese water pump', and is used to collect unwanted solids from the wellbore. A stroke bailer is long and tubular looking, with a smaller rod that extends from the top, a hole in the bottom, and is generally around 7 meters long, but the length depends on how much barrel section is added to the bailer. The barrel 'free floats' on the stroke rod, which is attached to the wireline toolstring. The tool is usually 'spudded' into the downhole solid, then the wireline toolstring is pulled upwards, which in turn pulls the stroke up through the barrel. Ideally, this draws the downhole solid in through the bottom 'shoe' of the tool, past the check and into the barrel for collection. The tool is usually stroked either a predetermined number of times, or until it appears the tool is not stroking, which can mean either it is full, or stuck.

===Hydrostatic bailer===
A hydrostatic bailer functions like a 'vacuum', and is used to suck up unwanted solids from the wellbore. A hydrostatic bailer is generally around 2.5 meters long and is tubular looking, with two 10&amp;nbsp;mm holes on opposing sides at the top of the tool, and a hole in the bottom. A hydrostatic bailer uses a pinned plug with o-ring seals at the bottom, and a plug at the top to maintain the surface pressure that it was assembled at (nominally around 100 kPa) all the way to the bottom of the well, whereupon it is spudded into the downhole solids, which ideally pushes the shoe into the bottom plug, which shears the pin on the bottom plug. An oil or gas well's pressure downhole is always more than atmospheric pressure at surface, due to the formation pressure, and a combination of depth and hydrostatic weight of wellbore fluids. Sometimes fluid will be added to the wellbore to assist in bailing by bringing up the pressure, and also lubricating the downhole solid. Because the pressure inside the bailer is much less than the downhole wellbore pressure, any solids that are loose enough are 'sucked up' by the vacuum formed when the bottom plug is sheared and travels upwards through the barrel, followed by the solids. At the same time, due to the changed from negative pressure to positive pressure, the top plug pops out (and is caught by the top part of the tool), and excess flow is directed out through the 10&amp;nbsp;mm ports on the sides of the top of the tool. These ports allow the barrel to fill more readily. Then the bailer is returned to surface where it is taken apart, the solids are emptied, and it is cleaned and serviced with new o-ring seals. Care must be taken when disassembling at surface as the tool is potentially charged with the downhole pressure (possibly many tens of thousands of kpa) and may 'blow apart' when being unthreaded if not bled off first.

===Running Tools===
These tools are primarily used to 'set' plugs into locking profiles (nipples) located in the tubing; however, the term 'running tool' refers to a downhole tool attached to the wireline toolstring that is used to 'run' another tool that is meant to be left downhole when the toolstring returns to surface. In general, a running tool is attached to a downhole 'locking tool' that locates and locks into the selected downhole profile (nipple). The 'locking tool', or 'lock' for short, can be attached via threaded connection to the top of a variety of different tools, including but not limited to, downhole chokes (flow rate restrictors sized according to a pre-determined calculation), one-way check valves (TKX style plugs), instrument hangers, and most commonly, tubing plugs. The lock is fitted onto the running tool and attached using shear pins made of brass or steel. When the target profile is reached the lock can be set by seating the lock into the profile using mechanical jars (spangs) until the locking keys have locked the lock into the profile, whereupon the operator usually 'pull tests' the lock to give an indication it is properly 'set', then shears off the shear pins with his mechanical or hydraulic jars to allow the 'toolstring' to return to surface. There are many different types of running tools, some are mechanically complex and able to be made 'selective' in order to pass through profiles in order to reach one of the same size but a different depth; some are relatively simple, such as an 'F' collarstop running tool, which is essentially a metal rod which fits inside the collarstop downhole tool which is pinned in place.

The '''soil seed bank''' is the natural storage of [[seed]]s, often dormant, within the [[soil]] of most [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name="dekker"/&gt;  The study of soil seed banks started in 1859 when [[Charles Darwin]] observed the emergence of seedlings using soil samples from the bottom of a lake. The first scientific paper on the subject was published in 1882 and reported on the occurrence of seeds at different soil depths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0103-90161998000500013&amp;script=sci_arttext  P.J. Christoffoleti; R.S.X. Caetano 1998. Soil seed banks Scientia Agricola: 55: 74-78.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Weed seed banks have been studied intensely in [[agricultural science]] because of their important economic impacts; other fields interested in soil seed banks include [[silviculture|forest regeneration]] and [[restoration ecology]].

== Background ==

Many [[taxon|taxa]] have been classified according to the longevity of their seeds in the soil seed bank.  Seeds of ''transient'' species remain viable in the soil seed bank only to the next opportunity to germinate, while seeds of  ''persistent'' species can survive longer than the next opportunity—often much longer than one year.  Species with seeds that remain viable in the soil longer than five years form the ''long-term'' persistent seed bank, while species whose seeds generally germinate or die within one to five years are called ''short-term'' persistent. A typical long-term persistent species is ''[[Chenopodium album]]'' (Lambsquarters); its seeds commonly remain viable in the soil for up to 40 years and in rare situations perhaps as long as 1,600 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agron.iastate.edu/~weeds/weedbiollibrary/u4lq1.html  Iowa State University: College of Agriculture and Life Science: Lambsquarters]&lt;/ref&gt;   A species forming no soil seed bank at all (except the dry season between ripening and the first autumnal rains) is ''[[Agrostemma githago]]'' (Corncockle), which is a formerly widespread cereal weed.

== Seed longevity ==
[[File:DriedLotusSeeds.jpg|thumb|190px|Dried lotus seeds.]]
Longevity of seeds is very variable and depends on many factors; few species exceed 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Thompson, Jan P. Bakker, and Renée M. Bekker. 1997. The soil seed banks of north west Europe : methodology, density and longevity. New York : Cambridge University Press.  276 p.&lt;/ref&gt;  In typical soils the longevity of seeds can range from nearly zero (germinating immediately when reaching the soil or even before) to several hundred years. Some of the oldest still-viable seeds were those of [[Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus]] (''Nelumbo nucifera'') found buried in the soil of a pond; these seeds were estimated by [[carbon dating]] to be around 1,200 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aE414KuXu4gC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15|authors=J. Derek Bewley, Michael Black and Peter Halmer|title=The Encyclopedia of Seeds: Science, Technology and Uses|publisher=CABI|year=2006|pages=14–15|isbn=978-0851997230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the longest-running soil seed viability trials was started in [[Michigan]] in 1879 by [[William James Beal|James Beal]]. The experiment involved the burying of 20 bottles holding 50 seeds from 21 species. Every five years, a bottle from every species was retrieved and germinated on a tray of sterilized soil which was kept in a growth chamber. Later, after responsibility for managing the experiment was delegated to caretakers, the period between retrievals became longer. In 1980, more than 100 years after the trial was started, seeds of only three species were observed to germinate: [[Verbascum blattaria|moth mullein]] (''Verbascum blattaria''), [[Verbascum thapsus|common mullein]] (''Verbascum thapsus'') and [[Malva neglecta|common mallow]] (''Malva neglecta'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frank W. Telewski|url=http://www.cpa.msu.edu/beal/research/research_frames.htm|title=Research &amp; Teaching|publisher=Department of Plant Biology, Michigan State University|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental significance ==

Soil seed banks play an important role in the [[natural environment]] of many ecosystems. For example, the rapid re-vegetation of sites disturbed by wildfire, catastrophic weather, agricultural operations, and timber harvesting is largely due to the soil seed bank.  [[Forest ecosystem]]s and  [[wetland]]s contain a number of specialized plant species forming persistent soil seed banks.

Before the advent of herbicides a good example of a persistent seed bank species, [[Papaver rhoeas]] sometimes was so abundant in agricultural fields in Europe that it could be mistaken for a crop.

The absence of a soil seed bank impedes the establishment of vegetation during [[primary succession]], while presence of a well-stocked soil seed bank permits rapid development of species-rich ecosystems during [[secondary succession]].

== Population densities and diversity ==

The mortality of seeds in the soil is one of the key factors for the persistence and density fluctuations of plant populations, especially for annual plants. Studies on the genetic structure of  ''Androsace septentrionalis'' populations in the seed bank compared to those of established plants showed that diversity within populations is higher below ground than above ground.

There are indications that mutations are more important for species forming a persistent seed bank compared to those with only transient seeds. The increase of species richness in a plant community due to a species-rich and abundant soil seed bank is known as the ''storage effect''.

Species of ''[[Striga]]'' (witchweed) are known to leave some of the highest seed densities in the soil compared to other plant [[genera]]; this is a major factor that aids their invasive potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Merrill A.|last1=Ross|first2=Carole A.|last2=Lembi|title=Applied Weed Science: Including the Ecology and Management of Invasive Plants|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2008|page=22|isbn=978-0135028148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each plant has the capability to produce between 90,000 and 450,000 seeds, although a majority of these seeds are not viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Faiz F. Bebawi, Robert E. Eplee and Rebecca S. Norris|title=Effects of Seed Size and Weight on Witchweed (Striga asiatica) Seed Germination, Emergence, and Host-Parasitization|jstor=4043831|journal=Weed Science|volume=32|date=March 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that only two witchweeds would produce enough seeds required to refill a seed bank after seasonal losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Daniel M. Joel, [[Jonathan Gressel]], Lytton J. Musselman|title=Parasitic Orobanchaceae: Parasitic Mechanisms and Control Strategies|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JW9EAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA394&amp;lpg=PA394|page=394|year=2013|isbn=9783642381461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated ecosystem processes ==
The term '''soil [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspore]] bank''' can be used to include non-flowering plants such as [[fern]]s and [[bryophyte]]s.

In addition to seeds, [[perennial plant]]s have vegetative [[propagule]]s to facilitate forming new plants, migration into new ground, or reestablishment after being top-killed.  These propagules are collectively called the 'soil bud bank', and include dormant and adventitious [[buds]] on [[stolons]], [[rhizomes]], and [[bulb]]s.&lt;ref name="dekker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agron-www.agron.iastate.edu/~weeds/Ag317/bioeco/lifecycle/seedbank.html|title=The Soil Seed Bank|publisher=Agronomy Department, Iowa State University|author=Jack Dekker|year=1997|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Te-Tzu Chang''' or '''T. T. Chang''' ({{zh|s=张德慈|t=張德慈|p=Zhāng Décí}}; 1927—2006) was a prominent [[Chinese people|Chinese]] agricultural and environmental scientist.

== Biography ==
Chang was born in Shanghai on April 3, 1927 to a "scholar-gentry" family. Chang's father graduated from the [[Saint John's University, Shanghai|Saint John's University]] in Shanghai and won the [[Boxer Rebellion Indemnity Scholarship Program]] and completed his study in the [[United States]]. Chang had three (older) sisters and one (younger) brother.&lt;ref name="Chang bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seed.agron.ntu.edu.tw/cropsci/rice/TT%20Chang.htm |title=張德慈院士生平簡介(Brief Introduction to T.T. Chang's Life) |author=謝兆樞 |publisher=[[National Taiwan University]] |accessdate=May 17, 2010|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chang finished his secondary education at the Saint John's School (a [[middle school]] afflicted to the Saint John's University) in Shanghai. Chang at beginning studied agricultural science at the Saint John's University in Shanghai, which was his father's [[alma mater]]. After about one year, Chang transferred to the [[University of Nanking]] in [[Nanjing]] and majored in [[agriculture]] and [[horticulture]]. Chang graduated from University of Nanking with BSA in 1949.&lt;ref name="Chang bio"/&gt;

After graduation, Chang worked for the [[Council of Agriculture (Republic of China)|Council of Agriculture]] in [[Guangzhou]], the capital city of [[Guangdong Province]]. During this period of time [[Shen Tsung-han]] (1895–1980, [[:zh:沈宗瀚|沈宗瀚]], born [[Ningbo]], [[Zhejiang]]; death [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]) was one of his mentors. Shen was the second and former [[Director-general]] of the Council of Agriculture.&lt;ref name="Chang bio"/&gt;

In 1950, Chang moved to [[Taiwan]] and served as a technician in the Ministry of Agriculture. Recommended by Shen, in 1952 Chang went to study plant genetics at [[Cornell University]] which was also the alma mater of Shen (Shen received his [[PhD]] from Cornell). Chang obtained his MSc from Cornell in 1954 and continued his study at the [[University of Minnesota]] where he earned PhD in 1959.&lt;ref name="Chang bio"/&gt;

Chang went back to Taiwan in 1959. However, after two years of staying in Taiwan, Chang moved to [[Philippines]] and worked for the [[International Rice Research Institute]] (IRRI) in [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]]. From 1962 to 1991, Chang managed the International Rice Germplasm Center.

The ''T. T. Chang Genetic Resources Center'' is named after him.&lt;ref name="Chang pdf bio"/&gt;

It is the toxicological subdiscipline of [[pharmacogenomics]], which is broadly defined as the study of inter-individual variations in whole-genome or candidate gene [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] maps, [[haplotype]] markers, and alterations in [[gene expression]] that might correlate with drug responses.&lt;ref name="pmid15340386"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lesko LJ, Woodcock J | title = Translation of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics: a regulatory perspective | journal = Nature Reviews.

In pharmaceutical [[drug discovery]] and [[drug development|development]], toxicogenomics is used to study possible [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse]] (i.e. [[toxic]]) effects of pharmaceutical [[drug]]s in defined [[model organism|model systems]] in order to draw conclusions on the toxic risk to patients or the environment. Both the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) currently preclude basing regulatory decision-making on genomics data alone. However, they do encourage the voluntary submission of well-documented, quality genomics data. Both agencies are considering the use of submitted data on a case-by-case basis for assessment purposes (e.g., to help elucidate mechanism of action or contribute to a weight-of-evidence approach) or for populating relevant comparative databases by encouraging parallel submissions of genomics data and traditional toxicological test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corvi R, Ahr HJ, Albertini S, Blakey DH, Clerici L, Coecke S, Douglas GR, Gribaldo L, Groten JP, Haase B, Hamernik K, Hartung T, Inoue T, Indans I, Maurici D, Orphanides G, Rembges D, Sansone SA, Snape JR, Toda E, Tong W, van Delft JH, Weis B, Schechtman LM | title = Meeting report: Validation of toxicogenomics-based test systems: ECVAM-ICCVAM/NICEATM considerations for regulatory use | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 114 | issue = 3 | pages = 420–9 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16507466 | pmc = 1392237 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.8247 | url = http://www.ehponline.org/members/2005/8247/8247.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081017084247/http://www.ehponline.org/members/2005/8247/8247.html | archivedate = 2008-10-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universidad de Concepción''' ('''UdeC'''), is a traditional Chilean private university, the work of the Penquista community, one of the most traditional and prestigious in its country, considered complex due to its extensive research in the various areas of knowledge. Founded on May 14, 1919, it is the 3rd oldest university in Chile, and 1 of the 25 universities belonging to the Council of Rectors of Chilean Universities.

Its headquarters are located in the city of Concepción, and also has 2 other campuses in [[Chillán]] and [[Los Ángeles (Chile)|Los Ángeles]]. In a citizen survey carried out in 2012, it was chosen as the symbol that most identifies Penquists.

It was the 1st University created in the center-south zone of the country, besides being the 1st to be constituted as a private law corporation and belong to the Cruz del Sur University Network; it also belongs to the G9 University Network. The University of Concepción also had a pioneering role in the reform movement of Chilean universities that took place at the end of the 60's of the 20th century. It was the 1st Chilean university that approved the University Reform in that period (1968), giving greater participation to students in university management.

Its main promoter was Chilean educator and lawyer Enrique Molina Garmendia, who sought to create the 1st secular university in Chile. As part of its educational line, the University of Concepción devotes a large part of its budget to academic research. It has in its facilities the most complete museum of Chilean art in the country, several sports centers and a network of 11 libraries, the main one occupying an area of 10,000 m² with a total of 100,000 volumes.

By 2012, the total number of graduates of this house of studies amounted to 57,000. It also teaches 23,700 students, 2,166 of them graduate programs; 72% of its professors have doctorates or master's degrees and its infrastructure, with 243,556 m² built, is one of the largest in Chile.

It is currently accredited by the National Accreditation Commission (CNA-Chile) for the maximum period of 7 years (of a maximum of 7), from November 2016 to November 2023. Figure in the 3rd position within the Chilean universities according to the webometric classification of the CSIC (July 2017) and in the 3rd position according to the AméricaEconomía 2017 ranking as well as national and international rankings. Within the Chilean universities, it is also among the 11 that figure in the QS 2017 world university ranking, among the 10 that appear in the Times Higher Education 2017 ranking, and among the 25 that appear in the ranking of Scimago Institution Rankings (SIR) 2017, with the 3rd position nationally and 572th worldwide.

Its Concepción campus was declared a National Heritage in 2016 by the Council of National Monuments of Chile; what makes it the 1st and only University in Chile to have this recognition due to the design and architectural style of its environment that has been implemented in its buildings and campus-level environment since its foundation; the proclamation grants the university special protection and conservation of the campus and its space by the state; therefore, any intervention to the same has to be reported to the Council of Monuments, while any damage and type of vandalism that jeopardizes the integrity and security of the campus will be seriously penalized according to the law that regulates and covers the National Monuments, as well as the prompt construction of the 1st and only Bío Bío Technological Science Park (PACYT) in all of Chile located in the Bío-Bío Region, near the campus of the Universidad de Concepción; which at the same time will be in charge of the administration, organization, and projection of new ideas with a view to the future of it together with the Government of Chile; this initiative is going to be projected as a productive space of the future and a relevant pole of the development of the country, the place where all the creative potential will be housed, knowledge and innovations of high impact will be generated.

==History==
[[File:Escultura en UConce.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Sculpture in honor of the founders of the University at the University Forum.]]

===Background===
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many scholars from [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] started to plead for the construction of a university for the south of [[Chile]] where it would be possible to study professional degrees outside the capital, [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]]. However, a project of this magnitude required a high level of organization, which as yet did not exist. In February 1917, the newspaper [[El Sur (newspaper)|El Sur]] reported:
{{quote|''The idea of creating a university cannot yet be possible because of "the lack of organization of those who want to create it".''|[[El Sur (newspaper)|Diario El Sur]], 1917.}}

===Committee Pro-University===
On March 23, 1917, the first official meeting took place to realise two dreams of the citizens of Concepción: a clinical hospital and a university.

After debate, a committee was named to take charge of the construction of these two projects. The projects were closely related because the hospital would become the base of the new university's medical school. Some notable members of the committee included Enrique Molina Garmendia, Pedro Nolasco, Edmundo Larenas and Virginio Gómez.

===Foundation===
The commission then presented the documentation to [[National Congress of Chile|Congress]] that would officially create the university. These were sent and approved, and on May 14, 1919, Enrique Molina Garmendia founded the university and became its first rector.

Nowadays, the university is funded by various organisations belonging to the "University of Concepción Corporation". The Lottery is one of the main organisations. With this funding, the University of Concepción has become one of the most modern and important universities in Chile.

==Organization==

The University of Concepción is divided into three campuses, located in [[Chillán]], [[Los Ángeles, Chile|Los Ángeles]] and [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]. The latter is the main and most important campus.

===Concepción Campus===

[[File:Arco de Medicina UdeC.jpg|thumb|right|The Arc of Medicine, at the entrance of the Concepción Campus]]
The university is located in the University District. The whole campus comprises what is known as the '''Ciudad Universitaria''' (University City), which also contains museums, sculptures and parks. Today, the campus has an area of 1,425,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, of which 239,856 are built upon. It is the knowledge, science, culture, technology and research centre of the city of [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]. The ''[[Presencia de América Latina]]'' mural by [[Jorge González Camarena]] is within the [[Casa del Arte (Concepción, Chile)|Casa del Arte]] on the university campus.

In 2010, the University of Concepción campus was named one of Chile’s most important architectural works from the first half of the 20th century. The "Obra Bicentenario" award distinguishes works that, in the last 100 years, have changed the face of Chile’s cities and most improved the quality of life of its inhabitants.

===Chillán Campus===

The Chillán campus was founded in 1955 with the support of many institutions such as the [[United Nations]], the [[Organization of American States|OAS]], American and European universities, and others. It mainly focuses on agricultural sciences and has approximately 2,000 students, more than 100 academic staff and 250 administrative staff |http://www.chillan.udec.cl |.

===Los Ángeles Campus===

The Los Ángeles campus was founded in 1962 at the request of the people of the province to the university rector, David Stitchkin Branover. Currently, it has 1,300 students and 35 full-time teachers, plus other part-time academic staff.

{{Renewable energy sources}}
A '''wave farm''' – or '''wave power farm''' or '''wave energy park''' – is a collection of machines in the same location and used for the [[generation]] of [[wave power]] [[electricity]]. Wave farms can be either offshore or nearshore, with the former the most promising for the production of large quantities of electricity for the grid. The first wave farm was constructed in Portugal, the Aguçadoura Wave Farm, consisting of three Pelamis machines. The world's largest is planned for Scotland.

==United Kingdom==

===Scotland===
Funding for a wave farm in [[Scotland]] was announced on February 20, 2007 by the [[Scottish Executive]], at a cost of over [[pound sterling|£]]4 million, as part of a £13 million funding packages for [[Renewable energy in Scotland#Wave power|marine power in Scotland]]. The farm will be the world's largest with a capacity of 3MW generated by four Pelamis machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6377423.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Orkney to get 'biggest' wave farm | date=February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Renewable energy in Scotland]].

[[Ocean Power Technologies]] (OPT), based in [[Pennington, New Jersey]] is involved in the development of a wave farm off '''[[Cromarty Firth]]'''.  The PB150 [[PowerBuoy]] was successfully deployed at sea in 2011 by a team including Scotland-based Global Maritime Scotland Ltd, Port Services (Invergordon) Ltd and OPT, with the support of the Cromarty Firth Port Authority.

The £10 million Saltire prize challenge will be awarded to the first to be able to generate 100 GWh from wave power over a continuous two-year period by 2017 (about 5.7 MW average).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/28/orkney-green-energy-wave-power Orkney, leader in green energy, launches wave power competition]&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
Funding for a wave farm known as [[Wave hub]] off the north coast of [[Cornwall]], [[England]] was approved in June 2007. The [[Wave hub]] operates as an extension cable allowing developers to install and operate wave energy generating devices while keeping down connection costs. Four device operators have expressed an interest in using the site which will initially allow up to 20MW of wave energy capacity.

[[Ocean Power Technologies]] (OPT), based in [[Pennington, New Jersey]] is involved in [[Wave Hub]]. Located in [[Cornwall, England]], OPT aims to develop its [[PowerBuoy]] technology, an innovative renewable energy project, and expects to create the UK's first offshore facility for the demonstration and proving of arrays of [[wave energy]] generation devices.

A 2017 study estimates that commercial wave farms are not close to being feasible.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/uk-wave-energy-startups-have-failed-on-their-promises&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://strathcloud.sharefile.eu/app?/#/share/view/sfa07a0e490740cea&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
[[Wave power in the United States]] is under development in several locations off the east &amp; west coasts as well as Hawaii. It has moved beyond the research phase and major installations are planned to come on-line within the next few years. Its use to-date has been for situations where other forms of energy production are not economically viable and as such, the power output is currently modest.

According to the president of trade association Ocean Renewable Energy Coalition, “The total potential off the coast of the United States is 252 million megawatt hours a year.”&lt;ref&gt;Wave Farms Show Energy Potential

&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the absence of current implementation of major projects, there has been significant investment on the part of public utility companies and federal funds for the implementation and economic viability of two new wave power energy centers as of September 30, 2008.

On December 18, 2007 the [[Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company]], the largest national utility company, announced a commercial agreement to purchase power generated by wave energy. This decision was made in part to be competitive in the public electrical energy market in the state of California under stringent [[renewable energy]] restrictions. Currently, California state law requires that publicly owned utilities are required to generate 20% of their electricity from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and wave power by 2010. After the General Election on November 4, 2008 this law may be subject to change to an even more stringent law, which states that publicly owned utilities would be required to increase their proportion of electricity from renewable resources to 20% by 2010, 40% by 2020 and 50% by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;Proposition 7 Renewable Energy Generation State of California http://www.smartvoter.org/2008/11/04/ca/state/prop/7/&lt;/ref&gt;

Federally, under the Marine Renewable Energy Research and Development Act of 2007 the United States has committed $200 million in federal funds toward wave energy technology to be allocated from 2008 through 2012. The [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) is currently responsible for the allocation of $50 million per fiscal year for research, development, demonstration and commercial application of ocean energy.&lt;ref&gt;Wave Energy Bill Approved by U.S. House Science Committee http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2007/06/wave-energy-bill-approved-by-u-s-house-science-committee-48984.html
June 18, 2007
&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2008, the first year of federal allocation toward wave energy, there are a total of fourteen recipients. The most notable recipients of this year include Oregon State University and the University of Hawaii. Oregon State University in partnership with the University of Washington, will implement the development of the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center for wave and tidal energy. The second recipient, University of Hawaii will develop and implement the National Renewable Marine Energy Center in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;DOE announces first marine renewable energy grants

&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grays Harbor Ocean Energy Company]] of Seattle has applied to the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] for permits to harness energy from waves off the coastline of California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island. The $28 billion project would be the largest renewable energy project in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28113042/|title=$28 billion in wave energy projects proposed|date=Dec 8, 2008|publisher=The Associated Press|accessdate=2008-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Ocean Power Technologies]] (O.P.T.), based in [[Pennington, New Jersey]] is involved in the following wave projects in the US:
* '''LEAP Autonomous [[PowerBuoy]], New Jersey''' - O.P.T. has successfully operated an autonomous PowerBuoy® off New Jersey, designed and manufactured by O.P.T. under the US Navy’s Littoral Expeditionary Autonomous PowerBuoy (LEAP) program for coastal security and maritime surveillance.
* '''Coos Bay, Oregon''' - O.P.T. is proposing to develop a utility-scale, commercial wave park in North America at [[Coos Bay, Oregon]]. The planned size of this park is up to 100 megawatts, and it will be the largest wave energy project in the world when it is completed
* '''Reedsport, Oregon''' - O.P.T. is developing a commercial wave park on the west coast of the United States located 2.5 miles offshore near [[Reedsport, Oregon]]. The first phase of this project is for ten PB150 [[PowerBuoy]]s, or 1.5 megawatts.&lt;ref name="Reeds03102012"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidferris/2012/10/03/in-wave-energy-oregon-races-to-catch-up-to-europe/?ss=business:energy] US catching up with Europe - Forbes October 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Reedsport wave farm is now scheduled for installation spring 2013.&lt;ref name="Reeds04102012"&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2012/10/setback_arises_for_wave-power.html] Reedsport project delayed due to early onset of winter weather - OregonLive Oct 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Oahu, Hawaii''' - From 2009 to 2011, O.P.T. ocean-tested its PowerBuoy at the US Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) at Kaneohe Bay. The [[Oahu]] [[PowerBuoy]] was launched under the Company's program with the US Navy for ocean testing and demonstration of PowerBuoys, including connection to the Oahu grid.
* '''Atlantic City, New Jersey''' - The prototype project, wherein the principles demonstrated with the PB40 prototype [[PowerBuoy]] deployed and tested off the coast of Atlantic City were integrated into the designs of the buoys for Hawaii, Spain, and PB150 PowerBuoys.

The [[Mutriku Breakwater Wave Plant]] is the world´s first breakwater wave plant with a multiple turbine arrangement. It is located in the Mutriku´s dike and has been producing electrical energy since July 2011. The plant has a capacity of 296&amp;nbsp;kW from 16 turbines and 16 OWCs.&lt;ref name="mutriku"&gt;http://www.eve.eus/EVE/media/EVE/pdf/Mutriku-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During the winter 2015, the plant supplied its first GWh to the grid. This up-and-running power plant is available as a test site where different researchers can test their WOC based generators.

==Portugal==
The [[Aguçadoura Wave Farm]] was the world's first commercial-scale wave farm.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=25 Sept 2008|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/25/greentech.alternativeenergy | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Alok|last=Jha|date=September 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was located {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} offshore near [[Póvoa de Varzim]] north of [[Oporto]] in [[Portugal]]. The farm used three [[Pelamis wave energy converter|Pelamis]] wave energy converters to convert the motion of the [[ocean surface wave]]s into electricity, totalling to 2.25[[Megawatt|MW]] in total installed capacity. The farm first generated electricity into the Portuguese grid in July 2008&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pelamiswave.com/news?archive=1&amp;mm=7&amp;yy=2008&lt;/ref&gt; and was officially opened on September 23, 2008, by the Portuguese Minister of Economy.&lt;ref name="gov.pt"&gt;{{cite web|title=23 de Setembro de 2008|url=http://www.portugal.gov.pt/portal/pt/comunicacao/agenda/20080923.htm|publisher=[[Government of Portugal]]|accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Making waves: UK firm harnesses power of the sea ... in Portugal | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/25/greentech.alternativeenergy | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate=2008-10-09 | location=London | first=Alok | last=Jha | date=2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wave farm was shut down two months after the official opening in November 2008 due to technical problems with the machines.&lt;ref name="Pelamis Sinks"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pelamis Sinks Portugal Wave Power|url=http://cleantech.com/news/4276/pelamis-sinks-portugal-wave-power-p|publisher=[[cleantech.com]]|accessdate=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321113455/http://www.cleantech.com/news/4276/pelamis-sinks-portugal-wave-power-p|archivedate=2009-03-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CEO Exits"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pelamis Wave Power Jettisons Its CEO, Rough Waters Ahead?|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/green-light/post/pelamis-wave-power-jettisons-its-ceo-rough-waters-ahead|publisher=[[greentechmedia.com]]|accessdate=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003125522/http://www.greentechmedia.com/green-light/post/pelamis-wave-power-jettisons-its-ceo-rough-waters-ahead|archivedate=2009-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
The company 40South Energy has its offshore test site in Castiglioncello, Italy, and plans to upgrade the site to a commercial Wave Energy Park by connecting it with an electrical cable to shore. In the meantime, the owners of an offshore aquaculture installation in Lavagna, Italy, are in the process of converting their concession from fish farming to fish farming plus electricity production. The technology used in this Wave Energy Park will come from 40South Energy.

==Russia==
In 2013, [[Ocean RusEnergy]] company, based in [[Yekaterinburg]], demonstrated a line of wave energy generators, ranging from 160W to 1MW(planned). Their modular design allows to assemble a wave power farm having a desired capacity. Unlike other wave power projects it targets small-scale and private electricity generation.&lt;ref name="offshore1"&gt;[http://www.offshorewind.biz/2013/04/22/russian-company-develops-mobile-wave-energy-generator/ Russian Company Develops Mobile Wave Energy Generator] offshorewind.biz&lt;/ref&gt;
