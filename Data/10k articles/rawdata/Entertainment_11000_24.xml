'''''After Dark''''' was an entertainment magazine that covered theatre, cinema, stage plays, ballet, performance art, and various artists, including singers, [[actor|actors and actresses]], and dancers, among others. First published in May 1968, the magazine succeeded ''Ballroom Dance Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;Back issue [http://www.creativevisionsbooks.com/camagaaft00000000na.html retail site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821210550/http://www.creativevisionsbooks.com/camagaaft00000000na.html |date=August 21, 2006 }}—intended as a reference for dates and images only. Note that some of the issue dates are incorrect; however, the listing correctly identifies Vol. 13 No. 01 as being published in May 1980. An online search in [http://www.bookfinder.com www.bookfinder.com] returns a September 1982 issue as the most recent one available, and lists the May 1976 issue as the Tenth Anniversary Issue.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=LC Online Catalog |title=After Dark |url=http://lccn.loc.gov/66086440 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713214558/http://lccn.loc.gov/66086440 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-13 |publisher=Library of Congress |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s Patrick Pacheco took over the editorship from William Como and strived for a time to make the magazine a more serious critical monthly with a greater emphasis on quality writing, abandoning color printing inside and reducing photos to a few inches square. This was a reaction to Como's "eye-candy" thrust, but sales were low and in 1981 Louis Miele replaced him at the helm and returned to the full-color format with plenty of skin on show. It seemed however that the day was done for ''After Dark'', perhaps because several newer magazines were now doing a better (and more explicitly targeted) job of appealing to the magazine's original readership, for Miele's incarnation of ''After Dark'' folded after only a couple of years, this time permanently.

The first issue does not say "Volume 1, no. 1", it says "Volume 10, no. 1".  This numbering continues through volume 13, no. 8, Dec. 1970, which is followed by volume 3, no. 9, Jan. 1971. (Volume 3 is thus actually the fourth volume.)&lt;ref&gt;Direct examination of the periodical.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
''After Dark'', founded by its first editor, [[William Como]], and Rudolph Orthwine (both of ''[[Dance Magazine]]''), covered a wide range of entertainment- or lifestyle-related topics. In addition to numerous articles on dance, topics ranged from a review of the stage production of the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' in the December 1968 issue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=Photos from After Dark Magazine - December 1968 | url=http://www.orlok.com/hair/holding/photographs/hair/afterdark.html | work=Hair Photo Index | date=5 March 2002 | accessdate=2009-01-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090118084034/http://www.orlok.com/hair/holding/photographs/hair/afterdark.html| archivedate= 18 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an article on [[Shirley Bassey]] in the January 1972 issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Norma McLain Stoop |title="They Can't Put the Two Together" ...and Bassey is Both |url=http://www.geocities.com/~sbwebmaster/articles/generalarticles/articleafterdark1972.html |work=After Dark |date=January 1972 |accessdate=2009-01-03 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kmD2648m?url=http://www.geocities.com/~sbwebmaster/articles/generalarticles/articleafterdark1972.html |archivedate=2009-10-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a cover photograph and feature article on [[Donna Summer]] in the April 1977 issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patrick Pacheco |title=Donna Summer: The Sensuous Diva of Sex Rock |url=http://www.donna-tribute.com/articles/70/afterdar.html |work= |date=April 1977 |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406200310/http://www.donna-tribute.com/articles/70/afterdar.html |archivedate=2009-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cover photos included [[Bette Midler]] (January 1973), [[Robert Redford]] (December 1973), [[Barbra Streisand]] (April 1975), [[Lauren Hutton]] (December 1976), [[Mae West]] (May 1977), [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]] (February 1978), [[Dolly Parton]] (April 1978), [[Jon Voight]] (April 1979), [[Christopher Reeve]] (October 1980), [[Lily Tomlin]] (February 1981), and [[Diana Ross]] (May 1981).  Best sold issue was the February 1976 Issue with Zarko Halmic, Bonita George and Bo van den Assum on the cover.

The May 1979 issue contained a profile of actor [[Philip Anglim]], who originated the [[role (performing arts)|role]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] of [[Joseph Merrick|John Merrick]] in ''[[The Elephant Man (play)|The Elephant Man]]'', a play by [[Bernard Pomerance]].&lt;ref name=ad197905&gt;{{cite news | author=John Gruen| title=Philip Anglim: The Elephant Man Girds His Loins | url= | work=After Dark | publisher=Danad Publishing Company, Inc.| pages=62–65 | date=May 1979 | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other profiles in that issue were of [[James Mason]], the actor who was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for his role as the husband of [[Judy Garland]] in the film ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]''&lt;ref&gt;Mewborn, Brant. "James Mason: Odd Man In". ''After Dark'', Danad Publishing Company, Inc., New York, 98 pp. May 1979, pp. 70–73&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marilyn Hassett]], who portrayed [[Jill Kinmont]] in ''[[The Other Side of the Mountain]]'', a film about skier Kinmont's accident that left her paralyzed.&lt;ref&gt;Stoop, Norma McLain. "Inside ''The Bell Jar''—Marilyn Hassett:The Upbeat Side of a Tragic Type". ''After Dark'', Danad Publishing Company, Inc., New York, 98 pp. May 1979, pp. 74–76&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues regularly contained features on fashion; at times articles were about men's fashion exclusively. The "Cityscapes" section contained brief articles about then-current items of note in various cities or other geographical areas worldwide, for example, London; [[Toronto]]; [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]; [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]; [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]; [[Birmingham, Alabama]]; [[Kansas]]; [[New Jersey]]; Washington, D.C.; and [[Miami, Florida|Miami]].

== Advertising ==
For its advertising space promotion in the February 1977 issue of the magazine, ''After Dark'' touted,
::"Reach the Audience with Money to Spare. You'll find them in ''After Dark''! They're affluent, successful and single. With no strings to tie them down. And the time and money to live it up, any chance they get."&lt;ref name="p97Feb"&gt;''After Dark'', Danad Publishing Company, Inc., New York, 98 pp. February 1977, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

Their profile of their readers stated that 85.2% of their readers were single, were a median age of 33.7, and had a median income of {{US$|20882|1977|round=0}}. They were "upscale", with 75.8% holding managerial or professional positions, well-groomed—76.4% used cologne—and spent {{US$|804|1977|round=0}} a year on clothing. Their readers were "Travel Minded": taking a median 3.5 vacations per year with 56.6% owning valid passports; and "Bon Vivant": 81.6% regularly drinking vodka, 81.3% scotch, 70.3% gin, 63.5% champagne.&lt;ref name="p97Feb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Currency conversion obtained from [http://www.aier.org/ American Institute for Economic Research (AIER)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine contained substantial advertising for gay restaurants, accommodations, nightclubs, bathhouses, guides, books, pornographic movies, and other products. Some of the advertising was not overtly gay; however, much of the advertising was for establishments or products that were well-known to gay men, or contained symbols often used to identify gay-oriented material, such as the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter ''[[lambda]]''. There was also an abundance of advertising for men's boutiques and clothing companies, especially those—such as [[International Male]], for example—that offered skimpy men's underwear or swimwear.

Advertising for other products or services for [[gay]] men was explicit; for example, the ads for [[Hand in Hand Video]], a gay pornography studio; ''[[The David Kopay Story]]'', regarding former professional [[American football|football]] player [[David Kopay]]'s homosexuality;&lt;ref&gt;''After Dark'', Danad Publishing Company, Inc., New York, 98 pp. February 1977, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; and an ad for books by noted gay author [[Paul Monette]], ''The Gold Diggers'' (containing the tag line, "Glittering, Glamorous, Gay"), and ''Lovers: The Story of Two Men'', by Michael Denneny, described in the ad as "A poignantly true love story, with photographs".&lt;ref&gt;''After Dark'', Danad Publishing Company, Inc., New York, 98 pp. May 1979, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The May 1979 issue included an ad for an organization simply identified as "GSF" titled, "No Man Should Be Without A Man!", which stated, "If you would like to meet warm, sincere gay men (and women) who are interesting in forming...relationships then it's time you find out about GSF."&lt;ref&gt;''After Dark'', Danad Publishing Company, Inc., New York, 98 pp. May 1979, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue also included an ad in its "After Dark Classified" ads for a "Gay Astrologer".&lt;ref&gt;''After Dark'', Danad Publishing Company, Inc., New York, 98 pp. May 1979, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other advertising was obviously intended for adult readers as well, presumably those with open minds. The February 1977 issue contained a half-page ad for the [[Harry Reems]] Legal Defense Fund. The ad appealed for funds for Reems' defense in two separate lawsuits for his participation in the pornographic films ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;''After Dark'', Danad Publishing Company, Inc., New York, 98 pp. February 1977, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gay interest ==

Daniel Harris describes the founding of ''After Dark'' as

::One of the strangest reincarnations in journalistic history. Catering to musically inclined blue-haired old ladies and golfers in Hush Puppies, ''Ballroom Dance Magazine'' was a recreational journal for the geriatric set. It was out of the ashes of a periodical devoted to such topics as waltzes, rumbas, and turkey trots that ''After Dark'', an audacious mass-market experiment in gay eroticism, arose like a phoenix in all of its subversive splendor.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Harris, ''The Rise and Fall of Gay Culture'' (NY: Hyperion, 1997), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not described as a "gay magazine", ''After Dark'' regularly covered topics of interest to the gay community. Cal Culver, better known as the gay porn star [[Casey Donovan (porn star)|Casey Donovan]], appeared on the cover of the December 1972 issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativevisionsbooks.com/itmagafter1272.html Cal Culver] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210215343/http://www.creativevisionsbooks.com/itmagafter1272.html |date=February 10, 2007 }} cover image at retail site&lt;/ref&gt; The February 1975 issue included a photographic portfolio of the gay porn star [[Peter Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Dennis (text and photos), "Creating Peter Berlin", ''After Dark'', Danad Publishing Company, Inc., New York, February 1975, pp. 44–51.&lt;/ref&gt; At its height, the magazine had more than 300,000 readers, "composed almost exclusively of gay men," according to Daniel Harris.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise and Fall of Gay Culture'', p. 65. Harris devotes several pages to the trajectory of the magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

The May 1979 issue included a feature article on the [[Peppermint Lounge#G.G.Barnum's Room|G.G. Barnum's Room]], a New York City alternative [[nightclub]] catering to a gay and [[transvestite]] clientele. The feature article included information about the evolution / genesis of the club and the makeup of its then-current customers. The feature also contained a tandem piece on rollerskating disco, "Boogie on Wheels".&lt;ref&gt;Pacheco, Patrick, "Raucous and Roller Disco: More than Dancing / Boogie on Wheels", ''After Dark'', Danad Publishing Company, Inc., New York, 98 pp. May 1979, p. 54–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine publishers acknowledged the magazine's appeal to the gay community, noting that the magazine "had gotten a following in the homosexual community seven or eight years before any of the current homosexual magazines came on the market."&lt;ref name="NYT After Dark"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/01/business/advertising-after-dark-returning-with-mid-august-issue.html|title=Advertising; After Dark Returning With Mid-August Issue|work=The New York Times | date=1982-07-02 | author=Philip H. Dougherty | accessdate=2007-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Embinder, a former advertising salesman for ''After Dark'', went on to found ''[[Blueboy (magazine)|Blueboy]]'', an upscale adult magazine which has been called the gay answer to such straight titles as ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rutledge |first=Leigh W. |date= |title=The Gay Decades: From Stonewall To The Present |publisher=Plume |page=81 |isbn=0-452-26810-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Erotic content ==
The magazine, intentionally or not, provided a level of [[homoeroticism]] by regularly using images of nude or partially nude men for its cover and article illustrations. Although some illustrations of partially clad or nude women were included at times, males comprised the majority of the subjects. Some of the illustrations related directly to the subject of the article, but others seemed to be used just for their nudity or partial nudity.

A feature article in the February 1977 issue, "Musclebound for Glory", contained photos of bodybuilders, thus relating the illustrations directly to the topic of the article. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was the cover model for that issue and several photographs of him were used as illustrations in the article. In two photographs, he appears in the nude; one photograph shows part of his [[penis]]. The feature is an in-depth look at bodybuilding as "one of the most fascinating (and least explored) subcultures in America."&lt;ref&gt;Pacheco, Patrick, "Musclebound for Glory", ''After Dark'', Danad Publishing Company, Inc., New York, 98 pp. February 1977, p. 34–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrated with pictures of barely clothed bodybuilders, the article, intentionally or not, evokes homoeroticism.

One photograph in that issue that seems to use gratuitous nudity is one of actor [[Paul Charles (actor)|Paul Charles]], performing the role of "Mark" on  [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]''. The illustration is one of several for an article about current events on Broadway, and consists of a narrative text as well as photographs of performers with brief summaries of their productions in the captions of the photos.&lt;ref&gt;Mewborn, Brant, "What's in the News: Broadway Buzz", ''After Dark'', Danad Publishing Company, Inc., New York, 98 pp. February 1977, p. 8–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles is photographed nude with a fur coat strategically draped over one shoulder that just covers his [[groin]].

'''Beijing World Park''' ({{zh|s=北京世界公园|t=北京世界公園|p=Běijīng Shìjiè Gōngyuán}}) is a [[theme park]] that attempts to give visitors the chance to see the world without having to leave [[Beijing]]. The park covers 46.7 [[hectares]] and is located in the southwestern [[Fengtai District]] of [[Beijing]]. It is about 17&amp;nbsp;km from [[Tiananmen]], the City center, and 40&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Beijing Capital International Airport|Capital International Airport]]. The park opened in 1993 and is estimated to receive 1.5 million visitors annually.&lt;ref name="china.org.cn"&gt;http://www.china.org.cn/english/travel/126712.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:世界公园4.JPG|thumbnail]]
==The park==
The entrance to the park is made up of a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] castle, Roman corridor, and granite relief sculptures. Immediately inside the gate is an Italian-style terrace garden with grand staircases, fountains, and sculptures inspired by originals from the [[European Renaissance]]. More lawns and gardens are scattered throughout the park. On these lawns are miniature models of around 100 of the world’s most famous statues including the American [[Statue of Liberty]], Copenhagen’s [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|Little Mermaid]], [[David (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo’s David]], and the [[Venus de Milo]].&lt;ref name="china.org.cn" /&gt; Once inside the gates, Beijing World Park consists of two main parts: the scenic portion and the shopping, dining, and entertainment area.

===Scenic area===
The scenic area of the park models itself after the naturalistic layout of the globe, representing the four major oceans, and focusing on five continents: Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, and South America. The park contains about a hundred (109) scaled-down replicas of famous landmarks from nearly 40 countries and regions around the world, including the [[Tower Bridge]] in London, the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris, and the [[Giza Necropolis|Great Pyramids in Egypt]]. There is even a miniature [[Manhattan]], complete with twin towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]]. Each landmark represents its country or region of origin and is situated in the park according to its location on the map.

Close attention to detail was paid in modeling these landmarks after their originals. For example, detailed carvings and ornamentations are included. Even the materials used are modeled after their originals to create the most authentic look possible. For example, the replica of the [[Great Pyramids]] was constructed of 200,000 white marble bricks, each as large as a bar of soap. [[Red Square]] in Russia, is replicated by paving the smaller model in World Park with over 5 million red bricks smaller than [[mahjong tiles]].&lt;ref name="en.beijing2008.cn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/spectators/beijing/tourism/list/n214068433.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012084519/http://en.beijing2008.cn/spectators/beijing/tourism/list/n214068433.shtml |archivedate=2008-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===List of Some International Landmarks Featured in Beijing World Park===
*[[Egyptian pyramids|Egypt’s Great Pyramids]]
*[[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Egypt’s Pharos of Alexandria]]
*[[Great Sphinx of Giza|Egypt’s Great Sphinx]]
*[[Eiffel Tower|France’s Eiffel Tower]]
*[[Arc de Triomphe|France’s Arc de Triomphe]]

*[[Tower Bridge|The United Kingdom’s Tower Bridge]]
*[[New York City|The United States’ Manhattan with Empire State Building and World Trade Center]]
*[[New York City|The Statue of Liberty]]

Many of the locale-specific areas focused on the five continents also include live entertainment or some kind of an immersive cultural experience such as a dance performance or parade based on customs from their culture of origin.  There is a special garden area in the scenic portion of the park that consists of China's Qingyingjing Park, Japan's [[Katsura Imperial Villa]], and an American-style garden villa. This allows visitors to see global styles of gardening.&lt;ref name="en.beijing2008.cn" /&gt; To get around the park, visitors can travel the four “oceans” by speedboat tour. They can also take a monorail that circumvents the five continents to give tourists a glimpse of the whole “world”. Or they can take a tour of the park in battery-operated cars.

===Shopping, dining, and entertainment area===
The other portion of the park includes the shopping and dining area. This area is modeled after Euro-American architecture. The various establishments allow visitors to purchase souvenirs and sample cuisine from the countries and regions represented in the scenic portion of the park. This second part of the park also includes the entertainment area where grand spectacles and cinema features take place in large theatres to showcase global cultural costume, movement, and customs. Some of these cultural activities include the daily opening ceremonies, which consist of a parade of large-scale floats. There are also culture-specific folklore dances that take place indoors or in open-air arenas. These dances may be performed by Beijing World Park dancers, or they may be performed by troupes representing their local cultures. In 2005 the Park even hosted a Thai elephant that performed four times a day from May to October.&lt;ref name="china.org.cn" /&gt;

==The 2008 Summer Olympics==
During the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], it was selected as one of the three [[Free speech zone|protest zones]].

==''The World''==
''[[The World (film)|The World]]'' is a 2004 film directed by [[Jia Zhangke]], which was made at Beijing World Park and focused on the lives of some fictional park employees.

==Nearby attractions==
The [[Beijing Dabaotai Western Han Dynasty Mausoleum]] is located {{convert|0.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast from the south entrance of the World Park.  The mausoleum hosts the 2,000-year-old tombs of a [[Western Han dynasty]] prince and his wife.

The '''Carbuncle Cup''' is an architecture prize, given annually by the magazine ''[[Building Design]]'' to "the ugliest building in the United Kingdom completed in the last 12 months".&lt;ref name=bd2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/six-in-race-for-carbuncle-cup/5003099.article |title=Six in race for Carbuncle Cup |date=22 July 2010 |author=Watson, Anna |publisher=bdonline.co.uk |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to be a humorous response to the prestigious [[Stirling Prize]],&lt;ref name=bd2008 /&gt; given by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAStirlingPrize/RIBAStirlingPrize.aspx |title=RIBA Stirling Prize |publisher=RIBA |accessdate=2010-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930145808/http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAStirlingPrize/RIBAStirlingPrize.aspx |archivedate=30 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cup was launched in 2006, with the first winner being [[Drake Circus Shopping Centre]] in [[Plymouth]] by [[Chapman Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article1290884.ece |title=The malling of our cities |work=The Times |date=10 January 2007 |author=Dyckhoff, Tom |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shortlist is announced by the periodical each year, based on nominations from the public, and usually in the same week as the Stirling Prize shortlist. Free voting via the magazine's website was at first used to select the winner. Since 2009 a small group of critics has selected the winner.

The award was inspired by the [[Carbuncle Awards]] of Scottish architecture magazine ''[[Urban Realm]]'', formerly ''Prospect'', had been presenting to buildings and areas in Scotland since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanrealm.com/carbuncles/2005/The_Carbuncle_Awards_2005.html |title=The Carbuncle Awards 2005 |author= Urban Realm |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The names derive from a comment by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], an opponent of certain modernist styles and forms and a staunch defender of existing characterisations, themes and points of interest, who in 1984 described [[Ahrends, Burton and Koralek]]'s proposed extension of London's [[National Gallery]] as a "monstrous [[carbuncle]] on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/may/17/architecture.regeneration|title=Life after carbuncles|first=Jonathan|last=Glancey|date=17 May 2004|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html|title=A speech by HRH The Prince of Wales at the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), Royal Gala Evening at Hampton Court Palace|accessdate=2007-06-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213205/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former theater manager Farouk Masri told journalists that his family had decided that the political situation had calmed sufficiently to make  building a modern movie house profitable in a city that had lacked one for many years.  "It's been missing from Nablus, the cinema houses, been missing since the [[First Intifada|first intifada]], over 20&amp;nbsp;years."  He said that the new cinema was, "The talk of the street, I keep hearing&amp;nbsp;... Everybody is just excited, they're very positive about it, and they're very supportive".&lt;ref name=Kenyon/&gt;  Among the excited children in the audience were many who had never seen a movie shown in  real theater, only on the small screens of televisions and video players.&lt;ref name=Kenyon/&gt;

The Palestinian hailed the new cinema as "awe inspiring" but accused the international press of being "there-for-the-moment reporters" who seem  "to have come down with a case of 'occupation isn't so bad' syndrome" as they focus on "the new thrills of the Nablus cinema" rather than on  "the people's actual grievances".&lt;ref name=Aizenstat&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=234644 "From Kalashnikovs to knafa,"] Jesse Aizenstat, 27/10/2009, Ma'an News Agency.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Example movie end credits.png|thumb|right|Example of closing credits]]
'''Closing credits''' or '''end credits''' are a list of the [[Cast member|cast]] and [[Film crew|crew]] of a particular [[Film|motion picture]], [[television program]], or [[video game]]. Where [[opening credits]] appear at the beginning of a work, closing credits appear close to, or at the very end of a work. A full set of credits can include the cast and crew, but also production sponsors, distribution companies, works of music licensed or written for the work, various legal disclaimers, such as [[copyright]] and more. Some long-running productions list "[[production babies]]".

Typically, the closing credits are typed and appear in white lettering on a solid black background, featuring no sound effects or dialogue, only a musical background, sometimes the works' [[theme music]]. Credits are either static and flip from page to page, or scroll as a single list from the bottom of the screen to the top. Occasionally closing credits will divert from this standard form to scroll in another direction, include [[illustrations]], extra scenes, [[bloopers]], joke credits, or [[post-credits scene]]s.

==History==
The use of closing credits in film to list complete production crew and cast was not firmly established in American film until the 1970s. Before this decade, most movies were released with no closing credits at all&lt;!-- I disagree I was a Film Projectionist from 1944 to 1950 and can say that all the 'A' films had full closing credits always with the films music, it was stated at the time this was done not just to give credit to the actors, crew and sometimes suppliers but also to continue the feeling (and magic)of the film as the Audience left the theatre, after all to most people at that time the film they had just seen was probably the only entertainment they would have had for a week or two. --&gt;. Films generally had [[opening credits]] only, which consisted of just major cast and crew, although sometimes the names of the cast and the characters they played would be shown at the end, as in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'' and the 1964 ''[[Fail-Safe (1964 film)|Fail Safe]]''. Two of the first major films to contain extensive closing credits – but almost no opening credits – were the [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]s ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956) and ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' (1961). ''West Side Story'' showed only the title at the beginning of the film, and ''Around the World in 80 Days'' had no opening credits at all.

''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' had one of the longest and most elaborate closing credit sequences of any film. The credits took around seven minutes to finish. It provided an animated recap of the movie's three-hour storyline, identifying the actors in the order in which they appeared. ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) also had a very long closing credits sequence, which took nearly eight minutes to end, and was the longest end credits sequence ever recorded at the time of the film's release.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman''-DVD commentary by Ilya Salkind, Warner Home Video, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some [[live action/animated film]]s' end credits later ran from seven to eight minutes in length, such as ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988) ''[[Space Jam]]'' (1996), ''[[Scooby-Doo (2002 film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' (2014). 
The 2016 movie ''[[Assassin's Creed (film)|Assassin's Creed]]'' end credits extends for almost 15 minutes.

The British television series ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'' does not feature any credits, as a result of a decision made by the producers to add to the anonymity of the show's content (about the British Security Service). Instead, the credits appear as a special feature on the series DVDs, and also on the official website. Similarly, the British series ''[[Jam (TV series)|Jam]]'' (2000) features a single title at the end of each episode reading only "jamcredits.com".

==Humorous credits==
Some closing credits include [[out-take]]s. Sometimes a parting scene is edited in after the credits conclude as a final joke. For example, in ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', Ferris appears and breaks [[the fourth wall]] to say "You're still here? ... It's over! Go home!" The [[Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker]] films have included spoof production members, credits unrelated to the movie ("Author of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' – [[Charles Dickens]]"), cooking recipes and song lyrics in their closing credits, while [[Monty Python]] films have included credits for ridiculous and non-existent production staff. On some occasions, the filmmakers will have a character come back and pop in during the credits to see the goings-on (a noted example is ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', in which several characters interact with the credits as if they were physical objects). In certain special episodes of the motoring show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', the credits are comedically altered in ways appropriate to the episode: for example, in the American special, the first names of all the cast and crew were listed as "Billy Bob". The ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]" featured altered credits after the episode, critical of [[Scientology]], ends with [[Stan Marsh]] yelling "Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!" The credits then list every member of every position as either "[[John Doe|John]]" or "Jane Smith". Another noteworthy example is [[Daffy Duck]] appearing in the credits of ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]'' complaining about how long they run. On other occasions [[post-credits scene|additional scenes]] to advance the storyline (such as in ''[[Wild Things (film)|Wild Things]]'' and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''), influence or guide the viewers to a possible outcome of the film's conclusion (such as in ''[[WALL-E]]'' or [[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]) or set up sequels (such as in ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' and ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'') may occur after the credits roll. In the case of ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'', additional scenes are included that serve all three purposes, including ones in the style of the whimsically narrated "previews" from the television series that the films were based on. The closing credits for the extended edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' have sketches of the characters and the actors who portrayed them.

Sometimes the closing credits of comedic films include footage of [[blooper]]s that occurred during production. Most [[Jackie Chan]] movies include these. The practice was parodied in the [[Pixar]] films ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', and ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' which feature specially-animated bloopers that portray the films' animated characters as actors who make mistakes.

On [[Father's Day]], ''[[Big Brother UK]]'' credits everyone using their father's name. For example, Steve Jones would be billed as "Adam Jones' son". The 2006 film ''[[Clerks 2]]'' by [[Kevin Smith]] features an extended closing credits that included a list of anyone who joined Smith's "friends network" on [[MySpace.com|MySpace]] in the months building up to the film's release. The very long list of credits (in multi-column format) has forced some theaters to either stop the projector early or to cut out sections of the film reel so that the theater could be cleaned in time for the following showing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Upon the film's release, Smith announced that he would continue the MySpace friends credit list through 2006 and would include any new names on the DVD credits when the film is released on DVD, which he did. On the 1969–1974 version of ''[[Beat the Clock]]'', the closing credits were known as a "boss list": the executive producer, for example, was the "Super Boss", the producer, "Boss", the stunt coordinator "Stunt Boss" and the host's assistant "Pretty Girl Boss".

==Marginalization for television promotion==

[[File:Priceisrightmarginalizedcredits.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An example of marginalized credits from ''[[The Price is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]].'']]

On American television, the time the viewers spent watching the closing credit roll was often considered an opportunity to promote other shows on the network. Typically, this was accomplished by lowering the volume of or muting the closing music while a [[continuity announcer]] on voice-over pitched another program – each continuity announcer would often remind the viewer to "stay tuned" for the following show. Examples included [[Ernie Anderson]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[Alan Kalter]] on [[USA Network]] until 1996, [[Phil Tonken]] on WOR-TV (now [[WWOR-TV]]) in [[New York City]], and various [[Cartoon Network]] voiceovers on Cartoon Network until 2008. To help avoid [[cacophony]] with the theme song, most American television series produced since 1970 had few, if any, vocals in the closing music. As technology advanced, however, networks decided to replace the voice-overs with full-blown visual promos. Before the 1970s, there are many sponsor logos/tags that were featured in their end credits on their original network broadcast runs.

In the U.S., networks now run a split-screened version of the show's credits to allow for running a promo (known in some circles as "generic credits", "split-screen credits", "squeezed credits" or "credit crunch").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Charlie |last=Brooker |authorlink=Charlie Brooker |title=Charlie Brooker's screen burn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguide/columnists/story/0,,2077719,00.html |work=The Guide |publisher=The Guardian |date=2007-05-12 |accessdate=2007-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBC]] started this practice in the fall of 1994 with a strategy called "NBC 2000," which was designed to keep viewers from channel-surfing. All NBC shows used this practice, except for ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', which would switch in 2001. At that time, the credits were displayed on the right side of the screen, using a typeface on all shows that differs from the one used in the actual closing credits of each individual program (hence the common nickname "generic credits"), with "promo-tainment" (vintage scenes, trivia questions, etc.) on the left side or, for shows like ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Mad About You]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]''[[Seinfeld|,]] ''[[Frasier]]'', or ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'' (starting sometime around the third season),  a tag sequence. Shortly after its adoption, the network shifted from "promo-tainment" to just airing promos for other NBC programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-07-27/news/1996209061_1_remote-control-change-the-channel-magic-wand|title=Push-button battle of the sexes Remotes: The remote control, invented 40 years ago, underscores the differences between male and female behavior, and in turn, influences television programming and advertising.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All five major commercial broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[The CW]]) use this format; in mid-2004, Fox was the first major network to shift its credits to the lower one-quarter of the screen, and by the end of that year, ABC and NBC followed suit. In 2005, CBS, [[The WB Television Network|The WB]], [[UPN]] (and, when it launched the following year, [[The CW]]) began shifting credits to the lower quarter of the screen. By the early 2000s, the use of "generic credits" began to spread to [[cable television|cable]]; most channels owned by the [[MTV Networks]] unit of [[Viacom]] (including [[MTV]], [[VH1]], [[Nickelodeon]] and [[Comedy Central]]), [[Lifetime (TV channel)|Lifetime]] and [[Lifetime Movie Network]] (though in June 2011, it was abandoned on their movies and scripted drama series, in favor of showing the original studio credits on the lower half of the screen), [[BBC America]] and (on certain syndicated programs and films) [[ABC Family]] began using this type of format. Since 2009, [[pay television|premium television]] service [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] also uses generic closing credits on its original series, and is the only premium channel to use this format. Some of the aforementioned cable channels, particularly the Nickelodeon channels (except Nick Jr.) and until recently ABC Family have removed tag scenes or blooper reels originally featured during the show's end credits, replacing them with marginalized credits to air promos for other network programming.
[[CBS]] later adapted this practice, replacing tag sequences (for its sitcoms) with promos beginning the January of 1995. When [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] adapted this practice in the fall of 1995, they first use the promo on top and the show's logo with the roll on the bottom, except for sitcoms (barring ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'' and ''[[The Jeff Foxworthy Show]]'', which used split-screen credits), but starting in the fall of 1996, all ABC sitcoms started using the trend. In the case of ''Seinfeld'' on NBC, they used the West-Shapiro and Castle Rock cards after the credits, as opposite to other NBC shows, which used the studio logo cards before the credits.

On some shows, the credits are reduced to either a rapid-fire crawl, or quick-flashing cards; in some cases, each credit would appear on-screen for less than one second (a prime example is at the end of each episode of ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'', in which there is a rapid credit-crawl to fit in all of the contestant's closing speech). Sometimes a promo would run shorter of the normal time it would take to run the credits at normal speed. Thus, the credits even "sped-up" near the end in order to show all the credits before the promo ended (a prime example of this is NBC's showing of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', in which there were so many credits to be shown in so little time that credits switched almost every frame, making it impossible for anyone to read, even with a slow motion capability – and ''[[The Biggest Loser (U.S. TV series)|The Biggest Loser]]'', particularly during the season finale episodes). Starting with the 2004 season, ABC air their closing credits of its sitcoms at the bottom of the screen, during the closing scene in a format that keeps in-line with the network's generic credits look. These credits, however, air without the dark-colored bar that airs during their other prime-time programs, except for promotional consideration tags that appear near the end of the credits. In other words, the credits are superimposed over the closing scene's action in the same manner as the original studio credits.

Most daytime [[soap opera]]s used closing credits for many years. Most of the shows aired during the week (e.g., Monday through Thursday) would list just the main people involved with the production and a few of the principal actors and actresses. However, given the large number of people involved with the production of each serial, a full cast and crew credit crawl could last three minutes or longer. Because of this, an expanded credit roll would often air at least once a week, such as on the Friday show,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} with the closing theme often an expanded version of the show's opening music. Starting in 1999, soap operas began eliminating the full-screen crawl in favor of the one-third screen credits/promo combination. While NBC, ABC and CBS soaps all use the upper portion of the screen to show advertisements for primetime programming, ABC soaps showed previews for the next episode until 2008 and intermittently since then (the network's lone remaining soap, ''[[General Hospital]]'', currently runs an episode preview during the end credits). In comparison, daytime soaps rerun on [[SOAPnet]] until the channel shut down in 2013 continued to use full-screen credits. Around Christmas time, ABC soaps formerly aired holiday-themed credits, which do not feature network promotions; ''[[One Life to Live]]'', in particular, scrolled the credits over a shot of a lighted [[Christmas tree]] (this practice ended around 2011). CBS soaps also air holiday-themed credits that also do not feature network promotions; most of their airings are "classic" airings from previous years, and the credits usually include a fully decorated Christmas tree, a fire burning in the fireplace in the background, etc., complete with random Christmas music and ending with the cast breaking the [[fourth wall]] with a holiday greeting (since the late 2000s, the latter element has been typically played as a separate epilogue before the credit sequence, while all of the other mentioned elements have been dropped).

Daytime [[game show]]s worked in much the same vein as soap operas. A shorter version might list one or two people involved with the production, along with such plugs as for prizes and wardrobe providers. At least once a week, a full-length credit roll would air over the extended main theme (along with camera shots of such things as the contestant talking with the host and/or celebrities). By the mid-1990s, ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' was the lone daytime game show remaining, and it would eventually switch to marginalized credits, starting in the fall of 1999. Game shows that have the full closing credits that do not scroll up include ''[[Go (TV series)|Go]]'', ''[[The New $25,000 Pyramid]]'', both the [[Dick Clark]] and [[John Davidson (actor)|John Davidson]] versions of ''The $100,000 Pyramid'', the original versions of ''[[Beat the Clock]]'', ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', ''[[Password (TV series)|Password]]'', ''[[What's My Line?]]'', the [[Bill Cullen]] version of ''The Price is Right'' and the original [[Mike Adamle]] version of ''[[American Gladiators]]'' from the second half of the first season to the end of the series run. The original ''[[Match Game]]'' had the credits scrolling up at the bottom of the screen; the 1970s version of ''Match Game'' had the credits scrolling up bottom-to-top during ''Match Game '73'' and right-to-left starting with ''Match Game '74'' and including ''Match Game PM'' and the syndicated version from 1979 to 1982. Goodson-Todman's ''[[Double Dare (1976 game show)|Double Dare]]'' placed the credits on the main game board to show off the then state-of-the-art electronic display board. Sometimes on that show, the camera zoomed into the game board before the credits began. On the original daytime ''Wheel of Fortune'' in the 1970s and 1980s as well as the first few seasons of the nighttime Wheel, the credits always began with a list of sponsors over a shot of the Wheel.

Some cable channels have used credits to blur the lines between the end of one show and the beginning of the following program. [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] had formerly run the program's end credits in small (sometimes illegible) type at the bottom of the screen while another episode of the same program began at about three-quarters height. Similarly on networks like [[E!]] and formerly [[Esquire Network|Style Network]], the program-to-program transition is seamless; to do this, the networks have moved the closing credits for their programs to air within the first minute of a show, usually on the bottom 1/3 of the screen in small, translucent type. For E!, the closing credits for the program being seen at that moment is seen at the start of that program; for other networks that use this practice, whether they use a [[double-box]] or generic credit format, the closing credits for the preceding program is seen during the opening of the next program. A few networks such as [[Nick at Nite]], Comedy Central, [[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]] and [[TV Land]] have even moved the production company cards (displayed in a small box) in their network-generated credits (in the case of Nick at Nite from 2010 to 2011, this was done only when the generic closing credits are shown at the beginning of an episode of a show during back-to-back airings of most series, while a promo/generic credit combo followed by the production company credits are shown at the end of the last episode of a show's back-to-back block; this is now the common parlance since 2012 as the credits are now superimposed over the final scene of the episode for certain programs).

Often, the network-to-local transition between the end of the network [[primetime]] schedule and late local news on broadcast networks will feature the network show credits on the bottom of the screen, while the local news [[Cold open|teaser]] sequence, [[station identification]], news opening, and then the top story will take place. Once the credits end, the local news broadcast zooms in to fill the screen, creating a seamless hand-off.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Despite some objections by television production unions, some programs, such as those that air on [[Discovery Communications|Discovery Networks]] and the U.S. version of the [[National Geographic Channel]] only air the credits during a program's premiere broadcast, referring viewers to a website to view the credits in subsequent broadcasts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Some networks, such as [[Game Show Network|GSN]], have even begun cutting off the credits before they finish, most likely to allow more time for [[Television commercial|commercials]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} though GSN has begun to squeeze the production company closing credits to the bottom third of the screen and show the entire credits during that time; [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]] (only on its original programming and certain syndicated shows), [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] and [[Hallmark Channel]] also squeeze the production company credits to the lower third of the screen. Some cable channels mix use of generic and the actual production company credits depending on the show, ABC Family currently airs generic credits on most [[broadcast syndication|acquired programs]] where most episodes have no tag scene, while acquired programs where most episodes do feature one, the tag scene and/or production company credits are aired full-screen, and since June 2010, the channel's original series have the closing credits overlaid on the final scene of the episode (though these were separated in airings of their original programs via its website and [[video on demand|VOD]] service until 2012).

Until CBS opted not to continue maintaining rights to the [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]] series in 2011, the original credits were aired; the ending promo would be shown first, then the original closing credits. When the Hallmark Hall of Fame moved to ABC in 2011 starting with the telecast of ''[[Have a Little Faith (film)|Have a Little Faith]]'', with the advent of ABC using generic credits on some television specials, the network began using marginalized closing credits being played concurrently with the ending promo; as a result, original closing credits are no longer seen on original airings, and must be first seen on the DVD release or the [[Hallmark Channel]] rebroadcast.

Also, [[UPN]] used the announcer overlapping studio's logo music and sounds over that logos before split-screen credits of UPN programming, except some programs which carried vanilla studio logos without voiceover.

[[The WB Television Network]] used the studio's logo music and sounds with no voiceover up until 2004. [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] did the same thing also up until at least 2001, with programming from [[20th Century Fox Television]] using the studio's well-known opening [[drumroll]] over the Fox logo from 1997 to 2001. [[American Broadcasting Company]] did the same until 1998 when they adapted the iconic 4-note jingle.

[[Steven Bochco]]'s shows aired on their major networks featured Steven Bochco's own logo theme instead of generic music theme. The same can't be said for if a show is made by either [[David E. Kelley]] or [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], but at least Kelley used the "You stinkah!" logo card and its own music at all on split-screen credits of Kelley productions.

===Notable exceptions in regard to television productions===
Full closing credits are still created by the production company and are used in syndicated reruns of a program, and are always seen if the program is released as a [[DVD]] box set, is broadcast via [[video on demand]] or is streamed online via the network's website or websites such as [[Hulu]] or [[Netflix]] that specialize in airing television programs. For the latter, newer versions of each streaming provider's interfaces may encourage the continuous [[binge-watching]] of series, thus the credits (which are often extended with foreign [[dub localization]]s and subtitle providers also being acknowledged) are shrunk down to a smaller window locally, presenting the choice to watch credits in full, or go on to the next episode of a series or a new recommended film.

Many animated shows still maintain and air the full version of the credits.

From 1989 to 1994, [[CBS]] and from 1993 to 1996, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] displayed the show's closing credits produced by the production company in a two-panel format, with the actual production credits [[chroma key|chroma-keyed]] to shove to one side of the screen with a video promo for other network programming on the other side (CBS displayed the show's closing credits at the left and promo on the right of the screen in a two-panel format, while ABC displayed them in the reverse order with the promo taking up only one-quarter of the screen); since the late 2000s, there has been a trend of cable channels using this credit display format, usually shown in a vertical or (usually) horizontal [[double-box]] format similar to that used in television news to toss to and from field reports. [[Ion Television]] is the only commercial broadcast network using a double-box format; all others using this format are cable networks including [[Disney XD]], [[Syfy]], [[USA Network]], [[WGN America]], most of the [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner]] networks, such as [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and at times [[Cartoon Network]] (Cartoon Network uses generic credits on some programs), during syndicated programming only on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] and [[TruTV]], and occasionally Viacom-owned [[Paramount Network]] (Paramount Network uses generic credits that are superimposed over the last scene of most programs and movies). In some cases, the show credits return to full-screen in time for the production company logos at the end of the credit sequence; though a few channels such as TNT and Cartoon Network do not shrink or expand the original closing credits from full-screen and back at any point during the credit sequence and a promo is shown along with the production company credits throughout.

Spanish-language networks typically do not use generic credits or marginalize the credits for network promotion; however, during movies aired in prime time, [[Telemundo]] and [[UniMás]] do air promos while the closing credits as produced by the film's production company are scrolling, usually shown in the speed scroll commonly used for basic cable or broadcast syndication runs of films due to time constraints. Similar to the aforementioned program-to-program hand-off during the credits, TBS and TNT, as well as some [[A&amp;E (TV network)|A&amp;E]] programs, presently show one program's original production credits, in a double-box style side-by-side with the next program's cold open; TBS does this only from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. and TNT from 6 a.m. to midnight [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], and a promo may be shown if the next program's episode starts with the opening credits immediately followed by a commercial break and the double-box credit format is done with movies airing outside of late night).

[[Chiller (TV network)|Chiller]], [[Adult Swim]], [[Up (TV channel)|Up]], [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]], [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]] (excluding [[Primetime]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boomerang USA: "NEW" D.O.G. and ECP #1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CBXUWWNu0M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Viacom-owned [[Nick Jr.]] and [[Tr3́s]] do show the original program credits full-screen; TV One in particular often uses voice-overs to promote other programs. TeenNick (dating back to its existence as The N) also showed the closing credits full-screen on most shows that have a tag scene, though those that did not have a tag and a small few that did used the double-box format, though since July 2010, a generic credit sequence has been used on most programs, causing the elimination of tag scenes on a few programs.

Since 2006, [[Disney Channel]] runs tag scenes during the closing credits on all of its original scripted programs including preschool and animated series; the channel also overlays the credits over the final scene in special airings of Disney XD's original live-action series, which are normally kept separate when aired on Disney XD; since the 2009 original movie ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie]]'', the channel's original made-for-cable films also feature outtakes during the closing credits. Premium channels Showtime and [[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]], as well as most basic cable channels, such as [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] and [[FX (TV channel)|FX]], have also squeezed down the standard production credits of some or all of their movies to the bottom half of the screen (usually starting about 15–25 seconds into the credits and ending anywhere from 30 seconds to three minutes before the end of the credits) with the film credits running at normal speed in order to show behind-the-scenes features or network promos; [[HBO]], [[Cinemax]], [[Encore (TV channel)|Encore]] (since September 2009), [[Epix (TV channel)|Epix]] and [[The Movie Channel]] do not do this with any of their films. Starz and Encore are the only premium channels that promote original series and upcoming films with an info box that appears during the ending credits on their programming.

''[[American Idol]]'', ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'', ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'', and ''[[The X Factor (U.S.)|The X Factor]]'' are also exceptions, showing the full credits in a rapid-fire card format as the shows close (along with voting disclaimers).

Between 1995 and 1996, and again from 2008 and 2009, both ABC and Fox aired their sitcoms' closing credits in the shows' respective credit fonts, instead of the network generic font (excepting ABC's telecasts of ''Coach'' and ''The Jeff Foxworthy Show''). Fox's airings of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' also currently air full-screen (from 1996 to 2008, the network usually aired the voice credits for the actors and special guest voices full-screen before switching to generic credits for the rest of the roll).

In the United Kingdom all channels have their own variations in which way closing credits are presented. The five main networks rarely promote other shows and show the full original credits supplied with the show. In the early 2000s ITV adopted a practice similar to that of NBC 2000, generic credits to the right hand side of the screen with a promo running on the left. This then changed in 2007 when generic credits where flashed in a letterbox format using 1/4 of the lower half of the screen whilst promos ran across the top. Again similar to NBC. When the channel revamped years later they dropped this and have now gone back to a more 'old fashioned' presentation. Only some specific cable and satellite channels use a more American style credits/promo presentation but this varies greatly even on the same channel. This leads to viewers switching channels as the networks waste time airing full closing credits with no incentive to stay tuned. Some networks like the [[BBC]] also use a double-box format for the closing credits; the BBC has even laid out guidelines as to how the credits must be shown on its networks;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/tv/production/credit-guidelines/end-credits.shtml ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; closing credits must be shown at the center of the screen and be either separate cards or scroll vertically (percentage reduction testing in an editing suite is required in post-production to ensure readability), the BBC networks and other unrelated broadcast, cable and satellite channels in the United Kingdom such as [[Nickelodeon (UK &amp; Ireland)|Nickelodeon UK]] will squeeze and reduce the credits to 60% of their original size and crop them, returning them to full screen in time for the production company credits, in a manner similar to many of the aforementioned American cable channels.In Spain closing credits are never aired on any channel instead going straight to commercial break,straight into the next show or if airing the next episode of the same show there is a seamless transfer to this. Ens credits are also never aired at the end of movies. &lt;!--- The channels listed in this subsection. ---&gt;

==After closing credits==
After the credits, it would just have the closing variant of the movie company which is a still version of it or a silent version or a short version. Sometimes, the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] screen would appear in the end. A black [[FBI Warning]] screen could appear in the end. In [[Universal Studios]] and [[20th Century Fox]] films (up to 2010), and formerly [[New Line Cinema]], Metro Goldwyn Mayer, and [[Lionsgate]] (formerly Artisan), the [[Deluxe Digital Studios]] or DVCC logo or any digital service logo would be shown. Many Universal films produced at Universal Studios in [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Hollywood]] or [[Universal Studios Florida|Orlando]] would have a plug for the studios, inviting moviegoers to visit; in the film ''[[Animal House]]'', this plug included a brief reminder to "ask for Babs", in reference to Delta House foe [[Babs Jansen]], who, after the events in the film, was hired as a tour guide for Universal Studios in Hollywood.

If the credits are part of a television program, after the credits, the production company's and distributor's/channel's logo (and in some cases, their copyright notices and year of production) are played or displayed. Sometimes, there will be a service or trademark symbol at the right side of their logos, parent company byline, an animation of displaying the logo on some logos, FX/SFX which is an additional element/s that appears over the logo, and the music will play when these logos appear.

On all [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] animated movies starting with ''[[Finding Dory]]'', its logo plays at its fullest with the Disney fanfare after the credits.

==Photo Montage==
After the movie ends, it shows photos of the events during the aftermath of films like, ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch]]'', ''[[Rugrats Go Wild]]'', ''[[Cinderella III: A Twist in Time]]'', ''[[Up (2009 film)]]'', ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel]]'', ''[[Rio (2011 film)]]'', ''[[The Smurfs]]'', ''''[[The Croods]]'', ''[[Home (2015 film)]]'', ''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'', ''[[Cars 3]]'', ''[[The Star (2017 film)]]'', ''[[Ferdinand (film)]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3056">'''Dara''' is a two-player [[abstract strategy]] [[board game]] played in several countries of West Africa. In [[Nigeria]] it is played by the [[Lela language|Dakarkari]] people. It is popular in [[Niger]] among the [[Zarma people|Zarma]], who call it '''dili'''. In the [[Hausa language]] (Niger and Nigeria), the game is called '''doki''' which means horse. It is an alignment game related to [[tic-tac-toe]], but far more complex. The game was invented in the 19th century or earlier. The game is also known as '''derrah''' and is very similar to [[Wali (game)|Wali]] and [[:it:Dama Tuareg|Dama Tuareg]].

==Goal==
To form three-in-a-rows, and eliminate enough of your opponent's pieces that he or she can no longer form three-in-a-rows.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Game of dili in Niger 2014.jpg|thumbnail|right|Game of dili in Niger]] --&gt;

==Equipment==
The board is a 5x6 square board. Each player has 12 pieces. One player plays Black and the other plays White, however, any two colors will do. In Niger, people simply dig out 30 holes in the sand; one side takes [[Hyphaene thebaica|doum]] nuts, the other short sticks.

==Game play and rules==
# Players decide among themselves who starts first.
# The board is empty in the beginning. Players take turn placing their stones onto the empty cells of the square board. This is known as '''Phase 1''' of the game or the '''Drop phase'''.
# After all 24 stones have been dropped, '''Phase 2''' or the '''Move phase''' begins. Players will then take turns moving their pieces orthogonally into an adjacent empty cell.
# Players attempt to make a three-in-a-row with their own pieces. The three-in-a-row must be orthogonal and not diagonal. Furthermore, it must be strictly three pieces in a row, and not four or more pieces in a row; four or more pieces formed in-a-row are illegal. If a three-in-a-row is made by a player, he or she can remove one enemy piece from the board which is not part of a three-in-a-row itself.
# If a player can no longer make three-in-a-rows with their remaining pieces (e.g. if the player only has two pieces left), he or she is the loser, and the other player is the winner.

Three-in-a-rows made during the Drop phase do not count. Therefore, a player cannot remove another player's stone during the Drop phase even if one were to make a three-in-a-row. (In Niger, it is not allowed to make a three-in-a-row during the Drop phase.) Moreover, the rule that four or more pieces in a row are illegal to form also applies in the Drop phase.

If a player were to successfully form two three-in-a-rows ''in one move'' during the Move phase, only one enemy piece can be removed.

'''Discovery Networks Deutschland'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c21media.net/resources/detail.asp?area=100&amp;article=50589&lt;/ref&gt; was a branch of [[Discovery Networks Europe]] holding responsibility for overseeing Discovery Networks brands in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[German language|German]]-speaking parts of [[Switzerland]].Discovery Networks Deutschland's key operations are the [[free-to-air]] [[DMAX (TV channel)|DMAX]], [[Discovery Channel Germany|Discovery Channel]], [[Animal Planet Germany|Animal Planet]] and [[Discovery HD]]. Previously, Discovery Networks Deutschland operated [[Discovery Geschichte]] a channel based on historical events.

Like other Discovery channels in Europe. Discovery Networks Deutschland utilize existing productions from Discovery Networks Europe and [[Discovery Communications]].

==Current operations==
In 2007, Discovery Networks Europe decided to localize its networks across Europe. This resulted in the establishment of Discovery Discovery Networks Deutschland, [[Discovery Networks Benelux]], [[Discovery Networks Nordic]], [[Discovery Networks UK|Discovery Networks UK &amp; Ireland]] and [[Discovery Networks Italia]] and Discovery Networks EMEA (which served all other territories).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a42002/discovery-splits-uk-and-emea-operations.html|title=Discovery splits UK and EMEA operations|date=January 24, 2007|publisher=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/multi-platform/news/paxton-steps-down-as-discovery-splits/118496.article|title=Paxton steps down as Discovery splits|date=January 23, 2007|publisher=Broadcast}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, operations in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[France]] and [[Flanders]] are operated by [[Discovery Networks Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="corporate.discovery.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.discovery.com/brands/international/western-europe/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821191859/http://corporate.discovery.com/brands/international/western-europe/ |archivedate=2011-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="corporate.discovery.com"/&gt; All other operations in Europe are operated by Discovery Networks CEEMEA in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corporate.discovery.com/brands/international/ceemea/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819080923/http://corporate.discovery.com/brands/international/ceemea/ |archivedate=2011-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011, Discovery Networks International restructured its operations in Europe. In February 2011, it established two key branches which resulted in the amalgamation of its localized networks in Europe.

'''DMAX''' is a men's lifestyle channel operated by Discovery Networks Deutschland [[free-to-air]] in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. Though the channel is widely available throughout the rest of Europe. It is seen as the only free-to-air mainstream channel with a focus on non-fiction entertainment, unique in German media.

* DMAX is the [[Discovery Communications]] creation from the originally German sourced and owned station '''XXP'''. Discovery purchased XXP on 1 January 2006. DMAX was launched as a [[free-to-air]] channel from 1 September, targeted towards men.
* Its name was invented by Discovery Creative Director James Gilbey who asked design agencies to submit names in an innovative competition. RedBee based in London were the winning agency.
* DMAX focuses on men's hobbies, and its range of programmes is aimed at men looking for more than the current offer of sports and news programmes. DMAX involves a mix of adventure and discovery, cars and technology, popular science, DIY and travel. DMAX does not include [[soccer|football]] or [[pornography|erotic]] programmes.
* Patrick Hörl is Managing Director, while Katja Hofem-Best, who comes from [[RTL II]], is CEO.

== Additional DMAX channels ==
With the success of the German-speaking [[DMAX (UK &amp; Ireland)|DMAX]] a separate channel was launched for the UK and Ireland markets on 22 November 2007.

==Some programmes shown on DMAX==
* '''Was geht? Experiment am Limit''' (What works? Experiments at the limits) - gives solutions for childhood dreams and daily problems. e.g.: can a gun be fired underwater?
* '''Die Ludolfs – vier Brüder auf’m Schrottplatz''' (The Ludolfs – four brothers at the scrapyard) - observes Peter, Manni, Uwe and Günther eating pasta and fiddling around on broken cars
* '''D Tech''' - presenter [[Daniel Hartwich]] takes viewers through the world of knowledge in an entertainment
* '''Fish ’n’ Fun''' - entertains with beautiful landscape shots, reveals fishing tricks and shows men how to make a delicious dish out of their catch. The male desire for adventure is also satisfied, for example with the documentary series on crab fishers in Alaska’s waters
* '''D Motor''' - presented by [[Tim Schrick]] and [[Sabine Schmitz]], who has to prove her own driving skill against an opponent on her local race track, the [[Nürburgring]]
* '''Moneycoach – Rette dein Geld''' (Money coach – save your money) - presenter Michael Requardt helps viewers out of their debt trap

The channel also features many of [[Discovery Communications]] global programs, including:
*'''[[An Idiot Abroad]]'''
* '''[[American Chopper]]'''
* '''[[30 Days (TV series)|30 Days]]''' - with [[Morgan Spurlock]]
* '''[[Monster Garage]]''' - with [[Jesse James (customizer)|Jesse James]]
* '''[[Louis Theroux]]'''
* '''[[Miami Ink]]'''
* '''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ TV]]''' - based on the same format as the popular men's magazine
* '''[[Jack Osbourne: Adrenaline Junkie]]''' - a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Reality television|reality]] series focusing on [[Jack Osbourne]]'s globe-trekking six-month quest to get in physical and mental shape to climb the rockface of California's [[El Capitan]] mountain
* '''[[Long Way Round]]''' - documentary television series of the 19,000&amp;nbsp;mile journey of [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Charley Boorman]] from [[London]] to [[New York City]] on [[motorcycle]]s. They travelled eastwards through [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], flew to [[Alaska]] and continued by road from there to New York.
* '''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''' - drama series starring [[Tom Selleck]] as Thomas Magnum, a successful private investigator.
* [[Infomercial|Teleshopping]] broadcasts when DMAX is off air.

'''Discovery Channel''' is the German version of the [[Discovery Channel]]. It is operated by Discovery Networks Deutschland, which is located in [[Munich]].

It was launched on August 26, 1996 on the [[DF1]] satellite platform. Back then, the channel was a joint-venture between [[Kirch Media]] and [[Discovery Communications]]. After DF1 merged with Premiere World in 1999, it remained on the new [[Premiere (pay television network)|Premiere]] platform.

Kirch Media went bankrupt in 2002 and Discovery Communications subsequently became the sole owner of the channel.

The channel was later joined by sister channel with the launch on [[Animal Planet Germany|Animal Planet]] in 2004, [[Discovery Geschichte]] in 2005 and [[Discovery HD]] in 2006.

Discovery Channel was exclusively available through Premiere until 2009, when a new agreement was entered between Premiere and Discovery. The new contract allows the Discovery Channel to broadcast from other providers from July 1 and means that Animal Planet and Discovery Geschichte would disappear from Premiere.&lt;ref name="Meedia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://meedia.de/nc/details/article/discovery-und-animal-planet-bei-unitymedia_100020541.html|title=Discovery und Animal Planet bei Unitymedia|publisher=Meedia|date=May 26, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vPoRrQus?url=http://meedia.de/nc/details/article/discovery-und-animal-planet-bei-unitymedia_100020541.html|archivedate=January 1, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal Planet==

{{main|Animal Planet Germany}}
'''Animal Planet Germany''' is a television channel broadcasting programmes about animals, nature and wildlife to Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

An agreement to launch the channel exclusively on the [[Sky Deutschland|Premiere]] platform was signed by Discovery Networks Deutschland and Premiere in October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://info.premiere.de/inhalt/de/medienzentrum_news_12_10_2003.jsp|title=Premiere und DISCOVERY CHANNEL starten den neuen Sender ANIMAL PLANET|date=October 12, 2003|publisher=Premiere}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel launched at 9&amp;nbsp;p.m. och March 31, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://info.premiere.de/inhalt/de/medienzentrum_news_23_02_2004.jsp|title=Neuer Sender ANIMAL PLANET ab 31.

On June 30, 2009, the channel will disappear from the Premiere platform and be replaced by its competitor [[Nat Geo Wild]]. This was the result of a new contract between Premiere and Discovery Networks in anticipation of Premiere's relaunch as [[Sky Deutschland]] in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.werbung.discovery.de/d/4083/|title=Discovery Networks Deutschland und Premiere geben Einigung bekannt|date=May 15, 2009|publisher=Discovery Networks Deustchland}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the new contract the channel will be able to launch on other platforms.

'''Ethnic theme parks''' are theme parks based on demonstrating the traditions and cultures of a multitude of ethnic groups. In China, Windows Around the World and [[Happy Valley Beijing]] are two examples of these parks which, due to their unique potpourris of heritages, attract tourists worldwide.  The ethnic theme parks are advertised as a way to glimpse into different areas around the world in one easy visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wired Humanities Projects, University of Oregon|url=http://whp.uoregon.edu/chinatheme/tours/ethnic-tour.html|work=Chinese Theme Parks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The layout allocates a separate “village” to each [[ethnic group]], allowing tourists and other visitors to absorb the individuality they portray.  Heritage and history are simulated through elaborate costumes and roles. Visitors also have an opportunity to participate in some of the cultural practices of various ethnic groups and to engage in a question and answer based discussion.&lt;ref name="globalvillage"&gt;Gordon, Tamara, and Bruce Caron. ''Global Villages: The Globalization of Ethnic Display''. New York: Tourist Gaze Productions, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The precise infrastructure of each park is different, but each aims to provide a display case for as many cultural identities as possible. At ''Windows Around the World'', for example, national heritage is classified into three categories: primitive song and dance, professional modifications, and further creative modifications.&lt;ref name="globalvillage"/&gt;

==Controversy==
A debate over authenticity has been sparked in light of the fact that several employees represent nationalities separate from their own individual heritages. The [[Wa people]], for instance, play the roles of African ethnic groups, while [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] are portrayed by ethnic [[Mongols|Mongolians]].&lt;ref name="globalvillage"/&gt;

Disputes also linger over the degree to which governments and corporations seek to mask and embellish what they wish within the walls of the park. According to Thomas Mullaney, a Stanford University historian, these parks are highly politicized venues which seek to shape the popular view of China as a multiethnic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wong|first=Edward|title=China's Han Flock to Theme Parks Featuring Minorities|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/world/asia/24park.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Forbidden Love''''' (called '''''Honour Lost''''' in the [[United States]]) is a 2003 book 
written by [[Norma Khouri]], purporting to tell a true story about her best friend in [[Jordan]]. The story describes Dalia's love for a [[Christianity|Christian]] soldier Michael, kept secret from her  [[Islam|Muslim]] father due to conflict in religion.  Her father eventually finds out and stabs Dalia to death in a so-called [[honor killing]]. A year after publication, it was discovered that Khouri had fabricated the tale and that the story was fictional.

==Plot summary==
The novel centers on the life of Dalia, a young [[Muslim]] woman living in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]]. When she falls in love with Michael, a young [[Catholic]] [[major]] in the [[British Army]], she is forced to keep the relationship a secret and rely on her friend Norma to act as an [[intermediary]]. Although the lovers are only able to be alone together on a handful of occasions and Dalia's virginity remains intact, her father is so enraged when he hears of the affair from her older brother that he kills her two months after her twenty-sixth birthday.  Khouri claimed that as a result, she had been forced to seek asylum in [[Queensland]], Australia.

==Hoax scandal==
Questions about Khouri's story surfaced almost immediately &lt;ref name=Knox/&gt;, as several readers wrote on message boards that much of the book didn't ring true, and located 73 factual errors (some of them basic), anachronisms, and exaggerations (e.g. claiming that Jordan borders [[Kuwait]], "fanciful" depictions of Amman, incorrect statements about Jordanian law, and banknotes that were not printed at the time the book supposedly took place). 

Khouri also aroused suspicions because she spoke perfect [[American English]] despite claiming to have never lived in the United States.&lt;ref name=StrippedBare&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/23/1090464851887.html|last=Knox|first=Malcolm|authorlink=Malcolm Knox (author)|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2007-05-21|date=2004-07-24|title=The lies stripped bare}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Further, Khouri had promised to donate most of the proceeds to the Jordanian National Association for Women, but had only sent $100,&lt;ref name=Inseparable&gt;{{cite news|last=Knox|first=Malcolm|authorlink=Malcolm Knox (author)|title=We were inseparable, says hoaxer's Chicago flatmate|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/26/1090693899061.html|accessdate=18 June 2011|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while the group was suspicious of her claims from the start, contending that it would have known about such a crime given Jordan's size. 

After conducting an investigation, it wrote to Random House Australia in September 2003, but Random House stood by Khouri.&lt;ref name=StrippedBare/&gt;

In July 2004 — a year after the book's release — ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' literary editor [[Malcolm Knox (author)|Malcolm Knox]] wrote a series of articles which exposed Khouri as a complete fraud: based on an 18-month investigation, he concluded Khouri had fabricated the story and sold it untruthfully as a memoir. 

Khouri had not lived in Jordan since 1973, but had lived in [[Chicago]] for most of her life, and was married with two children. Her family had not heard from her since 2000, when she abruptly left Chicago to write the book. 

Khouri continued to insist she'd told the truth, even when confronted with public records which proved beyond all doubt she had spent most of her life in the United States.&lt;ref name=Knox&gt;{{cite news|last=Knox|first=Malcolm|authorlink=Malcolm Knox (author)|title=Bestseller's lies exposed|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/23/1090464854793.html|accessdate=18 June 2011|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=24 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knox also unearthed evidence that suggested Khouri had left Chicago when legal problems arose with several real-estate transactions.&lt;ref name=Inseparable/&gt;

As a result, Random House pulled the book from the shelves in Australia and the UK indefinitely. Knox and fellow Australian journalist [[Caroline Overington]] won the 2004 [[Walkley Award]] for investigative journalism for the exposé.

==''Forbidden Lie$''==
{{main|Forbidden Lie$}}
In September 2007, a documentary entitled ''Forbidden Lie$'' was released.  Director Anna Broinowski tells the story of how Khouri's book became a best-seller, and then follows Khouri to Jordan.  Since Khouri still insists that the story is true, Broinowski gives her the opportunity to prove that it is fully or at least partly truthful; however, the evidence Broinowski uncovers indicates not only that Khouri's book is fiction (in spite of her father's claim that it was true) but that Khouri had committed a number of scams even before the book.

Izzard claims that he has set an "unofficial comedy world record" by ultimately appearing in 45 countries and all 50 U.S. states over the course of the four-year tour.&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jan/21/eddie-izzard-force-majeure-reloaded-review-palace-theatre-london|title=Eddie Izzard: Force Majeure Reloaded review|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dxblaughs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dxblaughs.ae/whatson.php?artist=eddie-izzard|title=DXBLaughs Launches with Eddie Izzard's Force Majeure|publisher=dxblaughs.ae|accessdate=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter goal was finally accomplished when Izzard performed in Honolulu on 8 March 2017.&lt;ref name="hawaiitheatre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiitheatre.com/events/eddie-izzard-force-majeure-world-tour/|title=Eddie Izzard: Force Majeure World Tour at the Hawaii Theatre Center|publisher=hawaiitheatre.com|accessdate=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2249">'''Gambling Hangover''' was the theme of an [[Australia]]n [[social marketing]] campaign to help young male [[gambler]]s.

==The campaign==
The two-year campaign was created by [[Sydney]] agency The Campaign Palace on behalf of the [[Responsible Gambling Fund]], a part of the [[New South Wales Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing]].

It targeted men aged 18–25 in the "morning after" phase following a gambling binge, when they were most likely to seek help for [[problem gambling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Apap | first =Veronica | coauthors = | title =Campaign to curb Illawarra gambling | work =[[Illawarra Mercury]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =2008-04-07 | url =http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/news/local/news/general/campaign-to-curb-illawarra-gambling/803596.aspx?storypage=2 | accessdate = 2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It identified the three main symptoms of a gambling hangover as "a sick feeling," "anxiety and regrets," and "not liking yourself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Masters | first =Clare | coauthors = | title =New gambling hangover campaign targets problem gamblers | work =[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =2008-05-03 | url =http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23687108-5001021,00.html | accessdate = 2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ads were placed where young men were likely to see them in the morning: in train stations, on buses, on morning radio, and in morning newspapers. Young men were urged to visit gamblinghangover.nsw.gov.au, to [[SMS]] for more information, or to call a [[telephone counseling|helpline]] number if they recognised the gambling hangover symptoms in themselves.

Responses to the helpline and in follow-up research showed the phrase had moved into common usage among young men, and 50 percent of those surveyed were able to recall the campaign.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

"Monarchs" are elected and the nonprofit, 501(c)(3) portion is run by a Board of Directors or Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfducal.org/Themes/BOD/BOD.htm|title=SFDucal.org: Royal Board of Directors|accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco, in turn, inspired similar such organizations to be founded around the country. In 1998, the Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco was joined by a sister Court located in Alameda County, on the opposite side of the San Francisco Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.alamedaducal.net/info.html |title=Alameda Ducal: Who We Are |accessdate=2009-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922222916/http://www.alamedaducal.net/info.html |archivedate=September 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfbaytimes.com/?sec=article&amp;article_id=8682|title=Pollo Hits the Alameda Ducal Coronation |last=Del Mar|first=Pollo|date=2008-07-24|work=[[San Francisco Bay Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third such sovereign Ducal Court exists in London, Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.impcourt.org/icis/chapters/london.html |title=ImperialCourt.org |accessdate=2009-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929025558/http://www.impcourt.org/icis/chapters/london.html |archivedate=2009-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Called "one of the city's unsung gay heroes," in 2006 HL Perry, her work establishing the San Francisco Ducal Council and more were commemorated with a month-long exhibit at the San Francisco Public Library.&lt;ref name="Provenzano"/&gt;

==Structure==

Each individual court chapter (or "realm") is a separate, legally incorporated charitable [[non-profit organization]] that raises funds and awareness for various charities and people in need within its realm.  Each chapter has its own [[board of directors]] and is financially responsible for its own management.  In addition to local non-profit status, many courts in the United States have [[U.S. government|Federal]] [[501(c)]] status.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

== Titles ==

Each court holds an annual "[[coronation]]," which is usually the chapter's largest fundraiser and is attended by both local members and members of other Ducal chapters as well Imperial Courts from across North America.  The evening culminates in the ceremony in which the new monarch or monarchs—the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess—are crowned. In San Francisco, the new monarchs are determined by popular elections held in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfbaytimes.com/index.php?sec=article&amp;article_id=11309|title=Pollo Is Back on the Campaign Trail |last=Del Mar|first=Pollo|date=2009-09-20|work=[[San Francisco Bay Times]]|accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a set number of weeks, the newly elected monarchs must hold an "[[investiture]]," at which time they name the members of their Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ebar.com/arts/art_article.php?sec=outabout&amp;article=98|title=Blast from the Past @LGBT Center|last=Provenzano|first=Jim|date=2006-11-09|work=[[Bay Area Reporter]]|accessdate=2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The titles given to members vary from one chapter to another and are primarily left to the discretion of the reigning monarchs.

Each Court consists of a [[Royal Crown Prince]] and [[Royal Crown Princess]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ebar.com/arts/art_article.php?sec=onthetown&amp;article=65|title=In the Socializing Life|last=Sachet|first=Donna|date=2007-08-23|work=[[Bay Area Reporter]]|accessdate=2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince/Princess Royale, [[Baron]]/[[Baroness]], etc. Additionally, each year the Court holds fund raising competitions to crown such titles as Royal Baby Girl &amp; Baby Boy, King &amp; Queen of Hearts, Mr. &amp; Miss Royal Bunny, Royal Daddy &amp; Royal Daddy's Boy and White Knight and Debutante.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ebar.com/common/inc/article_print.php?sec=outabout&amp;article=230|title=Queer &amp; Far|last=Provenzano|first=Jim|date=2008-06-12|work=[[Bay Area Reporter]]|accessdate=2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ebar.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ebar.com/common/inc/article_print.php?sec=outabout&amp;article=102|title=St. Nicholas' Cotillion @Mr. Lee-Ona's|last=Provenzano|first=Jim|date=2006-12-07|work=[[Bay Area Reporter]]|accessdate=2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Court added an annual fund raising pageant to crown Miss San Francisco Gold Rush.&lt;ref name="Pratt"/&gt;

== Fundraising ==
Each court conducts numerous fundraisers throughout the year.  Drag shows, ranging in size from performances at local bars to events in hotel ballrooms and other large venues, are the main way in which revenue is raised for charity.&lt;ref name="ebar.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ebar.com/arts/art_article.php?sec=inthebars&amp;article=18|title=Its No Rumor: The Club's a Hotspot|last=Sher|first=Mike|date=2005-12-22|work=[[Bay Area Reporter]]|accessdate=2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially in recent years, court chapters have diversified their fundraising strategies so as to include [[yard sales]], gift [[raffle]]s, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ebar.com/common/inc/article_print.php?sec=outabout&amp;article=239|title=Skin Is In!|last=Provenzano|first=Jim|date=2008-08-15|work=[[Bay Area Reporter]]|accessdate=2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Court members also solicit donations at [[LGBT]] events, [[gay pride parades]] and other public events at which they appear.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco donates the funds raised to a variety of causes including those related to [[AIDS]], [[breast cancer]], [[domestic abuse]], and [[homelessness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ebar.com/artscolumns/artcolumn.php?sec=onthetown&amp;id=20|title=Splashy Parties &amp; Bubbly Company|last=Sachet|first=Donna|date=2006-02-09|work=[[Bay Area Reporter]]|accessdate=2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==

While composed primarily of [[gay]] and [[transgender]] as well as [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]] and [[transwomen]], each court is open to all. Gay, [[bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transgender]] and [[heterosexual|straight]] people have all served as monarchs and court members in the system's history.&lt;ref name="in"&gt;[http://www.impcourt.org/icis/about/intro.html] Introduction to the Imperial Court System  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103060749/http://www.impcourt.org/icis/about/intro.html |date=January 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drag queen]]s collectively comprise about half of the membership.

The '''[[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Tōhoku earthquake]]''' had a significant impact on the nation of Japan, including one of its most well-known exports, '''[[video game industry|video games and gaming consoles]]'''. The damage to Japan's infrastructure prompted delays in software and hardware releases, and also caused outright cancellations when the subject matter of the software was considered too similar to real-life events. At the same time, the Japanese gaming industry took on relief efforts to assist those most directly affected by the earthquake and subsequent [[tsunami]].

Members of the gaming industry contributed donations to support foundations including several large donations from video game-oriented companies such as [[Nintendo]], [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], [[Namco Bandai]], [[Sega Sammy]], [[Capcom]], and [[Tecmo Koei]], and have also encouraged donations from individuals. Several online games helped donate money to the relief effort, including ''[[EVE Online]]'' and [[Zynga]]'s Facebook games. Thirty-six hours after the initial tremor, Zynga has gathered donations adding up to $1.35&amp;nbsp;million.

==Effects on business==
The disaster resulted in a drop in stocks at the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] for many video game companies at the Monday close following.

===Delays and cancellations===
When asked if the [[Nintendo 3DS]]' launch in Europe and North America would be affected by the situation, Nintendo gave indication that the former will be unaffected. It elaborated that business operations and future product shipments would be unaffected.&lt;ref name="gibiz"/&gt; Video games analyst [[Michael Pachter]] commented that it was difficult to assess how much impact the disaster will have, commenting that a company like Nintendo will not suffer as many set backs in the release of software as other companies have, such as Sony. He noted that if the threat of a nuclear plant meltdown grows stronger, the industry could be placed in much more dire straits. Pachter also noted that while Japanese software delays would not impact the United States market, hardware shortages could.&lt;ref name="msnbc"/&gt; Related hardware manufacturing industries have also indirectly affected video gaming.

[[Square Enix]] shut down its servers for ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy XIV (2010 video game)|Final Fantasy XIV]]'', while [[Konami]] suspended the servers for ''[[Metal Gear Online]]'' indefinitely.&lt;ref name="shacknews"/&gt; The two ''Final Fantasy'' games along with the [[PlayOnline]] service accounted for 11&amp;nbsp;percent of Square Enix's energy consumption the previous month.

The '''International Colonial and Export Exhibition''' (Dutch: ''Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling''; French: ''Exposition Universelle Coloniale et d'Exportation Générale'') was a [[colonial exhibition]] (a type of [[World's Fair]]) that was held in [[Amsterdam]] from May 1 to October 1, 1883. The event drew at least a million visitors and was the first international colonial exhibition, with 28 different nations presenting their colonial trade and wealth. 

The event was the brainchild of [[Edouard Agostini]], a French entrepreneur. Agostini, who had previously been involved in organizing the 1878 [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris, presented his plans to the city of Amsterdam and King [[William III of the Netherlands]] in 1880. The Dutch government was initially hesitant, but Agostini managed to secure funding from Belgian and French investors.

The location chosen for the exhibition was an unused area of land behind the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]], which at that time was still under construction. This area is now [[Museumplein]] square. The main building was designed by the French architect [[Paul Fouquiau]]  in "[[Moorish Revival architecture|Moorish]]" style. It was constructed of wood covered with plaster and painted cloth, in order to give the impression of marble. Between the building's two large towers, a large cloth in "Indian" style was hung, with plaster heads of elephants and other animals. The building contained pavilions representing 28 different nations, including [[France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Belgium]], [[Japan]], the [[United States]], [[China]], [[Canada]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Thailand|Siam]] (Thailand), [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], and the host country, the [[Netherlands]]. 

Items on show in the main building included a telephone, wood- and metalworking machines, and a safe large enough to fit eight people. The building's colonial section presented products such as tobacco and rubber, as well as a reconstructed [[Java]]nese-style settlement (''kampung'') with "natives". At that time, it was not considered degrading or racist to put humans on display; in fact, it became a regularly featured spectacle at such exhibitions (see further: [[Human zoo]]).

Other structures included a music pavilion; the pavilion of the city of Amsterdam; the Dutch colonial pavilion; a Japanese bazar; various shops; and Dutch, English and German restaurants. In front of the Dutch colonial pavilion was a statue of [[Jan Pieterszoon Coen]] who, as governor-general of the Dutch East Indies, played a large part in the Dutch conquest of the Indonesian archipelago. A canal with a bamboo bridge and a Chinese [[junk (ship)|junk]] intersected the exhibition grounds.

==Effects==
The exhibition, bringing more than a million visitors from around the world to Amsterdam, provided the city with a huge economic boost. A number of hotels were expanded or newly built in order to profit from the large number of visitors, including the [[American Hotel, Amsterdam|Hotel Americain]], the {{Interlanguage link multi|Doelen Hotel|nl}}, and [[Hotel Krasnapolsky]]. The expansion of the Krasnapolsky included the glass-roofed ''Wintertuin'' lounge, with [[electric light]]ing, which at that time was considered a real novelty.

In Amsterdam, modern-day remains of the exhibition are the front gate of the [[Vondelpark]] and a collection of items in the [[Tropenmuseum]] which were on show in the Dutch colonial pavilion. Some items from the Dutch colonial pavilion were also donated to the ethnological museum of [[Natura Artis Magistra|Artis]] zoo and, after this museum was closed, ended up in the Tropenmuseum as well. However, the lion's share of the thousands of items from this pavilion was donated to the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|National Museum of Ethnology]] in [[Leiden]]. Some parts of the German restaurant are now in the [[Veenkoloniaal Museum]] in [[Veendam]].

[[Heineken International|Heineken]] still uses the label ''Diplôme d'Honneur'' on its beer bottles, an honour that was bestowed on the brewer at the 1883 colonial exhibition.

In [[film]]s, an '''intertitle''' (also known as a '''title card''') is a piece of filmed, printed text edited into the midst of (i.e. ''inter-'') the photographed action at various points. Intertitles used to convey character dialogue are referred to as "dialogue intertitles", and those used to provide related descriptive/narrative material are referred to as "expository intertitles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chisholm|first=Brad|title=Reading Intertitles|year=1987|journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television|volume=15|issue=3|page=137|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01956051.1987.9944095|doi=10.1080/01956051.1987.9944095}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern usage, the terms refer to similar text and logo material inserted at or near the start of films and television shows.

==Silent film era==
In this era intertitles were always called "subtitles"&lt;ref&gt;The New Historical Dictionary of the American Film Industry, by Anthony Slide, Routledge (2014), entry on Subtitles.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Definition 4a of 'subtitle' in the Oxford English Definition: "(In) Film, Television, etc.=intertitle. Now chiefly historical."&lt;/ref&gt; and often had [[Art Deco]] motifs. They were a mainstay of [[silent film]]s once the films became of sufficient length and detail to necessitate dialogue and/or narration to make sense of the enacted or documented events. ''The British Film Catalogue'' credits the 1898 film ''Our New General Servant'' by [[Robert W. Paul]] as the first British film to use intertitles.&lt;ref&gt;The British Film Catalogue, by Denis Gifford (Routledge, 2016), page 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Film scholar Kamilla Elliott identifies another early use of intertitles in the 1901 British film ''[[Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dickens on Screen|first=Kamilla|last=Elliot|page=117|isbn=978-0521001243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mpdrgN082GoC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=1901+intertitles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nraWDTMOAp&amp;sig=bChGp_xDj1VPbJrK5I5PSKi6yIo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kaeBUPOXBerO0QXMgoDQBA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1901%20intertitles&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1st Academy Awards|first Academy Awards]] presentation in 1929 included an award for "Best Title Writing" that went to [[Joseph W. Farnham]] for no specific film. The award was never given again, as intertitles went out of common use due to the introduction of "[[Sound film|talkies]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/best-title-writing-33.html|title=Best Title Writing|work=Awards and Shows|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
In modern use, intertitles are used to supply an [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]], such as a poem, or to distinguish various "[[Act (theatre)|acts]]" of a film or multimedia production by use as a title card. However, they are most commonly used as part of a historical drama's epilogue to explain what happened to the depicted characters and events after the conclusion of the story proper.

The development of the [[soundtrack]] slowly eliminated their utility as a [[Narration|narrative]] device (they were common for providing narration, but not dialogue, well into the 1930s), but they are occasionally still used as an artistic device. For instance, intertitles were used as a [[gimmick]] in ''[[Frasier]]''. The BBC's drama ''[[Threads]]'' uses them to give location, date and information on distant events beyond [[Sheffield]]. ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' and its related spinoffs used them to give not only the location, but also the date of the upcoming scene. [[Guy Maddin]] is a modern filmmaker known for recreating the style of older films, and uses intertitles appropriately. Some locally produced shows, such as [[quiz bowl]] [[game shows]], use animated variations of intertitles to introduce the next round.

==Amateur use==
Intertitles have had a long history in the area of [[amateur film]] as well. The efforts of [[Home movies|home movie]] aficionados to intertitle their works post-production have led to the development of a number of innovative approaches to the challenge. Frequently lacking access to high quality film dubbing and splicing equipment, amateur film makers must plan ahead when making a film to allow space for filming an intertitle over the existing film. Intertitles may be printed neatly on a piece of paper, a card, or a piece of cardboard and filmed, or they may be formed from adhesive strips and affixed to glass. In the early 1980s, digital recording technology improved to the point where intertitles could be created in [[born-digital]] format and recorded directly onto the film. Several specialty accessories from this period such as Sony's HVT-2100 Titler and cameras such as Matsushita's Quasar VK-743 and Zenith VC-1800 could be used to generate intertitles for home movies.&lt;ref name=woodcock&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Woodcock |first= Roderick |author-link= Roderick Woodcock|date= May 1983 |title= The TV Den: Understanding Techniques and Technology |magazine= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 7|issue= 2|pages= 20–21|issn= 0147-8907}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}} Early 1980s video game consoles and applications catering to the [[demo scene]] were also adapted for the generation and recording of intertitles for home films. Among these were included the [[ColecoVision]], the [[Magnavox Odyssey²]] (using programs such as the ''Type &amp; Talk'' cartridge and the ''Voice'' module), the [[Bally Astrocade]] (using the built-in ''Scribbling'' program or the more advanced ''Creative Crayon'' cartridge), and the intertitle-specialized [[Famicom Titler]].&lt;ref name=woodcock/&gt;{{rp|21}}

'''Ivan Heng''' ({{zh|t=王愛仁|s=|p=Wáng Àirén}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Connect the Dots|url=http://eml.uzyn.com/hkfringe/files/pgm_guide_spotlight_singapore.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211030640/http://eml.uzyn.com/hkfringe/files/pgm_guide_spotlight_singapore.pdf|archivedate=11 February 2006|publisher=Hong Kong City Festival, [[Hong Kong Fringe Club]]|date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; born 20 September 1963) is a [[Singaporean]] actor and theatre director of [[Peranakan]] descent. He is the founding artistic director of [[W!LD RICE]], a theatre company in Singapore, and an outspoken advocate for respect for diversity and freedom of expression.

Heng is the first male Singaporean actor to break into English-speaking roles in Hollywood films with his role in [[Luc Besson]]'s ''[[The Fifth Element]]'', the first female actress from Singapore being Lydia Look, who played a Fuzhou actress in a [[Jackie Chan]] Hollywood film.

==Biography==
A theatre director, actor, playwright and designer, Heng's productions are concerned with identity, migration and gender and sexual politics within intercultural contexts. They have played festivals and theatres in more than 20 cities around the world including Melbourne International Arts Festival, New Zealand International Arts Festival, Edinburgh Fringe, ICA International Festival of the Chinese Diaspora (London), Hong Kong City Festival, [[Royal Tropical Institute]] (Netherlands), SIETAR Congress (Munich), WOTM Conference (Belgium) and Re:Map Festival (Copenhagen).&lt;ref name="Artseefartsee"/&gt;

Heng’s background is in both Asian and Western theatre traditions: training as a director with [[Kuo Pao Kun]] of Practice Performing Arts in Singapore; ballet, jazz and contemporary dance as a scholar with Dance Arts Singapore; and training with the Peking Opera in Hong Kong (Hong Kong Tang's Opera Troupe) and Singapore (Leling Peking Opera Troupe, Chinese Theatre Circle). He also spent a summer at the British American Drama Academy in Oxford. His mentor, colleague and closest collaborator was [[:zh:克里申吉|Krishen Jit]] with whom he collaborated on ''M. Butterfly'', ''The Coffin is too Big for the Hole'', ''No Parking on Odd Days'', ''Emily of Emerald Hill'' and ''The Visit of the [[Tai tai]]''.&lt;ref name="Artseefartsee"/&gt;

===Early years===
Heng was educated at [[Anglo-Chinese School]], [[Temasek Junior College]] and the [[National University of Singapore]], where he studied law from 1984 to 1988. He was admitted to practice as lawyer until the acting bug led him to various theatres, winning many awards in Edinburgh, London, Canada and finally Hollywood.&lt;ref name="Artseefartsee"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ivan Heng: Biography|url=http://www.artseefartsee.com/ivanheng/bio.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717053818/http://www.artseefartsee.com/ivanheng/bio.html|archivedate=17 July 2012|publisher=Artseefartsee.com|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heng was awarded the [[Cultural Medallion]], Singapore's highest arts honour, in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mayo Martin|title=Cultural Medallion, Young Artist Award recipients announced|url=http://www.todayonline.com/entertainment/arts/cultural-medallion-young-artist-award-recipients-announced?singlepage=true|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025011814/http://www.todayonline.com/entertainment/arts/cultural-medallion-young-artist-award-recipients-announced|archivedate=25 October 2013|work=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|date=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst studying for his law degree, Heng attended Kuo's directing workshop, acted with Singapore Theatre American Repertory Showcase (S*TARS), and directed and designed sets as a founding member of [[The Necessary Stage]].&lt;ref name="Artseefartsee"/&gt;

Heng originated the lead role of Malcolm Png in [[Michael Chiang]]'s ''Army Daze'' in 1987. He also played Frankie Wong in ''Beauty World'', and Song Liling in the All-Asian premiere of ''M. Butterfly'' in India in 1989 (a role originated on the West End by his future collaborator [[Glen Goei]]). Heng also performed in ''M. Butterfly'' at the [[Singapore Arts Festival]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="Artseefartsee"/&gt;

===Overseas work===
In 1990, Heng became the first recipient of the BAT Arts Scholarship to the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (Glasgow). He graduated with top honours, including the Royal Lyceum Theatre Award for Best Shakespearean Performance (''Richard III''), the Margaret Gordon Award for Best Final Year Performance, and the Dorothy Innes Prize for Best Studentship.&lt;ref name="Artseefartsee"/&gt;

Heng made his UK directorial debut at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival with a Singaporean play&amp;nbsp;– Ovidia Yu's ''The Woman in a Tree on the Hill''. The production won the Scotsman Edinburgh Fringe First (Singapore's first and only), as well the ''Scottish Daily Express'' New Names of '93 Award. Thereafter, he moved to London where he worked in film, television and radio, and founded the Tripitaka Theatre Company to do touring productions with an Asian point of view, like his autobiographical solo ''Journey West'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Clarissa Oon|title=On a cultural mission|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/showbiz/cultural-mission|work=[[The Straits Times]] (reproduced on [[AsiaOne]])|date=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Singapore===
In 1998, after touring extensively throughout Europe, Heng decided to return to Singapore to contribute and make a difference to Singapore's nascent arts scene.&lt;ref name="Artseefartsee"/&gt;

In 2000, Heng founded W!LD RICE. His projects for the company include directing ''The Campaign to Confer the Public Service Star on JBJ'', ''Second Link – The Singapore Malaysia Text Exchange'', ''Oi! Sleeping Beauty!!'', ''The Visit of the Tai Tai'', ''Landmarks – Asian Boys Vol.2'', ''Cinderel-lah!'', ''Animal Farm'', ''Ang Tau Mui'', ''The Woman in A Tree on the Hill'', ''An Occasional Orchid''; set designing ''The Magic Fundoshi'', ''Boeing Boeing'', ''Landmarks'', ''Ang Tau Mui'', ''Animal Farm'', ''An Occasional Orchid'', and Kuo Pao Kun's ''The Coffin is too Big for the Hole'' and ''No Parking on Odd Days''; and acting in ''The Visit of the Tai Tai'', ''For the Pleasure of Seeing Her Again'', ''Emily of Emerald Hill'', ''Animal Farm'', ''La Cage Aux Folles'' and ''The Importance of Being Earnest''.&lt;ref name="Artseefartsee"/&gt;

Other highlights of his career include acting in ''Army Daze'', ''Beauty World'' (both original casts) and ''M. Butterfly'' (India, Canada, Singapore); conceiving and directing ''Ah Kong's Birthday Party'' (Singapore's longest-running play); directing ''Dim Sum Dollies Steaming!'' and ''Singapore's Most Wanted'' (Esplanade Theatre), ''Phua Chu Kang: the Musical'' for the President of Singapore’s Star Charity, Puccini’s ''Madama Butterfly'' for the Singapore Lyric Opera (Esplanade Theatre), and co-directing and performing in ''Hotel Grand Asia'', a three-year intercultural collaboration involving 16 theatre artists from seven cities at the Setagaya Public Theatre in Tokyo.&lt;ref name="Artseefartsee"/&gt;

In 2006, Heng was Artistic Director of the inaugural Singapore Theatre Festival, which was presented by W!LD RICE and featured nine productions by five theatre companies, including five World Premieres, seminars and workshops. In 2009, he served as Creative Director for Singapore's [[Singapore National Day Parade|National Day Parade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insing.com/news/celebrities-entertainment/Interview-Leading-the-Parade/id-93120100/?nav=60000]. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he was Creative Director for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the inaugural [[Youth Olympic Games]] held in Singapore.

Heng's awards for excellence in theatre include the Edinburgh Fringe First, ''Scottish Daily Express'' New Names of '93 Award, Edinburgh Spirit of the Fringe 1995, Singapore Young Artist Award 1996, the Singapore Youth Award 1998, the ''Straits Times Life!'' Theatre Award for Best Director 2002, the Singapore Tatler Leadership Award for Culture (2006) and the Cultural Medallion in 2013.&lt;ref name="Artseefartsee"/&gt;
 
He shares his practice by giving workshops internationally, and has taught at the Central School of Speech and Drama (London), Tramway (Glasgow), Intercult (Stockholm), Kannonhallen (Denmark), Dramalab (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), and [[LASALLE College of the Arts]] in Singapore. He was also a participant at London's Royal Court Theatre 10th International Summer Residency.&lt;ref name="Artseefartsee"/&gt;

In August 2014, Heng married his long-time partner Tony Trickett in London. Heng met Trickett, now the executive director of W!LD RICE, in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Boon Chan|title=Ivan Heng weds his partner of 18 years on a 'perfect British summer's day'|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/theatre-dance/story/ivan-heng-weds-his-partner-18-years-perfect-british-summers-day-201408|work=The Straits Times|date=3 August 2014|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Jovian was born on April 10, 1994, at the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]], to Nigel and Flavia, [[Coquerel's sifaka]] lemurs. 

When [[Martin Kratt]] and his younger brother [[Chris Kratt|Chris]] wanted a lemur co-host for their TV show ''[[Zoboomafoo]]'', Martin returned to the Duke Lemur Center, where he had previously volunteered while a student at [[Duke University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kfor.com/2014/11/12/lemur-famous-from-pbs-show-zoboomafoo-dies/|title=Lemur famous from PBS show 'Zoboomafoo' dies|publisher=KFOR|date=2014-11-12|accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the Kratts prepared for the show by filming Jovian and his parents jumping around an outdoor cage modelled on the stage set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/jovian-lemur-star-kratt-brothers-wildlife-tv-show-zoboomafoo-dead-20-1722384|title=Jovian, Lemur Star of Kratt Brothers' Wildlife TV Show 'Zoboomafoo', Dead At 20|first=Julia|last=Glum|work=International Business Times|date=2014-11-12|accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jovian appeared on the program from January 1999 to November 2001. Jovian would appear mostly in the opening segments, before transforming into a talking lemur puppet after eating his meals.&lt;ref name="isabella" /&gt;

Zoboomafoo's voice was provided by veteran [[Canadians|Canadian]] puppeteer Gord Robertson.

After appearing on the show, Jovian was credited with attracting 15,000 visitors to the Duke Lemur Center each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/columnist/guest-columns/2004-03-30-jacobson_x.htm|title=Looking for lemurs|first=Louis|last=Jacobson|work=USA Today|date=2004-03-30|accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the center's breeding program, Jovian mated with a lemur named Pia. One of their offspring, Charlemagne, was taken to a different habitat after Jovian rejected him from the family group.&lt;ref name="duke-2011" /&gt; Jovian became ill in the late winter of 2013. He lost a large amount of weight in June 2014 and would only eat in his cage. Pia became pregnant shortly before his death.&lt;ref name="cvc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/jovian-the-lemur-from-pbs-s-zoboomafoo-dead-at-20-1.2832381|title=Jovian, the lemur from PBS' Zoboomafoo, dead at 20|publisher=CBC News|date=2014-11-12|accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2014, Jovian died in his home at the Duke Lemur Center at the age of 20. News of his death spread quickly worldwide, with an outpouring of grief from the public and media industry.&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt;&lt;ref name=tech&gt;{{cite web|title='Zoboomafoo' star Jovian the lemur has died|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/20044/20141112/zoboomafoo-lemur-has-died.htm|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wtic&gt;{{cite web|title=Lemur famous from PBS show ‘Zoboomafoo’ dead at 20|url=http://foxct.com/2014/11/12/lemur-famous-from-pbs-show-zoboomafoo-dead-at-20/|publisher=[[WTIC-TV]]|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;{{cite web|title=Internet mourns loss of celebrity lemur Zoboomafoo|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/11/12/zoboomafoo-dies-internet-reacts/18902779/|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first relative of Jovian to be born after his death was his granddaughter Isabella, born on January 25, 2015.&lt;ref name="isabella"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://today.duke.edu/2015/03/isabella|first=Christopher|last=Smith|publisher=Duke University|title=Zoboomafoo's granddaughter born at Duke|date=2015-03-02|accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="90647">This is a list of both active and inactive '''''Pro Wrestling Illustrated'' awards''' which are voted on by ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'' (''PWI'') readers every year from 1972 onwards, expanding to more categories in later years.

Unlike other wrestling magazines and websites, ''PWI'' is largely a magazine written within the fictional realm of [[professional wrestling]] and the awards recognize this.

== Active awards ==

=== Wrestler of the Year ===
[[File:Ric Flair 2016.jpg|thumb|upright| [[Ric Flair]] is a six-time winner of the category]]
The ''PWI'' '''Wrestler of the Year''' award recognizes the best professional wrestler of the year. [[Ric Flair]] has won the award a record six times.

=== Inspirational Wrestler of the Year ===
The ''PWI'' '''Inspirational Wrestler of the Year''' award recognizes the most inspirational professional wrestler of the year. The award has been given yearly since 1972, and in this time, [[Bob Backlund]], [[Hulk Hogan]], [[Jerry Lawler]], [[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]] and [[Eddie Guerrero]] are the only people to have won the award more than once, with all five winning twice. Generally, the award is meant to go to a wrestler who overcomes great odds to achieve success in the ring, although it has also been awarded to wrestlers who overcome real-life hardships and struggles.

A '''microgame''' (sometimes written "'''MicroGame'''") is a [[board game]] or [[Wargaming|wargame]] packaged in a small set.

==Description==
Microgames enjoyed popularity during the 1980s and have seen a revival with the popularity of tabletop games in the 21st century.  The term generally refers to board games or wargames which were packaged and sold with instructions and maps or playing surfaces printed in a booklet format, or as one large sheet folded until it became "pocket sized" (approximately 4×7 inches). Game pieces (also known as [[Chit (board wargames)|chits]] or [[Counter (board wargames)|counters]]) were printed on one or more sheets of thick paper which the player sometimes had to cut for themselves.  Other microgames had fully die-cut cardboard sheets like those included with most board wargames.&lt;ref&gt;  While the exact definition of "[https://geekdad.com/2013/12/microgames/ microgame]" is not fixed, many games have been so called, and [[Where Art Thou, Romeo?]] was the first self-styled "[https://crashofgames.com/ nanogame]".

While small scale wargames and board games, including Tabletop Games' Micro Series Games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://life-in-miniature.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/series-2-games-micro-warfare.html |title=Series 2 games - Micro Warfare |date=September 6, 2014 |first=Peter |last=Brown |work=life in miniature}}&lt;/ref&gt; had existed before they began publishing, [[Metagaming Concepts]] first used the term "[[MicroGame]]" when they released ''[[Ogre (game)|Ogre]], MicroGame #1'' in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maverick.brainiac.com/cmm/mic.html |title=The Metagaming MicroGame Games, Page 1 |date=March 2, 2002 |first=Joseph |last=Scoleri III |work=The Maverick's Classic Microgames Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miss &amp; Mister Deaf World''' (MMDW) is an international beauty pageant which crowns young Deaf women to "Miss Deaf World" and young Deaf men to "Mister Deaf World" every year, usually in [[Prague]], in the [[Czech Republic]].

== History ==
MMDW is a [[Nonprofit organization]] which was created in 2001. The pageant is organised by companies MISS DEAF [[Společnost s ručením omezeným|s.r.o.]] and MISS – MISTER DEAF s.r.o., and their president is Josef Uhlir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Facebook|josef.uhlir.missdeaf|Josef Uhlir}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The official language in the contest is [[International Sign|International Sign Language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PV|url=https://www.parlamentnilisty.cz/politika/obce-volicum/Praha-6-Nejkrasnejsi-muz-sveta-pracuje-na-radnici-555139|title=The most beautiful man of the world works in the town hall|website=ParlamentniListy|language=cs|date=12 October 2018|accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[lead glass|crystal]] crowns for all the finalists are made by Astera-glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astera-glass.cz/projekty/miss-deaf-world/?weblang=en|title=Miss Deaf World|website=Astera glass|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the rules of the contest, a winner is disallowed to participate in another beauty contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://www.missdeafworld2011-2020.com/files/en/rules.pdf|title=MDW Contest Rules|website=Miss Deaf World 2011–2020|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 9, 2010 there was a MDW contest in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/display.php?url=http://www.missdeafworld2011-2020.com/images/gallery/2010/001.jpg|title=MDW contest in Georgia|website=Miss Deaf World 2011–2020|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/display.php?url=http://www.missdeafworld2011-2020.com/images/gallery/2010/003.jpg|title=MDW contest in Georgia|website=Miss Deaf World 2011–2020|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Miss Julie Abbou from [[France]] contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/display.php?url=http://www.missdeafworld2011-2020.com/images/gallery/2010/030.jpg|title=Julie Abbou at the MDW contest in Georgia|website=Miss Deaf World 2011–2020|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won three titles of the first Vicemiss Deaf World 2010, the second Vicemiss Deaf World 2010 and of the Miss Sympathy Deaf World 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sourds.net/2010/07/25/miss-deaf-world-2010-miss-deaf-europe-2010|title=MISS Deaf World 2010 &amp; MISS Deaf Europe 2010|website=Sourds net, Le Portail D'Information sur les Sourds|language=fr|date=2010-07-25|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lns.lv/lat/?doc=2802|title=Miss Deaf World 2010 for the first time had a representative from Latvia|website=Latvian Association of the Deaf|language=lv|date=2010-07-30|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Abbou contested Miss Deaf International&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://missmisterdeafinternational.org|title=Miss &amp; Mister Deaf International|website=MMDI|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] on July 31, 2010, and was crowned as Miss Deaf International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sourds.net/2010/08/13/miss-deaf-international-a-las-vegas|title=Miss Deaf International in Las Vegas|website=Sourds net, Le Portail D'Information sur les Sourds|language=fr|date=2010-08-13|publisher=video length 3:11 minutes|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Uhlir published an announcement at MDW website about disqualifying Abbou from the titles of 1st Vicemiss Deaf World 2010 and of Miss Sympathy Deaf World 2010, which Abbou won during the final ceremony of Miss Deaf World 2010 and Miss Deaf Europe 2010 competitions in Tbilisi. Uhlir stated that during the MDW competitions, Abbou was personally informed, as well as the other competing girls, that in the case of receiving one of the official titles of the MDW competitions, the winner was prohibited from participation in any other Miss competition. Uhlir explained the reason for keeping the high status of the both competitions, keeping the high reputation of the gained titles and preventing any hurt of Miss Deaf World and Miss Deaf Europe competitions prestige. Uhlir added that every girl could participate these competitions, even two times, if she was not awarded any of the titles during her first participation. He wrote that with validity from August 1st, 2010, the title of first Vicemiss Deaf World 2010, which was taken from Abbou, went to Zhihuang Wang from [[China]], and her title of second Vicemiss Deaf World 2010 went to Stella Falawo Kunjan from [[Ghana]], which took originally the fourth place. The title of Miss Sympathy Deaf World 2010, which also was taken from Abbou by Uhlir, would be won by Portia Oliver from [[South Africa]], which took originally the second place in this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://www.missdeafworld2011-2020.com/index/miss/year/2010/lang/en|title=Announcement of president of Miss Deaf World and Miss Deaf Europe, Mr. Josef Uhlir|website=Miss Deaf World 2011–2020|date=2010-08-01|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Assia Uhanany from Israel won Miss Deaf World. Xu Jinghui, a contestant from China, took a photo with her,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Xu Jinghui|url=https://www.facebook.com/100010957456760/posts/731447083897200|title=Xu Jinghui and Assia Uhanany|website=[[Facebook]]|date=1 October 2018|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote her impression of the contest. She told about the foreign environment in Prague, wishing to contact foreign Deaf friends from different countries, hopefully communicating with them. She wrote her dailiy activity: The second day was a free day, and they visited close attractions, starting to make Deaf friends by chatting each other with the international sign language. The third day to the sixth day went at class, practicing the show together, and sharing international sign language and [[Deaf culture]] among different countries. The show started on September 29, 2018, left her a little sad and discouraged, but it was a rare experience for her. She was happy to be able to go abroad and acquire a lot of foreign friends, and thanked the China Association of the Deaf for giving her such a chance to go abroad, and for teaching her international sign language as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Xu Jinghui|url=https://www.facebook.com/100010957456760/posts/731447527230489|title=On the first day with the foreign environment in the Czech Republic, I was excited, a little scared and too shy|website=[[Facebook]]|date=1 October 2018|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''music store''' or '''musical instrument store'''  is a retail business that sells [[musical instrument]]s and related equipment and accessories.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/industries/Retail-Trade/Musical-Instrument-Stores.html&lt;/ref&gt; In United States and Canada, most music stores in the 2010s sell a range of electric instruments (e.g., electric guitars), [[instrument amplifier]]s (e.g., [[guitar amplifier]]s); electronic instruments (e.g., synthesizers); drum kits (including drums, [[cymbal]]s and percussion instruments) and acoustic classical, [[concert band]] and [[jazz]] musical instruments such as saxophones, trumpets and violins. In addition, stores typically sell (and sometimes rent) the [[sound reinforcement system]] and [[PA system]] gear used in live concert performances and the [[sound recording]] equipment used to record music, such as microphones and digital recorders.

In the 2010s, music stores can be "[[bricks and mortar]]" stores (either individual [[small business]]es or [[chain store]]s, which may be a regional or national chain); online musical instrument stores, which consist of a website describing the merchandise, various online payment systems, and shipping or delivery systems; or hybrid stores that have both "bricks and mortar" stores and an online store. Some "bricks and mortar" music stores also provide services for a fee, such as [[music lesson]]s, musical instrument repair and guitar amplifier repair.

==Products==
In the 2010s, general music stores typically carry a range of instruments used in [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]] such as the electric guitar, acoustic guitar, electric bass, [[guitar string]]s, [[instrument amplifier]]s ([[guitar amplifier]], [[bass amplifier]] and [[keyboard amplifier]]), [[effects unit|electronic effects]] (e.g., [[distortion (music)|distortion]] [[effects unit|pedals]]), [[electronic keyboard]]s (including [[digital piano]]s, [[stage piano]]s, [[clonewheel organ]]s and synthesizers), drum kit components, which include drums, [[cymbal]]s, drum and cymbal stands and drum accessories ([[drum stick]]s, drum heads, etc.) and percussion instruments (e.g., [[tambourine]], [[shaker]]s, etc.). Some stores carry other types of stringed instruments, such as [[mandolin]]s and [[ukulele]]s.

General music stores also typically carry [[sound reinforcement system]] gear such as [[microphone]]s, small-to mid-sized [[mixing console]]s designed for live sound, [[speaker enclosure]]s, [[PA system]]s, [[power amplifier]]s and mic stands and [[sound recording]] equipment such as studio microphones, recording-oriented mixing consoles, [[digital recording]] systems, [[digital audio workstation]]s and digital audio software (e.g., [[softsynth]]s, [[Software synthesizer|virtual instruments]], [[ProTools]], etc.).
[[File:Cascio Interstate Music SuperStore Acoustic Guitar Cabin.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|A selection of acoustic guitars at Cascio Interstate Music SuperStore.]]
General music stores often carry a range of music accessories used during [[rehearsal]]s and performances, such as [[metronome]]s, [[electronic tuner]]s, [[music stand]]s, stand lights and conducting batons.

General music stores may also sell [[brass instrument]]s (e.g., [[trombone]], trumpet, etc.), woodwind instruments ([[flute]], [[clarinet]], saxophone, etc.) and instruments from the violin family (violin, [[viola]], cello and [[double bass|bass]]), but there is usually a smaller selection of these instruments, as compared with the guitar, bass and drum sections.

Some music stores also sell [[sheet music]], including [[popular music]], [[traditional music]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] songs, [[movie soundtrack]] scores, classical music pieces and instrument methods and studies ("etudes"). In the 2010s, some stores also sell instructional music DVDs and play-along CDs, which typically contain sheet music with the written melodies, which the performer can play or sing while a recording of each song or piece's [[accompaniment]] plays on a CD player.

===Services===
Some music stores also provide services to customers for a fee, such as instrument maintenance and repair, amplifier and sound gear repairs, and/or [[music lesson]]s. Some music stores rent guitars, basses, amplifiers, [[stage piano]]s and [[PA system]] equipment.

==Specialized stores==

Larger cities may have a large enough population to support both general music stores and specialized music stores. Music stores in smaller towns tend to be general music stores, because there is not enough of a customer base to support specialized music stores. In the 2010s, general music stores have had to face competition from online music stores, which offer a huge selection of instruments and equipment.

===Electric guitars===

Electric guitars started appearing in the 1930&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and are one of the most popular [[musical instrument]]s to buy from a music store. Electric guitars can be heard in all types of music from pop, rock, [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[funk]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gak.co.uk/en/electric-guitars|title=Electric Guitars {{!}} Shop Electric Guitars {{!}} GAK|website=www.gak.co.uk|access-date=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream electric guitars stores sell well-known brands like [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] and [[Ibanez]]. Most guitar stores sell [[6-string guitar|six-string]] models, bass guitars, [[left handed guitar]]s and electric guitar packages for beginners, which typically include a budget-priced electric guitar, a small practice amplifier, a strap and picks.

''Guitar World'' magazine states that since guitar stores require patrons to try out guitars and amplifiers in the premises, some guitar players are nervous about playing in front of the store staff and other patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/artist-news-viral-videos/dont-be-nervous-play-guitar-store/31147 |title=Don't Be Nervous to Play in a Guitar Store |last=Larson |first=Tyler|date=September 5, 2017 |website=''guitarworld.com'' |publisher=Guitar World |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The columnist, Tyler Larson, states that apart from playing too loud, which is avoided, patrons should feel confident to test out the guitars and amplifiers in the guitar stores, because "...real musicians never look down on anybody for being at a different skill level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/artist-news-viral-videos/dont-be-nervous-play-guitar-store/31147 |title=Don't Be Nervous to Play in a Guitar Store |last=Larson |first=Tyler|date=September 5, 2017 |website=''guitarworld.com'' |publisher=Guitar World |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[University Press of Kentucky]] book on [[women in music]] states that customers did not treat a woman who worked at a guitar store like she knew anything about guitars until she would use special guitar terms.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Mina; Lewis, Tina; Shaw, Susan M. ''Girls Rock! Fifty Years of Women Making Music''. University Press of Kentucky. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Indie folk singer-songwriter/guitarist [[Ani di Franco]] states that for women, in the past, even entering a guitar store was an "act of courage" because it felt like a "boys' club".&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Mina; Lewis, Tina; Shaw, Susan M. ''Girls Rock! Fifty Years of Women Making Music''. University Press of Kentucky. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Piano===
[[File:1905 - H S Schultz Piano Store Interior.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The H.S. Schultz Piano Store in 1905.]]
One common specialty store is the piano store, which typically sells a range of [[upright piano]]s and [[grand piano]]s. In the 2010s, some piano shops also sell grand pianos equipped with a digital [[player piano]] mechanism that can play back a recorded performance by activating the hammers. In the 2010s, some piano stores sell high-end [[digital piano]]s.

In 2015, ''The Guardian'' reported that in the US, piano stores have been closing, "...as kids snub lessons for other activities" such as amateur sports, as people taking piano lessons opt for much less costly "electronic keyboards or used pianos" and as children in the 2010s shift their interests away from traditional activities like piano lessons and towards newer computer-oriented activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/02/piano-stores-closing-kids-snub-lessons-compete-technology |title=Piano stores closing across US as kids snub lessons for other activities |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=January 2, 2015 |work= The Guardian|access-date=September 4, 2017 |quote=When Jim Foster opened his piano store 30 years ago, he had 10 competitors selling just pianos. When he closed Foster Family Music in late December, not one was still selling pianos in the Quad-Cities area of Iowa and Illinois. "We did try hard to find a buyer," Foster said. There were no takers. Stores dedicated to selling pianos like Foster's are dwindling across the country as fewer people take up the instrument and those who do often opt for a less expensive electronic keyboard or a used piano. Some blame computers and others note the high cost of new pianos, but what's clear is that a long-term decline in sales has accelerated. The best year for new piano sales in the US was 1909, when more than 364,500 were sold. But after gently falling over the years, piano sales have plunged more recently to between 30,000 and 40,000 annually.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another challenge for piano stores selling new instruments is that there are piano technicians who repair good-quality used pianos and sell them at much less than the cost of a new instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/02/piano-stores-closing-kids-snub-lessons-compete-technology |title=Piano stores closing across US as kids snub lessons for other activities |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=January 2, 2015 |work= The Guardian|access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some piano stores offer rental of new pianos; as well, some piano stores sell used pianos.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Neil. ''The Piano Lessons Book''. December 8, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-4348-1853-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, it was reported that historic Detroit piano stores were closing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.axs.com/detroit-piano-stores-closing-amid-country-s-lack-of-interest-in-ebony--35842 |title=Detroit piano stores closing amid country's lack of interest in ebony and ivory |last=Ferro |first=Michael |date=January 5, 2015 |website=''axs.com'' |publisher=AXS.com |access-date=September 4, 2015 |quote=All across the country, there's a sad epidemic spreading much like the annual winter curse of the flu that sidelines scores of people each year. This sickness, though, is one of the heart, and of the soul, as many historic piano stores across the nation are closing their doors as interest in the once-immensely popular instrument fades in the modern era. It's no secret that pianos are becoming less and less popular in today's modern home, as reported by new statistics released this week. Nowhere is that more evident than in Detroit, with piano sales plummeting here in the Motor City. With so many homes in foreclosure and many other buildings, such as schools, dilapidated and awaiting to be torn down, pianos are a much more common sight to see backed away into the corner of a dusty garage or left behind after a hasty foreclosure from the bank. In short, pianos are a luxury that Detroiters simply seem to be able to no longer afford.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, in 2015, it was reported that "...US piano stores [are being] forced to close as recession, new technology [such as electronic keyboards] and cultural change take their toll."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-15/piano-sales-plunge-in-united-states/6248428 |title=US piano stores forced to close as recession, new technology and cultural change take their toll |last=Millar |first=Lisa |date=March 15, 2015 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor in the declining sales of pianos in the US is that pianos last a long time; high-quality, properly-maintained pianos can remain playable for 60 to 80 years after their original purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-15/piano-sales-plunge-in-united-states/6248428 |title=US piano stores forced to close as recession, new technology and cultural change take their toll |last=Millar |first=Lisa |date=March 15, 2015 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high price of pianos is one factor that is causing the closing of piano stores: "A good grand piano from a respected name costs about as much as a luxury automobile", and as such, children (and their parents) are choosing less expensive instruments, such as electronic keyboards or stringed instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/opinion/columns/story/2015/may/21/piano-stores-and-americeconomics/305469/ |title=Kennedy: Piano stores and American economics |last=Kennedy |first=Mark|website=''timesfreepress.com'' |publisher=Times Free Press |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in China, "piano sales are booming", with most of these piano sales being intended for home use; this rise in sales is in part because the costly instruments are viewed as a [[status symbol]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-15/piano-sales-plunge-in-united-states/6248428 |title=US piano stores forced to close as recession, new technology and cultural change take their toll |last=Millar |first=Lisa |date=March 15, 2015 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the basement below the [[Steinway]] piano showroom in New York City, a selection of professional grand pianos are available, so that visiting piano performers playing a recital or doing a [[sound recording]] can select the instrument with their preferred sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/nyregion/steinway-piano-showroom-is-moving-to-a-new-home-in-midtown.html |title=Changing Keys, Steinway Piano Store Will Relocate in Midtown |last=Barron |first=John |date=October 29, 2014 |work=The New York Times |access-date=September 4, 2017 |quote=Steinway plans to use the space beneath the showroom the way it has long used the basement on 57th Street, as a destination for concert pianists who can try different instruments and choose one for their recitals or recording sessions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violin family===
Another specialty shop is the "violin shop", which, despite its name, often sells various violin family instruments (violin, viola, cello and often double bass, and the bows, strings, [[rosin]], chinrests, and other accessories used with these instruments). Violin shops are often operated by [[luthier]]s (violinmakers) who make violin family instruments and bows for sale. Luthiers also do maintenance and repairs on violin family instruments and bows.

According to ''PBS Newshour'', one US violinmaker who sells his instruments is combining his extensive knowledge of centuries-old violin-building techniques with 2010s-era technology such as "[[CT scan]]s" and "3D lasers", which are giving him new insights into his violin design and construction approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/violinmaker-uses-ct-scans-3d-lasers-hone-craft/ |title=Violinmaker uses CT scans, 3D lasers to hone craft |last=Kargbo |first=Connie |date=June 21, 2014 |website=''pbs.org'' |publisher=PBS Newshour |access-date=September 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sheet music===
[[Sheet music]] stores sell printed classical music for songs, instrumental solo pieces, [[chamber music]], and scores for major symphonies and choral works, along with instrumental method books, "etudes" (studies) and graded musical exercises. Many sheet music stores also carry printed music songs for [[popular music]] genres such as rock, pop and musical theatre including individual songs and collections of songs grouped by artist, musical, or genre. Music for guitarists or electric bass players may be in [[tabulature]] notation, which depicts where on the instrument the performer should play a line. In the 2010s, sheet music stores often sell legal, copyright-compliant [[jazz]] [[fake book]]s. Sheet music stores often carry some practice accessories, such as [[metronome]]s, [[music stand]]s and [[tuning fork]]s.

===Other single category stores===
Specialized music stores that sell only guitars, only basses or only drums are more likely to be found in major cities. Guitar and bass-focused stores typically sell instruments and the amplifiers and [[effects unit|effects pedals]] used with these instruments.

===Pro audio===
{{Main|Professional audio store}}
Pro audio stores sell and in many cases, rent [[sound reinforcement system]] components, [[PA system]]s, [[microphone]]s and other audio gear. Some stores also rent "backline" musical gear, such as [[stage piano]]s and [[bass amp]]s.

===Organ stores===
Prior to the widespread availability of lightweight electronic [[clonewheel organ]]s in the 1980s and 1990s that emulate the sound of a heavy, electromechanical [[Hammond organ]], many cities had organ stores which sold large electric and electronic [[theatre organ]]s and [[spinet organ]]s made by Hammond, Lowrey and other manufacturers. These organs were sold for use in private homes and in churches; electric and electronic organs were popular for churches, because they cost significantly less than a [[pipe organ]].

==Used stores==
[[Image:Acoustic bass guitar 1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A music store display showing an acoustic bass guitar and a variety of bass "combo" amplifiers and speaker cabinets.]]

Some music stores sell used, [[Vintage music equipment|vintage or collectible instruments and sound gear]], often using a [[consignment]] model, in which the store only pays the seller for her instrument when it is sold. Even though there has been a major shift towards the use of electronic and digital instruments and sound gear in the 2000s, there is still a strong interest in vintage instruments amongst musicians who play [[blues]], [[roots rock]], [[Americana (music)|Americana]] and [[indie rock]]. Vintage instruments that are sought out include 1950s and 1960s [[Hammond organ]]s, [[Fender Bassman]] amps and electric guitars, 1970s [[Fender Rhodes]] electric pianos and old analog effects, such as 1970s and 1980s [[stompbox]] pedals. Stores that mostly sell used equipment may also sell some new merchandise, such as new [[guitar string]]s, [[patch cord]]s and mic cables. Conversely, some stores that mostly sell new equipment may also sell some vintage, used equipment (typically a small number of high-priced collectible instruments).

==Online stores==
In the 2000s, some music stores sell their instruments and sound gear through a website that contains digital photos of the equipment, which are grouped into categories (e.g., electric guitars, amplifiers, PA gear). Each photo of a product is accompanied by the name and model number of each item, a description of each product's features and the price. The sophistication of online music stores varies. Some online music stores have a single photo of the item, the product name and price, and a few bullets about the features. On the other hand, some online music stores have interactive [[Web 2.0]] features, such as 360-degree [[virtual reality]]-style images of the products, in which the viewer can "turn" the product around to see the back and sides, online comments sections where customers can review their purchases and additional music-related content, such as articles on musical instruments or sound gear written by store staff. Patrons pay electronically at online music stores using a credit card, [[PayPal]] or other electronic payment systems. The goods are shipped through the mail or by express delivery companies such as [[FedEx]]. Some music stores sell their products solely online. In other cases, some stores operate both a "bricks and mortar" store (or chain) and an online store.

'''Phil Silvers''' (May 11, 1911 – November 1, 1985) was an American entertainer and comedic actor, known as "The King of [[Chutzpah]]". He starred in ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'', a 1950s [[sitcom]] set on a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] post in which he played Master Sergeant Ernest (Ernie) Bilko.

==Early life and career==
Born '''Philip Silver'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=This Laugh Is on Me: The Phil Silvers Story |author=Silvers, Phil |author2=Saffron, Robert |page=15 |publisher=[[Prentice-Hall]] |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. |year=1973 |isbn=0-13-919100-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Philip Silversmith'''&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;http://www.britannica.com/biography/Phil-Silvers&lt;/ref&gt; on May 11, 1911, in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in the working-class [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] section,&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Hal.[http://www.answers.com/topic/phil-silvers "AMG Allmovie Guide. Phil Silvers Biography"] answers.com, accessed November 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; he was the eighth and youngest child of [[Russian Jewish]] immigrants, Saul and Sarah (née Handler) Silver. His siblings were Lillian, Harry, Jack, Saul, Pearl, Michael, and Reuben Silver. His father, a sheet metal worker, helped build the early New York skyscrapers.

Silvers began entertaining aged 11, when he would sing in theaters when the film projector broke down (a common occurrence in those days), to the point where he was allowed to keep attending the same movie theater free of charge, to sing through any future breakdowns.&lt;ref name=master&gt;[http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/artist/phil-silvers "Phil Silvers"] masterworksbroadway.com, accessed November 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; By age 13, he was working as a singer in the [[Gus Edwards]] Revue, and then worked in vaudeville and as a burlesque comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monush|first= Barry|title=Screen World Presents the Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors: From the silent era to 1965|year=2003|publisher= Hal Leonard Corporation|ISBN=1-55783-551-9|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=toTIb1Ek2WwC&amp;pg=PA681&amp;lpg=PA681&amp;dq=%22Phil+Silvers%22+%22This+Laugh+Is+On+Me%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ek0036OgNE&amp;sig=ntlkIhyt02VCsdV_v5HOayb3pOw&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Phil%20Silvers%22%20%22This%20Laugh%20Is%20On%20Me%22&amp;f=false "Phil Silvers" 681]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silvers next worked in short films for the [[Vitaphone]] studio, such as ''[[Ups and Downs (1937 film)|Ups and Downs]]'' (1937), and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], where he made his début in the short-lived show ''Yokel Boy'' in 1939. Critics raved about Silvers, who was hailed as the bright spot in the mediocre play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bordman |first= Gerald and Norton, Richard |page=575 (link: [https://books.google.com/books?id=OVdShkzkX74C&amp;pg=PA575&amp;dq=%22Yokel+Boy%22+%22Phil+Silvers%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Yokel%20Boy%22%20%22Phil%20Silvers%22&amp;f=false 'Yokel Boy']) |title= American Musical Theatre: A Chronicle |year=2010 |publisher= Oxford University Press| ISBN= 0-19-972970-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broadway revue ''High Kickers'' (1941) was based on his concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suskin|first= Steven|title=The Sound of Broadway Music|year=2011|publisher= Oxford University Press| ISBN= 0-19-979084-1|page=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yy_9UJLhAUMC&amp;lpg=PT407&amp;pg=PT407#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false 123]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his feature film début in ''Hit Parade of 1941'' in 1940&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Bosley.[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9502EED61E3CE73ABC4D53DFB467838B659EDE "Movie Review: 'Hit Parade of 1941' at Loew's Criterion"] ''The New York Times'', December 5, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; (his previous appearance as a 'pitch man' in ''[[Strike Up the Band (film)|Strike Up the Band]]'' was cut). Over the next two decades, he worked as a [[character actor]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], and [[20th Century Fox]], in such films as ''[[All Through the Night (film)|All Through the Night]]'' (1942) with [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Around the same time, he played a scene with [[W. C. Fields]] in ''[[Tales of Manhattan]]'' (also 1942) which was cut from the original release, but restored decades later in home video issues. Silvers also appeared in ''[[Lady Be Good (1941 film)|Lady Be Good]]'' (1941), ''[[Coney Island (1943 film)|Coney Island]]'' (1943), ''[[Cover Girl (film)|Cover Girl]]'' (1944), with [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Rita Hayworth]], and ''[[Summer Stock]]'' (1950).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fandango.com/philsilvers/filmography/p65703|title=Phil Silvers Filmography|publisher=www.fandango.com|accessdate= November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the studio system began to decline, he returned to the stage.

Silvers wrote the lyrics for [[Frank Sinatra]]'s "[[Nancy (With the Laughing Face)]]". Although he was not a songwriter, he wrote the lyrics while visiting composer [[Jimmy Van Heusen]]. The two composed the song for Van Heusen's writing partner [[Johnny Burke (lyricist)|Johnny Burke]], for his wife Bessie's birthday. Substituting Sinatra's little daughter's name Nancy at her birthday party, the trio pressed the singer to record it himself. The song became a popular hit in 1945 and was a staple in Sinatra's live performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yw40lISdzJkC&amp;pg=PA443&amp;dq=Van+Heusen+%22Phil+Silvers%22+%22Nancy%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Van%20Heusen%20%22Phil%20Silvers%22%20%22Nancy%22&amp;f=false|title= Frank Sintra : The Complete Guide|publisher=Google eBook|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the [[Second World War]], Silvers entertained the troops during several successful overseas [[United Service Organizations|USO tour]]s with Sinatra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first= Maxene; Gilbert, Bill|year=1993|title= Over Here, Over There: The Andrews Sisters and the USO Stars in World War II|publisher= Thorndike Press| ISBN= 978-0-7862-0094-8|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silvers scored a major triumph in ''[[Top Banana (musical)|Top Banana]]'', a Broadway show of 1952. Silvers played Jerry Biffle, the egocentric, always-busy star of a major television show. (The character is said to have been based on [[Milton Berle]].) Silvers dominated the show and won a [[Tony Award]] for his performance. He repeated the role in [[Top Banana (film)|the 1954 film version]] which was initially released in [[3-D film|3-D]].&lt;ref name=master/&gt;

According to the documentary on the DVD of ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'', Silvers was not a traditional comedian: he was a comic actor. Silvers never did stand-up, and, out of character, he was not known for cracking jokes.

==1950s fame and later career==
[[File:Phil silvers as bilko.JPG|thumb|left|170px|Silvers as Sgt. Bilko]]
Silvers became a household name in 1955 when he starred as Sergeant Ernest G. Bilko in ''You'll Never Get Rich'', later retitled ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]''. The military comedy became a television hit, with the opportunistic Bilko fast-talking his way through one obstacle after another. In 1958, CBS switched the show to be telecast on Friday nights and moved the setting to Camp Fremont in California. A year later, the show was off the schedule.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;Gomery, Douglas.[http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=silversphil "Phil Silvers"]''The Museum of Broadcast Communications'' (museum.tv), accessed November 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Silvers returned to Broadway in the musical ''[[Do Re Mi (musical)|Do Re Mi]]'' in December 1960, receiving a nomination for the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical]]. Stanley Green wrote, "It was particularly blessed by offering two outstanding clowns in Phil Silvers as the pushiest of patsies and [[Nancy Walker]]."&lt;ref&gt;Green, Stanley and Green, Kay.[https://books.google.com/books?id=KDKFHniTy1YC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq=%22Jule+Styne%22+%22Do+Re+Mi%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jule%20Styne%22%20%22Do%20Re%20Mi%22&amp;f=false "'Do Re Mi'"]''Broadway Musicals, Show By Show'' (1996, 5ed.), Hal Leonard Corporation, {{ISBN|0-7935-7750-0}}, p.194&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1960s, he appeared in films such as ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/79559/It-s-a-Mad-Mad-Mad-Mad-World/ "'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' Listing"] tcm.com, accessed November 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[40 Pounds of Trouble]]'' (1963).&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Bosley.[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B03E1DA173CEF3BBC4C51DFB7668388679EDE "Movie Review:'40 Pounds of Trouble'"] ''The New York Times'', January 24, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; He was featured in [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s last film, the unfinished ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217055/ "'Something's Got to Give' Listing"] imdb.com, accessed November 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1963–1964 television season, he appeared as Harry Grafton, a factory foreman interested in get-rich-quick schemes, much like the previous Bilko character, in CBS's 30-episode ''[[The New Phil Silvers Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Newcomb, Horace.[https://books.google.com/books?id=CFXgj7a55agC&amp;pg=PA1758&amp;dq=Grafton+%22The+New+Phil+Silvers+Show%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Grafton%20%22The%20New%20Phil%20Silvers%20Show%22&amp;f=false "'Phil Silvers Show'"] ''Encyclopedia of Television, Volume 1'' (2004, 2ed.), CRC Press, {{ISBN|1-57958-411-X}}, p. 1758&lt;/ref&gt; with co-stars [[Stafford Repp]], [[Herbie Faye]], [[Buddy Lester]], [[Elena Verdugo]] as his sister, Audrey, and her children, played by [[Ronnie Dapo]] and [[Sandy Descher]]. In 1967, he starred as a guest in one of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Carry On films]], ''[[Follow That Camel]]'', a [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] parody in which he played a variation of the Sergeant Bilko character, Sergeant Nocker.&lt;ref&gt;Munden, Kenneth White.[https://books.google.com/books?id=s1k1RsGvFwwC&amp;pg=PA360&amp;dq=%22Follow+That+Camel%22+%22+Phil+Silvers%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Follow%20That%20Camel%22%20%22%20Phil%20Silvers%22&amp;f=false "'Follow That Camel'"]''The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures'' (1971), University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-20970-2}}, p.360&lt;/ref&gt;
Producer [[Peter Rogers]] employed him to ensure the Carry On films' success in America, though Silvers' presence did not ensure the film's success on either side of the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Childs|first= Peter and Mike Storry|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture]|year=1999|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis| ISBN= 0-415-14726-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iS4hsxKiMNgC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=%22Follow+That+Camel%22+%22+Phil+Silvers%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Follow%20That%20Camel%22%20%22%20Phil%20Silvers%22&amp;f=false 83]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His salary was £30,000, the largest Carry On salary ever, only later met by the appearance of [[Elke Sommer]] in ''[[Carry On Behind]]''.

[[File:Silvers hillbillies 1970.JPG|thumb|170px|Silvers had recurring roles in ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' as Shifty Shafer or "Honest John" in 1969 and 1970.]]
Silvers was offered the leading role of conniving Roman slave Pseudolus in the Broadway musical comedy ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]''. Silvers declined,&lt;ref name=master/&gt; and the role went instead to [[Zero Mostel]], who was so successful in the role that he repeated the role in the 1966 film version. By this time, Silvers realized his error, and agreed to appear in the film as a secondary character, flesh merchant Marcus Lycus. When actor-producer [[Larry Blyden]] mounted a Broadway revival of ''Forum'' in 1972, he wanted Phil Silvers to play the lead, and this time Silvers agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Stanley and Green, Kay.[https://books.google.com/books?id=KDKFHniTy1YC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=%22A+Funny+Thing+Happened%22+%22Phil+Silvers%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20Funny%20Thing%20Happened%22%20%22Phil%20Silvers%22&amp;f=false "'A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'"]''Broadway Musicals, Show by Show'' (1996), Hal Leonard Corporation, {{ISBN|0-7935-7750-0}}, p.198&lt;/ref&gt; The revival was a hit and Silvers became the first leading actor ever to win a [[Tony Award]] in a revival of a musical.

Silvers also guested on ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', and various TV variety shows such as ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'' and ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]''. He appeared as curmudgeonly Hollywood producer Harold Hecuba in the classic 1966 episode "[[The Producer]]" on ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0588103/ "'Gilligan's Island' Episode"] imdb.com, accessed November 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; where he and the castaways performed a musical version of ''[[Hamlet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, Paul A.[https://books.google.com/books?id=A6Qr6BFJUjoC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=%22Gilligan's+Island%22+%22Phil+Silvers%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gilligan's%20Island%22%20%22Phil%20Silvers%22&amp;f=false "The Courage of the Fearless Crew"]''Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization'' (2003), Rowman &amp; Littlefield, {{ISBN|0-7425-0779-3}}, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; (Silvers' production company Gladasya – named after his catchphrase "Gladdaseeya!" – financed the show.)

==Personal life==
Phil Silvers was married twice, to [[Jo-Carroll Dennison]], and to Evelyn Patrick.&lt;ref name=tvgbio&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/phil-silvers/bio/170182 "Phil Silvers: Biography"], [[TV Guide|TVGuide.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; Both of his marriages ended in divorce.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; He had five daughters — Candace, [[Cathy Silvers|Cathy]], Laurie, Nancey&lt;!--sp OK--&gt;, and Tracey Edythe&lt;ref name=tvgbio /&gt; — all by his second wife, Evelyn Patrick.&lt;ref name=master/&gt;

Like his alter-ego Ernie Bilko, Silvers was a compulsive gambler, and also suffered from [[Depression (mood)|chronic depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Maslon, Lawrence and Kantor, Michael.[https://books.google.com/books?id=uV2gZKvQwR0C&amp;pg=PT229&amp;dq=compulsive+gambler+%22+Phil+Silvers%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=compulsive%20gambler%20%22%20Phil%20Silvers%22&amp;f=false "Phil Silvers"]''Make 'em Laugh: The Funny Business of America'' (2008), Hachette Digital, Inc., {{ISBN|0-446-50531-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] in 1962 while performing in Spain. While staying in [[Reno, Nevada]], in the 1950s, he would often gamble all night. On one occasion, at the tiny Cal-Neva Lodge in nearby [[Lake Tahoe, Nevada]], Silvers spent an entire night playing [[craps]] until he lost all his money and then went through $1,000 in credit. A taxi was called to return him to Reno. It was "[o]ne of the worst nights of my life', Silvers told the driver, adding, "Don't wait for any lights and don't wait for any tip . . . I left it at the Cal-Neva!"&lt;ref&gt;Moe, Albert Woods. ''Nevada's Golden Age of Gambling'', Puget Sound Books, (2001), {{ISBN|0-9715019-0-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His memoir is titled ''This Laugh Is On Me''.

==Illness and death==
Silvers suffered a [[stroke]] during the run of ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' in August 1972.&lt;ref&gt;"Phil Silver's Illness Threatens 'Forum' Run", ("Mr. Silvers has been out of the cast since he was stricken a week ago and hospitalized".) ''The New York Times'', August 8, 1972, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; He was left with slurred speech. Despite his poor health, he continued working, playing Harry Starman in the 1974 "Horror in the Heights" episode of ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]'' starring [[Darren McGavin]]. His guest appearances continued into the early 1980s, including co-starring in ''[[The Chicken Chronicles]]'' (1977),&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&amp;dat=19770825&amp;id=-gVZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IVADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5022,1883586 "Phil Silvers Rough Road Back"] ''The Prescott Courier'', August 25, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; an appearance on ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' as an old comic trying to reunite with his old partner, and on ''[[Happy Days]]'' as the father of Jenny Piccolo (played by his real daughter [[Cathy Silvers|Cathy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brant, Marley.[https://books.google.com/books?id=_3XnpqmYAxcC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22Happy+Days%22+%22+Phil+Silvers%22+Piccolo&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Happy%20Days%22%20%22%20Phil%20Silvers%22%20Piccolo&amp;f=false "Jennie Piccolo"]''Happier Days: Paramount Television's Classic Sitcoms 1974-1984'' (2006), Random House Digital, Inc., {{ISBN|0-8230-8933-9}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Silvers played the cab driver Hoppy in [[Neil Simon]]'s send-up of hard-boiled detective films, ''[[The Cheap Detective]]'' (1978), which starred [[Peter Falk]]. In his cab, Silvers can be heard (three words) and seen turning his head towards the camera and breaking into a smile (1/4 fps) at the movie's ending immediately prior to Falk entering "Hoppy's" cab. His final appearance was in an episode of ''[[CHiPs]]'' (entitled "Hot Date") in 1983.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

On November 1, 1985, Silvers died in his sleep in [[Century City, California]]. According to his family, Silvers died of natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Peter. "Phil Silvers, TV'S Sergeant Bilko, Dead At 73", ''The New York Times'', November 2, 1985, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred at [[Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;Farah, Judy.

In 1996, [[TV Guide]] ranked him number 31 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=TV Guide Guide to TV |year=2004 |publisher=Barnes and Noble |isbn=0-7607-5634-1 |pages=596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 poll to find ''The Comedian's Comedian'', Silvers was voted #42 on the list of the top 50 comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders. [[Dick Van Dyke]], who made his TV debut on ''Bilko'', says he "was always fascinated with Phil's sense of timing. Incredible."

Voice actor [[Daws Butler]] employed an [[impressionist (entertainment)|impression]] of Silvers as the voice of the [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon character [[Hokey Wolf]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartoonscrapbook.com/H/hokeywolf1960.htm "Hokey Wolf"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208180953/http://www.cartoonscrapbook.com/H/hokeywolf1960.htm |date=2010-12-08 }} cartoonscrapbook.com, accessed November 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and also used the same voice in numerous cartoons for [[Jay Ward]].{{citation needed |date=January 2011}} The premise of ''The Phil Silvers Show'' was the basis for the Hanna-Barbera cartoon ''[[Top Cat]]'', for which [[Arnold Stang]] moderately imitated Silvers' voice for the title character.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Bruce.[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/arts/television/22stang.html "Arnold Stang, Milquetoast Actor, Dies at 91"]''The New York Times'', December 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 cartoon series ''[[The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' featured a character called Wes Weasley, who had a very similar appearance and voice to Silvers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog?from=Main.AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog "Western Animation: Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"] tvtropes.org, accessed November 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Red Sonja''''' is a 1985 Dutch-American [[sword and sorcery]] [[action film]] directed by [[Richard Fleischer]]. The film introduces [[Brigitte Nielsen]] as the title character with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Sandahl Bergman]], [[Ronald Lacey]], [[Ernie Reyes, Jr.]], [[Paul L. Smith]] and [[Pat Roach]] in supporting roles. The film features the sword-wielding [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Red Sonja]], created by Roy Thomas, who first appeared in Marvel's ''[[Conan (Marvel Comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' series (#23) in 1973. The film's character of Red Sonja was based on Red Sonya of Rogatino, a character created by [[Robert E. Howard]] appearing in his short story "[[The Shadow of the Vulture]]" (1934). The film acknowledges that it was "based on the character created by Robert E. Howard" in the introductory credits.

As in Howard's stories of Conan, the film takes place in the [[Hyborian Age]], a fictional prehistoric time that had been depicted previously in the films ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' and ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]''.

==Plot==

Sonja, a young, red-haired woman, is raped and left for dead by the soldiers of Queen Gedren, a despot who murdered Sonja's parents and brother after she scarred the queen's face in rejection of her sexual advances. Answering her cry for revenge, the red goddess Scáthach appears to her and gives her heightened strength, stamina, agility and fighting skills on the condition that she never lie with a man unless he defeats her in fair combat. She trains under a sword master called "The Grand Master" and is distrustful of all men besides him. At a nearby temple, Varna, Sonja's sister, is a member of an order of priestesses who are preparing to banish a mystical light-powered relic, the Talisman, that created the world and all living things. The Talisman can only be used and touched by women – men vanish if they touch it – and has become too powerful to control. However, Gedren's army and her [[aide-de-camp]] Ikol intervene and slaughter the priestesses and shield maidens before they can imprison it to permanent darkness. 

Varna watches Gedren steal the Talisman before escaping, but is mortally wounded. She is discovered by Kalidor, the Lord of Hyrkania, who goes to find Sonya and bring her back to Varna. Before dying, Varna tells Sonja to find the Talisman and send it into darkness before it ravages the world with storms and earthquakes. Kalidor asks to accompany her, but she rejects the offer. After witnessing the Talisman in use, Sonja arrives to the now-ruined kingdom of Hablock. She meets the young Prince Tarn and his servant Falkon, who say that Gedren used the Talisman to completely decimate Hablock when Tarn refused to surrender. Tarn, demanding vengeance, announces that he will crush Gedren and invites Sonja to work for him as a cook. She politely declines before being told that Gedren is based in Berkubane, the land of Perpetual Night.

Arriving at the mountain gate, Sonja fights Lord Brytag after he refuses her passage for not paying him a 'tender tribute'. When she kills him and takes his key, his troops surround her; Kalidor, who has secretly been following her, attacks their rear, allowing Sonja to escape. Sonja comes across Tarn again, being tortured by bandits. She frees Tarn and kills the bandits with Falkon. They decide to stay together and travel onward toward Berkubane. Gedren's wizard uses a large magic dish to show the approaching party; Gedren recognizes Sonja and orders that she be brought to the fortress unharmed. Using the Talisman to conjure up a storm, she forces Sonja's group to take shelter in a watery cavern where an "Icthyan Killing Machine" is unleashed upon them. Kalidor appears and helps Sonja blind the beast so they can escape.

Sonja accepts Kalidor's company after learning he is a descendant of the lords who entrusted the Talisman to the priestess temple. He flirts with her, so she warns him that "no man can have her" unless he can defeat her in a sword fight. Kalidor challenges her and they fight to a draw. The party arrives at Castle Berkubane and, to protect Tarn, they convince him to stay behind and guard the front entrance. Ikol, realizing Gedren is insane when she refuses his pleas to stop utilizing the unstable relic, plans to escape the castle with bags of Hablock's gold. Sonja confronts Gedren in her council chamber while Kalidor and Falkon deal with her guards in the castle's dining hall. Ikol is stopped by Tarn at the entrance and meets an unpleasant end.

No match for Sonja, Gedren flees to the Chamber of Lights where the Talisman is stored. Now powerful beyond control, the Talisman causes the floor to split open and reveal a chasm of molten lava beneath the castle. Sonja and Gedren duel in the Chamber; Sonja runs Gedren through with her sword, sending the evil ruler plunging into the lava below. Sonja throws the Talisman in after her, destroying it and starting a chain reaction that tears Castle Berkubane apart. The heroes manage to escape as the castle is consumed by the rising volcano. Prince Tarn and Falkon eventually depart to rebuild Hablock while Sonja and Kalidor halfheartedly spar again before kissing.

==Production==
In ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'', [[Sandahl Bergman]] played Valeria, a thief and the love of Conan's life. Bergman was offered the role of Red Sonja, but turned it down, choosing instead to play the villainous Queen Gedren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.filmwerk.co.uk/2011/03/06/comic-book-movies-red-sonja/|title=Comic Book Movies: Red Sonja|publisher=Filmwerk.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Laurentiis met with actress [[Laurene Landon]] and was set to offer her the role of Red Sonja until he discovered she was in an earlier film called ''Hundra''; fearing that it was too similar, de Laurentiis decided not to give her the part. On a 2015 episode of ''[[Real Housewives of Beverly Hills]]'', soap opera actress [[Eileen Davidson]] revealed that she auditioned for the role and was actually runner-up to Brigitte Nielsen. It took Laurentiis almost a year to find an actress "Amazonian" enough to play the title character; he was still looking, eight weeks before the scheduled production, when he saw Brigitte Nielsen on the cover of a fashion magazine. The 21-year-old native of [[Helsingør]], [[Denmark]], in [[Milan]] for a modeling job, soon found herself on a plane heading for Rome and a successful screen test.&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1017352-red_sonja/news/1922674/marvel_movie_madness_part_20_red_sonja/ |title=Marvel Movie Madness! Part 20: Red Sonja |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date=2011-06-23 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George MacDonald Fraser]], who had recently adapted ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' for De Laurentiis, was hired to work on the script during filming.&lt;ref name="fraser"&gt;George MacDonald Fraser, ''The Light's On at Signpost'', HarperCollins 2002 p264-271&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scenes were shot in Italy, around the [[Gran Sasso]] massif ([[Celano]], [[Campo Felice]] and [[Campo Imperatore]]), and in  studios in [[Rome]].

==Music==

The musical score of ''Red Sonja'' was composed and conducted by [[Ennio Morricone]].

==Reception==
The film received generally negative reviews from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maslin |first=Janet |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A02E4D91F39F930A35754C0A963948260 |title=Movie Review - Red Sonja - THE SCREEN: 'RED SONJA' - NYTimes.com |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date=1985-07-03 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a score of 15% based on 27 reviews, with the site's critical consensus stating, "Dull, poorly directed, and badly miscast, ''Red Sonja'' is an uninspired conclusion to Schwarzenegger's barbarian trilogy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1017352-red_sonja/ |title=Red Sonja |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger commented, "It's the worst film I have ever made." He joked, "Now, when my kids get out of line, they're sent to their room and forced to watch ''Red Sonja'' ten times. I never have too much trouble with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/entertainment-starswhoslammovies/3/ |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger: 'Red Sonja' &amp;#124; TheDailyBeast.com: Stars Who Slam Their Movies &amp;#124; Comcast.net |publisher=Xfinity.comcast.net |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Emma |url=http://entertainment.ca.msn.com/movies/galleries/actors-who-hate-their-own-films?page=18 |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger, Red Sonja - Actors who hate their own films |publisher=Entertainment.ca.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Grant (author)|John Grant]], who authored the film's entry in ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'' (1997), gave ''Red Sonja'' a negative review, commenting "Morally dubious (Gedren's [[lesbianism]] is depicted as one of her evil attributes) and worse-acted than words can explain, ''Red Sonja'' is a great embarrassment."&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=John|title=Encyclopedia of Fantasy (1997):  Red Sonja|url=http://sf-encyclopedia.uk/fe.php?nm=red_sonja|website=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Siskel and Ebert]]'' gave the film negative reviews. Both [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] agreed the film was poorly made, but Ebert thought the film contained enough campy humor that he briefly contemplated that ''Red Sonja'' may have been intended as a spoof, with "dialogue that sounds like the actors have already read the ''Mad'' magazine parody of this film."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGHlZM8CJAo&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonard Maltin]] gave the movie 1.5 out of 4 stars and calling it "Spectacularly silly...It might amuse juvenile viewers, but the only real point of interest for adults is deciding who gives the worse performance, Nielsen or Bergman."{{fact|date=December 2016}}

"Phantom of the Movies" [[Joe Kane]] wrote, "An unwise return by Schwarzenegger to his first hit property. Only, instead of sword-and-sorcery, this is 'grunt-and-groan'...he grunts while we groan. Yet it should be noted, in Arn's defense, that he manages to stay off-screen for more than half the movie. Though the fur and heads fly in a few scattered battle scenes, the title character is wooden...and the film itself is clankier than a knight's shining armor."{{fact|date=December 2016}}

==New ''Red Sonja'' adaptation==
A second ''Red Sonja'' film has been in development for some years. In 2008, [[Robert Rodriguez]] and his production company [[Troublemaker Studios]] were working on a version that would have starred [[Rose McGowan]] as the titular character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rose McGowan Explains Why Red Sonja Never Happened |publisher=[[ReelzChannel]] |date= |url=http://www.reelz.com/movie-news/11407/rose-mcgowan-explains-why-red-sonja-never-happened |accessdate=2012-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509175238/http://www.reelz.com/movie-news/11407/rose-mcgowan-explains-why-red-sonja-never-happened/ |archivedate=2012-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009 however, the Rodriguez project had been scrapped, and as of February 2010, rights holders [[Nu Image]] are moving forward with another projected new film, to be directed by [[Simon West]]. Producer [[Avi Lerner]] has said he would like to see [[Amber Heard]] take the role of Sonja, after having worked with her on ''[[Drive Angry]]''. Lerner says the film will shoot before the sequel to ''[[Conan the Barbarian (2011 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=30133|title=Amber Heard For Red Sonja?|work=Empire Online|accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012 at the premiere of ''[[The Expendables 2]]'' West said that the film was stuck in production.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-r8zJIvbr8&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Cosmos has been hired as a screenwriter for the new film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/414439-red-sonja-movie-is-back-on-with-a-new-screenwriter|title=Red Sonja Movie is Back on with a New Screenwriter|work=Coming Soon|date=February 27, 2015|accessdate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2017, Deadline reported that [[Millennium Films]] will finance and produce a new Red Sonja movie with [[Avi Lerner]] and [[Joe Gatta]] producing alongside with [[Cinelou Films]]’ [[Mark Canton]] and [[Courtney Solomon]] and writing by [[Ashley Miller (screenwriter)|Ashley Miller]]..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Busch|first=Anita|url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/millennium-to-remake-female-strong-red-sonja-cinelou-1202201372/|title=Millennium To Produce Female-Strong ‘Red Sonja’ With Cinelou|date=November 4, 2017|accessdate=November 4, 2017|work=Deadline Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Busch|first=Anita|url=https://deadline.com/2018/04/x-men-first-class-thor-writer-ashley-edward-miller-red-sonja-millennium-films-1202358279/|title=‘X-Men: First Class,’ ‘Thor’ Writer Ashley Edward Miller Hired On For ‘Red Sonja’|date=April 4, 2018|accessdate=April 4, 2018|work=Deadline Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, The Hollywood Reporter has reported that the studio are eyeing [[Bryan Singer]] to direct the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siegel|first1=Tatiana|last2=Kit|first2=Borys|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/bryan-singer-talks-direct-red-sonja-1144016|title=Bryan Singer in Talks to Direct 'Red Sonja' for Millennium (Exclusive)|date=September 17, 2018|accessdate=September 17, 2018|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next month in October 2018, Singer is confirmed to direct the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bryan-singer-nabs-huge-payday-directing-red-sonja-1148877|title=Bryan Singer Nabs Huge Payday for Directing 'Red Sonja'|date=October 5, 2018|accessdate=October 5, 2018|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SuperCasino''' was a gambling television channel in the United Kingdom which launched in April 2005 as '''Vegas 24/7''' and was owned by Hi2 Limited, later Vegas 24/7 Broadcasting Ltd and then by NetPlayTV plc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/a20844/vegas-247-makes-epg-debut.html|title=Vegas 24/7 makes EPG debut|date=25 April 2005|last=Shelley|first=Darren|accessdate=1 March 2009|publisher=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; A website [[SuperCasino]] accompanies the TV channel and live feeds of the TV channel are available to view 24/7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bettingpro.com/casinos/Supercasino/ |publisher=Bettingpro.com |title=Super Casino (Netplay Ltd) - Live casino review |deadurl=no |accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting==
SuperCasino currently broadcasts every night of the week on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]. Its presentation is based on the game of roulette, which has two variations, ''[[Live Roulette]]'' and ''Roulette Express''. Live presenter led programming is available from 18:00 to 04:00 daily and has automated roulette during 04:00 and 18:00 on the Sky channel. Viewers can register and play along via their telephone, on the website or through their smartphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supercasino.com/mobile|title=SuperCasino FAQ|publisher=SuperCasino|date=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Super Casino was removed from [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] channel 39 on 20 October 2009 and [[Freesat]] channel 851 on 28 July 2010. However, it is shown overnight on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and sister channel Channel 5 + 1 between 00:00 and 04:00 every morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2008/12/15/afx5820284.html|title=NetPlay gets licence to operate Freeview channel|date=15 December 2008|accessdate=1 March 2009|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is broadcast live from studios in London, with additional broadcast facilities in Guernsey, CI. It was removed from Sky channel 862 on 2 March 2016.

SuperCasino was the first casino operator to have a live TV roulette channel in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Live TV Roulette Story|url=http://www.supercasino.com/blog/the-tv-roulette-story|publisher=SuperCasino|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses only accredited roulette wheels in line with e-gambling license.

==Live Roulette==
Live Roulette is the name given to the presenter led [[roulette]] offering. Presenters 'host' the show and every few minutes a new roulette round is played and viewers/players can watch the [[croupier]] spin the ball around the roulette wheel. As soon as the ball is in motion the table is 'closed' for betting and no more bets can be placed. This format has remained unchanged for many years.

==Roulette Express Premium==
During the hours of 4am-6pm when presenter/spinner led ''[[Live Roulette]]'' isn't being broadcast there is a simpler Autowheel game, named Roulette Express Premium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = SuperCasino Show Times|url = https://oddsjunkie.com/review/super-casino#Super_Casino_TV_Schedule|publisher = OddsJunkie.com|accessdate = 20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An automated roulette wheel using jets of compressed air to move the ball automatically is used as the main gaming device and each roulette round is shorter in duration than the presenter led show.

It features a variety of narrated true crime stories intertwined with interviews with criminals, witnesses, victims, authors, 911 call audio, witness testimony, trial audio, interrogation tapes, music, and sound effects. The podcast was first released on January 1, 2014 by creator, host, Mike Boudet.

Within a year, ''Sword and Scale'' had 1 million downloads and it has ranked in the top 10 of the [[iTunes]] "Science" category, and within the top 5 in the "Social Sciences" category. Popularity increased&lt;ref name="=&amp;quot;RollingStone&amp;quot;"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/beyond-serial-10-true-crime-podcasts-you-need-to-follow-w429955/sword-and-scale-w429957 |title=Beyond 'Serial': 10 True Crime Podcasts You Need to Follow |date=July 22, 2016 |accessdate=July 22, 2016 |work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; dramatically after the popularity of [[Serial (podcast)|''Serial'']],&lt;ref name="Mash"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2014/11/13/podcasts-detective/ |title=7 podcasts for your inner detective |date=November 3, 2014 |accessdate=November 3, 2014 |work=[[Mashable]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the show is often compared to it and other podcasts like [[Criminal (podcast)|Criminal]].&lt;ref name="Crim"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://podcastpals.net/cast-off-criminal-versus-sword-and-scale/ |title=Cast-Off!

==Controversies==
Mike Boudet had allegedly made requests in the past for nude photos from female fans of the podcast, and  allegedly sent aggressive tweets to family members who contacted him about using a 911 phone call by a 14-year-old  when the 14-year-old's father killed his mother. The call was used in its entirety on the show, with no approval given from the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mamamia.com.au/mike-boudet-sword-and-scale | title=After some revolting comments, people are boycotting one of the most popular podcasts| date=April 6, 2018|work=mamamia.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mighty Boosh Live: Future Sailors Tour''''' was a stage-show written and performed by [[Noel Fielding]] and [[Julian Barratt]], also known as [[The Mighty Boosh]]. [[Michael Fielding]], [[Rich Fulcher]] and [[Dave Brown (comedian)|Dave Brown]] also performed in the show, along with the Boosh Band.

The show toured the UK and Ireland from September 2008 through to January 2009.

==Act I==
The show begins with [[Vince Noir]] (Fielding) and [[Howard Moon]] (Barratt) performing "Future Sailors" – Noir entering the stage in a large pirate ship, Moon following in a rubber dinghy. The first act of the show features a series of sketches starring a number of different characters.  [[Bob Fossil]] (Fulcher) is introduced, and guides the audience through a series of moves from his Dance Academy. [[Naboo the Enigma|Naboo]] ([[Michael Fielding|M. Fielding]]) and [[Bollo (character)|Bollo]] ([[Dave Brown (comedian)|Brown]]) follow this, Naboo now a gangsta rapper in Los Angeles, and Bollo shows off his latest invention – the frisbee clock.

After this, [[The Moon (The Mighty Boosh character)|The Moon]] makes his first appearance; [[Tony Harrison (Mighty Boosh)|Tony Harrison]] introduces his own chat-show themed 'nugget' of the show, including a set from a Lithuanian taxi-driver turned stand up comic Kraków ([[Rich Fulcher|Fulcher]]), and [[The Crack Fox]] tells a cautionary tale about a party lifestyle and subsequent drug use.  When he leaves, [[The Hitcher (character)|The Hitcher]] is introduced, leading the Boosh Band on a performance of [[Eels (The Mighty Boosh)|Eels]].

==Act II==
The second act of the show revolves around a play written by Howard Moon about the end of the world, entitled ''No Future?''  Moon has enlisted the help of Naboo, Fossil, Bollo and Vince to perform the play, but Noir is quick to point out its ridiculous content, and hijacks the play by blackmailing Howard about a jazz-porn photo shoot he mistakenly got roped into.

At Vince's insistence, the cast (now with Brown out of the Bollo costume again) perform his play about aliens from the planet [[Camden Town|Camden]]. Vince plays ''Sunflash'' (who speaks with a Chinese/Chav accent, which Vince believes people will speak in the future) and Fossil as ''Booblay'' (a future pleasure-robot). Sunflash transforms the mutants from Moon's play into beautiful versions of themselves, thanks to his sponsor Jean-Claude Jacquetti.  The increasingly humiliated Howard is made to wear a silver corset and blonde pigtails, and together with Dave Brown's Mutant character, performs the ''Mutants'' song from the first series.

Moon tries to halt the play and leave the theatre, but is lured back in with a crimp.  The Boosh Band reappears and together with Vince, Howard, Naboo, Bollo and Bob Fossil, they perform a medley of crimps from the series.  During this, the [[Honey Monster]] appears, and the gang use Vince's giant Jean-Claude Jacquetti hairdryer to decapitate him and stick his head on a spike: a reference to a [[Sugar Puffs]] advertisement which they believed had plagiarised their 'crimping' style earlier that year. The band perform the song "[[Nanageddon (song)|Nanageddon]]" to end the show, sometimes followed by performances of "[[Journey to the Centre of Punk|I Did A Shit On Your Mum]]" and "[[Charlie (The Mighty Boosh)|Charlie]]".

==Early versions and changes==
The previews and early performances were introduced by stage manager Bob Fossil, who would run through a series of safety features with the audience, before the "Future Sailors" number, but this was soon dropped.  Over time, many sections become elongated – during the November shows, Bollo's frisbee clock joke was built upon greatly, for example.

Some parts of the show were dropped altogether – previews included prototype versions of [[The Crack Fox]] sketches, but were replaced on the early tour dates by a sequence involving [[Rudi van DiSarzio|Rudi]], who would then join The Hitcher during the performance of [[Eels (The Mighty Boosh)|Eels]].  Also, early performances featured the Bingo Caller from [[Nanageddon]] instead of Eleanor.

For the DVD recording nights at [[Manchester Apollo]] on 3 and 4 December, The Moon's reworking of the [[Jay-Z]] track, ''[[99 Problems]]'', was removed due to copyright clearance, but it has been performed on almost every other night of the tour (apart from one of the early Glasgow shows where the Moon did not appear due to technical issues), including the other shows that week.  Eleanor also switched from throwing her usual ballpit-style balls into the audience during the bingo section, instead throwing and kicking giant, numbered, inflatable balls into the crowds – on the DVD filming nights, these were also signed by the cast.

Some sections change simply because of either audience participation, or due to mistakes on the night.  Bollo tripping over the globe, for example, was added after Dave Brown slipped several times in early October, and by the end of the month it was a regular part of the performance.  Similarly, Tony Harrison slipping in his chair, and the following dialogue, was added after Noel Fielding found it increasingly difficult to stay upright in such an enclosed space.

There have been rare performances of ''Love Games'' from [[The Legend of Old Gregg|The Legend of Old Gregg]] during the final band set.

==DVD==
''Boosh Live: Future Sailors Tour'' was released on DVD on 16 November 2009 with special and limited edition copies of the DVD being made available at the same time. Recorded at the Manchester Apollo on 3rd and 4th December, the DVD features the full show with commentary. The Special and Limited Editions also contain a bonus disc with backstage clips and scenes from ''Journey of the Childmen'', a documentary about the Future Sailors Tour. ''Journey of the Childmen'' was shown at film festivals and received a full DVD release in 2010.

The 'Normal Edition' includes the 2008/9 Live Show.
The 'Special Edition' includes the 2008/9 Live Show, the 2006 Live Show, and a set of Boosh ''Outrage'' playing cards in the style of [[Top Trumps]].

The 'Limited Edition' includes the 2008/9 Live Show, the 2006 Live Show, a set of Boosh playing cards, and a Boosh belt buckle.

'''''The X-Files Mythology – Volume 3''''' collection is the third DVD release containing selected episodes from the [[The X-Files (season 3)|fifth]] to the [[The X-Files (season 8)|eighth]] seasons of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. The episodes collected in the release form the middle of the series' [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]], and are centered on [[Colonist (The X-Files)|alien]] colonization efforts, the fall of the [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|Syndicate]], and [[Fox Mulder]]'s ([[David Duchovny]]) abduction.

The collection contains three episodes from the fifth season, five from the [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth]], six from the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh]], and two from the eighth. The episodes follow the investigations of paranormal-related cases, or [[X-File]]s, by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agents Fox Mulder and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]). Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. Events covered in the episodes include the discovery of alien-human hybrid [[Cassandra Spender]] ([[Veronica Cartwright]]), the destruction of the Syndicate; the discovery of the remains of a spaceship in Africa; the fate of Mulder's sister, Samantha; and the abduction of the former, as well as the subsequent hunt for him under the direction of [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]).

The collection features the closure of several long-running arcs, as well as new introductions to the series' mythology. Series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] felt that the series' ongoing storylines were becoming too confusing, so he scrapped them and started over. Released on September 27, 2005, the collection generally received mixed to positive reviews from critics. [[William B. Davis]], [[Mitch Pileggi]], [[Nicholas Lea]] and [[Laurie Holden]] all play supporting roles in the collection.

==Plot summary==
The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. Mulder is a former believer in the paranormal—having lost his belief in the [[The X-Files (season 5)|fifth season]] opener "[[Redux (The X-Files)|Redux]]", while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. As a [[Colonist (The X-Files)|rebel alien race]] secretly attacks several groups of former [[Alien abduction|alien abductees]], the agents meet [[Cassandra Spender]] ([[Veronica Cartwright]]), a woman who claims to be a multiple abductee and wants to deliver a positive message about aliens.&lt;ref name="patientxplottv"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Patient X (The X-Files) | title=Patient X | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Kim Manners]] (Director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] and [[Frank Spotnitz]] (Writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 5 | number = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=patientx&gt;Meisler, pp 173–184&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Mulder has Scully put under hypnosis to learn the truth about her abduction after Cassandra goes missing and her son, [[Jeffrey Spender]] ([[Chris Owens (actor)|Chris Owens]]), angrily attempts to push his way up in the FBI.

In Washington, D.C., Mulder appears before an FBI panel regarding his [[The X-Files (film)|experiences in Antarctica]], but is later denied reassignment to the X-Files division: Mulder and Scully have been replaced by Spender and [[Diana Fowley]] ([[Mimi Rogers]]).&lt;ref name="TheBeginning"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The Beginning (The X-Files) | title=The Beginning | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Kim Manners]] (Director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (Writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 6 | number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="begplot"&gt;Meisler, pp. 11–18&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Walter Skinner|Skinner]] is mysteriously poisoned by a nanorobot infection.

==Background==
[[File:SpotnitzandCarter-cropped.jpg|Spotnitz (''left'') and Carter (''right''), the main writers for the show's mythology episodes.|200px|thumb|left]]
From the [[The X-Files (season 3)|third season]] to the sixth season, the mysterious Syndicate was explored in detail. In the two part episode "[[Two Fathers]]"/"[[One Son]]", the Syndicate was destroyed. The plan to eliminate the Syndicate and relaunch the series' mythology in a new direction was originally conceived in September 1998.&lt;ref name="offprod"&gt;Meisler, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Kim Manners]] stated "I've said for years that the show really resolved itself, if you will, by accident. The whole storyline of the Syndicate and the bees and the aliens and the chips in the neck, they all seemed to just accidentally fall into place and create an intriguing, mysterious storyline that eventually got so mysterious and so intriguing that Chris had to blow it up, because he couldn't deal with it anymore."&lt;ref name="prodcompxf"&gt;Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Biogenesis (The X-Files)|Biogenesis]]"/"[[The Sixth Extinction (The X-Files)|The Sixth Extinction]]"/"[[The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati|Amor Fati]]" trio of episodes started a [[Mythology of The X-Files|new mythology]] for the series, questioning the origin of human life. Series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] claimed to be interested in the subject for a while, citing the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement in great extinctions that had happened millions of years ago.&lt;ref name="offprod2"&gt;Meisler, pp. 290–291&lt;/ref&gt; Carter claimed that early in the show he had met with a man who was one of the people responsible for leading the project of mapping the human genome and that he was interested enough in the subject to tie it into the show's alien mythology.&lt;ref name="alienastro"&gt;Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific basis for extraterrestrials pursued the writers to help Mulder an Scully's beliefs come together, which was furthered in the [[List of The X-Files episodes|later seasons]] of the show.&lt;ref name="offprod2" /&gt; [[Frank Spotnitz]] claimed that the ideas used in this episode had been discussed between him and Carter for a few years, and had become easier to bring up after clearing away elements of the conspiracy in the episodes "Two Fathers" and "One Son".&lt;ref name="offprod2" /&gt;

"Closure" was written to create an end to Mulder's quest for his sister, Samantha, who had been abducted when he was a child. The idea to close the story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members. However, many of the show's producers realized that the time had come to answer one of the show's biggest questions. Spotnitz explained that, "I think [series star, David Duchovny] grew tired of playing the man who is missing his sister. [...] I told him, 'This is going to be the last time you're going to have to play [that part].'"&lt;ref name="s139"/&gt; Paul Rabwin noted that, "It's been seven years. I don't think any of us are going to miss Samantha Mulder. That device and motivation were very strong in the early years of the show. But as the years have gone by, the speculation kind of melted away."&lt;ref name="s139"&gt;Shapiro, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

"Requiem" was written as a way to potentially end the series. While filming was underway for the seventh season, many members of the crew felt that the show had entered into its final season. Executive producer [[Frank Spotnitz]] later explained, "There was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show that it was time to call it a day."&lt;ref name="bigbook"&gt;Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, it was decided that Mulder would be abducted at the end of the seventh season, leaving things open for the actor's return in 11 episodes the following year.&lt;ref name=space&gt;{{cite web|author=Elber, Lynn |url=http://space.com/sciencefiction/tv/xfiles_duchovny_000518_wg.html |title=Fox Mulder 'Ready to Get Back to Work' |publisher=SPACE.com |date=18 May 2000 |accessdate=4 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041210113058/http://space.com/sciencefiction/tv/xfiles_duchovny_000518_wg.html |archivedate=December 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually replaced Duchovny's Mulder with Robert Patrick's John Doggett.&lt;ref name=doggettjohn&gt;{{cite web |author=Fleming, Michael |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117784003.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1&amp;query=john+doggett |title=Patrick marks 'X-Files' spot |work=Variety  | date = 20 July 2000 | accessdate =4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critical reception to the release ranged from mixed to positive. Monica S. Kuebler from ''[[Exclaim]]'' magazine noted that, while the set was "only for diehards, completists", the compilation was "the strongest of the mythology boxes thus far [released]". She went on to name the "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"Amor Fati" arc the "best" of the set.&lt;ref name=exclaim&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuebler|first=Monica|title=The X-Files Colonization|journal=[[Exclaim!]]|date=October 2005|url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/Dvd/x-files_colonization-x-files|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey Robinson from [[DVD Talk]], was more critical, however. He wrote that, although the story was "interesting, intriguing, and entertaining", the selection of episodes "does not offer the same level of excitement" when compared to the previous two volumes.&lt;ref name=dvdtalk/&gt; He concluded by commenting that there is "enough entertainment value for you to enjoy".&lt;ref name=dvdtalk&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Jeffrey|title=The X-Files Mythology, Vol. 3 – Colonization|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/18852/x-files-mythology-vol-3-colonization-the/|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]|accessdate=21 June 2012|date=27 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Uhlich from ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' awarded the box set three-and-a-half stars out of five. He commented on the conclusion of many of the show's long-running arcs, and noted that Mulder was often only a witness to these events, such as the destruction of the Syndicate and the death of his sister. Of the latter, Uhlich wrote that he "waver[s] back and forth on how emotionally effective it is".&lt;ref name=slant/&gt; He did, however, award the image quality of the DVDs four stars out of five and refer to their presentation as "excellent".&lt;ref name=slant&gt;{{cite web|last=Uhlich|first=Keith|title=The X-Files Mythology: Colonization|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/the-x-files-mythology-colonization/757|publisher=''[[Slant (magazine)|Slant]]''|accessdate=21 June 2012|date=25 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ronald Reagan televised address from the Oval Office, outlining plan for Tax Reduction Legislation July 1981.jpg|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan]]'s economic policies, which were dubbed "[[Reaganomics]]", included large tax cuts and were characterized as trickle-down economics—in this picture, he is outlining his plan for Tax Reduction Legislation from the [[Oval Office]] in a televised address, July 1981]]
'''Trickle-down economics''', also called '''trickle-down theory''', refers to the economic proposition that taxes on businesses and the wealthy in society should be reduced as a means to stimulate business investment in the short term and benefit society at large in the long term. In recent history, the term has been used by critics of [[Supply-side economics|supply-side economic]] policies, such as "[[Reaganomics]]." Whereas general supply-side theory favors lowering taxes overall, trickle-down theory more specifically targets taxes on the upper end of the [[Social class|economic spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Why Trickle Down Economic Works in Theory But Not in Fact|author=Amadeo, Kimberly|date=April 29, 2017|magazine=The Balance|url=https://www.thebalance.com/trickle-down-economics-theory-effect-does-it-work-3305572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cross and Reaganomics: Conservative Christians Defending Ronald Reagan|author=Crouse, Eric R.|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-vkVdJPN4wC|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "trickle-down" originated as a joke by humorist [[Will Rogers]] and today is often used to criticize economic policies which favor the wealthy or privileged while being framed as good for the average citizen. [[David Stockman]], who as [[Ronald Reagan]]'s budget director championed [[Reagan tax cuts|Reagan's tax cuts]] at first, later became critical of them and told journalist [[William Greider]] that "supply-side economics" is the trickle-down idea:&lt;ref name=atlantic-stockman&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1981/12/the-education-of-david-stockman/305760/?single_page=true "The Education of David Stockman"] by William Greider&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Greider. ''The Education of David Stockman.'' {{ISBN|0-525-48010-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|It's kind of hard to sell 'trickle down,' so the supply-side formula was the only way to get a tax policy that was really 'trickle down.' Supply-side is 'trickle-down' theory.|David Stockman|''[[The Atlantic]]''}}

Political opponents of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] soon seized on this language in an effort to brand the administration as caring only about the wealthy.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Multiple studies have found a correlation between trickle-down economics and reduced growth.&lt;ref name=imf/&gt;&lt;ref name=pav/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/business/12scene.html|title=In the Real World of Work and Wages, Trickle-Down Theories Don’t Hold Up|date=April 12, 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tjn/&gt; Trickle-down economics has been widely criticised particularly by [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] ([[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Social liberalism|social liberal]]) and [[moderate]] politicians and economists, but also some [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] ([[conservative]]) politicians.

== History and usage ==
[[File:WilliamJBryan1902.png|thumb|150px|[[William Jennings Bryan]], who criticized trickle-down theory in his [[Cross of Gold speech]] in 1896]]
In 1896, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[List of United States presidential candidates|presidential candidate]] [[William Jennings Bryan]] described the concept using the metaphor of a "leak" in his {{nowrap|[[Cross of Gold speech]]:&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas Frederick. 1992. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VIAbb1cKqp4C&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq= The Power "to Coin" Money: The Exercise of Monetary Powers by the Congress]''. Armonk, N.Y.: M.E.

:There are two ideas of government. There are those who believe that if you just legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous, that their prosperity will leak through on those below. The Democratic idea has been that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous their prosperity will find its way up and through every class that rests upon it.&lt;ref name="historymatters.gmu.edu"&gt;[http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5354/ Bryan's "Cross of Gold" Speech: Mesmerizing the Masses], historymatters.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Humorist Will Rogers jokingly advised in a column in 1932:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiredpen.com/2015/01/30/will-rogers-trickle-economics/|title=Will Rogers on "trickle up" economics|date=2015-01-30|website=WiredPen|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;This election was lost four and six years ago, not this year. They [Republicans] didn’t start thinking of the old common fellow till just as they started out on the election tour. The money was all appropriated for the top in the hopes that it would trickle down to the needy. Mr. Hoover was an engineer. He knew that water trickles down. Put it uphill and let it go and it will reach the driest little spot. But he didn’t know that money trickled up. Give it to the people at the bottom and the people at the top will have it before night, anyhow. But it will at least have passed through the poor fellows hands. They saved the big banks, but the little ones went up the flue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William J. Bennett]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Humorist Will Rogers referred to the theory that cutting taxes for higher earners and businesses was a "trickle down" policy, a term that has stuck over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, William J. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=PLP5U-M8dhoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=rosenman+the+belief+that+prosperity+would+trickle+down+to+the+bottom+of+the+heap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigkbm_2eTQAhUCq1QKHS_GAvwQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=trickle&amp;f=false ''America: The Last Best Hope'']. Harper Collins. p. 78. {{ISBN|1595551115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Presidential speech writer [[Samuel Rosenman]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The philosophy that had prevailed in Washington since 1921, that the object of government was to provide prosperity for those who lived and worked at the top of the economic pyramid, in the belief that prosperity would trickle down to the bottom of the heap and benefit all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'' notes that the first known use of "trickle-down" as an adjective meaning "relating to or working on the principle of trickle-down theory" was in 1944&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trickle-down ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'' (online edition) entry for "trickle-down."] Accessed September 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; while the first known use of "trickle-down theory" was in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trickle-down%20theory ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'' (online edition) entry for "trickle-down theory."] Accessed September 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the [[President of the United States|presidency]], Democrat [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] alleged "[[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] [...] simply don't know how to manage the economy. They're so busy operating the trickle-down theory, giving the richest corporations the biggest break, that the whole thing goes to hell in a handbasket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/73jul/janos.htm|title=The Last Days of the President|first=Leo|last=Janos|work=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking on the [[United States Senate|Senate]] floor in 1992, Senator [[Hank Brown]] (R-Colorado) said: "Mr. President, the trickle-down theory attributed to the Republican Party has never been articulated by President Reagan and has never been articulated by [[George H. W. Bush|President Bush]] and has never been advocated by either one of them. One might argue whether trickle down makes any sense or not. To attribute to people who have advocated the opposite in policies is not only inaccurate but poisons the debate on public issues".&lt;ref&gt;Hank Brown. ''[[Congressional Record]],'' March 24, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Thomas Sowell]] has written extensively on trickle-down economics and loathes its characterization, citing that supply-side economics has never claimed to work in a "trickle-down" fashion. Rather, the economic theory of reducing marginal tax rates works in precisely the opposite direction: "Workers are always paid first and then profits flow upward later – if at all".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsowell.com/images/Hoover%20Proof.pdf "Tricle Down" Theory and "Tax Cuts for the Rich"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
The economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] noted that "trickle-down economics" had been tried before in the United States in the 1890s under the name "horse and sparrow theory", writing: {{quote|Mr. [[David Stockman]] has said that [[supply-side economics]] was merely a cover for the trickle-down approach to economic policy—what an older and less elegant generation called the horse-and-sparrow theory: 'If you feed the horse enough oats, some will pass through to the road for the sparrows.'|sign=|source=}} Galbraith claimed that the horse and sparrow theory was partly to blame for the [[Panic of 1896]].&lt;ref name=galbraith&gt;Galbraith, John Kenneth (February 4, 1982) "[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1982/feb/04/recession-economics/ Recession Economics]."

In the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]], [[Independent politician|independent]] candidate [[Ross Perot]] called trickle-down economics "political voodoo".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1992/trickle-down|title=The Living Room Candidate - Commercials - 1992 - Trickle Down|website=www.livingroomcandidate.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same election during a presidential town hall debate, [[Bill Clinton]] said: {{quote|What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of [declining economic conditions in America].

In New Zealand, [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] [[Member of Parliament (New Zealand)|Member of Parliament]] [[Damien O'Connor]] has called trickle-down economics "the rich pissing on the poor" in the Labour Party campaign launch video for the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/5870477/Labour-campaign-video-harks-back-to-history|title=Labour campaign video harks back to history|last=Chapman|first=Kate|date=October 28, 2011|work=Stuff.co.nz|language=English|access-date=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study by the [[Tax Justice Network]] indicates that wealth of the super-rich does not trickle down to improve the economy, but it instead tends to be amassed and sheltered in [[tax haven]]s with a negative effect on the tax bases of the home economy.&lt;ref name=tjn&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/21/offshore-wealth-global-economy-tax-havens| author=Heather Stewart |title=Wealth doesn't trickle down – it just floods offshore, research reveals| work=[[The Guardian]] |date=July 21, 2012 |accessdate=August 6, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Pope Francis]] referred to "trickle-down theories" in his [[apostolic exhortation]] ''[[Evangelii Gaudium]]'' with the following statement (No. 54): {{quote|Some people continue to defend trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world.

A 2015 paper by researchers for the [[International Monetary Fund]] argues that there is no trickle-down effect as the rich get richer: &lt;blockquote&gt;[I]f the income share of the top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. In contrast, an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with higher GDP growth.&lt;ref name=imf&gt;Era Dabla-Norris; Kalpana Kochhar; Nujin Suphaphiphat; Frantisek Ricka; Evridiki Tsounta (June 15, 2015).

Retrieved June 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2015 report on policy by economist [[Pavlina R. Tcherneva]] described the failings of increasing economic gains of the rich without commensurate participation by the working and middle classes, referring to the problematic policies as "Reagan-style trickle-down economics," and "a trickle-down, financial-sector-driven policy regime".&lt;ref name=pav&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tcherneva|first1=Pavlina|title=When a Rising Tide Sinks Most Boats: Trends in US Income Inequality|url=http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/pn_15_4.pdf|website=Levy Economics Institute|publisher=Bard College|accessdate=November 25, 2016|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential candidates]] debate, [[Hillary Clinton]] accused [[Donald Trump]] of supporting the "most extreme" version of trickle-down economics with his tax plan, calling it "trumped-up trickle-down" as a pun on his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/26/clinton-trump-would-cut-taxes-for-the-rich-in-trump-dump-economics.html| author=Jacob Pramuk |title=Clinton: Trump would cut taxes for the rich in 'trumped up' trickle down economics| work=[[CNBC]] |date=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tru''''' is a 1989 play by [[Jay Presson Allen]], adapted from the words and works of [[Truman Capote]].

==Background==
Adapted from the words and works of [[Truman Capote]], ''Tru'' is set in the writer's [[New York City]] apartment at 870 United Nations Plaza the week before Christmas 1975. An excerpt from Capote's infamous unfinished [[roman à clef]], ''[[Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel|Answered Prayers]]'', recently has been published in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''. Having recognized thinly veiled versions of themselves, [[Manhattan]] [[socialites]] such as [[Babe Paley]] and [[Slim Keith]] turn their backs on the man they once considered a close confidant. Alone and lonely, Capote — soothing himself with pills, vodka, cocaine, and chocolate truffles — muses about his checkered life and career in what is essentially a two-act [[monodrama]].

There is one [[anachronism]] in the script. At one point Capote, talking about [[suicide]], states he has stashed enough pills to stage his own [[Jonestown Massacre]]. The Jonestown Massacre did not occur until 1978, three years after the period portrayed in ''Tru''.

==Production==
After 11 previews, the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway production]] of ''Tru'', directed by Allen, opened on December 14, 1989 at the [[Booth Theatre]], where it ran for 297 performances. [[Robert Morse]] starred as Truman Capote.

In his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Frank Rich]] said, "Intentionally or not, ''Tru'' is a creep show: a hybrid of [[necrophilia]] and tame fan-magazine journalism that doesn't so much rekindle fascination with a troubled writer as reawaken the willies prompted by those disoriented talk-show appearances … that were the desperate final act of his career."

&lt;blockquote&gt;In place of a life portrait with depth, ''Tru'' settles for its wind-up [[Madame Tussauds|Mme. Tussaud]]'s caricature of the wrecked 1975 model Capote. This Tru is sporadically funny — if one shares Mrs. Allen's taste for the campiest of anecdotes and one-liners — and rarely boring. But since the soul of the younger Capote doesn't shine through as Mr. Morse's youthful spirit does, the potentially touching drama of decay is lost. The complex, possibly tragic figure of a wasted artist is replaced by a maudlin, some might say antediluvian, stereotype of ''[[The Boys in the Band (play)|Boys in the Band]]'' vintage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?_r=2&amp;res=950DEED81131F936A25751C1A96F948260 ''The New York Times'', December 15, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1992, Morse recreated his performance for the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''[[American Playhouse]]''.

Morse also directed a production of the play in [[Toronto]] in 1996, starring Canadian actor [[Louis Negin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/31503-Toronto-Tru-Delays-Opening "Toronto Tru Delays Opening"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022031813/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/31503-Toronto-Tru-Delays-Opening |date=2012-10-22 }}. ''[[Playbill]]'', May 23, 2996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accolades==
[[Robert Morse]] won the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play]] and the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show]].

For his performance in the 1992 ''[[American Playhouse]]'' presentation of ''Tru'', Morse won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor – Miniseries or a Movie|Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie]].

The '''Yilan International Children's Folklore and Folkgame Festival''' ('''YICFFF'''; {{zh|c=宜蘭國際童玩藝術節}}) is an artistic festival in [[Taiwan]], which has taken place during the summer vacation each year at the [[Dongshan River Water Park]] in [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan County]] since 1996.

*The festival was canceled in 2003 due to the outbreak of [[SARS]].
*Completion of the [[Hsuehshan Tunnel]] in 2006 made going to the YICFFF more convenient.
*The government of [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan]] announced the festival's cancellation in 2007.
*The festival will be held again from July 3 to August 15 in 2010 as the [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]] has again taken over the position as the government of Yilan since 2009.

==Closing down==
[[Yilan County Government]] announced on 8 August 2007 YICFFF would no longer be held due to a substantial loss of visitors and funds. This marked the end of the YICFFF, 12 years after it began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2007/08/08/117436/Yilan-festival.htm Yilan festival will be the last]'', China Post, 8-8, 2007''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Save YICFFF actions===
The news about YICFFF's official cancellation drew objections from many people including the people in [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan]] in the tourism industry as well as the citizens of Yilan in general{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. YICFFF will be held again in 2010 as the [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]] has again taken over the position as the government of Yilan since 2009.

==Restorative==
Since Yilan residence have not been able to consistently support this event due to political change and conflict, the party has made changes to eliminate the possibility of any further interruptions.

This Yilan International Children's Folklore and Folkgame Festival was restored in 2010 as new magistrate [[Lin Tsung-hsien]] was elected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4202">'''Zan Ganassa''' {{IPA-it|ˈdzaŋ ɡaˈnassa|}} (c. 1540 – c. 1584) was the stage name of an early actor-manager of [[Commedia dell'arte]], whose company was one of the first to tour outside [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=SenelickA&gt;Senelick 1995a, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; Ganassa's real name was probably '''Alberto Naseli'''&lt;ref name=Hartnoll&gt;Hartnoll 1983, "Ganassa, Zan" pp. 313–314.&lt;/ref&gt; (also spelled '''Naselli''').&lt;ref name=SenelickA/&gt;

He was known for playing ''[[zanni]]'', comic servant roles,&lt;ref name=SenelickA/&gt; hence his stage name, and is one of the first actors believed to have played the ''zanni'' subtype known as [[Harlequin]] (''Arlecchino'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]), which subsequently became one of the most important leading roles in Commedia dell'arte plays.&lt;ref&gt;Senelick 1995b, p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganassa is first mentioned in 1568 as the leader of a troupe in [[Mantua]].&lt;ref name=SenelickA/&gt; After his troupe had performed in Paris in 1571, they were invited by [[Charles IX of France]] to take part of the festivities surrounding the marriage of the King of Navarre (later [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]) to Charles's sister [[Marguerite de Valois]] in August 1572.&lt;ref name=Hartnoll/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baschet 1882, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rd5LAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA24 pp. 24–26].&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1574 to 1584 Ganassa performed in [[Spain]] during the reign of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip I]][[Philip II of Spain|I]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; where he exerted considerable influence on early Spanish professional theatre. He was so popular that the authorities in [[Seville]] withdrew the troupe's license: workers were neglecting their jobs in order to see the plays. Ganassa is mentioned numerous times by [[Lope de Vega]], who may have based his comic servant ''[[gracioso]]'' on Commedia dell'arte types. The ''gracioso'' later became a stock character of [[Comedia (Spanish play)|Spanish comedia]].&lt;ref name=SenelickA/&gt;

During this time period, it was common for theatre companies to setup their stages right before a performance and take down everything immediately after. Ganassa recognized what a burden this would be and donated to the city of [[Madrid]] to create a theatre known as ''Corral de la Pacheca'', which is the first ever permanent theatre in the city of Madrid. Ganassa guaranteed himself tenancy in this theatre by a 9-10 year lease from its owner, [[Isabel Pacheco]], by persuading the ''Cofrades.'' Ganassa also donated again to the Cofrades in 1582 to help build the second permanent theatre space of Madrid, the ''[[Corral del Príncipe|Corral de Principe]].''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shergold|first=N.
