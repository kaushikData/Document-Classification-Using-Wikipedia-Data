'''A. N. Krishna Rao''' ('''Arakalagudu Narasingarao Krishna Rao'''; 9 May 1908&amp;nbsp;– 8 July 1971), popularly known as '''Anakru''', was an Indian writer. He is one of the best-known writers in the [[Kannada]] language and was popularly known as ''Kadambari Sarvabhouma'' (''lit'', "King of Novels"). The inception of the ''Pragatishila'' ("progressive") movement in [[Kannada literature]] is credited to him. He received an honorary doctorate from the [[Mysore University]] and the Karnataka state Sahitya Akademi award.

==Life==
Anakru was born on 9 May 1908 in [[Kolar]] town in the state of [[Karnataka]], [[India]]&lt;ref name="tha1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thatskannada.oneindia.mobi/column/enguru/2008/43386.html|title=Remembering ANaKru on his birth centenary|work=ThatsKannada.com|accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Narasinga Rao (father) and Annapoornamma (mother). The family traces its roots to [[Arkalgud]] town in the [[Hassan district]] of [[Karnataka]]. At the start of his career, he edited literary Kannada magazines such ''Katha Manjari'' and ''Vishva Vani''.&lt;ref name="dh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Nov42008/spectrum2008110398607.asp |title=Remembering A na kru |work=[[Deccan Herald]] |date=4 November 2008 |accessdate=22 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916032852/http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Nov42008/spectrum2008110398607.asp |archivedate=16 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an editor of the [[Kannada Sahitya Parishath]]'s publication  ''Kannada Nudi'' ("Kannada speech"). Anakru was nominated as the president of 42nd [[Kannada Sahitya Sammelana]] held in [[Manipal]].&lt;ref name="dh"/&gt; He is known for his passion for his native language Kannada. Once when introducing Anakru to an audience, [[Masti Venkatesh Iyengar]], one of Kannada's most well-known writers said "I am a Tamil Kannadiga, [[Sir Mirza Ismail]] is a Muslim Kannadiga, and Anakru is a pure Kannadiga". This tribute from the likes of Masti mirrors the Kannada fervour Anakru was known for.

Anakru fought for the unification of [[Kannada]] speaking regions, when Kannada speakers were spread across different provinces in [[British India]]. He started a movement to promote and popularize Kannada. He openly criticized people in authority who neglected Kannada. In one such case, he wrote an article in the ''Kannada Nudi''', criticizing the [[Hindi]] oriented policies of R. R. Divakar (the first governor of Bihar), the President of [[Kannada Sahitya Sammelana]] in 1929. On being asked to apologize, Anakru resigned from the post of the editor.&lt;ref name="tha1"/&gt; Anakru lived most of his life in his house (called ''Annapoorna'') in Vishveshpuram, a suburb in South [[Bangalore]].&lt;ref name="dh"/&gt; He died on 8 July 1971 at the age of 63.

==Literature==
Starting with his first novel, ''Jeevanayathre'' ("Journey of life"), Anakru wrote for about 40 years and authored more than a hundred novels.&lt;ref name="dh"/&gt; He was a prolific writer and his literary output exceeded eighty thousand pages. When he started writing, the ''Navodaya'' form of [[Kannada literature]] was in vogue. He rejected this form because he felt such writings were a creation of aesthetes and did not reflect the disturbing realities of life.&lt;ref name="bk"&gt;P. K. Rajan (1989), p112&lt;/ref&gt; He came up with themes that formed a new movement in itself, called ''[[Pragatishila]]'' ("progressive"). Anakru saw literature as an instrument of social change. Influenced by Anakru, other promising writers such as [[Ta Ra Su]] (T.R. Subba Rao), Basavaraj Kattimani and Anupama Niranjana wrote novels that belonged to the ''Pragatishila'' genre.&lt;ref name="bk"/&gt;

Not known to follow the beaten track, Anakru penned three novels, ''Nagna Sathya'', ''Shani Santaana'' and ''Sanje Gaththalu'', with themes dwelling on the topic of prostitution for which he was criticized for depicting vulgarity in these novels.&lt;ref name="bk1"&gt;Sisir Kumar Das (1995), p404, 405&lt;/ref&gt; To defend his theme, Anakru wrote in his work ''Sahitya mattu kama prachodane'' ("Literature and the propagation of lust"): "If telling the truth is vulgar, then I am a vulgar writer. If the act of covering with a cloth, a downtrodden helpless naked woman on the street is vulgar, then I am a vulgar writer".&lt;ref name="bk1"/&gt; His non-moralistic approach to writing and extensive usage of dialogue contributed to vast readership.&lt;ref name="bk2"/&gt;

His magnum opus novel Natasarvabhowma runs for 750 pages, delves into the dire state of Kannada drama world, during the early 20th century. He provides the details about what was ailing the Kannada drama companies and provides valuable suggestions on their improvement. The novel covers the life of fictitious stage actor Rajacharaya, his struggle to establish as an actor and then to run the drama company as its proprietor. This novel was first published in 1940 and was way ahead of its time. The novel was criticized for celebrating the extramarital affairs of Rajacharya. However out of 750 pages hardly 3-4 pages covers this and the rest wonderfully depicts the do good nature of Rajachraya, where he donates majority of his earnings to charity. Krishna Raos love for the Kannada culture, its people and his quest to see the Kannada speaking areas integrated comes out clearly. He severely criticizes the language bigotry and tries to convey that all languages are great through Rajacharya.

Anakru wrote many novels where the protagonist was an artist. These novels follow a plot which narrates the story of a gifted musician who becomes famous, only to succumb to the charms of a woman. This leads to his subsequent failure as his commitment on the art deteriorates. At the end, the artist either overcomes this to regain his touch or succumbs completely to passion leading to his eventual failure.&lt;ref name="bk6"&gt;C.N. Ramachandran, Si. En Rāmacandran (2001), p55&lt;/ref&gt; One of Anakru's most popular novels ''Sandhyaraaga'' belonged to this theme and narrates of the life of a dedicated musician while contrasting him with his mean brother.&lt;ref name="bk2"&gt;K. M. George (1992), p182&lt;/ref&gt;  a Kannada movie based on this novel in 1966 received critical acclaim. Other notable novels written by Anakru with on theme are the ''Mia Malhar'', ''Udayaraga'', ''Sahitya Ratna'' and ''Vijayanagara Samrajya (11 novels)''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3987">'''AppLocale''' is a tool for [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] by [[Microsoft]]. It is a launcher application that makes it possible to run non-[[Unicode]] ([[Windows code page|code page]]-based) applications in a [[locale (computer software)|locale]] of the user's choice. Since changing the locale normally requires a restart of Windows, AppLocale is especially popular with western users of Asian applications. The program installs itself in a subfolder of the Windows directory called "AppPatch", and when launched prompts the user for an executable to run and the desired codepage. It can also create a shortcut in the start menu, located under Microsoft AppLocale, however you will be prompted by AppLocale before the program's launch.

AppLocale works with many, but not all non-Unicode applications, and as such is still inferior to really setting the particular locale systemwide. In particular, it requires [[font]]s for the particular locale to be installed on the system it runs on, and Administrator privileges to be installed (though not to be used). It is not officially supported for use with Windows Vista or Windows 7; a person who is using Vista or 7 must either alter the system locale manually, or use an available unofficial workaround to install the AppLocale utility (see below).

AppLocale is not included in normal retail versions of Windows, but is available for free download from Microsoft's website.

==Bugs==

===Compatibility===
Running AppLocale on [[Windows Vista]] or [[Windows 7]] is not officially supported and it fails to install on default configurations of these OS if attempted; however there is a [http://www.mydigitallife.info/workaround-to-install-microsoft-applocale-utility-in-windows-vista/ workaround to install it] (which requires starting apploc.msi file from command prompt under administrative privileges). This workaround also works for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. However, it no longer works on [[Windows 10]].

AppLocale cannot run on [[Windows 2000]] platforms.

In September 2016, Microsoft removed all pages referring to Applocale, including the official download, from the Microsoft website, thereby officially discontinuing all support (since it was only ever supported officially on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003). However, it can still be retrieved from the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/6/8/568a8caf-29c4-43ec-a10f-97730f26977e/apploc.msi |title=applocale.msi - direct download link. |publisher=Internet Archive |accessdate=May 19, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110171635/http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/6/8/568a8caf-29c4-43ec-a10f-97730f26977e/apploc.msi |archivedate=January 10, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mojibake issue===
AppLoc.tmp in the AppPatch folder (''%windir%\apppatch'') causes a [[Mojibake]] issue of [[Windows Installer]]. Unofficial solutions of this problems include a modified version of the program, called '''pAppLocale''' provided by Hung-Te Lin (林弘德 ''piaip'') for free,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntu.csie.org/~piaip/ piaip]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntu.csie.org/~piaip/papploc.msi pAppLocale]&lt;/ref&gt; or blanking the ''AppLoc.tmp'' file, then setting it to [[file system permissions|read only]].

'''Augustus Caesar Buell''' (September 4, 1847 – May 23, 1904) was an American [[author]] who wrote several biographies of great Americans, following the success of a book about his experiences in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Most material in these biographies that was not plagiarized was (as was discovered too late for many subsequent scholars) fabricated.

In 1876 he was briefly arrested following an accusation of libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Augustus C. Buell |vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court=[[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] |date=1876 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lvk7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=%22Augustus+C.+Buell%22 |quote= |accessdate=2008-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Buell's own statements about his life and ancestry are not to be trusted. From his claims to have ancestors who were personally acquainted with the subjects of his biographies, down to the simple thanks he gave to the [[Library of Congress]] (which, according to the visitors' log, he never entered) he told the stories his audience wanted to hear.

He was born in 1847, and raised in [[New York City]], he is known to have enlisted in Company L of the 20th New York Cavalry, on August 21, 1863. He was promoted to corporal three months later, but demoted again the following April, and he left the service in July 1865. He later claimed to have risen to the rank of colonel.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Col. Augustus C. Buell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1904/05/24/archives/death-list-of-a-day-col-augustus-c-buell.html  |quote=Col. Augustus C. Buell, a veteran of the civil war and later widely known as a war correspondent and author of a standard "Life of John Paul ... |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 24, 1904 |accessdate=2010-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For some years he lived in New York State, but his literary career began some time after he had moved to [[Philadelphia]], to work for the major shipbuilding and engineering firm of [[William Cramp &amp; Sons]].

In his Civil War memoir, "The Cannoneer", published in 1890, he vividly described his experiences at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], but that battle took place in July 1863, seven weeks before he enlisted, and two essays by Silas Felton reveal much of the hollow truth behind Buell's claims. He later claimed that a visit to [[St. Petersburg]] in Russia on behalf of Cramp's, a few years later, enabled him to find important material for his first biographical project, the life of [[John Paul Jones]]. The major demolition job on that work we owe to the far superior scholarship of Admiral [[Samuel Eliot Morison]], who devoted an appendix to Buell's lies about Jones in his own [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]-winning biography. The work of scholars like Morison, which should never have been necessary, reveals the full depth of Buell's fraud. Had he simply introduced false stories without citing any source document, there would have been less of a problem, but he went one step further, and invented entire letters and journals, from which he published extracts in the book.

He died in 1904, and is buried at the [[Mount Moriah Cemetery (Philadelphia)|Mount Moriah Cemetery]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Legacy==
Milton Hamilton, editor of the papers of colonial administrator [[Sir William Johnson]], had to do the same sort of research as Morison to uncover the truth behind Buell's 1903 production. Two further biographies, of [[William Penn]] and [[Andrew Jackson]], were published in the months following Buell's death, by which time suspicions of his work were already growing rapidly. His last posthumous work may be his most truthful, the memoirs of his boss, Charles H. Cramp. About the same time as this was published, Mrs. Reginald de Koven produced the first detailed analysis of the fraudulent Buell technique, specifically his John Paul Jones biography.

Despite the suspicions, in 1905 a superb quotation from John Paul Jones was copied from Buell's biography for "Reef Points", the handbook of the [[United States Naval Academy|Brigade of Midshipmen]]. It was pretty much all Buell's invention, based only loosely on genuine Jones material, as was his explanation of the context of Jones's famous quotation "I have not yet begun to fight", but in both cases the lie achieved immortality because it was superior to the truth (and although Jones's reputation as "Father of the [[U.S. Navy]]" is largely based on Buell's fabrications, that does not mean it is entirely undeserved). The list of later biographies that innocently quoted Buell's invented primary source documents would make a substantial Wikipedia article by itself.

'''Birendra Kumar Bhuyan''' (Odia:ବିରେନ୍ଦ୍ର କୁମIର ଭୁୟାଁ) was a famous writer, poet and lyricist in the literature world of [[Odisha]], India.

Birendra has contributed to Odia literature by writing several national award-winning books and songs in Odisha.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== Early life ==

Birendra Kumar Bhuyan was born on 25-July-1933 to Balaram Bhuyan and Sulochana Devi in Nilapada, a small village on the bank of the Birupa, a tributary of the river of [[Mahanadi]] in that time Jajpur a sub-division in the district of [[Cuttack]].   He was a very hard working person from his childhood and grew up having a dream in his eyes to do something for his state and the people of Odisha. During his time there was no connectivity of road to his village, and due to lack of funds, he was unable to cross the river by boat so he would swim across the river to go to school. But there was an incident which changed his life. When Birendra was 13 years old, his Father died due to some health issue. His mother was his prime inspiration. After that Birendra stayed in his maternal uncle's house to complete his schooling{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}. But after his father's death he couldn't concentrate on studies and left home. He went to [[Varanasi|Kashi]], [[Brindavan]] and [[Mathura]] in order to become a monk. In Mathura he came across a Monk whose advice changed his mind and gave new focus towards life. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} He came back and completed his matriculation from Indupur High School. He had completed his bachelors and Masters after that.  He had seen a dream to serve the poor people of Odisha which motivated him to join the Government of Odisha service in the field of administration.

== Career ==

He started writing from 1951 and had shown his excellence in the field of Odia Literature in just 40 years i.e. till 1991.He was noted primarily as a major writer in Oriya, for his understanding of rural and ethnic myths and situations, especially on village life of Odisha, original imagery, humanistic outlook, his command over Oriya diction and idiom. His main area of focus was children's literature. He had written many popular Odia songs out of which in 1965 "Eka K eKa", "Joutuka Deiparibini", Jataka Padichhi Raja Jataka","Kalasha Upare Amba Dalia Gori Kanyaku Bara Kalia"which were sung by many famous singers of Odisha like [[Akshaya Mohanty]], [[Bhikari Bal]], and Mohammed Sikander Alam.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}Many of his compositions had already been broadcast from Akashvani Cuttack.

He had written many books and had won several state and national awards for his work.He was also a lyricist in [[Akashvani (radio broadcaster)|All India Radio]], [[Cuttack]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}.His book "Lakhmi Nandan" for neo literates was awarded with the [[27th National Award]] by [[Human Resource Development Department]] of [[Government of India]].For his contributions towards Odia Children Literature, he was awarded [[Mina Bazar]] Award by [[Prajatantra Prachar Samiti]] founded by [[Dr.Harekrushna Mahatab]].
   
Apart from literature world he also had proven himself as a strict Administrative Officer. His first posting was in [[Talcher]] where he worked in Adult Education department of Govt.Of India. He also had worked in different places e.g. Raruan, Narasighpur, Kendrapada, [[Cuttack]], Nilagiri, Kamakhya Nagar, Dhenkanal, Tureikela, [[Talcher]], Korei, Suanpatna, Kendujhar and Kotagada. He had done many significant jobs for the people of Odisha during his tenure in various parts of Odisha he was posted. He couldn't complete his service and died just before his retirement from service on 19-June-1991 at the age of 57 years.

== Family ==

[[File:Sushila_Devi.jpg|thumb|right|Sushila Devi with Gandhi during Freedom Fight of India]]
He was married to Shubhashini Bhuyan in 1956. He has two sons, Subhendra and Satyendra and three daughters, Jayasri, Gitisri and Padmasri. His Aunt Sushila Devi popularly known as Singha Jhia Sushila (Daughter of Leo) was a freedom fighter during the [[Indian independence movement]] and was a follower of [[Mohandas Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]].

In [[viticulture]], the '''[[Canopy (biology)|canopy]]''' of a [[Vitis|grapevine]] includes the parts of the vine visible aboveground - the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]], [[canopy (vine)#Cordon|cordon]], [[Plant stem|stem]]s, [[Leaf|leaves]], [[flowers]], and [[grape|fruit]]. The canopy plays a key role in light energy capture via [[photosynthesis]], water use as regulated by [[transpiration]], and [[microclimate (wine)|microclimate]] of ripening grapes.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, R., and M. Robinson. 1991. ''Sunlight Into Wine; A Handbook for Wine Grape Canopy Arrangement''. WineTitles, Adelaide. {{ISBN|978-1-875130-10-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Glossary of viticultural terms#Canopy management|Canopy management]] is an important aspect of viticulture due to its effect on grape [[yield (wine)|yield]]s, quality, [[Vigor (disambiguation)|vigor]], and the prevention of [[grape disease]]s. Various viticulture problems, such as uneven grape ripening, sunburn, and frost damage, can be addressed by skillful canopy management.&lt;ref&gt;Skelton, S. 2007. ''Viticuluture: An Introduction to Commercial Grape Growing for Wine Production''. Lulu.com. {{ISBN|0-9514703-1-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9514703-1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, S.B., D.C. Luth, and B. Guerra. 2003.  Potential solar radiation in a VSP trellis at 38°N latitude.  ''Practical Winery and Vineyard'' 25:16-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[pruning]] and leaf trim, the canopy is often [[vine training|trained]] on [[trellis (architecture)|trellis]] systems to guide its growth and assist in access for ongoing management and harvest.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 134-135"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 134-135 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vine==
[[File:Guyot g1.jpg|left|thumb|The trunk of a grape vine trained along wires with one cordon extending horizontally to the left.]]
The vine is the main part of the grapevine, extending from the [[root system]] in the ground up to the cordons, or arms, of the vine. When the grape is young the trunk is very [[pliable]] and must be supported by stakes as part of a vine training system. The height of the trunk varies depending on [[grape variety]] and the type of trellis system being used and can range from 4&amp;nbsp;inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm) to 30 feet (10 m). During winter [[dormancy]], the trunk can be vulnerable to extreme freezing conditions and will be sometimes buried and insulated with soil to protect it.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 714"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 714 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trunk is composed of sleeves of conductive [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], most notably the [[phloem]] and [[xylem]]. The outside [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of the vine contains the phloem tissues which transports [[sap]], enriched by [[sugar]]s and other molecules, from the leaves to the rest of the vine. During the [[annual growth cycle of the grapevine]], the vine will start to store [[carbohydrate]] energy in the wood part of the trunk and roots. The downward passage of phloem sap to the roots and this storing process can be interrupted by the viticultural practice of "girdling" or [[cincturing]] the vine. This process can improve [[fruit set]] by forcing the vine to direct most of its energy towards developing the grape clusters. The xylem is the woody tissue on the inside of the trunk that moves sap, enriched with [[water]], [[mineral]]s and other compounds, up from the roots to the leaves.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 714"/&gt;

===Cordon===
The cordon, or "arms", of the grapevine extend from the trunk and are the part where additional arms and eventually leaves and grape clusters extend. The cordons are usually trained along wires as part of a trellis system. This training usually fixes the cordon into a permanent position, such as horizontal extending from the trunk in opposite directions.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 199"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 199 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stem==
[[File:Wine grapes08.jpg|right|thumb|During veraison, when the grapes change color, the shoots of the vine start to harden and brown.]]
The terms stem, stalks and [[shoot]]s are sometimes used interchangeably but viticulturalists generally make some differentiation. The stem of the grapevine item, extending from cordon, is considered the shoot and this part is most often pruned in the process of "shoot thinning" to control grape yields. The stalk extending out to hold the grape cluster is known as the [[bunchstem]] while the stem of the individual grape berry is the [[pedicel (botany)|pedicel]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 663"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 663 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shoot of the vine develops from new [[bud]]s located on the cordon and grow to include the leaves, [[tendril]]s and eventually grape clusters. Shoots first begin to appear in spring, following [[bud break]], accelerating growth till the [[flowering]] stage and usually slowly by the time that the vine begins [[veraison]]. During the stage of veraison (typically mid to late summer), the shoot starts to harden and change color from green to brown. 

===Cane===
The shoot is ripening at this point and becomes known as a "cane." In wintertime, the canes of the grapevine are usually completely cut off with the amount and weight of the cane being used to gauge the amount of pruning and canopy management that will be needed for the upcoming year. The "tip" of the shoot is the small (0.4 in/1&amp;nbsp;cm) part of the shoot furthermost from the vine. Viticulturalist use the growth of this tip as an indication of vine vigor because the tip competes with the grape clusters for resources from the vine. Ideally, shoot growth should come to a stop around the time of veraison; a vine that continues growing the shoots will stand the chance of less fully developed grape clusters.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 627-628"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 627-628 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leaves ==
[[File:Chardonnay leaf with naked vein highlighted.JPG|left|thumb|Ampelographers would be able to identify this [[Chardonnay]] leaf based on the size and shape of its five lobes and the naked veins around its sinus.(highlighted in box)]]
A grapevine's leaves are the most visible part of the canopy and also one of the most important. It is through the leaves that the vital [[physiological]] process of [[photosynthesis]] takes places which creates the carbohydrates that the vine needs to grow and process grape clusters. The size of the leaves vary due to grape varieties with varieties like [[Merlot]] having very large leaves and [[Gewürztraminer]] noted for having small leaves. The typical size is normally comparable to that of a human hand. In addition to size, there are many of other unique characteristics to the leaves that [[ampelographer]]s use for plant identification. The size and shape of the leaf's [[Sinus (botany)|sinus]] (the opening space where the [[Leaf#Divisions of the lamina (blade)|blade of the leaf]] connects to the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]), the shape of the "teeth" along the outer edge, the arrangement of the five [[Lobe (anatomy)|lobes]] or projecting parts and the angle and length of the [[Leaf#Veins|veins]] can all assist in identifying the grapevine.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 396-397"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 396-397 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The color of the leaf can be an indication of the health and nutrition of the vine. [[Chlorophyll]] in the leaf gives it a natural greenish color. Prior to the winter dormancy, the vine will stop being photosynthetically active which will contribute to a natural break down of chlorophyll and changing of color. However, deficiency in [[nitrogen]] or [[sulfur]] could cause the vine to turn prematurely (such as before [[harvest (wine)|harvest]]) yellow. The appearance of reddish spots of brown "dead zones" could be the sign of a viral infection (such as the [[leafroll virus]]) or contamination through the use of [[herbicide]]s.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 396-397"/&gt;

Viticulturalist will use a [[leaf to fruit ratio]] as a guideline in determining a vine's ability to fully ripen grapes. Quite different from the consideration of yields, the balance of leaf cover (needed for photosynthesis) and proportion of fruit (judged by weight rather than number of clusters) could have the most substantial effect on the quality of the grape for [[winemaking]]. Pioneered by viticulturalist [[Richard Smart (viticulturalist)|Richard Smart]], the idea of maintaining a "balanced vine" is to have just enough leaf cover for the plant to produce the energy needed to ripen the grape without having too much photosynthetic activity to where the vines has a surplus of energy and continues growing more shoots. Additionally, leaves provide shade to the grape clusters which be beneficial in protecting the clusters from the harshness of heat stress ("sunburn") but excessive shade can also decrease the development of [[sugar]]s, [[anthocyanin]]s and other [[natural phenol in grape|phenolic]]s and other important compounds in the grape. Many vineyards employ the practice of leaf removal throughout the growing season to try to maintain optimal leaf coverage.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 396-397"/&gt;

'''Blessed Carlo Gnocchi''' (25 October 1902{{spaced ndash}}28 February 1956) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]], educator and writer. He is [[veneration|venerated]] as a [[beatification|blessed]] by the [[Catholic Church]].

During [[World War II]], he was a [[military chaplain]] of the [[Alpini]], the elite mountain warfare soldiers of the [[Italian Army]], and after the tragic experience of the war, he strove to ease the wounds of suffering and misery created by the war.

[[File:Don Gnocchi giovane.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Picture of young don Gnocchi]]
Gnocchi was born in [[San Colombano al Lambro]], a few miles from [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]], to Enrico Gnocchi and Clementina Pasta, a seamstress.&lt;ref&gt;''Father Gnocchi. A life spent for the others'' edition San Paolo pg 66&lt;/ref&gt;  The youngest of three brothers, when he was age five, he lost his father in 1907, from [[silicosis]], caused by the unhealthy job as a [[marble|marble worker]].

After moving to [[Milan]] with family, he lost his two older brothers in a few years{{spaced ndash}}Mario, in 1908, and Andrea, in 1915, from [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://salute24.ilsole24ore.com/bioetica/diritti_del_malato/1464_Don_Gnocchi_sara_beato:la_Fondazione_in_festaper_il__papa_dei_mutilatini_.php|title=ilsole24ore.com|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in a very devout and fervent environment, in the village of [[Besana in Brianza|Montesiro]] in [[Brianza]], where he often went to his relatives because of poor health. There, he was approached by Father Luigi Ghezzi, who helped him in his choice to enter [[seminary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dongnocchi.it/html/interv01/interv003.htm dongnocchi.it] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216100750/http://www.dongnocchi.it/html/interv01/interv003.htm |date=February 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his [[Holy Orders]] as priest in 1925 from [[Archbishop of Milan]] [[Eugenio Tosi]], and the same year he celebrated his first Mass in Montesiro.

==Educator==
{{quote|"How nice it is to play in the snow when it is clean and white. Jesus also likes to play with the souls of the children when they are white and clean, but if they get spoiled, Jesus doesn't like them any more..."|Carlo Gnocchi &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dongnocchi.it/doncarlo/biograf/biog2.htm Biography of Father Gnocchi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512212532/http://www.dongnocchi.it/doncarlo/biograf/biog2.htm |date=May 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Gnocchi's first passion, since the first years of his priesthood, was the upbringing and education of the youth, by getting them closer to the Church and the [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]].

First, he was entrusted to the parish of [[Cernusco sul Naviglio]] and then in 1926, the densely populated [[San Pietro in Sala]] of Milan, he continued his vocation for years, creating a deep bond with his parishioners.

His fame as an educator came to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Archbishop of Milan]], [[Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster]] who, in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;Information on page 54 of "Famiglia Cristiana" n°43 del 25-10-2008&lt;/ref&gt; appointed him as spiritual director of the [[Gonzaga Institute of the Brothers of Christian Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gonzaga-milano.it/sito/news.php?page=3&amp;categoria=istituto|title=Tutte le News - Page 4 - Istituto Gonzaga|website=www.gonzaga-milano.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The war==
{{quote|"I can say to have finally seen the man in those fatal days. The naked man, completely stripped, because of the violence of the events so much bigger than him, from any restraint and convention, in complete mercy of the most basic instincts emerged from the depths of being."|Carlo Gnocchi, "Cristo con gli Alpini"}}
[[File:Reverberi don gnocchi.jpg|thumb|220px|Father Gnocchi in departure for the Russian front, in the company of general Luigi Reverberi]]
At the end of the 1930s, Gnocchi was named chaplain of the second legion of Milan, composed of students of the [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore]] and the Gonzaga Institute. His mother, to whom he was very attached, died in 1939. At the start of World War II, Gnocchi volunteered in the ''Val Tagliamento'' battalion of the Alpini, sent to the [[Greece|Greek]]&amp;ndash;[[Albania]]n front. After the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]] in 1941, in 1942 Gnocchi left for the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian front]] as chaplain of the [[2nd Alpine Division Tridentina]], where he participated in the [[Battle of Nikolayevka]]. During the dire retreat in the Russian [[steppe]], he nearly fell victim to the freezing cold: dazed by [[frostbite]], he would certainly have met the fate of thousands of other Italian servicemen, had not [[medical officer]] Rolando Prada (an offspring of the [[Prada|famous leather-working family]]) recognized him and put him on a passing military sled.&lt;ref&gt;"Rolando Prada in Russia salvò la vita a un santo", ''Corriere della Sera'', 22 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving the conflict, he gathered last wishes of the wounded, that he would bring back to Italy, in a journey all over the country, as a messenger for the families of the deceased. He went into the [[Alpine Valleys]] to find the relatives of fallen comrades. After becoming part of the O.S.C.A.R., Catholic association for aid to refugees, he helped Jews and escaped Allied POWs flee to [[Switzerland]]. He wrote articles in the illegal magazine ''Il Ribelle'' (''Rebel'') and in the diocesan newspaper ''L'Italia'' (''Italy''). He was imprisoned more than once in the San Vittore prison, but obtained the liberation by the intervention of the archbishop of Milan, [[Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster]]. In those years the idea arose to create a charitable center that would take care of the victims of this war, which in the future developed as the origin of the ''Pro Juventute''.

==Postwar period==
After the war, Gnocchi felt as his duty to aid that part of childhood that had been affected by the war the most. First, he directed his charitable work to the orphans of [[Alpini]], housing them in Istituto Arosio (Institute Arosio) and subsequently devoted himself to the "mutilated" and to children invalids of war and civilians, establishing for them a vast network of colleges in many cities of Italy ([[Inverigo]], [[Parma]], [[Pessano con Bornago]], [[Torino]], [[Rome]], [[Salerno]], [[Milan]], [[Florence|Firenze]], [[Genova]], ...); and, in the end, opened the doors of modern ''Centri di rieducazione'' ("Re-educations centers") for children affected by [[Poliomyelitis|polio]]. For this forsaken and handicapped children, to whom he had devoted all of his young life, Gnocchi dedicated one of his most significant writings: ''Pedagogia del dolore innocente'' (''Pedagogy of Innocent Suffering'').

==Juvenile Foundation==
{{quote|"A dream, after the war, to be able to devote myself to a work of charity, whatever it is, or better the one that God would want from me."|father Carlo Gnocchi}}
[[File:Don Gnocchi mutilatini.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Father Gnocchi in the company of mutilated children]]
The dramatic experience of the retreat from Russia, lived as [[military ordinariate]] always on the front, matured in Gnocchi the idea and the focus of his charitable mission; assisting the victims of war, in search of redemption for their "innocent suffering". In 1945, he was nominated as director of the ''Istituto Grandi Invalidi'' (Institute of Registered Invalids) of [[Arosio]], thus accepting the first orphans and adults disabled by the war. In 1948, he founded the "Fondazione Pro Infanzia Mutilata" ("Foundation For Mutilated Infants"), acknowledged in the next year with a decree by the [[President of Italy]]. The same year, the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]] [[Alcide De Gasperi]] nominated Gnocchi as adviser to the Presidency of the Council for the mutilated by the war. In 1951, the foundation was dissolved, and all its goods and structure were donated to the newly created ''Fondazione Pro Juventute'' (Juvenile Foundation).

[[File:Funerali Don Gnocchi.jpg|thumb|Procession of the [[Alpini|Alpines]] and "mutilated" at the funeral of Father Gnocchi]]
He died in Milan, age 53, with a [[crucifix]] in his hands, given to him by his mother years before, and very beloved in his last hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dongnocchi.it/html/beatificazione/Tra%20le%20mani%20di%20don%20Carlo%20il%20crocifisso%20della%20mamma.pdf "Mother's crucifix in hands of don Gnocchi"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[metastasis]] of the tumor that had stricken him had reached the skeleton and the respiratory system. Three crises that occurred between noon and the evening before had announced the fourth, fatal, and no one had delusions about his possible recovery anymore: Don Gnocchi's constitution had been too hardly tested and accompanied by suffering and fasting, as well as by the unrelenting advancing of the illness, even though his face, often smiling, deceived visitors. While dying, he donated his [[cornea]]s to two blind children, guests of his foundations, ''Silvio Coangrande'' and ''Amabile Battistello''.

==Long road to beatification==

[[File:Francobollo Carlo Gnocchi.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Stamp posted in memory of the 100th anniversary of Gnocchi's birth]]
After his death, there were many people and the believers who called for his help, say they received ''graces'' by the priest. On 17 August 1979, an ''Alpino'', a specialist electrician by profession, from [[Villa d'Adda]], survived a serious accident at work. The [[miracle]] is attributed to Gnocchi, invoked by the victim. For these reasons, thirty years after his death, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|archbishop of Milan]] [[Carlo Maria Martini]] established the ''Processo sulla vita, virtù e fama di santità'' (''Process on the life, virtues and reputation for holiness'') (Diocesan process) on 6 May 1987, that was concluded positively on 23 February 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dongnocchi.it/html/beatificazione/Un%20esame%20lungo%2022%20anni%20-%20le%20tappe%20del%20rigoroso%20processo.pdf Text of the canonization process]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} initiated by [[Carlo Maria Martini]], 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; In 199 sessions was held deposition of 178 texts and numerous documentation that was collected. This investigation material (for a total of 4321 pages) was presented to the Congregazione per le Cause dei Santi di Roma (Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome), where Brother Leo Luigi Morelli was appointed postulator of the cause of canonization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ana.it/index.php?module=ContentExpress&amp;func=display&amp;ceid=291&amp;meid= Associazione Nazionale Alpini] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027082321/http://www.ana.it/index.php?module=ContentExpress&amp;func=display&amp;ceid=291&amp;meid= |date=October 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March 2009, cardinal [[Dionigi Tettamanzi]] announced the beatification for the 25 October 2009; the rite for beatification was presided by the archbishop of Milan, cardinal [[Dionigi Tettamanzi]] in the presence of many ambrosian priests and bishops. Among these were the cardinal Prefect of the Congregation of Bishops [[Giovanni Battista Re]], the former Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations Msgr. [[Piero Marini]] and the Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]], bishop [[Angelo Amato]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgiornale.it/a.pic1?ID=332750 the newspaper "Father Gnocchi beatified on October 25"].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cauque Mayan''' is a [[mixed language]], a [[K'iche' language|K’iche’]] (Quiché) base relexified by [[Kaqchikel language|Kaqchikel]] (Cakchiquel). During the colonial era, K’iche’ migrated to [[Sacatepéquez Department|Sacatepéquez]], in the heart of Kaqchikel territory, where they founded the village of Santa María Cauque. Today only older adults retain the K’iche’ base to their speech: for younger speakers, the language has merged into Kaqchikel.

==(to merge)==
The Kaqchikel-K'iche' Mixed Language is also known as the Cauqué Mixed Language, or Cauqué Mayan, spoken in the aldea of Santa María Cauqué, Santiago Sacatepéquez, Department of Sacatepéquez in Guatemala. A 1998 study by the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) estimated speaker population at 2,000.&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"&gt;"Kaqchikel-K'iche' Mixed Language." Lewis, M. Paul, Gary F. Simons, and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). 2016. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Nineteenth edition. Dallas, Texas: SIL International. Web. https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ckz.&lt;/ref&gt; While the language's grammatical base is from K’iche’, its lexicon is supplied by Kaqchikel. It is generally thought that in the 15th century during the colonial period, its original K’iche’ speakers came from the area of what is now the Department of Quiché and founded Santa María Cauqué. Currently, the aldea is west of Guatemala City and at least 100 miles from the nearest K’iche’-speaking region.&lt;ref name="Romero, Sergio Francisco 2006"&gt;Romero, Sergio Francisco. 2006. Sociolinguistic Variation and Linguistic History in Mayan: The Case of K’ichee’ (Doctoral dissertation).

Guatemala: Instituto Lingüístico de Verano de Centroamérica.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, it is clear that a variety of the original K’iche’ language was brought into and has continued to manifest in the grammar of this Kaqchikel-K'iche' Mixed Language, while it demonstrates the result of relexification over time from the surrounding Kaqchikel language. This particular process of relexification of the original K'iche' that had emigrated to a predominantly Kaqchikel-speaking region probably began with borrowing from the contact language (Kaqchikel) of roots and content morphemes, such as nouns and verbs.&lt;ref name="Bakker, Peter 1994. pp. 41-52"&gt;Bakker, Peter &amp; Pieter Muysken. 1994. “Mixed languages and language intertwining.” Pidgins and Creoles: An introduction. Jacques Arends, Pieter Muysken, &amp; Norval Smith (eds.). Amsterdam, The Netherlands: John Benjamins Publishing Company, pp. 41-52.&lt;/ref&gt; This heavy lexical influence is understood to have been a significant deviation in "content" words from those that were part of the original Joyabaj dialect of K'iche' to their current Kaqchikel counterparts in the Kaqchikel-K'iche' Mixed Language, while at the same time there has been no structural borrowing from the surrounding Kaqchikel to replace the grammar that appears to have originated from K'iche'.&lt;ref name="Romero, Sergio Francisco 2006"/&gt;

According to a preliminary phonological analysis by Paul S. Stevenson,&lt;ref name="Stevenson, Paul S 1990"/&gt; the speech of those from Santa María Cauqué came from an original variety of K'iche', which now acts as the mixed language’s grammatical base. This evidence is realized in K’iche’ morphological-syntactic elements surrounding Kaqchikel vocabulary. This includes verb inflection for present tense-aspect marker, from which the K’iche’ prefix //k-// is implemented, contrasted with the more typical Kaqchikel prefixes of //y-// and //n-//. Furthermore, Santa María Cauqué  utilizes K’iche’ suffixes at the end of a phrase that indicate whether the verb was transitive or intransitive, //-o//~//-u// or //-ik// respectively, those which Kaqchikel does not.&lt;ref name="Stevenson, Paul S 1990"/&gt; In fact, the //-ik// suffix can also be found with positionals in Santa María Cauqué.&lt;ref&gt;Majzul, Filiberto Patal, Lolmay Pedro Oscar García Matzar, &amp; Ixchel Carmelina Espantzay Serech. 2000. Rujunamaxik ri Kaqchikel Chi’: Variación Dialectal en Kaqchikel. Guatemala City: Cholsamaj.&lt;/ref&gt; Possession by a third person singular, preconsonantal, displays K’iche’ //u-// and not Kaqchikel //ru-//. The third person pronoun is also affected, in that the mixed language shows a higher number of speakers displaying K’iche’ ''rare’'' ‘him/her/it’, instead of Kaqchikel ''rija’'' ‘him/her/it’. Function words are still marked by K’iche’ as well, with //-uk’// ‘with’ and not Kaqchikel //-ik’in//. While the majority of grammatical elements in Santa María Cauqué are presented in K’iche’, the majority of lexical elements are realized in Kaqchikel.&lt;ref name="Stevenson, Paul S 1990"/&gt;

Following Bakker and Muysken’s&lt;ref name="Bakker, Peter 1994. pp. 41-52"/&gt; criteria of mixed languages, the Cauqué Mixed Language, with its convergence of K’iche’ grammar and Kaqchikel lexicon, is a result of geographical and historical social influence of identity (López 1999&lt;ref name="Velásco, Miguel Pérez 2014"/&gt;). As documented in 1998&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"/&gt; and 2003,&lt;ref name="Grimes, B 2003"&gt;Grimes, B. 2003. “Mixed Languages.” International Encyclopedia of Linguistics, Volume 4 (second ed.). William J. Frawley (ed.). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; there are about 2,000 speakers of the Kaqchikel-K’iche’ Mixed Language in the Santa María Cauqué aldea. They are mainly adults older than 30 years of age, while there does not seem to be as much language transmission to the younger generations. These speakers also display bilingualism in the surrounding South Central Kaqchikel dialect, while the numbers of those also bilingual in Spanish continues to grow.&lt;ref name="Grimes, B 2003"/&gt; While there are previous assertions that the mixed language has not undergone structural borrowing,&lt;ref name="Romero, Sergio Francisco 2006"/&gt; there still appears to be a shift within the language to become more like Kaqchikel,&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"/&gt; since older speakers show more of a K’iche’ morphological-syntactic base.&lt;ref name="Grimes, B 2003"/&gt;

'''Cloem''' is a company based in [[Cannes]], France, which applies [[natural language processing]] (NLP) technologies to assist patent applicants in creating variants of [[patent claims]], called "cloems".&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|author=Victoria Slind-Flor |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-03/cloem-pepsico-coca-cola-indyne-intellectual-property |title=Cloem, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, InDyne: Intellectual Property |website=Bloomberg.com |date=2014-10-03 |accessdate=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the company, these "computer-generated claims can be published to keep potential competitors from attempting to file adjacent patent claims."&lt;ref name=bloomberg/&gt;
 
==Technology==
According to Cloem, dictionaries, [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] and proprietary claim-drafting algorithms are used to draft alternative claims based on a client's original set of claims.&lt;ref name=bloomberg/&gt; In particular, the original set of claims is subject to various permutations and linguistic manipulations&lt;ref name=venturebeat&gt;{{cite web |first1=Ben |last1=Hattenbach |first2=Joshua |last2=Glucoft |url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/02/16/two-new-startups-that-could-upend-intellectual-property-laws/ |title=Two new 'startups' that could upend intellectual property laws |publisher=VentureBeat |date=2015-02-16 |accessdate=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; "by considering alternative definitions for terms as well as “[[synonym]]s, [[hyponym]]s, [[hyperonym]]s, [[meronym]]s, [[holonym]]s, and [[antonym]]s.”"&lt;ref name=patentlyo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patentlyo.com/patent/2014/10/would-cloems-patent.html |title=Would you like 10,000 Cloems with that Patent? |website=Patentlyo.com |date=2014-10-01 |accessdate=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible uses==
Cloem can optionally publish one or more created texts, as electronic publications or as paper-printed publications. These can potentially serve –through a [[defensive publication]]– as [[prior art]] to prevent another party for obtaining a patent on the subject-matter at stake.&lt;ref name=venturebeat/&gt; In other words, after an initial patent filing, an "improvement" patent (adjacent invention) can be applied for by another party, such as a competitor. By publishing variants of a patent claim, the risk of adverse patenting may potentially be decreased (improvement inventions may no longer be [[patentability|patentable]]).

Cloems may also be potentially patentable. One of the issues of patentability, however, is that only a natural person can be a listed as an inventor on a patent. Since cloems are produced by a computer based on a person's input, it is not clear if the computer or the person is the inventor.&lt;ref name="patentlyo"/&gt; The [[inventorship]] of Cloem texts is an open question.&lt;ref name=venturebeat/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5092">'''Content determination''' is the subtask of [[Natural language generation]] that involves deciding on the information to be communicated in a generated text.  It is closely related to the task of [[Document structuring]].

==Example==
Consider an NLG system which summarises information about sick babies.&lt;ref name=portet&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Portet F, Reiter E, Gatt A, Hunter J, Sripada S, Freer Y, Sykes C |title=Automatic Generation of Textual Summaries from Neonatal Intensive Care Data |journal=Artificial Intelligence |volume=173 |pages=789–816 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.artint.2008.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Suppose this system has four pieces of information it can communicate
# The baby is being given morphine via an IV drop
# The baby's heart rate shows bradycardia's (temporary drops)
# The baby's temperature is normal
# The baby is crying
Which of these bits of information should be included in the generated texts?

==Issues==
There are three general issues which almost always impact the content determination task, and can be illustrated with the above example.

Perhaps the most fundamental issue is the ''communicative goal'' of the text, i.e. its ''purpose'' and ''reader''.  In the above example, for instance, a doctor who wants to make a decision about medical treatment would probably be most interested in the heart rate bradycardias, while a parent who wanted to know how her child was doing would probably be more interested in the fact that the baby was being given morphine and was crying.

The second issue is the ''size'' and ''level of detail'' of the generated text.  For instance, a short summary which was sent to a doctor as a 160 character SMS text message might only mention the heart rate bradycarias, while a longer summary which was printed out as a multipage document might also mention the fact that the baby is on a morphine IV.

The final issue is how ''unusual and unexpected'' the information is.  For example, neither doctors nor parents would place a high priority on being told that the baby's temperature was normal, if they expected this to be the case.

Regardless, content determination is very important to users, indeed in many cases the quality of content determination is the most important factor (from the user's perspective) in determining the overall quality of the generated text.

==Techniques==
There are three basic approaches to document structuring: schemas (content templates), statistical approaches, and explicit reasoning.

''Schemas'' &lt;ref&gt;K McKeown (1985). ''Text Generation''. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; are templates which explicitly specify the content of a generated text (as well as [[Document structuring]] information).  Typically they are constructed by manually analysing a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of human-written texts in the target genre, and extracting a content template from these texts.  Schemas work well in practice in domains where content is somewhat standardised, but work less well in domains where content is more fluid (such as the medical example above).

''Statistical techniques'' use statistical corpus analysis techniques to automatically determine the content of the generated texts.  Such work is in its infancy, and has mostly been applied to contexts where the communicative goal, reader, size, and level of detail are fixed.  For example, generation of newswire summaries of sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;R Barzilay and M Lapata (2005). Collective content selection for concept-to-text generation.  Proceedings of EMNLP-2005 [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/H/H05/H05-1042.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R Perera and P Nand (2014). The Role of Linked Data in Content Selection.  Proceedings of PRICAI-2014 [http://rivinduperera.com/publications/pricai2014a.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Explicit reasoning'' approaches have probably attracted the most attention from researchers.  The basic idea is to use AI reasoning techniques (such as knowledge-based rules,&lt;ref name=portet/&gt; planning,&lt;ref&gt;J Moore and C Paris (1993). Planning Text for Advisory Dialogues: Capturing Intentional and Rhetorical Information Using. Computational Linguistics 19:651-694 [http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/J/J93/J93-4004.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; pattern detection,&lt;ref&gt;J Yu, E Reiter, J Hunter, C Mellish (2007). Choosing the content of textual summaries of large time-series data sets. Natural Language Engineering 13:25-49&lt;/ref&gt; case-based reasoning,&lt;ref&gt;P Gervás, B Díaz-Agudo, F Peinado, R Hervás (2005) Story plot generation based on CBR. Knowledge-Based Systems 18:235-242&lt;/ref&gt; etc.) to examine the information available to be communicated (including how unusual/unexpected it is), the communicative goal and reader, and the characteristics of the generated text (including target size), and decide on the optimal content for the generated text.   A very wide range of techniques has been explored, but there is no consensus as to which is most effective.

[[File:Curt Wittlin.jpg|thumb|Curt Wittlin]]

== Biography ==

Wittlin studied romance philology in [[Basel]] with [[Germà Colon]], and later in [[Paris]], [[Florence]] and [[Barcelona]]. He got his PhD in 1965 with a thesis about the Catalan translation of [[Brunetto Latini]]'s ''Treasure'' by [[Guillem de Copons]]. He became Professor of Romance Philology and Historical Linguistics at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in [[Saskatoon]] ([[Canada]]), where he arrived in 1967.

He has become a specialist in the edition of medieval translations in Europe of texts by [[Cicero]], [[Saint Augustine]] and [[John of Wales]], among others. He has also worked on [[Ramon Llull]] and on the history of medieval Catalan libraries. The Catalan writer to which he has devoted most of his life is [[Francesc Eiximenis]]. Wittlin has published most of the modern editions of Francesc Eiximenis' works and has written many studies and articles about Eiximenis.

In 1997 he became a member of the [[Institute of Catalan Studies]] and from 1990 to 1993 he was president of the [[North American Catalan Society]]. In 2000 he received the ''Creu de Sant Jordi'' (Saint George cross), a high distinction given by the regional Catalan government.

'''Dhimitër Shuteriqi''' (26 July 1915 – 22 July 2003) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] scholar, literary historian, and writer.

==Life==
Dhimitër S. Shuteriqi was born in [[Elbasan]] in a patriotic and intellectual family. His father was [[Simon Shuteriqi]], participant in the Literary  [[Congress of Monastir]] (1908) and [[Congress of Elbasan]] (1909), as well as one of the founders of the [[Shkolla Normale e Elbasanit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_gXTda0HS8C&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q=simon%20shuteriqi&amp;f=false| author=Xhevat Lloshi|title=Rreth alfabetit të shqipes: me rastin e 100-vjetorit të Kongresit të Manastirit| pages=65, 75–76| publisher=Logos-A | year=2008 | isbn=9789989582684 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Shuteriqi attended the secondary school in [[Korça]]. He studied at the [[University of Grenoble]] and [[Lumière University Lyon 2|Lyon]] in [[France]] and taught school in Elbasan in 1942–1943. Shuteriqi began writing in the 1930s and was to become an influential literary historian during the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|socialist period]]. He was a member of [[Assembly of Albania|parliament]] for many years, president of the [[Albanian League of Writers and Artists]] (ALWA) from 1950 to 1973, and a member of the [[Academy of Sciences of Albania|Academy of Sciences]] from 1973.&lt;ref name="Elsie2005"&gt;{{cite book |last= Elsie |first= Robert| title= Albanian literature: a short history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox3Wx1Nl_2MC&amp;pg=PA193 |year=2005 |publisher =I.B.Tauris |isbn= 978-1-84511-031-4 |pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; As chairman of the ALWA, he participated in the [[Albanian Congress of Orthography]] of 1972 and was one of the signatories.&lt;ref name="Myftaraj"&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.kastriotmyftaraj.com/?p=335| author=Kastriot Myftaraj| language=Albanian| title=Biografia e fshehur e delegatëve të Kongresit të Drejtshkrimit të vitit 1972|trans-title=The hidden biography of the delegates of the Congress of Orthography of 1972|publisher=Telegraf|date= 30 July 2012|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhimitër Shuteriqi is remembered for his research in the fields of literature, history, and folklore, in particular for his standard histories and anthologies of Albanian literature. Among his many works are ''Shkrimet shqipe në vitet 1332–1850'' (Albanian Writing in the Years 1332–1850), Tirana 1976, ''Autorë dhe tekste'' (Authors and Texts), Tirana 1977, and ''Historia e letërsisë shqiptare'' (History of Albanian Literature), Tirana 1983.

Shuteriqi was also author of prose and poetry. His first poetry was named ''Kosova'' and was published in the [[Kosova (1932 newspaper)|''Kosova'' newspaper]] of Albanian community of [[Constanța]], [[Romania]], in 1933. He was inspired by [[Romanticism]] ([[Victor Hugo]], [[Lamartine]], [[Alfred de Vigny|De Vigny]], [[Byron]], etc.) until 1943 when he switched to [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], and later [[Socialist realism|Socialist Realism]].&lt;ref name="Andoni"&gt;{{citation|author=Ben Andoni| url=http://www.revistajava.al/dossier/2013722/ne-kujtim-te-shuteriqit| publisher=Revista Java| language=Albanian| accessdate=2014-02-14| title=Në kujtim të Shuteriqit|trans-title=In memory of Shuteriqi| year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His two-volume ''Çlirimtarët'' (The Liberators), Tirana 1952 and 1955, the first post-[[World War II]] Albanian novel, painted a picture not only of the squalor and sufferings of the peasants before the "liberation" but also of the rise of class consciousness among them. It helped set the rather sluggish pace of [[socialist realism]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Robert Elsie]]| title=Historical Dictionary of Albania| year=2010| series=Historical Dictionaries of Europe| volume=75| edition=2| publisher=Scarecrow Press| page =417| url = http://dualibra.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Historical_Dictionary_of_Albania__Second_Edition.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2918">'''Emînê Evdal''' (1906–1964), was a [[Yazidi]] writer, linguist and poet. He was born into a [[Yezidi]] village of Yamanchayir near [[Kars]] which at the time was under Russian control. His village was destroyed during the Turkish-Armenian conflict, and he lost his mother, father and brother. In 1924, he attended the workers' school in [[Tbilisi]], and in 1926 he began teaching in the Yezidi villages near Mount Elegez ([[Alagyaz]]). In 1931, he entered the [[Philology]] department of University of [[Yerevan]], and began working in the Kurdish newspaper ''[[Ria Taza (newspaper)|Rya Taza]]'' around the same period. He published his first book on Kurdish language in 1933. From 1933 to 1937, he published several textbooks on Kurdish language education. He received his PhD in Kurdology in 1944, and his thesis was entitled ''Kurdish woman in traditional family: An analysis based on study of folklore and nation''. After graduation, he worked in the Kurdology field at the Armenian Institute of History, and he was hired by the Department of Oriental Studies, Armenian Academy of Sciences in 1959. He was awarded the title of ''Best Retired Teacher'' by the [[Parliament of Armenia]] in 1960.

In addition to Kurdish, he published many research articles and books in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. He also contributed to Kurdish literature, and his first collection of short stories titled ''Casim û Tosin'' was published in 1924. The Kurdish school in the village of Qundesaz, where he taught for many years, has been named after him by the Armenia's government and his statue has been erected at the entrance of the school.

=== Overview ===
	
The Expensive Tissue Hypothesis (ETH) relates brain and gut size in evolution (specifically in human evolution). It suggests that in order for an organism to evolve a large brain without a significant increase in Basal Metabolic Rate (as seen in humans), the organism must use less energy on other expensive tissues; the paper introducing the ETH suggests that in humans, this was achieved by eating an easy-to-digest diet and evolving a smaller, less energy intensive gut. &lt;ref&gt;Aiello, L., &amp; Wheeler, P. (1995). The Expensive-Tissue Hypothesis: The Brain and the Digestive System in Human and Primate Evolution. Current Anthropology, 36(2), 199-221. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/2744104&lt;/ref&gt; The ETH has inspired many research projects to test its validity in primates and other organisms.
=== Original Paper ===
	The original paper introducing the ETH was written by Dr. Leslie Aiello and Dr. Peter Wheeler. In the paper, they sought to explain how humans managed to have energy for their large and metabolically expensive brains while still maintaining a Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) comparable to other primates with smaller brains. They found that the humans’ smaller relative gut size almost completely compensated for the metabolic cost of the larger brain. They went on to postulate that a larger brain would allow for more complex foraging behavior, which would result in a higher quality diet, which would then allow the gut to shrink further, freeing up more energy for the brain. This research also presented a case for studying the evolution of organs in a more interconnected manner, rather than in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Aiello, L., &amp; Wheeler, P. (1995). The Expensive-Tissue Hypothesis: The Brain and the Digestive System in Human and Primate Evolution. Current Anthropology, 36(2), 199-221. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/2744104&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Further Research ===
	The academic debate around the ETH is still active, and has inspired a number of similar tests, all attempting to verify the ETH with another species or group of species by looking at encephalization (a ratio between brain size and body size), gut size, and/or diet quality. Primates, being the closes living relatives to humans, are a natural extension to the hypothesis, and as such are examined by many of these tests. One such study supported the expensive tissue hypothesis and found a positive correlation between diet quality and brain size (as would be expected by the original paper), but it did note that there were exceptions among the species tested &lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. L. and Lockwood, C. A. (2003), Dietary constraints on encephalization in primates. Am. J. Phys. Anthropol., 120: 171-181. doi:10.1002/ajpa.10136&lt;/ref&gt;. A broader study including primates and other mammals disputed the ETH, finding that there is no negative correlation between brain and gut sizes; it did, however, support the idea of energy trade offs in evolution as it found a negative correlation between encephalization and adipose (fat) deposits&lt;ref&gt;Navarrete, A., Schaik, C. P., &amp; Isler, K. (2011). Energetics and the evolution of human brain size. Nature, 480(7375), 91-93. doi:10.1038/nature10629&lt;/ref&gt;.
	Studies have also been done in species less similar to humans, such as anurans and fish. The study of anurans found that among the 30 species tested, there was a significant negative correlation between gut size and brain size, as Aiello and Wheeler found in humans and primates in their original research &lt;ref&gt;Jason A. Kaufman, Claude Marcel Hladik, and Patrick Pasquet, "On the Expensive‐Tissue Hypothesis: Independent Support from Highly Encephalized Fish," Current Anthropology 44, no. 5 (December 2003): 705-707.&lt;/ref&gt;. One study of fish used the carnivorous fish Gnathonemus petersii, which has a uniquely large brain, about three times the size expected of a fish of its size. The research found that these fish also had significantly smaller guts than other similar carnivorous fish &lt;ref&gt;Jason A. Kaufman, Claude Marcel Hladik, and Patrick Pasquet, "On the Expensive‐Tissue Hypothesis: Independent Support from Highly Encephalized Fish," Current Anthropology 44, no. 5 (December 2003): 705-707.&lt;/ref&gt;. These further studies enrich the debate over the ETH.

A '''fast abstract''', also '''extended abstract''', is a short, lightly reviewed technical [[Academic publishing#Scholarly paper|article]] that is usually presented with a short talk at a [[scientific conference]]. The length of the document is usually limited to 2 pages (including all text, figures, references and appendices), although some conferences may allow slightly longer articles.&lt;ref name="4pages"/&gt; If the conference does not specify a document style, the standard double-column [[IEEE format]] is a common practice. 

The concept of a "fast abstract" was created at the 28th [[Fault-Tolerant Computing Symposium]], 1998, by Ram Chillarege, who was the program co-chair of the conference.&lt;ref name="chillarege"/&gt; They are meant to promote communication and discussion of subjects that have yet to be established or completed as research projects, and to provide a venue for reporting barely tested ideas, early experiments, or opinions. While informal discussions, stand-up talks, and round tables provide an avenue for such sharing, they lack the written record that is essential for academic progress. Fast abstracts aim to fill this gap.&lt;ref name="chillarege"/&gt; Since their inception, fast abstract sessions have been gradually adopted by several conferences,&lt;ref name="chillarege"/&gt; in some cases even being among the most attended sessions.&lt;ref name="popular"/&gt;

Due to their purpose and short length, fast abstracts do not require a full treatment of results as expected of a full paper published at a conference or journal. Even less formal publications such as [[working paper]]s and [[technical report]]s are usually based on established research projects, and on the other hand these rarely are peer reviewed before publication, and there is no formal publishing procedures for such reports. Fast abstracts differ in these two aspects, and being (as the name indicates) fast to write and fast to review, they create a mechanism to promote a rich and timely exchange of experiences, and receive early feedback from the community. 

Fast abstracts allow authors to:
* Report technical work at preliminary stages, and solicit early feedback
* Present radical opinions on controversial issues or open problems
* Introduce new issues to investigate
* Present experience obtained from practice

Fast abstract sessions can collect a diverse set of contributions, from young students initiating their research work, to senior researchers and distinguished members of the community. Furthermore, they allow industrial practitioners and academics who may not have been able to prepare full papers due to time and work pressure, but nevertheless seek an opportunity to engage with the community, to exchange their ideas and solutions, as well as technical problems and practical experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3456">'''Karl Folke Sigvard Mellvig''' (23 May 1913 in [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]]&amp;ndash;4 September 1994 in [[Haninge Municipality]], [[Stockholm County]], Sweden) was a Swedish [[writer]] and [[screenwriter]].

Mellvig was one of [[Sweden]]'s most popular [[crime writer]]s in the 1950s and 1960s, with murder mysteries set in "peaceful" Swedish summer time; at countryside locations and often in aristocratic or upper-class environments. His crime-solving middle-class city couple Kajsa and John Hillman (with their fumbling assistant Freddy) are famous, later on popular characters in the early Swedish thriller/crime films - the so-called "Hillman-thrillers", directed by [[Arne Mattsson]] (all with an effectful colour in the title). The most successful of these films were ''The Lady in Black'' and ''Mannequin in Red'' (both released in 1958). The first book on the Hillman-couple was published in 1951 ''(Uppdrag för Hillman/"A Mission For Hillman")'' and then several books followed on the couple but only a few selected were adapted to film.

Folke Mellvig was brother to the Swedish [[actor]] [[Börje Mellvig]].

'''''Frege: Philosophy of Language''''' (1973; second edition 1981) is a book about [[Gottlob Frege]] by the British philosopher [[Michael Dummett]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Low05|Lowe 2005]]. p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book has been highly influential. Together with ''[[Frege: Philosophy of Mathematics]]'' (1991), it is Dummett's chief contribution to Frege scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Low99|Lowe 1999]]. p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Dummett's epistemological interpretation of the idea of a route to reference has been seen as unnecessary by [[Daniel Dennett]]. The philosopher [[Roger Scruton]], writing in ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986), endorsed Dennett's view.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scr94|Scruton 1994]]. p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Heidegger]], the [[20th century philosophy|20th-century]] [[List of German-language philosophers|German philosopher]], produced a large body of work that intended a profound change of direction for [[philosophy]]. Such was the depth of change that he found it necessary to introduce a large number of [[neologisms]], often connected to idiomatic words and phrases in the German language.

Two of his most basic neologisms, '''present-at-hand''' and '''ready-to-hand''', are used to describe various attitudes toward things in the world. For Heidegger, such "attitudes" are prior to, i.e. more basic than, the various sciences of the individual items in the world. Science itself is an attitude, one that attempts a kind of neutral investigation. Other related terms are also explained below.

Heidegger's overall analysis is quite involved, taking in a lot of the history of philosophy. See ''[[Being and Time]]'' for a description of his overall project, and to give some context to these technical terms.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Being and Time'', trans. John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, H.67–72&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC right}}

== Terms ==

===''Aletheia''===
:([[Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: ἀλήθεια)
{{Main|Aletheia}}

Heidegger's idea of ''[[aletheia]]'', or [[world disclosure|disclosure]] (''Erschlossenheit''), was an attempt to make sense of how things in the world appear to human beings as part of an opening in intelligibility, as "unclosedness" or "unconcealedness". (This is Heidegger's usual reading of ''aletheia'' as ''Unverborgenheit'', "unconcealment.")&lt;ref&gt;Rodney R. Coltman, [https://books.google.gr/books?id=DUEjKCKhigMC&amp;dq=Aletheia+verborgenheit&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Language of Hermeneutics: Gadamer and Heidegger in Dialogue''], SUNY Press, 1998, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the notion of [[world disclosure]], the way in which things get their sense as part of a holistically structured, pre-interpreted background of meaning. Initially, Heidegger wanted ''aletheia'' to stand for a re-interpreted definition of [[truth]]. However, he later corrected the association of ''aletheia'' with truth.

=== Apophantic ===
:([[German language|German]]: ''apophantisch'')

An assertion (as opposed to a question, a doubt or a more expressive sense) is '''apophantic'''. It is a statement that covers up meaning and just gives us something as present-at-hand. For Instance, "The President is on vacation", and, "Salt is Sodium Chloride" are sentences that, because of their apophantic character, can easily be picked-up and repeated in news and gossip by 'The They.' However, the real ''ready-to-hand'' meaning and context may be lost.

===Being-in-the-world===
:(German: ''In-der-Welt-sein'')

Being-in-the-world is Heidegger's replacement for terms such as subject, object, consciousness, and world. For him, the split of things into subject/object, as we find in the Western tradition and even in our language, must be overcome, as is indicated by the root structure of [[Husserl]] and [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]]'s concept of [[intentionality]], i.e., that all consciousness is consciousness of something, that there is no consciousness, as such, cut off from an object (be it the matter of a thought or of a perception). Nor are there objects without some consciousness beholding or being involved with them.

At the most basic level of ''being-in-the-world,'' Heidegger notes that there is always a mood, a mood that "assails us" in our unreflecting devotion to the world. A mood comes neither from the "outside" nor from the "inside," but arises from being-in-the-world. One may turn away from a mood but that is only to another mood; it is part of our [[facticity]]. Only with a mood are we permitted to encounter things in the world. ''[[Dasein]]'' (a co-term for being-in-the-world) has an openness to the world that is constituted by the attunement of a mood or state of mind. As such, ''Dasein'' is a "[[Thrownness|thrown]]" "projection" (''geworfener Entwurf''), projecting itself onto the possibilities that lie before it or may be hidden, and interpreting and understanding the world in terms of possibilities. Such projecting has nothing to do with comporting oneself toward a plan that has been thought out. It is not a plan, since ''Dasein'' has, as ''Dasein'', already projected itself. ''Dasein'' always understands itself in terms of possibilities. As projecting, the understanding of ''Dasein'' is its possibilities ''as'' possibilities. One can take up the possibilities of "The They" self and merely follow along or make some more authentic understanding (see [[Hubert Dreyfus]]'s book ''Being-in-the-World''.)

===Being-toward-death===
:(German: ''Sein-zum-Tode'')

Being-toward-death is '''not''' an orientation that brings ''[[Dasein]]'' closer to its end, in terms of clinical death, but is rather '''a way of being'''.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, H.247.&lt;/ref&gt; Being-toward-death refers to a process of growing through the world where a certain foresight guides the ''Dasein'' towards gaining an authentic perspective. It is provided by [[Angst|dread]] or death. In the analysis of time, it is revealed as a threefold condition of [[Being]]. Time, the present and the notion of the "eternal", are modes of temporality. Temporality is the way we see time. For Heidegger, it is very different from the mistaken view of time as being a linear series of past, present and future. Instead he sees it as being an [[Ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstasy]], an outside-of-itself, of futural projections (possibilities) and one's place in history as a part of one's generation. Possibilities, then, are integral to our understanding of time; our projects, or thrown projection in-the-world, are what absorb and direct us. Futurity, as a direction toward the future that always contains the past—the has-been—is a primary mode of ''Dasein''{{'}}s temporality.

Death is that possibility which is the absolute impossibility of ''Dasein''. As such, it cannot be compared to any other kind of ending or "running out" of something. For example, one's death is not an [[empirical]] event. For Heidegger, death is ''Dasein''{{'}}s ownmost (it is what makes ''Dasein'' individual), it is non-relational (nobody can take one's death away from one, or die in one's place, and we can not understand our own death through the death of other ''Dasein''), and it is not to be outstripped. The "not-yet" of life is always already a part of ''Dasein'': "as soon as man comes to life, he is at once old enough to die." The threefold condition of death is thus simultaneously one's ''"ownmost potentiality-for-being, non-relational, and not to be out-stripped"''. Death is determinate in its inevitability, but an authentic Being-toward-death understands the indeterminate nature of one's own inevitable death — one never knows when or how it is going to come. However, this indeterminacy does not put death in some distant, futural "not-yet"; authentic Being-toward-death understands one's individual death as always already a part of one.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, H.255.&lt;/ref&gt;

With average, everyday (normal) discussion of death, all this is concealed. The "they-self" talks about it in a fugitive manner, passes it off as something that occurs at some time but is not yet "present-at-hand" as an ''actuality'', and hides its character as one's ownmost possibility, presenting it as belonging to no one in particular. It becomes devalued — redefined as a neutral and mundane aspect of existence that merits no authentic consideration. "One dies" is interpreted as a [[facticity|fact]], and comes to mean "nobody dies".&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, H.253-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] takes ''Dasein'' out of the "They," in part by revealing its place as a part of the They. Heidegger states that ''Authentic being-toward-death'' calls ''Dasein''{{'}}s individual self out of its "they-self", and frees it to re-evaluate life from the standpoint of finitude. In so doing, ''Dasein'' opens itself up for "[[angst]]," translated alternately as "dread" or as "anxiety." Angst, as opposed to fear, does not have any distinct object for its dread; it is rather anxious in the face of Being-in-the-world in general — that is, it is anxious in the face of ''Dasein''{{'}}s own self. Angst is a shocking individuation of ''Dasein'', when it realizes that it is not at home in the world, or when it comes face to face with its own "[[uncanny]]" (German ''Unheimlich'' "not homelike"). In ''Dasein''{{'}}s individuation, it is open to hearing the "call of conscience" (German ''Gewissensruf''), which comes from ''Dasein''{{'}}s own Self when it wants to be its Self. This Self is then open to truth, understood as unconcealment (Greek ''aletheia''). In this moment of vision, ''Dasein'' understands what is hidden as well as hiddenness itself, indicating Heidegger's regular uniting of opposites; in this case, truth and untruth.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, H.260–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Being-with===
:(German: ''Mitsein'')

The term "Being-with" refers to an ontological characteristic of the human being, that it is always already&lt;ref&gt;By "[[always already]]" Heidegger means that every phenomenological inspection of the human being finds this characteristic.  It is not founded on something else.&lt;/ref&gt; with others of its kind. This assertion is to be understood not as a factual statement about an individual, that he or she is at the moment in spatial proximity to one or more other individuals.  Rather it is a statement about the being of every human, that in the structures of its being-in-the-world one finds an implicit reference to other humans. We all live with others, and in fact we could not live without them. Humans have been called (by others, not by Heidegger) "ultrasocial"&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, Jonathan. ''The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom''. New York: Basic Books, 2006, pp. 47 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  and "obligatorily gregarious."&lt;ref&gt;de Waal, Frans. ''Primates and Philosophers: How Morality Evolved''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Without others of our kind we could not survive. Heidegger, from his phenomenological perspective, calls this feature of human life "Being-with" (''Mitsein''), and says it is essential to being human.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, p. 156, H.125.&lt;/ref&gt; We are inauthentic when we fail to recognize how much and in what ways how we think of ourselves and how we habitually behave is influenced by our social surroundings. We are authentic when we pay attention to that influence and decide for ourselves whether to go along with it or not. Living entirely without such influence, however, is not an option.

===Care (or concern)===
{{Anchor|Care}}
:(German: ''Sorge'')

A fundamental basis of our being-in-the-world is, for Heidegger, not matter or spirit but care''':

::Dasein's [[facticity]] is such that its Being-in-the-world has always dispersed itself or even split itself up into definite ways of Being-in. The multiplicity of these is indicated by the following examples: having to do with something, producing something, attending to something and looking after it, making use of something, giving something up and letting it go, undertaking, accomplishing, evincing, interrogating, considering, discussing, determining. . . .&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, H.56&lt;/ref&gt;

All these ways of Being-in have concern (''Sorge'', [[wikt:cura|care]]) as their kind of Being. Just as the scientist might investigate or search, and presume neutrality, we see that beneath this there is the mood, the concern of the scientist to discover, to reveal new ideas or theories and to attempt to level off temporal aspects.

===Clearing===
{{anchor|Lichtung}}
:(German: ''Lichtung'')

In German the word ''Lichtung'' means a clearing, as in, for example, a clearing in the woods. Since its root is the German word for light (''Licht''), it is sometimes also translated as "lighting," and in Heidegger's work it refers to the necessity of a clearing in which anything at all can appear, the clearing in which some thing or idea can show itself, or be unconcealed.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, H.133&lt;/ref&gt; Note the relation that this has to ''Aletheia'' (see the [[Aletheia|main article]] or the entry above) and [[world disclosure|disclosure]].

Beings (''Seiendes''), but not Being itself (''Sein''), stand out as if in a clearing, or physically, as if in a space.&lt;ref&gt;This notion of the clearing, or of aspects pertaining to the leeway, spacing, giving room, and dwelling are treated in: [[Nader El-Bizri]] "ON KAI KHORA: Situating Heidegger between the Sophist and the Timaeus," ''Studia Phaenomenologica'', Vol. IV, Issues 1-2 (2004), pp. 73–98; [[Nader El-Bizri]], "Being at Home Among Things: Heidegger’s Reflections on Dwelling", ''Environment, Space, Place'', Vol. 3 (2011), pp. 47–71; Nader El-Bizri, "On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology", Studia UBB. Philosophia, Vol. 60, No. 1 (2015): 5-30.  See also [[Khôra]] and [[Phenomenology (architecture)]] in addition to the 'architecture' section under the main Heidegger entry on Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Hubert Dreyfus]] writes, "things show up in the light of our understanding of being."&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus, ''Being-in-the-World''. Cambridge: MIT Press, 1995. p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the clearing makes possible the disclosure of beings (''Seiendes''), and also access to Dasein's own being. But the clearing is not, itself, an entity that can be known directly, in the sense in which know about the entities of the world. As Heidegger writes in ''On the Origin of the Work of Art'':

:"In the midst of being as a whole an open place occurs. There is a clearing, a lighting. Thought of in reference to what is, to beings, this clearing is in a greater degree than are beings. This open center is therefore not surrounded by what is; rather, the lighting center itself encircles all that is, like the Nothing which we scarcely know. That which is can only be, as a being, if it stands within and stands out within what is lighted in this clearing. Only this clearing grants and guarantees to us humans a passage to those beings that we ourselves are not, and access to the being that we ourselves are." &lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, M. 2001, On the Origin of the Work of Art. In Poetry, language, thought. (A. Hofstadter, Trans.) (1st ed.). New York: Perennical Classics. (Original work published 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Destruktion''===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Deconstruction]] --&gt;
Founded in the work of [[Martin Luther]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowe|first1=Benjamin|authorlink=Benjamin D. Crowe|title=Heidegger's Religious Origins: Destruction and Authenticity|date=2006|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=0253347068|page=2; also see 7|edition=Hardcover|quote=Heidegger... chose a name for it which itself reflects the importance of Luther to his thinking: '&lt;i&gt;Destruktion&lt;/i&gt;', a Germanized version of the term '&lt;i&gt;destructio&lt;/i&gt;' used quite frequently in Luther's early writings.}}&lt;/ref&gt; here is Martin Heidegger on philosophy as the task of destroying [[Ontology|ontological concept]]s, in other words also including, ordinary everyday meanings of words like time, history, being, theory, death, mind, body, matter, logic etc.:

:When tradition thus becomes master, it does so in such a way that what it 'transmits' is made so inaccessible, proximally and for the most part, that it rather becomes concealed. Tradition takes what has come down to us and delivers it over to self-evidence; it blocks our access to those primordial 'sources' from which the categories and concepts handed down to us have been in part quite genuinely drawn. Indeed it makes us forget that they have had such an origin, and makes us suppose that the necessity of going back to these sources is something which we need not even understand. (''Being and Time'', p. 43)

Heidegger considers that tradition can become calcified here and there:
:If the question of Being is to have its own history made transparent, then this hardened tradition must be loosened up, and the concealments which it has brought about dissolved. We understand this task as one in which by taking the question of Being as our clue we are to destroy the traditional content of ancient ontology until we arrive at those primordial experiences in which we achieved our first ways of determining the nature of Being—the ways which have guided us ever since. (''Being and Time'', p. 44)

Heidegger then remarks on the positivity of his project of ''Destruktion'':
:it has nothing to do with a vicious relativizing of ontological standpoints. But this destruction is just as far from having the negative sense of shaking off the ontological tradition. We must, on the contrary, stake out the positive possibilities of that tradition, and this means keeping it within its limits; and these in turn are given factically in the way the question is formulated at the time, and in the way the possible field for investigation is thus bounded off. On its negative side, this destruction does not relate itself toward the past; its criticism is aimed at 'today' and at the prevalent way of treating the history of ontology. .. But to bury the past in nullity (Nichtigkeit) is not the purpose of this destruction; its aim is positive; its negative function remains unexpressed and indirect. (''Being and Time'', p. 44)

===''Dasein''===
{{Main|Dasein}}

''Dasein'' is a German word and is sometimes translated as "being-there" or "being-here" (''da'' combines in its meaning "here" and "there", excluding the spatial-relational distinction made by the English words; ''Sein'' is the infinitive, "to be"). It is the German form of the [[Copula (linguistics)#Existential usage|existential expletive]], which, as in most European languages, is expressed idiomatically. Heidegger, after [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], used the word, but as a gerund synonym for "human being" or "human entity." A Dasein is then a new coinage for a being that is there, ''in a familiar world'', and in a mood. Dasein also has unique capacities for language, intersubjective communication, and detached reasoning. Heidegger does not want to get tied up with overused and ambiguous words such as "person," "consciousness," "soul," or "spirit," so Dasein is a new way of approaching something all of those other words point towards, but without the connotations. Dasein is the starting point of Heidegger's ontology. It is typically thought to apply to humans, but it could apply to any being that fulfills the definition's characteristics which he states. What makes a being a Dasein is as follows: Dasein is a being whose being is an issue for itself; every Dasein has an a priori sense of "mineness," or being one's self; Dasein is always thrown into the world, meaning it finds itself within a world, meaning no Dasein has ever been decontextualized. We are all world-bound, submerged, entangled, and engaged with our ontico-ontological surroundings through care, concern, and moods. Dasein has various modes of being-in-the-world, which are the subject of much of Heidegger's analysis in Being and Time. Furthermore, average humans have a pre-ontological (general intuitive sense of being) understanding of being insofar as they understand ''what'' things are and ''that'' they are e.g. "My dog is brown" or "Today is Sunday." Heidegger believed that this pre-reflective understanding of being, that which determines entities ''as'' entities,&lt;ref&gt;''Being and Time'' (1962), pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt; helps constitute our unique existence as human beings, thus the coinage of "''[[Dasein]]''."

===Disclosure===
:(German: ''Erschlossenheit'')
{{Main|World disclosure}}

[[Hubert Dreyfus]] and Charles Spinosa write that: "According to Heidegger our nature is to be world disclosers. That is, by means of our equipment and coordinated practices we human beings open coherent, distinct contexts or worlds in which we perceive, feel, act, and think."&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus and Charles Spinosa, "Further Reflections on Heidegger, Technology and the Everyday," in Nikolas Kompridis, ed. ''Philosophical Romanticism'', New York: Routledge, 2006, 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger scholar [[Nikolas Kompridis]] writes: "World disclosure refers, with deliberate ambiguity, to a process which actually occurs at two different levels. At one level, it refers to the disclosure of an already interpreted, symbolically structured world; the world, that is, within which we always already find ourselves. At another level, it refers as much to the disclosure of new horizons of meaning as to the disclosure of previously hidden or unthematized dimensions of meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, "On World Disclosure: Heidegger, Habermas and Dewey," Thesis Eleven 1994; 37; 29-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Reflective disclosure}}

===Discourse===
{{anchor|Rede}}
:(German: ''Rede'')
The ontological-existential structure of Dasein consists of "thrownness" (''Geworfenheit''), "projection" (''Entwurf''), and "being-along-with"/"engagement" (''Sein-bei''). These three basic features of existence are inseparably bound to "discourse" (''Rede''), understood as the deepest unfolding of language.&lt;ref&gt;Parvis Emad, ''On the Way to Heidegger’s Contributions to Philosophy'', University of Wisconsin Press, 2007, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equipment===
{{anchor|das Zeug}}
:(German: ''das Zeug'')
An object in the world with which we have meaningful dealings.

A nearly un-translatable term, Heidegger's equipment can be thought of as a collective noun, so that it is never appropriate to call something 'an equipment'. Instead, its use often reflects it to mean a tool, or as an "in-order-to" for Dasein. Tools, in this collective sense, and in being ''ready-to-hand'', always exist in a network of other tools and organizations, e.g., the paper is on a desk in a room at a university. It is inappropriate usually to see such equipment on its own or as something ''present-at-hand''.

Another, less prosaic, way of thinking of 'equipment' is as 'stuff we can work with' around us, along with its context. "The paper we can do things with, from the desk, in the university, in the city, on the world, in the universe." 'Equipment' refers to the thing, and its usefulness possibilities, and its context.

===''Ereignis''===
'''''Ereignis''''' is translated often as "an event," but is better understood in terms of something "coming into view." It comes from the German prefix, ''er-'', comparable to 're-' in English, and ''Auge'', eye.&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. H. Polt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cVRgERTtIeEC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=ereignis+etymology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ieh1CUhKeG&amp;sig=l6CCuQ0J-eT1q-KluXRJ5v9Xxug&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=87-LSpjcL4GMsAbj_ojKDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=ereignis%20etymology&amp;f=false ''The Emergency of Being: On Heidegger's Contributions to Philosophy''], Richard F. H. Polt, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Giorgio Agamben]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=l52xC43N_2kC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=ereignis+etymology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=opgRBXjjsv&amp;sig=Wd3pXLVbxq23LgVqCXQxqPbdMUs&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=87-LSpjcL4GMsAbj_ojKDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=ereignis%20etymology&amp;f=false ''Potentialities: Collected Essays''], Stanford University Press, 1999, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a noun coming from a reflexive verb. Note that the German prefix ''er-'' also can connote an end or a fatality. A recent translation of the word by Kenneth Maly and Parvis Emad renders the word as "enowning"; that in connection with things that arise and appear, that they are arising 'into their own'. [[Hubert Dreyfus]] defined the term as "things coming into themselves by belonging together."

Ereignis appears in Heidegger's later works and is not easily summarized. The most sustained treatment of the theme occurs in the cryptic and difficult ''Contributions to Philosophy''. In the following quotation he associates it with the fundamental idea of concern from ''Being and Time'', the English etymology of ''con-cern'' is similar to that of the German:

:: ...we must return to what we call a concern. The word Ereignis (concern) has been lifted from organically developing language. Er-eignen (to concern) means, originally, to distinguish or discern which one's eyes see, and in seeing calling to oneself, ap-propriate. The word con-cern we shall now harness as a theme word in the service of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Identity and Difference'', trans. Joan Stambaugh. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existence===
:(German ''Existenz'')
Heidegger uses this word to describe the nature of ''[[Dasein]]'''s being. Beings unlike ''Dasein'' (chairs, shoes, etc.) do not "exist"; they are merely "objectively present". ''Dasein'' exists; chairs are objectively present.

Two related words, ''existenziell'' and ''Existential'', are used as descriptive characteristics of Being. To be ''existenziell'' is a categorical or [[#Ontic|ontic]] characteristic: an understanding of all this which relates to one's existence, while an ''Existenzial'' is an [[#Ontological|ontological]] characteristic: the structure of existence.

===''Geworfenheit''===
{{main|Thrownness}}
''Geworfenheit'' describes our individual existences as "being thrown" (''geworfen'') into the world. For [[William J. Richardson]], Heidegger used this single term, "thrown-ness," to "describe [the] two elements of the original situation, There-being's non-mastery of its own origin and its referential dependence on other beings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=William J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5y4QAQAAIAAJ|title=Heidegger.

Heidegger himself held between 1 and 4 December 1949 at [[Bremen]] Club four lectures, which were repeated in the spring of 1950 (25 and 26 March) unchanged at [[w:de:Bühlerhöhe|Bühlerhöhe]]. The titles were ''Das Ding'', ''Das Gestell'', ''Die Gefahr'' and ''Die Kehre''. The second and third lecture were reworked into a larger text in 1953 with the title ''Die Frage nach der Technik'' and in this form published in 1954 in the collection ''Vorträge und Aufsätze'', which also included a slightly reworked version of the first lecture, ''Das Ding''. In 1962, ''Die Frage nach der Technik'' and the fourth lecture ''Die Kehre'' were published together in a small book called ''Die Technik und die Kehre'', which is still in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|title=Die Technik und die Kehre|others=13th edition, 2014|publisher=Klett-Cotta|id={{ISBN|978-3-6089-1050-6}} The book's preface states incorrectly that 'Die Frage nach der Technik' corresponds to just the second Bremen lecture.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bremen lectures were published all four together, and in their original form, only in 1994 in volume 79 of the Gesamtausgabe.

===Ontic===
:(German: ''ontisch'')
{{main|ontic}}
Heidegger uses the term '''ontic,''' often in contrast to the term '''ontological''', when he gives descriptive characteristics of a particular thing and the "plain facts" of its existence. What is ontic is what makes something what it is.

For an individual discussing the nature of "being", one's ontic could refer to the physical, factual elements that produce and/or underlie one's own reality - the physical brain and its substructures. Moralists raise the question of a moral ontic when discussing whether there exists an external, objective, independent source or wellspring for morality that transcends culture and time.

===Ontological===
:(German: ''ontologisch'')

As opposed to "ontic" (''ontisch''), '''ontological''' is used when the nature, or meaningful structure of existence is at issue. [[Ontology]], a [[discipline]] of philosophy, focuses on the formal study of Being. Thus, something that is ontological is concerned with understanding and investigating Being, the ground of Being, or the concept of Being itself.

For an individual discussing the nature of "being", the ontological could refer to one's own first-person, subjective, phenomenological experience of being.

===Possibility===
:(German: ''Möglichkeit'')
A term used only once in a particular edition of ''Being and Time''. In the text, the term appears to denote "the possibility whose probability it is solely to be possible". At least, if it were used in context, this is the only plausible definition.

===Present-at-hand===
:(German: ''vorhanden''; ''Vorhandenheit'' "presence-at-hand")

With the '''present-at-hand''' one has (in contrast to "ready-to-hand") an attitude like that of a scientist or theorist, of merely looking at or observing something. In seeing an entity as present-at-hand, the beholder is concerned only with the bare facts of a thing or a concept, as they are present and in order to '''theorize''' about it. This way of seeing is disinterested in the concern it may hold for Dasein, its history or usefulness. This attitude is often described as existing in neutral space without any particular mood or subjectivity. However, for Heidegger, it is not completely disinterested or neutral. It has a mood, and is part of the [[metaphysics of presence]] that tends to level all things down. Through his writings, Heidegger sets out to accomplish the ''Destruktion'' (see above) of this metaphysics of presence.

'''Presence-at-hand''' is not the way things in the world are usually encountered, and it is only revealed as a deficient or secondary mode, e.g., when a hammer breaks it loses its usefulness and appears as merely there, present-at-hand. When a thing is revealed as present-at-hand, it stands apart from any useful set of equipment but soon loses this mode of being present-at-hand and becomes something, for example, that which must be repaired or replaced.

===Ready-to-hand===
:(German ''griffbereit'', ''zuhanden''; ''Zuhandenheit'' "readiness-to-hand, handiness")

However, in almost all cases we are involved in the world in an ordinary, and more involved, way. We are usually doing things with a view to achieving something. Take for example, a hammer: it is ready-to-hand; we use it without theorizing. In fact, if we were to look at it as present-at-hand, we might easily make a mistake. Only when it breaks or something goes wrong might we see the hammer as present-at-hand, just lying there. Even then however, it may be not fully present-at-hand, as it is now showing itself as something to be repaired or disposed, and therefore a part of the totality of our involvements. In this case its Being may be seen as unreadiness-to-hand. Heidegger outlines three manners of unreadiness-to-hand: Conspicuous (damaged; e.g., a lamp's wiring has broken), Obtrusive (a part is missing which is required for the entity to function; e.g., we find the bulb is missing), Obstinate (when the entity is a hindrance to us in pursuing a project; e.g., the lamp blocks my view of the computer screen).

Importantly, the ready-to-hand only emerges from the prior attitude in which we care about what is going on and we see the hammer in a context or world of equipment that is handy or remote, and that is there "in order to" do something. In this sense the ''ready-to-hand'' is ''primordial'' compared to that of the '''present-at-hand'''. The term primordial here does not imply something Primitive, but rather refers to Heidegger's idea that Being can only be understood through what is everyday and "close" to us. Our everyday understanding of the world is necessarily essentially a part of any kind of scientific or theoretical studies of entities — the present-at-hand — might be. Only by studying our "average-everyday" understanding of the world, as it is expressed in the totality of our relationships to the ready-to-hand entities of the world, can we lay appropriate bases for specific scientific investigations into specific entities within the world.

For Heidegger in ''Being and Time'' this illustrates, in a very practical way, the way the present-at-hand, as a present in a "now" or a present eternally (as, for example, a scientific law or a Platonic Form), has come to dominate intellectual thought, especially since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. To understand the question of [[being]] one must be careful not to fall into this leveling off, or forgetfulness of being, that has come to assail Western thought since Socrates, see the [[metaphysics of presence]].

===Resoluteness===
:(German: ''Entschlossenheit'')

Resoluteness refers to one's ability to "unclose" one's framework of intelligibility (i.e., to make sense of one's words and actions in terms of one's life as a whole), and the ability to be receptive to the "call of conscience."

===The One / the They===
{{anchor|das Man}}
:(German: ''Das Man'', meaning "they-self")

One of the most interesting and important 'concepts' in ''Being and Time'' is that of ''Das Man'', for which there is no exact English translation; different translations and commentators use different conventions. It is often translated as "the They" or "People" or "Anyone" but is more accurately translated as "One" (as in "'one' should always arrive on time"). ''Das Man'' derives from the impersonal singular pronoun ''man'' ('one', as distinct from 'I', or 'you', or 'he', or 'she', or 'they'). Both the German ''man'' and the English 'one' are neutral or indeterminate in respect of gender and, even, in a sense, of number, though both words suggest an unspecified, unspecifiable, indeterminate plurality. The semantic role of the word ''man'' in German is nearly identical to that of the word ''one'' in English.

Heidegger refers to this concept of ''the One'' in explaining inauthentic modes of existence, in which Dasein, instead of truly choosing to do something, does it only because "That is what one does" or "That is what people do". Thus, ''das Man'' is not a proper or measurable entity, but rather an amorphous part of social reality that functions effectively in the manner that it does through this intangibility.

''Das Man'' constitutes a possibility of Dasein's Being, and so ''das Man'' cannot be said to be any particular someone. Rather, the existence of 'the They' is known to us through, for example, linguistic conventions and social norms. Heidegger states that, "The "they" prescribes one's state-of-mind, and determines what and how one 'sees'".

To give examples: when one makes an appeal to what is commonly known, one says "one does not do such a thing"; When one sits in a car or bus or reads a newspaper, one is participating in the world of 'the They'. This is a feature of 'the They' as it functions in society, an authority that has no particular source. In a non-moral sense Heidegger contrasts "the authentic self" ("my owned self") with "the they self" ("my un-owned self").

A related concept to this is that of the ''apophantic assertion''.

===World===
:(German: ''Welt'')
{{Further|World disclosure}}

Heidegger gives us four ways of using the term world:

::1. "World" is used as an ontical concept, and signifies the totality of things which can be present-at-hand within the world.

::2. "World" functions as an ontological term, and signifies the Being of those things we have just mentioned. And indeed 'world' can become a term for any realm which encompasses a multiplicity of entities: for instance, when one talks of the 'world' of a mathematician, 'world' signifies the realm of possible objects of mathematics.

::3. "World" can be understood in another ontical sense—not, however, as those entities which Dasein essentially is not and which can be encountered within-the-world, but rather as the ''wherein'' a factical Dasein as such can be said to 'live'. "World" has here a pre-ontological [[existentiell]] signification. Here again there are different possibilities: "world" may stand for the 'public' we-world, or one's 'own' closest (domestic) environment.

::4. Finally, "world" designates the ontologico-existential concept of ''worldhood'' (''Weltheit''). Worldhood itself may have as its modes whatever structural wholes any special 'worlds' may have at the time; but it embraces in itself the ''a priori'' character of worldhood in general.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, H.64&lt;/ref&gt;

Note, it is the third definition that Heidegger normally uses.

The '''Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting''' ('''ISDB'''; [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: {{nihongo|統合デジタル放送サービス}}, ''Tōgō dejitaru hōsō sābisu'') is a [[Japan]]ese standard for [[digital television]] (DTV) and [[digital radio]] used by the country's [[Radio network|radio]] and [[television network]]s. ISDB replaced [[NTSC-J]] analog television system and the previously used ''[[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]] Hi-vision'' analogue HDTV system in Japan, and will be replacing [[NTSC]], [[PAL-M]] and [[PAL|PAL-N]] in [[South America]] and the [[Philippines]]. [[Digital terrestrial television|Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting]] (DTTB) services using ISDB-T started in Japan in December 2003 and in Brazil in December 2007 as a trial. Since then, many countries have adopted ISDB over other digital broadcasting standards.

==Introduction==
[[File:Digital broadcast standards.svg|thumb|400px|right|DTT broadcasting systems. Countries using ISDB are shown in green.]]

ISDB is maintained by the Japanese organization [[ARIB]]. The [[Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting#Standards|standards]] can be obtained for free at the Japanese organization [[DiBEG]] website and at ARIB.

The core standards of ISDB are [[Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting#ISDB-S|ISDB-S]] (satellite television), [[Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting#ISDB-T|ISDB-T]] (terrestrial), [[Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting#ISDB-C|ISDB-C]] (cable) and [[#2.6&amp;nbsp;GHz Mobile satellite digital audio/video broadcasting|2.6&amp;nbsp;GHz band mobile broadcasting]] which are all based on [[MPEG-2]] or [[MPEG-4]] standard for multiplexing with transport stream structure and video and audio coding (MPEG-2 or H.264), and are capable of high definition television ([[High-definition television|HDTV]]) and standard definition television. [[Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting#ISDB-T|ISDB-T]] and [[Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting#ISDB-Tsb|ISDB-Tsb]] are for mobile reception in TV bands. [[1seg]] is the name of an ISDB-T service for reception on [[cell phones]], [[laptop computers]] and [[vehicles]].

The concept was named for its similarity to [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]], because both allow multiple channels of data to be transmitted together (a process called multiplexing). This is also much like another [[digital radio]] system, [[Eureka 147]], which calls each group of stations on a transmitter an [[DAB ensemble|ensemble]]; this is very much like the multi-channel digital TV standard [[DVB-T]]. ISDB-T operates on unused TV channels, an approach taken by other countries for TV but never before for radio.

===Transmission===
The various flavors of ISDB differ mainly in the modulations used, due to the requirements of different frequency bands. The 12&amp;nbsp;GHz band ISDB-S uses [[Phase-shift keying|PSK]] modulation, 2.6&amp;nbsp;GHz band digital sound broadcasting uses [[Code division multiplexing|CDM]], and ISDB-T (in [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and/or [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] band) uses [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|COFDM]] with [[Phase-shift keying|PSK]]/[[Quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]].

===Interaction===
Besides audio and video transmission, ISDB also defines data connections (Data broadcasting) with the internet as a return channel over several media (10Base-T/100Base-T, Telephone line modem, Mobile phone, Wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11) etc.) and with different protocols. 
This is used, for example, for interactive interfaces like data broadcasting ([[ARIB STD-B24]]) and electronic program guides (EPG).

===Interfaces and Encryption===
The ISDB specification describes a lot of (network) interfaces, but most importantly the Common Interface for Conditional Access System (CAS). While ISDB has examples of implementing various kinds of CASes, in Japan CAS called "B-CAS" is used. (ARIB STD-B25) defines the [[Common Scrambling Algorithm]] (CSA) system called [[MULTI2]] required for (de-)scrambling television.

The ISDB CAS system in Japan is operated by a company named ''B-CAS''; the CAS card is called ''B-CAS card''. The Japanese ISDB signal is always encrypted by the B-CAS system even if it is a free television program. That is why it is commonly called "Pay per view system without charge".{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} An interface for mobile reception is under consideration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

ISDB supports RMP (Rights management and protection). Since all digital television (DTV) systems carry digital data content, a [[DVD]] or high-definition (HD) recorder could easily copy content losslessly.
[[Hollywood]] requested copy protection; this was the main reason for RMP being mandated. The content has three modes: “copy once”, “copy free” and “copy never”. In “copy once” mode, a program can be stored on a hard disk recorder, but cannot be further copied; only moved to another copy-protected media—and this move operation will mark the content “copy one generation”, which is mandated to permanently prevent further copying. “Copy never” programming may only be [[Time shifting|timeshifted]] and cannot be permanently stored. In 2006&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, the Japanese government is evaluating using the [[Digital Transmission Content Protection]] (DTCP) "Encryption plus Non-Assertion" mechanism, to allow making multiple copies of digital content between compliant devices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://feed.japan.cnet.com/news/com/story/0,2000056021,20094312,00.htm JEITA、地デジのコンテンツ保護策として暗号方式 EPN を提案:ニュース - CNET Japan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Receiver==
There are two types of ISDB receiver: [[Television set|Television]] and [[set-top box]]. The aspect ratio of an ISDB-receiving television set is 16:9; televisions fulfilling these specs are called ''Hi-Vision TV''. There are four TV types: [[Cathode ray tube]] (CRT), [[Plasma display|plasma display panel]] (PDP), [[OLED|organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED) and [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD), with LCD being the most popular ''Hi-Vision TV'' on the Japanese market nowadays. The cheapest 32-inch LCD is ¥27,800 (approx. 360 US$) and 22-inch for ¥17,970 (approx. $233 US) for retail price as of November 2011.

The LCD share as measured by [[JEITA]] in November 2004 was about 60%. While PDP sets occupy the high end market with units that are over 50&amp;nbsp;inches (1270&amp;nbsp;mm), PDP and CRT set shares are about 20% each. CRT sets are considered low end for Hi-Vision. An STB is sometimes referred to as a digital tuner.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Typical middle to high-end ISDB receivers marketed in Japan have several interfaces:

* [[F connector]]s for RF input.
* [[HDMI]] or [[D4 video connector|D4 connector]] for [[High-definition television|HDTV]] a monitor in [[home cinema]].
* [[TOSLINK|Optical digital audio interface]] for an audio amplifier and speakers for [[Surround sound|5.1 surround audio]] in a home cinema.
* [[FireWire|IEEE 1394]] (aka FireWire) interface for digital data recorders (like [[DVD]] recorders) in a home cinema.
* [[RCA jack|RCA video jack]] provides [[SDTV]] signal that is sampled down from the HDTV signal for analog CRT television sets or [[VCR]]s.
* [[RCA jack|RCA audio jacks]] provide [[stereophonic sound|stereo audio]] for analog CRT television sets or [[VCR]]s.
* [[S-Video|S video]] is for [[VCR]]s or analog CRT television sets.
* [[10BASE-T]]/[[100BASE-T]] and modular jack telephone line [[Modem#Narrowband|modem]] interfaces are for an internet connection.
* B-CAS card interface to de-scramble.
* [[Infrared#Applications|IR]] interface jack for controlling a VHS or DVD player.

==Copy-protection technology==
All TV broadcasters in Japan is encrypted with ''Copy-Once'', which allows users to record to a digital medium ([[D-VHS]], DVD, HDD, etc.) but does not allow dubbing to another digital medium. On the other hand, the "Copy-Once" technology does not prohibit all types of dubbing. It is possible to dub to an analog medium (such as standard VHS) and if recorded to an HDD, it will allow users to "Move" the contents to a D-VHS, but not copy. In contrast, [[1seg]] digital broadcasts which are for low-bandwidth mobile reception and occupy 1/13th of a digital channel, are transmitted "in the clear" and do not carry copy protection information.

Many users are also very worried about the recent news of severe protection in the future.
There are modes in ISDB that do not allow the output of signal from an Analog connector (D-connector, [[Component video|Component]], [[Composite video|Composite]], [[S-Video]], etc.). There are already plans to not allow analog output for "Copyright Protection" reasons. (Same as [[Blu-ray]] and [[HD DVD]]) This will make all currently sold STB Tuners, and the majority of LCD/Plasma TVs without HDMI inputs unusable. Plus all analog VHS, D-VHS that can only record via analog input, and all DVD players will also become unusable. These more limiting copy protection technologies will all start after analog broadcasting ends (when there won't be any choice for viewers). Currently, no financial assistance schemes have been announced, and viewers without proper devices will be forced to buy a new compatible TV or set top box in order to view ISDB broadcasts. Though not clear, it is said that there are also plans to protect all programs with "Copy-Never".

The copy protection on ISDB broadcasts can be circumvented with the proper hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pbx.mine.nu/isdb/b-cas/ Software B-CAS Conditional Access Module with MULTI2 decoder&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian standard ISDB-Tb does not implement this copy protection mechanism. For other countries, there are some examples of implementing CAS system (such as verimatrix) by the operators' choice.

===B-CAS card===
The [[B-CAS]] card is required to decode all broadcasts in Japan. These cards are included with every digital TV or tuner at no charge. To use this card, the end user must agree to the statement written on the registration card. Despite the fact that the card must be inserted to watch TV, if the end user refuses to accept the terms/conditions contained within the statement, the user cannot watch digital broadcasts. Essentially, users are "forced" to agree with the statement. Though registration is not required, it is recommended to fully enjoy interactive programs. Unregistered B-CAS card displays a [[watermark]] in a corner of the screen, suggesting the user to register. However, many viewers worry about the leaking of personal information, and the power/rights the TV stations have to access personal information for almost every citizen in Japan. In case of loss or destruction, new B-CAS card of the same number can be issued for a fee of 2,000 [[Japanese yen|yen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=B-CAS＊各種手続き＊ |url=http://www.b-cas.co.jp/ |accessdate=2007-09-01 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
Typical Japanese broadcast service consists as follows:
# One HDTV or up to three SDTV services within one channel.
# Provides [[data broadcasting]].
# Interactive services such as games or shopping, via telephone line or broadband internet.
# Equipped with an [[electronic program guide]].
# Ability to send firmware patches for the TV/tuner over the air.

There are examples providing more than 10 SDTV services with H.264 coding in some countries.

==ISDB-S==

===History===
Japan started digital broadcasting using the DVB-S standard by PerfecTV in October/1996, and DirecTV in December/1997, with communication satellites. Still, DVB-S did not satisfy the requirements of Japanese broadcasters, such as [[NHK]], key commercial broadcasting stations like [[Nippon Television]], [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]], [[Fuji Television]], [[TV Asahi|TV asahi]], [[TV Tokyo]], and [[WOWOW]] (Movie-only Pay-TV broadcasting). Consequently, [[ARIB]] developed the ISDB-S standards. The requirements were HDTV capability, interactive services, network access and effective frequency utilization, and other technical requirements. The DVB-S standard allows the transmission of a bit stream of roughly 34 Mbit/s with a satellite transponder, which means the transponder can send one HDTV channel. Unfortunately, the NHK broadcasting satellite had only four vacant transponders, which led ARIB and NHK to develop ISDB-S: The new standard could transmit at 51 Mbit/s with a single transponder, which means that ISDB-S is 1.5 times more efficient than DVB-S and that one transponder can transmit two HDTV channels, along with other independent audio and data. Digital satellite broadcasting (BS digital) was started by NHK and followed commercial broadcasting stations on 1 December 2000. Today, [[SKY PerfecTV!]], successor of Skyport TV, and Sky D, CS burn, Platone, EP, DirecTV, J Sky B, and PerfecTV!, adopted the ISDB-S system for use on the 110 degree (east longitude) wide-band communication satellite.

==ISDB-T==

===History===
HDTV was invented at [[NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories]] (Japan Broadcasting Corporation's Science &amp; Technical Research Laboratories). The research for HDTV started as early as the 1960s, though a standard was proposed to the ITU-R (CCIR) only in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.library.cmu.edu/portal/main.jsp?flag=browse&amp;smd=1&amp;awdid=3|title=ArchivalWare &gt;&gt;Login|website=digitalcollections.library.cmu.edu|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, a high definition television camera, cathode-ray tube, video tape recorder and editing equipment, among others, had been developed. In 1982 NHK developed MUSE (Multiple sub-nyquist sampling Encoding), the first HDTV video compression and transmission system. [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]] used digital video compression, but for transmission [[frequency modulation]] was used after a digital-to-analog converter converted the digital signal.

In 1987, NHK demonstrated MUSE in Washington D.C. and NAB. The demonstration made a great impression in the U.S. As a result, the U.S. developed its own [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] terrestrial DTV system. Europe also developed their own DTV system called [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]. Japan began R&amp;D of a completely digital system in the 1980s that led to ISDB. Japan began terrestrial digital broadcasting, using ISDB-T standard by NHK and commercial broadcasting stations, on 1 December 2003.

===Features===
[[File:ISDB-T CH Seg Prog allocation.svg|thumb|250px|Treeview of ISDB-T, channels, Segments and arranging multiple program broadcasting.]]

ISDB-T is characterized by the following features:

* ISDB-T (Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting-Terrestrial) in Japan use [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] 470&amp;nbsp;MHz-770&amp;nbsp;MHz, bandwidth of 300&amp;nbsp;MHz, allocate 50 channels, namely ch.13-ch.62, each channel is 6&amp;nbsp;MHz width (actually 5.572&amp;nbsp;MHz effective bandwidth and 430&amp;nbsp;kHz guard band between channels). These channels are called "physical channel(物理チャンネル)". For other countries, US channel table or European channel table are used.
* For channel tables with 6&amp;nbsp;MHz width, ISDB-T single channel bandwidths 5.572&amp;nbsp;MHz has number of carriers 5,617 with interval of 0.99206&amp;nbsp;kHz. For 7&amp;nbsp;MHz channel, channel bandwidth is 6.50&amp;nbsp;MHz; for 8&amp;nbsp;MHz 7.42&amp;nbsp;MHz.
* ISDB-T allows to accommodate any combination of HDTV (roughly 8Mbit/s in H.264) and SDTV (roughly 2Mbit/s in H.264) within the given bitrate determined by the transmission parameters such as bandwidth, code-rate, guard interval, etc. Typically, among the 13 segments, the center segment is used for [[1seg]] with QPSK modulation and the remaining 12 segments for the HDTV or SDTV payloads for 64QAM modulation. The bitstream of the 12 segments are combined into one transport stream, within which any combination of programs can be carried based on the MPEG-2 transport stream definition.
* ISDB-T transmits a [[High-definition television|HDTV]] channel and a mobile TV channel '''[[1seg]]''' within one channel. 1seg is a mobile terrestrial digital audio/video broadcasting service in Japan. Although 1seg is designed for mobile usage, reception is sometimes problematic in moving vehicles. Because of reception on high speed vehicle, [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] transmission is shaded by buildings and hills frequently, but reported well receiving in [[Shinkansen]] as far as run in flat or rural area.
* ISDB-T provides interactive services with data broadcasting. Such as [[Electronic program guide|Electronic Program Guides]]. ISDB-T supports internet access as a [[return channel]] that works to support the data broadcasting. Internet access is also provided on mobile phones.
* ISDB-T provides [[Single Frequency Network]] (SFN) and [[on-channel repeater]] technology. SFN makes efficient utilization of the frequency resource (spectrum). For example, the Kanto area (greater Tokyo area including most part of Tokyo prefecture and some part of Chiba, Ibaragi, Tochigi, Saitama and Kanagawa prefecture) are covered with SFN with roughly 10 million population coverage.
* ISDB-T can be received indoors with a simple [[indoor antenna]].
* ISDB-T provides robustness to [[multipath interference]] ("ghosting"), [[Co-channel interference|co-channel analog television interference]], and [[electromagnetic interference]]s that come from motor vehicles and power lines in urban environments.
* ISDB-T is claimed to allow HDTV to be received on moving vehicles at over 100&amp;nbsp;km/h; [[DVB-T]] can only receive [[SDTV]] on moving vehicles, and it is claimed that [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] can not be received on moving vehicles at all (however, in early 2007 there were reports of successful reception of ATSC on laptops using USB tuners in moving vehicles).

===Adoption===
ISDB-T was adopted for commercial transmissions in Japan in December 2003. It currently comprises a market of about 100 million television sets. ISDB-T had 10 million subscribers by the end of April 2005. Along with the wide use of ISDB-T, the price of receivers is getting low. The price of ISDB-T STB in the lower end of the market is ¥19800 as of 19 April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/av/docs/20060330/uniden3.htm uniden ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709074636/http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/av/docs/20060330/uniden3.htm |date=2007-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 2007 only a few older, low-end STB models could be found in the Japanese market (average price U$180), showing a tendency towards replacement by mid to high-end equipment like PVRs and TV sets with inbuilt tuners. In November 2009, a retail chain [[Æon (company)|AEON]] introduced STB in 40 USD,&lt;ref&gt;http://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/20090904_313051.html&lt;/ref&gt; followed by variety of low-cost tuners. The Dibeg web page confirms this tendency by showing low significance of the digital tuner STB market in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dibeg.org/news/news-5/news-e5.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114023735/http://www.dibeg.org/news/news-5/news-e5.htm#dn068e |archive-date=2007-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brazil]], which currently uses an [[broadcast television system|analogue TV system]] (PAL-M) that slightly differs from any other countries, has chosen ISDB-T as a base for its [[digital television|DTV]] format, calling it [[ISDB-Tb]] or ''internally'' [[SBTVD]] (''Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão Digital-Terrestre''). The Japanese DiBEG group incorporated the advancements made by Brazil -[[H.264|MPEG4]] video codec instead of ISDB-T's MPEG2 and a powerful interaction middleware called [[Ginga (SBTVD Middleware)|Ginga]]- and has renamed the standard to "[[ISDB-T International]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dibeg.org/techp/feature/features_of_isdb-t.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809234123/http://www.dibeg.org/techp/feature/features_of_isdb-t.htm |archivedate=2009-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Chile and Ecuador&lt;ref name="blog.subtel.cl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.subtel.cl/wp/?p=105 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922192948/http://blog.subtel.cl/wp/?p=105 |archivedate=2009-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which have already selected ISDB-Tb, there are other South American countries, mainly from [[Mercosur]], such as Venezuela,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telesintese.ig.com.br/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13284{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; that are considering ISDB-Tb, which could provide economies of scale and common market benefits from the regional South American manufacturing instead of importing ready-made STBs as is the case with the other standards. Also, it has been confirmed with extensive tests realized by Brazilian Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters (ABERT), Brazilian Television Engineering Society (SET) and [[Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie]] the insufficient quality for indoor reception presented by ATSC and, between DVB-T and ISDB-T, the latter presented superior performance in indoor reception and flexibility to access digital services and TV programs through non-mobile, mobile or portable receivers with impressive quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.set.com.br/artigos/nab.pps |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928163814/http://www.set.com.br/artigos/nab.pps |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABERT–SET group in Brazil did system comparison tests of DTV under the supervision of the [[CPqD]] foundation. The comparison tests were done under the direction of a work group of SET and [[ABERT]]. The ABERT/SET group selected ISDB-T as the best choice in digital broadcasting modulation systems among ATSC, DVB-T and ISDB-T.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Another study found that ISDB-T and DVB-T performed similarly, and that both were outperformed by [[DVB-T2]].&lt;ref&gt;Julian Clover [http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2010/11/02/dvb-t-far-superior-to-isdb-dvb-t2-beats-them-both/ ''DVB-T far superior to ISDB, DVB-T2 beats them both''], in ''broadbandtvnews'' November 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

ISDB-T was singled out as the most flexible of all for meeting the needs of mobility and portability. It is most efficient for mobile and portable reception. On June 29, 2006, Brazil announced ISDB-T-based SBTVD as the chosen standard for digital TV transmissions, to be fully implemented by 2016. By November 2007 (one month prior DTTV launch), a few suppliers started to announce zapper STBs of the new Nippon-Brazilian SBTVD-T standard, at that time without interactivity.

The implementation rollout in Brazil is proceeding successfully although some voice like Philips' say&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1023731/brazil-defends-isdb-t-choice]&lt;/ref&gt; that its implementation could be faster. It terms of broadcasting, the implementation plan seems to be on target. In only eight months since the start, the digital signal is present in four state capitals and by the end of 2008 another three capitals will receive the signal. In terms of end-customers the implementation could be better, since at the moment it is estimated{{By whom|date=July 2009}} only 20,000 set-top boxes have been sold. Part of this low sales number can be explained by the prices that in the beginning ranged from [[Brazilian real|BRL]] 600 to BRL 1,100. However, recently new set-top boxes were launched in market at R$300 (approx US$150) that will probably increase set-top box sales. Another reason to explain low sales level is the interactivity service not available yet. That is because the "middleware" developed by Brazilian universities (PUC Rio and Federal University of Paraiba) was finished in October 2008. It is expected{{By whom|date=July 2009}} the interactivity will be a strong appeal bringing more and more people to digital TV world.

Additionally, mobile TV started successfully with the launch of Samsung and Toshiba cell phones with ISDB-T "one-seg" tuners. Its main appeal is that the service is free. That is a very impressive accomplishment in a short period since Brazil launched its digital mobile TV for free. In other countries such accomplishment occurred years later, and in others like the U.S. and Europe this is far from reality and probably won't be for free {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}.&lt;ref name="rapidtvnews.com"&gt;http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/200810072274/german-dvb-h-declared-a-failure.html&lt;/ref&gt; Subscription mobile TV in Germany using DVB-H has been dubbed "a failure".&lt;ref name="rapidtvnews.com"/&gt; In Italy the cost of receiving mobile TV over DVB-H costs the user €9.90 per month just for the basic channel package.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dvb-h.org/Services/services-Italy-vodafone.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical specification===
''' Segment structure '''

ARIB has developed a segment structure called [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing#BST-OFDM used in ISDB|BST-OFDM]] (see figure).
ISDB-T divides the frequency band of one channel into thirteen segments. The broadcaster can select which combination of segments to use; this choice of segment structure allows for service flexibility. For example, ISDB-T can transmit both [[LDTV]] and HDTV using one TV channel or change to 3 SDTV, a switch that can be performed at any time. ISDB-T can also change the modulation scheme at the same time.

==ISDB-Tsb==
ISDB-Tsb is the '''t'''errestrial digital '''s'''ound '''b'''roadcasting specification. The technical specification is the same as ISDB-T. ISDB-Tsb supports the [[COFDM|coded transmission of OFDM siginals]].

==ISDB-C==
ISDB-C is cable digital broadcasting specification. The technical specification J.83/C is developed by [[JCTEA]]. ISDB-C is identical to DVB-C but has a different channel bandwidth of 6MHz (instead of 8MHz) and roll-off factor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dvb.org/news/dvb_c2-in-japan&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISDB-Tmm==
ISDB-Tmm ('''T'''errestrial '''m'''obile '''m'''ulti-media) utilised suitable number of segments by station with video coding MPEG-4 AVC/H.264. With multiple channels, ISDB-Tmm served dedicated channels such as sport, movie, music channels and others with [[CD]] quality sound, allowing for better broadcast quality as compared to [[1seg]]. This service used the [[VHF]] band, 207.5–222&amp;nbsp;MHz which began to be utilised after Japan's [[Digital television transition |switchover to digital television]] in July 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7055">[[File:Inverted pyramid 2.svg|thumb|400px|The inverted pyramid method visualised]]
The '''inverted pyramid''' is a [[metaphor]] used by [[journalist]]s and other writers to illustrate how information should be prioritized and structured in a text (e.g., a news report). It is a common method for writing [[news style|news stories]] (and has adaptability to other kinds of texts, e.g., blogs and editorial columns). This is a way to communicate the basics about a news report in the initial sentences. It is widely taught to [[mass communication]] and journalism students, and is systematically used in Anglophone media.

The inverted or upside-down pyramid can be thought of as a triangle with one side horizontally at the top and the body pointing down. The widest part at the top represents the most substantial, interesting, and important information that the writer means to convey, illustrating that this kind of material should head the article, while the tapering lower portion illustrates that other material should follow in order of diminishing importance.

It is sometimes called a '''summary news lead''' style,&lt;ref name=errico /&gt; or '''bottom line up front''' ([[BLUF (communication)|BLUF]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Being Direct 1: Martin Krieger's Bottom Line Up Front |url=http://sites.google.com/site/writingmatterssite/Home/being-direct-1-bottom-line-up-front}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The opposite, the failure to mention the most important, interesting or attention-grabbing elements of a story in the opening paragraphs, is called ''[[burying the lead]]''.

==Purpose==
Other styles are also used in news writing, including the "anecdotal lead", which begins the story with an eye-catching tale or [[anecdote]] rather than the central facts; and the [[FAQ|Q&amp;A]], or question-and-answer format. The inverted pyramid may also include a "hook" as a kind of prologue, typically a provocative quote, question, or image, to entice the reader into committing to the story.

This format is valued for two reasons. First, readers can leave the story at any point and understand it, even if they do not have all the details. Second, it conducts readers through the details of the story.

This system also means that information less vital to the reader's understanding comes later in the story, where it is easier to edit out for space or other reasons. This is called "cutting from the bottom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/735/04/ |title=The Inverted Pyramid Structure |work=[[Purdue Online Writing Lab]] |date=2013-04-06 |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than petering out, a story may end with a "[[News style#Kicker|kicker]]" – a conclusion, perhaps call to action – which comes ''after'' the pyramid. This is particularly common in [[feature style]].

==History==
Historians disagree about when the form was created. Many say the [[electrical telegraph|invention of the telegraph]] sparked its development by encouraging reporters to condense material, to reduce costs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poynter.org/news/media-innovation/12755/birth-of-the-inverted-pyramid-a-child-of-technology-commerce-and-history/|title="Birth of Inverted Pyramid"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to hedge against the unreliability of the telegraph network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/40d7/4f28b7f5336570820b89b7c9ba27497b8473.pdf |title=Web journalism |last= Canavilhas|first=Joao |date= |website=pdfs.semanticscholar.org|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of 19th-century news stories in American newspapers, however, suggest that the form spread several decades later than the telegraph, possibly because the reform era's social and educational forces encouraged factual reporting rather than more interpretive narrative styles.&lt;ref name="errico"&gt;{{cite web|last=Errico|first=Marcus|url=http://www.scripps.ohiou.edu/mediahistory/mhmjour1-1.htm|title=The evolution of the summary news lead.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chip Scanlan's essay on the form&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scanlan|first=Chip|url=http://www.poynter.org/2003/birth-of-the-inverted-pyramid-a-child-of-technology-commerce-and-history/12755/|title=An examination of the inverted pyramid|publisher=Poynter Institute|date=2003-06-23|accessdate=2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes this frequently cited example of telegraphic reporting:

{{quotation|This evening at about 9:30 p.m. at [[Ford's Theatre]], the [[Abraham Lincoln|President]], while sitting in his private box with [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mrs. Lincoln]], [[Clara Harris|Mrs. Harris]] and [[Henry Rathbone|Major Rathburn]], was shot by an assassin, who suddenly entered the box and approached behind the President.

The assassin then leaped upon the stage, brandishing a large dagger or knife, and made his escape in the rear of the theatre.

The pistol ball entered the back of the President's head and penetrated nearly through the head. The wound is mortal.

The President has been insensible ever since it was inflicted, and is now dying.

About the same hour an assassin, whether the same or not, entered [[William H. Seward|Mr. Seward]]'s apartment and under pretense of having a prescription was shown to the Secretary’s sick chamber. The assassin immediately rushed to the bed and inflicted two or three stabs on the chest and two on the face.
It is hoped the wounds may not be mortal. My apprehension is that they will prove fatal.

The nurse alarmed Mr. [[Frederick W. Seward|Frederick Seward]], who was in an adjoining rented room, and he hastened to the door of his father’s room, when he met the assassin, who inflicted upon him one or more dangerous wounds. The recovery of Frederick Seward is doubtful.

It is not probable that the President will live through the night.

[[Ulysses S. Grant|General Grant]] and his wife were advertised to be at the theatre...|''[[New York Herald]]''|April 15, 1865}}

[[Five Ws|Who, when, where, why, what, and how]] are addressed in the first paragraph. As the article continues, the less important details are presented. An even more pyramid-conscious reporter or editor would move two additional details to the first two sentences: That the shot was to the head, and that it was expected to prove fatal. The transitional sentence about the Grants suggests that less-important facts are being added to the rest of the story.

Other news outlets such as the [[Associated Press]] did not use this format when covering the assassination, instead adopting a chronological organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Izadi|first1=Elahi|title=How newspapers covered Abraham Lincoln’s assassination 150 years ago|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2015/04/14/how-newspapers-covered-abraham-lincolns-assassination-150-years-ago/?tid=sm_fb|accessdate=14 April 2015|work=[[Washington Post]] Style Blog|date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. '''Israel Isidor Elyashev''' (1873&amp;ndash;1924) was a [[Jew]]ish [[Neurology|neurologist]] and the first [[Yiddish]] literary critic.
He introduced the world to the works of the great contemporary Yiddish classical writers:  [[Sholem Rabinovich]], better known as [[Sholem Aleichem]], [[Mendele Mocher Sefarim]], [[Isaac Leib Peretz]] and [[Nachum Sokolov]]; along with modern Hebrew writers including [[Chaim Nachman Bialik]], and [[Sholem Asch]], among several others.

Elyashev was originally from [[Kaunas]], Lithuania.  In his youth, he studied with Rabbi [[Simcha Zissel Ziv]] at the Talmud Torah in [[Grobiņa]], Latvia, but was eventually expelled from the school for his "heretical tendencies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Bal-Makhshoves ''Bal-Makhshoves'', YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;  He went on to attend a high school in Switzerland, and he then studied medicine and biology in Heidelberg and Berlin.

Elyashev's pen name was '''Bal-Makhshoves''' ({{lang-he|בעל מחשבות}}), meaning "Master [of] Thoughts" or "The Thinker".

Elyashev is best known for his work as a literary critic, writing in Yiddish.  He translated [[Theodor Herzl]]'s ''[[Altneuland]]'' from [[German language|German]] into Yiddish, upon Herzl's personal request.  His Yiddish translation of Herzl's work is the language that by far- most of European Jewry had read of Herzl's calling for a Modern Jewish State.

His attitude to Jewish literature, Yiddish, and Hebrew is summed up by something that he wrote in 1918:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e have two languages and a dozen echoes from other foreign languages, but… we have only one literature. And therefore the reader who seeks to become acquainted with the currents of Jewish life, to comprehend the spirit of the Jewish individual and multitude and how they find expression in Jewish literature, that reader does not separate Hebrew writers from Yiddish ones. …All are representatives of our literature, all embody a piece of Jewish life in their writings; all of them are Jewish artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hagshama.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1388 The Great Jewish Language War&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212010821/http://www.hagshama.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1388 |date=2004-12-12 }} at www.hagshama.org.il&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elyashev was also politically active, as a forerunner of the [[Zionism|Zionist Movement]].  He participated in the [[First Zionist Congress]], held in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] in August 1897, as a delegate from [[Germany]] .

'''John Richard Perry''' (born 1943) is Henry Waldgrave Stuart Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at [[Stanford University]] and Distinguished Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the [[University of California, Riverside]]. He has made significant contributions to philosophy in the fields of [[philosophy of language]], [[metaphysics]], and [[philosophy of mind]]. He is known primarily for his work on [[situation semantics]] (together with [[Jon Barwise]]), [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]], [[indexicality]], [[personal identity]], and [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]].

==Life and career==
John Perry was born in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] on January 16, 1943. He received his B.A. in philosophy from [[Doane College]] in 1964 and his Ph.D. in philosophy from [[Cornell University]] in 1968 under the supervision of [[Sydney Shoemaker]]. He taught philosophy at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], before joining the faculty at [[Stanford University]] where he is Henry Waldgrave Professor of Philosophy Emeritus.   He subsequently taught at the [[University of California, Riverside]], where he is now Distinguished Professor of Philosophy Emeritus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.ucr.edu/john-perry/ University of California, Riverside, Department of Philosophy Faculty Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded the [[Jean Nicod Prize]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Biographical details from John Perry's ''curriculum vitae'', https://web.archive.org/web/20110629220034/http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~jperry//vita/vita.html.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://humsci.stanford.edu/faculty/awards/academy_arts_sciences American Academy of Arts and Sciences - School of Humanities and Sciences&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311022715/http://humsci.stanford.edu/faculty/awards/academy_arts_sciences |date=2016-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40104 |title=Gruppe 3: Idéfag |publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=16 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109221405/http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40104 |archivedate= 9 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, he became co-host, with [[Kenneth Allen Taylor|Kenneth Taylor]], of ''[[Philosophy Talk]],'' the radio program that "questions everything... except your intelligence." He is also part of the Center for the Study of Language and Information ([[Stanford University centers and institutes#Center_for_the_Study_of_Language_and_Information|CSLI]])&amp;mdash;an independent research center founded in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-csli.stanford.edu/ CSLI Center for the Study of Language and Information - Stanford University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
Perry has made contributions to many areas of philosophy, including [[logic]], [[philosophy of language]], [[metaphysics]], and [[philosophy of mind]].

Perry's 1978 book ''[[A Dialogue on Personal Identity and Immortality]]'' deals with standard problems in the theory of [[personal identity]] in the form of a dialogue between a mortally wounded university professor, Gretchen Weirob, and her two friends, Sam Miller and Dave Cohen. The views represented include those of [[Bernard Williams]], [[John Locke]], and [[Derek Parfit]]. The format of associating different philosophical positions with different characters in a dialogue recalls [[David Hume]]'s ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''.

In 1979, Perry published "The Problem of the Essential Indexical" in which he combined his work on philosophy of language and philosophy of mind. Essential indexicals (I, here, and now) are parts of language that cannot be paraphrased away. They are seen as locating beliefs and are essential to understand the speaker's belief. Perry presents a now famous example to illustrate his point:

"I once followed a trail of sugar on a supermarket floor, pushing my cart down the aisle on one side of a tall counter and back the aisle on the other, seeking the shopper with the torn sack to tell him he was making a mess. With each trip around the counter, the trail became thicker. But I seemed unable to catch up. Finally it dawned on me. I was the shopper I was trying to catch."

In this example, the pronoun "I" is essentially indexical because it allowed Perry to realize that it was he himself making the mess. This realization caused him to change his behavior. Essential indexicals create the impetus for action. They cannot be paraphrased away while retaining their immediacy. If Perry were to say "Perry realized that Perry was making a mess", it would still not be essentially indexical because Perry would still have to understand that he himself is Perry. Without that extra step, there would be no reason for him to change his action. "I" is the only essential indexical in that situation.

In logic, Perry and [[Jon Barwise]] are known for discussion of the [[slingshot argument]], especially in their 1981 article "Semantic Innocence and Uncompromising Situations".

In his 2001 book ''Knowledge, Possibility and Consciousness'', Perry argues for what he calls "antecedent physicalism", according to which [[physicalism]] is antecedently taken to be a plausible and reasonable position, provided that there are no better rival theories. Thus, Perry defends a version of [[type physicalism]] against three major philosophical arguments for [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]: the [[Philosophical zombie|zombie argument]], the [[Mary's Room|knowledge argument]], and the [[Saul Kripke|modal argument]].

Perry also produces non-technical work that reaches a wider audience, such as his humorous 1996 online essay entitled "Structured Procrastination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-ProcrastinateStill/93959|title=How to Procrastinate and Still Get Things Done|last=Perry|first=John|authorlink=John Perry (philosopher)|date=February 23, 1996|website=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218090944/http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-ProcrastinateStill/93959|archive-date=February 18, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perry was awarded an [[List of Ig Nobel Prize winners#2011|Ig Nobel Prize in Literature]] for this essay in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Winners of the 2011 Ig Nobel Awards, http://articles.boston.com/2011-09-29/news/30218720_1_throwers-ig-nobel-awards-improbable-research{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chronicle.com/article/10-Ig-Nobels-Awarded-/129224/ | title=15 Years After an Essay on Procrastination, a Philosopher Wins an Ig Nobel (&amp; his reaction) | publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date=September 29, 2011 | accessdate=November 3, 2011 | author=Troop, Don}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that "[t]o be a high achiever, always work on something important, using it as a way to avoid doing something that's even more important".

==Overview==
''L'Année philologique'' aims to be the most comprehensive international resource for Ancient Greece and Rome. Entries on journal articles are often accompanied by a very brief [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]] that may be in a language other than that of the original. Abstracts are most often in [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. No abstracts for books are provided, but entries on books include a listing of published [[review]]s. Indexing often lags publication by two or three years.&lt;ref name="UQ" /&gt;

Because ''L'Année philologique'' is an index, not a collection, searches find terms only within the bibliographical entry, not the full text of the article (the "full text" search option refers to the contents of ''L'Année philologique''). The electronic edition offers a variety of search parameters, with some idiosyncrasies.&lt;ref name="UQ" /&gt; Since September 2018, the database is available for library subscription via the commercial publisher [[Brepols Publishers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://about.brepolis.net/lannee-philologique-aph/|title=L'Année philologique|publisher=About BREPOL''i''S|accessdate=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2013 and 2018, access was provided by another publisher, [[EBSCO Publishing|EBSCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebscohost.com/academic/lannee-philologique|title=L'Année philologique via EBSCOhost|publisher=EBSCO|accessdate=Jan 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''L'Année philologique'' is published by the Société Internationale de Bibliographie Classique with support from the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS) of [[France]] and several other institutions. Editorial offices are located in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]]; [[Heidelberg]], Germany; [[Lausanne]], Switzerland; [[Genoa]], Italy; and [[Granada|Grenada]], Spain. It was founded in [[Paris]] by the [[latin]]ist Jules Marouzeau (1878-1964), Professor at the [[Sorbonne]].&lt;ref name="APh" /&gt;

To fill the gap between ''L'Année philologique'' and earlier bibliographies, Marouzeau arranged for the publication of a series of volumes in the same format:
* J. Marouzeau, ''Dix années de bibliographie classique : bibliographie critique et analytique de l'Antiquité gréco-latine pour la période 1914-1924'' (2 vols). Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1927-1928.

The '''languages of [[Taiwan]]''' consist of several varieties of languages under families of [[Austronesian languages]] and [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] spoken in [[Taiwan]]. The [[Formosan languages]], a branch of [[Austronesian languages]], have been spoken by the [[Taiwanese aborigines]] in [[Taiwan]] for thousands of years. Researches on [[historical linguistics]] recognize Taiwan as the [[Urheimat]] (homeland) of the whole [[Austronesian languages]] family owing to the highest internal variety of the [[Formosan languages]]. In the last 400 years, several waves of [[Chinese emigration]]s brought several different [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] into Taiwan, these languages include [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]], and [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]]. These became the major languages of today's Taiwan, and make Taiwan an important center of [[Hokkien pop]] and [[Mandopop]]. 

[[Formosan languages]] were the dominant language of the [[Prehistory of Taiwan]]. The long colonial and immigration [[history of Taiwan]] brought in several languages such as [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Hokkien]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. Due to its colonial history, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is also spoken and a large amount of loanwords from Japanese still exists in several languages of Taiwan.

[[History of Taiwan since 1945|After World War II]], a long [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law era]] was held in [[Taiwan]]. Policies of the government in this era suppressed languages other than [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]] in public use. This has significantly damaged the evolution of local languages including [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]], [[Formosan languages]] and [[Matsu dialect]]. The situation has slightly changed after the 2000s. The government has put some efforts to protect and revitalize local languages. Local languages is now a part of [[Education in Taiwan|elementary school education]] in [[Taiwan]]. Laws and regulations regarding local language protection were established for [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]] and [[Formosan languages]]. Public TV and radio stations exclusively for the two languages were also established. Currently, the government of Taiwan also maintains standards of several widely spoken languages listed below, the percentage of users are from the ''2010 population and household census in Taiwan''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stat.gov.tw/public/Attachment/21081884771.pdf 99年人口及住宅普查總報告統計結果提要分析]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Formosan languages}}

The '''Taiwanese indigenous languages''' or '''Formosan languages''' are the languages of the [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal tribes]] of [[Taiwan]]. Taiwanese aborigines currently comprise about 2.3% of the island's population.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Indigenous Peoples, Executive Yuan  ''[http://www.apc.gov.tw/en/statistic/number2.aspx "Statistics of Indigenous Population in Taiwan and Fukien Areas"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830083123/http://www.apc.gov.tw/en/statistic/number2.aspx |date=2006-08-30 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, far fewer can still speak their ancestral language, after centuries of [[language shift]]. It is common for young and middle-aged Hakka and aboriginal people to speak Mandarin and Hokkien better than, or to the exclusion of, their ethnic languages. Of the approximately 26 languages of the Taiwanese aborigines, at least ten are [[extinct language|extinct]], another five are [[moribund language|moribund]],&lt;ref&gt;Zeitoun, Elizabeth &amp;  Ching-Hua Yu ''[http://aclclp.org.tw/clclp/v10n2/v10n2a2.pdf "The Formosan Language Archive: Linguistic  Analysis and Language Processing"]''. Computational Linguistics and Chinese Language  Processing. Volume  10, No. 2, June 2005, pp. 167-200&lt;/ref&gt; and several others are to some degree  [[endangered languages|endangered]]. Currently the government recognized 16 languages and 42 accents of the indigenous languages, they are

The governmental agency — [[Council of Indigenous Peoples]] — maintains the orthography of the [[writing systems of Formosan languages]]. Due to the era of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule]], a large amount of [[loanword]]s from [[Japanese language]] also appears in Formosan languages. There is also [[Yilan Creole Japanese]] as a mixture of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Atayal language|Atayal]].

All Formosan languages are slowly being replaced by the culturally dominant Mandarin. In recent decades the government started an aboriginal reappreciation program that included the reintroduction of Formosan [[first language|mother tongue education]] in Taiwanese schools. However, the results of this initiative have been disappointing.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Hui-chi (2004). ''A Survey of Language Ability, Language Use and Language Attitudes of Young Aborigines in Taiwan.''

== Sinitic languages ==
=== Mandarin ===
{{Main|Taiwanese Mandarin|Standard Chinese}}
Mandarin is commonly known and officially referred to as the '''national language''' ({{lang|zh-tw|國語}}, ''Guóyǔ'') in [[Taiwan]]. In 1945, following the end of [[World War II]], Mandarin was introduced as the official language and made compulsory in schools. (Before 1945, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] was the official language and taught in schools.) Since then, Mandarin has been established as a [[lingua franca]] among the various groups in Taiwan: the majority [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]]-speaking [[Hoklo (ethnic group)|Hoklo]] (Hokkien), the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] who have their own [[Hakka Chinese|spoken language]],  the [[Taiwanese aboriginals|aboriginals]] who speak aboriginal languages, as well as [[Mainland Chinese]] immigrated in 1949 whose native tongue may be any [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese variant]].

People who emigrated from [[China]] after 1949 (12% of the population) mostly speak [[Mandarin Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liao |first=Silvie |date=2008 |url=http://naccl.osu.edu/files/21_liao-s.pdf |title=A Perceptual Dialect Study of Taiwan Mandarin: Language Attitudes in the Era of Political Battle |journal=Proceedings of the 20th North American Conference on Chinese Linguistics (NACCL-20) |volume=1 |place=Columbus, Ohio |publisher=The Ohio State University |oclc=895153060 |isbn=9780982471500 |ref=harv |page=393 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110315/http://naccl.osu.edu/files/21_liao-s.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]] is almost universally spoken and understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Republic of China Yearbook 2012 |date=2012 |publisher=Executive Yuan, R.O.C. (Taiwan) |chapter=Chapter 2: People and Language |chapterurl=http://www.ey.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=F4FA171B7E10F12F |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014222446/http://www.ey.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=F4FA171B7E10F12F |archivedate=2013-10-14 |accessdate=2013-12-18 |isbn=9789860345902 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only officially sanctioned medium of instruction in [[Education in Taiwan|schools in Taiwan]] from late 1940s to late 1970s, following the handover of [[Taiwan]] to the [[government of the Republic of China]] in 1945, until [[English language|English]] became a high school subject in the 1980s and local languages became a school subject in the 2000s.

Taiwanese Mandarin (as with [[Singlish]] and many other situations of a [[Post-creole speech continuum|creole speech community]]) is spoken at different levels according to the social class and situation of the speakers. Formal occasions call for the [[acrolect]]al level of Standard Chinese of [[Taiwan]] ({{lang|zh-tw|國語}}, ''Guóyǔ''), which differs little from the Standard Chinese of [[China]] ({{lang|zh-cn|普通话}}, ''Pǔtōnghuà''). Less formal situations may result in the [[basilect]] form, which has more uniquely Taiwanese features. Bilingual Taiwanese speakers may [[Code-switching|code-switch]] between Mandarin and Taiwanese, sometimes in the same sentence.

Mandarin is spoken fluently by almost the entire Taiwanese population, except for some elderly people who were educated under Japanese rule. In [[Taipei]], where there is a high concentration of [[Mainland Chinese]] whose native language is not Taiwanese, Mandarin is used in greater frequency than in southern Taiwan and more rural areas.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Many Taiwanese, particularly the younger generations, speak Mandarin better than Hakka or Hokkien.{{sfnp|Noble|2005|p=16}}

=== Taiwanese Hokkien ===
{{Main|Taiwanese Hokkien}}
Commonly known as '''Taiwanese''' ({{lang|zh-tw|臺語}}, ''Tâi-gí'') and officially referred as '''Taiwanese Hokkien''' ({{lang|zh-tw|臺灣閩南語}}, ''Tâi-oân Bân-lâm-gú''). [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] is the most-spoken native language in [[Taiwan]], spoken by about 70% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cheng |first=Robert L. |date=1994 |chapter=Chapter 13: Language Unification in Taiwan: Present and Future |page=362 |title=The Other Taiwan: 1945 to the Present |editor=Rubinstein, Murray |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |isbn=9781563241932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klöter |first=Henning |date=2004 |journal=China Perspectives |volume=56 |issn=1996-4617 |url=http://chinaperspectives.revues.org/442 |title=Language Policy in the KMT and DPP eras}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistically, it is a subgroup of [[Southern Min]] languages variety originating in southern [[Fujian]] and is spoken by many [[overseas Chinese]] throughout [[Southeast Asia]]. 

There are both colloquial and literary [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of Taiwanese. Colloquial Taiwanese has roots in [[Old Chinese]]. Literary Taiwanese, which was originally developed in the 10th century in Fujian and based on [[Middle Chinese]], was used at one time for formal writing, but is now largely extinct. Due to the era of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule]], a large amount of [[loanword]]s from [[Japanese language]] also appears in Taiwanese. The loanwords may be read in [[Kanji]] through Taiwanese pronunciation or simply use the Japanese pronunciation. These reasons makes the modern writing Taiwanese in a mixed script of [[traditional Chinese characters]] and Latin-based systems such as [[pe̍h-ōe-jī]] or [[Taiwanese Romanization System|Taiwanese romanization system]].  

Recent work by scholars such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20041022000504/http://ws.twl.ncku.edu.tw/hak-chia/l/lou-ek-ki/kongpah-oat.htm Ekki Lu], [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081002014759/http://203.64.42.21/iug/ungian/poj/siausit/2002/2002pojgth/lunbun/a1-sakai.pdf Sakai Toru], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20040915015640/http://ws.twl.ncku.edu.tw/hak-chia/l/li-khin-hoann/phok-su/phok-su.htm Lí Khîn-hoāⁿ] (also known as Tavokan Khîn-hoāⁿ or Chin-An Li), based on former research by scholars such as [[Ong Iok-tek|Ông Io̍k-tek]], has gone so far as to associate part of the basic vocabulary of the colloquial language with the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] and [[Tai languages|Tai]] language families; however, such claims are not without controversy. Recently there has been a growing use of Taiwanese Hokkien in the broadcast media.

The accents of Taiwanese is relatively small but still exist, the standard accent — Thong-hêng accent ({{lang|zh-tw|通行腔}}) is sampled from [[Kaohsiung]] city. &lt;ref&gt;[http://twblg.dict.edu.tw/holodict_new/compile1_3_9_3.jsp 臺灣閩南語常用詞辭典編輯凡例]&lt;/ref&gt; while other accents fall into a spectrum between 
* Hái-kháu accent ({{lang|zh-tw|海口腔}}): representing the accent spoken in [[Lukang, Changhua|Lukang]], close to [[Quanzhou]] [[Quanzhou dialect|dialect]] in [[China]], and
* Lāi-po͘ accent ({{lang|zh-tw|內埔腔}}): representing the accent spoken in [[Yilan City|Yilan]], close to [[Zhangzhou]] [[Zhangzhou dialect|dialect]] in [[China]].

A great part of Taiwanese Hokkien is generally understood by other dialects of Hokkien as spoken in [[China]] and [[South-east Asia]] but has a degree of intelligibility with the [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] variant of [[Southern Min]] spoken in Eastern Guangdong, [[China]]. It is, however, mutually unintelligible with Mandarin or other Chinese languages.

=== Hakka ===
{{Main|Taiwanese Hakka}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
'''Hakka''' ({{lang|zh-tw|客家語}}, ''Hak-kâ-ngî'') is mainly spoken in Taiwan by people who have [[Hakka people|Hakka]] ancestry. These people are concentrated in several places throughout Taiwan. The majority of [[Hakka Taiwanese]] reside in [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]], [[Hsinchu County|Hsinchu]] and [[Miaoli County|Miaoli]]. Hakka was made an official language in December 2017. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2017/12/30/2003684894 |title= Hakka made an official language |publisher=Taipei Times |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the Hakka language in Taiwan is maintained by the [[Hakka Affairs Council]]. This governmental agency also runs [[Hakka TV]] and Hakka Radio stations. The government currently recognizes and maintains six Hakka dialects in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Republic of China Yearbook 2010 |chapterurl=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/02People&amp;Language.pdf |chapter=Chapter 2: People and Language |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805173731/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/02People%26Language.pdf |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan) |isbn=9789860252781 |page=42 |archivedate=2011-08-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Matsu dialect ===
{{Main|Matsu dialect}}
'''Matsu dialect''' ({{lang|zh-tw|馬祖話}}, ''Mā-cū-huâ'') is the language spoken in [[Matsu islands]]. It is a dialect of [[Fuzhou dialect]], [[Eastern Min]].

== Written and sign languages ==
=== Chinese characters ===
[[Traditional Chinese characters]] is widely used in [[Taiwan]] to write [[Sinitic languages]] including [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]], [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] and [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]]. The [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education]] maintains standards of writing for these languages, publications including the [[Standard Form of National Characters]] and the recommended characters for Taiwanese Hokkien and Hakka.

[[Written vernacular Chinese]] is the standard of [[written Chinese]] used in official documents, general literature and most aspects of everyday life, and has grammar based on [[Standard Chinese|Modern Standard Mandarin]]. Vernacular Chinese is the modern written variant of Chinese that supplanted the use of [[classical Chinese]] in literature following the [[New Culture Movement]] of the early 20th Century, which is based on the grammar of Chinese spoken in ancient times. In recent times, following the [[Taiwan localization movement]] and an increasing presence of Taiwanese literature, [[written Hokkien]] based on the vocabulary and grammar of [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] is occasionally used in literature and informal communications.

Traditional Chinese characters are also used in Hong Kong, a small number of characters are written differently in Taiwan; the [[Standard Form of National Characters]] is the orthography standard used in Taiwan and administered by the [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education]], and has minor variances compared with the [[List of Forms of Frequently Used Characters|standardised character forms]] used in Hong Kong. Such differences relate to [[Variant Chinese character#Orthodox and vulgar variants|orthodox and vulgar variants]] of Chinese characters.

=== Latin alphabet and Romanization ===
{{Main|Writing systems of Formosan languages|Chinese language romanization in Taiwan}}
{{seealso|Taiwanese Romanization System|Taiwanese Hakka Romanization System}}
[[Latin alphabet]] is native to [[Formosan languages]] and partially native to [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] and [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]]. With the early influences of European missionaries, writing systems such as [[Sinckan Manuscripts]], [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī]], and [[Pha̍k-fa-sṳ]] were based on in Latin alphabet. Currently the official [[Writing systems of Formosan languages|Writing systems]] of [[Formosan languages]] is solely based on Latin and maintained by the [[Council of Indigenous Peoples]]. The [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education]] also maintains Latin based systems [[Taiwanese Romanization System]] for [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], and [[Taiwanese Hakka Romanization System]] for [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]]. The textbook of [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] and [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]] are written in a mixed script of [[Traditional Chinese characters]] and Latin alphabet.

[[Chinese language romanization in Taiwan]] tends to be highly inconsistent. Taiwan still uses the Zhuyin system and does not use the [[Latin alphabet]] as the language phonetic symbol. Traditionally [[Wade–Giles]] is used, the central government adopted [[Tongyong Pinyin]] as the official romanization in 2002 but local governments are permitted to override the standard as some have adopted [[Hanyu Pinyin]] and retained old romanizations that are commonly used. However, in August 2008 the central government announced that [[Hanyu Pinyin]] will be the only system of Romanization in Taiwan as of January 2009.

=== Phonetic symbols ===
{{Main|Bopomofo|Taiwanese Phonetic Symbols}}
[[File:Zhuyin and Hanzi location.svg|250px|right]]
''Zhuyin Fuhao'', often abbreviated as ''Zhuyin'', or known as ''Bopomofo'' after its first four letters, is the [[phonetic]] system of [[Taiwan]] for teaching the pronunciation of [[Chinese characters]], especially in [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]]. [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]] uses 37 symbols to represent its sounds: 21 [[consonant]]s and 16 [[Syllable rime|rimes]]. [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] uses 45 symbols to represent its sounds: 21 [[consonant]]s and 24 [[Syllable rime|rimes]]. There is also a system created for [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]] language. 

These phonetic symbols sometimes appear as [[ruby characters]] printed next to the Chinese characters in young children's [[book]]s, and in editions of classical texts (which frequently use characters that appear at very low frequency rates in newspapers and other such daily fare). In advertisements, these phonetic symbols are sometimes used to write certain particles (e.g., [[wiktionary:ㄉ|ㄉ]] instead of [[wiktionary:的|的]]); other than this, one seldom sees these symbols used in mass media adult publications except as a pronunciation guide (or index system) in [[dictionary]] entries.  Bopomofo symbols are also mapped to the ordinary Roman character keyboard (1 = ''bo'', q = ''po'', a = ''mo'', and so forth) used in one [[Chinese input methods for computers|method]] for inputting Chinese text when using the [[computer]].

The sole purpose for Zhuyin in elementary education is to teach standard Mandarin pronunciation to children. Grade one textbooks of all subjects (including Mandarin) are entirely in zhuyin. After that year, Chinese character texts are given in annotated form. Around grade four, presence of Zhuyin annotation is greatly reduced, remaining only in the new character section. [[School]] children learn the symbols so that they can decode pronunciations given in a Chinese dictionary, and also so that they can find how to write words for which they know only the sounds.

=== Sign language===
{{main|Taiwanese Sign Language}}

==Other languages==
=== Japanese ===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
The [[Japanese language]] was compulsorily taught while [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan was under Japanese rule]] (1895 to 1945). Although fluency is now largely limited to the elderly, most of Taiwan's youth who look to Japan as the trend-setter of the region's youth pop culture now might know a bit of Japanese through the [[Media of Taiwan|media]], their grandparents, or classes taken from private "[[Cram school#Taiwan|cram schools]]".{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== South-East Asian languages ===
There are a significant immigrant and spouses in [[Taiwan]] are from [[South-East Asia]]. 
* '''[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]''': Indonesian is the most widely spoken language among the approximately 140,000 [[Indonesians in Taiwan]].
* '''[[Javanese language|Javanese]]''': Javanese is also spoken by [[Javanese people]] from Indonesia who are in Taiwan.
* '''[[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]''': Tagalog is also widely spoken by [[Filipinos]] by the approximately 108,520 [[Filipinos in Taiwan]].
* '''[[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]''': There are somewhere around 200,000 [[Vietnamese in Taiwan]], many of whom speak Vietnamese. There has been some effort, particularly beginning in 2011, to teach Vietnamese as a heritage language to children of Vietnamese immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/01434632.2014.912284 | volume=36 | title=Learning Vietnamese as a heritage language in Taiwan | journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development | pages=255–265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European languages ===
* '''[[Dutch language|Dutch]]''': Dutch was taught to the residents of the island during the [[Dutch colonial rule of Taiwan]]. After the withdrawal of Dutch presence in Taiwan, the use of the language disappeared.
*[[Spanish language|'''Spanish''']]: Spanish was mainly spoken by the northern part of the island during the establishment of a [[Spanish Formosa|Spanish colony in Formosa]] until 1642.

=== Sino-Tibetan languages  ===
* '''[[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]''': Cantonese is spoken by many recent and early immigrants from southeastern China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Furthermore, Taiwan has been one of the largest consumers of [[Hong Kong cinema]], [[cantopop]], and pop culture in the late 1900s. As a result, many educated Taiwanese still continue to learn the language.

=== English ===

*'''[[English language|English]]''': English is a common foreign language, with some large private schools providing English instruction. English is compulsory in students' curriculum once they enter elementary school. English as a school subject is also featured on Taiwan's education exams. Recently, the Taiwanese Ministry of Education has been planning to make English an official language of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/08/31/taiwan-make-english-official-language-next-year-says-official/|title=Taiwan to make English an official language next year, says official {{!}} Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|date=2018-08-31|work=Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unpopular designs==
[[British Airways]] introduced varied and unusual tailfin designs in 1997.  These "airline liveries and logos" were intended to make the airline's branding more cosmopolitan and were described as "arty" and "ethnic".  They were unpopular with many customers and also caused confusion for ground controllers who had more difficulty recognising the [[British Airways ethnic liveries]] aircraft to give clear taxiing instructions.  Despite the £60M expense of this livery, it was replaced completely in 2001 and the airline has now returned to a more traditional design based upon the [[Union flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/uk/1325127.stm|title=R.I.P. British Airways' funky tailfins|publisher=BBC|date=11 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brussels Airlines|Brussels Airlines']] first logo was a stylised letter [[B]] composed of 13 dots resembling a [[runway]].  This was thought to be unlucky and protests by [[superstition|superstitious]] passengers caused the airline to add another dot.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6383171.stm|title='Unlucky' airline logo grounded|publisher=BBC|date=21 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7584">'''The Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History,''' also known as '''The Nunn Center,''' at the [[University of Kentucky]] is a center of oral history interviews concentrating on 20th and 21st century, state [[Kentucky]] history. The Nunn Center maintains a collection of over 8,000 interviews made up of over 100 projects with an emphasis on political, [[Appalachian culture|Appalachian]], agricultural, athletic and veterans' history. The Nunn Center for Oral History is part of the University of Kentucky Libraries Special Collections division.

==History==
The oral history program at the University of Kentucky Libraries was begun in 1973 by Charles Atcher. From 1974 until 2005, the program was directed by Terry Birdwhistell, Ed.D.&lt;ref name=UKyEdu-HallofFame-Birdwhistell-2006&gt;{{cite web|title=Terry L. Birdwhistell, Ed.D. in '95.

Since 2008, the Nunn Center has been directed by [[Douglas A. Boyd|Doug Boyd, Ph.D.]]&lt;ref name=KyArchivist-NewDirector-2008&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nunn Center Names New Director|journal=The Kentucky Archivist|date=Spring 2008|volume=30|issue=1|page=5|url=http://www.kyarchivists.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/KentuckyArchivist_2008_Spring.pdf|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center is named after former Kentucky Governor [[Louie B. Nunn]].

==Collection==
The Nunn Center contains over 8,000 interviews featuring a variety of individuals and projects. Major projects have included the Family Farm Project, the Colonel Arthur L. Kelly Veterans Oral History Project, oral history projects on [[University of Kentucky]] history, African American history in Kentucky,&lt;ref name=OralHistReview-BlackPast-1982&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=G.

==Digitization==
The Nunn Center has aggressively undertaken efforts to digitize its collection.&lt;ref name=DLib-LgScaleDigitization-2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weig|first1=Eric|last2=Terry|first2=Kopana|last3=Lybarger|first3=Kathryn|title=Large Scale Digitization of Oral History: A Case Study|journal=[[D-Lib Magazine]]|date=May 2007|volume=13|issue=5/6|url=http://dlib.org/dlib/may07/weig/05weig.html|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oral History Metadata Synchronizer (OHMS)===
In 2008, the Nunn Center launched the [[Oral History Metadata Synchronizer (OHMS)]] online interface that synchronizes searchable text to audio and video. This system, designed by Nunn Center director Doug Boyd in partnership with Digital Library Services from the United Kingdom, allows users to link from their search results tom the corresponding moments in the interview.&lt;ref name=CampusTech-KY-OralHist-2009&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harrison|first1=Denise|last2=Skalsky|first2=Cindy|title=Digital Repositories: U Kentucky Goes Digital with Thousands of Oral Histories|url=http://campustechnology.com/articles/2009/09/09/u-kentucky-goes-digital-with-thousands-of-oral-histories.aspx|accessdate=7 October 2015|work=Campus Technology|date=9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oral History Metadata Synchronizer (OHMS)|OHMS]] was featured in an article in the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' in July 2011.&lt;ref name=ChronicleHigherEd-OHMS-2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wolverton|first1=Brad|title=New Tool Could Help Researchers Make Better Use of Oral Histories|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/players/new-tool-could-help-researchers-make-better-use-of-oral-histories/28855|accessdate=7 October 2015|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mondly is based in [[Brașov, Romania]] and was founded at the end of 2013 by Alexandru Iliescu and Tudor Iliescu, graduates of [[Transilvania University]] of Brașov.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theappguy.co/the-app-guy-podcast/2015/7/8/tagp337-alexandru-iliescu|title=TAGP337 Alexandru Iliescu : Follow The Launch Day For Mondly|work=The App Guy|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.in/Some-developers-are-furious-ahead-of-Facebooks-annual-conference-Theyre-declaring-war-on-their-partners/articleshow/63954907.cms|title=Some developers are furious ahead of Facebook's annual conference: 'They're declaring war on their partners'|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company launched the first app in May 2014 on [[iTunes]] and on [[Google Play]] in June 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28607">In [[metaphysics]], '''nominalism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] view which denies the existence of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] and [[abstract object]]s, but affirms the existence of general or abstract terms and [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]].&lt;ref&gt;Mill (1872); Bigelow (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least two main versions of nominalism. One version denies the existence of universals – things that can be instantiated or exemplified by many particular things (e.g., strength, humanity). The other version specifically denies the existence of abstract objects – objects that do not exist in space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez-Pereyra (2008) writes: "The word 'Nominalism', as used by contemporary philosophers in the Anglo-American tradition, is ambiguous. In one sense, its most traditional sense deriving from the Middle Ages, it implies the rejection of universals. In another, more modern but equally entrenched sense, it implies the rejection of abstract objects" (§1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most nominalists have held that only physical particulars in space and time are real, and that universals exist only ''post res'', that is, subsequent to particular things.&lt;ref&gt;Feibleman (1962), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some versions of nominalism hold that some particulars are abstract entities (e.g., numbers), while others are concrete entities – entities that do exist in space and time (e.g., pillars, snakes, bananas).

Nominalism is primarily a position on the [[problem of universals]], which dates back at least to [[Plato]], and is opposed to [[Philosophical realism|realist]] philosophies, such as [[Platonic realism]], which assert that universals do exist over and above particulars. However, the name "nominalism" emerged from debates in medieval philosophy with [[Roscellinus]].

The term 'nominalism' stems from the [[Latin]] ''nomen'', "name". For example, [[John Stuart Mill]] once wrote, that "there is nothing general except names".

In [[philosophy of law]], nominalism finds its application in what is called '''constitutional nominalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;An overview of the philosophical problems and an application of the concept to a case of the Supreme Court of the State of California, gives Thomas Kupka, 'Verfassungsnominalismus', in: ''Archives for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy'' 97 (2011), 44–77, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2343741 PDF].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{also|Anti-realism}}
===Ancient Greek philosophy===
[[Plato]] was perhaps the first&lt;ref name="Penner 1987, p. 24"&gt;Penner (1987), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; writer in [[Western philosophy]] to clearly state a non-nominalist position:
&lt;blockquote&gt; ...We customarily hypothesize a single form in connection with each of the many things to which we apply the same name.  ...  For example, there are many beds and tables.  ...  But there are only two forms of such furniture, one of the bed and one of the table.  ([[The Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] 596a-b, trans. Grube) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What about someone who believes in beautiful things, but doesn't believe in the beautiful itself…? Don't you think he is living in a dream rather than a wakened state? (''Republic'' 476c)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Platonic universals corresponding to the names "bed" and "beautiful" were the [[Theory of Forms|Form]] of the Bed and the Form of the Beautiful, or the ''Bed Itself'' and the ''Beautiful Itself''.  Platonic Forms were the first universals posited as such in philosophy.&lt;ref name="Penner 1987, p. 24"/&gt;

Our term "universal" is due to the English translation of [[Aristotle]]'s technical term ''katholou'' which he coined specially for the purpose of discussing the problem of universals.&lt;ref&gt;Peters (1967), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Katholou'' is a contraction of the phrase ''kata holou'', meaning "on the whole".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/dict?name=lsj&amp;lang=el&amp;word=kaqo%2flou&amp;filter=GreekXlit "katholou"] in [[Harvard]]'s Archimedes Project online version of [[Henry Liddell|Liddell]] &amp; [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott]]'s ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle famously rejected certain aspects of Plato's Theory of Forms, but he clearly rejected nominalism as well:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...'Man', and indeed every general predicate, signifies not an individual, but some quality, or quantity or relation, or something of that sort.  (''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'' xxii, 178b37, trans. Pickard-Cambridge)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first philosophers to explicitly describe nominalist arguments were the [[Stoics]], especially [[Chrysippus]].&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84–85: "[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ... For Chrysippus there are no universal entities, whether they be conceived as substantial [[Platonic Forms]] or in some other manner.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/chrysipp/ Chrysippus (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval philosophy===
In [[medieval philosophy]], the French philosopher and [[Theology|theologian]] [[Roscellinus]] (c. 1050 – c. 1125) was an early, prominent proponent of nominalism. Nominalist ideas can be found in the work of [[Peter Abelard]] and reached their flowering in [[William of Ockham]], who was the most influential and thorough nominalist. Abelard's and Ockham's version of nominalism is sometimes called [[conceptualism]], which presents itself as a middle way between nominalism and realism, asserting that there ''is'' something in common among like individuals, but that it is a concept in the mind, rather than a real entity existing independently of the mind. Ockham argued that only individuals existed and that universals were only mental ways of referring to sets of individuals. "I maintain", he wrote, "that a universal is not something real that exists in a subject... but that it has a being only as a thought-object in the mind [objectivum in anima]". As a general rule, Ockham argued against assuming any entities that were not necessary for explanations.  Accordingly, he wrote, there is no reason to believe that there is an entity called "humanity" that resides inside, say, Socrates, and nothing further is explained by making this claim. This is in accord with the analytical method that has since come to be called [[Ockham's razor]], the principle that the explanation of any phenomenon should make as few assumptions as possible. Critics argue that conceptualist approaches only answer the psychological question of universals. If the same concept is ''correctly'' and non-arbitrarily applied to two individuals, there must be some resemblance or shared property between the two individuals that justifies their falling under the same concept and that is just the metaphysical problem that universals were brought in to address, the starting-point of the whole problem (MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein, 2006, §3d). If resemblances between individuals are asserted, conceptualism becomes moderate realism; if they are denied, it collapses into nominalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friesian.com/universl.htm|title=Meaning and the Problem of Universals|author=|date=|website=www.friesian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern and contemporary philosophy===
In [[modern philosophy]], nominalism was revived by [[Thomas Hobbes]]&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes/ Thomas Hobbes (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pierre Gassendi]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gassendi/ Pierre Gassendi (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[analytic philosophy]], it has been defended by [[Rudolf Carnap]],&lt;ref name=:0&gt;[https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/resemblance-nominalism-a-solution-to-the-problem-of-universals/ "Review of Gonzalo Rodriguez-Pereyra, ''Resemblance Nominalism: A Solution to the Problem of Universals''" – ndpr.nd.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nelson Goodman]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goodman/supplement.html "Nelson Goodman: The Calculus of Individuals in its different versions", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[H. H. Price]],&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; and [[D. C. Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-dc/ Donald Cary Williams, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The problem of universals==

Nominalism arose in reaction to the [[problem of universals]], specifically accounting for the fact that some things are of the same type.  For example, Fluffy and Kitzler are both cats, or, the fact that certain properties are repeatable, such as: the grass, the shirt, and Kermit the Frog are green. One wants to know by virtue of ''what'' are Fluffy and Kitzler both cats, and ''what'' makes the grass, the shirt, and Kermit green.

The [[Platonic realism|Platonist]] answer is that all the green things are green in virtue of the [[existence]] of a universal; a single [[Abstraction|abstract]] thing that, in this case, is a [[part (mathematics)|part]] of all the green things. With respect to the color of the grass, the shirt and Kermit, one of their parts is identical. In this respect, the three parts are literally one. Greenness is repeatable because there is one thing that [[exemplification|manifests]] itself wherever there are green things.

Nominalism denies the existence of universals. The motivation for this flows from several concerns, the first one being where they might exist. [[Plato]] famously held, on one interpretation, that there is a realm of abstract forms or universals apart from the physical world (see [[theory of the forms]]). Particular physical objects merely exemplify or instantiate the universal. But this raises the question: Where is this universal realm?  One possibility is that it is outside space and time. A view sympathetic with this possibility holds that, precisely because some form is immanent in several physical objects, it must also transcend each of those physical objects; in this way, the forms are "transcendent" only insofar as they are "immanent" in many physical objects. In other words, immanence implies transcendence; they are not opposed to one another. (Nor, in this view, would there be a separate "world" or "realm" of forms that is distinct from the physical world, thus shirking much of the worry about where to locate a "universal realm".) However, [[metaphysical naturalism|naturalists]] assert that nothing is outside of space and time. Some [[Neoplatonists]], such as the pagan philosopher [[Plotinus]] and the Christian philosopher [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], imply (anticipating [[conceptualism]]) that universals are contained within the [[Preformation theory|''mind'' of God]]. To complicate things, what is the nature of the [[instantiation principle|instantiation]] or [[exemplification]] [[logic of relatives|relation]]?

[[Conceptualism|Conceptualists]] hold a position intermediate between nominalism and [[Philosophical realism|realism]], saying that universals exist only within the [[mind]] and have no external or substantial reality.

[[Moderate realism|Moderate realists]] hold that there is no realm in which universals exist, but rather universals are located in space and time wherever they are manifest. Now, recall that a universal, like greenness, is supposed to be a single thing. Nominalists consider it unusual that there could be a single thing that exists in multiple places simultaneously. The realist maintains that all the instances of greenness are held together by the exemplification relation, but this relation cannot be explained.

Finally, many philosophers prefer simpler [[ontology|ontologies]] populated with only the bare minimum of types of entities, or as [[W. V. O. Quine]] said "They have a taste for 'desert landscapes.'" They try to express everything that they want to explain without using universals such as "catness" or "greenness."

==Varieties&lt;!--Predicate nominalism', 'Resemblance nominalism', and 'Class nominalism' redirect here--&gt;==
There are various forms of nominalism ranging from extreme to almost-realist. One extreme is '''predicate nominalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, which states that Fluffy and Kitzler, for example, are both cats simply because the predicate 'is a cat' applies to both of them. And this is the case for all similarity of attribute among objects. The main criticism of this view is that it does not provide a sufficient solution to the problem of universals. It fails to provide an account of what makes it the case that a group of things warrant having the same predicate applied to them.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein (2006), §3a.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of '''resemblance nominalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; believe that 'cat' applies to both cats because Fluffy and Kitzler resemble an [[wikt:exemplar|exemplar]] cat closely enough to be classed together with it as members of its [[natural kind|kind]], or that they differ from each other (and other cats) quite less than they differ from other things, and this warrants classing them together.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein (2006), §3b.&lt;/ref&gt; Some resemblance nominalists will concede that the resemblance relation is itself a universal, but is the only universal necessary. Others argue that each resemblance relation is a particular, and is a resemblance relation simply in virtue of its resemblance to other resemblance relations. This generates an infinite regress, but many argue that it is not [[virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, H. H. Price (1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Class nominalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; argues that class membership forms the metaphysical backing for property relationships: two particular red balls share a property in that they are both members of classes corresponding to their properties—that of being red and being balls. A version of class nominalism that sees some classes as "natural classes" is held by [[Anthony Quinton, Baron Quinton|Anthony Quinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Properties and Classes|first=Anthony|last=Quinton|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society|volume=58|year=1957|pages=33–58|jstor=4544588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conceptualism]] is a philosophical theory that explains universality of particulars as conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking mind.&lt;ref&gt;Strawson, P. F. "Conceptualism." Universals, concepts and qualities: new essays on the meaning of predicates. Ashgate Publishing, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept of universals from a perspective that denies their presence in particulars outside of the mind's perception of them.&lt;ref&gt;"Conceptualism." The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy. Simon Blackburn. Oxford University Press, 1996. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 8 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of nominalism is [[trope nominalism]].  A trope is a particular instance of a property, like the specific greenness of a shirt.  One might argue that there is a primitive, [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] resemblance relation that holds among like tropes.  Another route is to argue that all apparent tropes are constructed out of more primitive tropes and that the most primitive tropes are the entities of complete [[physics]].  Primitive trope resemblance may thus be accounted for in terms of causal [[indiscernibility]]. Two tropes are exactly resembling if substituting one for the other would make no difference to the events in which they are taking part. Varying degrees of resemblance at the macro level can be explained by varying degrees of resemblance at the micro level, and micro-level resemblance is explained in terms of something no less robustly physical than causal power.  [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], perhaps the most prominent contemporary realist, argues that such a trope-based  variant of nominalism has promise, but holds that it is unable to account for the laws of nature in the way his theory of universals can.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[Ian Hacking]] has also argued that much of what is called [[social constructionism]] of science in contemporary times is actually motivated by an unstated nominalist metaphysical view.  For this reason, he claims, scientists and constructionists tend to "shout past each other".&lt;ref&gt;Hacking (1999), pp. 80-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytic philosophy and mathematics===
A notion that philosophy, especially [[ontology]] and the [[philosophy of mathematics]] should abstain from [[set theory]] owes much to the writings of [[Nelson Goodman]] (see especially Goodman 1940 and 1977), who argued that concrete and abstract entities having no parts, called ''individuals'' exist. Collections of individuals likewise exist, but two collections having the same individuals are the same collection. Goodman was himself drawing heavily on the work of [[Stanisław Leśniewski]], especially his [[mereology]], which was itself a reaction to the paradoxes associated with Cantorian set theory. Leśniewski denied the existence of the [[empty set]] and held that any [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] was identical to the individual inside it. Classes corresponding to what are held to be species or genera are concrete sums of their concrete constituting individuals. For example, the class of philosophers is nothing but the sum of all concrete, individual philosophers.

The principle of [[extensionality]] in set theory assures us that any matching pair of curly braces enclosing one or more instances of the same individuals denote the same set. Hence {''a'', ''b''}, {''b'', ''a''}, {''a'', ''b'', ''a'', ''b''} are all the same set. For Goodman and other nominalists, {''a'', ''b''} is also identical to {''a'', {''b''} }, {''b'', {''a'', ''b''} }, and any combination of matching curly braces and one or more instances of ''a'' and ''b'', as long as ''a'' and ''b'' are names of individuals and not of collections of individuals. Goodman, [[Richard Milton Martin]], and [[Willard Quine]] all advocated reasoning about collectivities by means of a theory of ''virtual sets'' (see especially Quine 1969), one making possible all elementary operations on sets except that the [[universe]] of a quantified variable cannot contain any virtual sets.

In the [[foundation of mathematics]], nominalism has come to mean doing mathematics without assuming that [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] in the mathematical sense exist. In practice, this means that [[Quantifier (logic)|quantified variables]] may range over [[universe]]s of [[number]]s, [[point (geometry)|points]], primitive [[ordered pair]]s, and other abstract ontological primitives, but not over sets whose members are such individuals. To date, only a small fraction of the corpus of modern mathematics can be rederived in a nominalistic fashion.

==Criticisms==
;Critique of the historical origins of the term
As a category of late medieval thought, the concept of 'nominalism' has been increasingly queried. Traditionally, the fourteenth century has been regarded as the heyday of nominalism, with figures such as [[John Buridan]] and [[William of Ockham]] viewed as founding figures. However, the concept of 'nominalism' as a movement (generally contrasted with 'realism'), first emerged only in the late fourteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;The classic starting point of nominalism has been the edict issued by [[Louis XI]] in 1474 commanding that realism alone (as contained in scholars such as [[Averroes]], [[Albert the Great]], [[Aquinas]], [[Duns Scotus]] and [[Bonaventure]]) be taught at the University of Paris, and ordering that the books of various 'renovating scholars', including Ockham, [[Gregory of Rimini]], Buridan and [[Peter of Ailly]] be removed. The edict used the word 'nominalist' to describe those students at Paris who 'are not afraid to imitate' the renovators. These students then made a reply to Louis XI, defending nominalism as a movement going back to Ockham, which had been persecuted repeatedly, but which in fact represents the truer philosophy.  See Robert Pasnau, ''Metaphysical Themes, 1274-1671'', (New York: OUP, 2011), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; and only gradually became widespread during the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;For example, when [[Jerome of Prague]] visited the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1406, he described the nominalists as those who deny the reality of universals outside the human mind, and realists as those who affirm that reality. Also, for instance, in a 1425 document from the [[University of Cologne]] which draws a distinction between the via of Thomas Aquinas, Albert the Great, and the via of the 'modern masters' John Buridan and Marsilius of Inghen. See Robert Pasnau, ''Metaphysical Themes, 1274-1671'', (New York: OUP, 2011), p84.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of two distinct ways, a ''via antiqua'', associated with realism, and a ''via moderna'', associated with nominalism, became widespread only in the later fifteenth century – a dispute which eventually dried up in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name="See Robert Pasnau 2011 p84"&gt;See Robert Pasnau, ''Metaphysical Themes, 1274-1671'', (New York: OUP, 2011), p84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aware that explicit thinking in terms of a divide between 'nominalism' and 'realism' only emerged in the fifteenth century, scholars have increasingly questioned whether a fourteenth-century school of nominalism can really be said to have existed. While one might speak of family resemblances between Ockham, Buridan, Marsilius and others, there are also striking differences. More fundamentally, Robert Pasnau has questioned whether any kind of coherent body of thought that could be called 'nominalism' can be discerned in fourteenth century writing.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert Pasnau, ''Metaphysical Themes, 1274-1671'', (New York: OUP, 2011), p86.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it difficult, it has been argued, to follow the twentieth century narrative which portrayed late scholastic philosophy as a dispute which emerged in the fourteenth century between the ''via moderna'', nominalism, and the ''via antiqua'', realism, with the nominalist ideas of [[William of Ockham]] foreshadowing the eventual rejection of scholasticism in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="See Robert Pasnau 2011 p84"/&gt;

;Critique of nominalist reconstructions in mathematics
A critique of nominalist reconstructions in mathematics was undertaken by Burgess (1983) and Burgess and Rosen (1997). Burgess distinguished two types of nominalist reconstructions.  Thus, ''hermeneutic nominalism'' is the hypothesis that science, properly interpreted, already dispenses with mathematical objects
(entities) such as numbers and sets.  Meanwhile, ''revolutionary nominalism'' is the project of replacing current scientific theories by alternatives dispensing with mathematical objects (see Burgess, 1983, p.&amp;nbsp;96).  A recent study extends the Burgessian critique to three nominalistic reconstructions: the reconstruction of analysis by [[Georg Cantor]], [[Richard Dedekind]], and [[Karl Weierstrass]] that dispensed with [[infinitesimal]]s; the [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] re-reconstruction of Weierstrassian analysis by [[Errett Bishop]] that dispensed with the [[law of excluded middle]]; and the hermeneutic reconstruction, by [[Carl Boyer]], [[Judith Grabiner]], and others, of [[Cauchy]]'s foundational contribution to analysis that dispensed with Cauchy's infinitesimals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Usadi Katz | first1 = Karin | authorlink2 = Mikhail Katz | last2 = Katz | first2 = Mikhail G. | year = 2011 | title = A Burgessian Critique of Nominalistic Tendencies in Contemporary Mathematics and its Historiography | url = | journal = [[Foundations of Science]] | volume = | issue = | page = | doi = 10.1007/s10699-011-9223-1 | arxiv = 1104.0375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2842">'''OLYFRAN''', which stands for ''Olympiade flamande du français'' ([[French language|French]] for "Flemish Olympiad for French") is a contest organised in [[Flanders]] (the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking part of [[Belgium]]) to test students' knowledge of the French language (which is the language spoken in the southern part of Belgium, [[Wallonia]]).

==History==
In 1987, Willy Clijsters, professor French as Foreign Language ([[Français langue étrangère|FLE]]) at the [[Hasselt University]] and president of '''DiWeF''', the association of Flemish teachers FLE, launched ''"La Tour Eiffel - Concours de Français".''

This contest consisted of a written selection test of 100 multiple choice questions in three different categories, followed by a classification interview in front of a mixed jury of teachers and representatives of the business world. The elimination question lists are mainly centred on everyday communication and have been developed in a contrastive approach. This means that the questions are partially written in the source language, Dutch.

The initiative, which was launched in 1988 to make the teaching of French more dynamic for youngsters in the Belgian province of Limburg, welcomed about 1,200 participants from all over Flanders. Soon, all the Flemish universities ([[Leuven]] - [[Kortrijk]] - [[Ghent]] - [[Antwerp]] - [[Brussels]]) joined the organization. Growing very quickly and strongly since, LTECF has received in each of the last few years of the competitions about 5.000 candidates.

Meanwhile, the contest changed name and is now called ''"the Flemish Olympiad for French”'' ''(Olyfran).'' As part of this activity, every year 400 multiple choice question on the French language are drawn up by secondary school teachers and academics. All this material (over 5000 MCQ), provided with several parameters, is available for Francophiles and learners of French and their teachers on the Internet.

==More information==

* Everybody can organize own his/her free competition French: for one class, for one school, in a region ... Several countries have already done this.
* From the International Day of Francophonie (March 20), a World Tournament on French via the  Internet welcomes participants from all around the world. 
* Interchange (virtual, physical) of classes: Olyfran can help with contacts in French and Walloon (French-speaking Belgium) secondary school. Visitors may report an exchange of experience to inspire others to venture on the same exciting way.

'''Pierre Lhande Heguy''' ({{lang-eu|Pierre Allande Hegi}}) was born in [[Bayonne]], France on 9 July 1877 and died 17 April 1957 in [[Tardets]], [[Soule]]. For unknown reasons he was given his grandfather's surname, Lhande, as opposed to his father's surname Basagaitz.&lt;ref name=Amendi&gt;Auñamendi Entziklopedia [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/81039?op=4&amp;primR=21&amp;idi=en&amp;regs=10&amp;bGen=S&amp;bCan=S&amp;bCal=S&amp;bGal=S&amp;bAna=S&amp;bFon=S&amp;bEus=S&amp;EIKVOGEN=pierre%20lhande&amp;bCul=S&amp;bAun=S&amp;bBib=S&amp;pos=24 Lhande Heguy, Pierre] Retrieved 29 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
At the age of 8 when Lhande's father died he moved to [[Sauguis-Saint-Étienne]] in [[Soule]] with his mother. A young man, he joined the [[Seminary]] of Bayonne but was subsequently expelled due to his pre-occupation with poetry and the Basque language. He then joined the [[Jesuits]] of [[Rodez]] and moved to [[Belgium]] and later the [[Netherlands]] with the order. After a teaching spell in [[El Puerto de Santa María]], he returned to Belgium and was ordained in August 1910. He returned to [[Hondarribia]] in the [[Northern Basque Country]] in 1911. He would remain in the Basque Country until his death in 1957 in the Saint-Antoine à Tardets home.&lt;ref name=Amendi/&gt;

==Works==
The author of numerous pieces of writing, he is perhaps best known for his monumental 1926 ''Dictionnaire Basque-Français'' of the Northern [[Basque dialects]] [[Lapurdian|Labourdin]], [[Lower Navarrese]] and [[Souletin]].

''"Your eel, I think, Sir?"''
----
Cartoon in [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'' magazine]]: 28 July 1920]]

'''Politeness''' is the practical application of good manners or [[etiquette]]. It is a culturally defined phenomenon, and therefore what is considered polite in one [[culture]] can sometimes be quite [[rudeness|rude]] or simply eccentric in another [[cultural relativism|cultural context]].

While the goal of politeness is to make all of the parties relaxed and comfortable with one another, these culturally defined standards at times may be manipulated to inflict [[shame]] on a designated party.

==Types==
Anthropologists [[Penelope Brown]] and [[Stephen C. Levinson|Stephen Levinson]] identified two kinds of politeness, deriving from [[Erving Goffman]]'s concept of [[Face (self image)|face]]:
* '''Negative politeness''': Making a request less infringing, such as "If you don't mind..." or "If it isn't too much trouble..."; respects a person's right to act freely. In other words, ''deference''. There is a greater use of indirect [[speech acts]]. 
* '''Positive politeness''': Seeks to establish a positive relationship between parties; respects a person's need to be liked and understood. Direct speech acts, [[profanity|swearing]] and flouting [[Gricean maxim|Grice's maxims]] can be considered aspects of positive politeness because:
** they show an awareness that the relationship is strong enough to cope with what would normally be considered impolite (in the popular understanding of the term);
** they articulate an awareness of the other person's values, which fulfills the person's desire to be accepted.

Some cultures seem to prefer one of these kinds of politeness over the other. In this way politeness is culturally bound.

==History==
[[Image:Spectator.jpg|thumb|''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'' fostered a culture of politeness among the middle-classes of early 18th century [[England]].]]

During the [[Enlightenment era]], a self-conscious process of the imposition of polite norms and behaviours became a symbol of being a genteel member of the [[upper class]]. Upwardly mobile [[middle class]] [[bourgeoisie]] increasingly tried to identify themselves with the elite through their adopted artistic preferences and their standards of behaviour. They became preoccupied with precise rules of [[etiquette]], such as when to show [[emotion]], the art of elegant dress and graceful conversation and how to act courteously, especially with women. Influential in this new discourse was a series of essays on the nature of politeness in a commercial society, penned by the philosopher [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6u6QyCKE5YC|title=Shaftesbury and the Culture of Politeness: Moral Discourse and Cultural Politics in Early Eighteenth-Century England|author=[[Lawrence E. Klein]]|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaftesbury defined politeness as the art of being pleasing in company:
:'Politeness' may be defined a dext'rous management of our words and actions, whereby we make other people have better opinion of us and themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2738536?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102574372923|title=The Third Earl of Shaftesbury and the Progress of Politeness|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Highmore - A Club of Gentlemen - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|Members of a [[Gentlemen's club]] had to conform to a socially acceptable standard of politeness. The painting, ''A Club of Gentlemen'' by [[Joseph Highmore]] c. 1730.]]
Periodicals, such as ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', founded as a daily publication by [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]] in 1711, gave regular advice to its readers on how to be a polite gentleman. Its stated goal was "to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality...to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses" It provided its readers with educated, topical talking points, and advice in how to carry on conversations and social interactions in a polite manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/famdates.php?id=888 |title=Information Britain |publisher=Information Britain |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of polite conversation and debate was particularly cultivated in the [[English coffeehouses in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries|coffeehouses]] of the period. [[Conversation]] was supposed to conform to a particular manner, with the language of polite and civil conversation considered to be essential to the conduct of coffeehouse debate and conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, 1996 p 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3133532 "Politeness and the Interpretation of the British Eighteenth Century"], Lawrence E. Klein, ''[[The Historical Journal]]'', Vol. 45, No. 4 (Dec., 2002), pp. 869-898.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of '[[civility]]' referred to a desired social interaction which valued sober and reasoned debate on matters of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, 2005. p 101&lt;/ref&gt; Established rules and procedures for proper behaviour as well as conventions, were outlined by [[gentleman's club]]s, such as Harrington's Rota Club. Periodicals, including ''[[Tatler (1709)|The Tatler]]'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', infused politeness into English coffeehouse conversation, as their explicit purpose lay in the reformation of English manners and morals.&lt;ref name="Mackie, 1998. p 1"&gt;Mackie, 1998. p 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
[[File:Southdown bus 199 (KUF 199F), 2009 Amberley Bus Day.jpg|thumb|A polite notice]]
* Expressing uncertainty and ambiguity through [[Hedge (linguistics)|hedging]] and indirectness.
* [[Polite lie|Polite lying]]
* Use of [[euphemism]]s (which make use of ambiguity as well as [[connotation]])
* Preferring [[tag question]]s to direct statements, such as "You were at the store, weren't you?"
** modal tags request information of which the speaker is uncertain. "You didn't go to the store yet, did you?"
** affective tags indicate concern for the listener. "You haven't been here long, have you?" 
*** softeners reduce the force of what would be a brusque demand. "Hand me that thing, could you?"
*** facilitative tags invite the addressee to comment on the request being made. "You can do that, can't you?"

Some studies&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, R. (1975) ''Language and Woman's Place''. New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beeching, K. (2002) ''Gender, Politeness and Pragmatic Particles in French''. Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that women are more likely to use politeness formulas than men, though the exact differences are not clear. Most current research has shown that gender differences in politeness use are complex,&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, J. 1995 Women Men and Language, Longman; Mills, Gender and Politeness, Cambridge University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; since there is a clear association between politeness norms and the stereotypical speech of middle class white women, at least in the UK and US. It is therefore unsurprising that women tend to be associated with politeness more and their linguistic behaviour judged in relation to these politeness norms.

==Linguistic devices==
Besides and additionally to the above, many languages have specific means to show politeness, deference, respect, or a recognition of the social status of the speaker and the hearer. There are two main ways in which a given language shows politeness: in its [[lexicon]] (for example, employing certain words in formal occasions, and colloquial forms in informal contexts), and in its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (for example, using special verb forms for polite discourse). The [[T-V distinction]] is a common example in Western languages.

==Criticism of the theory==
Brown and Levinson's theory of politeness has been criticised as not being universally valid, by linguists working with [[East Asian languages|East-Asian languages]], including Japanese. Matsumoto&lt;ref&gt;Matsumoto, Y. (1988) "Reexamination of the universality of Face: Politeness phenomena in Japanese". Journal of Pragmatics 12: 403–426.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ide&lt;ref&gt;Ide, S. (1989) "Formal forms and discernment: two neglected aspects of universals of linguistic politeness". Multilingua 8(2/3): 223–248.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that Brown and Levinson assume the speaker's volitional use of language, which allows the speaker's creative use of face-maintaining strategies toward the addressee. In East-Asian cultures like Japan, politeness is achieved not so much on the basis of volition as on discernment (''wakimae'', finding one's place), or prescribed [[social norms]]. ''Wakimae'' is oriented towards the need for acknowledgment of the positions or roles of all the participants as well as adherence to formality norms appropriate to the particular situation.

[[Japanese language|Japanese]] is perhaps the most widely known example of a language that encodes politeness at its very core. Japanese has two main levels of politeness, one for intimate acquaintances, family and friends, and one for other groups, and verb morphology reflects these levels. Besides that, some verbs have special hyper-polite [[suppletion|suppletive]] forms. This happens also with some nouns and interrogative pronouns. Japanese also employs different personal pronouns for each person according to gender, age, rank, degree of acquaintance, and other cultural factors. See [[Honorific speech in Japanese]], for further information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9195">A '''qualified electronic signature''' is an [[electronic signature]] that is compliant to EU Regulation No 910/2014 ([[eIDAS]] Regulation) for electronic transactions within the [[internal market|internal European market]].&lt;ref name="Tuner-QualifiedESig-eIDAS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Qualified Electronic Signatures For eIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/qualified-electronic-signatures-for-eidas|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It enables to verify the authorship of a declaration in electronic data exchange over long periods of time. Qualified electronic signatures can be considered as digital equivalent to handwritten signatures.&lt;ref name="QualESig-Bundesnetzagentur"&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualified Electronic Signature|url=http://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/EN/Service-Funktionen/QualifizierteelektronischeSignatur/qualifizierteelektronischesignatur-node.html|publisher=Bundesnetzagentur|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The purpose of eIDAS was to create a set of standards to ensure that electronic signatures could be used in a secure manner while conducting business online or while conducting official business across borders between [[EU member states]]. The qualified electronic signature is one such standard that has been outlined under eIDAS.&lt;ref name="EU-eIDAS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union|title=REGULATION (EU) No 910/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  of 23 July 2014  on Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions in the Internal Market and Repealing Directive 1999/93/EC|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG|publisher=Official Journal of the European Union|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-Understanding-eIDAS" /&gt;

A qualified electronic signature is an [[advanced electronic signature]] with a [[Public key certificate|qualified digital certificate]] that has been created by a qualified signature creation device (QSCD). For an electronic signature to be considered as a qualified electronic signature, it must meet three main requirements: First, the signatory must be linked and uniquely identified to the signature. The second point is that data used to create the signature must be under the sole control of the signatory. And last it must have the ability to identify if the data that accompanies the signature has been tampered with since the signing of the message.&lt;ref name="Tuner-QualifiedESig-eIDAS" /&gt;

It is important to note that creating a qualified electronic signature is more than merely adding a qualified certificate to an advanced electronic signature. The signature must also be created using a [[Secure signature creation device|qualified signature creation device]] (QSCD). This device is responsible for qualifying digital signatures by using specific hardware and software that ensures that the signatory only has control of their private key. In addition, a qualified trust service provider manages the signature creation data that is produced. The signature creation data must remain unique, confidential and protected from forgery.&lt;ref name="EU-eIDAS" /&gt;

Qualified electronic signatures that comply with eIDAS may be technically implemented through three specific digital signature standards [[XAdES]], [[PAdES]] and [[CAdES (computing)|CAdES]] that were developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ([[ETSI]]) and then need to be complemented with a [[qualified digital certificate]] through the procedures described above:&lt;ref name="Tuner-QualifiedESig-eIDAS" /&gt;

== Qualified trust service providers==
The qualified [[trust service provider]] has a crucial role in the process of qualified electronic signing. A trust service provider must receive qualified status from a supervisory governmental body that allows the entity to provide qualified trust services to be used in creating qualified electronic signatures. Regulated in eIDAS, the European Union published an EU Trust List with constitutive effect, meaning that a provider or service will only be qualified if it appears in the Trusted List.&lt;ref name="Forget-eIDAS-and-Banks"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forget|first1=Guillaume|title=The eIDAS Regulation Is Coming - How Can Banks Benefit From It|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/the-eidas-regulation-is-coming.-how-can-banks-benefit-from-it|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Qualified trust service providers are required to abide by the strict guidelines outlined under the eIDAS Regulation, which include as part of the certificate creation process:
* The service provider must provide a valid time and date for created certificates.
* Signatures that have expired certificates must be revoked immediately.
* Personnel employed by the qualified trust service provider must be appropriately trained.
* Software and hardware used by the service provider must be trustworthy and capable of preventing certificate forgery.&lt;ref name="EU-eIDAS" /&gt;

==Vision and expected impact==
Under eIDAS, the intent of the implementation of qualified electronic signatures is to serve several purposes, such as the facilitation of business and public services processes, including those that go across borders. These processes can be safely expedited using electronic signing. Under eIDAS, EU member states have been charged with establishing "points of single contact" (PSCs) for trust services to ensure that electronic ID schemes may be used in cross-border public sector transactions, such as exchanging and accessing healthcare information across borders.&lt;ref name="Turner-Understanding-eIDAS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Understanding eIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/understanding-eidas|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, a signatory would sign a document or message and then return it to the intended recipient via the postal service, facsimile service, by hand or by scanning and then attaching it to an email. The issue with these methods is that they are not always secure or timely. Delays in delivery could occur, and there exists the possibility that signatures could be forged or the enclosed documents may be altered. The risk increases as multiple signatures are required from different people who may be located in different locations. These problems are alleviated by using qualified electronic signatures, which save time, are legally binding, and provide a higher level of technical security.&lt;ref name="Tuner-QualifiedESig-eIDAS" /&gt;

The increased transparency in the electronic signing and transaction process and the enhanced interoperability are expected to spur innovation in the European [[internal market]].&lt;ref name="AshigINNOVATION"&gt;{{cite web|last1=J.A.|first1=Ashiq|title=The eIDAS Agenda: Innovation, Interoperability and transparency|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/the-eidas-agenda-innovation-interoperability-and-transparency|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal implications==
eIDAS requires that no electronic signature should be denied legal effect or admissibility as evidence solely on the grounds that it is in an electronic form or that it does not meet the requirements for qualified electronic signatures.&lt;ref&gt;eIDAS article 25&lt;/ref&gt; The qualified electronic signature shall have the equivalent legal effect as a handwritten signature. Its evidentiary value depends on the circumstances, but will normally be considered very high.&lt;ref&gt;eIDAS does not explicitly address the evidentiary value of qualified electronic certificates, but it states that qualified electronic seals should enjoy the ''presumption'' of the integrity of the data and of the correctness of the origin of that data to which the seal is linked (article 35 (2)). Qualified electronic signatures and seals are technically very similar.&lt;/ref&gt; All [[EU member state]]s are required to recognize a qualified electronic signature as valid, as long as it has been created with a qualified certificate that has been issued by another member state.

Under eIDAS Regulation, Article 27, ''Electronic signatures in public services'', member states are prohibited from requesting signatures of a higher level than qualified electronic signature. Article 25 (2) of eIDAS allows a qualified electronic signature to carry the same legal weight as a handwritten signature.&lt;ref name="Tuner-QualifiedESig-eIDAS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EU-eIDAS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeLex-QualESig"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Are Qualified Electronic Signatures? Are They by Definition Better than Other Types of Electronic Signatures?|url=http://timelex.eu/en/faq/categorie/electronic-signatures|publisher=Time.Lex|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rangalal Bandyopadhyay''' (Bengali: রঙ্গলাল বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়) (Born 1827 - died 13 May 1887) was a Bengali [[poet]], [[literary]], [[journalist]] and [[authors]].&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"&gt;[http://bn.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bandyopadhyay,_Rangalal Rangalal Bandyopadhyay]-[[Banglapedia]],Rangalal Bandyopadhyay National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
In 1827 Bandyopadhyay was born at Bakulia village, [[Burdwan district]]. His original home was in [[Hooghly district|Hooghly]], [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[সেলিনা হোসেন]] ও নুরুল ইসলাম সম্পাদিত; ''[[বাংলা একাডেমী]] চরিতাভিধান'';  ফেব্রুয়ারি,  ১৯৯৭; পৃষ্ঠা-৩৩৭, {{আইএসবিএন|984-07-4354-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost his father when just a child. After studying at a local school at Bakulia and missionary school, he entered to [[Hooghly Mohsin College]].&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"/&gt; He was fluent in [[Bengali language|Bangla]], [[English language|English]], and [[Sanskrit]] as well as [[Odia language|Oriya]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/KolikataKolpalata|title=Kolikata Kolpalata|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career life==
Bandyopadhyay's poems were first published in ''[[Sambad Prabhakar|Sangbad Prabhakar]]'', the magazine of [[Ishwar Chandra Gupta]]. He served as editor in both the monthly ''Sangbad Sagar'' in 1852 and the weekly ''Bartavaha'' published in 1856.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"/&gt; In 1855 Bandyopadhyay was appointed Assistant Editor of the newly published Education Gazette in which both his prose writings as well as poems were published. For some time in 1860 he taught Bangla [[Literature]] at [[Presidency College Calcutta]]. He joined government service and served variously as [[Income Tax]] Assessor, [[Deputy Collector]] and [[Deputy Magistrate]].

==Bibliography==
Bandyopadhyay's first, and perhaps most important, [[literary]] achievement is ''Padmini Upakhyan'' (1858), a [[historical]] romance of Rajput [[Rani Padmini]] based on Todd's Annals and Antiquities of [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=m1R2Pa3f7r0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Rangalal+Bandyopadhyay&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uqn8ZV_xEL&amp;sig=Zfg0K7UtZWsIfGP6elOmBV5JwE0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU7N-4tc7ZAhUDPY8KHampCAE4ChDoAQgoMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Rangalal%20Bandyopadhyay&amp;f=false|title=Modern Indian Literature, an Anthology: Surveys and poems|last=K.

In 1872 he rendered [[Kalidas]]'s ''Ritusanghar'' and ''Kumarsambhav'' into verse. His Nitikusumanjali is another poetical translation of [[Sanskrit]] poems. His Kalikata Kalpalata is considered to be the first [[historical]] work about [[Kolkata]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1882 he edited and published Mukundaram's Kavikankan Chandi. The other important books of this poem, which are varied in various fields of [[Bengali literature]], are:
*''Padmini Upakhyan'' (1858)
*''Karmadevi'' (1862)
*''Shurasundari'' (1868)
*''Kanchi Kaveri'' (1879)

==History of subvocalization research==
Subvocalization has been considered as far back as 1868.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;  Only in 1899 did an experiment take place to record movement of the [[larynx]] through silent reading by a researcher named Curtis, who concluded that silent reading was the only mental activity that created considerable movement of the larynx.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;
 
In 1950 Edfelt reached a breakthrough when he created an electrically powered instrument that can record movement.  He concluded that newer techniques are needed to accurately record information and that efforts should be made to understand this phenomenon instead of eliminating it.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;  After failed attempts trying to reduce silent speech in study participants, in 1952, it came to the conclusion that silent speech is a developmental activity which reinforces learning and should not be disrupted during [[Child development|development]]. In 1960, Edfelt seconded this opinion.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

==Techniques for studying subvocalization==
Subvocalization is commonly studied using [[electromyography]] (EMG) recordings,&lt;ref name=Locke&gt;Locke, J., &amp; Fehr, F. (1972). Subvocalization of Heard or Seen Words Prior to Spoken or Written Recall. The American Journal of Psychology, 8(1), 63-68.&lt;/ref&gt; concurrent speaking tasks,&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;Levy, B. A. (1971). Role of Articulation in Auditory and Visual Short-Term Memory. Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behaviour, 10, 123-132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Daneman&gt;Daneman, M., &amp; Newson, M. (1992). Assessing the Importance of Subvocalization in Normal Silent Reading. Reading and Writing: An Interdisciplinary Journal, 4, 55-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slowiaczek&gt;Slowiaczek, M., &amp; Clifton, C. (1980). Subvocalization and reading for meaning. Journal of Verbal Learning &amp; Verbal Behavior, 19.5, 573-582.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Speech shadowing|shadowing]],&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt;  and other techniques.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Daneman/&gt; 

EMG can be used to show the degree to which one is subvocalizing&lt;ref name=Locke/&gt; or to train subvocalization suppression.&lt;ref name=Cole&gt;Cole, R. A., &amp; Young, M. (1975). Effect of subvocalization on memory for speech sounds. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 1(6), 772-779.&lt;/ref&gt; EMG is used to record the electrical activity produced by the articulatory muscles involved in subvocalization. Greater electrical activity suggests a stronger use of subvocalization.&lt;ref name=Locke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; In the case of suppression training, the trainee is shown their own EMG recordings while attempting to decrease the movement of the articulatory muscles.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; The EMG recordings allows one to monitor and ideally reduce subvocalization.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt;

In concurrent speaking tasks, participants of a study are asked to complete an activity specific to the experiment while simultaneously repeating an irrelevant word.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; For example, one may be asked to read a paragraph while reciting the word "cola" over and over again.&lt;ref name=Slowiaczek/&gt; Speaking the repeated irrelevant word is thought to preoccupy the articulators used in subvocalization.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; Subvocalization, therefore, cannot be used in the mental processing of the activity being studied. Participants who had undergone the concurrent speaking task are often compared to other participants of the study who had completed the same activity without subvocalization interference. If performance on the activity is significantly less for those in the concurrent speaking task group than for those in the non-interference group, subvocalization is believed to play a role in the mental processing of that activity.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Daneman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Slowiaczek/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; The participants in the non-interference comparison group usually also complete a different, yet equally distracting task that does not involve the articulator muscles &lt;ref name=Daneman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt;(i.e. tapping). This ensures that the difference in performance between the two groups is in fact due to subvocalization disturbances and not due to things such as task difficulty or a divide in attention.&lt;ref name=Daneman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; 

Shadowing is conceptually similar to concurrent speaking tasks. Instead of repeating an irrelevant word, shadowing requires participants to listen to a list of words and to repeat those words as fast as possible while completing a separate task being studied by experimenters.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt;  

Techniques for subvocalization interference other may also include counting,&lt;ref name=Daneman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Slowiaczek/&gt; chewing &lt;ref name=Eiter/&gt; or locking one's jaw while placing the tongue on the roof of one's mouth.&lt;ref name=Eiter/&gt;

[[Subvocal recognition]] involves monitoring actual movements of the [[tongue]] and [[vocal cords]] that can be interpreted by [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] sensors. Through the use of electrodes and [[nanocircuitry]], synthetic telepathy could be achieved allowing people to communicate silently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://txchnologist.com/post/43496630304/temporary-tattoos-could-make-electronic-telepathy|title=Temporary Tattoos Could Make Electronic Telepathy, Telekinesis Possible|website=Txchnologist.com|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary background==
The exploration into the evolutionary background of subvocalization is currently very limited. The little known is predominantly about language acquisition and memory. Evolutionary psychologists suggest that the development of subvocalization is related to [[Modularity of mind|modular]] aspects of the brain.&lt;ref name=evolution&gt;Buller, D. J. (2005). ''Adapting Minds: Evolutionary Psychology and the Persistent Quest for Human Nature''. Massachusetts: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a great amount of exploration on the evolutionary basis of [[universal grammar]].&lt;ref name=evolution/&gt; The idea is that although the specific language one initially learns is dependent on one's culture, all languages are learned through the activation of universal "language modules" that are present in each of us.&lt;ref name=evolution/&gt; This concept of a modular mind is a prevalent idea that will help explore memory and its relation to language more clearly, and possibly illuminate the evolutionary basis of subvocalization. Evidence for the mind having modules for superior function is the example that hours may be spent toiling over a car engine in an attempt to flexibly formulate a solution, but, in contrast, extremely long and complex sentences can be comprehended, understood, related and responded to in seconds.&lt;ref name=evolution/&gt; The specific inquiry into subvocalization may be minimal right now but there is a lot to investigate in regard to the modular mind.

==Associated brain structures and processes==
The brain mechanics of subvocalization are still not well understood. It is safe to say that more than one part of the brain is used, and that no single test can reveal all the relevant processes.  Studies often use [[event-related potential]]s; brief changes in an EEG ([[electroencephalography]]) to show brain activation, or [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRIs]].

Subvocalization is related to inner speech; when we use inner speech there is bilateral activation in predominantly the [[Frontal lobe|left frontal lobe]].&lt;ref name=brainstructures&gt;Girbau, D. (2007). A Neurocognitive Approach to the Study of Private Speech. ''The Spanish Journal of Psychology'', ''10''(1), 41-51&lt;/ref&gt; This activation could suggest that the frontal lobes may be involved in [[motor planning]] for speech output.&lt;ref name=brainstructures/&gt;

Subvocal rehearsal is controlled by [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down processing]];&lt;ref name=brainstructures/&gt; conceptually driven, it relies on information already in memory.&lt;ref name=brainstructures2&gt;Klob, B. &amp; Whishaw, I.Q. (2009). ‘’Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology’’ (6th ed.). New York, NY: Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence for significant left hemisphere activation in the [[Inferior frontal gyrus|inferior]] and [[Middle frontal gyrus|middle frontal gyri]] and inferior parietal gyrus during subvocal rehearsal.&lt;ref name="brainstructures"/&gt; [[Broca's area]] has also been found to have activation in other studies exploring subvocal rehearsal.&lt;ref name=brainstructures3&gt;Burgess, N. &amp; Hitch, G. J. (1999). Memory for Serial Order: A Network Model of the Phonological Loop and its Timing. ''Psychological Review'', ''106''(3), 551-581&lt;/ref&gt;

Silent speech-reading and silent counting are also examined when experimenters look at subvocalization. These tasks show activation in the frontal cortices, [[hippocampus]] and the [[thalamus]] for silent counting.&lt;ref name=brainstructures/&gt; Silent-reading activates similar areas of the [[Primary auditory cortex|auditory cortex]] that are involved in listening.&lt;ref name=brainstructures/&gt;
    
Finally, the [[Baddeley's model of working memory|phonological loop]]; proposed by Baddeley and Hitch as “being responsible for temporary storage of speech-like information”&lt;ref name=brainstructure4&gt;Baddeley, A., Eysenck, M. W. &amp; Anderson, M. C. (2009). ''Memory''. New York, NY: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; is an active subvocal rehearsal mechanism, activation originating mostly in the left hemispheric speech areas: Broca's, lateral and medial premotor cortices and the [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref name=brainstructures5&gt;Gruber, O. (2001). Effects of Domain-specific Interference on Brain Activation Associated with Verbal Working Memory Task Performance. ''Cerebral Cortex'', ''11'', 1047-1055&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of subvocalization in memory processes==
===The phonological loop and rehearsal===
{{further|Phonological loop}}

The ability to store verbal material in [[working memory]], and the storage of verbal material in [[short-term memory]] relies on a phonological loop.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; This loop, proposed by Baddeley and Hitch, represents a system that is composed of a short-term store in which memory is represented [[phonology|phonologically]], and a rehearsal process. This rehearsal preserves and refreshes the material by re-enacting it and re-presenting it to short-term storage, and subvocalization is a major component of this rehearsal.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; The phonological loop system features an interaction between subvocal rehearsal and specific storage for phonological material.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;  The phonological loop contributes to the study of the role of subvocalization and the inner voice in auditory imagery.&lt;ref name=Hubbard&gt;Hubbard, T.L. (2010). Auditory imagery: empirical findings. ''Psychological Bulletin, 136(2)'', 302-329.&lt;/ref&gt; Subvocalization and the phonological loop interact in a non-dependent manner demonstrated by their differential requirements on different tasks.&lt;ref name=Hubbard/&gt; The role of subvocalization within the workings of memory processes is heavily reliant on its involvement with Baddeley's proposed phonological loop.

===Working memory===
{{further|Working memory}}

There have been findings that support a role of subvocalization in the mechanisms underlying working memory and the holding of information in an accessible and malleable state. Some forms of internal speech-like processing may function as a holding mechanism in immediate memory tasks.&lt;ref name="Standing1980"&gt;Standing, L., Bond, B., Smith, P., Isley, C. (1980). Is the immediate memory span determined by subvocalization rate? ''British Journal of Psychology, 71(4)'', 535-539&lt;/ref&gt; The working memory span is a behavioural measure of “exceptional consistency” &lt;ref name="Standing1989"&gt;Standing, L., &amp; Curtis, L. (1989). Subvocalization rate versus other predictors of the memory span. ''Psychological Reports,65(2)'', 487-495.&lt;/ref&gt; and is a positive function of the rate of subvocalization. Experimental data has shown that this span size increases as the rate of subvocalization increases, and the time needed to subvocalize the number of items comprising a span is generally constant.&lt;ref name="Standing1980"/&gt; [[fMRI]] data suggests that a sequence of five letters approaches the individual capacity for immediate [[Recollection|recall]] that relies on subvocal rehearsal alone.&lt;ref name=Logie&gt;Logie, R.H., Venneri, A., Sala, S.D., Redpath, T.W., Marshall, I. (2003). Brain activation and the phonological loop: the impact of rehearsal. ''Brain and Cognition, 53(2)'', 293-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Short-term memory===
{{further|Short-term memory}}

The role of subvocal rehearsal is also seen in short-term memory.  Research has confirmed that this form of rehearsal benefits some [[cognition|cognitive]] functioning.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; Subvocal movements that occur when people listen to or rehearse a series of speech sounds will help the subject to maintain the [[phoneme|phonemic]] representation of these sounds in their short-term memory, and this finding is supported by the fact that interfering with the overt production of speech sound did not disrupt the encoding of the sound's features in short term memory.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; This suggests a strong role played by subvocalization in the encoding of speech sounds into short-term memory.  It has also been found that language differences in short-term memory performance in bilingual people is mediated, but not exclusively, by subvocal rehearsal.&lt;ref name=Thorn&gt;Thorn, A. S. C., &amp; Gathercole, S. E. (2001). Language differences in verbal short-term memory do not exclusively originate in the process of subvocal rehearsal. ''Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 8(2)'', 357-364.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of acoustic errors in short-term memory is also thought to be, in part, due to subvocalization.&lt;ref name=Glassman&gt;Glassman, W.E. (1972). Subvocal activity and acoustic confusions in short-term memory. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology, 96(1)'', 164-169.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who stutter and therefore have a slower rate of subvocal articulation &lt;ref name="Bosshardt 1990"&gt;Bosshardt, H. (1990). Subvocalization and reading rate differences between stuttering and nonstuttering children and adults. ''Journal of Speech and Hearing Research, 3''”, 776-785.&lt;/ref&gt; also demonstrate a short-term reproduction of serial material that is slower as compared to people who do not stutter.&lt;ref name=Bosshardt&gt;Bosshardt, H. (1993). Differences between stutterers and nonstutterers short-term recall and recognition performance.”Journal of Speech &amp; Hearing Research, 36(2)”, 286-293.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encoding===
Subvocalization plays a large role in memory [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]]. Subvocalization appears to facilitate the translating of visual linguistic information into acoustic information &lt;ref name=Levy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eiter/&gt; and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Locke"/&gt; For example, subvocalization occurs when one sees a word and is asked to say it (see-say condition), or when one hears a word and is asked to write it (hear-write condition), but not when one is asked to see a word and then write it (see-write condition) or hear and word and then say it (hear-say condition).&lt;ref name=Locke/&gt; The see-say condition converts visual information into acoustic information. The hear-write condition converts acoustic information into visual information. The see-write and hear-say conditions, however, remain in the same sensory domain and do not require translation into a different type of code.&lt;ref name=Locke/&gt;

This is also supported by findings that suggest that subvocalization is not required for the encoding of speech,&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eiter&gt;Eiter, B., &amp; Inhoff, A. (2010). Visual Word Recognition During Reading by Subvocal Articulation. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 35(2), 457-470.&lt;/ref&gt; as words being heard are already in acoustic form and therefore enter short term memory directly without use of subvocal articulation.&lt;ref name=Eiter/&gt; Furthermore, subvocalization interference impedes reading comprehension but not listening comprehension.&lt;ref name=Slowiaczek/&gt;

==Role in reading comprehension==
Subvocalization's role in reading comprehension can be viewed as a function of task complexity. Subvocalization is involved minimally or not at all in immediate comprehension.&lt;ref name=Aaronson&gt;Aaronson, D., &amp; Ferres, S. (1986). Reading Strategies for Children and Adults: A Quantitative Model. Psychological Review, 93(1), 89-112.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, subvocalization is not used in the making of homophone judgements (are heir and air homophones?) &lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; but is used more for the comprehension of sentences and even more still for the comprehension of paragraphs.&lt;ref name="Daneman"/&gt; Subvocalization, which translates visual reading information into a more durable and flexible acoustic code &lt;ref name=Bad&gt;Baddeley, A., Eldridge, M., &amp; Lewis, V. (1981). The role of subvocalisation in reading.. The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology A: Human Experimental Psychology, 33(4), 439-454&lt;/ref&gt; is thought to allow for the integration of past concepts with those currently being processed.&lt;ref name=Slowiaczek/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aaronson/&gt;

==Comparison to speed reading==
Advocates of [[speed reading]] generally claim that subvocalization places extra burden on the cognitive resources, thus, slowing the reading down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/academic-resources/cwlt/classes/accelerated-reading/subvocalization/ |title=Subvocalization |work=Accelerated Reading |author=Charlotte Emigh |publisher=University of Puget Sound Center for Writing, Learning &amp; Teaching |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speedreading courses often prescribe lengthy practices to eliminate subvocalizing when reading. Normal reading instructors often simply apply remedial teaching to a reader who subvocalizes to the degree that they make visible movements on the [[lip]]s, [[jaw]], or [[throat]].&lt;ref name=mcwhorter /&gt;

Furthermore, fMRI studies comparing fast and slow readers (during a reading task) indicate that between the two groups there are significant differences in the brain areas being activated. In particular, it was found that rapid readers show lower activation in the brain regions associated with speech, which indicates that the higher speeds were attained, in part, by the reduction in subvocalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0-9934964-0-0|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cEFKjwEACAAJ&amp;dq=ultimate+study+method|date=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the slower rates (memorizing, [[learning]], and reading for [[reading comprehension|comprehension]]), subvocalizing by the reader is very detectable. At the faster rates of reading ([[Skimming (reading)|skimming]] and scanning), subvocalization is less detectable. For competent readers, subvocalizing to some extent even at scanning rates is normal.&lt;ref name=mcwhorter&gt;McWhorter, K. (2002) Efficient and Flexible Reading. Longman&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, subvocalizing is an inherent part of reading and understanding a word. Micro-muscle tests suggest that full and permanent elimination of subvocalizing is impossible. This may originate in the way people learn to read by associating the [[Visual perception|sight]] of words with their spoken sounds. Sound associations for words are indelibly imprinted on the [[nervous system]]&amp;mdash;even of [[deaf]] people, since they will have associated the word with the mechanism for causing the sound or a sign in a particular [[sign language]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

At the slower [[Reading (activity)#Reading rate|reading rates]] (100–300 words per minute), subvocalizing may improve comprehension.&lt;ref name=rayner /&gt; Subvocalizing or actual vocalizing can indeed be of great help when one wants to learn a passage verbatim. This is because the person is repeating the information in an auditory way, as well as seeing the piece on the paper.

==Auditory imagery==
{{further|Auditory imagery}}

The definition of auditory imagery is analogous to definitions used in other modalities of imagery (such as visual, auditory and olfactory imagery) in that it is, according to Intons-Peterson (1992), “the introspective persistence of an auditory experience, including one constructed from components drawn from long-term memory, in the absence of direct sensory instigation of that experience.”. Auditory imagery is often but not necessarily influenced by subvocalization,&lt;ref name=Hubbard/&gt; and has ties to the rehearsal process of working memory.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; The conception of working memory relies on a relationship between the "inner ear" and the "inner voice" (subvocalization), and this memory system is posited to be at the basis of auditory imagery. Subvocalization and the phonological store work in partnership in many auditory imagery tasks.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

The extent to which an auditory image can influence detection, encoding and recall of a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] through its relationships to perception and memory has been documented.&lt;ref name=Hubbard/&gt; It has been suggested that auditory imagery may slow the decay of memory for [[pitch (music)|pitch]], as demonstrated by T. A. Keller, Cowan, and Saults (1995) &lt;ref name=Hubbard/&gt; who demonstrated that the prevention of rehearsal resulted in decreased memory performance for pitch comparison tasks through the introduction of distracting and competing stimuli. It has also been reported that auditory imagery for verbal material is impaired when subvocalization is blocked.&lt;ref name=Aleman&gt;Aleman, A., &amp; vant Wout, M. (2004). Subvocalization in auditory-verbal imagery: Just a form of motor imagery? ''Cognitive Processing, 5(4)'', 228-231.&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that subvocalization is common to both auditory imagery and rehearsal.

In objection to a subvocalization mechanism basis for auditory imagery is in the fact that a significant amount of auditory imagery does not involve [[speech]] or stimuli similar to speech, such as music and environmental sounds.&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;Pitt, M. A., &amp; Crowder, R. G. (1992). The role of spectral and dynamic cues in imagery for musical timbre. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology:Human Perception and Performance, 18'', 728–738.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, to combat this point, it has been suggested that rehearsal of non-speech sounds can indeed be carried out by the phonological mechanisms previously mentioned, even if the creation of nonspeech sounds within this mechanism isn't possible.&lt;ref name=Baddeley&gt;Baddeley, A. D., &amp; Logie, R. H. (1992). Auditory imagery and working memory. In D. Reisberg (Ed.), ''Auditory imagery'' pp. 179–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in speech==
There are two general types of individuals when it comes to subvocalization.  There are Low-Vocalizers and High-Vocalizers.&lt;ref name=Speech1&gt;Aarons, L. (1971). Subvocalization: Aural and emg feedback in reading. ‘’Perceptual and Motor Skills’’, ‘’33’’(1), 271-306&lt;/ref&gt;  Using [[electromyography]] to record the muscle action potential of the larynx (i.e. muscle movement of the larynx), an individual is categorized under a high or low vocalizer depending on how much muscle movement the muscles in the larynx undergo during silent reading.

===Regulation of speech intensity===
Often in both high and low vocalizers, the rate of speech is constantly regulated depending on intensity/volume of words (said to be affected by long delays between readings) and increasing the delay of speech and hearing ones' voice is an effect called “delayed auditory feedback”.&lt;ref name=Speech1/&gt;  Increasing the voice intensity while reading was found to be higher in low-vocalizers than high-vocalizers.&lt;ref name=Speech1/&gt;  It is believed that because high-vocalizers have greater muscle movement of the larynx during silent reading, low-vocalizers read louder to compensate for this lack of movement so they can understand the material.&lt;ref name=Speech1/&gt;  When individuals undergo “feedback training”, where they are conscious of these muscle movements, this difference diminishes.&lt;ref name=Speech1/&gt;

===Role in articulation===
{{further|Manner of articulation|l1=Articulation}}

Articulation during silent speech is important, though speech is not solely dependent on articulation alone.  Impairing articulation can reduce sensory input from the muscle movements of the larynx to the brain to understand information being read and it also impaires on-going speech production during reading to direct thinking.&lt;ref name=Speech1/&gt; Words that are of high similarity minimizes articulation causing interference and may reduce subvocal rehearsal.&lt;ref name=Speech2&gt;Glassman, W. E. (1972). Subvocal activity and acoustic confusions in short-term memory. ‘’Journal of Experimental Psychology’’, ‘’96’’(1), 164-169.&lt;/ref&gt; As articulation of similar words is effecting subvocalization, there is an increase in acoustic errors for short term memory and recall.&lt;ref name=Speech2/&gt;

Impairing or suppressing articulation causes a greater impact on performance.&lt;ref name=Speech3&gt;Neath, I. (2000). Modeling the effects of irrelevant speech on memory. ''Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review'', ''7''(3), 403-423.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of articulation suppression is repeating the same word over many times such as ' ''the'' ' and attempting to memorise other words into short term memory. Even though primary cues may be given for these words in attempt to retrieve them, words will either be recalled for the incorrect cue or will not be recalled at all &lt;ref name=Speech3/&gt;

==Schizophrenia and subvocalization==
[[Schizophrenics]] known to experience auditory [[hallucination]]s could show the result of over-activation of the muscles in the larynx.&lt;ref name=schizophrenia&gt;Green, M. F., &amp; Kinsbourne, M. (1990). Subvocal activity and auditory hallucinations: Clues for behavioral treatments?. ''Schizophrenia Bulletin'', ''16''(4), 617-625.&lt;/ref&gt;  Using an electromyography to record muscle movement, individuals experiencing hallucinations showed greater muscle activation before these hallucinations occurred.&lt;ref name=schizophrenia/&gt;  Unfortunately, this muscle activation is not easily detected which means the muscle movement must be measured on a wider range.&lt;ref name=schizophrenia/&gt;
Though a wider range is needed to detect the muscle movement, it is still considered as subvocalization.  Much more research is needed to link subvocalization with hallucination but many schizophrenics report "hearing voices" (as hallucinations) coming from their throat.&lt;ref name=schizophrenia2&gt;Smith, J. D., Wilson, M., &amp; Reisberg, D. (1995). The role of subvocalization in auditory imagery. ''Neuropsychologia'', ''33''(11), 1433-1454. doi:10.1016/0028-3932(95)00074-D&lt;/ref&gt;  This small fact could be a clue to finding if there is a true link between subvocalization and hallucinations, but it is very difficult to see this connection because not many patients experience hallucinations.&lt;ref name=schizophrenia/&gt;

'''Sumathendra Raghavendra Nadig''' (4 May 1935 - 7 August 2018) was an Indian professor and writer. Nadig came upon the literary scene as a prominent modern poet in the 1960s. He was a close associate of Gopalakrishna Adiga, the leader of the modernist movement.

Nadig's "Dampatya Gita" has been translated into English, Hindi, Bengali and other Indian languages. His other major poem, "Panchabhut", is considered to be an important and original contribution to modern Indian literature. His poetic achievement has been acknowledged by great poets including Gopalakrishna Adiga, Pu. Ti. Narasimhachar, Ayyappa Panikar, Sitanshu Yashaschandra, Manohar Rai Sardesai, and G. S. Shivrudrappa; writers including S. L. Bhyrappa and U. R. Anantha
Murthy; and scholars including [[Kapila Vatsyayan]] and Sibnarayan Ray.

Nadig had two master's degrees in English, one from Mysore University and the other from Temple University (US). He also received a PhD in Kannada from Bangalore University and an honorary doctorate, "Shabda Marthand", from Gurukul Kangri University, Hardwar.

He had received many awards, including the Karnataka Rajyothsava Prashsti, Dinakara Pratisthana Prashasti, V. M. Inamdar
Prashsti, and M.V.Si. Puraskara.

He was the Chairman of National Book Trust from 1996 to 1999.

He was well known for his critical studies of Bendre, K.S. Narasimha Swamy and Adiga, and short stories and nursery rhymes, and translations from Bengali to Kannada, and from Kannada to English. He knew Kannada, English, Hindi, Marathi, Konkani, and Bengali.

"Poetry makes strange things happen. I reach the society in me, and the society meets me in my poetry."&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5916">'''''The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing: For writers, editors, and speakers''''' was first published in 1980 by [[Casey Miller]] and [[Kate Swift]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Casey, and Kate Swift. The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing: For writers, editors and speakers (2nd ed.). New York: Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc., 1980 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second book produced by the two in an effort to raise awareness of issues concerning gender in the [[English language]].

== "''Man'' as a False Generic"  ==
The first section of the handbook is entitled "''Man'' as a False Generic." False generics are defined as "terms used of a class or group that are not applicable to all its members."&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Swift, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; A brief history of the subject describes the origin of 'man' to mean "person" or "human being," but observes that this broad definition of 'man' was becoming questionable in the 1980s. "Because gender in modern English corresponds to sex or its absence, native speakers of the language increasingly sense the same contradiction in calling women 'men' that they would feel in calling girls 'boys'  or daughters 'sons.'"&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Swift, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

They give the following as an example for where the generic use of 'man' is not applicable:
"One author, ostensibly generalizing about all human beings, wrote:
'As for man, he is no different from the rest. His back aches, he ruptures easily, his women have difficulties in childbirth...'
If ''man'' and ''he'' were truly generic, the parallel phrase would have been "he has difficulties in childbirth."&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Swift, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Swift and Miller offer a list of substitute titles for words including man such as 'salesman' or 'fisherman.' They also suggest using synonyms for words that refer to gender, such as 'man the station,' and so on.

== "The Pronoun Problem" ==
This section goes into detail about the history and problems that arise from using male pronouns as generic pronouns (i.e. "he," "him," and "his"). They offer this section from a ''New York Times'' response to an article in support of gendered pronouns to be used generically:

"Knowing that ''he'' and ''his'' can be gender neutral, I shall no longer feel there is an odd image filtering through something like: 'The average American needs the small routines of getting ready for work. As he shaves or blow-dries his hair or pulls on his panty hose, he is easing himself by small stages into the demands of the day.'...How liberating common sense can be."&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Swift, p. 45-6&lt;/ref&gt;

As a solution to this issue of pronouns, Swift and Miller suggest using 'they' in place of a gendered pronoun, or specifically stating "he or she/his or hers" as a substitute for just the male pronoun.

== "Generalizations" ==
The 'Generalizations' section describes the reverse of the 'Pronoun Problem' - it is when gender neutral terms are assumed to be gender specific. Often, the gender assumed is male. This section also describes problems with the use of female-gendered words in ways that are condescending, but may not be intentional. As an example, they offer this statement about a fictional television show: 
"Powerful lady attorney and confident young lawyer team up to defend a wealthy contractor accused of murder."

Using "lady" in this way implies that the 'confident young lawyer' and the 'wealthy contractor' are both male, and also suggests that a woman needs to be explicitly described as powerful. They go on to urge that qualifiers not be used with just women, and instead suggest that the above statement read:

"Powerful attorney and her young male colleague team up to defend a wealthy businessman accused of murder."&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Swift, p. 66-7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other ideas/topics ==
The ''Handbook'' includes suggestions on how to avoid sexist language. The recurring theme is using inclusive language that is not gender biased. Miller and Swift offer a historical account of how language norms have developed in the English language, and then suggest alternatives that do not make gender assumptions.

"A Few More Words" is a chapter that includes in depth case studies on specific words such as "Feminist," "Hero/Heroine," and "Midwife." These sections offer a detailed history of specific words and phrases, and put them in gendered context.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Swift, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Handbook'' also contains a brief thesaurus of terms to use in place of terms that are not gender neutral. Examples include 'married woman' instead of 'matron' and 'person/individual' instead of 'man' when meant to mean "person."&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Swift, p. 158-9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==

Casey Miller and Kate Swift have been advocating for gender-inclusive language since the early 1970s, when they wrote the essay, "Desexing the English Language." Their intent in ''The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing'' was "to give people the background, to make them aware of what was happening right underneath their noses...we didn’t want to tell people, Do This or Don’t Do That!”&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, William. The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; Due in large part to their work on the topic, by 1980 when ''The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing'' was written the movement supporting non-sexist language was gaining traction.

Nearly 20 years after its publication, the ''Handbook'' was still considered the standard reference book on how to avoid degrading women with words.&lt;ref&gt;Van Nes, Claudia. “Enemy of Sexist Language.” The Courant. January 6, 1997. http://articles.courant.com/1997-01-06/news/9701060134_1_first-book-casey-miller-ms-miller&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as an example of unbiased review on the topic of gendered and sexist language.

The dialects of the [[Tafresh]] region share many features with the Central Plateau dialects.

==Grammar==
Vafsi Tati has six short vowel phonemes, five long vowel phonemes and two nasal vowel phonemes. The consonant inventory is basically the same as in [[Persian language|Persian]].
Nouns are inflected for gender (masculine, feminine), number (singular, plural) and case (direct, oblique).

The oblique case marks the possessor (preceding the head noun), the definite direct object, nouns governed by a preposition, and the subject of transitive verbs in the past tense.
Personal pronouns are inflected for number (singular, plural) and case (direct, oblique).
A set of enclitic pronouns is used to indicate the agent of transitive verbs in the past tenses.

There are two demonstrative pronouns: one for near deixis, one for remote deixis.
The use of the Persian ezafe construction is spreading, however there is also a native possessive construction, consisting of the possessor (unmarked or marked by the oblique case) preceding the head noun.

The verbal inflection is based on two stems: present and past stem. Person and number are indicated personal suffixes attached to the stem. In the transitive past tense the verb consists of the bare past stem and personal concord with the subject is provided by enclitic pronouns following the stem or a constituent preceding the verb. Two modal prefixes are used to convey modal and aspectual information. The past participle is employed in the formation of compound tenses.

Vafsi Tati is a split ergative language: Split ergativity means that a language has in one domain accusative morphosyntax and in another domain ergative morphosyntax. In Vafsi the present tense is structured the accusative way and the past tense is structured the ergative way. Accusative morphosyntax means that in a language subjects of intransitive and transitive verbs are treated the same way and direct objects are treated another way. Ergative morphosyntax means that in a language subjects of intransitive verbs and direct objects are treated one way and subjects of transitive verbs are treated another way.

In the Vafsi past tense subjects of intransitive verbs and direct objects are marked by the direct case whereas subjects of transitive verbs are marked by the oblique case. This feature characterizes the Vafsi past tense as ergative.

The unmarked order of constituents is SOV like in most other Iranian languages.

'''West Uvean''' (also '''Uvean''' or '''Faga Ouvéa'''; ''Fagauvea'' in the vernacular) is a [[Polynesian language|Polynesian]] [[Polynesian outlier|outlier language]] spoken on the island of [[Ouvéa]], in the [[Loyalty Islands|Loyalty]] island group of [[New Caledonia]], and in the capital of Nouméa. It has long been in contact with [[Iaai language|Iaai]], the [[Southern Oceanic languages|Southern Oceanic language]] also spoken on the same island. Consequently, four vowels have been added, and the syllable structure has become complex, allowing for final consonants.&lt;ref name=Button&gt;{{cite book|title=Language contact and change in the Austronesian world|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|date=1994|author1=Button, Tom|author2=Tryon, Darell T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|534}}

West Uvea is the only Polynesian language to use a [[quinary]] numeral system. It is probably the original decimal Polynesian people influenced by the nearby [[Iaai people]] who used a quinary numeral system, and changed from a decimal system to a quinary one. There are two sets of numerals from 11 to 20, the second way was the archaic form. The word 'tupu' means 'sum', 'teanua' in 'tahi a teanua' means 'human body', 'nea' in 'tahi enea' means 'man'. Nowadays, the West Uvea or Faga Uvea people use [[French language|French]] or [[Iaai language|Iaai]] numeral systems more frequently.

==Name==
The speakers designate their language by the name '''Fagauvea''', which is also the name used in French.
The name ''West Uvean'' sometimes used in English is meant to distinguish the language from the related ''East Uvean'' or [[Wallisian language|Wallisian]], spoken on [[Wallis Island]] ({{okina}}Uvea).

'''Zener cards''' are cards used to conduct [[experiment]]s for [[extrasensory perception]] (ESP) or [[clairvoyance]]. Perceptual [[psychologist]] [[Karl Zener]] (1903–1964) designed the cards in the early 1930s for experiments conducted with his colleague, [[parapsychologist]] [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]] (1895–1980).{{R|"About"}} The original series of experiments have been discredited and replication has proved elusive.

==Overview==
[[File:Hubert Pearce with J. B. Rhine.png|thumb|[[Hubert Pearce]] with [[Joseph Banks Rhine]].]]

The Zener cards are a deck of twenty five cards, five of each symbol. The five symbols are: a hollow circle, a plus sign, three vertical wavy lines, a hollow square, and a hollow five-pointed star.{{R|"hines115"}}{{R|"jarvis"}} They are used to test for ESP.

In a test for ESP, the experimenter picks up a card in a shuffled pack, observes the symbol, and records the answer of the person being tested, who would guess which of the five designs is on the card. The experimenter continues until all the cards in the pack are tested.

Poor [[shuffling]] methods can make the order of cards in the deck easier to predict{{R|"Skepdic"}} and the cards could have been inadvertently or intentionally marked and manipulated.{{R|"sladek"}} In his experiments, [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]] first shuffled the cards by hand but later decided to use a machine for shuffling.{{R|"pigliucci"}}

In his book, ''The New Apocrypha'', [[John Sladek]] expressed incredulity at the tests stating, "It's astonishing that playing cards should have been chosen for ESP research at all. They are, after all, the instrument of stage magicians and second-dealing gamblers; they can be marked and manipulated in many traditional ways. At the best of times, card-shuffling is a poor way of getting a random distribution of symbols."{{R|"sladek"}}

Rhine's experiments with Zener cards were discredited due to [[sensory leakage]] or cheating. Such as the subject being able to read the symbols from slight indentations on the back of the cards and being able to see and hear the experimenter to not facial expressions and breathing patterns.{{R|"smith"}}

[[Terence Hines]] has written of the original experiments:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The methods the Rhines used to prevent subjects from gaining hints and clues as to the design on the cards were far from adequate. In many experiments, the cards were displayed face up, but hidden behind a small wooden shield. Several ways of obtaining information about the design on the card remain even in the presence of the shield. For instance, the subject may be able sometimes to see the design on the face-up card reflected in the agent’s glasses. Even if the agent isn’t wearing glasses it is possible to see the reflection in his cornea.{{R|"hines119"}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Once Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods, he was unable to find any high-scoring subjects.{{R|"Christopher"}}

[[James Alcock]] notes that, "Despite Rhine’s confidence that he had established the reality of extrasensory perception, he had not done so. Methodological problems with his experiments eventually came to light, and as a result parapsychologists no longer run card-guessing studies and rarely even refer to Rhine’s work."{{R|"alcock"}}

The chemist [[Irving Langmuir]] called Rhine's experiments an example of ''[[pathological science]]'' - the science of things that aren't so - and criticized its practitioners not as dishonest people but as ones that have sufficiently fooled themselves.{{R|"park"}}

During [[James Randi]]'s TV special "Exploring Psychic Powers Live!" a psychic was tested on a deck of 250 Zener cards and was only able to predict 50 of them correctly, which is the expected result of random guessing the cards.{{R|"Live!"}}

In 2016 [[Massimo Polidoro]] tested an Italian mother and daughter that were claiming a 90% and above success rate of psychic transmission using Zener cards. Upon restricting them from seeing each other's faces and to the use of a silent writing method their success rate dropped to no better than chance. The women were cognizant of the fact that they required visual contact to achieve transmission of the symbols saying, "This kind of understanding is so natural to us, all this attention to us is also very surprising. There are no tricks, but surely we understand each other with looks. It always happens."{{R|Polidoro}}

==Statistics==

[[File:Standard deviation diagram.svg|right|Standard deviation diagram]]

The results of many tests using Zener cards fit with a typical [[normal distribution]].

[[Probability]] predicts these test results for a test of 25 questions with five possible answers if chance is operating:

Most people (79%) will get between 3 and 7 correct (probability is a more precise calculation).

The probability of guessing 8 or more correctly is 10.9% (in a group of 25, you can  expect several scores in this range by chance).

The chances of getting 15 correct is about 1 in 90,000.

Guessing 20 out of 25 has a probability of about 1 in 5 billion.

Guessing all 25 correct has a chance of (.2) = 3.3 x 10, or about 1 in 300 [[quadrillion]].{{R|"normal"}}

Rather than applying [[Ockham's razor]] and accepting the [[null hypothesis]] for non-results parapsychology has invented many ''[[Post hoc theorizing|post-hoc]]'' constructions to explain away failure, for example:{{R|"alcock2003"}}
#The psi-experimenater effect - The influence of certain experimenters own psi-abilities, or lack thereof, having a positive or negative effect on the results
#The sheep-goat effect - It's observed that believers in psi-phenomena are more likely to report positive outcomes to experiments
#The psi-missing effect - Invoked when results deviate in a statistically significant way in the direction not predicted
#The decline effect - The regression to the mean over time is taken as a property of psi rather than a statistical eventuality
