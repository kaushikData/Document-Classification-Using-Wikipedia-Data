The '''{{IAST|Abhisamayālaṅkāra}}''' "Ornament of/for Realization[s]", abbreviated '''AA''', is one of five [[Sanskrit]]-language [[Mahayana sutras]] which, according to Tibetan tradition, [[Maitreya]] revealed to [[Asanga|Asaṅga]] in northwest India circa the 4th century AD. (Chinese tradition recognizes a different list of Maitreya texts which does not include the AA.) Those who doubt the claim of supernatural revelation disagree (or are unsure) whether the text was composed by Asaṅga himself, or by someone else, perhaps a human teacher of his. 

The AA is never mentioned by [[Xuanzang]], who spent several years at [[Nalanda]] in India during the early 7th century, and became a savant in the Maitreya-Asaṅga tradition. One possible explanation is that the text is late and attributed to Maitreya-Asaṅga for purposes of legitimacy. The question then hinges on the dating of the earliest extant AA commentaries, those of [[Arya Vimuktisena]] (usually given as 6th century, following possibly unreliable information from [[Taranatha]])&lt;ref&gt;See ch. 9 of Makransky.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Haribhadra (Buddhist philosopher)|Haribhadra]] (late 8th century).

The AA contains eight chapters and 273 verses. Its pithy contents summarize—in the form of eight categories and seventy topics—the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā sūtras]] which the [[Madhyamaka]] philosophical school regards as presenting the ultimate truth. [[Gareth Sparham]] and [[John Makransky]] believe the text to be commenting on the version in 25,000 lines, although it does not explicitly say so. Haribhadra, whose commentary is based on the 8,000-line PP Sūtra, held that the AA is commenting on all PP versions at once (i.e. the 100,000-line, 25,000-line, and 8,000-line versions),&lt;ref name="Sparham, AA vol. 1, p. xiv"&gt;Sparham, AA vol. 1, p. xiv; Makransky, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; and this interpretation has generally prevailed within the commentarial tradition.

Several scholars liken the AA to a "table of contents" for the PP.&lt;ref&gt;Among them are Edward Conze (''The PP Literature,'' p. 104) and James Apple (''Stairway to Nirvana,'' p. 49.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Conze]] admits that the correspondence between these numbered topics, and the contents of the PP is "not always easy to see...";&lt;ref&gt;From his Preface to the ''Large Sutra''p. x&lt;/ref&gt; and that the fit is accomplished "not without some violence" to the text.&lt;ref&gt;From his AA translation, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The AA is widely held to reflect the hidden meaning (sbed don) of the PP, with the implication being that its details are not found there explicitly. (Sparham traces this tradition to Haribhadra's student Dharmamitra.) &lt;ref&gt;Sparham, AA vol. 1, p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; One noteworthy effect is to recast PP texts as path literature. Philosophical differences may also be identified. Conze and Makransky see the AA as an attempt to reinterpret the PP, associated with Mādhyamaka tenets, in the direction of [[Yogacara]].&lt;ref&gt;Conze, ''The PP Literature,'' p. 104; Makransky, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AA is studied by all lineages of Tibetan Buddhism, and is one of five principal works studied in the [[geshe]] curriculum of the major [[Gelug]] monasteries. [[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]] has suggested that the text's prominence in the Tibetan tradition, but not elsewhere, may be due to the existence of the aforementioned commentary by Haribhadra, who was the disciple of [[Śāntarakṣita]], an influential early Indian missionary to Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;In his "Overview..." (cited below), second sentence.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Je Tsongkhapa]]'s writings name the AA as the root text of the [[lamrim]] tradition founded by [[Atiśa]].

[[Georges Dreyfus]] reports that "Ge-luk monastic universities... take the ''Ornament'' as the central text for the study of the path; they treat it as a kind of Buddhist encyclopedia, read in the light of commentaries by Je Dzong-ka-ba, [[Gyaltsab Je|Gyel-tsap Je]], and the authors of manuals [monastic textbooks]. Sometimes these commentaries spin out elaborate digressions from a single word of the ''Ornament.''"&lt;ref&gt;''...Two Hands Clapping, pp. 175-176.&lt;/ref&gt; Dreyfus adds that non-Gelug schools give less emphasis to the AA, but study a somewhat larger number of works (including the other texts of the Maitreya-Asanga corpus) in correspondingly less detail.

==Title of the work==
[[File:Tibetan - Buddha Shakyamuni and Prajnaparamita - Walters W8561.jpg|thumb|centre|600px|13th century Tibetan PP manuscript with images of Shakyamuni Buddha and the goddess Prajñāpāramita. Photo: Walters Art Museum (2001)]]

The text's full title is:

:*Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|Abhisamayālaṅkāranāmaprajñāpāramitopadeśaśāstra}}''
:*Tibetan: Shes rap kyi pha rol tu phyin pa'i man ngag gi bstan bcos mngon par rtogs pa'i rgyan ces bya ba

Which means:

:*''abhisamaya'' (mngon par rtogs pa) - "Realization(s)"
:*''{{IAST|alaṅkāra}}'' (rgyan) -- "Ornament" (Berzin prefers "[[Filigree]]")
:*''nāma'' (zhes bya ba) -- "called"
:*''prajñāpāramitā'' (shes rap kyi pha rol tu phyin ba) - "Perfection of Wisdom"
:*''upadeśa'' (man ngag) -- "Instructions" (literally, "an up-close look")
:*''śāstra'' (bstan bcos)-- "Treatise"

Thus, a "Treatise [of] Instructions [on the] Perfection of Wisdom, called [the] Ornament [of / for] Realization[s]."

Sparham explains:

:"The word ''abhisamaya'' is made up of the prefix ''abhi'' ("toward, over"), the prefix ''sam'' ("together with"), and the root ''i'', a verb of motion with the secondary meaning "to understand." Generally speaking, ''abhisamaya'' means a coming together, a "re-union," particularly of a knower with something to be known, hence a "clear realization." In a title ''abhisamaya'' may just mean "chapter," hence the title ''{{IAST|Abhisamayālaṅkāra}}'' means ''Ornament for the Clear Realizations'' or ''Ornament for the Chapters.'' &lt;ref&gt;Sparham, AA vol 1, pp. xiii-xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Conze adds some details about the term's origins:

:In the [[Pali]] scriptures the term is used to designate the stage when we comprehend the [[Four Noble Truths|four holy truths]]. In the ''[[Abhidharmakosa|Abhidharmakośa]]'' (VI 122) it is interpreted as the correct (''sam'' = ''samyak'') knowledge (''aya'') which is turned toward (''abhi'') [[Nirvana (concept)|Nirv{{IAST|āṅa}}]]. In the ''Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' itself it is invariably coupled with ''prāpti'', "attainment," and in one place...it is a synonymn for ''sāksātkriya'' (realization).&lt;ref&gt;Conze, ''The PP Literature'', pp. 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

As to whether we are speaking of one realization, or of eight, Sparham offers the following explanation by [[Gyaltsab Je|rGyal tshab rJe]], a 14th-15th century Tibetan commentator:

:An admirer views a naturally beautiful woman adorned with golden ornaments reflected in a mirror. The ''Perfection of Wisdom Sūtras'' are the naturally beautiful woman. The systematization of the contents of the ''Sūtras'' into eight subjects and seventy topics are the golden ornaments, and the ''Ornament'' the mirror through which they view her.&lt;ref&gt;Sparham, AA vol 1. p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaborating on the metaphor, Geshe Jampa Gyatso distinguishes between a "natural ornament" (the beautiful woman, the Perfection of Wisdom), "beautifying ornament" (her jewelry, the eight categories and seventy topics), "clarifying ornament" (the mirror, the AA), and "joyful ornament" (the joy of the beholder or AA devotee).&lt;ref&gt;From pp. 3-4 of an oral commentary given in Pomaia, Italy, 1998. Transcript reprinted by the Istituto Lama Tsong Khapa, Pomaia, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical perspective==

The PP Sūtras form the basis for the [[Madhyamika|Mādhyamika]] ("Middle Way") school of Indian [[Buddhist philosophy]], which Tibetan consensus acknowledges as the "highest" (truest, best) tenet system. Other writings by Maitreya and Asa{{IAST|ṅ}}ga, however, form the basis for the rival [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] ("Yoga Adepts") or [[Cittamatra|Cittamātra]] ("Mind Only" or "Consciousness Only") school. It is therefore perhaps understandable that the AA, as Sparham writes, "straddles the ground between Indian Middle Way and Mind Only..." &lt;ref name="Sparham, AA vol. 1, p. xiv"/&gt; Conze concurs, ascribing to the AA "an intermediate position between Mādhyamikas and Yogācārins..." &lt;ref&gt;Conze, ''The PP Literature,'' p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conze discovers in the AA "some affinities with other Yogācārin works" and suggests a number of precise correspondences. At the same time, he notes, "Two of the specific ''doctrines'' of the Yogācārins, i.e. the 'storeconsciousness' and the three kinds of own-being (''svabhāva'') are quite ignored." &lt;ref&gt;Conze, ''The PP Literature,'' pp. 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugène Obermiller]] on the other hand writes that "The main philosophical view expressed in the {{IAST|Abhisamayalaṅkāra}} is that of strictest Monism and of the Non-substantiality and Relativity (''[[sunyata|śūnyatā]]'') of all separate elements of existence, i.e. the standpoint of the Mādhyamikas." Obermiller sees the AA as the product of interaction between Mahāyāna Buddhism and the Hindu [[Vedanta|Vedānta]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;p.Obermiller, ''Analysis of the AA,'' ii-iii. (This is also a main point of his article "The Doctrine of PP...")&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gelugpa]] writers, following [[Buton Rinchen Drub|Bu ston]], affirm Maitreya's text to represent the [[Prasangika|Prāsaṅgika]] viewpoint, but consider Haribhadra and later commentators to have taught something called "Yogācāra [[Svatantrika|Svātantrika]] Madhyamaka."&lt;ref&gt;See Alexander Berzin's "The Five Pathway Minds (The Five Paths): Advanced Presentation," par. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The category is often criticized as artificial, even by the standards of Tibetan [[doxography]]. [[Nyingma]] and [[Sakya]] writers agree that the AA contains [[Madhyamaka]] teachings, without necessarily endorsing the subdivisions proposed by Gelugpas.

In an aside, Ian Charles Harris finds it "curious" that

:"...Maitreya is generally considered to be the mythical instructor of Asa{{IAST|ṅ}}ga, and therefore for those who see ''Māhāyana'' Buddhism in terms of schools [as Harris does not], to be the founder of the ''Yogācāra-Vijñānanavāda.'' One wonders why someone seeking to establish a rival school to Nāgārjuna should wish to write a treatise on the ''Prajñāpāramitā'' if, as many authors believe, it is amenable only to an interpretation from the standpoint of the ''Prāsa{{IAST|ṅgika}}-Madhyamaka''." &lt;ref&gt;''The Continuity of Madhyamaka and Yogācāra in Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism'' (Leiden: Brill, 1991), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris goes on to note the "strange fact" that Tsongkhapa would be a self-avowed Prasangika, despite his system's assignment of  "all the great ''Madhyamaka'' authorities on the ''Prajñāpāramitā''" to Yogācāra Svātantrika Madhyamaka.&lt;ref&gt;''The Continuity of Madhyamaka and Yogācāra in Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism'' (Leiden: Brill, 1991), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Makransky, the AA was designed to impose a Yogācāra framework and vocabulary onto the PP. AA commentator Arya Vimuktisena preserves this Yogācāra reading; however, Makransky sees Haribhadra's reading as an attempt to "Mādhyamika-ize" the AA. Later Tibetan commentators broadly follow Haribhadra.&lt;ref&gt;Makransky, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Eight Categories and Seventy Topics==

The AA is divided into eight categories, which correspond to the eight chapters of the work, and (with one technical exception in chapter eight) &lt;ref&gt;According to Geshe Jampa Gyatso, the eighth ''category'' is the "resultant truth body" whereas the eighth ''clear realization'' is the "resultant exalted wisdom truth body." This reflects a Gelug understanding. From p. 1 of a 1998 oral commentary printed in 2008 and privately circulated by the Istituto Lama Tsong Khapa in Pomaia, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; to the eight "realizations" said to be necessary for full enlightenment. (Conze remarks that these eight are "not attested elsewhere.") &lt;ref&gt;''The Prajnaparamita Literature,'' p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

This division into eight appears thus at the beginning of the AA itself:

:[The Buddhas] proclaim the ''Perfection of Wisdom'' [''Sūtra''] by way of eight subjects. These eight are the knowledge of all aspects, knowledge of paths, and all knowledge. Then there is the awakening to all aspects, when culmination is attained, serial, awakening in an instant, and the Truth Body. [AA verses 1.4 and 1.5, Sparham translation]&lt;ref&gt;Sparham, AA. vol. 1, p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

These eight categories naturally fall into three groups, as shown below. The seventy topics (here enumerated but not shown) are their subdivisions. Obermiller traces this list to a manual attributed to [[Jamyang Shêpa|'Jam dbyangs Bzhad pa]], who also created the various definitions and category-boundaries familiar to Tibetan debaters.&lt;ref&gt;Obermiller, ''Analysis of the AA,'' p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; The text may be subdivided further still, into 1,200 items.

Unless otherwise indicated, the English terms below follow Sparham's translation (which revises Conze's).

===The Three Knowledges===

The first three categories represent the objects or goals of practice, whose attainment leads to peace for the four classes of Buddhist practitioner. Obermiller calls them "the 3 Kinds of Omniscience," while Toh prefers "the Three Exalted Knowers" and Berzin, "the Three Sets of Realized Awareness."

:1. Knowledge of all aspects
::(''Sarvākārajñatā'', rnam pa tham cad mkhen pa).............................'''10 topics'''
::(Wisdom attained by Buddhas; inclusive of categories two and three below)

:2. Knowledge of paths
::(''Mārgākārajñatā'', lam shes pa)....................................................'''11 topics'''
::(Wisdom attained by [[bodhisattva]]s; inclusive of category three below)

:3. All-knowledge
::(''Sarvajñatā'', gzhi shes pa)...........................................................'''9 topics'''
::(Wisdom attained by ''[[sravaka]]s'' and ''[[pratyekabuddha]]s,'' i.e., [[Hinayana]] practitioners)

Berzin explains these categories as

:"...groupings of realizations gained by the three sets of ''aryas'' ('''phags-pa'', highly realized beings), those who have gained nonconceptual cognition of the sixteen aspects of the [[four noble truths]]. The three are organized into basis, pathway, and resultant stages and thus, in a complex manner, are cumulative. They are studied, however, in reverse order to their attainment, in order to inspire interest in developing them."&lt;ref&gt;Berzin, "Overview...," subheading entitled "The Three Sets of Realized Awareness."&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sravakas'' and ''Pratyekabuddhas'', in order to discern the truths of ''[[anitya]]'' (impermanence), ''[[anatman]]'' (selflessness), and ''[[dukha]]'' (suffering), must acquire knowledge of the fundamental constituents of reality (''vastu'')--namely the ''[[skandha]]s'', ''[[ayatana]]s'', and ''[[Skandha#Eighteen Dh.C4.81tus|dhatu]]s'' which are the subjects of [[Abhidharma]]. This is the "all-knowledge" of chapter three. A bodhisattva, in order to benefit all sentient beings, must additionally cognize the various possible paths by which others may progress, so that he may, for example, teach in different ways in accordance with their various situations and capacities. This is the "knowledge of paths" of chapter two. According to the Mahayana understanding, only a fully enlightened Buddha has eliminated obstacles to omniscience (''jneyavaranaheya'') as well as obstacles to liberation (''kleshavaranaheya''). "Knowledge of all aspects" in the first chapter refers to this ultimate state. The AA begins with this as the most impressive of the three, and the ultimate goal of the Mahayana practitioner.

===The Four Practices===

Categories four through seven (in this order) represent progressive stages of spiritual practice en route to enlightenment. Conze calls them four "understandings"; Obermiller, "practical methods"; Toh, "applications"; and Berzin (who notes the close connection to "yoga," ngal sbyor), "applied realizations."

:4. Full awakening to all aspects
::(''Sarvākārābhisambodha'', rnam rzdogs sbyor ba)..........................'''11 topics'''

:5. Culmination clear realization
::(''Murdhābhisamaya'', rtse mor phyin pa'i sbyor ba)..........................'''8 topics'''

:6. Serial clear realization
::(''Anupurvābhisamaya'', mthar gyis pa'i sbyor ba)............................'''13 topics'''

:7. Clear realization in a single instant
::(''Ekaksanābhisamaya'', skad cig ma'i sbyor ba)..............................'''4 topics'''

Referring to the above, Dreyfus explains that

:"...the ''Ornament'' presents the four practices or realizations [chapters 4-7], emphasizing particularly 'the practice of all the aspects' (''rnam rzdogs sbyor ba''), which is treated in the fourth chapter. In fact, that practice is the central topic of the text and may have been an actual practice in which all the aspects of the three wisdoms [chapters 1-3] are brought together... But--and this point is crucial--no teacher I have ever met seems to have practiced this meditation, or even to have been clear on how to do so... Clearly the work's central themes are not practiced in the Tibetan scholastic traditions." &lt;ref&gt;''...Two Hands Clapping'', p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetan tradition lays special emphasis on chapter four, perhaps because it is the longest and most complex, and therefore best suited to commentary and debate. This fourth chapter enumerates, and extensively describes, (in Obermiller's words) "173 forms of the Bodhisattva's ''yoga'' as realizing respectively the 173 aspects (of the 3 forms of Omniscience)."&lt;ref&gt;Obermiller, ''Analysis of the AA,'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Resultant Truth Body===

The last Category concerns the result of spiritual practice:

:8. The Resultant Truth Body
::(''Dharmakāyābhisambodha'', chos sku)........................................'''4 topics'''
:::::::::::::::: --------------
::::::::::::::::'''70 topics'''

By this is meant the [[Dharmakāya]], one of several glorified spiritual bodies (Makransky prefers "embodiments") which a Buddha is said to possess. A commentarial tradition beginning with Arya Vimuktisena interprets the AA as teaching the existence of three such bodies (the ''[[trikaya]]'' doctrine); a rival tradition follows Haribhadra in identifying four such bodies, with the fourth, disputed ''kāya'' being the ''Svabhāvikakāya'' (Tib. ngo bo nyid kyi sku) or "Nature / Essence Body". (Other writers interpret this last term as a synonym for Dharmakaya, or else as symbolizing the unity of the three.) Makransky, whose ''Buddhism Embodied'' focuses on this eighth chapter of the AA, writes that

:"Haribhadra had read ''AA'' 8 as a systematic treatise whose purpose was to present a logically coherent model of Buddhahood. His perspective owed much to Buddhist logic and Abhidharma traditions that had sought such systematic coherence. Ratnākorāśānti, basing himself instead on the perspective on nondual yogic traditions, specifically understood the terms ''svābhāvikakāya'' and ''dharmakāya'' in ''AA'' 8 (and throughout Mahāyana literature) to refer to a Buddha's ''own'' perspective on the nature of his attainment, ''not'' to a human perspective on it. [...] Tsong kha pa, influenced by the logico-epistemological approach expressed in Haribhadra's work, supported his interpretation of ''AA'' 8. [[Gorampa|Go ram pa]], drawing from a perspective framed by nondual yogic praxis, supported Ratnākorāśānti's call to return to Arya Vimuktisena's previous interpretation. Tsong kha pa and Go ram pa's interpretations are closely related to their differing perspectives on a Buddha's awareness, which was an explicit topic of discussion in [[Candrakirti]]'s ''Mādhyamikāvatāra,'' upon which they both commented." &lt;ref&gt;Makransky, pp. 15, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Makransky, the controversy reflects a fundamental tension between immanent and transcendent aspects of Buddhism, which is also reflected in debate over the [[Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma]], or gradual vs. sudden enlightenment (as at [[Samye]]). In his view, all these controversies stem from a fundamental difficulty in reconciling the transcendent nature of Buddhahood with the immanent nature of [[bodhicitta]].

==Ancillary Topics==

Obermiller, describing the curriculum of [[Drepung]]'s (’Bras spungs) [[Go mang]] college, reports that the monks studied the AA in a four-year sequence (after certain preliminary subjects); and that each class also studied a prescribed "secondary subject" (zur-bkol) for that year:

:First class: Introduction to the AA as well as the special topic, the "Twenty Sangha."

:Second class: Finished through the seventh topic of the first AA chapter; the supplementary topic was dependent origination (''pratītyasamutpāda'')

:Third class: Finished the first AA chapter and continued; also studied the Yogacara theory of the storehouse consciousness (''ālāyavijñāna''), and the difference between definitive and interpretable scripture as taught by Mādhyamaka and Yogācāra.

:Fourth class: Focused on the fourth chapter of the AA ("which is regarded as the most difficult"), supplemented with "the teaching about the four degrees of trance in the sphere of Etherial Bodies...and the four degrees of mystic absorption in the Immaterial Sphere." The fourth-year students would conclude with a celebratory feast.

Obermiller adds that "All these studies are conducted in the form of lectures which are accompanied by controversies between the different groups of students according to the method of 'sequence and reason' (''thal-phyir'')." &lt;ref&gt;Obermiller, ''Analysis of the AA,'' p. v-vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty Sangha===
The subject of "Twenty Sangha" (''vimsatiprabhedasamgha,'' dge 'dun nyi shu) aims at schematizing the various spiritual levels through which one might pass on the way to enlightenment. Here "Sangha" refers not so much to actual monks and nuns (the term's most common meaning), but to an idealized, gradated schema of all the types of accomplished Buddhist. The AA explains that it is the latter sense of "Sangha" which constitutes the object of Buddhist [[Refuge (Buddhism)|Refuge]], and in an especially cryptic verse, offers the following subdivision into twenty types:

:There are Twenty [categories]: those with dull and sharp faculties, those who have attained faith and vision, those who are born from family to family, those born with one interval, those who are born in the intermediate state, those who are born, with effort and effortlessly, those who go to Akanistha, three who leap, those who go to the upper limit of the world, those who destroy attachment to the form [realm], those who pacify visual phenomena, the bodily witness, and the rhinoceros. [AA verses 1.23-24, James Apple translation]&lt;ref&gt;Apple, "Twenty Varieties of the Sangha" pt. 1, p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt;

What does this mean? "Akanistha" is the name of the highest Buddha-field in the Form Realm, inhabited by pious gods and tenth-ground bodhisattvas. The solitary nature of the rhinoceros made that animal a traditional symbol for ''pratyekabuddhas'' ("solitary Buddhas"). Beyond that, the list is quite difficult to decipher.

The basic project seems to have been inspired by an [[Four stages of enlightenment|earlier typology of four]] ([[Sotapanna|Stream-Enterer]], [[Sakadagami|Once-Returner]], [[Anagami|Non-Returner]], ''[[Arhat]]''), which may be expanded to eight by distinguishing between approachers to (zhugs pa), or abiders at ('bras gnas), each level. Unfortunately the list of twenty does not correspond very well with this earlier one. Furthermore, Tibetan exegetical tradition estimates the actual number of types of Sangha (including combinations and subdivisions) to approach the tens of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;Apple, ''Stairway to Nirvana,'' p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Such difficulties seem to account for much of the subject's popularity in debate.(See Apple's monograph on the subject.)

===Definitive and Interpretable Scriptures===

Tibetan tradition accepts the common Mahayana view that Sakyamuni Buddha (the historical Buddha) taught various kinds of teachings that do not seem to agree—hence the various discrepancies between [[nikaya]] Buddhism and the Mahayana scriptures—and following the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra]]'', hold that the Buddha taught three grand cycles called "[[Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma|Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma]]." According to the sutra, the first of these consists of Hinayana teachings; the second, of Mahdyamaka teachings; and the third, of Yogacara teachings. The sutra seems to assume the third cycle to consist of the "highest" teachings. However, Tibetan tradition generally sides with Madhyamaka, and therefore must read the sutra in this light.

The issue becomes more pressing in view of the fact that Tibetan Buddhist doctrine in fact combines elements from all three cycles, and is therefore faced with the task of defending its authorities while simultaneously minimizing contradictions between them.

===Form and Formless Realm Absorptions (Trances)===

==Commentarial Literature==

===In India===

The oldest extant commentary is that of [[Arya Vimuktisena|Ārya Vimuktisena]] (Grol sde), called ''Illuminating the Twenty Thousand: A Commentary on the Ornament'' (''Pañcavimsatisāhasrikāprajñāparamitopadesasāstrabhisamāyala{{IAST|ṅ}}kāravrtti,'' nyi khri snang ba). Written in a different style from its successors, it makes frequent reference to [[Vasubandhu]]'s ''[[Abhidharmakosa|Abhidharmakośaśāstra]].''

Even more influential have been the commentaries of [[Haribhadra (Seng-ge Bzang-po)|Haribadra]] (Seng ge Bzang Po), especially his ''Blossomed Meaning'' (''Sphuṭārthā,''  'grel pa don gsal) and ''Light for the Ornament''. (''Abhisamāyala{{IAST|ṅ}}kāralokāprajñāpāramitāvyākhyā'', rgyan snang). Haribhadra also edited an abridgment of this work, called the "Short Commentary" (''Sphuṭārtha'', 'grel pa don gsal/'grel chung).

Altogether, 21 ancient Indian AA commentaries are said to have been translated into Tibetan, although it is possible to doubt the existence of some of the titles listed. For example, an ambiguous reference at the beginning of Haribhadra's prefatory homage is sometimes interpreted to mean that Asanga wrote an AA commentary. If so, the work is no longer extant. Haribhadra also mentions an AA commentary by [[Vasubandhu]] entitled ''Padhati'' ("The Well-Trodden Path"), and one by [[Bhadanta Vimuktisena]] ("the Intelligent" Vimuktisena—not to be confused with Ārya, "the Noble" Vimuktisena) called ''Excellent Explanation of the Twenty Thousand'' (''{{IAST|Abhisamayālaṅkāra-vārttika}}'', tshig le'ur byas pa'i rnam par 'drel pa). However, the commentaries by Ārya Vimuktisena and Haribhadra are most fundamental to the subsequent commentarial tradition. Sparham writes that

:...practically speaking, the ''Light'' [Haribhadra's commentary] is the more readable explanation. It has fewer words to explain [since it is based on the 8,000-line PP rather than the 25,000-line version]. Ārya may well be the more profound thinker, but Hari's is the better book. This perhaps explains why Hari, not Ārya, became the most influential Indian figure in the study of the Perfection of Wisdom in Tibet, even though Ārya is more admired. It also perhaps explains why Hari's own abridgement of his ''Light'' is the basis of nearly every Tibetan Perfection of Wisdom commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Sparham, AA vol. 1, p. xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Makransky, on the other hand, feels that Arya Vimuktasena's commentary better captures the AA's Yogācāra assumptions.

===In Tibet===

The AA was extremely influential in Tibet, resulting in the production of numerous commentaries. The first were those of "Ngok Lotsawa" or "Ngok the Translator" (Rngog Lo tsa ba Bal ldan Shes rab, 1059–1109): ''Mngon rtogs rgyan gyi don bsdus pa'' (a summary), ''Shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa'i man ngag mngon par rtogs pa'i rgyan gi tik chung'' (a "small" commentary), and an 8000-line Prajnaparamita summary called ''Yum brgyad stong pa'i 'grel pa'i don bsdus'' (possibly a sub-commentary to Haribhadra's ''Short Commentary'').

Well known [[Nyingma]] commentaries on the AA include the ''sher phyin mngon rtogs rgyan gyi spyi don'' by [[Patrul Rinpoche|Dza Patrul Rinpoche, Orgyen Jikmé Chökyi Wangpo]] which forms the whole of the sixth volume of his ''Collected Works''; and ''The Words of the Invincible Maitreya'', (''ma pham zhal lung'') by Pöpa Tulku Dongak Tenpé Nyima.

[[Sakya]] commentators on the AA include [[Gorampa|'Go rams pa bsod nams seng ge]] (four commentaries), [[Sakya Chokden]], [[Shes ba Kun rig]] (seven commentaries and treatises),&lt;ref&gt;See David Jackson, Kyoto: 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and G.Yag ston (Sangs gyas dpal, g.yag phrug pa, 1350–1414). The latter's work is ''King of Wish-Fulfilling Jewels''(Mngon rtogs rgyan 'grel pa rin chen bsam 'phel dbang rgyal), in eight volumes.

[[Kagyu]] commentataries on the AA include Padma Karpo's "The Words of Jetsun Maitreya"; the "Short and Clear" commentary  ''mngon  rtogs rgyan gyi ‘grel pa nyung ngu rnam gsal''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = zhwa dmar dkon mchog yan lag| title = mngon rtogs rgyan gyi ‘grel pa nyung ngu rnam gsal | publisher = Vajra Vidhya Institute Library|date = | location =Sarnath | pages = 360| isbn =81-89017-08-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Shamar Konchok Yenlag; "Introducing the Lamp of the Three Worlds: A commentary on the Ornament of Realization" ''(mngon rtogs rgyan rtsa ‘grel gyi sbyor tika ‘jig rten gsum sgron la ‘jugs pa)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = karma phrin-las| title = mngon rtogs rgyan rtsa ‘grel gyi sbyor tika ‘jig rten gsum sgron la ‘jugs pa | publisher = Vajra Vidhya Institute Library|date = | location =Sarnath | pages = 390| isbn =81-89017-04-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Karma Thinleypa

[[Tsongkhapa]]'s teacher Don grub Rin chen encouraged him to study the five texts of Maitreya, especially the AA.&lt;ref&gt;Apple, ''Stairway to Nirvana,'' p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Tsongkhapa's major works, ''Golden Garland'' (gSer-phreng), is an AA commentary. His disciple [[Gyaltsab Je|Gyaltsab]] (rGyal tshab Dar ma Rin chen) also wrote an AA subcommentary, called ''Ornament of the Essence'' (mngon rtongs rgyan gyi grel pa dor gsal rnam bshad snying po'i rgyan).

===In East Asia===

The AA seems not to have been translated into Chinese until the 1930s. At this time the Chinese monk [[Fazun]] (法尊), an associate of [[Taixu]] (太虛), produced a translation entitled 現觀莊嚴論, for use by the Sino-Tibetan Buddhist Institute (漢藏教理院) in [[Sichuan]]. The institute's leaders sought to harmonize the Buddhisms of China and Tibet, and improve relations between the [[Kham]]pas and Han Chinese immigrants to Eastern Tibet. Fazun had studied in the ''geshe'' program of the [[Drepung monastery|Drepung]] ('Bras spungs) college (grwa tshang) of Loseling (Blo gsal gling), near [[Lhasa]], and possibly even obtained the degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chibs.edu.tw/exchange/CONFERENCE/4cicob/fulltext/XIAO-IE-TIAN.htm Chibs.edu.tw] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015101326/http://www.chibs.edu.tw/exchange/CONFERENCE/4cicob/fulltext/XIAO-IE-TIAN.htm |date=October 15, 2006 }} For background on this school, see Gray Tuttle, ''Tibetan Buddhists in the Making of Modern China'' (Columbia UP, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The institute failed to survive the [[Chinese Civil War]].

===In the West===

The AA seems not to have attracted the attention of Western scholars until the 1930s, when [[Eugène Obermiller]] and [[Theodore Stcherbatsky]] produced an edition of the Sanskrit / Tibetan text. Obermiller, a specialist in Yogacara and [[Buddha Nature|Tathagatagarbha]] literature, also wrote a lengthy article on the AA ("The Doctrine of PP...") and was in the process of composing ''Analysis of the AA'' when he died. While Obermiller approached the AA from the perspective of "Monism," which he associated with Vedanta, his studies in the [[Buryat people|Buryat]] Mongolian monastery of Dgah ldan dar rgyas gling (Chilutai) exposed him to a more traditional hermeneutic framework. Along with a translation of the AA (or the three-fifths of it which he finished), he also provided a summary of Haribhadra's commentary for each section.

[[Edward Conze]], who was active from the 1950s to the 1970s, devoted his career to PP translations and commentaries, his AA translation being an early example. An especially significant work was his translation of the PP Sutra in 25,000-lines, which he organized according to the AA topics. This required a certain amount of creative editing on his part—for example, his translation does not strictly follow the 25,000-line AA, but incorporates text from other PP Sutras. Like Obermiller, Conze's writings betray a certain German idealistic influence, hence his references to "Union with the Absolute."

During the 2000s, several Western scholars with experience as Buddhist monks living among the Tibetan exile community in Dharamsala, who had participated in traditional [[geshe]] studies, published articles and books related to the AA. Their ranks included [[Gareth Sparham]] (who translated the AA anew, along with the commentaries of Arya Vimuktisena, Haribhadra, and Tsongkhapa) and Geshe [[Georges Dreyfus]] (whose writings describe the contemporary social context of AA study). In addition, studies and translations by [[Karl Brunnhölzl]] and the [[Padmakara Translation Group]] have focused on non-Gelug readings of this text, which the earlier literature had neglected. The AA has also received attention from several Western [[dharma center]]s (notably those associated with the [[Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition]], whose [[FPMT Masters Program|"Masters Program"]] devotes several years to its study), with the result that the AA has now been transmitted to the West not only as a text, but as a living spiritual tradition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2414">'''Alf Sommerfelt''' (November 23, 1892{{spaced ndash}}October 12, 1965), was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[linguistics|linguist]] and the first professor of [[linguistics]] in Norway, working at the [[University of Oslo]] from 1931 to 1962.

==Personal life==
Sommerfelt was born in [[Trondheim]], Norway.  He married the [[young adult fiction|young adult literature]] writer [[Aimée Sommerfelt]].  He died in Nes, Norway, aged 72.

==Linguistics work==

Sommerfelt was a central figure in the introduction of [[structuralism]] in Norway. He had studied in [[Paris]], and held lectures on [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]], [[glossematics]], the [[Prague school]] and [[American structuralism]]. People at the Nordic institutes, on the other hand, didn't subscribe to Sommerfelt's methods, and there was little contact between them and the structuralists until the 1960s.

Together with the Slavicist [[Olaf Broch]], Sommerfelt founded  the ''Norwegian association for linguistics'' in 1924, an association that would play an important part in the introduction of new linguistic theories to Norway.

Sommerfelt wrote several popular introductions to linguistics. He also wrote an introductory book on general linguistics (1947), a book read by all the linguistics students at the university of Oslo, and reprinted ten years later. Sommerfelt was also one of the editors of ''Norsk riksmålsordbog'' (the Norwegian [[Riksmål]] dictionary).

'''Antoni Lange''' (1863 – 17 March 1929) was a [[Poland|Polish]] poet, philosopher, [[Multilingualism|polyglot]] (15 languages), writer, novelist, science-writer, [[reporter]] and [[translation|translator]]. A representative of Polish [[Parnassianism]] and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], he is also regarded as belonging to the [[Decadent movement]]. He was an expert on  [[Romanticism]], [[French literature]] and a popularizer of Eastern cultures.
His novel ''[[Miranda (novel)|Miranda]]'' is known in some circles.

He translated English, French, [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], Italian, Spanish, Indian, [[American English|American]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], Egyptian and Oriental writers into [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Polish literature|Polish poets]] into French and English. He was also one of the most original poets of the [[Young Poland]] movement. His work is often compared to [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Hutnikiewicz, Młoda Polska, Warszawa 2004, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Marie René Leconte de Lisle]].

Lange was an uncle of the poet [[Bolesław Leśmian]].

==Life==
Lange was born in Warsaw into the patriotic Jewish family of Henryk Lange (1815–1884) and Zofia ''[[née]]'' Eisenbaum (1832–1897).&lt;ref name="mieszczak"/&gt; His father took part in the [[November Uprising]] against the [[Russian Partition]] of Poland. He was an admirerer of [[Romanticism in Poland|Romantic literature]] and its ideals.&lt;ref name="mieszczak"/&gt; Antoni Lange enrolled at [[Warsaw University]] but around 1880 he was expelled for his patriotic activity by the Tsarist [[namiestnik]] Apuchtin who ruled the university at that time.&lt;ref name="mieszczak"/&gt; He supported himself financially as a tutor but also published poetry under the pen-names Napierski and Antoni Wrzesień.&lt;ref name="mieszczak"/&gt; He decided to study in Paris where he encountered new trends in literature, philosophy and art. In France he became familiar with the theories of [[Jean Martin Charcot]], as well as [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]], [[parapsychology]], the philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], oriental religions, European and Eastern literature and modern [[literary criticism]]. He took part in the literary meetings of [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].&lt;ref name="mieszczak"/&gt;

Lange returned to his homeland upon [[Second Polish Republic|Poland's return to independence]],&lt;ref name="mieszczak"/&gt; and became one of the better known members of the Warsaw Society of Writers and Journalists (''Warszawskie Towarzystwo Literatów i Dziennikarzy''), the precursor of the [[Polish Academy of Literature]] founded in 1933.&lt;ref name="mieszczak"/&gt; [[Bolesław Prus]], [[Julian Ochorowicz]] and Lange were the first Polish [[spiritist]]s. He rented an [[apartment]] at [[Nowy Świat Street]] together with [[Władysław Reymont]], a Polish writer and the winner of the Nobel Prize of 1924.&lt;ref name="nobelprize-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1924/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1924.

The main theme of the  poems of this period was the feeling of being isolated and misunderstood by the crowd.

:Your soul was as lonely
:As a barge without an anchor.&lt;ref name="A faithful translation from Poland"&gt;A faithful translation from Poland. {{Attribution needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lange believed that being ''on the road'' is similar to feeling existentional loneliness&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|}

At the beginning of the 20th century he withdrew from public life and became lonely and forgotten. He collected his last poems in notebooks and never allowed anyone to publish them.&lt;ref&gt;The poems were published posthumously in 1931 in the appendix to Lange's play ''[[Malczewski]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Lange's prestige as a writer was undermined by a new generation of [[avant-garde|avant-gardists]]. He died in isolation, destitution and obscurity in [[Warsaw]] in 1929.  He never married and had no children.

Antoni Lange was a friend of [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], [[Jan Kasprowicz]] and [[Stanisław Przybyszewski]].

There are only two portraits of Lange, one of them was painted by [[Stanisław Wyspiański]] in 1890.

==Writing==
[[Image:Władysław Podkowiński, Ulica Nowy Świat w Warszawie w dzień letni.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Władysław Podkowiński]], ''Nowy Świat Street'' (1900), a town where Lange lived]]
Lange was a prolific and versatile writer. He wrote many novels (''[[Miranda (novel)|Miranda]]''), [[short story|short stories]] (''Zbrodnia'', ''Amor i Faun''), dramas (''Malczewski'', ''Wenedzi''), essays and poems. Lange's poetry is contemplative and erudite. It connects the traditions of European culture with [[Buddhism]]. The overriding theme of Lange's [[Existentialism|existential]] concerns was 'extremity' and the 'cycle' of death. In order to form of the poetry Lange connect to contradictory points of [[impressionism]], [[romantism|romantic]] sentimentality and experimentary theories of [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]. Lange was fond of rare poetic forms: [[acrostic]]s, [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactyls]], [[pantoum]]s, [[Prelude (short story)|praeludiums]], [[scherzo]]s, [[canticle]]s and [[triolet]]s. He was also the author of many [[pastoral]]s concerning the  [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] side of village life; [[Philosophy of history|historiosophical]] songs inspired by the philosophy of [[Juliusz Slowacki|Juliusz Słowacki]]; and exotic genesis mythologies from all over the world (from Mexico to Japan).

Lange was also the author of many lyrical essays presenting original views about the relationship between poet and reader concerning [[eschatology|eschatological]] issues (''Thoughts'', ''The Grave'').

In the first phase of his writing he was a lover of esthetism, formal innovation and the theories of Stéphane Mallarmé. However, later he faced to [[primitivism]], anonymity, writings of folk poets and 16th century poets and [[blank verse]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:W 4 wymiarze.JPG|left|thumb|Front cover for Lange's "In the Fourth Dimension" (1912)]] --&gt;
Both Lange and [[Jerzy Żuławski]] are often referred to as "The Pioneers of Polish Science-Fiction". Lange's short stories from the book ''W czwartym wymiarze'' (In the Fourth Dimension, 1912) such as ''Babunia'' (Grandma), ''Rozaura'', ''Lenora'', ''Rebus'' (Puzzle), ''Nowe mieszkanie'' (The New House) and ''Memoriał doktora Czang-Fu-Li'' (Dr. Chang Fu Li's Report) are regarded as early examples of science fiction and [[weird fiction]] in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;However, ''Wojciech Zdarzyński'' by [[Michał Dymitr Krajewski]] published in 1785 is considered the first Polish science-fiction novel.&lt;/ref&gt; The main themes of the stories are: [[hypnosis]], the elixir of youth, eternal love and the [[Materialization (paranormal)|materialization]] of phantoms. On a different note, Dr. Chang Fu Li's eponymous report, "written in Paris in 2652", is concerned with the [[climate change]] brought about by the re-routing of the [[Gulf Stream]] and the subsequent freezing over of Europe, with China taking over as the leading civilization.

Lange's works influenced many poets of the next generation, for example: [[Bolesław Leśmian]], [[Antoni Słonimski]], [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Julian Przyboś]], [[Jan Lechoń]], [[Leopold Staff]]. Paradoxically, most of these poets criticized Lange for his [[anachronism]], eccentricity and ''overintellectualism''.

Lange was also a left wing journalist. He wrote for many important Polish newspapers such as ''Pobudka'', ''Tygodnik Illustrowany'' or ''Przegląd tygodniowy''. He created an original way of [[cultural assimilation]] for Jews via mixed marriage.

Lange's numerous translations of classic 19th century literature from all over the world are still highly regarded. His translations of ''The Golem'' by [[Gustav Meyrink]] and poems by [[Charles Baudelaire]],  [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[George Gordon Byron]] are masterpieces of Polish translation. He also edited many [[anthology|anthologies]] of his own translations of Egyptian, Syrian, Persian, Arabian, Indian and Hebrew poems.

His main sources of inspiration were: the poetry of the [[Three Bards]],; the theories of Stéphane Mallarmé; the writings of [[Charles-Marie-René Leconte de Lisle]]; [[Sanskrit]] [[Indian epic poetry|epics]] of ancient India such as ''[[Mahabharata]]'' or ''[[Savitri (book)|Savitri]]'';  and the poetry of the Polish [[Baroque]] era, especially [[metaphysical poets]] such as [[Mikołaj Sęp Szarzyński]] and [[Józef Baka]] because of their obsession with death.

===''Vita Nova'' and other love poems===
Lange was the author of many love poems influenced by Romanticism, spiritualism and Indian mythology.

{|
|-
|
'''Gdzie ty jesteś, bogini?'''
|
'''Where are you goddess?'''
|-
|
:Gdzie jesteś, czarodziejko, bogini, królewno,
:Życiodawczy, uwodny duchu ty krwiożerny,
:Cudotwórcza, stugłowa, wieczna hydro Lerny,
:Syreno, co mię nęcisz w Scyllę grobów śpiewną?
|
:Where are you sorceress, goddess, queen?
:Life giving, deluding and bloodthirsty phantom.
:Hundred headed thaumaturgus, immortal Hydra of Lerna.
:Siren who calls me to Scylla singing of the graves.&lt;ref name="A faithful translation from Poland"/&gt;
|-
|}

Other love poems by Lange, for example ''Vita Nova'' (A New Life) written in 1898, present an original vision of a decadent and melancholy poet who momentarily becomes an [[Übermensch]] thanks to the illusion of requited love. Unfortunately, there is always a conflict between the vision of ideal love and its realisation. Lange takes also notes the "painful impossibility" of the absolute and eternal union of lovers' souls; he creates a pesimistic vision of the relationship between man and woman, which is always burdened by the certainty that complete fulfilment is impossible.

[[Image:Lady-Lilith.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Lady Lilith'' by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. The symbol of [[Lilith]] was frequently used by Lange]]
In Lange's verses love always makes the subject feel as if he has been ''exiled'' from and ''deprived'' of a latent part of his own existence, but simultaneously he believes that lovers can communicate and feel the same by transmitting their pain and the power of their affection in defiance of metaphorical distance.

===''Deuteronomion'', ''The Hour'', ''Logos'' and ''Sonnets of Veda''===
The most characteristic feature of Lange's writings is the strong influence of Eastern traditions, religions and philosophies such as [[Veda]], [[Brahmin]]ism and [[Buddhism]].

Written in 1887, the cycle of seven [[sonnets]] entitled ''The Sonnets of Veda'' shows the seven stages of human existence&lt;ref&gt;They are: Rupa (the stage of the stone); Jiv-Atma (the stage of the plant); Linga-Sharira (the stage of the stars); Kama-Rupa (Anima bruta); Manas (human spirit); Buddhi (Anima spiritualis); Atma (the Great Soul)&lt;/ref&gt; on its way to [[Nirvana]].

The writing similar to ''Sonnets of Veda'' in order to form is ''Logos''. It is a cycle of ten sonnets which discuss with ten points of view on ''logos'' of history by ten outstanding representatives of [[historiosophy]] of Polish Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;There are: [[Józef Hoene-Wroński]], Józef Gołuchowski, [[Adam Mickiewicz]], Andrzej Towiański, [[Juliusz Słowacki]], [[Zygmunt Krasiński]], Henryk Cieszkowski, Bronisław Ferdynand Trentowski, [[Karol Libelt]], [[Józef Kremer]]&lt;/ref&gt; The poems are strongly influenced by ideas of [[messianism]].
[[File:Fałat Świteź.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''Świteź'' by [[Julian Fałat]]. A lake where Lange wrote many of his poems]]
''The Hour'' written in 1894 was the first prose of Lange, but the short [[symbolism (arts)|symbolic]] novel was published in 1895 in the first volume of ''Poems''. It is a story of [[Artemis]] and [[Aurora (mythology)|Auora]], the two [[ancient]] [[goddess]]es who descends to [[Earth]] to bear witness to problems of human life. In some points ''The Hour'' is similar to the drama ''[[A Dream Play]]'' written by [[August Strindberg]] in 1901 and ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten|The Woman without a Shadow]]'' written by [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]] in 1919. The novel contains many mystical fragments stylized on some kind of [[religious text]]s, [[psalms]], [[manifesto]], the [[greek tragedy]] and the [[ode]]. It also connects prose with elements of poetry and drama.

One of the most representative Lange's writing is ''Deuteronomion'', a mystical [[occult]]ic poem written in Paris in 1902. It is very hermetic and hard to interpret because of its many allusions to the Bible, [[Kabbalah]], [[Sanscrit]] and ancient Slavic legends. The poem tells about a person of a Poet who travels within his soul to hammer out a great initiation of himself and the universe. It is meaningful that ''Deuteronomion'' begins with the ''Epilogue to myself'' and ends with the ''Prologue to the unknown god''.

===Narrative poems===
Lange inaugurated a return to [[narrative poetry]], a form which was unprecedented in Polish literature. This species of poetry was mainly used in Romanticism (for example, by [[George Gordon Byron]] or [[Adam Mickiewicz]]) and in late 19th century went out of use. Therefore, Lange was probably the last and only poet who wrote narrative poems in Poland. There are:
* ''The Oracle'', a poem based on an Indian legend
* ''Ilya Muromets'', a poem inspired by [[bylina]]
* ''The Vision of Catherine of Alexandria''

Lange wrote also ''A Song of Płanetnik'', a narrative poem referred to a character of Płanetnik. Płanetnik is a little [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] ghost from the legends of [[pagan]]s who lived from the earliest historical times to the [[Middle Ages]] on Polish territories. He was a guardian of clouds and a lonely dreamer who predicted the weather. It was supposed that Płanetniks were stray souls of suiciders and victims of murder.  One would call them by sprinkling flour to the wind or fire. ''A Song of Płanetnik'' by Lange tells the story of a young sensitive man who lost contact with reality and set off on a solitary existence.

===Philosophy===
In Lange's cosmogony-philosophy, he announced that evolution of the soul is parallel to evolution of a nation. Capitalism is the enemy of this principle because it acts against individualism, so capitalism is the ideology of the anonymous crowd. If there is no individualism among the people, then there is also not a problem of "bad" versus "good". Then the world comes to disturb its own logic. According to Lange, a world that 'was being born' from ideal space, is still coming to the highest stage of evolution; sometime, it will return to its primary stage. Every step to evolution is a step to the ideal primary. An exception of this "rule of time-line" is the person of genius, who is between the times. In Lange's philosophy he referred to [[Giambattista Vico]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].

Lange was interested in [[spiritualism]] and [[parapsychology]] to contain his own philosophy.

===Critic of Romanticism===
An important part of Lange's writing was the criticism of legacy of [[romanticism]] in modern poetry. In 1924 he founded ''Astrea'', a science-magazine and the first forum about the Polish and European romanticism. Lange rejected romantic [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|illumination]] and brainwave. In his view theological truth is within the reach only of [[erudition]], intellect and afterthought. Lange criticized also the importance of [[individualism]] and the authorial personality. Placing the poem as an artwork at the center, as an ''[[Theory of forms|eidos]]'' of poetry, he affirmed the ''poem's own existence'' and a ''clear idea of creation'', therefore he disagreed with the cult of individualism.

''Bendōwa'' is Dogen's earliest known writing in Japanese.&lt;ref name="kaz"/&gt; Although the text was written in 1231, making it the second piece he wrote following his return from [[China]] to [[Japan]],&lt;ref name="kaz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baroni"&gt;{{cite book| last =Baroni| first =Helen J.| authorlink =| title =The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism| publisher =The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc.| year =2002| location =| pages =20| url =http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42680558&amp;referer=brief_results| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-8239-2240-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was not widely known for hundreds of years until the [[Kanbun (era)|Kanbun Era]] (1661–1673), when it was found in a temple in [[Kyoto]]. In 1684, it was added in [[manuscript]] form by the monk Hangyo Kozen as the first [[fascicle (book)|fascicle]] of the 95-fascicle edition of Dōgen's already well-known master compilation, the ''[[Shōbōgenzō]]''.&lt;ref name=Gudo&gt;{{Citation| last1 =Nishijima|first1=Gudo|last2=Cross|first2=Chodo|authorlink1=Gudo Nishijima|year = 1994| title = Master Dogen's Shōbōgenzō| volume=1|page=1|publisher = Dogen Sangha| isbn=1-4196-3820-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="waddell"&gt;{{cite book| last =Waddell| first =Norman| authorlink =|author2=[[Masao Abe|Abe, Masao]] |author3=[[Dōgen]]| title =The Heart of Dogen's Shobogenzo| publisher =State University of New York Press| year =2002| location =| pages =7–8| url =http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52677753&amp;referer=brief_results| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-585-45679-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This format was standardized in 1788 with its first major printed publication. Despite its four-century absence from the compilation, today it is often said that it "contains within it the essence of all ninety-five fascicles of ''Shōbōgenzō''."&lt;ref name="waddell"/&gt;

==Content==
The essay primarily serves to introduce ''[[zazen]]'' 坐禅,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okumura|first=Shohaku|authorlink=Shohaku Okumura|title=Realizing Genjokoan: The Key to Dogen's Shobogenzo|publisher=[[Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition|Wisdom Publications]]|year=2010|page=9|isbn=9780861716012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or seated meditation, to Japanese Buddhists, very few of whom would have been exposed to the practice. According to [[Gudo Nishijima]], one of the many translators of the text into English, Dōgen often used ''bendō'' to mean the practice of ''zazen'' specifically, despite the fact that ''ben'' (辨) literally means ''pursuit'' and ''dō'' (道) means ''way'' or ''truth''. The title can also thus be interpreted as ''A Talk on the Practice of Zazen''.&lt;ref name=Gudo/&gt; Divided into two sections, the first argues for the preeminence of ''zazen'' before other forms of Buddhist practice, explains the meaning of ''ji juyū zanmai'' 自受用三昧 (or ''ji juyū [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|samādhi]]''), and tells of his travels in [[China]].&lt;ref name="waddell"/&gt;

''Ji juyū zanmai'' can be translated loosely as "''samādhi'' of self-fulfillment and enjoyment" or literally as the "''samādhi'' of receiving and using the self."  [[Kosho Uchiyama]] comments, ". . . we can understand this samādhi of self-fulfillment and enjoyment as the samādhi or concentration on the self when it simply receives and accepts its function, or its spiritual position in the world,"&lt;ref name="uchiyama"&gt;{{cite book| last =Uchiyama| first =Kosho| authorlink =Kosho Uchiyama|author2=[[Dogen]] |author3=[[Shohaku Okumura]] |author4=  Taigen Daniel Leighton | title =The Wholehearted Way: A Translation of Eihei Dogen's Bendowa| publisher =Tuttle Publishing| year =1997| location =| pages =43| url =http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38190728&amp;referer=brief_results| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-8048-3105-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Nishijima writes that it "suggests the state of natural balance which we experience when making effort without an intentional aim."&lt;ref name=Gudo/&gt;

In [[physics]] [[thought experiments]], a '''Boltzmann brain''' is a [[self-awareness|self-aware]] [[sentience|entity]] that arises due to extremely rare random fluctuations out of a state of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. For example, in a homogeneous Newtonian soup, theoretically by sheer chance all the atoms could bounce off and stick to one another in such a way as to assemble a functioning human brain (though this would, on average, take vastly longer than the current lifetime of the universe).

The idea is indirectly named after the Austrian [[physicist]] [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] (1844–1906), who in 1896 published a theory that the Universe is observed to be in a highly improbable non-equilibrium state because only when such states randomly occur can brains exist to be aware of the Universe. One criticism of Boltzmann's "Boltzmann universe" hypothesis is that the most common thermal fluctuations are as close to equilibrium overall as possible; thus, by any reasonable criterion, human brains in a Boltzmann universe with myriad neighboring stars would be vastly outnumbered by "Boltzmann brains" existing alone in an empty universe.

Boltzmann brains gained new relevance around 2002, when some cosmologists started to become concerned that, in many existing theories about the Universe, human brains in the current Universe appear to be vastly outnumbered by Boltzmann brains in the future Universe who, by chance, have exactly the same perceptions that we do; this leads to the absurd conclusion that statistically we ourselves are likely to be Boltzmann brains. Such a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' argument is sometimes used to argue against certain theories of the Universe. When applied to more recent theories about the [[multiverse]], Boltzmann brain arguments are part of the unsolved [[measure problem (cosmology)|measure problem of cosmology]].

==Boltzmann universe==
In 1896, mathematician [[Ernst Zermelo]] advanced an incorrect theory that the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] was absolute rather than statistical.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Stephen Brush|Brush, S. G.]], ''Nebulous Earth: A History of Modern Planetary Physics'' ([[Cambridge]]: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1996), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=vTBZyesS08kC&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 129].&lt;/ref&gt; Zermelo bolstered his theory by pointing out that the [[Poincaré recurrence theorem]] shows statistical entropy in a closed system must eventually be a periodic function; therefore, the Second Law, which is always observed to increase entropy, is unlikely to be statistical. To counter Zermelo's argument, Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] advanced two theories. The first theory, now believed to be the correct one, is that the Universe started for some unknown reason in a low-entropy state. The second and alternative theory, published in 1896 but attributed in 1895 to Boltzmann's assistant [[Ignaz Schütz]], is the "Boltzmann universe" scenario. In this scenario, the Universe spends the vast majority of eternity in a featureless state of [[Heat death of the universe|heat death]]; however, over enough eons, eventually a very rare thermal fluctuation will occur where atoms bounce off each other in exactly such a way that it creates substructures such as our entire observable universe. Boltzmann argues that, while most of the Universe is featureless, we do not see those regions because they are devoid of intelligent life; to Boltzmann, it is unremarkable that we view solely the interior of our Boltzmann universe, as that is the only place where intelligent life lives. (This may be the first use in modern science of the [[anthropic principle]]).&lt;ref name="carroll2017"&gt;[[Sean M. Carroll|Carroll, S. M.]],  [https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00850 "Why Boltzmann brains are bad"] ([[Ithaca, New York]]: [[arXiv]], 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|title=Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415938587|language=en|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, astronomer [[Arthur Eddington]] pointed out that, because a large fluctuation is exponentially less probable than a small fluctuation, observers in Boltzmann universes will be vastly outnumbered by observers in smaller fluctuations. Physicist [[Richard Feynman]] published a similar counterargument within his widely-read 1964 ''[[Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''. By 2004 physicists had pushed Eddington's observation to its logical conclusion: the most numerous observers in an eternity of thermal fluctuations would be minimal "Boltzmann brains" popping up in an otherwise featureless universe.&lt;ref name="carroll2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Albrecht &amp; Sorbo"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Albrecht |first=Andreas |authorlink=Andreas Albrecht (cosmologist) |last2=Sorbo |first2=Lorenzo |date=September 2004 |title=Can the universe afford inflation? |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:hep-th/0405270 |journal=Physical Review D |volume=70 |issue=6 |bibcode=2004PhRvD..70f3528A |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.70.063528 |accessdate=16 December 2014 |arxiv=hep-th/0405270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Given enough time, every possible structure is formed via random fluctuation. Boltzmann-style thought experiments focus on structures like human brains that are presumably self-aware observers. Given any arbitrary criteria for what constitutes a Boltzmann brain (or planet, or universe), smaller structures that minimally and barely meet the criteria are vastly and exponentially more common than larger structures; a rough analogy is how the odds of a real English word showing up when you shake a box of [[Scrabble]] letters are greater than the odds that a whole English sentence or paragraph will form.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The average timescale required for formation of a Boltzmann brain is vastly greater than the current age of the Universe. In modern physics, Boltzmann brains can be formed either by [[quantum fluctuation]], or by a [[thermal fluctuation]] generally involving [[nucleation]].&lt;ref name="carroll2017"/&gt;

===Via quantum fluctuation===
By one calculation, a Boltzmann brain appears as a quantum fluctuation in the vacuum after a time interval of &lt;math&gt;10^{10^{50}}&lt;/math&gt; years. This fluctuation can occur even in a true [[Minkowski space|Minkowski vacuum]] (a flat spacetime vacuum lacking [[vacuum energy]]). Quantum mechanics heavily favors smaller fluctuations that "borrow" the least amount of energy from the vacuum. Typically, a quantum Boltzmann brain will suddenly appear from the vacuum (alongside an equivalent amount of virtual antimatter), remain only long enough to have a single coherent thought or observation, and then disappear into the vacuum as suddenly as it appeared. Such a brain is completely self-contained, and can never radiate energy out to infinity.&lt;ref name="davenport"&gt;Davenport, M., &amp; Olum, K. D. (2010). Are there Boltzmann brains in the vacuum. arXiv preprint arXiv:1008.0808.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Via nucleation===
Current evidence suggests that the observable Universe is not a Minkowski space, but rather a [[de Sitter universe]] with a positive [[cosmological constant]]. In a de Sitter vacuum (but not in a Minkowski vacuum), a Boltzmann brain can form via nucleation of non-virtual particles gradually assembled by chance from the [[Hawking radiation]] emitted from the de Sitter space's bounded [[cosmological horizon]]. One estimate for the average time required until nucleation is around &lt;math&gt;10^{10^{69}}&lt;/math&gt; years.&lt;ref name="davenport"/&gt; A typical nucleated Boltzmann brain will, after it finishes its activity, cool off to absolute zero and eventually completely decay, as any isolated object would in the vacuum of space. Unlike the quantum fluctuation case, the Boltzmann brain will radiate energy out to infinity. In nucleation, the most common fluctuations are as close to thermal equilibrium overall as possible given whatever arbitrary criteria are provided for labeling a fluctuation a "Boltzmann brain".&lt;ref name="carroll2017"/&gt;

Theoretically a Boltzmann brain can also form, albeit again with a tiny probability, at any time during the matter-dominated early universe.&lt;ref name="bousso"&gt;Bousso, R., Freivogel, B., &amp; Yang, I. S. (2008). Boltzmann babies in the proper time measure. Physical Review D, 77(10), 103514.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Boltzmann brain problems==
Many cosmologists believe that if a theory predicts that Boltzmann brains with human-like experiences vastly outnumber normal human brains, then that theory should be rejected or disfavored. Others argue that brains produced via quantum fluctuation, and maybe even brains produced via nucleation in the de Sitter vacuum, don't count as observers. Quantum fluctuations are easier to exclude than nucleated brains, as quantum fluctuations can more easily be targeted by straightforward criteria (such as their lack of interaction with the environment at infinity).&lt;ref name="carroll2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="davenport"/&gt;

Some cosmologists believe that a better understanding of the degrees of freedom in the [[quantum vacuum]] of [[Holographic principle|holographic string theory]] can solve the Boltzmann brain problem.&lt;ref&gt;Garriga, J., &amp; Vilenkin, A. (2009). Holographic multiverse. Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, 2009(01), 021.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In single-Universe scenarios===
In a single de Sitter Universe with a cosmological constant, and starting from any finite spatial slice, the number of "normal" observers is finite and bounded by the heat death of the Universe. If the Universe lasts forever, the number of nucleated Boltzmann brains is, in most models, infinite; cosmologists such as [[Alan Guth]] worry that this would make it seem "infinitely unlikely for us to be normal brains".&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Overbye|first1=Dennis|title=Big Brain Theory: Have Cosmologists Lost Theirs?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/science/15brain.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=26 February 2018|work=The New York Times|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One caveat is that if the Universe is a [[false vacuum]] that locally decays into a Minkowski or a [[big crunch]]-bound [[anti-de Sitter space]] in less than 20 billion years, then infinite Boltzmann nucleation is avoided. (If the average local false vacuum decay rate is over 20 billion years, Boltzmann brain nucleation is still infinite, as the Universe increases in size faster than local vacuum collapses destroy the portions of the Universe within the collapses' future [[light cones]]). Proposed hypothetical mechanisms to destroy the universe within that timeframe range from superheavy [[gravitinos]] to a heavier-than-observed top quark triggering "[[Higgs_boson#Nature_of_the_universe,_and_its_possible_fates|death by Higgs]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death by Higgs rids cosmos of space brain threat|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929333-200-death-by-higgs-rids-cosmos-of-space-brain-threat/|accessdate=26 February 2018|work=New Scientist|date=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boddy, K.

Sinks in the landscape, Boltzmann brains and the cosmological constant problem. Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, 2007(01), 022.&lt;/ref&gt;

If no cosmological constant exists, and if the presently observed [[vacuum energy]] is from [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] that will eventually completely dissipate, then infinite Boltzmann nucleation is also avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Carlip, S.

===In eternal inflation===
{{Further|Measure problem (cosmology)}}

One class of solutions to the Boltzmann brain problem makes use of differing approaches to the measure problem in cosmology: in [[infinity|infinite]] [[multiverse]] theories, the ratio of normal observers to Boltzmann brains depends on how infinite limits are taken. Measures might be chosen to avoid appreciable fractions of Boltzmann brains.&lt;ref name=DeSimoneEtAl2010&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Andrea De Simone|author2=Alan H.

(2007). A paradox in the global description of the multiverse. Journal of High Energy Physics, 2007(06), 018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The measurement problem in cosmology also grapples with the ratio of normal observers to abnormally early observers. In measures such as the [[proper time]] measure that suffer from an extreme "youngness" problem, the typical observer is a "Boltzmann baby" formed by rare fluctuation in an extremely hot, early universe.&lt;ref name="bousso"/&gt;

'''Carlos Vaz Ferreira''' (October 15, 1872 – January 3, 1958) was an Uruguayan philosopher, writer, and academic. Influenced by [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Herbert Spencer]], he is notable for introducing liberal, pluralistic political values and pragmatic philosophical concepts to South American society.

==Life==
Vaz Ferreira was born in [[Montevideo]]. His younger sister was the poet [[María Eugenia Vaz Ferreira]]. His first published work, in 1897, was "Curso expositivo de Psicología elemental" ("Lecture Course on Elemental Psychology"). The same year, he began lecturing in philosophy at the [[University of the Republic, Uruguay|University of the Republic]]. His second work, published in 1898, was a book on [[formal logic]].

In 1903 he was licensed as an attorney. 

In 1905 he published "Ideas y Observaciones" ("Ideas and Observations"), a collection of both new and previously published works. The collection's length led the author to publish it in two separate volumes. 

Vaz Ferreira's most important works were published between 1905 and 1910. In 1907 he published "Problemas de la Libertad" ("Problems of Liberty"), in 1908 "Conocimiento y Acción" ("Knowledge and Action") and "Moral para Intelectuales" ("Morals for Intellectuals"), in 1909 "El Pragmatismo" ("Pragmatism"), and in 1910 "Lógica Viva" ("Living Logic"). 

In 1913 he was named ''maestro de conferencias'' (a position somewhat analogous to associate professor) at the University of the Republic. 

In 1918 he published "Lecciones sobre pedagogía" ("Readings on Pedagogy") and "Sobre la propiedad de la tierra" ("On the Ownership of land"), and in 1922 "Sobre los problemas sociales" ("On Social Problems"). "Sobre el feminismo" ("On Feminism"), one of the earliest treatments of [[feminism]] in Latin American academia, appeared in 1933. "Fermentario" ("Fermentative") appeared in 1938. In 1940 he edited "La actual crisis del mundo" ("The Current World Crisis").

Vaz Ferreira served as vice-chancellor of the University of the Republic between 1928 and 1931 and between 1935 and 1941. In 1931 he was forced to leave the position due to health problems, but was unanimously reelected in 1935. During this period, he was well known for his outspoken defense of academic autonomy against the dictatorship of [[Gabriel Terra]]. 

One of Vaz Ferreira's long-standing academic goals was achieved in 1945 with the foundation of the Faculty of Humanities and Sciences. He served as its dean until 1958.

==Philosophy==
===Influences===
Vaz Fererira's philosophical views were formed under the influence of [[positivism]], which was dominant in Uruguay as well as in Europe during the [[Fin de siècle]] period. He was particularly influenced by the philosophy of [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. 

Vaz Ferreira transcended these early influences, integrating them with the work of other authors he encountered throughout his life, notably [[William James]] and especially [[Henri Bergson]]. Locally, he was to some extent influenced by [[José Enrique Rodó]], although their philosophies are quite divergent.

===Reality, science, and philosophy===

Vaz Ferreira understood reality as something beyond us, but which we may contact in diverse ways. [[Logic]] serves to organize and make it manageable, while [[language]] allows it to be shared. From these elements we construct theories and systems, construct arguments and discourses, etc. Such tools allow us to interact with reality on a practical level, even if they deform and obscure it to a certain extent. 

The disparity between reality – in all its completeness and vastness – and the intellectual tools used to simplify and reduce it into manageable terms led Vaz Ferreira to identify an incompatibility between language and thought when expressing reality. He thus became convinced that "systems" are insufficient to comprehend the world around us. 

Systematization, according to Vaz Ferreira, is a natural and often fruitful tendency of the human spirit. Nevertheless, it often produces [[dogma]]s that conflict with reality. 

He backed up these assertions with concrete examples, using these to reinforce the validity of classifications which, as abstract concepts, can only vainly resolve vague situations. In spite of this, he insisted such classifications could be useful, in the sense of pragmatic rather than abstract utility. 

Vaz Ferreira conceived of language itself as a system of classification in which to speak of something is merely to establish its place in a simplified scheme, and therefore to detach it from the complexity of reality. This detachment allows a distinction to be made between reality and its expression, avoiding ''transcendentalization'', shifting the burden of [[ontology|ontological]] concerns to the linguistic level, where they need not be contemplated.

For Vaz Ferreira, the difference between scientific inquiry and the world is revealed by the attribution to the former of an instrumental character, a distinction that runs against the positivism of the philosopher's formative years. 

Whereas science is instrumental and limited, philosophy is a form of inclusive knowledge that recognizes the shortcomings of systematic thought; philosophy is that which establishes the limitations as well as the boldness of the sciences, and it is the role of philosophy to integrate all human knowledge. 

The philosophical understanding of science corresponds not to a formal scheme but to a gradual process, in which the objects of scientific inquiry are assessed independently and inclusively. Philosophy thus parallels science in order to comprehend it. Vaz Ferreira used the sea as a metaphor for understanding and abstraction: as depth increases, there is less clarity. This deepening leads to a loss of precision, according to which science, although a form of knowledge that is distributed and shared, establishes itself as an imperious necessity, the same as philosophy. In this respect, philosophy and science exist in a fraternal relationship, not as discontinuous disciplines, but as components of the same phenomenon. 

Vaz Ferreira recognized both good and bad forms of positivism, and saw similar dualities within skepticism and pragmatism. While bad positivism imposes scientific limitations on human understanding, good positivism encourages a love of science, which imparts numerous benefits, including to philosophy. Whereas bad skepticism presumes the impossibility of understanding, good skepticism encourages a healthy distrust of language and systematization. While bad pragmatism subjugates belief entirely to one's own will, good pragmatism regulates belief by acknowledging one's ignorance.

===Living Logic or Psycho-Logic===

&lt;!-- [[File:Ferreira-Einstein-photo.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Photo of [[Albert Einstein]] discussing with '''Carlos Vaz Ferreira'' in 1925 in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay.]] Deleted from commons December 1, 2012--&gt;

One of Vaz Ferreira's fundamental concepts is ''Living Logic'' (''Lógica Viva'') or ''Psycho-Logic'' (''Psico-Lógica''), which he began to develop after completing "The Problems of Liberty". The central idea of Living Logic is to uncover the way in which language and schematization not only depart from reality, but many times encounter problems that do not exist. 

In Living Logic, one can detect the logicism of Stuart Mill on the one hand and the psychologicism of Bergson and William James on the other. The latter was a major feature of the [[spiritualism|spiritualist]] and [[idealism|idealist]] intellectual climate that predominated in Uruguay during the 1900s. 

This exhibition of errors, fallacies, and paralogisms forms the basis of a new mode of thought, more comprehensive than the traditional variety, based on the living, concrete phenomena on which schemes are formulated. 

Hence, ''Living Logic'' comprises an ''Ethic of Understanding'', with implications relating to [[metaphysics]], the [[philosophy of religion]], and [[morality]].

===Morality===

Vaz Ferreira conceived of morality as an intent to delineate reality according to the categories imposed by schemes and language, combined with the rejection of systematic and dogmatic solutions. On the contrary, he advocated a morality that acknowledged the unique problems of each person and place, and sought to solve them accordingly. 

This morality, which emphasizes nothing as much as experience, attributes to metaphysics the role not of theories and definitions, but suggestions and a vision of immense possibilities.

Ideals, for Vaz Ferreira, interfere with practicality, since they admit choices which many times require needless sacrifices, both for oneself and for others. Conflict leads to conflict, and this culture of struggle gives rise to a conflictual morality that permeates and plagues the history of mankind.

===Religion===
Carlos Vaz Ferreira was a freethinking agnostic, like many cultured Uruguayans of the period. Although he often criticized [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] religious institutions, he was not particularly critical of religious sentiment in itself, which he considered an open and expectant spiritual attitude in the face of the transcendent unknown. Vaz Ferreira understood religiosity as a field of metaphysical questions and doubts which, through sincerity and open-mindedness, can be met as they truly are.

In philosophy, the '''Cartesian Self''', part of a [[thought experiment]], is an individual's mind, separate from the body and the outside world, thinking about itself and its existence. It is distinguished from the [[Cartesian Other]], anything other than the Cartesian self. According to the philosopher [[Descartes]], there is a divide intrinsic to [[consciousness]], such that one cannot ever bridge the space between one's own consciousness and that of another.

Descartes concluded famously that [[Cogito ergo sum]], "I think, therefore I am", but realized that according to his [[wax argument]] you could never similarly demonstrate the existence of the 'other'.  However, the Cartesian Self, he concluded, is thus almost entirely [[Self-evidence|self-evident]]: the existence of some being ''asking'' about itself necessarily implied that such a being existed.  Because of this, while humans can know everything of the self and its mysteries, we cannot actually know anything of anything that is not the self.

It is based on the whole of the Cartesian Pure Inquirer, where cognitive capabilities and methods of achieving knowledge are alike to all knowers. However, the "knower" (particularly to Descartes) is treated as a featureless abstract, and not an actual person.

The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] teaches that [[God]] is All-Perfect; this infinite Perfection is viewed, successively, under various aspects, each of which is treated as a separate perfection and characteristic inherent to the Divine Substance, or Essence. A certain group of these, of paramount import, is called the [[Attributes of God in Christianity|Divine Attributes]].

The position of the Catholic Church declared in the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), is again clearly stated in the following pronouncement of the Vatican Council:
:''"The Holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church believes and professes that there is one living and true God, Creator and Lord of heaven and earth, omnipotent, eternal, immense, incomprehensible, infinite in intellect and will and in all perfection Who, being One, singular, absolutely simple and unchangeable spiritual substance, is to be regarded as distinct really and in essence from the world most blessed in and from Himself, and unspeakably elevated above all things that exist, or can be conceived, except Himself."''

==Knowledge of God==
[[Thomas Aquinas]] said that starting from movement, becoming, contingency, and the world's order and beauty, one can come to a knowledge of God as the origin and the end of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608b.htm Toner, Patrick. "The Existence of God." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 16 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Church teaches that God can be known with certainty from the created world with human reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c1.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', §36]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Our natural knowledge of God is acquired by discursive reasoning upon the data of sense by introspection, ''"For the invisible things of Him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; His eternal power also, and Divinity"'' (St. Paul, {{Bibleverse|Romans|1:20}}). Created things, by the properties and activities of their natures, manifest, as in a glass, darkly, the powers and perfections of the creator. But these refracted images of Him in finite things cannot furnish grounds for any adequate idea of the Infinite Being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02062e.htm Fox, James. "Divine Attributes." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 16 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Since our knowledge of God is limited, our language about him is equally so. We can name God only by taking creatures as our starting point,...Our human words always fall short of the mystery of God."{{sfn|CCC §§40, 42}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of his own accord and by his own power he made all things and arranged and perfected them; and his will is the substance of all things. He alone, then, is found to be God; he alone is omnipotent, who made all things; he alone is Father, who founded and formed all things, visible and invisible, sensible and insensate, heavenly and earthly, by the Word of his power. And he has fitted and arranged all things by his wisdom; and while he comprehends all, he can be comprehended by none. He is himself the designer, himself the builder, himself the inventor, himself the maker, himself the Lord of all.([[Irenaeus]]. ''Against Heresies'', 2:30:9)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Revelation==
"By natural reason man can know God with certainty, on the basis of his works. But there is another order of knowledge, which man cannot possibly arrive at by his own powers: the order of divine Revelation. Through an utterly free decision, God has revealed himself and given himself to man..."{{sfn|CCC §50}} By revealing himself God wishes to make man capable of responding to him, and of knowing him and of loving him far beyond their own natural capacity. God communicates himself to man gradually.{{sfn|CCC §§52, 53}}

According to ''Dei verbum'', the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation, God reveals himself through his Word;
* in Creation: "God, who through the Word creates all things (see John 1:3) and keeps them in existence, gives men an enduring witness to Himself in created realities (see Rom. 1:19-20)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html [[Pope Paul VI]], ''Dei Verbum'', §3, November 18, 1965]&lt;/ref&gt;
* in Sacred Scripture: "Those divinely revealed realities which are contained and presented in Sacred Scripture have been committed to writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit."{{sfn|''Dei Verbum'', §11}}
* through Jesus Christ: "Jesus perfected revelation by fulfilling it through his whole work of making Himself present and manifesting Himself: through His words and deeds, His signs and wonders, but especially through His death and glorious resurrection from the dead and final sending of the Spirit of truth."{{sfn|''Dei Verbum'', §4}}      

==Way of eminence==
The concept of a perfection derived from created things and freed of all defects, is, in its application to God, expanded without limit. God not only possesses every excellence discoverable in creation, but He also possesses it infinitely. To emphasize the transcendence of the Divine perfection, in some cases an abstract noun is substituted for the corresponding adjective; as, God is Intelligence; or, again, some word of intensive, or exclusive, force is joined to the attribute; as, God alone is good, God is goodness itself, God is all-powerful, or supremely powerful.

Transcendentally one, absolutely free from composition, the Divine Being is not, and may not be conceived as, a fundamental substrate in which qualities or any other modal indeterminations inhere. The reality to which the various attributes are ascribed is one and indivisible.

==Essence and attributes==
In this respect, the relation of the attributes to the Divine nature might be illustrated by the various reflections of one and the same object from a concave, a convex, and a plane mirror. Nevertheless, to systematize the idea of God, and to draw out the rich content of the knowledge resulting from the proofs of God's existence, some primary attribute may he chosen is representing one aspect of the Divine perfection from which the others may be rigorously deduced. Then arises a logical scheme in which the derivative attributes, or perfections stand towards one another in a relation somewhat similar to that of the essence and the various properties and qualities in a material substance. In this arrangement the primary perfection is termed the metaphysical essence, the others are called attributes. The essence, too, may be regarded as that characteristic which, above all others, distinguishes the Deity from everything else. Upon the question, which attribute is to be considered primary, opinions differ. Many eminent theologians favour the conception of pure actuality (''[[Actus Purus]]''), from which simplicity and infinity are directly deduced. Most modern authors fix on aseity (Aseitas; a = "from" se = "himself"), or self-existence; for the reason that, while all other existences are derived from, and depend on, God, He possesses in Himself, absolutely and independently, the entire reason of His uncaused infinite Being. In this, the most profound and comprehensive distinction between the Divinity and everything else, all other distinctions are implicitly expressed. Whether, and in what way, the distinctions between the attributes and the metaphysical essence, and among the attributes themselves have an [[ontological]] basis in the Divine nature itself was subject, which divided Nominalists and Realists, Thomists and Scotists, in the age of Scholasticism (cf. Vacant, Dict. de théol. cathol., I, 2230–34).

Throughout the writings of the Fathers the spirituality of the Divine Nature, as well as the inadequacy of human thought to comprehend the greatness, goodness, and infinite perfection of God, is continually emphasized. At the same time, Catholic philosophy and theology set forth the idea of God by means of concepts derived chiefly from the knowledge of our own faculties, and our mental and moral characteristics. We reach our philosophic knowledge of God by inference from the nature of various forms of existence, our own included, that we perceive in the Universe. All created excellence, however, falls infinitely short of the Divine perfections, consequently our idea of God can never truly represent Him as He is, and, because He is infinite while our minds are finite, the resemblance between our thought and its infinite object must always be faint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01558c.htm Fox, James. "Anthropomorphism, Anthropomorphites." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 16 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes men are led by a natural tendency to think and speak of God as if He were a magnified creature — more especially a magnified man — and this is known as anthropomorphism. Thus God is said to see or hear, as if He had physical organs, or to be angry or sorry, as if subject to human passions: and this is a perfectly legitimate and more or less unavoidable use of metaphor.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06612a.htm Toner, Patrick. "The Nature and Attributes of God." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 16 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presence==
"Presence of God" is a term used in [[Catholic]] theology and devotion.

In [[theology]], it refers to the belief that God is present by His Essence everywhere and in all things by reason of His Immensity. Psalm 139:7-8 reads:&lt;poem&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Where can I go from your Spirit?&lt;br&gt; Where can I flee from your presence?&lt;br&gt; If I go up to the heavens, you are there;&lt;br&gt;if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also refers to the belief that God is in a special manner really and substantially present in the souls of the just.&lt;ref name=devine&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12396a.htm Devine, Arthur. "Presence of God." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 23 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Catholic devotions|devotion]], to put oneself in the presence of God, or to live in the presence of God, as spiritual writers express it, means to become actually conscious of God as present, or at least so to live as though thus actually conscious.&lt;ref name=devine/&gt; 

Another way to be mindful of His Presence is by the exercise of reason directed by faith. One sees God in the earth, the sea, the air and in all things; in heaven where He manifests His Glory, in hell where He carries out the law of His Justice.&lt;ref name=devine/&gt;

A writer particularly associated with this devotion is [[Brother Lawrence]], the author of ''[[The Practice of the Presence of God]]''.

==Division of attributes==
Taking as the basis of classification the ways by which the attributes are developed, they are divided into positive and negative. Among the negative attributes are simplicity, infinity, immutability. The chief positive attributes are unity, truth, goodness, beauty, omnipotence omnipresence, intellect and will, personality. Some authors divide them into incommunicable and communicable. The former class comprises those that belong to God alone (e.g., all-wise, self-existent, omnipotent) to the latter belong those that are predicable, analogically, of God and creatures as good, just, intelligent. Again, the divine nature considered either as static or as the source activity; hence another division into quiescent and active. Finally, some perfections involve a relation to things distinct from God, while others do not; and from this standpoint theologians divide the attributes into absolute and relative. The various classifications adopted by modern Protestant theologians are due partly to the results of philosophical speculation and partly to new conceptions of the nature of religion. Schleiermacher, e.g. derives the attributes of God from our threefold consciousness of absolute dependence, of sin, and of grace. Others, with Lipsius, distinguish the metaphysical attributes from the psychological and the ethical. A simpler division groups omnipotence, omnipresence, eternity, omniscience, and unity as the metaphysical predicates, justice and goodness as the moral attributes. The fundamental attribute is, according to Ritschl, love; according to Professor Royce, omniscience. The main difficulty with these writers centres about the idea of God as a personal being.

==Historical development==
In the fourth century Aetius and Eunomius maintained that, because the Divine nature is simple, excluding all composition or multiplicity, the various terms and names applied to God are to be considered synonymous. Otherwise they would erroneously imply composition in God. This opinion was combated by St. Cyril of Alexandria, St. Basil, and St. Gregory of Nyssa (In Eunom., P. G., XLV). The principle of attribution received more precise statement at the hands of St. Augustine, in his investigation of the conditions of intellectual knowledge (De Genesi ad Litteram, IV, 32). In the ninth century, John Scotus Erigena, who was largely influenced by Neo-Platonism, transmitted through the works of the Pseudo-Dionysius, contributed to bring into clearer relief the analogical character of predication (De Divinâ Naturâ, Lib. I). The Nominalists revived the views of Eunomius, and the opposition of the Realists was carried to the other extreme by Gilbert de la Porrée, who maintained a real, ontological distinction between the Divine Essence and the attributes. His opinion was condemned by the Council of Reims (1148). St. Thomas definitively expressed the doctrine that, after some controversies between Scotists and Thomists upon minor points and subtleties, and with some divergence of opinion upon unimportant details, is now the common teaching of Catholic theologians and philosophers. It may be summarized as follows: The idea of God is derived from our knowledge of finite beings. When a term is predicated of the finite and of the Infinite, it is used, not in a univocal, but in analogical sense. The Divine Perfection, one and invisible, is, in its infinity, the transcendental analogue of all actual and possible finite perfections. By means of an accumulation of analogous predicates methodically co-ordinated, we endeavour to form an approximate conception of the Deity who, because He is Infinite, cannot be comprehended by finite intelligence. Modern philosophy presents a remarkable gradation, from Pantheism, which finds God in everything, to Agnosticism, which declares that He is beyond the reach of knowledge. Spinoza conceives God as "a substance consisting of infinite attributes each of which expresses eternal and infinite essence". The two attributes manifested to us are thought and extension. At the other extreme we find Agnostics of the school of Herbert Spencer (see [[agnosticism]]) and some followers of Hegel, who hold that the nature of God, or, to use their favourite term, "the Absolute" is utterly unknowable, and its existence not determined to any mode; therefore, to predicate of it various attributes, expressive of determinations, is idle and misleading. Between the finite and the Infinite there is no common ground of predication. Hence, words that signify finite perfections can have no real meaning when predicated of God. They become mere empty symbols. All theological attempts to elaborate an idea of God are vain, and result in complete absurdity when they conceive God after man's image and likeness (see [[anthropomorphism]]), and circumscribe the Infinite in terms borrowed from human psychology. Criticism of this kind indicates that its authors have never taken the trouble to understand the nature of analogical predication, or to consider fairly the rigorous logical process of refining to which terms are subjected before being predicated of God. It often happens too, that writers, after indulging liberally in eloquent denunciation of theological anthropomorphism proceed, on the next page, to apply to the Infinite, presumably in a strictly univocal sense, terms such as "energy", "force", and "law", which are no less anthropomorphic, in an ultimate analysis, than "will" and "intelligence".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9629">'''Damascius''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|m|æ|ʃ|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Δαμάσκιος}}, {{circa}} 458 &amp;ndash; after 538), known as "the last of the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]]," was the last [[scholarch]] of the [[Platonic Academy#Neoplatonic Academy|School of Athens]]. He was one of the [[pagan]] philosophers persecuted by Emperor [[Justinian I]] in the early 6th century AD, and was forced for a time to seek refuge in the [[Sassanid empire|Persian]] court, before being allowed back into the [[Byzantine empire|Empire]]. His surviving works consist of three commentaries on the works of [[Plato]], and a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] text entitled ''Difficulties and Solutions of First Principles''.

==Life==
Damascius was born in [[Damascus]] in [[Roman Syria|Syria]], whence he derived his name: his Syrian name is unknown. In his early youth he went to [[Alexandria]], where he spent twelve years partly as a pupil of Theon, a rhetorician, and partly as a professor of [[rhetoric]]. He was then convinced by his teacher Isidore to shift his focus to [[philosophy]] and science, and studied under [[Hermias (philosopher)|Hermias]] and his sons, [[Ammonius Hermiae|Ammonius]] and [[Heliodorus of Alexandria|Heliodorus]]. Later on in life he migrated to [[Athens]] and continued his studies under [[Marinus of Neapolis|Marinus]], the mathematician, [[Zenodotus (philosopher)|Zenodotus]], and [[Isidore of Alexandria|Isidore]], the dialectician. He became a close friend of Isidore, succeeded him as head of the [[Platonic Academy#Neoplatonic Academy|School of Athens]] in ca. 515, and wrote his biography, part of which is preserved in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]'' of [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Damascius |volume=7 |pages=783-784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 529, [[Justinian I]] closed the school, and Damascius with six of his colleagues sought an asylum, probably in 532, at the court of [[Khosrau I of Persia]]. They found the conditions intolerable, and when the following year Justinian and Khosrau concluded a peace treaty, it was provided that the philosophers should be allowed to return.&lt;ref&gt;Agathias, ''Scholast.'' ii. 30&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Damascius returned to Alexandria and there devoted himself to the writing of his works.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Among the disciples of Damascius the most important are [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], the celebrated commentator on [[Aristotle]], Epictetus, and [[Eulamius]]. He dedicated his ''Life of Isidore'' to his disciple [[Theodora of Emesa|Theodora]]. We have no further particulars of the life of Damascius; we only know that he did not found any new school, and thus Neoplatonist philosophy ended its external existence. But Neoplatonist ideas were preserved in the Christian church down to the later times of the Middle Ages, notably by means of the tremendous influence exerted by the [[Pseudo-Dionysius|Pseudo-Dionysian corpus]]. Mazzucchi (2006) identifies Damascius himself as the author of the Pseudo-Dionysian writings, the "last counter-offensive of the pagan" (''l'ultima controffensiva del paganesimo'').

==Writings==
His chief treatise is entitled ''Difficulties and Solutions of First Principles'' ({{lang|grc|ἀπορίαι καὶ λύσεις περὶ τῶν πρώτων ἀρχῶν}}). It examines the nature and attributes of [[God]] and the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]. This examination is, in two respects, in striking contrast to that of certain other Neoplatonist writers. It is conspicuously free from Oriental [[mysticism]], and it contains no polemic against [[Christianity]], to the doctrines of which, in fact, there is no allusion. Hence the charge of impiety which [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] brings against him. In this treatise Damascius inquires into the first principle of all things, which he finds to be an unfathomable and unspeakable divine depth, being all in one, but undivided. His main result is that God is infinite, and as such, incomprehensible; that his attributes of goodness, knowledge and power are credited to him only by inference from their effects; that this inference is logically valid and sufficient for human thought. He insists throughout on the unity and the indivisibility of God.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; This work is, moreover, of great importance for the history of philosophy, because of the great number of accounts which it contains concerning former philosophers.

The rest of Damascius's writings are for the most part commentaries on works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. The surviving commentaries are: 
*Commentary on Plato's ''Parmenides''.
*Commentary on Plato's ''Phaedo''. This work has been erroneously ascribed to [[Olympiodorus the Younger|Olympiodorus of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="reale1"&gt;Giovanni Reale, John R. Catan, 1989, ''A History of Ancient Philosophy: The Schools of the Imperial Age'', page 546. SUNY Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Commentary on Plato's ''Philebus''. Also erroneously ascribed to Olympiodorus.&lt;ref name="reale1"/&gt;

Among the lost works there were:
*Commentaries on Plato's ''Timaeus'', ''First Alcibiades'', and other dialogues.
*Commentaries on Aristotle's ''De Coelo'', and other works. The writings of Damascius on Time, Space, and Number, cited by [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] in his commentary on Aristotle's ''Physica'',&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, fol. 189, b., 153, a., 183, b.&lt;/ref&gt; are perhaps parts of his commentaries on Aristotle's writings.
*''Life of Isidore.''  Damascius's biography of his teacher [[Isidore of Alexandria|Isidore]] (perhaps a part of the ''philosophos historia'' attributed to Damascius by the [[Suda]]), of which [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]&lt;ref&gt;Photius, Cod. 242, comp. 181; in volume 6 of the edition by Rene Henry.&lt;/ref&gt; has preserved a considerable fragment.  The text has been reconstructed and translated recently.&lt;ref&gt;Polymnia Athanassiadi (ed.), Damascius. The Philosophical History.   Athens:  Apamea Cultural Association, 1999.  Pp. 403.  {{ISBN|960-85325-2-3}}.[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2000/2000-01-23.html BMCR review]&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered the source containing most details about the life of [[Ammonius Hermiae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ammonius|title=Ammonius|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Logoi Paradoxoi'', in 4 books, of which [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]&lt;ref&gt;Photius, Cod. 130&lt;/ref&gt; also gives an account and specifies the respective titles of the books.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10837">'''Difference''' is a key [[concept]] of [[philosophy]], denoting the process or set of [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] by which one [[entity]] is distinguished from another within a [[Relational theory|relational]] field or a given [[conceptual system]]. In the [[Western philosophy|Western philosophical system]], difference is traditionally viewed as being opposed to [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]], following the [[Gottfried Leibniz#The Principles|Principles of Leibniz]], and in particular, his Law of the [[identity of indiscernibles]]. In [[structuralism|structuralist]] and [[poststructuralism|poststructuralist]] accounts, however, difference is understood to be ''constitutive'' of both meaning and identity. In other words, because identity (particularly, [[personal identity]]) is viewed in [[non-essentialism|non-essentialist]] terms as a construct, and because constructs only produce meaning through the interplay of differences (see below), it is the case that for both [[structuralism]] and [[poststructuralism]], identity cannot be said to exist without difference.

==Difference in Leibniz's law==
[[Gottfried Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz's]] Principle of the [[identity of indiscernibles]] states that two things are identical if and only if they share the same and only the same properties. This is a principle which defines identity rather than difference, although it established the tradition in [[logic]] and [[analytical philosophy]] of conceiving of identity and difference as oppositional.

==Kant's critique==
In his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', [[Immanuel Kant]] argues that it is necessary to distinguish between the thing in itself and its appearance. Even if two objects have completely the same properties, if they are at two different places at the same time, they are numerically different:
{{Quote|''Identity and Difference''.— [...] Thus, in the case of two drops of water, we may make complete abstraction of all internal difference (quality and quantity), and, the fact that they are intuited at the same time in different places, is sufficient to justify us in holding them to be numerically different. {{sic|[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibnitz]]}} regarded phaenomena as things in themselves, consequently as {{lang|la|intelligibilia}}, that is, objects of pure understanding [...], and in this case his principle of the indiscernible ({{lang|la|principium identatis indiscernibilium}}) is not to be impugned. But, as phaenomena are objects of sensibility, and, as the understanding, in respect of them, must be employed empirically and not purely or transcendentally, plurality and numerical difference are given by space itself as the condition of external phaenomena. For one part of space, although it may be perfectly similar and equal to another part, is still without it, and for this reason alone is different from the latter [...]. It follows that this must hold good of all things that are in the different parts of space at the same time, however similar and equal one may be to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|title=Critique of Pure Reason|origyear=1781|year=1855|others=Trans. by [[J. M. D. Meiklejohn]]|publisher=Henry G. Bohn|location=London|page=191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E74IAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA191}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Difference in structuralism ==
[[Structural linguistics]], and subsequently [[structuralism]] proper, are founded on the idea that meaning can only be produced differentially in signifying systems (such as language). This concept first came to prominence in the [[structuralism|structuralist]] writings of Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and was developed for the analysis of social and mental structures by French [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]].

The former was concerned to question the prevailing view of meaning "inhering" in words, or the idea that language is a [[nomenclature]] bearing a one-to-one correspondence to the real. Instead, Saussure argues that meaning arises through differentiation of one [[sign]] from another, or even of one [[phoneme]] from another:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In language there are only differences. Even more important: a difference generally implies positive terms between which the difference is set up; but in language there are only differences without positive terms. Whether we take the signified or the signifier, language has neither ideas nor sounds that existed before the linguistic system, but only conceptual and phonic differences that have issued from the system. The idea or phonic substance that a sign contains is of less importance than the other signs that surround it. [...] A linguistic system is a series of differences of sound combined with a series of differences of ideas; but the pairing of a certain number of acoustical signs with as many cuts made from the mass thought engenders a system of values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saussure|first=Ferdinand de|title=Course in General Linguistics|origyear=1916 |year=1959|publisher=New York Philosophical Library|location=New York|pages=121–22|url=http://faculty.smu.edu/dfoster/cf3324/saussure.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his ''[[Structural Anthropology]]'', [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] applied this concept to the anthropological study of mental structures, [[kinship]] and [[belief systems]], examining the way in which social meaning emerges through a series of structural oppositions between paired/opposed kinship groups, for example, or between basic oppositional categories (such as friend and enemy, life and death, or in a later volume, [[The Raw and the Cooked|the raw and the cooked]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lévi-Strauss|first=Claude|title=Structural Anthropology|origyear=1958 |year=1963|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lévi-Strauss|first=Claude|title=The Raw and the Cooked|origyear=1964 |year=1970|publisher=Cape|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference and {{lang|fr|différance}} in poststructuralism&lt;!--'Difference (poststructuralism)' redirects here; linked from 'Template:Deleuze-Guattari'--&gt;==
{{also|Alterity}}
The French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] both extended and profoundly critiqued structuralist thought on the processes by which meaning is produced through the interplay of difference in language, and in particular, writing. Whereas structuralist linguistics had recognized that meaning is differential, much structuralist thought, such as [[narratology]], had become too focused on identifying and producing a typology of the fixed differential structures and [[binary oppositions]] at work in any given system. In his work, Derrida sought to show how the differences on which any signifying system depends are not fixed, but get caught up and entangled with each other. Writing itself becomes the prototype of this process of entanglement, and in ''[[Of Grammatology]]'' (1967) and "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}" (in ''Margins of Philosophy'', 1972) Derrida shows how the concept of writing (as the paradoxical absence or de-presencing of the living voice) has been subordinated to the desired "full presence" of speech within the Western philosophical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|title=Of Grammatology|origyear=1967 |year=1976|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Margins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|title=Margins of Philosophy|origyear=1972 |year=1982|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=3–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early thought on the relationship between writing and difference is collected in his book of essays entitled ''[[Writing and Difference]]'' (1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|title=Writing and Difference|origyear=1967 |year=1978|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, Derrida coined the term {{lang|fr|[[différance]]}} (a deliberate misspelling of {{lang|fr|différence}}) in order to provide a conceptual hook for his thinking on the meaning processes at work within writing/language.&lt;ref name="Margins"/&gt; This [[neologism]] is a play on the two meanings of the French word {{lang|fr|différer}}: to differ and to defer. Derrida thereby argues that meaning does not arise out of fixed differences between static elements in a structure, but that the meanings produced in language and other signifying systems are always partial, provisional and infinitely deferred along a chain of differing/deferring [[Sign (semiotics)|signifiers]]. At the same time, the word {{lang|fr|différance}} itself ''performs'' this entanglement and confusion of differential meanings, for it depends on a minimal difference (the substitution of the letter "a" for the letter "e") which cannot be apprehended in oral speech, since the suffixes "-ance" and "-ence" have the same pronunciation in French. The "[[phonemic]]" (non-)difference between {{lang|fr|différence}} and {{lang|fr|différance}} can only be observed in writing, hence producing differential meaning only in a partial, deferred and entangled manner.

{{lang|fr|Différance}} has been defined as "the non-originary, constituting-disruption of presence": spatially, it differs, creating spaces, ruptures, and differences and temporally, it defers, delaying presence from ever being fully attained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/diff-ont/ "Differential Ontology"] at the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida's criticism of [[essentialist]] [[ontology]] draws on the differential ontology of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (who introduced the concept of {{lang|de|Verschiedenheit}}, "difference", in his unpublished manuscripts (''[[:de:Nietzsche-Ausgabe|KSA]]'' 11:35[58], p. 537)) and [[Emmanuel Levinas]] (who proposed an ethics of the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]).&lt;ref name="Margins"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas L. Donkel, ''The Theory of Difference: Readings in Contemporary Continental Thought'', SUNY Press, 2001, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a similar vein, [[Gilles Deleuze]]'s ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968) was an attempt to think difference as having an [[ontological]] privilege over identity, inverting the traditional relationship between those two concepts and implying that identities are only produced through processes of differentiation.

In [[ethics]], '''dual loyalty''' is loyalty to two separate interests that potentially [[logical consequence|entails]] a [[conflict of interest]].

A frequently cited example of the term "dual loyalty" is used in connection with [[physician]]s who must balance, on the one hand, the physician's loyalty to a [[patient]] (and/or the regulations that govern the physician-patient relationship), and on the other hand, the institution or country for which the physician serves. 

For example, a doctor who is asked by a government to assess a prisoner's fitness to withstand [[torture]] faces an enormous ethical dilemma because of the competing loyalties of the doctor to the state versus the [[medical ethics|physician's code of ethics]] and his/her commitment to a patient's [[human rights]].

{{Sufism|Ideas}}{{Sunni Islam}}
'''Fanaa''' ({{lang-ar|فناء}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|fanāʾ&amp;nbsp;}}'') in [[Sufism]] is the "passing away" or "annihilation" (of the [[nafs|self]]).&lt;ref name="harmless"&gt;Harmless, William. ''Mystics''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Fana means "to die before one dies", a concept highlighted by famous notable Muslim saints such as [[Rumi]] and later by [[Sultan Bahoo]].&lt;ref name="Bāhū1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sult̤ān Bāhū|title=Death Before Dying: The Sufi Poems of Sultan Bahu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlECx1j0B4IC|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92046-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fana represents a breaking down of the individual ego and a recognition of the fundamental unity of God, creation, and the individual self.&lt;ref name="harmless" /&gt; Persons having entered this enlightened state obtain awareness of the intrinsic unity ([[Tawhid]]) between [[Allah]] and all that exists, including the individual's mind.  It is coupled conceptually with [[baqaa]], subsistence, which is the state of pure consciousness of and abidance in God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fana in Sufism|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/fana-Sufism|publisher=Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Sources ==
Muslim scholars insist, that similar to other Sufi doctrines, Fana also based purely on the Islamic teachings. The [[Quran]] says:
{{quotation |"All things in creation suffer annihilation and there remains the face of the Lord in its majesty and bounty." Surat-L-Rehman 26-27 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=7 Renowned Translations|first1=Arabic to English Translation|title=Surat-L-Rehman 165|url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=55&amp;verse=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The state of Fana is represented by Rumi in Book Six of the [[Mathnawi]] where he writes:

In his book, Ain-ul-Faqr, Sultan Bahoo talks about spiritual levels of which Fana is one:

{{quotation |"Initially I was ''four'', then became ''three'', afterwards ''two'' and when I got out of Doi (being two), I became ''one'' with Allah."}}

The words reveal the journey of Oneness where 'four' means he, his [[Murshid]], [[Mohammad|Rasool]] and [[Allah]]. When he annihilates in his [[Murshid]], he remains 'three'. Then he annihilates in [[Mohammad|Rasool]] and he remains 'two'. Finally when he annihilates in Allah, he becomes 'One'. Hence, his journey of Fana(annihilation) completes and he becomes [[Al-Insan al-Kamil|the Universal Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Mohammad Najib-ur-Rehman|last1=Hazrat Sakhi Sultan|title=The Universal Man (Insan-e-Kamil)|publisher=Sultan-ul-Faqr Publications Regd.|isbn=9789699795183|page=277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlyMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA277&amp;dq=insan+e+kamil&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=insan%20e%20kamil&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fana fi Shaikh ===
This is the first level of Fana where the seeker annihilates in the being of his [[Murshid]]. This is only possible through Ishq-e-Murshid.

=== Fana fi Rasool ===
This is the second level of Fana where the seeker annihilates in the being of [[Mohammad|Rasool]]. This is only possible through Ishq-e-Rasool.

=== Fana Fillah ===
This is the third and final stage of Fana where the seeker annihilates in the essence of Allah attained only through [[Ishq|Ishq-e-Haqeeqi]].

The journal aims to enhance feminist philosophers' and women's position in the philosophical sphere and the world at large, as well as being a platform for philosophical research that engages the issues faced by wider society. FPQ prioritises aligning itself with people who work towards fighting oppression and achieving equality and fairness.&lt;ref name="IAPH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.women-philosophy.org/portfolio/new-journal-feminist-philosophy-quarterly/ |title=New Journal: Feminist Philosophy Quarterly

Taking issues of bias in publication seriously, FPQ has a triple-anonymous review policy. This means that authors, editors, and reviewers are all anonymous to one another. In addition to publishing peer reviewed scholarly articles, the journal also publishes a variety of invited and submitted symposia.
 
FPQ's online platform is hosted by [[Digital Commons]] (powered by [[bepress]]) at Scholarship at Western, in turn by [[University of Western Ontario|Western University]].

'''Francesco de' Vieri''', called '''Verino the second''' (1524-1591), was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[philosopher]].

He was the nephew of Francesco de' Vieri called Verino the first. At the [[University of Pisa|Studio di Pisa]] he was professor of [[logic]] and later of philosophy, since 1559 to 1590. He was criticized by colleagues for his yearn of a new [[Neoplatonism|platonic]] academy following [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]]. His main opponent was [[Girolamo Borri]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4462">'''Franz August Schmölders''' (28 November 1809 in [[Rhede]], [[Münsterland]] &amp;ndash; 21 February 1880 in [[Breslau]]) was a German orientalist. His focus was the Arabic language and literature.

==Education==
Schmölders studied from 1830 on philosophy and theology at the [[University of Bonn]]. Under the influence of professors Christian August Brandis, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Freytag, Christian Lassen and August Wilhelm Schlegel, he soon concentrated on the oriental, especially Arabic philosophy. He learned to Hebrew, Arabic, Avestan, Persian Syriac and Sanskrit.

During his studies Schmölders dealt especially with the Arabic translations of the writings of Aristotle. In 1835, he won with a text edition of the works of the Indian philosopher Bhartrihari the price of the Faculty of Arts. On 22 July 1836 he was a Dr. phil. PhD.

A scholarship from the Prussian Academy of Sciences allowed Schmölders after studying one-half-year stay in Paris, where he deepened his studies. He attended lectures by the great French Arabist [[silvestre de Sacy]], [[Joseph Toussaint Reinaud]] (1795-1867) and [[Pierre Amédée Jaubert]]. During his time in Paris he wrote his first book in French, in which he discussed the history of philosophy among the Arabs. It was published in 1842 by the publisher Firmin Didot. Shortly thereafter came Schmölders back to Bonn and performed his habilitation there.

== University career ==
On 22 December 1842 Schmölders held his inaugural lecture at the [[University of Bonn]]. As a lecturer, he was able to receive a steady income. The Prussian Minister Johann Albrecht Friedrich Eichhorn supported him with scholarships. After only one and a half years (1844) Schmölders became an Associate Professor of Oriental Languages and Literatures at the University of Breslau. He followed this calling on 29 June 1844.

In Breslau, Schmölders spent 16 years as university scholar and as a teacher. He provided part-time lesssons in Hebrew and French  at Matthew Gymnasium and taught with official permission also an English course, in which he tutored gifted students. On 1 May 1846 he became a full member in the German Oriental Society.

After the death of his older colleague Georg Heinrich Bernstein (1860) Schmölders received on 10 October's full professor of Oriental Studies. Thus he was able to quit his teaching at the high school. He worked for twenty years as a professor at the University and received during this time many honors at home and abroad.

== Further activities and heritage ==
Because of his language skills - he mastered 22 languages - Schmölders was in high demand outside the university. As a member of the Scientific Examination committee, he took exams in English and French. He worked as a sworn interpreter in court, e.g. the royal Appellate. His many obligations, his keen interest in teaching and an abdominal illness prevented him since the 1860s from further publications. His grandson [[Günter Schmölders]] became professor for economics in Breslau and Cologne, his grand-granddaughter [[Claudia Schmölders]] an author and cultural scholar in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schmoelders-stiftung.de/guenter-schmoelders/|title=Günter Schmölders – Schmölders Stiftung|website=www.schmoelders-stiftung.de|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Günter, Schmölders: Gut durchgekommen?“ Lebenserinnerungen.

'''Fyodor Avgustovich Stepun''' ({{lang-ru|Фёдор А́вгустович Степу́н}}; February 18, 1884 – February 23, 1965) (also known as Friedrich Steppuhn) was a [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Germans|German]] writer, philosopher, historian and [[sociologist]].&lt;ref name="slovo"&gt;{{cite web | author = Kantor, Vladimir| year = 2005| url  = http://magazines.russ.ru/slovo/2005/45/ka13.html|title = Fyodor Stepun: The Russian Philosopher Against Bolshevism and Nazism (Фёдор Степун: русский философ против большевизма и нацизма)| publisher  = Slovo magazine| accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Fyodor Avgustovich Stepun was born in Russia on 18 February 1884, in Moscow. After attending secondary school in Moscow he went as a student to Heidelberg, and there in 1910 he obtained his doctorate for a thesis on [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]]'s philosophy of history.

Between 1910 and 1914 Stepun edited the international philosophical journal, ''Logos'', and travelled across Russia lecturing on philosophy, literature and culture.

During the first World War he was an officer in a Siberian regiment, and after the Russian revolution was an army commissar under the [[Russian Provisional Government]].

From 1920 to 1922 he directed the state experimental theatre; but in 1922 he was deported from the [[Soviet Union]]. He settled in Germany, working first in [[Berlin]], and afterwards as a professor of sociology in [[Dresden]] (1926-1937). During this period he published in Russian his books on 'Life and creation' (1923) and 'Letters of an Artillery Ensign' (1925), as well as ''Wie war as moglich?'' (1929), ''Das Antlitz Russlands und das Gesicht der Revolution'' (1934) and ''The Russian Soul and Revolution'' (1936).  In 1937 he was expelled from his teaching-post by the Nazi authorities.

From 1946 he worked as a professor of Russian cultural studies at [[Munich University]], and published several works:  ''Vergangenes und Unvergangliches'' (1947; Russian version, ''Byvshee i Nesbyvsheesya'', 1956), ''Theater und Film'' (1953), ''Der Bolshewismus und die Christliche Existenz'' (1959), and in Russian 'Encounters' (1962).

Stepun was a fierce opponent of [[Bolshevism]], as well as [[Nazism]]. His philosophical doctrine has been described as [[Kantism|neo-Kantist]] [[transcendentalism]] linked with religious [[metaphysic]]s, close to the ideas of [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] and [[Nikolai Berdyaev]].&lt;ref name="krugosvet"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15735">The '''history of [[evolutionary psychology]]''' began with [[Charles Darwin]], who said that humans have social instincts that evolved by natural selection. Darwin's work inspired later psychologists such as [[William James]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] but for most of the 20th century psychologists focused more on behaviorism and proximate explanations for human behavior. [[E. O. Wilson]]'s landmark 1975 book, ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis|Sociobiology]]'', synthesized recent theoretical advances in evolutionary theory to explain social behavior in animals, including humans. [[Jerome H. Barkow|Jerome Barkow]], [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]] popularized the term "evolutionary psychology" in their 1992 book ''[[The Adapted Mind|The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and The Generation of Culture]]''.&lt;ref name="Tooby, John; Barkow, Jerome H.; Cosmides, Leda 1995"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Tooby, John |author2=Barkow, Jerome H. |author3=Cosmides, Leda |title=The Adapted mind: evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-19-510107-3 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like sociobiology before it, evolutionary psychology has been embroiled in controversy, but evolutionary psychologists see their field as gaining increased acceptance overall.

==19th century==
After his seminal work in developing theories of natural selection, Charles Darwin devoted much of his final years to the study of animal emotions and psychology. He wrote two books;''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' in 1871 and ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' in 1872 that dealt with topics related to evolutionary psychology. He introduced the concepts of [[sexual selection]] to explain the presence of animal structures that seemed unrelated to survival, such as the peacock's tail. He also introduced theories concerning [[group selection]] and [[kin selection]] to explain [[altruism]].&lt;ref name="moralanimal"&gt;Wright, Robert. The Moral Animal: Why We Are, the Way We Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology. Vintage. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin pondered why humans and animals were often generous to their group members. Darwin felt that acts of generosity decreased the fitness of generous individuals. This fact contradicted natural selection which favored the fittest individual. Darwin concluded that while generosity decreased the fitness of individuals, generosity would increase the fitness of a group. In this case, altruism arose due to competition between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Science of Good and Evil|last=Shermer|

==20th century==
Darwin's theory inspired [[William James]]'s [[Functional psychology|functionalist]] approach to psychology.&lt;ref name="Psychology"&gt;Schacter, Daniel L, Daniel Wegner and Daniel Gilbert. 2007. Psychology. Worth Publishers. pp. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; At the core of his theory was a system of "instincts."&lt;ref name="Buss 1"/&gt; James wrote that humans had many instincts, even more than other animals.&lt;ref name="Buss 1"/&gt; These instincts, he said, could be overridden by experience and by each other, as many of the instincts were actually in conflict with each other.&lt;ref name="Buss 1"&gt;Buss, David M. Evolutionary psychology: the new science of the mind. Pearson. 2008. Chapter 1, p. 2-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their [http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/EP-primer.html Evolutionary Psychology Primer] Tooby and Cosmides make note of James' perspective, and also quote him:

:"We do not realize that 'normal' behavior needs to be explained at all. This "instinct blindness" makes the study of psychology difficult. To get past this problem, James suggested that we try to make the "natural seem strange":

::''It takes...a mind debauched by learning to carry the process of making the natural seem strange, so far as to ask for the why of any instinctive human act. To the metaphysician alone can such questions occur as: Why do we smile, when pleased, and not scowl? Why are we unable to talk to a crowd as we talk to a single friend? Why does a particular maiden turn our wits so upside-down? The common man can only say, Of course we smile, of course our heart palpitates at the sight of the crowd, of course we love the maiden, that beautiful soul clad in that perfect form, so palpably and flagrantly made for all eternity to be loved!''

::''And so, probably, does each animal feel about the particular things it tends to do in the presence of particular objects. ... To the lion it is the lioness which is made to be loved; to the bear, the she-bear. To the broody hen the notion would probably seem monstrous that there should be a creature in the world to whom a nestful of eggs was not the utterly fascinating and precious and never-to-be-too-much-sat-upon object which it is to her.''

::''Thus we may be sure that, however mysterious some animals' instincts may appear to us, our instincts will appear no less mysterious to them.'' (William James, 1890)

:In our view, William James was right about evolutionary psychology. Making the natural seem strange is unnatural -- it requires the twisted outlook seen, for example, in Gary Larson cartoons. Yet it is a pivotal part of the enterprise. Many psychologists avoid the study of natural competences, thinking that there is nothing there to be explained."

According to [[Noam Chomsky]], perhaps Anarchist thinker [[Peter Kropotkin]] could be credited as having founded evolutionary psychology, when in his 1902 book [[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]] he argued that the human instinct for cooperation and mutual aid could be seen as stemming from evolutionary adaption.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/200401--.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] made a reference to "evolutionary psychology" in his 1919 book ''An Introduction to Social Psychology'': "It is only a comparative and evolutionary psychology that can provide the needed basis (for psychology); and this could not be created before the work of Darwin had convinced men of the continuity of human with animal evolution as regards all bodily characters, and had prepared the way for the quickly following recognition of the similar continuity of man’s mental evolution with that of the animal world." (p.&amp;nbsp;16)

==Post world war II==
While Darwin's theories on natural selection gained acceptance in the early part of the 20th century, his theories on evolutionary psychology were largely ignored. Only after the second world war, in the 1950s, did interest increase in the systematic study of animal behavior. It was during this period that the modern field of [[ethology]] emerged. [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] were pioneers in developing the theoretical framework for ethology for which they would receive a Nobel prize in 1973.

[[Desmond Morris]]'s book ''[[The Naked Ape]]'' attempted to frame human behavior in the context of evolution, but his explanations failed to convince academics because they were based on a teleological (goal-oriented) understanding of evolution. For example, he said that the pair bond evolved so that men who were out hunting could trust that their mates back home were not having sex with other males.&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

==Sociobiology==
In 1975, [[E. O. Wilson]] built upon the works of Lorenz and Tinbergen by combining studies of animal behavior, social behavior and evolutionary theory in his book ''[[Sociobiology:The New Synthesis]].'' Wilson included a chapter on human behavior. Wilson's application of evolutionary analysis to human behavior caused bitter debate.&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. [[The Blank Slate]]. New York: Penguin. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thirdchimpanzee"&gt;Diamond, Jared. The Third Chimpanzee.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication of ''Sociobiology'', evolutionary thinking for the first time had an identifiable presence in the field of psychology.&lt;ref name="Psychology"/&gt; E. O. Wilson argues that the field of evolutionary psychology is essentially the same as "human [[sociobiology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociobiology |authorlink=E. O. Wilson |last=Wilson |first=E. O. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v7lV9tz8fXAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=Human+sociobiology+...now+called+evolutionary+psychology+...+emerged+as+its+own+field+of+study+...+from+biology+and+social+science |quote=Human sociobiology, now often called evolutionary psychology, has in the last quarter of a century emerged as its own field of study, drawing on theory and data from both biology and the social sciences. |isbn=978-0-674-00235-7 |year=2000 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward H. Hagen writes in ''The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology'' that sociobiology is, despite the public controversy regarding the applications to humans, "one of the scientific triumphs of the twentieth century." "Sociobiology is now part of the core research and curriculum of virtually all biology departments, and it is a foundation of the work of almost all field biologists" Sociobiological research on nonhuman organisms has increased dramatically and appears continuously in the world's top scientific journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.The more general term [[behavioral ecology]] is commonly used as substitute for the term sociobiology in order to avoid the public controversy.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2005. Chapter 5 by Edward H. Hagen .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use of the term "evolutionary psychology"==
The term ''evolutionary psychology'' was used by American biologist [[Michael Ghiselin]] in a 1973 article published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ghiselin MT |title=Darwin and Evolutionary Psychology: Darwin initiated a radically new way of studying behavior |journal=Science |volume=179 |issue=4077 |pages=964–968 |year=1973 |pmid=17842154 |doi=10.1126/science.179.4077.964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome Barkow, Leda Cosmides and John Tooby popularized the term "evolutionary psychology" in their 1992 book ''The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and The Generation of Culture''.&lt;ref name="Tooby, John; Barkow, Jerome H.; Cosmides, Leda 1995"/&gt;

In contrast to sociobiology and behavioral ecology, evolutionary psychology emphasizes that organisms are "adaptation executors" rather than "fitness maximizers."&lt;ref name="Buss, D. M. 1995"&gt;Buss, D. M. (1995). Evolutionary psychology: A new paradigm for psychological science. Psychological Inquiry, 6, 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, organisms have emotional, motivational and cognitive adaptations that generally increased inclusive fitness in the past but may not do so in the present. This distinction may explain some maladaptive behaviors that are the result of "fitness lags" between ancestral and modern environments.&lt;ref name="Buss, D. M. 1995"/&gt; For example, our ancestrally developed desires for fat, sugar and salt often lead to health problems in modern environment where these are readily available in large quantities.

Also, in contrast to sociobiology and behavioral ecology (which mostly study non-human animal behavior), rather than focus primarily on overt behavior, EP attempts to identify underlying psychological adaptations (including emotional, motivational and cognitive mechanisms), and how these mechanisms interact with the developmental and current environmental influences to produce behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Smith2001.pdf Controversies in the evolutionary social sciences: a guide for the perplexed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ni9ggiew1UC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=sociobiology+evolutionary+psychology+controversy Evolutionary Psychology By Lance Workman, Will Reader]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1990, introductory psychology textbooks scarcely mentioned Darwin.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 1-24"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 1, p 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, evolutionary psychology was treated as a fringe theory,&lt;ref name="Confer 2010"&gt;[http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/Group/BussLAB/pdffiles/evolutionary_psychology_AP_2010.pdf Confer, et al., 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and evolutionary psychologists depicted themselves as an embattled minority.&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt; Coverage in psychology textbooks was largely hostile.&lt;ref name="Confer 2010"/&gt; According to evolutionary psychologists, current coverage in psychology textbooks is usually neutral or balanced.&lt;ref name="Confer 2010"/&gt;

The presence that evolutionary theory holds in psychology has been steadily increasing.&lt;ref name="Psychology"/&gt; According to its proponents, evolutionary psychology now occupies a central place in psychological science.&lt;ref name="Confer 2010"/&gt;

[[File:Hugh McColl.gif|thumb|right|200px|Hugh MacColl]]
'''Hugh MacColl''' (1831–1909) was a Scottish mathematician, [[logician]] and novelist.

==Life==
MacColl was the youngest son of a poor [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] family that was at least partly [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking. Hugh's father died when he was still an infant, and Hugh was educated largely thanks to the efforts of his elder brother [[Malcolm MacColl]], an [[Scottish Episcopalian|Episcopalian]] clergyman and friend and political ally of [[William Ewart Gladstone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB12|wstitle=MacColl, Malcolm|volume= 2|page=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his acquaintanceship with Gladstone, Malcolm MacColl persuaded the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician to provide funds for Hugh's education at Oxford. It was proposed to send him to Oxford University's [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St. Edmund Hall]], but Gladstone made this conditional on Hugh MacColl agreeing to take orders in the [[Church of England]].{{clarify|date=July 2014}} Hugh MacColl refused this condition and, as a result, never obtained a university education, which may have limited his contribution to philosophy, and certainly prevented him from ever obtaining a formal academic position.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Gladstone-MacColl Correspondence, British Library&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few years working in different areas of Great Britain, MacColl relocated to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], in France on the Channel, where he developed the greater part of his work and became a [[French citizen]]. MacColl was not obscure during his time. He was a lifelong regular contributor to the ''Educational Times''. His correspondents included the logicians [[William Stanley Jevons]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. He also corresponded, and argued in print, with the young [[Bertrand Russell]], and reviewed [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s 1898 ''Universal Algebra'' for ''Mind'' magazine.

==Works==
He is known for three main accomplishments:

* During 1877-79, while working out a problem involving [[integral|integration]], he published a four-part article establishing the first known variant of the [[propositional calculus]], terming it the "calculus of equivalent statements", preceding [[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''Begriffschrifft''. He subsequently published 11 articles in ''Mind'' magazine, during the period 1880–1908, and a text,&lt;ref&gt;''Symbolic Logic and Its Applications'', 1906. Longmans, Green&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilson, Edwin Bidwell|authorlink=Edwin Bidwell Wilson|title=Review: ''L'Algèbre de la Logique'', par Louis Couturat; ''Symbolic Logic and its Applications'', by Hugh MacColl; ''The Development of Symbolic Logic'' by A. T. Shearman|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1908|volume=14|issue=4|pages=175–191|url= http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1908-14-04/S0002-9904-1908-01573-8/S0002-9904-1908-01573-8.pdf|doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1908-01573-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to attract the attention of philosophers to his work.
*[[Clarence Irving Lewis]] credited MacColl's late work on the nature of implication as the source of the basic ideas of Lewis's innovative work in [[modal logic]].
* MacColl's work represents one of the first treatments of logical pluralism where he explores the possibilities of modal logic, logic of fiction, [[connexive logic]], [[many-valued logic]] and [[probability logic]].

MacColl also published two novels, ''[[Mr. Stranger's Sealed Packet]]'' (1889), concerning a journey to Mars and a utopian Martian society, and ''Ednor Whitlock'' (1891), dealing with a crisis of faith occasioned by exposure to new scientific ideas. While described by a recent critic as "best left unread",&lt;ref&gt;Stein Haugom Olsen, "Why Hugh MacColl is not, and will never be, part of any literary canon" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=veLr_ux9LAUC ''The Quality of Literature: Linguistic Studies in Literary Evaluation''], ed. Willie van Peer, [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the novels reveal social and moral values to which the author gave full expression in his 1909 publication ''Man's Origin, Destiny, and Duty'', an apology for [[Christianity]].

==Legacy==
There is presently a long-term MacColl Project, a joint venture of [[Greifswald University]] in Germany and the [[University of Oslo]], which intends to publish a critical edition of his work. Furthermore, the group of logic and [[epistemology]] at the [[Université Lille Nord de France|University of Lille]] (France) develop MacColl's suggestions for a dynamic [[free logic]]. The December 1999 issue of the magazine ''[[Nordic Journal of Philosophical Logic]]'' published the proceedings of a 1998 conference devoted to MacColl's work.

'''Human subject research''' is systematic, scientific investigation that can be either interventional (a "trial") or observational (no "test article") and  involves [[human being]]s as research subjects. Human subject research can be either medical (clinical) research or non-medical (e.g., social science) research.&lt;ref name="uci"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.research.uci.edu/ora/hrpp/definition.htm| title = Definition of Human Subject Research| publisher = Research Administration, [[University of California, Irvine]] | access-date = 2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic investigation incorporates both the collection and analysis of data in order to answer a specific question. Medical human subject research often involves analysis of [[biological specimens]], [[epidemiological]] and behavioral studies and medical chart review studies.&lt;ref name="uci"/&gt; (A specific, and especially heavily regulated, type of medical human subject research is the "[[clinical trial]]", in which drugs, vaccines and medical devices are evaluated.) On the other hand, human subject research in the social sciences often involves [[survey (human research)|surveys]] which consist of questions to a particular group of people. [[Survey methodology]] includes questionnaires, [[interviews]], and [[focus groups]].

Human subject research is used in various fields, including research into basic [[biology]], [[clinical medicine]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], and [[anthropology]]. As research has become formalized, the academic community has developed formal definitions of "human subject research", largely in response to [[Unethical human experimentation|abuses]] of human subjects.

==Human subjects==
The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) defines a human research subject as a living individual about whom a research investigator (whether a professional or a student) obtains data through 1) intervention or interaction with the individual, or 2) identifiable private information ({{USCFR|32|219|102|(f)}}). (Lim, 1990)&lt;ref name="utexas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/research/rsc/humansubjects/whatis.html |title=What is Human Subjects Research? |publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin]] |access-date=2012-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207032034/http://www.utexas.edu/research/rsc/humansubjects/whatis.html |archive-date=2012-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As defined by HHS regulations:
 
"Intervention"- physical procedures by which data is gathered and the manipulation of the subject and/or their environment for research purposes [{{USCFR|45|46|102|(f)}}]&lt;ref name="utexas"/&gt;

"Interaction"- communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and subject [{{USCFR|45|46|102|(f)}}])&lt;ref name="utexas"/&gt;

"Private Information"-  information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information which has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public [{{USCFR|45|46|102|(f)}}] )]&lt;ref name="utexas"/&gt;

"Identifiable information"- specific information that can be used to identify an individual.&lt;ref name="utexas"/&gt;

===Human subject rights===
In 2010, the National Institute of Justice in the United States published recommended rights of human subjects:
* Voluntary, informed consent
* Respect for persons: treated as autonomous agents
* The right to end participation in research at any time&lt;ref name="socra"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://materiais.dbio.uevora.pt/MA/Modulo2/Artigos/SoCRA-Perlman.pdf | last = Perlman | first = David | name-list-format = vanc | title = Ethics in Clinical Research a History Of Human Subject Protections and Practical Implementation of Ethical Standards| publisher = Society of Clinical Research Associates | date=May 2004 | access-date = 2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to safeguard integrity&lt;ref name="socra"/&gt;
* Benefits should outweigh cost
* Protection from physical, mental and emotional harm
* Access to information regarding research&lt;ref name="socra"/&gt;
* Protection of privacy and well-being&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.nij.gov/funding/humansubjects/ | title = Human Subject &amp; Privacy Protection| publisher = [[National Institute of Justice]] | date= 2010-04-20| access-date = 2012-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical guidelines ==
{{main article|Guidelines for human subject research}}
Ethical guidelines that govern the use of human subjects in research are a fairly new construct. In 1906 some regulations were put in place in the United States to protect subjects from abuses. After the passage of the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] in 1906, regulatory bodies such as the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and [[institutional review board]]s (IRBs) were gradually introduced. The policies that these institutions implemented served to minimize harm to the participant's mental and/or physical well being.

===Nuremberg Code===
{{main article|Nuremberg Code}}

In 1947, German physicians who conducted deadly or debilitating experiments on concentration camp prisoners were prosecuted as war criminals in the [[Nuremberg Trials]]. That same year, the Allies established the Nuremberg Code, the first international document to support the concept that "the voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential". Individual consent was emphasized in the Nuremberg Code in order to prevent prisoners of war, patients, prisoners, and soldiers from being coerced into becoming human subjects. In addition, it was emphasized in order to inform participants of the risk-benefit outcomes of experiments.

===Declaration of Helsinki===
{{main article|Declaration of Helsinki}}
The Declaration of Helsinki was established in 1964 to regulate international research involving human subjects. Established by the [[World Medical Association]], the declaration recommended guidelines for medical doctors conducting [[biomedical research]] that involves human subjects. Some of these guidelines included the principles that "research protocols should be reviewed by an independent committee prior to initiation" and that "research with humans should be based on results from laboratory animals and experimentation".

{{main article|Belmont Report}}The [[Belmont Report]] was created by the [[National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research]] to describe the ethical behaviors that involve researching human subjects. By looking primarily at biomedical and behavioral research that involve human subjects, the report was generated to promise that ethical standards are followed during research of human subjects.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html|title=The Belmont Report|date=2010-01-28|work=HHS.gov|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;There are three standards that serve as the baseline for the report and how human subjects are to be researched. The three guidelines are [[beneficence (ethics)]], justice and respect for persons. [[Beneficence (ethics)]] is described as protecting the well-being of the persons and respecting their decisions by being ethical and protecting the subjects from harm. The two rules of beneficence are maximizing the benefits of research and minimizing any possible risks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com.proxy2.cl.msu.edu/sp-3.24.1b/ovidweb.cgi?QS2=434f4e1a73d37e8ca9c2ed569e2a6bcb0f412b007c9b7e542466c49ab08d37370c8ea9c4c0a8f1ea8d16c7f33868d478f9d2dde9b127fdea5dd68cf032bf07e4da759c36ff1f61f73a08f600c3a2b9c113899a7d92abe8f3b6751ad5fcb460ff855a1e2c4c074aa7660812a2e4d3534035517d276e94f0409b7c3b19726bbab545c714b76a5e819efbb2ce50697c5319ae941d65e1436f97104a8e682dbd2b50577476329e92b732b6eb25118ceca6ee35dfd045fed78335c5beff50b56398701cc2c6feeb22e55aaa2decd62f2d13ad|title=MSU Authentication {{!}} Michigan State University|website=ovidsp.tx.ovid.com.proxy2.cl.msu.edu|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is the job of the researcher to inform the persons of the benefits as well as the risks of human subject research. Justice is important because it causes the researchers to be fair in their research findings and share what they have found, whether the information is good or bad.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The selection process of the subject is supposed to be fair and not separate due to race, sexual orientation or ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.umf.maine.edu/irb/other-links/the-belmont-report/|title=The Belmont Report  {{!}}  Institutional Review Board|website=www2.umf.maine.edu|language=English|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, respect for persons explains that at any point a person who is involved in a study can decide whether they want to participate, not to participate or withdraw themselves from the study altogether. Two rules of respect for persons involve the person being autonomous and persons with diminished autonomy and entitled to protection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;The sole purpose of these guidelines is to ensure autonomy and to protect against those with a lesser chance to remain autonomous because of something out of their control.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Clinical trials==
{{main article|Clinical trial}}
{{Expand section|date=July 2015}}
Clinical trials are [[experiment]]s done in [[clinical research]]. Such [[Prospective cohort study|prospective]] biomedical or behavioral research studies on human participants are designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions, including new [[therapy|treatments]] (such as novel [[vaccine]]s, [[pharmaceutical drug|drugs]], [[medical nutrition therapy|dietary choices]], [[dietary supplement]]s, and [[medical device]]s) and known interventions that warrant further study and comparison. Clinical trials generate data on [[safety]] and [[efficacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Clinical Trials |url=https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/clinical_trials.pdf |publisher=Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are conducted only after they have received [[institutional review board|health authority/ethics committee]] approval in the country where approval of the therapy is sought. These authorities are responsible for vetting the risk/benefit ratio of the trial - their approval does not mean that the therapy is 'safe' or effective, only that the trial may be conducted.

Depending on product type and development stage, investigators initially enroll volunteers and/or patients into small [[Pilot experiment|pilot studies]], and subsequently conduct progressively larger scale comparative studies. Clinical trials can vary in size and cost, and they can involve a single research center or [[multicenter trial|multiple centers]], in one country or in multiple countries. [[Clinical study design]] aims to ensure the scientific validity and [[reproducibility]] of the results.

Trials can be quite costly, depending on a number of factors. The sponsor may be a governmental organization or a [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]], [[biotechnology]] or [[medical device]] company. Certain functions necessary to the trial, such as monitoring and lab work, may be managed by an [[outsource]]d partner, such as a [[contract research organization]] or a central laboratory.

==Human subjects in psychology and sociology==

===Stanford prison experiment===
{{main article|Stanford prison experiment}}
A study conducted by [[Philip Zimbardo]] in 1971 examined the effect of social roles on college students at [[Stanford University]]. Twenty-four male students were assigned to a random role of a prisoner or guard to simulate a mock prison in one of Stanford's basements. After only six days, the abusive behavior of the guards and the psychological suffering of prisoners proved significant enough to halt the two-week-long experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Zimbardo, P.G. (2007). ''The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil''. New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; Human subjects play a role in this experiment. This study would show whether or not prisoners and guards have conflict which make conflict inevitable. This conflict would be due to possible sadistic behavior of guards (dispositional) or due to the hostile environment of the prison (positional). Due to the fact that prisoners could lack respect for the law and guards could behave in a hostile manner due to the power structure of the social environment that are within prisons. Yet, if prisoners and guards behaved in a non aggressive way, this would support the dispositional hypothesis. If the prisoners were just to behave in the same way that people did in real life, this would support the positional hypotheses. Using human subjects for this experiment is vital because the results is based on the way a human would react, with behaviors only humans obtain. Human subjects are the best way to get successful results from this type of experiment. The results of this experiment showed that people will readily conform to the specific social roles they are supposed to play. The prison environment played a part in making the guards behavior more brutal, due to the fact that none of the participants showed this type of behavior beforehand. Most of the guards had a hard time believing they had been acting in such ways. This evidence concludes this to be positional behavior, meaning the behavior was due to the hostile environment of the prison.   &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/zimbardo.html|title=Stanford Prison Experiment {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milgram experiment===
{{main article|Milgram Experiment}}
In 1961, [[Yale University]] psychologist [[Stanley Milgram]] led a series of experiments to determine to what extent an individual would obey instructions given by an experimenter. Placed in a room with the experimenter, subjects played the role of a "teacher" to a "learner" situated in a separate room. The subjects were instructed to administer an electric shock to the learner when the learner answered incorrectly to a set of questions. The intensity of this electric shock was to be increased for every incorrect answer. The learner was a confederate (i.e. actor), and the shocks were faked, but the subjects were led to believe otherwise. Both prerecorded sounds of electric shocks and the confederate's pleas for the punishment to stop were audible to the "teacher" throughout the experiment. When the subject raised questions or paused, the experimenter insisted that the experiment should continue. Despite widespread speculation that most participants would not continue to "shock" the learner, 65 percent of participants in Milgram's initial trial complied until the end of the experiment, continuing to administer shocks to the confederate with purported intensities of up to "450 volts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Milgram S | title = Some conditions of obedience and disobedience to authority | journal = International Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 259–76 | date = October 1968 | pmid = 5724528 | doi = 10.1177/001872676501800105 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ObedStudy&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Milgram S | title = Behavioral Study of Obedience | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 67 | issue = 4 | pages = 371–8 | date = October 1963 | pmid = 14049516 | doi = 10.1037/h0040525 | url = http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1981/A1981LC33300001.pdf | archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20110611105753/http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1981/A1981LC33300001.pdf | archive-date = June 11, 2011  | dead-url = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many participants questioned the experimenter and displayed various signs of discomfort, when the experiment was repeated, 65 percent of subjects were willing to obey instructions to administer the shocks through the final one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blass |first=Thomas | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Milgram paradigm after 35 years: Some things we now know about obedience to authority |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=955–978 |year=1999 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1999.tb00134.x|ref=harv}} [http://neuron4.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Psyc591Readings/Blass1999.pdf as PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asch conformity experiments===
{{main article|Asch conformity experiments}}
Psychologist [[Solomon Asch]]'s classic conformity experiment in 1951 involved one subject participant and multiple confederates; they were asked to provide answers to a variety of different low-difficulty questions.&lt;ref name="Asch1951"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Asch SE | year = 1951 | chapter = Effects of group pressure on the modification and distortion of judgments | veditors = Guetzkow H | title = Groups, Leadership and Men | pages = 177–190 | location = Pittsburgh, PA | publisher = Carnegie Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; In every scenario, the multiple confederates gave their answers in turn, and the subject participant subject was allowed to answer last. In a [[control group]] of participants, the percentage of error was less than one percent. However, when the confederates unanimously chose an incorrect answer, 75 percent of the subject participants agreed with the majority at least once. The study has been regarded as significant evidence for the power of [[social influence]] and conformity.&lt;ref name="Milgram"&gt;Milgram, S. (1961).

===Robber's Cave study===
A classic advocate of [[Realistic conflict theory]], [[Muzafer Sherif]]'s Robber's Cave experiment shed light on how group competition can foster hostility and prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Whitley BE, Kite ME | title = The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|pages=325–330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1961 study, two groups of ten boys each who were not "naturally" hostile were grouped together without knowledge of one another in Robber's Cave State Park, Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="Mookref"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mook | first = Douglass | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2004 | publisher = Greenwood Press | title = Classic Experiments in Psychology }}&lt;/ref&gt; The twelve-year-old boys bonded with their own groups for a week before the groups were set in competition with each other in games such as tug-of-war and football. In light of this competition, the groups resorted to name-calling and other displays of resentment, such as burning the other group's team flag. The hostility continued and worsened until the end of the three-week study, when the groups were forced to work together to solve problems.&lt;ref name= Mookref /&gt;

===Bystander effect===
{{main article|Bystander effect}}
The [[bystander effect]] is demonstrated in a series of famous experiments by [[Bibb Latane]] and [[John M. Darley|John Darley]]&lt;ref name= Mookref /&gt; In each of these experiments, participants were confronted with a type of emergency, such as the witnessing of a seizure or smoke entering through air vents. A common phenomenon was observed that as the number of witnesses or "bystanders" increases, so does the time it takes for individuals to respond to the emergency. This effect has been shown to promote the [[diffusion of responsibility]] by concluding that, when surrounded by others, the individual expects someone else to take action.&lt;ref name= Mookref/&gt;

===Cognitive dissonance===
{{main article|Cognitive dissonance}}
Human subjects have been commonly used in experiments testing the theory of [[cognitive dissonance]] after the landmark study by [[Leon Festinger]] and [[Merrill Carlsmith]].&lt;ref name="Cooperref"&gt;{{cite book | last = Cooper | first = Joel | year = 2007 | title = Cognitive Dissonance, Fifty Years of a Classic Theory | publisher = SAGE Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Festinger and Carlsmith devised a situation in which participants would undergo excessively tedious and monotonous tasks. After the completion of these tasks, the subjects were instructed to help the experiment continue in exchange for a variable amount of money. All the subjects had to do was simply inform the next "student" waiting outside the testing area (who was secretly a confederate) that the tasks involved in the experiment were interesting and enjoyable. It was expected that the participants wouldn't fully agree with the information they were imparting to the student, and after complying, half of the participants were awarded $1, and the others were awarded $20. A subsequent survey showed that, by a large margin, those who received less money for essentially "lying" to the student came to believe that the tasks were far more enjoyable than their highly paid counterparts.&lt;ref name=Cooperref/&gt;

=== Vehicle safety ===
Throughout the years, many studies have been done on human subjects aiding towards a greater purpose. Human subject research is used across many industries, with one of those being the [[automotive industry]]. Research has shown that civilian volunteers decided to participate in vehicle safety research to help [[Car|automobile]] designers create more impactful and sustainable safety restraints for vehicles. This research allows designers to inquire more data on the tolerance of a human body in the event of an automobile accident to better improve safety features in automobiles. Some of the tests conducted ranged from sled runs evaluating head-neck injuries, [[airbag]] tests, and even tests involving [[Military vehicle|military vehicles]] and their constraint systems. It is important to note that from thousands of tests involving human subjects, results indicate no serious injuries were persistent. This fact is largely due to the preparation efforts of the researchers to ensure all ethical guidelines are followed and to ensure the safety and well-being of their subjects. Although this research provides positive contributions, there are some drawbacks and resistance to human subject research for crash testing due to the liability of injury and the lack of facilities that have appropriate machinery to perform such experiments. Overall, the experiments have helped contribute to the knowledge of human tolerance for injury in crash impacts. This research is additional data from which testing with [[cadaver|cadavers]] or [[Crash test dummy|crash test dummies]] would prevent us from discovering. [[Cadaver|Cadavers]] and [[Crash test dummy|crash test dummies]] still provide meaningful purpose when testing for higher tolerance tests beyond human capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Bradford LL | title = Vehicle safety research integration: symposium | location = Washington | date = May 1973 | publisher = proceedings. Washington: USGPO | pages = 87–98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social media ===
The increased use of [[social media]] as a data source for researchers has led to new uncertainties regarding the definition of human subject research. [[Privacy]], [[confidentiality]], and [[informed consent]] are key concerns, yet it is unclear when social media users qualify as human subjects. Moreno et al. conclude that if access to the social media content is public, information is identifiable but not private, and information gathering requires no interaction with the person who posted it online, then the research is unlikely to qualify as human subjects research.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moreno MA, Goniu N, Moreno PS, Diekema D | title = Ethics of social media research: common concerns and practical considerations | journal = Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking | volume = 16 | issue = 9 | pages = 708–13 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23679571 | pmc = 3942703 | doi = 10.1089/cyber.2012.0334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Defining features of human subject research, according to federal regulations, are that the researchers interact directly with the subject or obtain identifiable private information about the subject.&lt;ref name="utexas" /&gt; Social media research may or may not meet this definition. A research institution’s [[institutional review board]] (IRB) is often responsible for reviewing potential research on human subjects, but IRB protocols regarding social media research may be vague or outdated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Concerns regarding privacy and informed consent have surfaced regarding multiple social media studies. A research project by [[Harvard University|Harvard]] sociologists, known as "Tastes, Ties, and Time," utilized data from [[Facebook]] profiles of students at an “anonymous, northeastern American university” that was quickly identified as Harvard, potentially placing the privacy of the human subjects at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Harvards-Privacy-Meltdown/128166|title=Harvard's Privacy Meltdown|date=2011-07-10|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data set was removed from public access shortly after the issue was identified.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmer|first=Michael | name-list-format = vanc |date=2010-12-01|title=“But the data is already public”: on the ethics of research in Facebook|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-010-9227-5|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|volume=12|issue=4|pages=313–325|doi=10.1007/s10676-010-9227-5|issn=1388-1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was complicated by the fact that the research project was partially funded by the [[National Science Foundation]], which mandates the projects it funds to engage in [[data sharing]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A study by [[Facebook]] and researchers at [[Cornell University]], published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] in 2014, collected data from hundreds of thousands of Facebook users after temporarily removing certain types of emotional content from their [[News Feed]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kramer AD, Guillory JE, Hancock JT | title = Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 24 | pages = 8788–90 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24889601 | pmc = 4066473 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1320040111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many considered this a violation of the requirement for informed consent in human subjects research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/opinion/jaron-lanier-on-lack-of-transparency-in-facebook-study.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Should Facebook Manipulate Users?|date=2014-06-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@JamesGrimmelmann/illegal-unethical-and-mood-altering-8b93af772688|title=Illegal, Immoral, and Mood-Altering|last=Grimmelmann|first=James | name-list-format = vanc |date=2014-09-23|website=James Grimmelmann|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the data was collected by Facebook, a private company, in a manner that was consistent with its Data Use Policy and user terms and agreements, the Cornell IRB board determined that the study did not fall under its jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It has been argued that that this study broke the law nonetheless by violating state laws regarding informed consent.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Others have noted that speaking out against these research methods may be counterproductive, as private companies will likely continue to experiment on users, but will be dis-incentivized from sharing their methods or findings with scientists or the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2014/06/28/in-defense-of-facebook/ | title = In defense of Facebook | vauthors = Yarkoni T |date=2014-06-29|work=|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an “Editorial Expression of Concern” that was added to the online version of the research paper, PNAS states that while they “deemed it appropriate to publish the paper... It is nevertheless a matter of concern that the collection of the data by Facebook may have involved practices that were not fully consistent with the principles of obtaining informed consent and allowing participants to opt out.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Moreno et al.’s recommended considerations for social media research are: 1) determine if the study qualifies as human subject research, 2) consider the risk level of the content, 3) present research and motives accurately when engaging on social media, 4) provide contact information throughout the consent process, 5) make sure data is not identifiable or searchable (avoid direct quotes that may be identifiable with an online search), 6) consider developing project privacy policies in advance, and 7) be aware that each state has its own laws regarding informed consent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Social media sites offer great potential as a data source by providing access to hard-to-reach research subjects and groups, capturing the natural, “real-world” responses of subjects, and providing affordable and efficient data collection methods.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/07/facebook-study-science-experiment-research|title=Stop complaining about the Facebook study.

==Unethical human experimentation==
{{main article|Unethical human experimentation}}
Unethical human experimentation violates the principles of [[medical ethics]]. It has been performed by countries including [[Nazi human experimentation|Nazi Germany]], [[Japanese war crimes#Human experimentation and biological warfare|Imperial Japan]], [[Human experimentation in North Korea|North Korea]], the [[Unethical human experimentation in the United States|United States]], and the [[Poison laboratory of the Soviet secret services|Soviet Union]]. Examples include [[Project MKUltra]], [[Unit 731]], [[Totskoye nuclear exercise]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Живущие в стеклянном доме|url = http://www.svoboda.org/content/article/27214509.html|newspaper = Радио Свобода|access-date = 2015-08-31|language = Russian|first = Юрий|last = Федоров }}&lt;/ref&gt; the experiments of [[Josef Mengele]], and the human experimentation conducted by [[Chester M. Southam]].

Nazi Germany performed human experimentation on large numbers of prisoners (including children), largely [[Jews]] from across Europe, but also [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Sinti]], [[Poles|ethnic Poles]], [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet POWs]] and disabled Germans, by Nazi Germany in its [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] mainly in the early 1940s, during [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]. Prisoners were [[coercion|forced]] into participating; they did not willingly volunteer and no [[informed consent|consent]] was given for the procedures. Typically, the experiments resulted in death, [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[disfigurement]] or permanent [[disability]], and as such are considered as examples of [[medical torture]]. After the war, these crimes were tried at what became known as the [[Doctors' Trial]], and the abuses perpetrated led to the development of the [[Nuremberg Code]].&lt;ref name="Angel of Death: Josef Mengele"&gt;{{cite web|title=Angel of Death: Josef Mengele|url=http://auschwitz.dk/Mengele.htm|publisher=Auschwitz website |access-date=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Nuremberg Trials]], 23 Nazi doctors and scientists were prosecuted for the unethical treatment of concentration camp inmates, who were often used as research subjects with fatal consequences. Of those 23, 15 were convicted, 7 were condemned to death, 9 received prison sentences from 10 years to life, and 7 were acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Mitscherlich A, Mielke F | chapter = Epilogue: Seven Were Hanged| veditors = Annas GJ, Grodin MA | title = The Nazi Doctors And The Nuremberg Code - Human Rights in Human Experimentation | location = New York | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1992 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=4P04DuPIfAYC&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 105–107]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Unit 731]], a department of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] located near [[Harbin]] (then in the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]], in northeast China), experimented on prisoners by conducting [[vivisection]]s, [[Dismemberment|dismemberments]], and bacterial inoculations. It induced epidemics on a very large scale from 1932 onward through the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]].&lt;ref name="gold"/&gt; It also conducted biological and chemical weapons tests on prisoners and captured POWs. With the expansion of the empire during [[World War II]], similar units were set up in conquered cities such as [[Nanking]] ([[Unit 1644]]), [[Beijing]] ([[Unit 1855]]), [[Guangzhou]] ([[Unit 8604]]) and [[Singapore]] ([[Unit 9420]]). After the war, Supreme Commander of the Occupation [[Douglas MacArthur]] gave immunity in the name of the [[United States]] to [[Shirō Ishii]] and all members of the units in exchange for all of the results of their experiments.&lt;ref name="gold"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gold | first = H | isbn = 0-8048-3565-9 | title = Unit 731 Testimony | year = 2003 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=cprBEpxvexgC&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 109] | publisher = [[Tuttle Publishing]] | edition = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, [[Fort Detrick]] in Maryland was the headquarters of US biological warfare experiments. [[Operation Whitecoat]] involved the injection of infectious agents into military forces to observe their effects in human subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/file_on_4/4701196.stm | work= [[BBC News]] | title=Hidden history of US germ testing | date= 2006-02-13 | access-date=2010-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent human experiments in the United States have also been characterized as [[medical ethics|unethical]]. They were often performed illegally, without the knowledge, [[consent]], or [[informed consent]] of the test subjects. Public outcry over the discovery of government experiments on human subjects led to numerous congressional investigations and hearings, including the [[Church Committee]], [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]], and [[Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments]], amongst others. The [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]], widely regarded as the "most infamous biomedical research study in U.S. history,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Katz RV, Kegeles SS, Kressin NR, Green BL, Wang MQ, James SA, Russell SL, Claudio C | title = The Tuskegee Legacy Project: willingness of minorities to participate in biomedical research | journal = Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 698–715 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17242525 | pmc = 1780164 | doi = 10.1353/hpu.2006.0126 | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/resolve_openurl.cgi?issn=1049-2089&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=698&amp;aulast=Katz }}&lt;/ref&gt; was performed from 1932 to 1972 by the [[Tuskegee Institute]] contracted by the [[United States Public Health Service]]. The study followed more than 600 African-American men who were not told they had syphilis and were denied access to the known treatment of [[penicillin]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Fred D. ''The Tuskegee Syphilis Study'', Montgomery: New South Books, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the 1974 [[National Research Act]], to provide for protection of human subjects in experiments. The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research was established and was tasked with establishing the boundary between research and routine practice, the role of [[risk-benefit analysis]], guidelines for participation, and the definition of informed consent. Its ''[[Belmont Report]]'' established three tenets of ethical research: respect for persons, [[beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]], and justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://videocast.nih.gov/pdf/ohrp_belmont_report.pdf | format = pdf | author = [[National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research]] | date = 1978-09-30 | title = The Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research | publisher = [[United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s-60s, [[Chester M. Southam]], an important virologist and cancer researcher, injected [[HeLa]] cells into cancer patients, healthy individuals, and prison inmates from the [[Ohio Penitentiary]]. He wanted to observe if cancer could be transmitted as well as if people could become immune to cancer by developing an acquired immune response. Many believe that this experiment violated the bioethical principles of [[informed consent]], [[primum non nocere|non-maleficence]], and [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skloot|first=Rebecca | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks|date=2010|publisher=Broadway Paperbacks|location=New York|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17511">'''Jambhala''' (also known as Dzambhala, Dzambala, Zambala or Jambala) is the God of Wealth and appropriately a member of the Jewel Family (see [[Ratnasambhava]]). In [[Hindu mythology]], Jambhala is known as [[Kubera]]. Jambhala is also believed to be an emanation of [[Avalokitesvara]] or [[Chenrezig]], the [[Bodhisattva]] of Compassion. There are five different wealth Jambhalas; each has his own practice and [[mantra]] to help eliminate poverty and create financial stability.&lt;ref name="nepal"&gt;Nepalese and Tibetan Arts Blog. Access date= June 3rd, 2013. [http://mydzi.blogspot.com/2008/04/five-jambala-dzambhala-and-mantra.html Five Jambala (Dzambhala) and Mantra].&lt;/ref&gt;

Gyalten Sogdzin Rinpoche said that Jambhala is the protector of all [[Lineage (Buddhism)|Lineages]] and of all sentient beings from all sickness and difficulties. Jambhala is a Bodhisattva of material and spiritual wealth as well as many other things, especially of granting financial stability.
:”''Because in this world, there are all kinds of wrathful and negative emotions or bad spirits, and sometimes they will harm you and other sentient beings, Dzambhala must take on such a wrathful and powerful form to protect us from these harmful spirits and negative karma. Especially, Dzambhala helps us minimize or decrease all misfortunes and obstacles and helps us increase all good fortune and happiness''.”&lt;ref name="gyalten"&gt;His Holiness Gyalten Sogdzin Rinpoche.

The Teachings for the Dzambhala Enpowerment.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
“'''Dzam'''” means “''Deity or gathering''”. “'''Bhah'''” means “''gold or wealth''”. “'''La'''” means “''to honor''”. “'''Dzambhala'''” means “''Precious Golden Deity, who gathers or brings the wealth of spirituality or Dharma and material security or accomplishment to our lives''”.&lt;ref name="gyalten"/&gt;

==The five Jambhalas==
The five Jambhalas are the manifestations of the compassion of [[Buddha]] and Bodhisattvas to guide sentient beings along the path to enlightenment. They have the essence of generosity and represent the activities of increasing benefit. Their aspirations are to help the poor and those suffering from ill-fortune.&lt;ref name="gaden"&gt;Gaden Shartse Dro-Phen Ling (甘丹东顶渡悲林). Access date= June 3rd, 2013.

===Green Jambhala===
{{see also|Akshobhya}}

'''Green Jambhala''' is the chief of the five Jambhalas and is the manifestation of [[Akshobhya|Buddha Akshobhya]], depicted standing upon a corpse and holding a mongoose in his left hand and a [[Kapala]] in his right hand.&lt;ref name="nepal"/&gt;

He is usually shown with his consort and carrying a jewel producing mongoose in his left hand.&lt;ref name="red"&gt;Red Zambala. February 14th, 2013. Access date= June 3rd, 2013. [http://redzambala.com/buddhism/buddha-aspects/who-is-red-zambala-in-buddhism.html Red Zambala].&lt;/ref&gt; Green Jambhala has bluish green colored body. He sits in the ''vajra'' position with [[Dakini]] in front of him. His right leg is panhandle with right foot is above a snail and lotus flower, while his left leg is kinked. On his left hand is an animal called Nehulay ([[mongoose]]) which spue out jewels from its mouth, his right hand holding ''[[Citron|Norbu]]''. The [[Dakini]] holding lotus flower in her hand. The Mantra of Green Jambhala is:&lt;ref name="tharpa"/&gt;
:'''''Om Karma Jambhala Ah Svaha'''''

===White Jambhala===
{{see also|Chenrezig|Avalokiteśvara}}
'''White Jambhala''' (or '''''Dzambhala Gapee''''' in Tibetan) is the compassionate manifestation of the [[Chenrezig|Bodhisattva Chenrezig]] ([[Guan Yin]]). He can remove the suffering of poverty and sickness, purify non-virtuous [[karma]] and karmic obstacles, avert disaster and sickness, and evolve [[bodhicitta]] mind.&lt;ref name="nepal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gaden"/&gt;

The Tibetan legend said that a revered high lama, [[Atisha]], was walking alone when he found a man starving and near death. After looking around and unable to find food for the old man, he cut flesh from his own body and offered it to the starving man. But the man refused to eat of his flesh. Being depressed and not knowing how else to help the man nearing death, Lama Atisha sat down next to him. At that point there was a blinding bright white light and before Atisha appeared [[Chenrezig]] of Compassion. He told Lama Atisha that he was going to manifest himself as the God of Wealth, Jambhala, and assure that those in poverty would suffer no longer.&lt;ref name="john"&gt;John W. Sheridan. June 29th, 2011. Access date= June 3rd, 2013. [http://tantramantras.blogspot.com/2011/06/five-jambhala-wealth-gods.html The Five Jambhala Wealth Gods].&lt;/ref&gt;

As the manifestation of [[Avalokitesvara|Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva]], White Jambhala was born from his right eye. He sits on a [[snow lion]], although some artists depict him sitting on a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]], and a [[mongoose]] in his left hand spits out precious diamonds and ornaments.&lt;ref name="nepal"/&gt; White Jambhala has white colored body. He also holding a Wealth Banner in his left arm and a gold sword in his right. The Mantra of White Jambhala is:&lt;ref name="tharpa"/&gt;
:'''''Om Padma Krodha Arya Jambhala Hridaya Hum Phat'''''

When cultivating the "''Dragon-ridding White Jambhala Practice''", the practitioners can also pray that he will lead them to hidden treasures. In the olden days, Tibetan Tantric masters placed their precious teachings in caves. These teachings were sealed in the four elements of "earth, water, fire and wind". One needs to employ very special methods to retrieve these Dharma treasures. One must also know the location of the caves where these ancestry masters had practiced in seclusion. The practitioners may pray to the "Dragon-ridding White Jambhala" so that he will bring them to these caves where the treasures were hidden.&lt;ref name="tbs"/&gt;

===Yellow Jambhala===

In ancient times, this deity was practiced mainly by kings and royalty. His practice is most suitable to people in high power, or to pray for high power, for it can attract people, wealth and fame. One will enjoy wealth in abundance and shall be well respected and supported by people.&lt;ref name="gaden"/&gt; There is also the Red Jambhala magnetizing method that can bless the practitioner with marital bliss and a harmonious family.&lt;ref name="tbs"/&gt;

According to legend, Red Jambhala was in charge of the heavenly treasury that belonged to Lord [[Mahesvara]]’s son. Due to his extreme compassion, Red Jambhala had unfailingly answered the prayers of many worshippers. Enraged by Red Jambhala’s indiscriminate charity to both the good and evil, [[Dhammapala|Dharma guardian]] [[Mahakala]] decapitated him. It was only after the wealth deity repents that Mahakala plants an elephant’s head on his neck and receives him as a retainer.&lt;ref name="tbs"/&gt;

===Black Jambhala===
{{see also|Kubera|Amoghasiddhi}}

The '''Black Jambhala''' is also known as the Hindu God of Wealth, [[Kubera]].&lt;ref name="john"/&gt; Originated in ancient [[India]], he manifested from the waters of the river and gave the transmission of generating wealth to a king whose kingdom was undergoing extreme financial difficulties during that time. He also benefits the poor and those in solitary retreat that have a virtuous mind.&lt;ref name="gaden"/&gt;

Popularized by Shakyasribhadra, holding a skullcup and mongoose, naked and wrathful in a standing posture. He is the God of Wealth in Tibetan buddhism. With august guise he treads on the back of yellow rich man. Jambhala, Black (Tibetan: dzam bha la, nag po), a wealth deity popularized in Tibet by Bari Lotsawa (b.1040) and the Kashmiri teacher [[Shakyashri]] Bhadra.

" ... the Lord Jambhala, with a body black in colour, having the appearance of a dwarf, naked, sexually aroused, pot-bellied, with pierced ears, three bulging bloodshot eyes, brown hair flowing upwards and bared fangs, in a standing position, the right leg bent, and the left straight. He has one head and two arms. The right hand holds the top of a skull in front of his chest as a blood container, and the left hand holds a mongoose expelling wish fulfilling jewels. On his head is a crown of five skulls in the shape of the five-Buddha crown; around his neck is a string of 50 pray beads made of human skulls, with five-color snakes as bracelets on hands, feet and neck. He shows anger on his face, standing with his right leg bent, his left leg extended, the right leg is extended pressing upon the head of the yellow Lord of Wealth, adorned with various gold ornaments, lying face down beneath Black Jambhala's feet." (Ngorchen Konchog Lhundrup, 1497-1557).

He is the manifestation of [[Amoghasiddhi|Amoghasiddhi Buddha]] by the request of [[Shakyamuni|Buddha Shakyamuni]] to turn the [[wheel of Dharma]] to benefit sentient beings who are suffering from poverty. He will enable all endeavors to be perfectly accomplished and purify all bad luck and obstacles, prevent theft, bad debts and loss of wealth.&lt;ref name="gaden"/&gt; Jambhala has a black colored body. He is depicted in a standing position over a human body, symbolizes to subdue human’s ego and eliminate human’s greed. His right hand holding Gems Pot and his left hand holding an animal named Nehulay ([[mongoose]]) which spue out jewels from its mouth. Black Jambhala also wears a snake necklace on his body. The Mantra of Black Jambhala is:&lt;ref name="tharpa"/&gt;
:'''''Om Jambhala Jalendraye Bashu Dharini Svaha''''' and
:""Om Indzali Mu Kam Dzamali Soha""

==The practice==
In [[Tantric Buddhism|Tantrism]], Jambhala practice is an expedient and worldly cultivation-method. Tantric cultivation is divided into “Generation Stage” and “Completion Stage”; ''Generation Stage'' is the foundation while ''Completion Stage'' consists of practices pertaining to the holy truth and the transcendental methods. Jambhala practice is a fundamental cultivation-method.&lt;ref name="tbs"&gt;Singapore True Buddha School Yuan Xi Tang. Access date= April 3rd, 2013. [http://www.padmakumara.org/oldtbsn/teach/jambhala.htm The Jambhala Practice of Tantric Buddhism].&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of five Jambhalas practices is [[Bodhicitta]]. Practitioners should generate the altruistic ''intention of compassion'' ([[Bodhicitta]]), and practice generosity. The practice can remove poverty within the [[six realms]] and increase one’s merits, wisdom and lifespan. All their material and spiritual needs will be met.&lt;ref name="gaden"/&gt;

The [[Puja (Buddhism)|puja]] of five Jambhalas summons immense positive wealth energies upon the participants. The [[Buddhist]]s believe that wealth results from one’s past actions, but this puja itself also plays a significant role in changing the course of one’s financial situation. Gaden Shartse said:&lt;ref name="gaden"/&gt;
: “''With a sincere motivation to accumulate merit, purify our negative karma, as well as make prayers for all sentient beings to be freed from all poverty and all sufferings, without doubt - one will certainly receive the vast blessings and protection of the wealth deities''.”

Some people claim that cultivating the Jambhala practice will increase one’s greed. Although the spiritual practitioner has the desire to gain great fortune, his body, mind and speech are nonetheless gradually purified in the process of practicing the Tantric method.&lt;ref name="tbs"/&gt;

===Reciting mantras===
Chanting the mantra of every Jambhala is believed to be more beneficial if the chanter has received oral transmissions from a teacher who holds the teaching [[Lineage (Buddhism)|Lineage]].&lt;ref name="tharpa"/&gt;

===Pouring water over statues===
The legend said that while [[Sakyamuni|Sakyamuni Buddha]] was teaching the [[Prajnaparamita Hridaya Sutra|Maha Prajna-Paramita Sutra]], the jealous Devadatta threw rocks at the [[Buddha]]. But instead, the rocks hit White and Yellow Jambhalas on their heads and hit Black Jambhala on the stomach.&lt;ref name="nepal"/&gt; Buddha then came over to Jambhala and blessed him; from his hand came a white, nectar-like substance of wisdom and compassion and love, and touched Jambhala’s head. Jambhala felt very blissful, happy, calm, and cleaned his impurities and obstructions, and his wounds. Jambhala immediately bowed down to Buddha and thanked him.&lt;ref name="red"/&gt;

[[Sakyamuni|Sakyamuni Buddha]] said to him, “As I have healed you and I poured this holy nectar onto you, in the future any one of my students or student’s students who invokes your power and pours water onto your head - bestow on them wealth, give them the two types of wealth, material wealth and spiritual wealth, more importantly spiritual wealth.” After that, Jambhala folded his hands and said, “I will do as you have said and I promise that I will do that.”&lt;ref name="red"/&gt;

That story has become the basis for the practitioners of ''Jambhala Puja'' to pour water over their statues or to place their statues under the falling water of six-step waterfalls.&lt;ref name="nepal"/&gt;

'''Karel Slavoj Amerling''' (September 18, 1807 – November 2, 1884; also known as '''Karl Slavomil Amerling'''; pen name '''Slavoj Strnad Klatovský''') was a [[Czech people|Czech]] teacher, writer, and philosopher.&lt;ref name= "jergym"&gt;[http://www.jergym.hiedu.cz/~canovm/objevite/objevite/amerling.htm  {{cs icon}} Karel Slavoj Amerling]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metodika"&gt;[http://www.rvp.cz/clanek/498/825  {{cs icon}} Metodický portál-Karel Slavoj Amerling]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amerling was born in [[Klatovy]], and was the son of a wealthy baker. After he studied philosophy in [[Vienna]], he worked two years as a governor. Then he studied [[Medical education|medicine]] in Prague, but he was also interested in philosophy, theology, [[mineralogy]], and [[biology]]. In 1836 he earned his degree, and went on to become a secretary of Earl A. Šternberk, but had to leave this post due to illness. Later, he became a doctor in Prague.&lt;ref name="jergym" /&gt;

On July 25, 1840 he founded the Budeč institute,&lt;ref name=jergym /&gt; which combined the functions of several institutions. On the ground floor were [[workshop]]s, and [[Laboratory|laboratories]]. The first floor was designed to educate future teachers. The second floor was primarily used for music education, but also had an extensive library with a printing press, which could print many alphabets including [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. There was also a clockmaker workshop, and a stone cutter workshop. An extensive [[natural science]] collection could also be found on this floor. The third floor was a hospital. There was also a tower which served as an [[Observatory|astronomical observatory]], and a [[Weather station|meteorological station]].&lt;ref name="metodika" /&gt;

In 1847 he married Františka Svatava Michalovicová.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyklopedie.brna.cz/home/?acc=profil_osobnosti&amp;load=10|{{cs icon}} Osobnosti-Karel Slavoj Amerling]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848 he became the head of an institute for future educators, but was forced to leave due to political reasons in 1868. In 1870 he became the headmaster of the Prague Institute for Feeble-minded Children, and he remained in this position until he died on November 2, 1884 in [[Prague]].&lt;ref name="jergym" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "metodika" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libri.cz/databaze/kdo18/search.php?zp=9&amp;name=AMERLING+KAREL+SLAVOJ  {{cs icon}} Kdo byl kdo-Karel Slavoj Amerling]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lakshmanananda Saraswati''' (1926 – 23 August 2008), born '''Shravan Krishna Navami''', also known as '''Swami Lakshmanananda''', was a Hindu monk and a highly revered social leader who lived a life dedicated to tribal welfare. The Swami was a native of Gurujanga village in [[Talcher]] and was born into a Brahmin family. Over four decades ago, he left his wife and one-year-old son to become a monk, and moved to Rishikesh in the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orissatimes.net/2008/08/swami-laxmanananda-saraswati-man-with.html Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati, A Man with a Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901014445/http://www.orissatimes.net/2008/08/swami-laxmanananda-saraswati-man-with.html |date= 1 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, he established an ashram at Chakapada in [[Kandhamal district]] of [[Odisha]]. Since 1970 he had been involved in social services promoting tribal welfare. He was regarded as a messiah among Hindu tribals of the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeenews.india.com/news/odisha/saraswati-was-messiah-for-tribal-hindus-in-kandhamal_569048.html 'Saraswati was messiah for tribal Hindus in Kandhamal'] Zee News - 7 October 2009&lt;!--dead link replaced by another link--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attacks ==
His work for the upliftment of isolated tribal populations and opposition to aggressive proselytizing and missionary activities, had run afoul of several groups as well as Maoist groups. He was severely injured in an attack by a mob in 2007.&lt;ref name="newstoday"&gt;[http://www.newstodaynet.com/printer.php?id=3557 Attack on Laxmanananda by Christian mob in Orissa] V Sundaram - Fri, 28 Dec 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010004351/http://www.newstodaynet.com/printer.php?id=3557 |date=10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saraswati accused the Congress Member of Parliament and the chief of the missionary organisation, World Vision, Radhakant Nayak, of complicity in the attack on him. He also alleged that there was a nexus between Maoist terrorists and missionaries. The swami also said that [[World Vision]] spent money in India for [[proselytization]], including during the aftermath of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]].&lt;ref name="newstoday"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/61677/RSS-wing-blames-Cong-MP-for-triggering-communal-tension-in-Kandhamal.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616172149/http://www.dailypioneer.com/61677/RSS-wing-blames-Cong-MP-for-triggering-communal-tension-in-Kandhamal.html |archivedate=2011-06-16 |title=RSS wing blames Cong MP for triggering communal tension in Kandhamal |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Assam-cadre IPS officer (retired) from Odisha, Ashok Sahu, after visiting the [[Kandhamal]] district, alleged that an NGO, [[World Vision]], patronised by [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] [[Rajya Sabha]] member Radhakanta Nayak, had a role in the attack on Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati on 24 December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailypioneer.com/13972/Ex-IPS-officer-blames-Maoists-churches.html Ex IPS Officer Blames Maoists, Churches]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swami's claim that he had been attacked eight times before 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/Swami+Laxmananand+feared+for+his+life:+NGO/1/14653.html|title=Swami Laxmananand feared for his life: NGO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was corroborated in January 2008 by a fact-finding commission, chaired by Additional Advocate General of [[Rajasthan]] G.S. Gill. The first attack on the Swami occurred on 26 December 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailypioneer.com/6160/Anti-reconversion-lobby-killed-Laxmananand-NGO.html Anti-reconversion lobby killed Laxmananand: NGO] The Pioneer - 6 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assassination ==
{{main|Murder of Swami Lakshmanananda}}

He was assassinated on 23 August 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=SASWAT PANIGRAHI|title=Swami Lakshmanananda murder: Six years gone, inquiry on, no justice|url=http://www.niticentral.com/2014/08/23/swami-lakshmanananda-murder-six-years-gone-inquiry-on-no-justice-236448.html|accessdate=28 February 2015|work=Niti Central|date=23 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160728/http://www.niticentral.com/2014/08/23/swami-lakshmanananda-murder-six-years-gone-inquiry-on-no-justice-236448.html|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with four disciples at his kanyashram (girls school) at [[Tumudibandha]], about 100&amp;nbsp;km from Phulbani, the district headquarters of Kandhmal district, on the sacred day of [[Janmashtami]]. A group of 30-40 armed men surrounded the ashram. Four of the assailants carried AK-47s and many others had locally made revolvers. Two of the four government-provided security guards had gone home to eat. The assailants tied and gagged the two remaining guards. Within minutes of reaching the crime scene, the district authorities made a statement saying it was suspected Maoists who killed the Swami. The Maoist leader Sabyasachi Panda told the private [[Oriya language|Oriya]] channels at an undisclosed location that the Maoists decided to eliminate Saraswati as he was 'spreading social unrest' in the tribal-dominated district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/oct/05orissa.htm|title=We killed Swami Laxmananda: Maoist leader|website=www.rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some disagree that [[Maoists]] or left-wing extremists could be behind the assassination of the monk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/aug/28orissa1.htm|title=Who killed Swami Lakshmanananda?|website=www.rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expressbuzz.com/States/Orissa/security-for-swami-was-not-adequate-sp/115663.html|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120511223917/http://expressbuzz.com/States/Orissa/security-for-swami-was-not-adequate-sp/115663.html|deadurl=yes|title=Security for Swami was not adequate: SP - Lakshmanananda Saraswati - …|date=11 May 2012|archivedate=11 May 2012|website=archive.is}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of people had gathered en route to pay their last respects to Lakshmanananda. They ended up engaging in civil unrest, rioting, looting and attacked places of worship, mostly churches and Christian properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2519/stories/20080926251900400.htm|title=Sangh Parivar’s Orissa Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==

[[File:Lincoln Philosophy Café 3rd Anniversary Meeting on 4th June 2012.JPG|thumb|LPC’s 3rd Anniversary Meeting]]The Lincoln Philosophy Café is a not-for-profit organisation and membership is completely free of charge&lt;ref&gt;"One of the main ideas behind the Philosophy Café concept is that it is free of charge and open to everyone." - http://philosophycafe.co.uk/free-open-to-all/&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure that it is accessible to all. Registered with the [[Society for Philosophical Inquiry]], the Lincoln Philosophy Café bases its core ideal around the concept of informal discussion in a relaxed environment. For example, members are encouraged to not argue with each other but rather to engage in debate of which there is no right nor wrong.&lt;ref&gt;"an atmosphere of antagonism is not encouraged" - James Taylor-Foster, Lincolnshire Echo (16/12/2010) - http://lincolnphilosophycafe.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/lpc-lincs-echo-wo-1612-2010.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of each monthly or fortnightly meeting has been radically changed since its formation.&lt;ref&gt;Current structure - http://philosophycafe.co.uk/structure/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==

Its foundation was inspired by the work of [[Marc Sautet]] at the Parisian [[Café Philosophique]] (at the Café des Phares&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophycafe.co.uk/LPC/Photos/Pages/Visits.html Café des Phares]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Place de la Bastille]]). The idea of "a return to the basic principles of reasoning intended for the general public" is at the core of the structure of the Lincoln Philosophy Café, with anyone from anywhere welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;‘Free and open to all’ - http://philosophycafe.co.uk/free-open-to-all/&lt;/ref&gt; A diluted and uniquely evolved version of the [[Socratic method|Socratic Method]] is encouraged to stimulate people to challenge others opinions informally and politely without causing argument.

In [[personality psychology]], '''locus of control''' is the degree to which people believe that they have control over the outcome of events in their lives, as opposed to external forces beyond their control. Understanding of the concept was developed by [[Julian Rotter|Julian B. Rotter]] in 1954, and has since become an aspect of personality studies. A person's "loci" (plural of "locus", Latin for "place" or "location") are conceptualized as internal (a belief that one's life can be controlled) or external (a belief that life is controlled by outside factors which they cannot influence, or that chance or fate controls their lives).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0092976 |title=Generalized expectancies for internal versus external control of reinforcement |journal=Psychological Monographs: General and Applied |volume=80 |pages=1–28 |year=1966 |last1=Rotter |first1=Julian B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with a strong internal locus of control believe events in their life derive primarily from their own actions: for example, when receiving exam results, people with an internal locus of control tend to praise or blame themselves and their abilities.  People with a strong external locus of control tend to praise or blame external factors such as the teacher or the exam.&lt;ref name="Carlson, N.R. 2007"&gt;Carlson, N.R., et al. (2007).

{{anchor|Summary, critique and the future}}
Locus of control generated much research in a variety of areas in psychology. The construct is applicable to such fields as [[educational psychology]], [[health psychology]] and [[clinical psychology]]. Debate continues whether specific or more global measures of locus of control will prove to be more useful in practical application. Careful distinctions should also be made between locus of control (a concept linked with expectancies about the future) and attributional style (a concept linked with explanations for past outcomes), or between locus of control and concepts such as [[self-efficacy]].

Locus of control is one of the four dimensions of [[core self-evaluations]] – one's fundamental appraisal of oneself – along with [[neuroticism]], [[self-efficacy]], and [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name=Judge1997&gt;{{cite journal |last=Judge |first=T.

C. |year=1997 |title=The dispositional causes of job satisfaction: A core evaluations approach |journal=Research in Organizational Behavior |volume=19 |issue= |pages=151–188 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of core self-evaluations was first examined by Judge, Locke, and Durham (1997), and since has proven to have the ability to predict several work outcomes, specifically, job satisfaction and [[job performance]].&lt;ref name="dorman2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dormann |first=C. |last2=Fay |first2=D. |last3=Zapf |first3=D. |last4=Frese |first4=M. |year=2006 |title=A state-trait analysis of job satisfaction: On the effect of core self-evaluations |journal=Applied Psychology: An International Review |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=27–51 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-0597.2006.00227.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow-up study, Judge et al. (2002) argued that locus of control, neuroticism, self-efficacy and self-esteem factors may have a common core.&lt;ref name=pmid12219863&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.3.693 |pmid=12219863 |title=Are measures of self-esteem, neuroticism, locus of control, and generalized self-efficacy indicators of a common core construct? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=693–710 |year=2002 |last1=Judge |first1=Timothy A |last2=Erez |first2=Amir |last3=Bono |first3=Joyce E |last4=Thoresen |first4=Carl J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|History of concept}}History==

Locus of control is the framework of Rotter's (1954) social-learning theory of personality. In 1966 he published an article in ''Psychological Monographs'' which summarized over a decade of research (by Rotter and his students), much of it previously unpublished. In 1976, Herbert M. Lefcourt defined the perceived locus of control: "...a generalised expectancy for internal as opposed to external control of reinforcements".&lt;ref&gt;Lefcourt 1976, p.&amp;nbsp;27{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts have been made to trace the genesis of the concept to the work of [[Alfred Adler]], but its immediate background lies in the work of Rotter and his students. Early work on the topic of expectations about control of reinforcement had been performed in the 1950s by James and Phares (prepared for unpublished doctoral dissertations supervised by Rotter at [[The Ohio State University]]).&lt;ref name=Lefcourt&gt;Herbert M. Lefcourt, ''Locus of Control: Current Trends in Thory and Research''. Psychology Press, 1982{{pn|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Rotter student, William H. James studied two types of "expectancy shifts":
* ''Typical expectancy shifts'', believing that success (or failure) would be followed by a similar outcome
* ''Atypical expectancy shifts'', believing that success (or failure) would be followed by a dissimilar outcome

Additional research led to the hypothesis that typical expectancy shifts were displayed more often by those who attributed their outcomes to ability, whereas those who displayed atypical expectancy were more likely to attribute their outcomes to chance. This was interpreted that people could be divided into those who attribute to ability (an internal cause) versus those who attribute to luck (an external cause). [[Bernard Weiner]] argued that rather than ability-versus-luck, locus may relate to whether attributions are made to stable or unstable causes.

Rotter (1975, 1989) has discussed problems and misconceptions in others' use of the internal-versus-external construct.

=={{anchor|Locus of control personality orientations}}Personality orientation==
Rotter (1975) cautioned that internality and externality represent two ends of a continuum, not an either/or typology. ''Internals'' tend to attribute outcomes of events to their own control. People who have internal locus of control believe that the outcomes of their actions are results of their own abilities. Internals believe that their hard work would lead them to obtain positive outcomes.&lt;ref name="JL reff 2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5539/res.v4n2p124 |title=Impact of Locus of Control Expectancy on Level of Well-Being |journal=Review of European Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |year=2012 |last1=April |first1=Kurt A |last2=Dharani |first2=Babar |last3=Peters |first3=Kai }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also believe that every action has its consequence, which makes them accept the fact that things happen and it depends on them if they want to have control over it or not. ''Externals'' attribute outcomes of events to external circumstances. People with an external locus of control tend to believe that the things which happen in their lives are out of their control,&lt;ref name="JL reff 1"/&gt; and even that their own actions are a result of external factors, such as fate, luck, the influence of powerful others (such as doctors, the police, or government officials) and/or a belief that the world is too complex for one to predict or successfully control its outcomes. Such people tend to blame others rather than themselves for their lives' outcomes. It should not be thought, however, that internality is linked exclusively with attribution to effort and externality with attribution to luck (as Weiner's work – see below –  makes clear). This has obvious implications for differences between internals and externals in terms of their achievement motivation, suggesting that internal locus is linked with higher levels of [[need for achievement]]. Due to their locating control outside themselves, externals tend to feel they have less control over their fate. People with an external locus of control tend to be more stressed and prone to [[clinical depression]].&lt;ref name=pmid3057032&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0021-843x.97.3.357 |title=Is there a relation between locus of control orientation and depression? |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=357–367 |year=1988 |last1=Benassi |first1=Victor A |last2=Sweeney |first2=Paul D |last3=Dufour |first3=Charles L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internals were believed by Rotter (1966) to exhibit two essential characteristics: high achievement motivation and low outer-directedness. This was the basis of the locus-of-control scale proposed by Rotter in 1966, although it was based on Rotter's belief that locus of control is a single construct. Since 1970, Rotter's assumption of uni-dimensionality has been challenged, with Levenson (for example) arguing that different dimensions of locus of control (such as beliefs that events in one's life are self-determined, or organized by powerful others and are chance-based) must be separated. Weiner's early work in the 1970s suggested that [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] to the internality-externality dimension, differences should be considered between those who attribute to stable and those who attribute to unstable causes.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

This new, dimensional theory meant that one could now attribute outcomes to ability (an internal stable cause), effort (an internal unstable cause), task difficulty (an external stable cause) or luck (an external, unstable cause). Although this was how Weiner originally saw these four causes, he has been challenged as to whether people see luck (for example) as an external cause, whether ability is always perceived as stable, and whether effort is always seen as changing. Indeed, in more recent publications (e.g. Weiner, 1980) he uses different terms for these four causes (such as "objective task characteristics" instead of "task difficulty" and "chance" instead of "luck"). Psychologists since Weiner have distinguished between stable and unstable effort, knowing that in some circumstances effort could be seen as a stable cause (especially given the presence of words such as "industrious" in English).

Regarding locus of control, there is another type of control that entails a mix among the internal and external types. People that have the combination of the two types of locus of control are often referred to as Bi-locals. People that have Bi-local characteristics are known to handle stress and cope with their diseases more efficiently by having the mixture of internal and external locus of control.&lt;ref name="JL reff 1"/&gt; People that have this mix of loci of control can take personal responsibility for their actions and the consequences thereof while remaining capable of relying upon and having faith in outside resources; these characteristics correspond to the internal and external loci of control, respectively. An example of this mixed system would be an alcoholic who will accept the fact that he brought the disease upon himself while remaining open to treatment and/or acknowledging that there are people, mainly doctors and therapists, that are trying to cure his/her addiction, and on whom he should rely.

=={{anchor|Scales to measure locus of control}}Measuring scales==
The most widely used questionnaire to measure locus of control is the 23-item (plus six filler items), [http://www.psych.uncc.edu/pagoolka/LC.html forced-choice scale] of Rotter (1966). However, this is not the only questionnaire; Bialer's (1961) 23-item scale for children predates Rotter's work. Also relevant to the locus-of-control scale are the Crandall Intellectual Ascription of Responsibility Scale (Crandall, 1965) and the Nowicki-Strickland Scale.&lt;ref&gt;Nowicki and Strickland, 1971{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest psychometric scales to assess locus of control (using a [[Likert scale|Likert]]-type scale, in contrast to the forced-choice alternative measure in Rotter's scale) was that devised by W. H. James for his unpublished doctoral dissertation, supervised by Rotter at Ohio State University; however, this remains unpublished.&lt;ref name= autogenerated1&gt;Lefcourt, 1976{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many measures of locus of control have appeared since Rotter's scale. These were reviewed by Furnham and Steele (1993) and include those related to [[health psychology]], [[industrial and organizational psychology]] and those specifically for children (such as the Stanford Preschool Internal-External Control Index&lt;ref&gt;Mischel et al., 1974{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furnham &amp; Steele, 1993{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for three- to six-year-olds). Furnham and Steele (1993) cite data suggesting that the most reliable, valid questionnaire for adults is the Duttweiler scale. For a review of the health questionnaires cited by these authors, see "Applications" below.

The Duttweiler (1984) Internal Control Index (ICI) addresses perceived  problems with the Rotter scales, including their forced-choice format, susceptibility to [[social desirability]] and heterogeneity (as indicated by  [[factor analysis]]). She also notes that, while other scales existed in 1984 to measure locus of control, "they appear to be subject to many of the same problems".&lt;ref&gt;Duttweiler 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;211&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the forced-choice format used on Rotter's scale, Duttweiler's 28-item ICI uses a Likert-type scale in which people must state whether they would rarely, occasionally, sometimes, frequently or usually behave as specified in each of 28 statements. The ICI assess variables pertinent to internal locus: cognitive processing, autonomy, resistance to social influence, self-confidence and delay of [[gratification]]. A small (133 student-subject) validation study indicated that the scale had good internal reliability (a [[Cronbach's alpha]] of 0.85).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salmani Nodoushan |first1=M. A. |year=2012 |title=The impact of locus of control on language achievement |journal=International Journal of Language Studies |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=123–36 |url=https://works.bepress.com/nodushan/125/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Related area: attributional style}}Attributional style==
{{Main|Explanatory style}}
Attributional style (or explanatory style) is a concept introduced by [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson]], [[Martin Seligman]] and [[John D. Teasdale]].&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Seligman and Teasdale, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept advances a stage further than Weiner, stating that in addition to the concepts of internality-externality and stability a dimension of globality-specificity is also needed. Abramson et al. believed that how people explained successes and failures in their lives related to whether they attributed these to internal or external factors, short-term or long-term factors, and factors that affected all situations.

The topic of [[attribution theory]] (introduced to psychology by [[Fritz Heider]]) has had an influence on locus of control theory, but there are important historical differences between the two models. Attribution theorists have been predominantly [[Social psychology|social psychologists]], concerned with the general processes characterizing how and why people make the attributions they do, whereas locus of control theorists have been concerned with individual differences.

Significant to the history of both approaches are the contributions made by [[Bernard Weiner]] in the 1970s. Before this time, attribution theorists and locus of control theorists had been largely concerned with divisions into external and internal loci of causality. Weiner added the dimension of stability-instability (and later controllability), indicating how a cause could be perceived as having been internal to a person yet still beyond the person's control. The stability dimension added to the understanding of why people succeed or fail after such outcomes. Although not part of Weiner's model, a further dimension of attribution, that of globality-specificity, was added by Abramson, Seligman and Teasdale.

=={{anchor|Applications of locus of control theory}}Applications==
Locus of control's best known application may have been in the area of [[health psychology]], largely due to the work of Kenneth Wallston. Scales to measure locus of control in the health domain were reviewed by Furnham and Steele  in 1993. The best-known are the Health Locus of Control Scale and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, or MHLC.&lt;ref&gt;Wallston, Wallston, &amp; DeVellis, 1976; Wallston, Wallston, Kaplan &amp; Maides, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The latter scale is based on the idea (echoing Levenson's earlier work) that health may be attributed to three sources: internal factors (such as self-determination of a healthy lifestyle), powerful others (such as one's doctor) or luck (which is very dangerous as lifestyle advice will be ignored – these people are very difficult to help).

Some of the scales reviewed by Furnham and Steele (1993) relate to health in more specific domains, such as [[obesity]] (for example, Saltzer's (1982) Weight Locus of Control Scale or Stotland and Zuroff's (1990) Dieting Beliefs Scale), mental health (such as Wood and Letak's (1982) Mental Health Locus of Control Scale or the Depression Locus of Control Scale of Whiteman, Desmond and Price, 1987) and cancer (the Cancer Locus of Control Scale of Pruyn et al., 1988). In discussing applications of the concept to health psychology Furnham and Steele refer to Claire Bradley's work, linking locus of control to the management of [[diabetes mellitus]]. Empirical data on health locus of control in a number of fields was reviewed by Norman and Bennett in 1995; they note that data on whether certain health-related behaviors are related to internal health locus of control have been ambiguous. They note that some studies found that internal health locus of control is linked with increased exercise, but cite other studies which found a weak (or no) relationship between exercise behaviors (such as [[jogging]]) and internal health locus of control. A similar ambiguity is noted for data on the relationship between internal health locus of control and other health-related behaviors (such as [[breast self-examination]], weight control and preventative-health behavior). Of particular interest are the data cited on the relationship between internal health locus of control and alcohol consumption.

Norman and Bennett note that some studies that compared alcoholics with non-alcoholics suggest [[alcoholism]] is linked to increased externality for health locus of control; however, other studies have linked alcoholism with increased internality. Similar ambiguity has been found in studies of alcohol consumption in the general, non-alcoholic population. They are more optimistic in reviewing the literature on the relationship between internal health locus of control and [[smoking cessation]], although they also point out that there are grounds for supposing that powerful-others and internal-health loci of control may be linked with this behavior. It is thought that, rather than being caused by one or the other, that alcoholism is directly related to the strength of the locus, regardless of type, internal or external.

They argue that a stronger relationship is found when health locus of control is assessed for specific domains than when general measures are taken. Overall, studies using behavior-specific health locus scales have tended to produce more positive results.&lt;ref&gt;Lefcourt, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; These scales have been found to be more predictive of general behavior than more general scales, such as the MHLC scale.&lt;ref&gt;Norman &amp; Bennett, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;72&lt;/ref&gt; Norman and Bennett cite several studies that used health-related locus-of-control scales in specific domains (including smoking cessation),&lt;ref&gt;Georgio &amp; Bradley, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; diabetes,&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, Price, Desmond and Roberts, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; tablet-treated diabetes,&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Lewis, Jennings and Ward, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; hypertension,&lt;ref&gt;Stantion, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; arthritis,&lt;ref&gt;Nicasio ''et al'', 1985&lt;/ref&gt; cancer,&lt;ref&gt;Pruyn ''et al'', 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and heart and lung disease.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

They also argue that health locus of control is better at predicting health-related behavior if studied in conjunction with health value (the value people attach to their health), suggesting that health value is an important [[moderator variable]] in the health locus of control relationship. For example, Weiss and Larsen (1990) found an increased relationship between internal health locus of control and health when health value was assessed.&lt;ref&gt;Norman and Bennett, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the importance Norman and Bennett attach to specific measures of locus of control, there are general textbooks on personality which cite studies linking internal locus of control with improved physical health, mental health and [[quality of life]] in people with diverse conditions: [[HIV]], [[migraines]], [[diabetes]], [[kidney disease]] and [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref&gt;Maltby, Day &amp; Macaskill, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s, Whyte correlated locus of control with the academic success of students enrolled in higher-education courses. Students who were more internally controlled believed that hard work and focus would result in successful academic progress, and they performed better academically. Those students who were identified as more externally controlled (believing that their future depended upon luck or fate) tended to have lower academic-performance levels.  [[Cassandra B. Whyte]] researched how control tendency influenced behavioral outcomes in the academic realm by examining the effects of various modes of counseling on grade improvements and the locus of control of high-risk college students.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, C., "An Integrated Counseling and Learning Assistance Center" (1980). New Directions Sourcebook-Learning Assistance Centers.

Rotter also looked at studies regarding the correlation between gambling and either an internal or external locus of control.  For internals, gambling is more reserved.  When betting, they primarily focus on safe and moderate wagers.  Externals, however, take more chances and, for example, bet more on a card or number that has not appeared for a certain period, under the notion that this card or number has a higher chance of occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hock |first1=Roger R. |year=2013 |contribution=Personality |pages=190–7 |editor1-first=C. |editor1-last=Campanella |editor2-first=J. |editor2-last=Mosher |editor3-first=S. |editor3-last=Frail |editor4-first=M. |editor4-last=Schricker |title=Forty Studies that Changed Psychology |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational psychology and religion===
Other fields to which the concept has been applied include [[industrial and organizational psychology]], [[sports psychology]], [[educational psychology]] and the [[psychology of religion]]. Richard Kahoe has published work in the latter field, suggesting that intrinsic religious orientation correlates positively (and extrinsic religious orientation correlates negatively) with internal locus.&lt;ref&gt;Kahoe, 1974{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of relevance to both health psychology and the psychology of religion is the work of Holt, Clark, Kreuter and Rubio (2003) on a questionnaire to assess spiritual-health locus of control. The authors distinguished between an active spiritual-health locus of control (in which "God empowers the individual to take healthy actions"&lt;ref&gt;Holt et al., p294&lt;/ref&gt;) and a more passive spiritual-health locus of control (where health is left up to God). In [[industrial and organizational psychology]], it has been found that internals are more likely to take positive action to change their jobs (rather than merely talk about occupational change) than externals.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Weeks and Moffat, 2005{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maltby et al., 2007{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer research===
Locus of control has also been applied to the field of consumer research. For example, Martin, Veer and Pervan (2007) examined how the weight locus of control of women (i.e., beliefs about the control of body weight) influence how they react to female models in advertising of different body shapes. They found that women who believe they can control their weight ("internals"), respond most favorably to slim models in advertising, and this favorable response is mediated by self-referencing. In contrast, women who feel powerless about their weight ("externals"), self-reference larger-sized models, but
only prefer larger-sized models when the advertisement is for a non-fattening product. For fattening products, they exhibit a similar preference for larger-sized models and slim models. The weight locus of control measure was also found to be correlated with measures for weight control beliefs and  willpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11002-007-9014-1 |title=Self-referencing and consumer evaluations of larger-sized female models: A weight locus of control perspective |journal=Marketing Letters |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=197–209 |year=2007 |last1=Martin |first1=Brett A. S |last2=Veer |first2=Ekant |last3=Pervan |first3=Simon J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political ideology===
Locus of control has been linked to political ideology. In the 1972 U.S. Presidential election, research of college students found that those with an internal locus of control were substantially more likely to register as a Republican, while those with an external locus of control were substantially more likely to register as a Democrat.&lt;ref name=pmid4814098&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0035997 |title=Locus of control and political participation of college students: A comparison of unidimensional and multidimensional approaches |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=42 |pages=54–58 |year=1974 |last1=Gootnick |first1=Andrew T }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 study surveying students at [[Cameron University]] in Oklahoma found similar results,&lt;ref&gt;Laverghetta, Antonio. "[http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p556976_index.html The Relationship between the Big 5 Personality factors, Locus of Control, and Political Ideology]" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Oklahoma Research Day, Cameron University, Lawton, OK, Nov 04, 2011. 2014-11-25; URL accessed 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; although these studies were limited in scope.

Those with an internal locus of control are more likely to be of higher socioeconomic status, and are more likely to be politically involved (e.g., following political news, joining a political organization)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = A. | last2 = Vigoda | first2 = E. | last3 = Samorly | first3 = A. | year = 2001 | title = Analysis of the mediating effect of personal psychological variables on the relationship between socioeconomic status and political participation: A structural equations framework | url = | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 727–757 | doi=10.1111/0162-895x.00260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with an internal locus of control are also more likely to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanchard | first1 = E. | last2 = Scarboro | first2 = M. | year = 1973 | title = Locus of control and the prediction of voting behavior in college students | url = | journal = Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 89 | issue = 1| pages = 123–129 | doi=10.1080/00224545.1973.9922576| pmid = 4694574 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deutchman | first1 = I | year = 1985 | title = Internal-External Locus of Control, power and political participation | url = | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 57 | issue = 3| pages = 835–843 | doi=10.2466/pr0.1985.57.3.835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Familial origins==
The development of locus of control is associated with family style and resources, cultural stability and experiences with effort leading to reward.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Many internals have grown up with families modeling typical internal beliefs; these families emphasized effort, education, responsibility and thinking, and parents typically gave their children rewards they had promised them. In contrast, externals are typically associated with lower [[socioeconomic status]]. Societies experiencing social unrest increase the expectancy of being out-of-control; therefore, people in such societies become more external.&lt;ref name="Meyerhoff"&gt;Meyerhoff (2004), p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1995 research of Schneewind suggests that "children in large single parent families headed by women are more likely to develop an external locus of control".&lt;ref&gt;Schultz and Schultz (2005), p.439.&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Schultz and Schultz also claim that children in families where parents have been supportive and consistent in discipline develop internal locus of control. At least one study has found that children whose parents had an external locus of control are more likely to attribute their successes and failures to external causes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/66kSA7Ncm?url=http://psych.fullerton.edu/jmearns/rotter.htm "Social Learning Theory of Julian B. Rotter"] Archived from [http://psych.fullerton.edu/jmearns/rotter.htm the original] 2012-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Findings from early studies on the familial origins of locus of control were summarized by Lefcourt: "Warmth, supportiveness and parental encouragement seem to be essential for development of an internal locus".&lt;ref&gt;Lefcourt, 1976, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; However, causal evidence regarding how parental locus of control influences offspring locus of control (whether genetic, or environmentally mediated) is lacking.

Locus of control becomes more internal with age. As children grow older, they gain skills which give them more control over their environment. However, whether this or biological development is responsible for changes in locus is unclear.&lt;ref name="Meyerhoff" /&gt;

=={{anchor|Locus of control and age}}Age==
It is sometimes assumed that as people age they will become less internal and more external, but data here have been ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Aldwin &amp; Gilmer, 2004{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Grant, Plomin, Pedersen, Ahern, Berg &amp; McClearn, 2001{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longitudinal data collected by Gatz and Karel imply that internality may increase until middle age, decreasing thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Karel{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson et al., 2004{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the ambiguity of data in this area, Aldwin and Gilmer (2004) cite Lachman's claim that locus of control is ambiguous. Indeed, there is evidence here that changes in locus of control in later life relate more visibly to increased externality (rather than reduced internality) if the two concepts are taken to be [[orthogonal]]. Evidence cited by Schultz and Schultz (2005) suggests that locus of control increases in internality until middle age. The authors also note that attempts to control the environment become more pronounced between ages eight and fourteen.&lt;ref&gt;Heckhausen and Schulz (1995){{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryckman and Malikosi, 1975{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health locus of control is how people measure and understand how people relate their health to their behavior, health status and how long it may take to recover from a disease.&lt;ref name="JL reff 1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12144-011-9108-z |title=Predictors of Health Locus of Control in Older Adults |journal=Current Psychology |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=173–183 |year=2011 |last1=Jacobs-Lawson |first1=Joy M |last2=Waddell |first2=Erin L |last3=Webb |first3=Alicia K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Locus of control can influence how people think and react towards their health and health decisions. Each day we are exposed to potential diseases that may affect our health. The way we approach that reality has a lot to do with our locus of control. Sometimes it is expected to see older adults experience progressive declines in their health, for this reason it is believed that their health locus of control will be affected.&lt;ref name="JL reff 1"/&gt; However, this does not necessarily mean that their locus of control will be affected negatively but older adults may experience decline in their health and this can show lower levels of internal locus of control.

Age plays an important role in one's internal and external locus of control. When comparing a young child and an older adult with their levels of locus of control in regards to health, the older person will have more control over their attitude and approach to the situation. As people age they become aware of the fact that events outside of their own control happen and that other individuals can have control of their health outcomes.&lt;ref name="JL reff 1"/&gt;

A study published in the journal ''Psychosomatic Medicine'' examined the health effect of childhood locus of control. 7,500 British adults (followed from birth), who had shown an internal locus of control at age 10, were less likely to be overweight at age 30. The children who had an internal locus of control also appeared to have higher levels of self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080619/hl_nm/self_confident_dc | title=Self-confident children may be healthier as adults | website=Yahoo!

=={{anchor|Gender-based differences in locus of control}}Gender-based differences==
As Schultz and Schultz (2005) point out, significant gender differences in locus of control have not been found for adults in the U.S. population. However, these authors also note that there may be specific sex-based differences for specific categories of items to assess locus of control; for example, they cite evidence that men may have a greater internal locus for questions related to academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Strickland &amp; Haley, 1980{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schultz &amp; Schultz, 2005.{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study made by Takaki and colleagues (2006), focused on the gender differences with relationship to internal locus of control and self-efficacy in hemodialysis patients and their compliance.&lt;ref name=pmid16637257&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3200/BMED.32.1.5-11 |pmid=16637257 |title=Possible Gender Differences in the Relationships of Self-efficacy and the Internal Locus of Control with Compliance in Hemodialysis Patients |journal=Behavioral Medicine |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=5–11 |year=2006 |last1=Takaki |first1=Jiro |last2=Yano |first2=Eiji }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study showed that females that had high internal locus of control were less compliant in regards to their health and medical advice compared to the men that participated in this study. Compliance is known to be the degree in which a person's behavior, in this case the patient, has a relationship with the medical advice. For example, a person that is compliant will correctly follow his/her doctor's advice.

=={{anchor|Cross-cultural and Regional issues in locus of control}}Cross-cultural and regional issues==
The question of whether people from different cultures vary in locus of control has long been of interest to social psychologists. Japanese people tend to be more external in locus-of-control orientation than people in the U.S.; however, differences in locus of control between different countries within Europe (and between the U.S. and Europe) tend to be small.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Poortinga, Segall and Dasen, 1992.{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Berry ''et al.'' pointed out in 1992, ethnic groups within the United States have been compared on locus of control; [[African American]]s in the U.S. are more external than [[White American|whites]] when socioeconomic status is controlled.&lt;ref&gt;Dyal, 1984{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berry ''et al.'', 1992.{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berry ''et al.'' also pointed out in 1992 how research on other ethnic minorities in the U.S. (such as Hispanics) has been ambiguous. More on cross-cultural variations in locus of control can be found in Shiraev and Levy (2004). Research in this area indicates that locus of control has been a useful concept for researchers in [[cross-cultural psychology]].

On a less broad scale, Sims and Baumann explained how regions in the United States cope with natural disasters differently.  The example they used was tornados.  They "applied Rotter's theory to explain why more people have died in tornado[e]s in Alabama than in Illinois".&lt;ref&gt;Hock, Roger R. 2013. Personality. P. 195 In: C. Campanella, J. Mosher, S. Frail, M. Schricker (eds.), Forty Studies that Changed Psychology. Pearson Education, Inc. Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;  They explain that after giving surveys to residents of four counties in both Alabama and Illinois, Alabama residents were shown to be more external in their way of thinking about events that occur in their lives.  Illinois residents, however, were more internal.  Because Alabama residents had a more external way of processing information, they took fewer precautions prior to the appearance of a tornado.  Those in Illinois, however, were more prepared, thus leading to fewer casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sims | first1 = J. | last2 = Baumann | first2 = D. | year = 1972 | title = The tornado threat: Coping styles in the North and South | url = | journal = Science | volume = 176 | issue = 4042| pages = 1386–1392 | doi=10.1126/science.176.4042.1386| pmid = 17834637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-efficacy==
{{Further|Self-efficacy}}
Self-efficacy is a person's belief that he or she can accomplish a particular activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gifted.uconn.edu/siegle/SelfEfficacy/section1.html | title=An Introduction to Self-Efficacy | publisher=Neag Center for Creativity, Gifted Education, and Talent Development | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019063232/http://www.gifted.uconn.edu/Siegle/SelfEfficacy/section1.html | archivedate=October 19, 2015 | deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a related concept introduced by [[Albert Bandura]], and has been measured by means of a psychometric scale.&lt;ref&gt;Sherer, Madux et al., 1982&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from locus of control by relating to competence in circumscribed situations and activities (rather than more general cross-situational beliefs about control). Bandura has also emphasised differences between self-efficacy and [[self-esteem]], using examples where low self-efficacy (for instance, in ballroom dancing) are unlikely to result in low self-esteem because competence in that domain is not very important to an individual. Although individuals may have a high internal health locus of control and feel in control of their own health, they may not feel efficacious in performing a specific treatment regimen that is essential to maintaining their own health.&lt;ref name="JL reff 5"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10578-010-0173-6 |pmid=20204497 |title=Locus of Control and Self-Efficacy: Potential Mediators of Stress, Illness, and Utilization of Health Services in College Students |journal=Child Psychiatry &amp; Human Development |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=353–370 |year=2010 |last1=Roddenberry |first1=Angela |last2=Renk |first2=Kimberly }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-efficacy plays an important role in one's health because when people feel that they have self-efficacy over their health conditions, the effects of their health becomes less of a stressor.

Smith (1989) has argued that locus of control only weakly measures self-efficacy; "only a subset of items refer directly to the subject's capabilities".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.&amp;nbsp;229.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith noted that training in coping skills led to increases in self-efficacy, but did not affect locus of control as measured by Rotter's 1966 scale.

== Stress ==
The previous section showed how self-efficacy can be related to a person's locus of control, and stress also has a relationship in these areas. Self-efficacy can be something that people use to deal with the stress that they are faced with in their everyday lives. Some findings suggest that higher levels of external locus of control combined with lower levels self-efficacy are related to higher illness-related psychological distress.&lt;ref name="JL reff 5"/&gt; In the previous section, the different types of locus of control, internal and external, were mentioned. Based on the definition of people who have an external locus of control, we can see that this can be associated with higher levels of stress. A study conducted by Bollini and others reveals that individuals who have a high external locus of control tend to have higher levels of psychological and physical problems. These people are also more vulnerable to external influences and as a result they become more responsive to stress.&lt;ref name="JL reff 5" /&gt;

Veterans of the military forces who have spinal cord injuries and post-traumatic stress are a good group to look at in regards to locus of control and stress. Aging shows to be a very important factor that can be related to the severity of the symptoms of PTSD experienced by patients following the trauma of war.&lt;ref name="JL reff 4"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1521/psyc.2006.69.1.69 |pmid=16704333 |title=Spinal Cord Injury, Posttraumatic Stress, and Locus of Control Among the Elderly: A Comparison with Young and Middle–Aged Patients |journal=Psychiatry: Interpersonal and Biological Processes |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=69–80 |year=2006 |last1=Chung |first1=Man Cheung |last2=Preveza |first2=Eleni |last3=Papandreou |first3=Konstantinos |last4=Prevezas |first4=Nikolaos }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that patients who suffered a spinal cord injury benefit from knowing that they have control over their health problems and their disability, which reflects the characteristics of having internal locus of control.

A study by Chung et al. (2006) focused on how the responses of spinal cord injury post-traumatic stress varied depending on age. The researchers tested different age groups including young adults, middle-aged, and elderly; the average age was 25, 48 and 65 for each group respectively. After the study, they concluded that age does not make a difference on how spinal cord injury patients respond to the traumatic events that happened.&lt;ref name="JL reff 4" /&gt; However, they did mention that age did play a role in the extent to which the external locus of control was used, and concluded that the young adult group demonstrated more external locus of control characteristics than the other age groups to which they were being compared.

'''Niels (Nicolas) [[Treschow (Norwegian family)|Treschow]]''' (5 September 1751 &amp;ndash; 22 September 1833) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[philosopher]], [[educator]] and [[politician]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/Niels_Treschow ''Niels Treschow'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Treschow was born in [[Strømsø]], now part of [[Drammen]] in [[Buskerud]].  He was the son of Peter Treschow (1718-1773) who was a merchant. He took his student examation in 1766 and was awarded a [[Master's Degree]] in [[philosophy]] in 1774. Treschow was rector at the  [[Trondheim Cathedral School]] from 1774-1780 and later served as an educator in [[Oslo]] and [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://nbl.snl.no/Niels_Treschow Terje Bratberg: ''Niels Treschow -Filosof,  Skolemann og  Politiker'' (Norsk biografisk leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a professor at the newly established [[University of Oslo]] in 1813 and as one of initially only five professors was influential in forming the university during its first period. Today, the main building of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Oslo bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uio.no/om/finn-fram/omrader/blindern/bl08/ ''Niels Treschows hus'' (University of Oslo)]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He served as Minister of Education and Church Affairs 1814-1816, 1817-1819, 1820-1822 and 1823-1825, and member of the Council of State Division in [[Stockholm]] 1816-1817, 1819-1820, and 1822-1823. He was elected a member of the [[Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters]] in 1790. In 1825, he was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].   He was decorated with both theCommander's Cross of the [[Order of the North Star]] and the Knight's Cross of [[Order of the Dannebrog]].

'''Paul Alexandre René Janet''' (30 April 1823 – 4 October 1899) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] and writer.

==Biography==
Born in [[Paris, France|Paris]], he became professor of [[moral philosophy]] at [[University of Bourges|Bourges]] (1845–1848) and [[Strasbourg]] (1848–1857), and of logic at the ''lycée Louis-le-Grand'', Paris (1857–1864). In 1864 he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], and elected a member of the academy of moral and political sciences.

He wrote widely on philosophy, politics and ethics, on idealistic lines: ''La Famille'', ''Histoire de la philosophie dans l'antiquité et dans le temps moderne'', ''Histoire de la science politique'', ''Philosophie de la Revolution Française'', etc. However, in the opinion of [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]], these writings are not characterised by much originality of thought. In philosophy he was a follower of [[Victor Cousin]], and through him of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]. His principal work, ''Théorie de la morale'', owes much to [[Immanuel Kant]].

'''Persian mysticism''', or the '''Persian love tradition''', is  a traditional interpretation of existence, life and love in [[Iran]]. It relies on revelatory and heart-felt principles in its reasoning. In fact, Persian [[sufism]] is the practical aspect of Persian mysticism.

==Thought==
Persian mystical thought has been analysed critically by [[Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub]], [[Abdolkarim Soroush]], and [[Dariush Shayegan]]. In [[Al-Ghazali|Ghazzali]], one can witness the fear-based mysticism in its most detailed and eloquent form; in [[Rumi]], one can find love-based mysticism; in [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] the pleasure-based mysticism. Under Rumi's influences, Abdolkarim Soroush is currently working on power-based or epic mysticism.

{{Philosophy sidebar}}
A '''philosopher''' is someone who practices [[Philosophy|philosophy]], which involves [[reason|rational]] inquiry into areas that are outside either [[theology]] or [[science]].&lt;ref name="RussellHistory10"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|author-link=Bertrand Russell|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd|location=Great Britain|page=10|via=Internet Archive|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "philosopher" comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|φιλόσοφος}} (''philosophos'') meaning "lover of wisdom". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker [[Pythagoras]] (6th century BC).&lt;ref name="tufts"&gt;{{LSJ|filo/sofos|φιλόσοφος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Classics|classical]] sense, a philosopher was someone who lived according to a certain way of life, focusing on resolving [[Meaning of life|existential questions]] about the [[human condition]], and not someone who discourses upon theories or comments upon authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''The Inner Citadel''. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, these particular brands of philosophy are [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic]] ones and those who most arduously commit themselves to this lifestyle may be considered philosophers. A philosopher is one who challenges what is thought to be common sense, doesn’t know when to stop asking questions, and reexamines the old ways of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Perry |first= Prof. Ralph Barton |year= 1914 |chapter= Philosophy I: General Introduction: Philosophy and Common Sense |editors= William Allan Neilson, et al.  |title= Lectures on the Harvard Classics |url= https://archive.org/details/harvardclassics51eliouoft |website= Internet Archive |publisher= P. F. Collier &amp; Son Corporation |pages= 126-128 |format= PDF |access-date= 20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a modern sense, a philosopher is an intellectual who has contributed in one or more branches of philosophy, such as [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[social theory]], and [[political philosophy]]. A philosopher may also be one who worked in the [[humanities]] or other sciences which have since split from philosophy proper over the centuries, such as [[the arts]], [[history]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[theology]], and [[politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Shook|editor-first1=John R. |title=Dictionary of Modern American philosophers |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001/acref-9780199754663-miscMatter-0004 |date=2010 |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780199754663 |page=Introduction |doi=10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001 |oclc=686766412 |subscription=yes |quote=The label of "philosopher" has been broadly applied in this Dictionary to intellectuals who have made philosophical contributions regardless of an academic career or professional title. The wide scope of philosophical activity across the timespan of this dictionary would now be classed among the various humanities and social sciences which gradually separated from philosophy over the last one hundred and fifty years. Many figures included were not academic philosophers but did work at the philosophical foundations of such fields as pedagogy, rhetoric, the arts, history, politics, economics, sociology,turtles , psychology, linguistics, anthropology, religion, and theology. Philosophy proper is heavily represented, of course, encompassing the traditional areas of metaphysics, ontology, epistemology, logic, ethics, social/political theory, and aesthetics, along with the narrower fields of philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of law, applied ethics, philosophy of religion, and so forth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Hatnote|This section is about the history of philosophers as an occupation. For a history of philosophy in general, see [[History of philosophy]].}}

===Ancient Greece and Rome===
The separation of philosophy and science from theology began in Greece during the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="RussellHistory11"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|author-link=Bertrand Russell|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd|location=Great Britain|page=11|via=Internet Archive|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thales]], an astronomer and mathematician, was considered by Aristotle to be the first philosopher of the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Pythagoras]] coined the word, the first known elaboration on the topic was conducted by [[Plato]]. In his ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', he concludes that Love is that which lacks the object it seeks. Therefore, the philosopher is one who seeks wisdom; if he attains wisdom, he would be a [[sage (philosophy)|sage]]. Therefore, the philosopher in antiquity was one who lives in the constant pursuit of wisdom, and living in accordance to that wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;That is to say philosophically – [[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 27: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Presentation au College International de Philosophie,' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements arose as to what living philosophically entailed. These disagreements gave rise to different [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic schools of philosophy]]. In consequence, the ancient philosopher thought in a tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 5: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Theologie, exegese, revelation' p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; As the ancient world became schism by philosophical debate, the competition lay in living in manner that would transform his whole way of living in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 30: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, Dictionnaire des philosophes antiques, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the last of these philosophers was [[Marcus Aurelius]], who is widely regarded as a philosopher in the modern sense, but personally refused to call himself by such a title, since he had a duty to live as an [[List of Roman emperors|emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Meditations#THE EIGHTH BOOK]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transition====
According to the [[Classicist]] [[Pierre Hadot]], the modern conception of a philosopher and philosophy developed predominately through three changes:

The first is the natural inclination of the philosophical mind. Philosophy is a tempting discipline which can easily carry away the individual in analyzing the universe and abstract theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 31: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Presentation au College International de Philosophie,' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The second is the historical change through the Medieval era. With the rise of Christianity, the philosophical way of life was adopted by its theology. Thus, philosophy was divided between a way of life and the conceptual, logical, physical and metaphysical materials to justify that way of life. Philosophy was then the servant to theology.&lt;ref name='Hadot32'&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 32: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third is the sociological need with the development of the university. The modern university requires professionals to teach. Maintaining itself requires teaching future professionals to replace the current faculty. Therefore, the discipline degrades into a technical language reserved for specialists, completely eschewing its original conception as a way of life.&lt;ref name='Hadot32'/&gt;

===Medieval era===
In the fourth century, the word philosopher began to designate a man or woman who led a monastic life. [[Gregory of Nyssa]], for example, describes how his sister [[Macrina the Younger|Macrina]] persuaded [[Emmelia of Caesarea|their mother]] to forsake "the distractions of material life" for a life of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;''Readings in World Christian History'' (2013), pp. 147, 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Later during the [[Middle Ages]], persons who engaged with [[alchemy]] was called a philosopher – thus, the [[Philosopher's Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=philosopher&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern era===
{{rquote|right|''Generally speaking, university philosophy is mere fencing in front of a mirror. In the last analysis, its goal is to give students opinions which are to the liking of the minister who hands out the Chairs... As a result, this state-financed philosophy makes a joke of philosophy. And yet, if there is one thing desirable in this world, it is to see a ray of light fall onto the darkness of our lives, shedding some kind of light on the mysterious enigma of our existence.''|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]}}

Many philosophers still emerged from the Classical tradition, as saw their philosophy as a way of life. Among the most notable are [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Nicolas Malebranche]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. With the rise of the university, the modern conception of philosophy became more prominent. Many of the esteemed philosophers of the eighteenth century and onward have attended, taught, and developed their works in university. Early examples include: [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 271: ''Philosophy as a Way of Life''&lt;/ref&gt;

After these individuals, the Classical conception had all but died with the exceptions of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The last considerable figure in philosophy to not have followed a strict and orthodox academic regime was [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Grayling]]. Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern academia===
In the modern era, those attaining advanced degrees in philosophy often choose to stay in careers within the educational system. According to a 1993 study by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (as reported by the [[American Philosophical Association]]), 77.1% of the 7,900 holders of a PhD in philosophy who responded were employed in educational institutions ([[academia]]). Outside academia, philosophers may employ their writing and reasoning skills in other careers, such as medicine{{vague|date=November 2015}}, [[bioethics]], business, publishing, [[free-lance writing]], media, and law.&lt;ref name=APA-nonacademic&gt;{{cite web|author=APA Committee on Non-Academic Careers|title=A non-academic career?|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?page=nonacademic|edition=3rd|date=June 1999|publisher=[[American Philosophical Association]]|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key thinkers===
====French social thought====
Some known [[French people|French]] social thinkers are [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Claude Henri Saint-Simon]], Auguste Comte, and [[Émile Durkheim]].

====British social thought====
[[United Kingdom|British]] social thought, with thinkers such as [[Herbert Spencer]], addressed questions and ideas relating to [[political economy]] and [[social evolution]]. The political ideals of [[John Ruskin]] were a precursor of [[social economy]] (''[[Unto This Last]]'' had a very important impact on [[Mohandas K. Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s philosophy).

====German social thought====
Important [[Germany|German]] philosophers and social thinkers included [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Georg Simmel]], and [[Martin Heidegger]].

{{Hinduism}}
{{Hindu philosophy}}
The [[Upanishadic]] '''philosophy of experience''' expounded by [[Gaudapada]] is based on the cryptic references made by the sage of the [[Mandukya Upanishad]] to the experience of the individual self of its own apparent manifestations in the three fundamental states of consciousness, and to the Fourth known as [[Turiya]]. Turiya is identified with “that goal which all the Vedas declare” - सर्वे वेदा यत् पदमानन्ति ([[Katha Upanishad]] I.ii.15), and whose characteristics are not dissimilar to those of the non-dual [[Brahman]] ([[Mandukya Upanishad]] 7).

==Background==
[[Philosophy]], according to [[Gaudapada]] and [[Adi Sankara]], is an interpretation of the totality of human experience (''bhoga'') or of the whole of life from the standpoint of truth, and the object it seeks is the happiness (''sukham'') and welfare (''hitam'') of all beings (''sarva sattva'') in this world (''ihaiva''). Experience is participation in an event or connecting with a product of one’s own activities; an individual creates the world of his own experiences (''dristisristivada'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intercultural Philosophy|author=Richard King|publisher=SUNY Press|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1bASTAOhjoC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=experience+in+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lO8rU5b3EYLrrQfrkYDACg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=experience%20in%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rishi Kutsa Angirasa ([[Rig Veda]] I.102.2) draws attention to the fact that no happiness can be derived as relating to the material world of objects without knowing each of the constituents of creation endowed with name, form and colour that have made all objects of faith and devotion. Rishi Kakshivan ([[Rig Veda]] I.116.11) points out the subtlety involved in these matters consisting in the fact that the happiness experienced or to be experienced is in the mind and not in the object of faith or pleasure. Participation involves work (effort) and knowledge. Therefore, a [[Rishi]] of the Rig Veda prays:-
: आ त्वां विश्न्त्वाशवः सोमास इन्द्र गिर्वणः |
: शन्ते सन्तु प्रचेतसे || (R.V. I.v.7)
: "May the objects possessed of active qualities required for accomplishing various aims and gains or results prove beneficial to those learned ones who are the doers of praise-worthy deeds, who factually know the objects as to their qualities, means or utility, and their scope."
Here, the Rishi refers to the experiencing of things (active qualities) and inevitable consequences (beneficial results), and also to the mental modes (factually know) . In a mantra ([[Rig Veda]] I.164.32),
: य ईं चकार न सो अस्य वेद य ईं ददर्श हिरुगिन्नु तस्मात् |
: स मातुर्योना परिवीतो अन्तर्बहुप्रजा निर्ऋतिमा विवेश ||
[[Rishi]] [[Dirghatamas]] tells us that he who is engaged in works alone does not know his own form, but he who does and sees actions and knows his form, nature etc., is different who remaining different re-enters protectively in his mother’s womb returns to earth and re-engages again and again in auspicious works and actions. In this manner the Rishi speaks of two distinct experiences – one which is yet to be experienced and the other which is already being experienced repeatedly; the experience which is yet to be experienced is what the Creator does, who creates for creation sake without being concerned about the results of his actions because His actions do not bind Him to anything, who continues to behave as though He is not aware of anything else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=199–200,17,252|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/illumination-of-knowledge-a-brief-reflection-on-the-role-of-agni-the-vedic-god-of-fire/oclc/470877223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient concept of [[Ṛta]] expresses the idea of a regulative principle in nature and human society; the cosmic energies ([[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]), hostile forces ([[Asura]]s) and different spirits ([[Gandharva]]s and [[Apsara]]s), all are subject to Rta. All actions contribute to maintaining the cosmic order in balance through liturgy; the cosmic order is the manifestation of the Ultimate Reality ([[Brahman]]) which is Truth ([[Satya]]). The Rig Veda (X.85.1-2) celebrates the relationship between truth and cosmic law (Ṛta). The Rig Veda (VII.56.12) also gives the equation of cosmic law (Ṛta) and truth (Satya), it was by observing the cosmic law the rishis reached the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads Vol.I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jj8LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=satya+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7xEU8LECIWQrgfS7IDwBQ&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=satya%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Satya'' signifies that which is eternal, the supreme, Existence in its own form ''Sat''; ''rtam'' signifies that which is evident or perceptible, manifested out of the ''satya'', what has come to be in accordance with ''satya'' or that which represents ''satya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Upanishads|author=IslamKotob|publisher=Islamic Books|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONHwyglLcAMC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=satya+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7xEU8LECIWQrgfS7IDwBQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=satya%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The entire philosophy of the [[Upanishads]], is based on the direct experience of the Vedic people; it is concerned with that knowledge which is common to all experience, everywhere, and not only to some specialized exclusive area of experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads: An Introduction|author=Ananda Wood|publisher=Islamic Books|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6Y7MTBjWOEC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=experience+in+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wvIrU4-GJcKOrgfOioHoCg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=experience%20in%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudapada, who rediscovered the '''Philosophy of Experience''' and wrote his ''Karika'' on the [[Mandukya Upanishad]], too emphasises upon the impossibility of reaching the highest truth unless the totality of human experience or knowledge are taken into consideration and that the experiences in the waking state are required to be matched with the experiences in the other states of consciousness so that the individual inquiry is extended to the possible source of all consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion Encyclopaedia of Hindu Philosophy|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZWdEymxyp4C&amp;pg=PA390&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaudapada’s interpretation of Maya==
[[Ajativada]], doctrine that there is no birth or production of substantial or fully real things anywhere or at any time, and therefore no real objective world outside consciousness, is central to Gaudapada who holds that all sensory and mental experience, except the experience of content-less consciousness, is illusion or ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]'', which doctrine of ''Maya'' is in conformity with the [[Vedanta|Vedantic reaches and conclusions]] regarding the sole ever-existing eternal real entity (''paramarthatah''), [[Brahman]], which has nothing different from it, and none whatever outside it (''[[Nondualism|advaita]]''), whose reality can be known ('experienced') through the cultivated meditative experience of non-dual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dispelling Delusion|author=Douglas A. Fox|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=24,40–41|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W4uQY3666I4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintains the doctrine that the universe was not created at all but takes some cognisance at least of the world as real, though it may be for the perfection of mystical endeavour or ethical conduct even though, philosophically, he may regard it as not having been created at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya vidya Bhavan|page=166|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaudapada’s concept of experience==
[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] (II.iii.4-5) tells us that the essence of that which is gross, mortal, limited and defined is the eye, which means that the mental mode associated with comparison is connected with the eye which perceives things and qualities and gives rise to duality and multiplicity i.e. separateness; the eye is the Sun which is the defined but the defined is that which moves within the eye. Gaudapada explores the transcendences by the Self of the three states detailed by the Upanishads and speaks about [[Vaishvanara]], the all-pervading and met with the eye, experiencing the external things; [[Taijasa]] which is inside the mind, as experiencing the inner things and [[Prajna (Vedic)|Prajna]] is the mass of consciousness in the space within the heart, all three interlinked by memory as "I". In this context, [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains that on cessation of the activity called memory Prajna becomes free from diversity and there is no functioning of the mind; perception and recollection are merely vibrations of the mind; in the absence of these there is merely existence of an un-manifested state in the heart. Therefore, the indescribable state of Turiya, is neither a void nor an unreal illusion without a substratum, and is held to be the all-pervasive source of all entities. Vaishvanara and Taijasa are held to be conditioned by cause and effect; Prajna is conditioned by cause, but cause and effect do not exist in Turiya. Cause and effect spring into being so long as there is mental preoccupation with cause and effect; there is no origination of cause and effect when engrossment with cause and effect becomes attenuated. As long as there is mental preoccupation with causality so long does the worldly state continue; when engrossment with causality is exhausted, one does not attain the worldly state. Everything seems to be born because of the empirical outlook; therefore there is nothing eternal; from the standpoint of Reality, everything is the birthless Self; therefore there is no such thing as annihilation (Karika VI.55-57).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eight Upanishads Vol.2|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=193–203,212–213,369–371|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/eight-upanishads-vol-2-gambhirananda/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apparent manifestations of the self==
Gaudapada begins with the three apparent manifestations of the self – 1) as the 'experiencer' of the external world in the '''Waking state''' (''visva'' or ''[[Vaishvanara]] atman''), 2) as the 'experiencer' in the '''Dream state''' (''[[Taijasa]] atman'') and as the 'experiencer' in '''Deep sleep state''' or ''susupti'' ([[Prajna (Vedic)|Prajna]]) when there is no determinate knowledge, but pure consciousness and pure bliss or ''[[Ānanda (Hindu philosophy)|ananda]]''; the person who knows these three as one is never attached to these experiences. He also describes the Fourth state of the self ([[Turiya]]) which is ''advaita'' ('non-dual') and the All. In the Waking state things are imagined as if existing outside, and in the Dream state, things are imagined internally, both of them are illusory creations of the self; truth is that reality which is perceived as the imagination-less cessation of all appearances (''nirvikalpah prapancopasamah''). The thing that has beginning and an end is false; the existing of things is illusory; things exist only as far as they merely appear or are related to experience and as merely thoughts with which fools are deluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Philosophy Vol.1|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=424,426,428|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&amp;pg=PA424&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaudapada’s examination of the experience of the experiencing self==
Gaudapada points out that the unchangeable reality is the witness behind the three states of consciousness, waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep, in all these states the Self is ever-present, and though remaining unknown is the unaffected 'experiencer' of all actions and thoughts in these three states. In deep sleep the mind is withdrawn and does not know anything, but it is disciplined and not withdrawn in ''turiya'', existent and all-seeing. When the individual self, sleeping under the influence of ''maya'' ('ignorance'), is awakened, it then realizes non-duality which is beginning-less and endless; this is the way to illumination within one’s own soul to realize supreme bliss. Gaudapada insists that the mind should not be allowed to enjoy the bliss that arises out of the condition of absorption. It should be freed from attachment to such happiness through the exercise of discrimination. When the mind does not lose itself in inactivity and oblivion, or is not distracted by desires, when the mind achieves quietness and does not give rise to appearances, it verily becomes Brahman. The waking and the dreaming states are equally real and equally unreal, real only in relative sense and unreal as compared with the transcendental in which there is identification with Reality, the unchangeable Self. There is no absolute reality of creation, the one infinite Existence appears to be the manifold universe which universe is not a reality but something superimposed upon the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]. Bondage and liberation, the individual soul and the world, are all unreal. The supreme bliss is the very nature of the Atman, an absolute reality which persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spiritual Heritage of India|author= Swami Prabhavananda|publisher=Vedanta Press|pages=276–278|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zupDCwE73O0C&amp;pg=PA275&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patanjali’s concept of experience==
[[Patanjali]] tells us that experiences of pleasure and pain are the fruits of merit and demerit, respectively; pain is caused by false identification of the experiencer with the object of experience, and the pain which is yet to come may be avoided. The "experiencer" is the Atman, the real human nature, and the "object of experience" is the totality of the apparent world, including the mind and the senses; so long as the experiencer is falsely identified with the object of experience the Atman cannot be known. [[Patanjali]] states – अभाव – प्रत्ययालम्बना वृत्तिर्निद्रा ([[Yoga Sutra]] I.10) that "sleep is a wave of thought about nothingness", which means sleep is a positive experience of nothingness, when the already perceived objects are not forgotten but as experiences unite themselves to the system which existed at the time of going to sleep, in that state there is continuity of experience and the function of remembering is not reduced to utter confusion. He explains that the mind having innumerable impressions and desires acts only to serve the Atman and is able to perceive because it reflects both the Atman and the objects of perception, it cannot act independently for its own sake. The man of discrimination ceases to regard the mind as the Atman, and moves towards liberation. Distractions due to past impressions may arise if the mind relaxes its discrimination, even a little but can be overcome in the same manner as obstacles to enlightenment, that is, by resolving the mind back into its primal cause through meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Patanjali Yoga Sutras|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=9,160–162,83–85|url=http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/patanjali-yoga-sutras/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patanjali tells us – तस्य सप्तधा प्रान्तभूमिः प्रज्ञा ([[Yoga Sutras]] II.27) that the experiencer gains the knowledge of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] in seven stages, advancing towards the highest beginning with - a) the realization that the source of all spiritual wisdom is inside us, and proceeding to b) when attachments and aversions lose their power, to c) complete realization of, and union with the Atman when the objective universe disappears, to d) when the man of illumination no longer identifies the external world with the Atman, to e) when the mind and the objective world ends their services to the experiencer, to f) when the stored-up impressions within the mind and the [[guna]]s fall away forever, and finally to g) when the state of eternal existence in union with the Atman is reached. [[Swami Prabhavananda]] in connection with Yoga Sutra II.50 tells us that [[Prana]] is the vital energy by which we live and all the powers of the body and all the functions of the senses  and the mind are expressions of the force of Prana; when the [[Kundalini]] is aroused it produces various degrees of enlightenment experienced by the experiencer at seven centers  – according to [[Raja yoga]] when the mind is attached to worldliness, when it dwells in three lower centers, it has no higher spiritual ambitions or visions and stays immersed in the cravings of lust and greed; the fourth center is the heart dwelling wherein the mind makes one experience the first spiritual awakening and is filled with wonder and awe; the mind reaching the fifth center, the throat, makes one freed from ignorance and delusion; with the mind reaching the sixth center, the forehead, there is the direct vision of the Lord; and when the mind reaches the seventh center at the top of the head, [[Samadhi]] is attained. These are the seven gradual yogic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Patanjali Yoga Sutras|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=92–95, 115–116|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/patanjali-yoga-sutras/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==
In response to his query – "Which is the deity who experiences dream?" – Surya was told - अत्रैष देवः स्वप्ने महिमानमनुभवति – "In the dream state the deity, the mind, experiences greatness (consisting in assuming diverse forms of subject and object)" ([[Prasna Upanishad]] IV.5); the mind is the instrument of the perceiver in the matter of experiencing greatness, and Sankara explains that the individual soul conditioned by the mind only appears to experience things in its wakefulness and in the dream-state. The body and senses depend on ignorance, desire, and the result of past actions, when these become quiet the nature of the Self becomes non-dual, auspicious and calm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eight Upanishads Vol.2|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=456–462|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/eight-upanishads-vol-2-gambhirananda/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common experience of Duality, which contains truth and untruth, is produced by the power of illusion (''Maya''), it is only through religious activities that are features of duality – based experiences that the understanding and attainment of the supreme non-dual becomes possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy|author=Oliver Leaman|publisher=Routledge|page=217|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWwptHSgGhoC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudapada and Sankara relate ''māyā'' to the Vedic metaphor of hidden (''gūdha'') Brahman ([[Katha Upanishad]] (I.iii.12)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shankara and Indian Philosophy|author=N.V.Isaeva|publisher=SUNY Press|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hshaWu0m1D4C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudapada shows that it is only the existent that can appear, the non-existent cannot appear. Sankara tells us that the common experience depends on ''[[adhyasa]]'' (cognition of 'that' in 'not-that'), on something superimposed, and which is a transcendental error or ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]]''. ''[[Dvaita]]'' in whatever form is perceived by the mind, duality ceases when the mind ceases to exist and function as the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Jaina Philosophy|author=Nathmal Tatia|publisher=Jain Publishing|pages=119–120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZ7IwbORbLgC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JmIqU8ylJNHRrQfq8oCgCg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; And, Sankara concedes that the ''[[Samadhi]]''  experience ('Transcendental Consciousness'), which describes the state devoid of cognitive functioning, will not be established, if the phenomenal self is not considered distinct from the cognitive faculty which faculty cannot be an agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Free Will, Agency and Selfhood in Indian Philosophy|author=|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWLSAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IWMqU4ynIcbsrAeLroHABg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sankara insists:

:सङ्घातोऽपि तथा नाहमिति दृश्यविलक्षणम् |
:दृष्टारमनुमानेन निपुणं सम्प्रधारय ||

:"Similarly be sure that you are not the complex of the gross and the subtle-bodies, and intelligently determine, by inference, that you, the ‘seer’, are entirely distinct from the seen" ([[Vakya Vritti]].Sl. 17)

which means that a person should firmly ascertain that in himself he is something other than the gross and the subtle bodies. In his commentary on this statement, [[Swami Chinmayananda]] tells us that the misapprehension that the products of matter, such as body, mind and intellect, are the Self, is an experience caused by the non-apprehension of the Spiritual Essence; the non-apprehension of the Supreme Self in all its supreme transcendental resplendency, generates endless misapprehensions which are to be removed by invoking knowledge, the direct apprehension of the Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vakya Vritti of Adi Sankara 1991 ed.|publisher=Central Chinmaya Mission Trust|page=39|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/vakya-vritti-of-adi-sankara-text-with-translation-and-commentary-by-swami-chinmayananda/oclc/248649509/editions?referer=di&amp;editionsView=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Sankara, [[Ramanuja]] does not admit a distinction between illusory perception and true perception, for he declares that even in illusory perception, so-called, there is some perception of reality. Thus all experience has its validity. The immediate intuition of God is not the highest transcendental consciousness (Turiya) but rather it is the transcendental experience of God in which there remains the ego as distinct from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spiritual Heritage of India|author=Swami Prabhavananda|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|page=308|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/spiritual-heritage-of-india/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|R.D.Ranade]] states that the Upanishadic seers throw hints and suggest the way for realizing the Self, only too cognizant of the fact that any description of the great mystic experience by word of mouth would fall short of reality, as much as any mediate, intellectual, or expressible knowledge would fall short of immediate, intuitive, first-hand experience. There is the same gulf between the expression of an experience and the enjoyment of it, as there is between knowledge and being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher= Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=239|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre Lévy''' ({{IPA-fr|levi|lang}}; born 1956 in [[Tunis]]) is a [[French people|French]] philosopher, [[Culture theory|cultural theorist]] and [[media scholar]] who specializes in the understanding of the cultural and cognitive implications of digital technologies and the phenomenon of human collective intelligence.

He introduced the [[collective intelligence]] concept in his 1994 book ''L'intelligence collective: Pour une anthropologie du cyberspace'' (''Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace'').&lt;ref&gt;L'intelligence collective. Pour une anthropologie du cyberspace, Paris, La Découverte, 1994 ({{ISBN|2-7071-2693-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; Lévy's 1995 book, ''Qu'est-ce que le virtuel?'' (translated as ''Becoming Virtual: Reality in the Digital Age'') develops philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]]'s conception of "the virtual" as a dimension of reality that subsists with the actual but is irreducible to it. In 2001, he wrote the  book ''Cyberculture''.

Pierre Lévy currently teaches at the communication department of the [[University of Ottawa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieml.org/spip.php?article13 |title=ieml |publisher=ieml |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032913/http://www.ieml.org/spip.php?article13 |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he holds a Canada Research Chair in Collective Intelligence. Lévy is fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] and received several awards and academic distinctions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Life and work==
Pierre Lévy is one of the major philosophers working on the implications of [[cyberspace]] and digital communications. Lévy has written a dozen of books that have been translated in more than 12 languages and are studied in many universities all over the world. His principal work, published in French in 1994 and translated into English, is entitled ''Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace''.&lt;ref&gt;''Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace'' {{ISBN|0-7382-0261-4}} Perseus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1990 Lévy published a book about the merging of digital networks and [[Hypertext|hypertextual]] communication. Levy's theory of knowledge spaces and the cosmopedia foreshadowed the emergence of Wikipedia and anticipates [[wikinomics]], and the efficacy of shared distributed knowledge systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Pierre|title=Collective Intelligence|year=1997|publisher=Plenium Trade|location=New York and London|isbn=0306456354|pages=215–220|quote=.  In the fourth space, "the subject of knowledge is shaped by its encyclopedia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993 to 1998 Lévy was Professor at the [[University of Paris VIII: Vincennes—Saint-Denis|University of Paris VIII]], where he studied the concept of collective intelligence and knowledge-based societies. He has contributed to many scholarly discourses about [[cyberculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cochran|first=Terry|title=Thinking at the Edge of the Galaxy: Pierre Levy's World Projection|journal=Boundary|year=1999|volume=2|series=26|issue=3|pages=63–85|url=http://muse.jhu.edu.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/journals/boundary/v026/26.3cochran.html|accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the editorial board of the ''[[Revue virtuelle]]'' project of the [[Pompidou Center]] in Paris from 1995 to 1997 and was the author of a report on cyberculture for the Council of Europe in 1996.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In the chapter [[Interactivity]] from his book ''Cyberculture'' (2001), Lévy argues that analogue communication (telephone, mail) differs from digital communication (email, chat) in terms of temporal organization and material involvement of their communication systems. He claims that [[interactivity]] is a vague term that "has more to do with finding the solution to a problem, the need to develop new ways to observe, design, and evaluate methods of communication, than it does with identifying a simple, unique characteristic that can be assigned to a given system".&lt;ref&gt;Lévy, Pierre. "Cyberculture". Univ. of Minnesota Press. 2001, p. 228. ({{ISBN|0816636109}})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Jenkins]], among others, cites him as an important influence on theories of online collective intelligence.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In ''Becoming Virtual: Reality in the Digital Age'' Lévy explores the way we virtualise every aspect of our lives, from [[real time (media)]] interaction through language, to our actions through technology, and our social relations through institutions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} And in each case the mechanism is the same: we create some artifact, more or less material, which allows us to shift what's at stake away from the immediate here-and-now and towards a problematic where new possibilities open up.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Current project==
Lévy's current project focuses on the development of an [[Information Economy MetaLanguage]] (IEML) for the purposes of improving knowledge management as part of his works on the design of a universal system for [[semantic]] addressing of digital documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieml.org/spip.php?article9&amp;lang=en |title=ieml |publisher=ieml |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032920/http://www.ieml.org/spip.php?article9&amp;lang=en |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Álvaro |first=Sandra |url=http://blogs.cccb.org/lab/en/article_ieml-projecte-per-a-un-nou-humanisme-entrevista-a-pierre-levy/ |title=IEML: A PROJECT FOR A NEW HUMANISM.

== Life and work ==
Stone was born Rudolph Bautsch in 1890 in Austria. He immigrated with his family to the United States in 1898 and changed his name to Randolf Stone in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Cooksey2005 /&gt; During that period he began studying several different practices and became qualified in chiropractic.

'''Seonbi''' were virtuous scholars during the [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon]] periods of [[Korea]] who served the public without a government position,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leaman|first1=Oliver|title=Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy|date=Oct 19, 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134691142|page=143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWwptHSgGhoC&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; choosing to pass up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yeongju where the spirit of the seonbi lives on|url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Travel/view?articleId=113641|website=Korea.net|publisher=Korean Culture and Information Service|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who chose to serve the government were obliged to assist the king in governing the nation properly, and once out of office, lead a quiet life in the countryside, teaching and leading the people in the right direction.&lt;ref name="Choi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Choi|first=Wan Gee|title=The Traditional Education of Korea|date=2006|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|isbn=9788973006755|pages=29–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kPUREgXLRaAC&amp;pg=PT30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
The seonbi followed a strict [[code of conduct]] and believed they had the moral duty to lead society in the right direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Choi|first1=Wan Gee|title=The Traditional Education of Korea|date=2006|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|isbn=9788973006755|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kPUREgXLRaAC&amp;pg=PT66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 February 2017|language=en|quote="The seonbi, or literati class, of Joseon followed a strict code of behavior in the belief that they had the moral duty to lead society in the right direction."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seonbi were to live life in modesty and perpetual learning in order to attain perfection of character, not only through knowledge but also by adhering to the rightful path. The goal of the seonbi was to achieve social justice.&lt;ref name="Choi" /&gt;

Seonbi were expected to possess the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] virtues of filial piety and loyalty to the king, disdain power, wealth and private interest, and be ready to lay down their life in order to remain faithful to their principles and maintain their  integrity. They venerated scholars such as [[Jeong Mong-ju]] (who died for his fidelity to [[Goryeo]]), the [[six martyred ministers]] (who refused to accept [[Sejo of Joseon|Sejo]]'s usurpation of the throne), and [[Jo Gwang-jo]] (a reformer who died trying to transform Joseon into an ideal Confucian society) as embodiments of the seonbi spirit and as examples to follow.

Education was of great importance and referred to as "enlightenment",&lt;ref name="Choi" /&gt; and seonbi gathered and studied at [[seowon]] institutions.&lt;ref name="antique"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seowon – Korean Confucius Academy|url=http://www.antiquealive.com/Blogs/Seowon_Korean_Confucian_College.html|website=Antique Alive|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seonbi masculinity denotes mental attainment rather than physical performance, and is still valued by many South Koreans and considered by some scholars to be the ideal model of Korean masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jung|first1=Sun|title=Korean Masculinities and Transcultural Consumption: Yonsama, Rain, Oldboy, K-Pop Idols|date=Nov 1, 2010|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=9789888028665|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npgE-K9rawUC&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seonbi had deep sympathy for the hardships of the common class. In their pursuit of social justice, the seonbi submitted blunt petitions to the king despite the dangerous consequences and suffered many [[Korean literati purges|purges]] as a result.&lt;ref name="antique" /&gt; Due to their reputation for integrity and incorruptibility, the seonbi were idealized and romanticized in popular imagination as men of honor in contrast to the ruling [[yangban]] class, even though seonbi came from the same class. The seonbi was a common figure in traditional Korean depictions of the Joseon period. For instance, a seonbi appears as one of the characters in the [[Korean mask|traditional mask dance]] preserved at the [[Hahoe Folk Village]], where he competes with a [[yangban]] character, often depicted as corrupt and greedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=하회별신굿탈놀이|url=http://www.hahoe.or.kr/coding/sub3/sub1_2.asp|website=안동하회마을|accessdate=5 February 2017|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern depictions==
Modern depictions of seonbi in popular media are ubiquitous, with some examples being:

* [[Kim Soo-hyun]] in the Korean drama ''[[My Love from the Star]]''

{{Sufism}}

The relationship between [[Salafism]] and [[Sufis]] – two movements of Islam with different interpretations of Islam – is historically diverse and reflects some of the changes and conflicts in the Muslim world today.&lt;ref&gt;Akbar Ahmed ''Journey Into America: The Challenge of Islam'', 2010, page 261 "The relationship between Salafis and Sufis, in particular, is complicated and reflects some of the changes and current conflicts in the Muslim world."&lt;/ref&gt;

Salafism is associated with [[wikt:literalist|literalist]], [[wikt:legalism|strict]] and [[wikt:puritanical|puritanical]] approaches to Islam. In the [[Western world]] it is often associated with the [[Salafist jihadism]] &lt;ref&gt;Dr Abdul-Haqq Baker, ''Extremists in Our Midst: Confronting Terror,'' Palgrave Macmillan, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Sufism is associated with the rectification of the soul (tasawuf) and is mainly focused in becoming a better Muslim and person to achieve a higher status in paradise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zrpmm4120OUC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=introduction+to+shia++sufi+qutb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PkUxUbHQJsa2yAGThoCwBA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Introduction the Modern Middle East: History, Religion, Political Economy ...] By David S. Sorenson&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are Muslims who believe that Salafism and Sufism "overlap", the "standard" Salafi response to Sufism has been called "polemical".&lt;ref name=purity/&gt; According to various observers, Salafists have been "usually ... unrelentingly hostile to devotional Sufi practices",&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2hxmm2N6jOgC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=sufism+salafi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xflBUZnnEaGSyQHIyYCIAQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sufism%20salafi&amp;f=false Princeton Readings in Islamist Thought: Texts and Contexts from Al-Banna to ... ] By Roxanne Leslie Euben, Muhammad Qasim Zaman&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that Sufism is "irreconcilable with true Islam",&lt;ref name=purity&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LCL5fElYbnYC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=sufism+salafi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xflBUZnnEaGSyQHIyYCIAQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sufism%20salafi&amp;f=false Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God] By Richard Gauvain, p.305&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the elements  "corrupting" modern day Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA601&amp;lpg=PA601&amp;dq=encyclopedia+of+islam+salafi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eWonwHtUV8&amp;sig=apST5S7ee_WHGF8WK1Nac5CGeiA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6PFBUeOCGc6tygHWy4DQAg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=encyclopedia%20of%20islam%20salafi&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of Islam] By Juan Eduardo Campo, p.601 ("Salafists have ... promote[d] their message that Islam, as well as Muslim society, is in crisis, having been corrupted from within by backward-thinking Ulama, Sufism, a spurious innovations.")&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between the two movements have been described as one with "battle lines drawn",&lt;ref name=west/&gt; or a "rift" found in "practically every Muslim country",&lt;ref&gt;as of 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and in "the Muslim diasporic communities of the West"&lt;ref name=Knysh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knysh|first=Alexander|title=Contextualising the Salafi-Sufi Conflict,|journal=''Middle Eastern studies''|year=2007|volume=43|issue=4|pages=503–30 at p.507|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LCL5fElYbnYC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=rift+salafi+sufi#v=onepage&amp;q=rift%20salafi%20sufi&amp;f=false|quote="The rift between the Salafis/Wahhabis and the Sufis is not unique to the Caucasus. It is found in practically every Muslim country today (as well as the Muslim diasporic communities of the West),"|isbn=9781136446931}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well.

==History==
Much of the antagonism against Sufism by Salafists is attributed to the writings of the eighteenth century figure, [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]], and those who followed him. Some argue that his original followers were more conciliatory towards what they viewed as Sufism, with the son of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab writing, &lt;blockquote&gt;"We do not negate the way of the Sufis and the purification of the inner self from the vices of those sins connected to the heart and the limbs as long as the individual firmly adheres to the rules of Shari‘ah and the correct and observed way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=al-Makki|first=Abd al-Hafiz|title=Shaykh Muhammad bin ‘Abd al-Wahhab and Sufism|url=http://www.deoband.org/2011/01/tasawwuf/shariah-and-tariqah-tasawwuf/shaykh-muhammad-bin-%E2%80%98abd-al-wahhab-and-sufism/
|publisher=Deoband.org|accessdate=29 March 2017|quote=I studied each volume page by page and never came across any place in which Shaykh Muhammad bin ‘Abd al-Wahhab criticizes, refutes or rejects Tasawwuf or any one of the Sufi shaykhs on account of his Tasawwuf.}}&lt;/ref&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following a tripling in the price of oil in the mid-1970s and the progressive takeover of [[Saudi Aramco]] oil company between 1974 and 1980, the Kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]] acquired large sums of revenue from oil exports. It began to spend tens of billions of dollars throughout the Islamic World to promote the movement of Islam favored in that country — known as [[Salafi movement|Salafi]] Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Kepel, Gilles, ''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam'' Belknap Press of Harvard University Press (31 March 2003)|2002|pp=69–75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20120929-how-saudi-arabia-petrodollars-finance-salafist-winter-islamism-wahhabism-egypt How Saudi petrodollars fuel rise of Salafism]| france24.com 30 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;documentary  ''The Qur'an'' aired in the UK, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/tv-radio-reviews/last-nights-tv-the-quran-channel-4-banged-up-five-867474.html ''The Qur'an'' review in ''The Independent'']&lt;/ref&gt;   According to [[Pnina Werbner]], Saudi funding of "the Wahhabi/Salafi critique" (along with the forces of modernization) put "Sufi ''tariqas''" in "danger of disappearing altogether" in the 1970 and 80s. Though the tariqas have "revived themselves" since then, Werbner describes the twenty-first century as dawning "with battle lines drawn up between" the two groups "within the world of Sunni Islam."&lt;ref name=west&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Pnina Werbner |last=Werbner|first=Pnina|title=Sufism in the West|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|editor=Jamal Malik, John Hinnells|chapter=Learning the lessons from the neorevivalist and Wahhabi movements|quote=Even back in 1971, [J. Spencer] Trimingham argued that the Sufi ''tariqas'' were in decline and danger of disappearing altogether under the dual threat of modernization and the Wahhabi/Salafi critique heavily supported by propaganda materials funded by the superior wealth of the Saudi regime. ... However, this has not materialized: during the decades of the 1980s and the 1990s, tariqas have revived themselves as they have begun to fight back against the Wahhabi/Salafi critique, and the twenty-first century dawn with battle lines drawn up between these two conflicting groups within the world of Sunni Islam.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamopedia.org states that Salafi groups have been "accused of perpetrating the destruction and burning of a number of Sufi mosques and shrines" as of 2011, a "reflection of the resurgence of the long suppressed animosity" between the two groups.&lt;ref name=violence/&gt;
The Grand Mufti of [[Al Azhar]] [[Ali Gomaa]], himself an adherent of Sufism, criticized this trend as unacceptable.&lt;ref name=violence/&gt;

==Difference in beliefs and practices==
There are a number of Sufi beliefs and practices that Salafi believe are "un-Islamic":
*Definition of [[bid‘ah]] (innovation in religious matters) — traditional Sufi scholars argue for an inclusive, holistic definition&lt;ref name="The Concept of Bid‘a in the Islamic Shari‘a1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Keller|first=Nuh Ha Mim|title=The Concept of Bid‘a in the Islamic Shari‘a|url=http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/nuh/bida.htm|year=1995|publisher=Muslim Academy Trust]|pages=1–2|isbn=1-902350-02-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Salafi scholars argue for an exclusive, literal definition that entails anything not specifically performed or confirmed by the Prophet.
*[[Mawlid]] (celebration of the birth of the prophet Muhammad) — considered bid‘ah by Salafis.&lt;ref name=Mir/&gt;
*[[Urs]] (commemoration of the death anniversary of Sufi saints) — considered bid‘ah by Salafis.&lt;ref name=Mir/&gt;
*[[Nasheed]] (poetry in praise of the prophet Muhammad) — opposed by Salafis. However, Some Salafis consider poetry in praise of the prophet with no music to be permissible.
*[[Dhikr]] ceremonies (remembrance of God) — opposed by Salafis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/may/10/islam-sufi-salafi-egypt-religion Salafi intolerance threatens Sufis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroot.com/views/root-explainer-what-difference-between-sunni-shi-ite-and-sufi-muslims?page=0,1 What Is the Difference Between Sunni, Shiite and Sufi Muslims?]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tawassul]] (intercession) the act of supplicating to Allah through a prophet, pious person or Sufi saint, living or dead. According to Salafis, "relying on an intermediary between oneself and Allah when seeking intercession" is among the "ten actions that negate Islam". Some Salafis believe that a living pious man can be asked to pray to God as Tawassul.&lt;ref name=tawassul/&gt;
*[[Shafa'ah|Wasilah]] (intercessionary powers of the prophet Muhammad) — Salafis hold Wasilah akin to [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] (polytheism). They argue that the prophet Muhammad was a mortal and being so is no longer alive and thus incapable of intercession on behalf of those who pray to him. Sufis hold that although not physically present in the world, the prophets, martyrs and saints are still alive. Some Salafis believe that Wasilah mentioned in Quran and hadith can be taken like Wasilah of good deeds or Wasilah of different attribute names of God&lt;ref name=tawassul&gt;{{cite web|title=Intercession - Tawassul|url=http://sunnah.org/ibadaat/tawassul.htm|publisher=sunnah.org|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indianmuslims.in"/&gt;
*[[Ziyarat]] (visiting the graves of prophets and Sufi saints) — The Sufi practice of visiting the graves of Saints is also objected to by Salafis. Salafis believe that a Muslim can take journey to only three holiest place of Islam that is Mecca, Medina, and Mosque of Jerusalem as mentioned in of the hadith of prophet.

{{See also|Dungan Revolt (1895–96)}}
Salafism/Wahabbism is opposed by some [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslims in [[China]], primarily by the [[Sufi]] [[Khafiya]], some [[Hanafi]] [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Gedimu]] and a number of [[Jahriyya]]. The [[Yihewani]] (Ikhwan) Chinese sect founded by [[Ma Wanfu]] in China was originally inspired by the Wahhabi movement, but evolved away from their origins.  When Ma Debao and Ma Zhengqing, attempted to introduce Wahhabism as the Orthodox main form of Islam in China, Yihewani reacted with hostility, accusing Ma Debao and Ma Zhengqing of being traitors of foreign influence, alien to the native popular cultural practices of Islam in China, "Heterodox" (''xie jiao''), and "people who followed foreigner's teachings" (''wai dao''),&lt;ref name=rubin/&gt; and Wahhabi teachings were deemed as heresy by the Yihewani leaders. Yihewani eventually became a secular Chinese nationalist organisation.&lt;ref name=rubin/&gt;

Ma Debao established a Salafi / Wahhabi order, called the [[Salafi|Sailaifengye]] [[menhuan]] in [[Lanzhou]] and [[Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture|Linxia]], separate from other Muslim sects in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A May 2010 ban by the [[Ministry of Awqaf (Egypt)|Ministry of Awqaf]] (religious endowments) of centuries old Sufi [[dhikr]] gatherings (devoted to the remembrance of God, and including dancing and religious songs) has been described as "another victory for extreme Salafi thinking at the expense of Egypt's moderate Sufism".  Clashes followed at [[Cairo]]'s [[Al-Hussein Mosque]] and al-Sayyida Zeinab mosques between members of Sufi orders and security forces who forced them to evacuate the two shrines.

In early April 2011, a Sufi march from [[Al-Azhar Mosque]] to [[Al-Hussein Mosque]] was followed by a  massive protest before Al-Hussein Mosque, "expressing outrage at the destruction" of Sufi shrines.

According to the newspaper ''[[Al-masry Al-youm]]'' (Today’s Egyptian), in Egypt's second biggest city — Alexandria — the headquarters for 36 Sufi groups and home of half a million Sufis, "16 historic mosques" belonging to Sufi orders have been "marked for destruction by Salafis".

===Georgia===
In the [[Pankisi Gorge]], home to the Kists, a small Muslim ethnic group, the Sufi-Wahhabi split is generational. The older Kists keep Sufi traditions, but young people scorn the old practices and pray in "new, gleaming mosques". Pankisi is reportedly the "only place in Georgia where people keep Sufism alive." Wahhabism entered into "a dozen Pankisi villages in the 1990s, popularized by young people educated in Arab countries". (The "Wahhabis" do not use the term but agree they are practicing a form of Sunni Islam "similar to that which prevails in Saudi Arabia.") Because of close family ties, there has been no violence between the two groups, although Sufis protested loudly over the tearing down of a Sufi shrine to make way for a new Wahhabi mosque.&lt;ref name=TOL&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chitanava and|first1=Eka|last2=Kochiashvili|first2=Marika|title=A Growing Gap in Pankisi Gorge|url=http://www.tol.org/client/article/21739-a-growing-gap-in-pankisi-gorge.html|accessdate=20 May 2015|agency=Transitions Online|date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(The term "Wahabbi" in India can have contradictory definitions depending on the user of the term, according to author Yoginder Sikand. It is used by [[Barelvi]] and related Muslims to refer to Sunni critics of "practices associated with the shrines of the Sufis". These critics  being principally [[Deobandi]] and [[Ahl-e Hadith]] Muslims. Deobandi used the term to refer to the more strict Ahl-e Hadith who oppose ''[[taqlid]]'' (‘imitation’) of one of the four ''[[Madhhab]]'' (major schools of Sunni jurisprudence), and any form of Sufism. The Ahl-e Hadith refer to themselves as "Salafi" not Wahabbi.&lt;ref name="indianmuslims.in"&gt;[http://indianmuslims.in/wahhabism-in-india/ ‘Wahhabism’ in India]|Yoginder Sikand |indianmuslims.in |2 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Russia===
While traditionally Christian, Russia has a number of Muslim-majority Republics or "federal subjects", such as Dagestan and Chechnya.   
;Dagestan

(In Dagestan "Wahhabi" is the term used by most Dagestanis, although practitioners prefer the term "pure" or "true" Muslims.&lt;ref name=Ware-2010-91&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Dagestan: Russian Hegemony and Islamic Resistance in the North Caucasus|date=2010|publisher=Routledge.|page=91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5VPfBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=dagestan+saudi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NjNObQCWIr&amp;sig=hs04iRXgyaPq7OEyylm8MoIbPOM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QiNeVYefNImoogTW9IDoCg&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=dagestan%20saudi&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
While Islam arrived in Dagestan in the late Middle Ages as Sufi Islam "infused with local customs", Salafists began to have an impact by way of Afghanistan after the Soviet Union crumbled in the late 1980s&lt;ref name=clash&gt;{{cite web|title=In Russia's Dagestan, Salafi Muslims clash with government authorities|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/europe/in-russias-dagestan-salafi-muslims-clash-with-government-authorities|work=14 September 2011|publisher=The National|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although one Salafist scholar—Yaseen Rasulov—maintains that the ideas of salafist jurist [[Ibn Taimiyah]] were already popular in Dagestan in the 16th and 17th centuries and that Salafists have always led jihad against colonizing Russians).&lt;ref name=smirnov&gt;{{cite web|last=Smirnov|first=Andrei|title=Yaseen Rasulov: Dagestan’s Rebel Scholar|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=3435|publisher=Jamestown Foundation|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to the [[Abu Dhabi]] [[The National (Abu Dhabi)|National]] newspaper
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Salafis dislike the Sufi alliance with the government. Sufis run the government-sanctioned Spiritual Board of Muslims, to which the official clergy belong. They also support a secular state. Salafis do not.&lt;ref name=clash/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the Economist magazine "The Islamisation of the conflict" between Caucasus Muslims (in Dagestan and Chechnya) and Russia after the 1994 and 1999 Chechnya Wars "opened up a fierce sectarian fight between Sufism" and Salafism.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite journal|title=Islamists in Russia|journal=The Economist|date=27 April 2013|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21576728-boston-bombs-have-put-new-focus-russias-islamist-republics-islamists-russia|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 2000s the Salafis in Dagestan "were winning support among young Muslims", while the Sufis were "tainted by association with a corrupt and dysfunctional state".&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;
Salafist are associated with the forest-based insurgency that has killed an average of three policeman a week in 2011, while police killed 100 people they identified as rebels, over a nine-month period in 2011.&lt;ref name=clash/&gt;

In October 2011, Sirazhutdin Khurikski, an influential Sufi sheikh in southern Dagestan, was killed.&lt;ref name="Jamestown2013_1"/&gt; In late August 2012, a revered Sufi scholar [[Said Afandi al-Chirkawi|Sheikh Said Afandi]] and 5 others were among killed in Dagestan suicide bomb attack.
A seventy-five-year-old cleric in the Sufi Brotherhood, Afandi was a key Sufi leader in the North Caucasus and had publicly denounced Salafism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20120830/175517955.html |title=Sheikh Murdered Over Religious Split Say Analysts &amp;#124; Russia &amp;#124; RIA Novosti |publisher=En.rian.ru |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/world/sufi-scholar-5-others-killed-dagestan-suicide-bomb-attack sufi scholar 5 others killed dagestan suicide bomb attack] arabnews.com| 2012.08.30&lt;/ref&gt; Another Sufi Sheikh, Ilyas-haji Ilyasov was assassinated on 3 August 2013, just a year after Said Afandi.&lt;ref name="Jamestown2013_1"&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=41243&amp;no_cache=1#.VUobEo7hB9g Murder of Leading Dagestani Cleric Signals Deepening Crisis in Sufi Hierarchy] - by Mairbek Vatchagaev, Jamestown Foundation, 8 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The President ([[Aslan Maskhadov]]) of another Muslim-majority "federal subject" of Russia, Chechnya, took the side of Sufism against Salafism, saying, "We are [[Naqshbandi|Nakshband]] and Kadari and Sunnites, and there is no place for any other Islamic sect in Chechnya. ...

===Saudi Arabia===
In Saudi Arabia for many years Sufi brotherhoods, (also known as "mystical" brotherhoods), were proscribed by the government, and a "monopoly on religious matters" was given to the official "scholarly Islam of ulemas", according to [[Gilles Kepel]].&lt;ref name=kepel-50&gt;

|quote=While most Muslim governments in the 1960s were tolerant of popular Islam, the one state that proscribed the brotherhoods even more strictly than secular Turkey or Algeria (Where prohibition was eventually lifted) was Saudi Arabia. Here, the scholarly Islam of ulemas claimed a monopoly on religious matters and dictated the only acceptable discourse on the central values of society and political order. Mystics and secularist intellectuals were held in particular opprobrium.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official religion  supported by the [[ulema]] in Saudi Arabia is often referred to as [[Wahhabism]], but according to at least one source (Saudi author Abdul Aziz Qassim), its adherents prefer to call it the "Salafi movement of the Sheikh".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/there-is-no-such-thing-as-wahabism-saudi-prince-says There is no such thing as Wahabism, Saudi prince says]| Wael Mahdi| The National| 18 March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Journalist [[Karen Elliott House]] refers to Salafism as "a more politically correct term for Wahhabis" (source: {{cite book|author=House, Karen Elliott|title=On Saudi Arabia : Its People, past, Religion, Fault Lines and Future| publisher=Knopf|year=2012|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIu0LSe8aVwC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=%22on+saudi%22+karen+elliott+house+%22more+politically+correct+term%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22on%20saudi%22%20karen%20elliott%20house%20%22more%20politically%20correct%20term%22&amp;f=false|isbn=0307473287}})&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] (where 15 of the 19 hijackers turned out to be Saudi), brought scrutiny to the official religion in Saudi. Amongst other things it has "put the brakes on the practice of [[takfir]]" of other interpretations of Islam by the Saudi religious establishment, according to one Sufi in Saudi Arabia quoted in a [[Washington Post]] article. As of 2006 Sufi gatherings are legal in the Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Ambah&gt;{{cite news|last=Ambah|first=Faiza Saleh|title=In Saudi Arabia, a Resurgence of Sufism|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/01/AR2006050101380.html|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=2 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somalia===
Traditionally, Islam in Somalia has followed moderate Sufism (as well as [[Ash'ari|Ash’ariyah]] theology and [[Shafi’i]] jurisprudence).&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;  Salafi theology has arrived in Somalia in recent decades via the influence of students educated at Islamic universities in Saudi Arabia and migrant workers returning from Saudi.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;  Somali students of religion educated in Saudi Arabia, were often employed by the many Saudi institutions created to preach "the right theology" (i.e. Salafi theology) and received "massive economic and technical assistance" from their well-funded former hosts.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;

Extreme versions of Salafism such as [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabab]] and earlier [[Hizbul Islam]] have used force to impose their version of Islamism&lt;ref name=roots&gt;[http://www.aarannews.com/?p=15410 The Roots of the Islamic Conflict in Somalia (2)]| Aaran news| 28 September 2010| accessed 20 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; (though those groups appear to be in conflict with most Salafi scholars&lt;ref name=abukar&gt;{{cite web|last=Abukar|first=Hassan|title=Somalia's Salafi Groups and Fatwa Wars|url=http://somalicolumn.blogspot.com/2012/11/somalias-salafi-groups-and-fatwa-wars.html|work=November 21, 2012|publisher=Somali Observer|accessdate=27 March 2013|quote=In July of this year [2012], a group of 22 Somali Salafi scholars met in Nairobi, Kenya, and issued a fatwa (a religious edict) that condemned a young Somali cleric based in Kenya named Shaikh Hassaan Hussein Adam ....

===Sudan===
According to the Beirut-based [[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|Al-Akhbar]] news site, conflict has been "simmering" between the two largest "religious sects" in [[Sudan]]—Salafis and Sufis.&lt;ref name=simmer/&gt;  
Al Jazeera estimates that more than 60% of Sudanese are affiliated with Sufism, while 10% are tied to Salafi groups, though that number is growing.&lt;ref name=sharif&gt;{{cite web|last=Al Sharif|first=Jamal|title=Salafis in Sudan:Non-Interference or Confrontation|url=http://studies.aljazeera.net/en/reports/2012/07/20127395530326675.htm|work=03 July 2012|publisher=AlJazeera Center for Studies|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Salafis, particularly the largest and oldest Salafi group Ansar al-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyyah, oppose Sufi beliefs and practices they find to be "heresies and perversions" and have been active preaching publicly against (what they believe are) unIslamic activities.  [[Afghan Arabs|Arab Afghan]] [[Salafist jihadism|Jihadist Salafists]] have also been active in Sudan since the 1990s, sometimes violently.&lt;ref name=sharif/&gt;
In January 2012 a fight broke out between Sufis celebrating the [[Mawlid|Prophet Mohammad’s birthday]] and salafis. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dozens of people were injured before the Sudanese police arrived at the scene to stop the fighting. Beyond the known differences between the two groups on the permissibility and religious legitimacy of the celebration, this specific clash took place in the context of rising tensions between the two groups [(Sufi and Salafi)], that arose after unknown persons dug up and burned the tomb of a Sufi on 2nd December 2011. The exhumed body was that of Sheikh Idris oud al-Arbab ...  The Sufi sects had accused the Salafi groups of desecrating and burning the tomb; the Salafis had denied any involvement, but the relationship between the two groups became increasingly tense leading up to the assault on the mawlid on 31st January 2012.&lt;ref name=sharif/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
Following this disturbance and complaints by Sufis, the Khartoum government announced a ban on Ansar al-Sunnah clerics preaching in public areas.  Several "Sufi domes and shrines" have also been destroyed in Sudan, something Ansar denies any involvement in.&lt;ref name=simmer&gt;[http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/5193 Salafis vs Sufis: A Simmering Conflict in Sudan]| May Ali| al-akhbar.com| 14 March 2012| accessed 27 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tunisia===
In an article on the rise of Salafism in Tunisia, the media site [[Al-Monitor]] reported that 39 Sufi shrines were destroyed or desecrated in Tunisia, from the 2011 revolution to January 2013.  The shrines, called zawaya, are mausoleums built to house the remains of ancient holy men.&lt;ref name=rise&gt;{{cite news|last=Benoit-Lavelle|first=Mischa|title=Tunisian Salafis on the Rise|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/01/amenas-hostages-ennahda-accused-tolerating-islamist-violence.html#ixzz2MAnEv8TU|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=al-monitor|date=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to journalists Peter Beaumont and Patrick Kingsley, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Salafist component in Tunisia remains a small minority, but it has prompted rows and mistrust among secularists and moderate Islamists. The Salafists are spread between three broad groups: new small political movements that have formed in recent months; non-violent Salafis; and violent Salafists and jihadists who, though small in number, have had a major impact in terms of violent attacks, arson on historic shrines or mausoleums considered to be unorthodox, demonstrations against art events ... and isolated incidents of attacking premises that sell alcohol outside Tunis.&lt;ref name=violent&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/09/violent-salafists-threaten-arab-spring-democracies Violent tide of Salafism threatens the Arab spring]| Peter Beaumont and Patrick Kingsley| The Observer| 9 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, Sufi leader Muhammad [[Hisham Kabbani]] is well known for his vocal criticism of Wahhabism.&lt;ref name=IFWP&gt;{{cite web|title=A resounding voice in traditional Islam: Shaykh Muhammad Hisham Kabbani.|work=October 1–14, 2002|publisher=Institute for World Politics|url=http://www.iwp.edu/news_publications/detail/a-resounding-voice-in-traditional-islam-sheik-muhammad-hisham-kabbani|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kabbani, who moved to the United States in 1990 as an emissary of his teacher, Shaykh Muhammad [[Nazim Al-Haqqani]], the grand shaykh of the [[Naqshbandi]] order, has described Wahhabism as being "like an octopus" because 'Its tentacles are reaching everywhere.' According to Kabbani, when he arrived in the US from Lebanon in 1990 he was shocked to hear Wahhabi doctrines being preached at Friday sermons. 'I asked myself: Is Wahhabism active in America? So I started my research. Whichever mosque I went to, it was Wahhabi, Wahhabi, Wahhabi, Wahhabi.'   In 1999, during a forum organised by the [[US Department of State]], Kabbani charged that '80 per cent' of the mosques in the US were run by extremists.&lt;ref name=defend&gt;{{cite web|title=A Sufi Muslim Takes on Wahhabism|url=http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.org/media-center/isca-in-the-news/35-a-sufi-muslim-takes-on-wahhabism.html|work=December 12, 2004,|publisher=Islamic Supreme Council of America|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Holy Science''''' is a book written by Swami [[Sri Yukteswar Giri]] in 1894 under the title '''''Kaivalya Darsanam'''''. Sri Yukteswar states that he wrote ''The Holy Science'' at the request of [[Mahavatar Babaji]].&lt;ref name=holy/&gt; The book compares parallel passages from the [[Bible]] and [[Upanishads]] in order to show the unity of all religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Cheryl|title=The Unmistakable Touch of Grace|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7432-2652-3|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhatt|first=Chetan|title=Liberation And Purity: Race, New Religious Movements and the Ethics of Postmodernity|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=978-1-85728-424-9|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of book==
In the introduction, Sri Yukteswar writes:
::The purpose of this book is to show as clearly as possible that there is an essential unity in all religions; that there is no difference in the truths inculcated by the various faiths; that there is but one method by which the world, both external and internal, has evolved; and that there is but one Goal admitted by all scriptures.&lt;ref name=holy&gt;{{cite book|last=Sri Yukteswar|first=Swami|title=The Holy Science|publisher=Yogoda Satsanga Society of India|year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  book compares [[Sanskrit]] slokas to passages from the [[New Testament]], especially the [[Book of Revelation]].

He states in the introduction: “The book is divided into four sections according to the four stages in the development of knowledge.” The four sections are:
:*'''The Gospel:''' “…seeks to establish the fundamental truth of creation, and to describe the evolution and the involution of the world.”
:*'''The Goal:''' “All creatures, from the highest to the lowest in the link of creation, are found eager to realize three things – Existence, Consciousness, and Bliss.”
:*'''The Procedure:''' “…deals with the method of realizing the three purposes of life.”
:*'''The Revelation:''' “…discusses the revelations which come to those who have traveled far to realize the three ideals of life and are very near their destination.”&lt;ref name=holy/&gt;

Sri Yukteswar’s introduction to ''The Holy Science'' includes his explanation of the [[Yuga]] Cycle which differs from the traditional position because of his premise that the earth is now in the age of [[Dwapara Yuga]], not the [[Kali Yuga]] that most Indian pundits believe to be the current age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cruttenden|first=Walter|title=Lost Star of Myth and Time|publisher=St. Lynn's Press|year=2005|pages=50–51|isbn=978-0-9767631-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory is based on the idea that the sun “takes some star for its dual and revolves round it in about 24,000 years of our earth – a celestial phenomenon which causes the backward movement of the equinoctial points around the zodiac.”&lt;ref name=holy/&gt;
The common explanation for this celestial phenomenon is [[precession]], the ‘wobbling’ rotating movement of the earth axis. Research into Sri Yukteswar’s explanation is being conducted by the Binary Research Institute.

He further states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The sun also has another motion by which it revolves round a grand center called Vishnu-Naabhi which is the seat of the creative power Brahma, the universal magnetism. Brahma regulates Dharma the mental virtues of the internal world. When the sun in its revolution round its dual come to the place nearest to this grand center the seat of Brahma (an event which takes place when the autumnal equinox comes to the first point of Aries) Dharma the mental virtue becomes so much developed that man can easily comprehend all, even the mysteries of Spirit.&lt;ref name=holy/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''The Holy Science'', Sri Yukteswar concludes that we are currently in the beginning stages of Dwapara Yuga, which began around 1699 A.D., moving closer to the grand center, and will pass into [[Treta Yuga]] around the year 4099 A.D.&lt;ref name=holy/&gt;

If we represent the Yugas in a clock, the lowest spiritual time would be at 6 o'clock, approx. year 550 A.D., which is the center of Kali Yuga (more or less the Middle Ages), and the highest point is 12 o'clock, in the center of Satya Yuga (literally Age of Truth, as sat=truth), or Golden Age. It takes approx. 12,000 years from the lowest to the highest point, and about 24,000 in a complete turn. Now we would be at approx. 7 c'clock, ascending in Dwapara Yuga or Bronze Age which started in 1699. [[File:Yugas-Ages-based-on-Sri-Yukteswar.png|right|300px|The 4 spiritual ages or ''yugas'': [[Satya Yuga|satya]], [[Treta Yuga|treta]], [[Dwapára Yuga|dwapára]] y [[Kali-Yuga|kali]]]]

[Note:  The graphic to the right displays the Zodiac symbols in its inner circle based on their alignment with the Northern Hemisphere AUTUMNAL Equinox, NOT the Vernal Equinox. This is because the Great Year/Yuga Cycle commences when the Autumnal Equinox is aligned with the First Point of the Constellation Aries as stated above (ref "The Holy Science" by Sri Yukteswar). Hence they may appear to be rotated 180 degrees to those who normally use the Northern Hemisphere VERNAL Equinox as their reference point for the Zodiac 'Ages']

==Biography==
[[File:Buddha Hall 105.JPG|thumb|left|Buddha hall of the Từ Hiếu Pagoda]]
{{Zen Buddhism}}
Born as Nguyễn Xuân Bảo, Nhất Hạnh was born in the city of [[Huế]] in [[Central Vietnam]] in 1926. At the age of 16 he entered the monastery at nearby Từ Hiếu Temple, where his primary teacher was [[Zen Master]] Thanh Quý Chân Thật.&lt;ref name="Dung, Thay Phap 2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orderofinterbeing.org/docs/TNH-Tradition-Lineage.pdf |title=A Letter to Friends about our Lineage |author=Dung, Thay Phap |year=2006 |work=PDF file on the Order of Interbeing website |publisher= |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woodmoorvillage.org/2005/08/the_tu_hieu_lin.html |title=The Tu Hieu Lineage of Thien (Zen) Buddhism |author=Cordova, Nathaniel |year=2005 |work=Blog entry on the Woodmore Village website |publisher= |accessdate=September 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112210158/http://www.woodmoorvillage.org/2005/08/the_tu_hieu_lin.html |archive-date=2013-01-12 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interbeing.org.uk/teachers/thay.html |title=Thich Nhat Hanh |date= |work= |publisher=Published on the Community of Interbeing, UK website  |accessdate=September 13, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080102023137/http://www.interbeing.org.uk/teachers/thay.html |archivedate = January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A graduate of [[Báo Quốc Pagoda|Báo Quốc]] Buddhist Academy in Central Vietnam, Thích Nhất Hạnh received training in Vietnamese traditions of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, as well as [[Vietnamese Thiền]], and received full ordination as a [[Bhikkhu]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thuvienhoasen.org/a8173/tieu-su-hoa-thuong-thich-don-hau|title=Tiểu Sử Hòa Thượng Thích Đôn Hậu|last=Bổn|first=Thích Đồng|date=December 23, 2010|website=Thư Viện Hoa Sen|language=Vietnamese|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 20, 2018|quote=...in 1951 when he was transmission master at An Quang temple, in that transmission ceremony Ven. Nhật Liên, Ven. Nhất Hạnh…. were ordinees.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 Nhất Hạnh was named editor-in-chief of ''Vietnamese Buddhism'', the periodical of the Unified Vietnam Buddhist Association ({{lang-vi|Giáo Hội Phật Giáo Việt Nam Thống Nhất}}). In the following years he founded Lá Bối Press, the [[Vạn Hạnh Zen Temple|Vạn Hanh]] Buddhist University in [[Saigon]], and the School of Youth for Social Service (SYSS); a neutral corps of Buddhist peaceworkers who went into rural areas to establish schools, build healthcare clinics, and help rebuild villages.&lt;ref name = "BBC"/&gt;

Nhất Hạnh is now recognized as a dharmacharya (teacher), and as the spiritual head of the Từ Hiếu Pagoda and associated monasteries.&lt;ref name="Dung, Thay Phap 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mau, Thich Chi (1999) "Application for the publication of books and sutras", letter to the Vietnamese Governmental Committee of Religious Affairs, re-printed on the Plum Village website. He is the Elder of the Từ Hiếu branch of the 8th generation of the Liễu Quán lineage in the 42nd generation of the [[Linji school]] ([[wikt:臨|臨]] [[wikt:濟|濟]] [[wikt:禪|禪]], {{lang-vi|Lâm Tế}})&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 1966 at Từ Hiếu Temple, he received the "lamp transmission", making him a dharmacharya, from Zen Master Chân Thật.&lt;ref name="Dung, Thay Phap 2006"/&gt;

===During the Vietnam War===

In 1961 Nhất Hạnh went to the US to teach [[comparative religion]] at [[Princeton University]],&lt;ref name="lionsroar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Andrea|title=Peace in Every Step|url=http://www.lionsroar.com/headline-july-2010/|publisher=[[Lion's Roar (magazine)|Lion's Roar]]|date=September 30, 2016|accessdate=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently appointed lecturer in Buddhism at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="lionsroar"/&gt; By then he had gained fluency in [[French language|French]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[English language|English]], in addition to his native [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. In 1963, he returned to Vietnam to aid his fellow monks in their non-violent peace efforts.&lt;ref name="lionsroar"/&gt;

Nhất Hạnh taught [[Buddhist psychology]] and [[prajnaparamita]] literature at Vạn Hanh Buddhist University, a private institution that taught Buddhist studies, Vietnamese culture, and languages.&lt;ref name="lionsroar"/&gt; At a meeting in April 1965, Vạn Hanh Union students issued a ''Call for Peace'' statement. It declared: "It is time for North and South Vietnam to find a way to stop the war and help all Vietnamese people live peacefully and with mutual respect." Nhất Hạnh left for the U.S. shortly afterwards, leaving Chân Không in charge of the SYSS. Vạn Hạnh University was taken over by one of the Chancellors who wished to sever ties with Thich Nhất Hạnh and the SYSS, accusing Chân Không of being a [[communism|communist]]. From that point the SYSS struggled to raise funds and faced attacks on its members. The SYSS persisted in their relief efforts without taking sides in the conflict.&lt;ref name="giaodiem"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.giaodiemonline.com/thuvien/FotoNews/nh_quannhu.htm |title=Nhat Hanh's Peace Activities" in "Vietnamese Engaged Buddhism: The Struggle Movement of 1963–66" |author=Nhu, Quan |year=2002 |work=Reprinted on the Giao Diem si |publisher= |accessdate=September 13, 2010}} (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nhất Hạnh returned to the US in 1966 to lead a symposium in [[Vietnamese Buddhism]] at [[Cornell University]], and to continue his work for peace. While in the US, Nhất Hạnh stopped at [[Gethsemani Abbey]] to speak with [[Thomas Merton]].&lt;ref name="talking"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zahn |first=Max|title=Talking Buddha, Talking Christ|url=http://www.tricycle.com/blog/talking-buddha-talking-christ/|publisher=[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]]|date=September 30, 2015|accessdate=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Vietnam threatened to block Nhất Hạnh's re-entry to the country, Merton penned an essay of solidarity entitled "Nhat Hanh is my Brother".&lt;ref name="talking"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nhat Hanh is my Brother|url=http://www.buddhistdoor.net/features/nhat-hanh-is-my-brother|publisher=Buddhist Door|date=May 1, 2011|accessdate=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had written a letter to [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in 1965 entitled: "In Search of the Enemy of Man". It was during his 1966 stay in the US that Nhất Hạnh met with King and urged him to publicly denounce the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aavw.org/protest/king_journey_abstract09.html |title=Searching for the Enemy of Man" in Nhat Nanh, Ho Huu Tuong, Tam Ich, Bui Giang, Pham Cong Thien |date=1965 |pages=11–20 |work=Dialogue |publisher=Saigon: La Boi |accessdate=September 13, 2010}}, Archived on the African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War website&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Dr. King gave a famous speech at the [[Riverside Church]] in New York City, his first to publicly question the U.S. involvement in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aavw.org/special_features/speeches_speech_king01.html |title=Beyond Vietnam |author=Speech made by Martin Luther King, Jr. at the Riverside Church, NYC |date=April 4, 1967 |work= |publisher=Archived on the African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War website |accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Dr. King nominated Nhất Hạnh for the 1967 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. In his nomination Dr. King said, "I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of [this prize] than this gentle monk from Vietnam. His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to [[ecumenism]], to world brotherhood, to humanity".&lt;ref name="nomination"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/025.html |title=Nomination of Thich Nhat Hanh for the Nobel Peace Prize |author=King, Martin Luther, Jr. (letter) |date=January 25, 1967 |work= |publisher=Archived on the Hartford Web Publishing website |accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that King had revealed the candidate he had chosen to nominate and had made a "strong request" to the prize committee, was in sharp violation of the Nobel traditions and protocol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/shortfacts.html Nobel Prize Official website "Facts on the Nobel Peace Prize.] "The names of the nominees cannot be revealed until 50 years later, but the Nobel Peace Prize committee does reveal the number of nominees each year."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nomination/peace/process.html Nobel Prize website – Nomination Process] "The statutes of the Nobel Foundation restrict disclosure of information about the nominations, whether publicly or privately, for 50 years. The restriction concerns the nominees and nominators, as well as investigations and opinions related to the award of a prize."&lt;/ref&gt; The committee did not make an award that year.

Nhất Hạnh moved to France and became the chair of the Vietnamese Buddhist Peace Delegation.&lt;ref name="lionsroar"/&gt; When the Northern Vietnamese army took control of the south in 1975, he was denied permission to return to Vietnam.&lt;ref name="lionsroar"/&gt; From 1976–1977 he led efforts to help rescue [[Vietnamese boat people]] in the [[Gulf of Thailand|Gulf of Siam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinfels|first=Peter|title=At a Retreat, a Zen Monk Plants the Seeds of Peace|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/us/at-a-retreat-a-zen-monk-plants-the-seeds-of-peace.html|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 19, 1993|accessdate=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually stopping under pressure from the governments of [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.integrativespirituality.org/postnuke/html/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=printpage&amp;artid=308 |title=Thich Nhat Hanh |author=Author and date unknown |date= |work= |publisher=Article on the Integrative Spirituality website |accessdate=September 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522171810/http://www.integrativespirituality.org/postnuke/html/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=printpage&amp;artid=308 |archivedate=May 22, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[CIA]] document from the Vietnam War has called Thích Nhất Hạnh a "[[brain trust]]er" of [[Thích Trí Quang|Thich Tri Quang]], the leader of a dissident group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/virtualarchive/items.php?item=04109128007] The Vietnam Center and Archive: "Situation Appraisal of Buddhism as a Political Force During Current Election Period Extending through September 1967"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishing the Order of Interbeing===
[[File:Deer Park Monastery4.jpg|thumb|[[Deer Park Monastery]] in [[California]]]]

Nhất Hạnh created the [[Order of Interbeing]] in 1966. He heads this monastic and lay group, teaching Five Mindfulness Trainings and the Fourteen Precepts. In 1969 he established the [[Unified Buddhist Church]] (Église Bouddhique Unifiée) in France (not a part of the [[Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam]]).  In 1975 he formed the Sweet Potato Meditation Center. The center grew and in 1982 he and his colleague Chân Không founded [[Plum Village]], a [[vihara]]{{efn-ua|Buddhist monastery and [[zen center]]; a secluded retreat originally intended for wandering monks}} in the Dordogne in the south of France.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/people/thichnhathanh.shtml |title=Religion &amp; Ethics – Thich Nhat Hanh |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Unified Buddhist Church is the legally recognized governing body for Plum Village in France, for [[Blue Cliff Monastery]] in [[Pine Bush, New York|Pine Bush]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Community of Mindful Living]], [[Parallax Press]], [[Deer Park Monastery]] in [[California]], [[Magnolia Village Practice Center|Magnolia Village]] in [[Batesville, Mississippi]], and the European Institute of Applied Buddhism in [[Waldbröl]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamhome.org/community.php|title=Information about Practice Centers from the official Community of Mindful Living site|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=March 9, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224034810/http://www.iamhome.org/community.php|archivedate=February 24, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eiab.eu/about/ |title=About the European Institute of Applied Buddhism |author=webteam |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He established two monasteries in Vietnam, at the original Từ Hiếu Temple near [[Huế]] and at Prajna Temple in the central highlands. Thích Nhất Hạnh and the [[Order of Interbeing]] have established monasteries and Dharma centers in the United States at Deer Park Monastery (Tu Viện Lộc Uyển) in [[Escondido, California]], Maple Forest Monastery (Tu Viện Rừng Phong) and Green Mountain Dharma Center (Ðạo Tràng Thanh Sơn) in [[Vermont]] and [[Magnolia Village Practice Center]] (Đạo Tràng Mộc Lan) in [[Mississippi]], the second of which closed in 2007 and moved to the [[Blue Cliff Monastery]] in [[Pine Bush, New York|Pine Bush]], [[New York (state)|New York]] . These monasteries are open to the public during much of the year and provide ongoing retreats for laypersons. The Order of Interbeing also holds retreats for specific groups of lay people, such as families, teenagers, veterans, the entertainment industry, members of Congress, law enforcement officers and people of color.&lt;ref name="deerparkmonastery.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deerparkmonastery.org| title=A Practice Center in the Tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh| work=deerparkmonastery.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deerparkmonastery.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colorsofcompassionmovie.com/ |title=Colors of Compassion is a documentary film  |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faithandpolitics.org/?q=thich_nhat |title=Article: '&amp;#39;Thich Nhat Hahn Leads Retreat for Members of Congress'&amp;#39; (2004) Faith and Politics Institute website |publisher=Faithandpolitics.org |date=May 14, 2013 |accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Frank Bures |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0925/p15s01-lire.html |title=Bures, Frank (2003) '&amp;#39;Zen and the Art of Law Enforcement'&amp;#39; – '&amp;#39;Christian Science Monitor'&amp;#39; |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date= |accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nhất Hạnh conducted a peace walk in Los Angeles in 2005, and again in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=83,5218,0,0,1,0 |title="Thich Nhat Hanh on Burma", Buddhist Channel, accessed 11/5/2007 |publisher=Buddhistchannel.tv |date=October 20, 2007 |accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Vietnam===
[[File:Thich Nhat Hanh in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Thích Nhất Hạnh during a ceremony in [[Da Nang]] on his 2007 trip to [[Vietnam]]]]

In 2005, following lengthy negotiations,  Nhất Hạnh was given permission from the Vietnamese government to return for a visit. He was also allowed to teach there, publish four of his books in Vietnamese, and travel the country with monastic and lay members of his Order, including a return to his root temple, Tu Hieu Temple in [[Huế]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,501050124-1018137,00.html |title=A Long Journey Home |author=Johnson, Kay |work= |publisher=Time Asia Magazine (online version) |accessdate=September 13, 2010 |date=January 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=2,627,0,0,1,0 |title=Local Buddhist Monks Return to Vietnam as Part of Historic Trip |author=Warth, Gary |year=2005 |work= |publisher=North County Times (re-published on the Buddhist Channel news website) |accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trip was not without controversy. Thich Vien Dinh, writing on behalf of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (considered illegal by the Vietnamese government), called for Nhất Hạnh to make a statement against the Vietnam government's poor record on religious freedom. Thich Vien Dinh feared that the trip would be used as propaganda by the Vietnamese government, suggesting to the world that religious freedom is improving there, while abuses continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=1,686,0,0,1,0 |title=Buddhist monk requests Thich Nhat Hanh to see true situation in Vietnam |year=2005 |work=Letter from Thich Vien Dinh as reported by the Buddhist Channel news website |publisher=Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, 2005 |accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51535.htm |title=Vietnam: International Religious Freedom Report |year=2005 |work= |publisher=U.S. State Department |accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1995/Vietnam.htm |title=Vietnam: The Suppression of the Unified Buddhist Church |author1=Kenneth Roth |author2=executive director |year=1995 |work=Vol.7, No.4 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the controversy, Thích Nhất Hạnh again returned to Vietnam in 2007, while two senior officials of the banned [[Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam]] (UBCV) remained under house arrest. The Unified Buddhist Church called his visit a betrayal, symbolizing his willingness to work with his co-religionists' oppressors. Võ Văn Ái, a spokesman for the UBCV, said "I believe Thích Nhất Hạnh's trip is manipulated by the Hanoi government to hide its repression of the Unified Buddhist Church and create a false impression of religious freedom in Vietnam."&lt;ref name="time2"/&gt; The Plum Village Website states that the three goals of his 2007 trip back to Vietnam were to support new monastics in his Order; to organize and conduct "Great Chanting Ceremonies" intended to help heal remaining wounds from the Vietnam War; and to lead retreats for monastics and lay people. The chanting ceremonies were originally called "[[Liberation Rite of Water and Land|Grand Requiem for Praying Equally for All to Untie the Knots of Unjust Suffering]]", but Vietnamese officials objected, saying it was unacceptable for the government to "equally" pray for soldiers in the South Vietnamese army or U.S. soldiers.  Nhất Hạnh agreed to change the name to "Grand Requiem For Praying".&lt;ref name="time2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1595721,00.html |title=The Fighting Monks of Vietnam |author=Johnson, Kay  |work= |publisher=Time Magazine (online version Retrieved July 3, 2007) |accessdate=September 13, 2010 |date=March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
In 2014, major Anglican, Catholic, and Orthodox Christian leaders, as well as Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist leaders, met to sign a shared commitment against modern-day slavery; the declaration they signed calls for the elimination of slavery and human trafficking by the year 2020.

===Health===
In November 2014, Nhất Hạnh experienced a severe [[Stroke#Hemorrhagic|brain hemorrhage]] and was hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plumvillage.org/news/our-beloved-teacher-in-hospital/ |title=Our Beloved Teacher in Hospital |accessdate=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/thich-nhat-hanh-hospitalized-severe-brain-hemorrhage/|title=Thich Nhat Hanh Hospitalized for Severe Brain Hemorrhage |publisher=[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]]|date=November 13, 2014|accessdate=November 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After months of rehabilitation, Nhất Hạnh was released from the stroke rehabilitation clinic at [[Bordeaux Segalen University|Bordeaux University Hospital]], in France. On July 11, 2015, Nhất Hạnh was flown to San Francisco to speed his recovery with an aggressive rehabilitation program through UCSF Medical Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plumvillage.org/news/an-update-on-thays-health-14th-july-2015/ |title=An Update on Thay's Health: 14th July 2015|publisher=[[Plum Village]]|accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to France on January 8, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Update on Thay's Health: 8th January 2016|url=http://plumvillage.org/news/an-update-on-thays-health-8th-january-2016/|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending 2016 in France, Nhất Hạnh traveled to Thai Plum Village.&lt;ref name="92birthday"&gt;{{cite web|title=On his 92nd birthday, a Thich Nhat Hanh post-stroke update|url=https://www.lionsroar.com/on-his-92nd-birthday-a-thich-nhat-hanh-post-stroke-update/|publisher=[[Lion's Roar (magazine)|Lion's Roar]]|date=October 11, 2018|accessdate=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has continued to see both Eastern and Western specialists while in Thailand.&lt;ref name="92birthday"/&gt; He is still unable to speak.&lt;ref name="92birthday"/&gt;

On November 2, 2018, a press release from the Plum Village community confirmed that Nhất Hạnh, now aged 92, had returned to Vietnam a final time and would reside at Từ Hiếu Temple to "live his remaining days". In a meeting with senior disciples, he had "clearly communicated his wish to return to Vietnam using gestures, nodding and shaking his head in response to questions."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Approach==
[[File:Thich Nhat Hanh2.jpg|thumb|left|Thích Nhất Hạnh in [[Vught]], the [[Netherlands]], 2006]]

Thích Nhất Hạnh's approach has been to combine a variety of teachings of [[Early Buddhism]], Mahayana Buddhist traditions of [[Yogachara|Yogācāra]] and [[Zen]], and ideas from Western psychology to teach [[Mindfulness of breathing|Mindfulness of Breathing]] and the [[Four foundations of mindfulness|Four Establishments of Mindfulness]], offering a modern light on meditation practice. Hạnh's presentation of the [[Prajnaparamita]] in terms of "interbeing" has doctrinal antecedents in the [[Huayan school]] of thought,&lt;ref&gt;McMahan, David L. ''The Making of Buddhist Modernism''. Oxford University Press: 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-19-518327-6}} pg 158&lt;/ref&gt; which "is often said to provide a philosophical foundation" for Zen.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'' 2nd ed.Taylor &amp; Francis, 1989, page 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Nhất Hạnh has also been a leader in the [[Engaged Buddhism]] movement&lt;ref name="mindfulnessbell"/&gt; (he is credited with coining the term&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duerr|first=Maya|title=An Introduction to Engaged Buddhism|url=http://www.pbs.org/thebuddha/blog/2010/Mar/26/introduction-engaged-buddhism-maia-duerr/|publisher=[[PBS]]|date=March 26, 2010|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), promoting the individual's active role in creating change. He cites the 13th-century Vietnamese king [[Trần Nhân Tông]] with the origination of the concept. Trần Nhân Tông abdicated his throne to become a monk and founded the Vietnamese Buddhist school of the Bamboo Forest tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt-Perry|first1=Patricia|last2=Fine|first2=Lyn|editor-last=Queen |editor-first=Christopher S.|contribution = All Buddhism is Engaged: Thich Nhat Hanh and the Order of Interbeing|title=Engaged Buddhism in the West|pages=36-37|publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]]|ISBN=978-0861711598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names applied to him==
[[File:Thich Nhat Hanh.JPG|thumb|Nhất Hạnh at [[Phu Bai International Airport]] on his 2007 trip to Vietnam (aged 80)]]

The [[Vietnamese name]] ''Thích'' ([[wikt:釋|釋]]) is from "Thích Ca" or "Thích Già" ([[wikt:釋迦|釋迦]]), means "of the [[Shakya]] clan".&lt;ref name="Dung, Thay Phap 2006"/&gt; All Buddhist monastics in [[East Asian Buddhism]] adopt this name as their [[surname]], implying that their first family is the Buddhist community. In many Buddhist traditions, there is a progression of names that a person can receive. The first, the lineage name, is given when a person takes [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] in the [[Three Jewels]]. Thích Nhất Hạnh's lineage name is '''Trừng Quang''' (澄光), meaning "Clear, Reflective Light". The next is a [[Dharma name]], given when a person, lay or monastic, takes additional vows or when one is ordained as a monastic. Thích Nhất Hạnh's Dharma name is '''Phùng Xuân''' (逢春), meaning "Meeting Spring". Additionally, Dharma titles are sometimes given, and Thích Nhất Hạnh's Dharma title is '''Nhất Hạnh'''.&lt;ref name="Dung, Thay Phap 2006"/&gt;

Neither ''Nhất'' ([[wikt:一|一]]) nor ''Hạnh'' ([[wikt:行|行]])—which approximate the roles of middle name or intercalary name and [[given name]], respectively, when referring to him in English—was part of his name at birth. ''Nhất'' (一) means "one", implying "first-class", or "of best quality"; ''Hạnh'' (行) means "action", implying "[[Noble Eightfold Path#Ethical conduct|right conduct]]" or "good nature."  Thích Nhất Hạnh has translated his Dharma names as Nhất = One, and Hạnh = Action. [[Vietnamese name]]s follow this naming convention, placing the family or surname first, then the middle or intercalary name which often refers to the person's position in the family or generation, followed by the given name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/1044 |title=Vietnamese Names |author=Geotravel Research Center, Kissimmee, Florida |year=1995 |work=Excerpted from "Culture Briefing: Vietnam" |publisher=Things Asian website |accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thích Nhất Hạnh is often referred to as {{lang|vi|Thầy}} "master; teacher" or as ''Thầy'' Nhất Hạnh by his followers. Any Vietnamese monk or nun in the Mahayana tradition can be addressed as "thầy". Vietnamese Buddhist monks are addressed ''thầy tu'' "monk" and nuns are addressed as ''sư cô'' "sister" or ''sư bà'' "elder sister". On the Vietnamese version of the Plum Village website, he is also referred to as Thiền Sư Nhất Hạnh "Zen Master Nhất Hạnh".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.langmai.org/ |title=Title attributed to TNH on the Vietnamese Plum Village site |language=vi|publisher=Langmai.org |date=December 31, 2011 |accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
[[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] nominated Thích Nhất Hạnh for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="nomination" /&gt; However, the prize was not awarded to anybody that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts on the Nobel Peace Prize|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/shortfacts.html|publisher=Nobel Media|accessdate=August 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805081742/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/shortfacts.html|archive-date=August 5, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nhất Hạnh was awarded the Courage of Conscience award in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peaceabbey.org/awards/cocrecipientlist.html The Peace Abbey – Courage of Conscience Recipients List] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214172308/http://www.peaceabbey.org/awards/cocrecipientlist.html |date=February 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been featured in many films, including ''[[The Power of Forgiveness]]'' shown at the [[Dawn Breakers International Film Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dbiff.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=20 |title=First line up |date=December 5, 2009 |work= |publisher=Dawn Breakers International Film Festival (DBIFF) |accessdate=September 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310194437/http://dbiff.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=20 |archive-date=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2017 documentary ''Walk with Me''

In November 2017, the [[Education University of Hong Kong]] conferred an honorary doctorate upon Thích Nhất Hạnh for his "life-long contributions to the promotion of mindfulness, peace and happiness across the world". As Nhất Hạnh was unable to attend the congregation in Hong Kong, a simple ceremony was held on 29 August 2017 in Thailand, where Professor John Lee Chi-kin, Vice President (Academic) of EdUHK, presented the honorary degree certificate and academic gown to Nhất Hạnh on behalf of the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eduhk.hk/main/media/press-release/816|title=The Education University of Hong Kong (EduHK) Press Release|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/EdUHK.hk/posts/1902646863385634|title=The Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK) Facebook|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''transcendence''' conveys the basic ground concept from the word's literal meaning (from [[Latin]]), of climbing or going beyond, albeit with varying connotations in its different historical and cultural stages. It includes [[philosophies]], systems, and approaches that describe the fundamental structures of being, not as an [[ontology]] (theory of being), but as the framework of emergence and validation of [[knowledge]] of being. "Transcendental" is a word derived from the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]], designating the extra-categorical attributes of beings.&lt;ref name="transcendental"&gt;Caygill, Howard. ''A Kant Dictionary''. (Blackwell Philosopher Dictionaries), Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2000, p. 398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catholic"&gt;Turner, W. (1912). Transcendentalism. In ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. New York: Robert Appleton Company. &lt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15017a.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Religious definition==
{{See also|Transcendence (religion)}}
In [[religion]], transcendence refers to the aspect of a god's nature and power which is wholly independent of the material universe, beyond all physical laws. This is contrasted with [[immanence]], where a god is said to be fully present in the physical world and thus accessible to creatures in various ways. In [[religious experience]] transcendence is a state of being that has overcome the limitations of physical existence and by some definitions has also become independent of it. This is typically manifested in [[prayer]], [[séance]], [[meditation]], [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]s and [[paranormal]] "visions".

It is affirmed in various religious traditions' concept of the [[divinity|divine]], which contrasts with the notion of a [[god]] (or, the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]) that exists exclusively in the physical order (immanentism), or indistinguishable from it ([[pantheism]]). Transcendence can be attributed to the divine not only in its being, but also in its knowledge. Thus, a god may transcend both the universe and knowledge (is beyond the grasp of the human mind).

Although transcendence is defined as the opposite of immanence, the two are not necessarily [[mutually exclusive]]. Some [[theology|theologians]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysicians]] of various religious traditions affirm that a god is both within and beyond the universe ([[panentheism]]); in it, but not of it; simultaneously pervading it and surpassing it.

==Modern philosophy==
{{Further|Transcendental idealism|Transcendental arguments}}

In [[modern philosophy]], [[Immanuel Kant]] introduced a new term — ''transcendental'', thus instituting a new, third meaning. In his [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]], this concept is concerned with the [[condition of possibility]] of knowledge itself. He also opposed the term ''transcendental'' to the term ''transcendent'', the latter meaning "that which goes beyond" (transcends) any possible knowledge of a human being.&lt;ref&gt;cf. ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' or ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume 2, Chapter 10, § 141, [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] presented the difference between transcendent and immanent in the form of a dialogue. The dialogists were Thrasymachos, a student of [[German idealism|German Idealism]], and Philalethes, a [[Transcendental idealism|Kantian Transcendental Idealist]]. "Thrasymachos: …I know these expressions from my professor, but only as predicates of a loving God with whom his philosophy was exclusively concerned, as is only right and proper. Namely, if God is situated within the world, he is immanent; if he resides somewhere outside, he is transcendent. … Philalethes: Transcendent knowledge is that which, going beyond all possibility of experience, strives to determine the nature of things as they are in themselves; immanent knowledge, on the other hand, is that which keeps within the bounds of the possibility of experience, but thus can speak only of phenomena." In Schopenhauer’s German: "Thrasymachos: …Mir sind diese Ausdrücke zwar auch bekannt, von meinem Professor her, aber nur als Prädikate des lieben Gottes, mit welchem seine Philosophie, wie sich das eben auch geziemt, es ausschließlich zu tun hatte. Steckt nämlich der in der Welt drinne, so ist er immanent: sitzt er aber irgendwo draußen, so ist er transzendent….Philalethes: Transzendente Erkenntnis ist die, welche, über alle Möglichkeit der Erfahrung hinausgehend, das Wesen der Dinge, wie sie an sich selbst sind, zu bestimmen anstrebt; immanente Erkenntnis hingegen die, welche sich innerhalb der Schranken der Möglichkeit der Erfahrung hält, daher aber auch nur von Erscheinungen reden kann."&lt;/ref&gt; For him ''transcendental'' meant knowledge about our cognitive faculty with regard to how objects are possible ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. "I call all knowledge ''transcendental'' if it is occupied, not with objects, but with the way that we can possibly know objects even before we experience them."&lt;ref&gt;"I call all cognition transcendental that is occupied not so much with objects but rather with our mode of cognition of objects insofar as this is to be possible ''a priori''. A '''system''' of such concepts would be called '''transcendental philosophy'''." Kant, Immanuel. ''Critique of Pure Reason''. Edited and translated by [[Paul Guyer]] and Allen Wood, Cambridge University Press, 1998. p. 149 (B25)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[metaphysics]], as a fundamental and universal theory, turns out to be an [[epistemology]]. Transcendental philosophy, consequently, is not considered a traditional ontological form of metaphysics.

Kant also equated ''transcendental'' with that which is "...in respect of the subject's faculty of cognition."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'', Introduction, V&lt;/ref&gt; Something is transcendental if it plays a role in the way in which the mind "constitutes" objects and makes it possible for us to experience them as objects in the first place. Ordinary knowledge is knowledge of objects; transcendental knowledge is knowledge of how it is possible for us to experience those objects as objects. This is based on Kant's acceptance of [[David Hume]]'s argument that certain general features of objects (e.g. persistence, causal relationships) cannot be derived from the sense impressions we have of them. Kant argues that the mind must contribute those features and make it possible for us to experience objects as objects. In the central part of his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', the "Transcendental Deduction of the Categories", Kant argues for a deep interconnection between the ability to have self-consciousness and the ability to experience a world of objects. Through a process of synthesis, the mind generates both the structure of objects and its own unity.

A metaphilosophical question discussed by many Kantian scholars is how transcendental reflection is itself possible. Stephen Palmquist interprets Kant's appeal to [[faith]] as his most effective solution to this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, "Faith as Kant's Key to the Justification of Transcendental Reflection", The Heythrop Journal 25:4 (October 1984), pp.442-455. A revised version of this paper appeared as Chapter V in Palmquist's book, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1 Kant's System of Perspectives] (Lanham: University Press of America, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Kant, the "transcendent", as opposed to the "transcendental", is that which lies beyond what our faculty of knowledge can legitimately know. [[Hegel]]'s counter-argument to Kant was that to know a boundary is also to be aware of what it bounds and as such what lies beyond it &amp;ndash; in other words, to have already transcended it.

==Contemporary philosophy==
In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the "transcendent" is that which transcends our own consciousness: that which is objective rather than only a phenomenon of consciousness. [[Noema]] is employed in phenomenology to refer to the terminus of an intention as given for [[consciousness]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] also speaks of transcendence in his works. In ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', Sartre uses transcendence to describe the relation of the self to the object oriented world, as well as our concrete relations with others. For Sartre, the [[Pour soi|for-itself]] is sometimes called a transcendence. Additionally if the other is viewed strictly as an object, much like any other object, then the other is, for the for-itself, a transcendence-transcended. When the for-itself grasps the other in the others world, and grasps the subjectivity that the other has, it is referred to as transcending-transcendence. Thus, Sartre defines relations with others in terms of transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, Jean-Paul. Being and Nothingness. Trans. Hazel E. Barnes. New York: Washington Square Press, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary transcendental philosophy is developed by German philosopher [[Harald Holz]] with a holistic approach. Holz liberated transcendental philosophy from the convergence of [[neo-Kantianism]], he critically discussed transcendental pragmatism and the relation between transcendental philosophy, [[neo-empiricism]] and the so-called [[postmodernism]].

==Colloquial usage==
In everyday language, "transcendence" means "going beyond", and "self-transcendence" means going beyond a prior form or state of oneself. [[Mystical]] experience is thought of as a particularly advanced state of self-transcendence, in which the sense of a separate self is abandoned. "[[Self-transcendence]]" is believed to be psychometrically measurable, and (at least partially) inherited, and has been incorporated as a personality dimension in the [[Temperament and Character Inventory]].&lt;ref name=Cloninger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cloninger|first=C.R.|title=A psychobiological model of temperament and character|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|date=December 1993|volume=50|issue=12|pages=975–90|pmid=8250684|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1993.01820240059008|last2=Svrakic|first2=DM|last3=Przybeck|first3=TR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of this is described in the book "The God Gene" by [[Dean Hamer]], although this has been criticized by commentators such as [[Carl Zimmer]].

extremely changeable. An ancient statue of Venus, for example, stood in a different traditional context with the Greeks, who made it an object of veneration, than with the clerics of the Middle Ages, who viewed it as an ominous idol. Both of them, however, were equally confronted with its uniqueness, that is, its aura." [''Die Einzigkeit des Kunstwerks ist identisch mit seinem Eingebettetsein in den Zusammenhang der Tradition. Diese Tradition selber ist freilich etwas durchaus Lebendiges, etwas außerordentlich Wandelbares. Eine antike Venusstatue z.

'''Walter Bendix Schönflies Benjamin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|n|j|ə|m|ɪ|n}}; {{IPA-de|ˈvaltɐ ˈbɛnjamiːn|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Duden Aussprachewörterbuch | edition=6 | year=2006 | publisher=Bibliographisches Institut &amp; F.A. Brockhaus AG | location=Mannheim}}&lt;/ref&gt; 15 July 1892 – 26 September 1940)&lt;ref name=Witte&gt;{{cite book|last=Witte|first=Bernd|title=Walter Benjamin: An Intellectual Biography (English translation)|year=1991|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Detroit, MI|isbn=0-8143-2018-X|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was a [[German Jewish]] philosopher, [[cultural critic]] and [[essayist]]. An eclectic thinker, combining elements of [[German idealism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Western Marxism]], and [[Jewish mysticism]], Benjamin made enduring and influential contributions to [[Aesthetics|aesthetic theory]], [[literary criticism]], and [[historical materialism]]. He was associated with the [[Frankfurt School]], and also maintained formative friendships with thinkers such as [[playwright]] [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kabbalah]] scholar [[Gershom Scholem]]. He was also related by law to [[Germans|German]] [[political theory|political theorist]] and philosopher [[Hannah Arendt]] through her first marriage to Benjamin's cousin, [[Günther Anders]].

Among Benjamin's best known works are the essays "The Task of the Translator" (1923), "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1936), and "[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]" (1940). His major work as a literary critic included essays on [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Kraus]], [[Nikolai Leskov|Leskov]], [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], [[Robert Walser (writer)|Walser]], and [[translation theory]]. He also made major translations into German of the ''Tableaux Parisiens'' section of Baudelaire's ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' and parts of Proust's ''[[In Search of Lost Time|À la recherche du temps perdu]]''. In 1940, at the age of 48, Benjamin committed suicide at [[Portbou]] on the French–Spanish border while attempting to escape from invading [[Nazism|Nazi forces]]. Though popular acclaim eluded him during his life, the decades following his death won his work posthumous renown.

== Life ==
{{Frankfurt School}}

=== Early life and education ===
Benjamin and his younger siblings, Georg (1895–1942) and Dora (1901–1946), were born to a wealthy business family of assimilated [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in the Berlin of the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918). The patriarch of Walter Benjamin's family, Emil Benjamin, was a banker in Paris who relocated from France to Germany, where he worked as an antiques trader in Berlin; he later married Pauline Schönflies. He owned a number of investments in Berlin, including ice skating rinks. Benjamin's uncle [[William Stern (psychologist)|William Stern]] (born Wilhelm Louis Stern; 1871-1938) was a prominent German [[child psychology|child psychologist]] who developed the concept of the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ), and Benjamin's cousin [[Günther Anders]] (born Günther Siegmund Stern; 1902-1992) was a German philosopher and anti-nuclear activist who studied under [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]]. Through his mother, his great-uncle was the classical archaeologist [[Gustav Hirschfeld]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eiland, ''Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life'', Harvard University Press (2014), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, ten-year-old Walter was enrolled to the Kaiser Friedrich School in [[Charlottenburg]]; he completed his secondary school studies ten years later. Walter Benjamin was a boy of fragile health and so in 1905 the family sent him to Hermann-Lietz-Schule Haubinda, a [[boarding school]] in the [[Thuringia]]n countryside, for two years; in 1907, having returned to Berlin, he resumed his schooling at the Kaiser Friedrich School.&lt;ref name="Witte" /&gt;

In 1912, at the age of twenty, he enrolled at the [[University of Freiburg]], but, at summer semester's end, returned to Berlin, then matriculated into the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], to continue studying philosophy. Here Benjamin had his first exposure to the ideas of [[Zionism]], which had not been part of his liberal upbringing. This exposure gave him occasion to formulate his own ideas about the meaning of Judaism. Benjamin distanced himself from political and nationalist Zionism, instead developing in his own thinking what he called a kind of "cultural Zionism"—an attitude which recognized and promoted Judaism and Jewish values. In Benjamin's formulation his Jewishness meant a commitment to the furtherance of European culture. Benjamin expressed "My life experience led me to this insight: the Jews represent an elite in the ranks of the spiritually active ... For Judaism is to me in no sense an end in itself, but the most distinguished bearer and representative of the spiritual." This was a position that Benjamin largely held lifelong.&lt;ref&gt;Witte, Bernd. (1996) ''Walter Benjamin: An Intellectual Biography''. New York: Verso. pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Elected president of the ''Freie Studentenschaft'' (Free Students Association), Benjamin wrote essays arguing for educational and general cultural change.&lt;ref&gt;'' Experience'', 1913&lt;/ref&gt; When not re-elected as student association president, he returned to Freiburg University to study, with particular attention to the lectures of [[Heinrich Rickert]]; at that time he travelled to France and Italy.

In 1914, at the outbreak of the First World War (1914–1918), Benjamin began faithfully translating the works of the 19th-century French poet [[Charles Baudelaire]] (1821–1867). The next year, 1915, he moved to Munich, and continued his schooling at the [[University of Munich]], where he met [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Gershom Scholem]]; the latter became a friend. In that year, Benjamin wrote about the 18th-century [[Romanticism|Romantic]] German poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin]] (1770–1843).

In 1917 he transferred to the [[University of Bern]]; there, he met [[Ernst Bloch]], and Dora Sophie Pollak (née Kellner) (1890–1964) whom he later married. They had a son, Stefan Rafael (1918–1972). In 1919 Benjamin earned his [[Ph.D.]] ''[[cum laude]]'' with the dissertation ''Begriff der Kunstkritik in der Deutschen Romantik'' (''The Concept of Art Criticism in German Romanticism''). Later, unable to support himself and family, he returned to Berlin and resided with his parents. In 1921 he published the essay ''Kritik der Gewalt'' (The Critique of Violence). At this time Benjamin first became socially acquainted with [[Leo Strauss]], and Benjamin would remain an admirer of Strauss and of his work throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish philosophy and the crisis of modernity'' (SUNY 1997), ''Leo Strauss as a Modern Jewish thinker'', Kenneth Hart Green, Leo Strauss, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholem, Gershom. 1981. Walter Benjamin: The Story of a Friendship. Trans. Harry Zohn, page 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Correspondence of Walter Benjamin and Gershom Scholem, 1932–40'', New York 1989, page 155-58&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career ===
In 1923, when the ''[[Institute for Social Research|Institut für Sozialforschung]]'' (Institute for Social Research) was founded, later to become home to the [[Frankfurt School]], Benjamin published ''Charles Baudelaire, Tableaux Parisiens''. At that time he became acquainted with [[Theodor Adorno]] and befriended [[Georg Lukács]], whose ''The Theory of the Novel'' (1920) much influenced him. Meanwhile, the [[inflation in the Weimar Republic]] consequent to the First World War made it difficult for the father Emil Benjamin to continue supporting his son's family. At the end of 1923 his best friend Gershom Scholem immigrated to Palestine, a country under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]; despite repeated invitations, he failed to persuade Benjamin (and family) to leave the Continent for the Middle East.

In 1924 [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]], in the ''Neue Deutsche Beiträge'' magazine, published ''Goethes Wahlverwandtschaften'' (''[[Elective Affinities]]''), by Walter Benjamin, about Goethe's third novel, ''[[Elective Affinities|Die Wahlverwandtschaften]]'' (1809). Later that year Benjamin and Ernst Bloch resided on the Italian island of [[Capri]]; Benjamin wrote ''Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels'' (''The Origin of German Tragic Drama''), as a [[habilitation]] dissertation meant to qualify him as a tenured university professor in Germany. He also read, at Bloch's suggestion, ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923) by Georg Lukács. He also met the Latvian Bolshevik and actress [[Asja Lācis]], then residing in Moscow; she became his lover and was a lasting intellectual influence upon him.

A year later, in 1925, Benjamin withdrew ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' as his possible qualification for the habilitation teaching credential at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] at Frankfurt am Main, fearing its possible rejection;&lt;ref name="BL"&gt;Jane O. Newman, ''Benjamin's Library: Modernity, Nation, and the Baroque'', Cornell University Press, 2011, p. 28: "...university officials in Frankfurt recommended that Benjamin withdraw the work from consideration as his Habilitation."&lt;/ref&gt; he was not to be an academic instructor. Working with [[Franz Hessel]] (1880–1941) he translated the first volumes of ''À la Recherche du Temps Perdu'' (In Search of Lost Time) by [[Marcel Proust]]. The next year, 1926, he began writing for the German newspapers ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' (The Frankfurt Times) and ''Die Literarische Welt'' (The Literary World); that paid enough for him to reside in Paris for some months. In December 1926 (the year his father, Emil Benjamin, died) Walter Benjamin went to Moscow to meet Asja Lācis and found her ill in a sanatorium.&lt;ref&gt;''Moscow Diary''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, he began ''[[The Arcades Project|Das Passagen-Werk]]'' (The Arcades Project), his uncompleted ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', a study of 19th-century Parisian life. The same year, he saw Gershom Scholem in Berlin, for the last time, and considered emigrating from Continental Europe (Germany) to Palestine. In 1928, he and Dora separated (they divorced two years later, in 1930); in the same year he published ''Einbahnstraße'' (One-Way Street), and a revision of his habilitation dissertation ''Ursprung des Deutschen Trauerspiels'' (''The Origin of German Tragic Drama''). In 1929 Berlin, Asja Lācis, then assistant to [[Bertolt Brecht]], socially presented the intellectuals to each other. In that time, he also briefly embarked upon an academic career, as an instructor at the [[University of Heidelberg]].

=== Exile and death ===
[[File:BenjaminBnF.jpg|alt= Walter Benjamin's membership card for the Bibliothèque nationale de France (1940).|thumb|257x257px|Walter Benjamin's membership card for the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (1940).]]
In 1932, during the turmoil preceding [[Adolf Hitler]]'s assumption of the office of Chancellor of Germany, Walter Benjamin left Germany for the Spanish island of [[Ibiza]] for some months; he then moved to [[Nice]], where he considered killing himself. Perceiving the socio-political and cultural significance of the [[Reichstag fire]] (27 February 1933) as the ''de facto'' Nazi assumption of full power in Germany, then manifest with the subsequent [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|persecution of the Jews]], he moved to Paris, but, before doing so, he sought shelter in [[Svendborg]], at Bertolt Brecht's house, and at [[Sanremo]], where his ex-wife Dora lived.

As he ran out of money, Benjamin collaborated with [[Max Horkheimer]], and received funds from the Institute for Social Research, later going permanently into exile. In Paris, he met other German artists and intellectuals, refugees there from Germany; he befriended [[Hannah Arendt]], novelist [[Hermann Hesse]], and composer [[Kurt Weill]]. In 1936, a first version of ''[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]'' (''L'œuvre d'art à l'époque de sa reproduction méchanisée'') was published, in French, by Max Horkheimer in the ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' journal of the [[Institute for Social Research]]. It was a critique of the authenticity of mass-produced art; he wrote that a mechanically produced copy of an artwork can be taken somewhere where the original could never have gone, arguing that the presence of the original is "prerequisite to the concept of authenticity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Benjamin|first=Walter|date=1968|chapter=The Work Of Art In The Age Of Mechanical Reproduction|url=|title=Illuminations: Essays and Reflections|pages=217–253|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Benjamin's apartment in Paris (fot. Mateusz Palka).jpg|thumb|342x342px|Walter Benjamin's Paris apartment at 10 [[:fr:Rue Dombasle|rue Dombasle]] (1938–1940)]]In 1937 Benjamin worked on ''Das Paris des Second Empire bei Baudelaire'' (The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire), met [[Georges Bataille]] (to whom he later entrusted the ''Arcades Project'' manuscript), and joined the [[College of Sociology]]. In 1938 he paid a last visit to Bertolt Brecht, who was exiled to Denmark. Meanwhile, the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Régime]] stripped German Jews of their German citizenship; now a stateless man, Benjamin was arrested by the French government and incarcerated for three months in a prison camp near [[Nevers]], in central [[Burgundy (French region)|Burgundy]].

Returning to Paris in January 1940, he wrote ''Über den Begriff der Geschichte'' (''On the Concept of History'', later published as ''[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]''). While the [[Wehrmacht]] was pushing back the [[French Army]], on 13 June Benjamin and his sister fled Paris to the town of [[Lourdes]], just a day before the Germans entered the capital with orders to arrest him at his flat. In August, he obtained a travel visa to the US that Max Horkheimer had negotiated for him. In eluding the [[Gestapo]], Benjamin planned to travel to the US from neutral Portugal, which he expected to reach via [[Francoist Spain]], then ostensibly a neutral country.

[[File:Grab Walter Benjamin.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Walter Benjamin's grave in Portbou. The epitaph in German, repeated in Catalan, quotes from Section 7 of ''Theses on the Philosophy of History'': "There is no document of culture which is not at the same time a document of barbarism"]]The historical record indicates that he safely crossed the French–Spanish border and arrived at the coastal town of [[Portbou]], in [[Catalonia]]. The Franco government had cancelled all transit visas and ordered the Spanish police to return such persons to France, including the Jewish refugee group Benjamin had joined. They tried to cross the border on 25 September 1940, but were told by the Spanish police that they would be deported back to France the next day, which would have destroyed Benjamin's plans to travel to the United States. Expecting repatriation to Nazi hands, Walter Benjamin killed himself with an overdose of morphine tablets that night, while staying in the ''Hotel de Francia''; the official Portbou register records 26 September 1940 as the official date of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Arendt|editor=Walter Benjamin|first=Hannah|date=1968|chapter=Introduction|url=|title=Illuminations: Essays and Reflections|pages=23–24|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Witte"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Martin ''The Dialectical Imagination: A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research 1923–1950''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leslie|first=Esther|title=Walter Benjamin: Overpowering Conformism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FXUN34lH-jgC&amp;pg=PA215|accessdate=August 28, 2009|series=Modern European Thinkers|year=2000|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-1568-3|page=215|chapter=Benjamin's Finale}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lester|first=David|title=Suicide and the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1nkj-xSzYgC&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=August 28, 2009|year=2005|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-59454-427-9|page=74|chapter=Suicide to Escape Capture: Cases}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin's colleague [[Arthur Koestler]], also fleeing Europe, attempted suicide by taking some of the morphine tablets, but he survived.&lt;ref&gt;"Afraid of being caught by the Gestapo while fleeing France, [Koestler] borrowed suicide pills from Walter Benjamin. He took them several weeks later when it seemed he would be unable to get out of Lisbon, but didn't die." [[Anne Applebaum]], "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/26/did-the-death-of-communis_n_435939.html Did The Death Of Communism Take Koestler And Other Literary Figures With It?]" Huffington Post, 28 March 2010, URL retrieved 15 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Benjamin's brother Georg was killed at the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] in 1942. Despite his suicide, Benjamin was buried in the [[consecration|consecrated]] section of a Roman Catholic cemetery.

The others in his party were allowed passage the next day (maybe because Benjamin's suicide shocked Spanish officials), and safely reached [[Lisbon]] on 30 September. [[Hannah Arendt]], who crossed the French-Spanish border at Portbou a few months later, passed the manuscript of ''Theses'' to [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]]. Another completed manuscript, which Benjamin had carried in his suitcase, disappeared after his death and has not been recovered. Some critics speculate that it was his ''Arcades Project'' in a final form; this is very unlikely as the author's plans for the work had changed in the wake of Adorno's criticisms in 1938, and it seems clear that the work was flowing over its containing limits in his last years.

== Thought ==
[[File:Klee, Angelus novus.png|thumb|right|293x293px|[[Paul Klee]]'s 1920 painting ''[[Angelus Novus]]'', which Benjamin compared to "the angel of history"]]
Walter Benjamin corresponded much with [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]], and was occasionally funded by the [[Frankfurt School]] under the direction of Adorno and [[Horkheimer]], even from their New York City residence. The competing influences—Brecht's Marxism, Adorno's [[critical theory]], Gerschom Scholem's Jewish mysticism—were central to his work, although their philosophic differences remained unresolved. Moreover, the critic [[Paul de Man]] argued that the intellectual range of Benjamin's writings flows dynamically among those three intellectual traditions, deriving a critique via juxtaposition; the exemplary synthesis is ''Theses on the Philosophy of History''. At least one scholar, [[religious studies|historian of religion]] Jason Josephson-Storm, has argued that Benjamin's diverse interests may be understood in part by understanding the influence of [[Western Esotericism]] on Benjamin. Some of Benjamin's key ideas were adapted from occultists and [[New Age movement|New Age]] figures including [[Eric Gutkind]] and [[Ludwig Klages]], and his interest in esotericism is known to have extended far beyond the Jewish [[Kabbalah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 226–36 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Theses on the Philosophy of History'' ===
{{main|Theses on the Philosophy of History}}
''Theses on the Philosophy of History'' is often cited as Benjamin's last complete work, having been completed, according to Adorno, in the spring of 1940. The Institute for Social Research, which had relocated to New York, published ''Theses'' in Benjamin's memory in 1942. Margaret Cohen writes in the ''Cambridge Companion to Walter Benjamin'':

{{quote|In the "Concept of History" Benjamin also turned to Jewish mysticism for a model of praxis in dark times, inspired by the kabbalistic precept that the work of the holy man is an activity known as tikkun. According to the kabbalah, God's attributes were once held in vessels whose glass was contaminated by the presence of evil and these vessels had consequently shattered, disseminating their contents to the four corners of the earth. Tikkun was the process of collecting the scattered fragments in the hopes of once more piecing them together. Benjamin fused tikkun with the Surrealist notion that liberation would come through releasing repressed collective material, to produce his celebrated account of the revolutionary historiographer, who sought to grab hold of elided memories as they sparked to view at moments of present danger.}}

In the essay, Benjamin's famed ninth thesis struggles to reconcile the [[Idea of Progress]] in the present with the apparent chaos of the past:

{{quote|A Klee painting named ''[[Angelus Novus]]'' shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.}}

The final paragraph about the Jewish quest for the [[Messiah]] provides a harrowing final point to Benjamin's work, with its themes of culture, destruction, Jewish heritage and the fight between humanity and nihilism. He brings up the interdiction, in some varieties of Judaism, to try to determine the year when the Messiah would come into the world, and points out that this did not make Jews indifferent to the future "for every second of time was the strait gate through which the Messiah might enter."

=== ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' ===
{{main|The Origin of German Tragic Drama}}

''Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels'' (''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'', 1928), is a critical study of German baroque drama, as well as the political and cultural climate of Germany during the [[Counter-Reformation]] (1545–1648). Benjamin presented the work to the University of Frankfurt in 1925 as the (post-doctoral) dissertation meant to earn him the ''[[Habilitation]]'' (qualification) to become a university instructor in Germany.

Professor Schultz of University of Frankfurt found ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' inappropriate for his ''Germanistik'' department (Department of German Language and Literature), and passed it to the Department of Aesthetics (philosophy of art), the readers of which likewise dismissed Benjamin's work. The university officials recommended that Benjamin withdraw ''Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels'' as a ''Habilitation'' dissertation to avoid formal rejection and public embarrassment.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt; He heeded the advice, and three years later, in 1928, he published ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' as a book.&lt;ref&gt;''Introducing Walter Benjamin'', Howard Cargill, Alex Coles, Andrey Klimowski, 1998, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Arcades Project ===
{{Main|Arcades Project}}The ''[[Arcades Project|Passagenwerk]]'' (Arcades Project, 1927–40) was Walter Benjamin's final, incomplete book about Parisian city life in the 19th century, especially about the ''[[Passages couverts de Paris]]''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the covered passages that extended the culture of [[flâneur|''flânerie'']] (idling and people-watching) when inclement weather made ''flânerie'' infeasible in the boulevards and streets proper.

The Arcades Project, in its current form, brings together a massive collection of notes which Benjamin filed together over the course of thirteen years, from 1927 to 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Buck-Morss, Susan. ''The Dialectics of Seeing''. The MIT Press, 1991, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arcades Project was published for the first time in 1982, and is over a thousand pages long.

=== Writing style ===
[[Susan Sontag]] said that in Walter Benjamin's writing, sentences did not originate ordinarily, do not progress into one another, and delineate no obvious line of reasoning, as if each sentence "had to say everything, before the inward gaze of total concentration dissolved the subject before his eyes", a "freeze-frame baroque" style of writing and cogitation. "His major essays seem to end just in time, before they self-destruct".&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sontag ''Under the Sign of Saturn,'' p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty of Benjamin's writing style is essential to his philosophical project. Fascinated by notions of reference and constellation, his goal in later works was to use [[Intertextuality|intertexts]] to reveal aspects of the past that cannot, and should not, be understood within greater, monolithic constructs of historical understanding.

Walter Benjamin's writings identify him as a [[Modernism|modernist]] for whom the philosophic merges with the literary: logical philosophic reasoning cannot account for all experience, especially not for self-representation via art. He presented his [[Style (visual arts)|stylistic]] concerns in "The Task of the Translator", wherein he posits that a literary translation, by definition, produces deformations and misunderstandings of the original text. Moreover, in the deformed text, otherwise hidden aspects of the original, source-language text are elucidated, while previously obvious aspects become unreadable. Such translational modification of the source text is productive; when placed in a specific constellation of works and ideas, newly revealed affinities, between historical objects, appear and are productive of philosophical truth.

His work ''The Task of the Translator'' was later commented by the French translation scholar [[Antoine Berman]] (''[[L'âge de la traduction]]'').

== Legacy and reception ==
Since the publication of ''Schriften'' (Writings, 1955), 15 years after his death, Benjamin's work—especially the essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1936)—has become of seminal importance to academics in the humanities disciplines. In 1968, the first [[Internationale Walter Benjamin Gesellschaft]] was established by the [[Germany|German]] thinker, poet and artist [[Natias Neutert]], as a free association of philosophers, writers, artists, media theoreticians and editors. They did not take Benjamin's body of thought as a scholastic "closed architecture [...], but as one in which all doors, windows and roof hatches are widely open", as the founder Neutert put it—more poetically than politically—in his manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Mit Walter Benjamin. Gründungsmanifest der Internationalen Walter-Benjamin-Gesellschaft.'' Copyleft Verlag, Hamburg, 1968, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The members felt liberated to take Benjamin's ideas as a welcome touchstone for social change.&lt;ref&gt;Hereto Helmut Salzinger: ''Swinging Benjamin. Verlag Michael Kellner, Hamburg 1990. {{ISBN|3-927623-05-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the first Internationale Walter Benjamin Gesellschaft, a new one, established in 2000, researches and discusses the imperative that Benjamin formulated in his ''Theses on the Philosophy of History'': "In every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest the tradition away from a conformism that is about to overpower it."

The successor society was registered in Karlsruhe (Germany); Chairman of the Board of Directors was Bernd Witte, an internationally recognized Benjamin scholar and Professor of Modern German Literature in Düsseldorf (Germany). Its members come from 19 countries, both within and beyond Europe and represents an international forum for discourse. The Society supported research endeavors devoted to the creative and visionary potential of Benjamin's works and their view of 20th century modernism. Special emphasis had been placed upon strengthening academic ties to Latin America and Eastern and Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://walterbenjamin.info/|title=International Walter Benjamin Society|website=walterbenjamin.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The society conducts conferences and exhibitions, as well as interdisciplinary and intermedial events, at regular intervals and different European venues:
* Barcelona Conference – September 2000
* Walter-Benjamin-Evening at Berlin – November 2001
* Walter-Benjamin-Evening at Karlsruhe – January 2003
* Rome Conference – November 2003
* Zurich Conference – October 2004
* Paris Conference – June 2005
* Düsseldorf Conference – June 2005
* Düsseldorf Conference – November 2005
* Antwerpen Conference – May 2006
* Vienna Conference – March 2007&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://walterbenjamin.info/ WalterBenjamin.info]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Walter Benjamin's ''Arcades Project'' was reinterpreted in an exhibition curated by [[Jens Hoffmann|Jens Hoffman]], held at the [[Jewish museum|Jewish Museum]] in New York City. The exhibition, entitled "The Arcades: Contemporary Art and Walter Benjamin", features 36 contemporary artworks representing the 36 convolutes of Benjamin's Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thejewishmuseum.org/exhibitions/the-arcades-contemporary-art-and-walter-benjamin|title=The Arcades: Contemporary Art and Walter Benjamin (March 17 - August 6, 2017)|website=''The Jewish Museum''. thejewishmuseum.org|access-date=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
