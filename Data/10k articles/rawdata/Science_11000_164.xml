      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4978">The '''Alberta Hail Project''' was a [[research]] project sponsored by the [[Alberta Research Council]] and [[Environment Canada]] to study hailstorm physics and dynamics in order to design and test means for suppressing [[hail]]. It ran from 1956 until 1985. The main instrument in this research was an [[S-band]] [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] [[weather radar]] located at the [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] Industrial Airport in central [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. 

A vast amount of data were collected from several other platforms to conduct research into precipitation mechanisms, [[Severe weather|severe storm]] development, hail suppression, [[hydrology]] and [[microwave]] propagation. Numerous researchers have used the dataset and during the period 1990 to 1994, 23 publications appeared in journals and conferences, as well as 4 scientific reports were prepared. These papers have included [[radar meteorology]], [[cloud physics]], hydrology/hydro[[meteorology]], [[computer science]], instrumentation, [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic]] weather, dynamic and [[mesoscale meteorology]]. 

== Description ==

The project area covered 33,700&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and was centered on the Penhold radar site located near the Red Deer Airport ({{coord|52.2|N|113.9|W}}). The program had different ways of evaluating the atmospheric conditions for hail and its detection.

Each spring, approximately 20,000 farmers in the project area would receive cards to record any event of hail, including its size. On days with hail, between 10&amp;nbsp;% and 20&amp;nbsp;% of the farmers gave report, an average of one observer per 16–32&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Telephone surveys were also conducted, resulting in observation densities as high as one report per 3 square kilometers. As a result, it is believed that only a very small percentage of hail reaching the surface went undetected.&lt;ref name=Poolman&gt;{{Cite journal| format= pdf | url= http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0434%282002%29017%3C1048%3AMMHSIA%3E2.0.CO%3B2 | doi= 10.1175/1520-0434(2002)017&lt;1048:MMHSIA&gt;2.0.CO;2 | first1 = Julian C. | last1=Brimelow | first2= Gerhard W. | last2= Reuter | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 1048–1062 |date=October 2002 | journal = [[Weather and Forecasting]] | publisher = [[American Meteorological Society|AMS]] | title = Modeling Maximum Hail Size in Alberta Thunderstorms |bibcode = 2002WtFor..17.1048B }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the duration of the project, six categories were specified to size the observed hailstones conveniently: diameters less than 0.4 cm, 0.4–1.2 cm, 1.3–2.0 cm; 2.1–3.2 cm, 3.3–5.2 cm, and larger than 5.2 cm.&lt;ref name=Poolman/&gt;

[[Radiosondes]] were released from Penhold at 1715 local time (2315 UTC). Data were used to evaluate the atmospheric conditions on hail days within 3 h (i.e., between 1415 and 2015 LT) and within 100 km from the sounding site. A few of these proximity soundings had to be excluded because of missing data or because they were modified by precipitation or a thunderstorm [[Outflow (meteorology)|outflow boundary]]. In addition to upper-air sounding data, the surface temperature and dewpoint (representative of the storm's inflow) were obtained from a [[mesonet]]work.&lt;ref name=Poolman/&gt;

The radar would be used to detect not only the intensity of the precipitation by its [[reflectivity]], but the type of [[hydrometeor]]s with the [[Weather radar|circular polarization]]. These would be correlated with the surface observations to study the structure of the thunderstorms leading to hail formation. Furthermore, at certain times there would be aircraft flight in and around convective areas to gather further information on the atmospheric conditions and sample the clouds.

Observations were also made by [http://cmosarchives.ca/Metphotos/T10/ALHAS1_1969.jpg sampling vehicles]. The vehicles were outfitted with various meteorological instrumentation and hail catching apparatus. They were directed into suspected thunderstorm hail regions by a controller at the radar site. The controller communicated with the vehicles by radio.&lt;ref name="sampling"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barge |first=B. L. | last2=Isaac| first2= G.

'''Anna Dmitrievna Gelman''' (also '''Dmitriyevna/Dmitryevna''') (Russian: Гельман Анна Дмитриевна) (18 February 1902 — 29 March 1991) (née Nikitin) was a Russian [[chemist]] and [[engineer]]. She was the first to synthesise [[alkene]] [[Coordination complex|complexes]] of [[platinum]], discovered [[Valence (chemistry)|heptavalent]] states of [[plutonium]] and other [[actinide]]s and created and improved processes for [[radionuclide]] production.

==Life and career==
She was born in [[Biysk]], [[Altai Krai]], [[Siberia]]. Her mother was a seamstress and her father a woodman. Her father died when she was seven, so she helped her mother with her three younger siblings. Aged eight, she went to school and graduated with a merit certificate. She attended Biysk Women's High School and because of her study efforts was released from school fees. She graduated in 1921 but had not received appropriate education to enrol at [[Tomsk University]], 450 km to the north. She underwent two years of self-study while teaching in a Tomsk orphanage, before being accepted on a one-year course in [[Leningrad]], 3400 km from her home town. While there, she married August Ansovich Gelman, a border guard. Thereafter, she lived in different border posts of Siberia and central Asia while teaching.&lt;ref name="Rosatom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblioatom.ru/founders/Gelman_Anna_Dmitrievna/|title=Гельман Анна Дмитриевна (1902—1991)|website=www.biblioatom.ru|access-date=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, she was transferred to the [[Crimea]] for health reasons. In 1930, she enrolled at the Crimean Pedagogical Institute. She studied in the department of chemistry and worked in a bromine plant in the town of Saki. In the spring of 1932, her husband died. That autumn, she graduated and was recommended for postgraduate studies at the [[Herzen University|Leningrad Pedagogical Institute]]. She passed the entrance exams but also took the exams for graduate studies. The course leader, I.I. Chernyaev, told her she had the knowledge but that, aged 30, she was too old to study science. She made it clear she was offended, and Chernyaev took her under his supervision. From 1932-36, she was a graduate student and a senior research associate at the Institute of National Economy and [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]]. In 1934, she published her first work, under her maiden name, Nikitin, as an engineer: the VIAM (All-union Institute for Aviation Materials (Russian:Всесоюзный институт авиационных материалов)) production instruction. She was a part-time assistant professor at the Department of Inorganic Chemistry at the University from 1936-38.  Chernyaev invited her to become a doctoral student at the [[:ru:Институт общей и неорганической химии имени Н. С. Курнакова РАН|Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry]] in [[Moscow]] in 1938. She gained a Ph.D. in 1941 and worked as a senior researcher at the Institute until 1949.&lt;ref name="Rosatom"/&gt;

Gelman was the first to find ways of synthesising [[ethylene]] (and other [[alkene]]) complexes of [[platinum]]. Her graduate work in 1941 explained the action of ethylene on platinum (III) salts at low pressure. She found new compounds of platinum (II) and (III) using propylene and butene amongst other alkenes. The [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] was evacuated to [[Kazan]] in [[World War II]]; while there she received a [[telegram]] from [[Josef Stalin]] in 1943 thanking her for her concern about Soviet forces. A [[monograph]] of her doctoral dissertation was published in 1945 after the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory and she received the [[Order of the Badge of Honour]], 1st degree for her scientific work and patronage. She continued with work on platinum-alkene complexes, which were later used in [[Homogeneous catalysis|homogeneous catalysis]].&lt;ref name="Rosatom"/&gt;

In the winter of 1945, Chernyaev instructed Gelman to develop processes to isolate [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] compounds from aqueous solutions. This was followed up with the isolation of [[plutonium]] from uranium and nuclear fission by-products in 1947. In the absence of plutonium - which was only just being produced in small quantities in the [[Soviet Union]] - Gelman and her colleague L.N. Essen replaced plutonium (IV) with thorium, plutonium (III) with [[lanthanum]] and used rare-earth element fragments to imitate fission products. This production scheme, in which [[oxalate]]s and [[carbonate]]s of plutonium were removed from the solution, was verified at NII-9 (now the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Inorganic Materials (VNIINM)) for implementation at Plutonium Combine No.817, which was just being built; the product for delivery to the metallurgical department was purified [[Plutonium(IV) oxide|plutonium dioxide]]. Gelman was seconded to the plant until 1951; all radiochemical staff - many of whom were young graduates from technical schools and universities - faced considerable risks to their health while production and safety procedures were being developed. Plant workers suffered and died, e.g. from pneumosclerosis, after the inhalation of aerosols of [[alpha particle]]-emitting [[radionuclide]]s produced in processing after the irradiation of the uranium source material. Gelman, with her colleagues Chernyaev, and V.D. Nikolsky, wrote the first regulations for processing plutonium salts; they won state prizes in 1949 and 1951 for creating and improving plutonium refining technology.&lt;ref name="Rosatom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A.N. Frumkin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.phyche.ac.ru/?page_id=4011|title=Scientific school of Academician V.I.

Gelman returned to Moscow in 1952, securing 50 grammes of plutonium dioxide from Combine No.817 for researchers to use at the Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry. The compound was used in the doctoral theses of students who went on to become leading researchers at the plutonium plant. She became part-time deputy chief of the plant, working in the radiochemical research section. She married Boris Musrukov, director of the plant and major-general of the engineering service. He was soon transferred to the [[Ministry of Medium Machine Building]] and, in 1955, he was appointed director of [[Arzamas-16]], (also known as KB-11 [Design Bureau-11] based at the closed city of [[Sarov]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]] oblast. Gelman raised his two children and, after separating from him, his daughter Elena remained with Gelman.&lt;ref name="Rosatom"/&gt;

V.I. Spitzyn, director of the Institute of Physics and Chemical Sciences of the Academy of Sciences, suggested in 1954 (with the support of Chernyaev and [[Ministry of Medium Machine Building]] (the state organ controlling nuclear facilities) that Gelman transfer there because a new 'hot' laboratory was being built. She accepted and directed the laboratory researching [[transuranium elements]], inviting colleagues from Combine No.817 and the Institute of Microorganisms to join her. She remained at the laboratory for the rest of her career. In the primary research undertaken, various [[actinide]]s were studied with many different types of [[ligand]]s in simple and complex compounds, with research published internationally. Gelman, with students N.N. Krot and M.P. Mefod'eva discovered heptavalent states of plutonium and [[neptunium]] in 1967 (Gelman and Krot later received the State Prize of the USSR for their discovery of the heptavalency of plutonium, neptunium and [[americium]]). Gelman retained and developed connexions with her former workplaces and other radioisotope research centres, particularly the [[Mayak]] plutonium production plant and also the [[Siberian Chemical Combine]] in Tomsk and the [[Mining and Chemical Combine]] in [[Krasnoyarsk]]. Methods continued to be improved for the isolation of plutonium and neptunium salts.&lt;ref name="Rosatom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A.N. Frumkin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soviet Scientists"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/17/076/17076279.pdf|website=inis.iaea.org|title=Opportunities and Challenges in Research with Transplutonium Elements|last=Friedlander|first=Gerhart et. al.|location=Washington D.C.|publisher=National Academy Press|year=1983|access-date=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spitzyn|first=Victor Ivanovich|title=Soviet Chemistry Today: Its Present State and Outlook for the Future, a Series of Six Lectures|pages=13, 26|location=Washington D.C.|publisher=National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council|year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Gelman put forward the 38-year-old N.N. Krot as her replacement as the laboratory director, over the objections of some of the Academic Council of the Institute of Physics of the Academy of Sciences. She remained in a consulting role.&lt;ref name="Rosatom"/&gt;

She died on 29 March 1994 in Moscow. She was buried at Novokuntsevo cemetery.&lt;ref name="Rosatom"/&gt;

'''William Brian Binnie''' (born 1953) is a former United States Navy officer and one of the test pilots for [[SpaceShipOne]], the experimental [[spaceplane]] developed by [[Scaled Composites]] and flown from 2003–2004.

==History==
[[File:Wife of astronaut Brian Binnie greets him upon compleation of the final flight photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|Wife Bub Binnie upon completion of the final flight in October 2004]]
Binnie was born in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]], where his Scottish father William P. Binnie was a professor of physics at [[Purdue University]]. The family returned to Scotland when Binnie was five, and lived in [[Aberdeen]] (his father taught at [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen University]]) and later in [[Stirling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://icstirlingshire.icnetwork.co.uk/observer/news/tm_method=full%26objectid=17409899%26siteid=92391-name_page.html |title=Stirling has a space ace |work=Stirling Observer |date=July 19, 2006 |accessdate=November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Binnie was a teenager the family moved to [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~paw/archive_new/PAW04-05/09-0223/features4.html |title=Rocket man |work=Princeton Alumni Weekly |first=Kathy |last=Kiely |date=February 23, 2005 |accessdate=November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Binnie, an alumnus of [[Brown University|Brown]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] Universities, served for 21 years in the [[United States Navy]] as a [[United States Naval Aviator|naval aviator]] flying the [[A-7 Corsair II]], [[A-6 Intruder]], [[F/A-18 Hornet]], and [[AV-8B Harrier II]]. He graduated from the [[United States Naval Test Pilot School|U.S. Naval Test Pilot School]] in 1988. Binnie also copiloted the Atmospheric Test Vehicle of the [[Rotary Rocket]]. In 2006, he received an Honorary degree from University of Aberdeen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/scotland/north_east/5140682.stm |title=Degree for 'first Scot in space' |work=BBC News |date=July 3, 2006 |accessdate=November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SpaceShipOne and spaceflight===
On December 17, 2003, the 100th anniversary of the [[Wright brothers]]' first powered flight, Binnie piloted the first powered test flight of SpaceShipOne, [[SpaceShipOne flight 11P|flight 11P]], which reached a top speed of Mach 1.2 and a height of {{convert|20.7|km|mi|disp=flip}}. On October 4, 2004, he piloted SpaceShipOne's second [[Ansari X Prize]] flight, [[SpaceShipOne flight 17P|flight 17P]], winning the X Prize and becoming the 435th person to go into space. His flight, which peaked at {{convert|367442|ft|mi km|1}}, set a winged aircraft altitude record,&lt;ref name=alt&gt;"[http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=9881 FAI Record ID #9881 – Altitude above the earth's surface with or without maneuvres of the aerospacecraft, Class P-1 (Suborbital missions)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018225245/http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=9881 |date=October 18, 2015 }}" [http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=10434 Mass] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924043352/http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=10434 |date=September 24, 2015 }} [http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=9882 Time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924045447/http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=9882 |date=September 24, 2015 }} ''[[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI).''

Proposed by [[Roy John Britten]] and [[Eric H. Davidson]] in 1969, the model postulates four classes of [[DNA]] sequence: an integrator gene, a producer gene, a receptor site, and a sensor site. The sensor site regulates the integrator gene, responsible for synthesis of activator RNA. The integrator gene cannot synthesize activator RNA unless the sensor site is activated. Activation and deactivation of the sensor site is done by external stimuli, such as hormones. The activator RNA then binds with a nearby receptor site, which stimulates the synthesis of [[mRNA]] at the [[structural gene]].

This theory would explain how several different integrators could be synthesized at the same time. In addition, this theory would explain the pattern of [[repetitive DNA]] sequences followed by a unique [[DNA]] sequence that exists in [[gene]]s.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Genetics Classical to Modern| last=Gupta| first=P.K.| publisher=Rastogi Publications| year=2007| page=657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Civic Planetarium of Lecco''' ('''{{lang|it|Planetario civico di Lecco}}''' or '''{{lang|it|Planetario Città di Lecco}})''' also known as the '''City Planetarium''' is located within [[Palazzo Belgioioso, Lecco|Palazzo Belgioioso]] in [[Lecco]], [[Italy]]. Planetarium is part of [[Natural History Museum, Lecco|Natural History Museum]] of Lecco.&lt;ref name="DSIT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Planetario civico di Lecco|url=http://www.deepspace.it/|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the [[planetarium]] is to be a place for specialists and people interested in astronomy in the region. It organizes meetings and lessons in which experiences and expertise are shared.&lt;ref name="MLO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museilecco.org/planetario.htm|title=Il Planetario nel sistema museale lecchese|accessdate=2014-04-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702105725/http://www.museilecco.org/planetario.htm|archivedate=2014-07-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Amateur Astronomers Group "DEEP SPACE Lecco" helps manage the observatory. The instrument consists of a projector and an aluminum dome, which acts as a screen. It can be used to simulate the movement of celestial bodies on the sky.&lt;ref name="MLO"/&gt; The dome is eight meters in diameter and can seat sixty observers.&lt;ref name="eccolecco"&gt;{{cite web|title=Planetarium of Lecco - Italy|url=http://www.eccolecco.it/en/art-and-culture/lecco-museums/planetarium-of-lecco|website=EccoLecco|accessdate=2016-06-25|date=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the shows are accompanied by a lecturer.

The planetarium accelerates the movement of the moon and stars in order to allow observation of processes that normally take days or months.&lt;ref name="eccolecco" /&gt; The Planetarium building consists of various rooms: the ticket office, a library for members, a room dedicated to the exhibition of astronomical instruments and a media room used for conferences. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deepspace.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=151&amp;Itemid=19|title=Struttura del Planetario|language=it|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The astronomical dome in the Planetarium was inaugurated on September 19, 2011. The small dome on the roof of the building comes from Canada and inside there is a Celestron C11 telescope, a catadioptric remotely controlled Schmidt-Cassegrain, so they can observe the whole sky even in the conference room. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lecconotizie.com/attualita/planetario-di-lecco-inaugurata-la-nuova-cupola-e-la-spark-chamber-28053/|title=Inaugurazione cupola e spark chamber|language=it|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2016 the director of the planetarium is Erasmo Bardelli. The ticket costs 3 euros.

The '''effort heuristic''' is a mental [[rule of thumb]] in which the quality or worth of an object is determined from the perceived amount of effort that went into producing that object. In brief, the effort  [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristic]] follows a tendency to judge objects that took a longer time to produce to be of higher value.&lt;ref name="Source 1"&gt;Kruger, J., Wirtz, D., Boven, L., &amp; Altermatt, T. (2004). The effort heuristic. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 40, 91-98.&lt;/ref&gt; The more effort invested in an object, the better it is deemed to be. This is especially true in situations where value is difficult to assess or the evaluator lacks expertise in the appraisement of an item. People use whatever information is available to them and effort is thought to generally be a reliable indicator of quality.&lt;ref name="Source 1" /&gt;

An example of this would be the comparison of $100 earned, and $100 found. If someone finds $100 they are more inclined to go spend it on a whim, but if that $100 is part of a hard-earned paycheck, they are less likely to squander it away. Another way that effort heuristic can be considered is the amount of effort a person will put into an action depending on the goal.&lt;ref name="Source 2"&gt;Bijeveld, E., Custers, R., &amp; Aarts, H. (2012). Adaptive reward pursuit: How effort requirements affect unconscious reward responses and conscious reward decisions. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 141, 728-742.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Source 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Source 4"&gt;Zhang, Y., Xu, J., Jiang, Z., &amp; Huang, S. (2011). Been There, Done That: The Impact of Effort Investment on Goal Value and Consumer Motivation. Journal of Consumer Research, 38, 78-93.&lt;/ref&gt; If the goal is of little importance, the amount of effort a person is willing to put into it is going to be lower.&lt;ref name="Source 3"&gt;Festinger, L. (1957). A theory of cognitive dissonance. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Kruger study==
There is experimental evidence that supports the notion that people sometimes use the effort that has been put into doing something as an estimate for its quality. The seminal study that investigated this phenomenon was done by Kruger, Wirtz, Van Boven, and Altermatt (2004). They conducted three experiments in which participants made judgments of quality—a poem in Experiment 1, paintings in Experiment 2, and medieval arms and armor in Experiment 3. In each experiment, they manipulated the effort seemingly invested in the objects' creation. Despite the fact that the actual quality of the work remained the same, they anticipated that manipulations in supposed effort would influence perceived quality.&lt;ref name="Source 1" /&gt;

=== Experiment 1 ===
In the first experiment, participants evaluated a poem with respect to how much they enjoyed it, the overall quality of the poem, and the amount of money a poetry magazine would pay for the poem. They were told that the experiment concerned the way in which people evaluate poetry. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of two condition groups in this study: low effort and high effort.  Participants in the low effort condition were told that the writer spent 4 hours on the poem while participants in the high effort condition were told the poet spent 18 hours on the piece.  The researchers combined the liking and quality measures into one composite result and found participants provided more favorable evaluations of the poem when they thought it took the poet 18 hours to compose rather than when they thought it took him 4 hours. They also judged the more effortful poem to be worth more money.

=== Experiment 2 ===
In the second experiment, non-experts and self-identified experts individually evaluated the quality of two paintings by Deborah Kleven: ''12 Lines'' and ''Big Abstract.'' Half of the participants were told that the former took 4 hours to paint and the latter 26 hours, and the other half were told the opposite. After rating each painting separately, participants then compared the two paintings directly.

The results revealed that participants preferred ''12 Lines'' over ''Big Abstract'' when they thought ''12 Lines'' took longer to paint, but the opposite tended to be true when they thought that ''Big Abstract'' took longer to paint. The effort manipulation had a similar effect on participants estimates of how much the paintings were worth. Participants who thought ''12 Lines'' took longer to produce thought that it was worth more money than ''Big Abstract'', whereas the opposite tended to be true when participants thought that ''Big Abstract'' took longer to paint. The data also indicated that the effect of perceived effort on perceived quality was independent of whether participants had self-professed expertise in the domain. Self-identified art experts did not appear to rely on effort any less than novices, despite the fact that the self-identified experts were presumably more practiced at evaluating art. This points to the generality and intuitive appeal of effort as a heuristic for quality.

=== Experiment 3 ===
In the third and final experiment, researchers asked participants to rate the quality of several images of medieval arms and armor presented on a computer screen. When rating the final target piece of armor, half of the participants were told that it took the blacksmith 110 hours to complete, and half were told that it took 15 hours. In addition to manipulating the perceived effort invested by the artist, researchers also varied the ambiguity of the stimulus to examine its potential as a moderator in the use of the effort heuristic. This was done by altering the resolution of the image where half of the participants viewed a high-resolution image of the piece, and half viewed a low-resolution image.

Experiment 3 produced similar results as the first two; participants provided higher ratings of the piece when they thought it took the blacksmith longer to produce. The more effort invested in the object, the better it was assumed to be. The influence of effort on judgment was also bigger in the high-ambiguity condition than in the low-ambiguity condition. This was expected because the quality of the armor was more ambiguous in the low-resolution condition. Participants in this condition had less objective information upon which to make a judgment of quality, and thus were more likely to rely on the perceived effort invested by the blacksmith while evaluating.

==Explanations==
Human behavior, like most other animals, is often driven by rewards and directed by the energetic cost of an action. It takes effort to attain rewards, and people accordingly weigh the value of rewards against the amount of effort that is required to attain them.&lt;ref name="Source 2" /&gt; At an early age, children learn that good performance due to high effort is valued by adults and that teachers are most likely to reward those who work hard.&lt;ref name="Source 5"&gt;Juvonen, J., &amp; Murdock, T. (1995). Grade-Level Differences in the Social Value of Effort: Implications for Self-Presentation Tactics of Early Adolescents. Child Development, 66, 1694-1694.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Source 6"&gt;Harari, O., &amp; Covington, M. (1981). Reactions to Achievement Behavior From a Teacher and Student Perspective: A Developmental Analysis. American Educational Research Journal, 18, 15-28.&lt;/ref&gt; With experience, they internalize effort as a valuable commodity.

==Alternative theories ==
Research directly examining and testing the effort heuristic is scarce, however there are other research areas that incorporated this construct and, in some way, manipulated its effects. However, a key distinction between the study done by Kruger et al. and other research on the role of effort on judgment is that the former focused on other-generated effort rather than self-generated effort.

===Cognitive dissonance===

====Effort justification ====
Over half a century ago, social psychologist Leon Festinger developed the theory of [[cognitive dissonance]]. It asserts that inconsistencies among a person's beliefs, attitudes, or opinions produce psychological discomfort, leading people to rationalize their behavior or change their attitudes.&lt;ref name="Source 3" /&gt; One concept that stemmed from the dissonance theory is that of [[effort justification]] in which the subjective value of an outcome is directly related to the effort that went into obtaining it.&lt;ref name="Source 3" /&gt; When people suffer, work hard or make sacrifices, they will attempt to convince themselves that it is worthwhile. People tend to put the most value on goals or items which have required considerable effort to achieve.&lt;ref name="Source 3" /&gt; This is probably because cognitive dissonance would arise if great effort is made to achieve something that is subsequently evaluated negatively.

====Aronson and Mills (1959)====
Aronson and Mills conducted a study&lt;ref name="Source 7"&gt;Aronson, E. &amp; Mills, J. (1959). The effect of severity of initiation on liking for a group. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 59, 177-181.&lt;/ref&gt; where college students underwent a "severe" or a "mild" initiation to join a discussion group. Subjects in the severe initiation group were required to read a sexually explicit passage out loud in front of the experimenter, whereas those in the mild initiation group read a less embarrassing passage. When subjects were asked to evaluate the discussion group, those in the severe initiation condition rated it higher than those in the mild initiation group. Aronson and Mills interpreted their result in terms of cognitive dissonance. According to Aronson and Mills, to resolve the dissonance produced by reading the embarrassing passage, subjects in the severe initiation group gave more value to the discussion group than did subjects in the mild initiation group.&lt;ref name="Source 4" /&gt; The more difficult the task, the greater the value given to sources of reinforcement that followed task completion.

===Self-perception theory===
Daryl Bem (1965) proposed an alternative to the cognitive dissonance theory in explaining how attitudes are shaped. The [[self-perception theory]] suggests that people infer their own attitudes, opinions, and other internal states partly by observing their behavior and the circumstances in which that behavior occurs.&lt;ref name="Source 8"&gt;Bem, D. J. (1972). Self-perception theory. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (Vol. 6, pp. 1–62). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern of thought unfolds because people are engaged in normal efforts to better understand their own behaviors. Bem suggested that all individuals analyze their own behavior as much as an outside observer might and, as a result of these observations, people make judgments about why they are motivated to do what they do. He originally believed that most findings explained by cognitive dissonance were really due to self-perception. However, studies have shown that self-perception is primarily at work when subjects do not have well-defined attitudes regarding the issue at hand.&lt;ref name="Source 9"&gt;Olson, J., Roesesc, N., Meen, J., &amp; Robertson, D. (1995). The Preconditions and Consequences of Relative Deprivation: Two Field Studies1. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 25, 944–964.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Goal evaluations===
Research has shown that the amount of energy put towards the achievement of a goal may play a role in the development or change of an individual's attitude towards that goal.&lt;ref name="Source 10"&gt;Maich, K. (2014). Reducing cognitive dissonance through effort justification: Evidence from past studies and daily experience. Western Undergraduate Psychology Journal, 1, 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; While evaluating a goal, one is motivated to place more value on a goal that has required greater effort to achieve.&lt;ref name="Source 11"&gt;Zentall, T. R. (2010). Justification of effort by
humans and pigeons: Cognitive dissonance or contrast? Current Directions in Psychological Science, 19, 296-300.&lt;/ref&gt; Axsom and Cooper (1985) suggested that if an objective or the way in which a goal is obtained is not initially attractive, an individual may later look to their own past behavior to determine their attitude towards that goal. If much effort has been spent in the attainment of a goal, it should come to be seen as worthwhile and therefore more attractive.&lt;ref name="Source 13"&gt;Axsom, D., &amp; Cooper, J. (1985). Cognitive dissonance and psychotherapy: The role of effort justification in inducing weight loss. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 21, 149-160.&lt;/ref&gt; This resembles the need to justify one's efforts in accordance with the cognitive dissonance theory but there is evidence supporting that other factors may be at play.

One study proposed that the experienced goal value and consumers' subsequent motivation vary as a function of whether or not the pursuit of the goal is perceived to be one's autonomous choice.&lt;ref name="Source 4" /&gt; They found that when consumers perceive that the goal they pursue is adopted through an autonomous choice, the initial effort investment is experienced as reflecting the value of the goal; therefore, greater effort increased the value of the goal as well as consumers' subsequent motivation.&lt;ref name="Source 4" /&gt; Conversely, if consumers perceive that the goal has been imposed on them, they experience psychological reactance that is proportional to the amount of effort that they expend in pursuing the goal; thus, they devalue the goal as they invest more effort in its pursuit and show lower subsequent motivation.&lt;ref name="Source 4" /&gt;

===Consumer appraisement===
The study by Kruger et al. demonstrated that when evaluating an item, people have a tendency to judge objects that took a longer time to produce to be of higher value. With this knowledge, companies can manipulate the manner in which a product is viewed to make their products appear desirable to consumers. Because effort is usually required to get the best outcomes, people looking for the best outcomes presume effort must imply the best possible outcome. Briñol, Petty, and Tormala (2006) suggested that the impact of effort on evaluation depends on the meaning people are overtly directed to assign to effort.&lt;ref name="Source 14"&gt;Briñol, Pablo, Richard E. Petty, and Zakary L. Tormala (2006), “The Malleable Meaning of Subjective Ease,” Psychological Science, 17 (3), 200–206.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if people are told that unintelligent people like ease, outcomes associated with ease are judged less favorably.&lt;ref name="Source 15"&gt;Kim, S., &amp; Labroo, A. (2011). From Inherent Value to Incentive Value: When and Why Pointless Effort Enhances Consumer Preference. Journal of Consumer Research, 38, 712-742.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxian economics===

====Labor theory of value====
The principles of the effort heuristic display a striking resemblance to the [[labor theory of value]]. This theory is a major pillar of traditional Marxian economics. Its basic claim is simple: the value of a commodity can be objectively measured by the average number of labor hours required to produce that commodity.&lt;ref name="Source 16"&gt;Bowles, S., &amp; Gintis, H. (1977). The marxian theory of value and heterogenous labour: A critique and reformulation. Cambridge Journal of Economics, 1, 173-192.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx described labor power as a worker's capacity to produce goods and services. He explained that the long-run wage workers receive will depend on the number of labor hours it takes to produce a person who is fit for work.&lt;ref name="Source 16" /&gt;

'''Explorer 38''' (also called as '''Radio Astronomy Explorer A''', '''RAE-A''' and '''RAE-1''') was the first [[satellite]] to study [[radioastronomy]]. Explorer 38 was launched as part of the [[Explorers program]], being the first of the 2 satellites '''RAE'''. Explorer 38 was launched on 4 July 1968 from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], [[California]], [[United States]], with an [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta J rocket]].

==Spacecraft==
Explorer 38 measured the intensity of celestial radio sources, particularly the [[Sun]], as a function of [[time]], [[Direction vector|direction]] and [[frequency]] (0.2 [[MHz]] to 20 MHz). The spacecraft was [[gravity]] [[gradient]] oriented. The spacecraft weight was {{convert|602|kg}}, and average power consumption was 25 W. It carried 2 {{convert|750|ft}} long V-[[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s, one facing toward the [[Earth]] and one facing away from the earth. A {{convert|120|ft}} long dipole antenna was oriented tangentially with respect to the [[earth's surface]].

The spacecraft was also equipped with one 136 MHz [[telemetry]] turnstile. The onboard experiments consisted of four step-frequency Ryle-Vonberg radiometers operating from 0.45 MHz to 9.18 MHz, two multichannel total power [[radiometer]]s operating from 0.2 MHz to 5.4 MHz, one step frequency V-antenna impedance probe operating from 0.24 MHz to 7.86 MHz, and one dipole [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] capacitance probe operating from 0.25 MHz to 2.2 MHz. Explorer 38 was designed for a 1 year minimum operating lifetime.

The spaecraft tape recorder performance began to deteriorate after 2 months in orbit. In spite of several cases of instrument malfunction, good data were obtained on all three antenna systems. The small satellite observed for months the "radio sky" in frequencies between 0.2 MHz and 9.2 MHz, but it was subjected to the continuous radio [[Interference (communication)|interference]] coming from our planet, both natural ([[aurorae]], [[thunderstorm]]s) and artificial.

==Instruments==
Explorer 38 has 4 antennas deployed in orbit:&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700019438.pdf|title=The spectrum of the extra-galactic background radiation at low radio frequencies|work=NASA|publisher=J.K. Alexander, L.W. Brown and T.A. Clark|accessdate=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2 V-shaped antennas with each of the 4 branches being {{convert|751|ft|m}} long and used by scientific experiments;
* a {{convert|37|m|ft}} [[electric dipole]] [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] used by scientific experiments;
* a cross-dipole turnstile antenna for the transmission of [[telemetry]] on a frequency of 137 [[MHz]].

The scientific experiments are:

* 4 [[Ryle-Vonberg]] [[radiometer]]s analyzing [[Frequency|frequencies]] between 0.45 MHz and 9.18 MHz;
* 2 multi-channel radiometers analyzing frequencies between 0.2 and 5.4 MHz;
* An impedance probe associated with 5 antennas analyzing frequencies between 0.24 MHz and 7.86 MHz;
* A [[capacitive]] probe associated with the dipole antenna analyzing frequencies between 0.25 MHz and 2.2 MHz.&lt;ref name="nasa"/&gt;

==Results==
The following results are reported in 1971:

* Absolute spectrum and average cosmic noise up to the frequency 0.5 MHz.
* Collection of [[radio]] data transmitted during type III [[Solar flare|solar radio burst]]s in the 0.2 MHz-5 MHz frequency band. These elements made it possible to obtain a first estimate of the [[solar corona]] [[electron]] density [[gradient]], the [[solar wind]] speed and density inhomogeneities in the solar corona regions between 10 and 30 [[solar radii]]s. A second radio broadcast of [[hecto|hectometric]] frequency was observed.
* An upper limit to the [[radio flux]] emitted by [[Jupiter]]'s [[High frequency|HF]] radio broadcasts was determined by the observations made during the [[Moon]]'s occultations of the giant planet.
* Radio emissions from the [[Earth]] of natural and [[human]] origin are both widespread and often very intense (40 [[Bel (unit)|dB]] higher than the [[Cosmic microwave background|cosmic background]]) on the frequencies observed (0.2 MHz to 9.2 MHz).&lt;ref name="nasa"/&gt;

'''Female hysteria''' was once a common [[medical diagnosis]] for women. It is no longer recognized by medical authorities as a medical disorder, but still has lasting social implications. Its diagnosis and treatment were routine for hundreds of years in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name=Maines&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-8018-6646-4| title=The Technology of Orgasm: "Hysteria", the Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction| first1=Rachel P.| last1=Maines| publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press| location=Baltimore| year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western medicine hysteria was considered both common and chronic among women. The [[American Psychiatric Association]] dropped the term ''hysteria'' in 1952. Even though it was categorized as a disease, hysteria's symptoms were synonymous with normal functioning female sexuality.&lt;ref name="Maines" /&gt; Women considered to have it exhibited a wide array of [[symptom]]s, including [[anxiety]], shortness of breath, [[fainting]], nervousness, [[sexual desire]], [[insomnia]], fluid retention, heaviness in the abdomen, [[irritability]], loss of appetite for food or sex, (paradoxically) sexually forward behaviour, and a "tendency to cause trouble".&lt;ref name="maines"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The technology of Orgasm: ‘Hysteria’, the Vibrator, and Women’s Sexual Satisfaction|last=Maines|first=Rachel|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=Baltimore|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In extreme cases, the woman may have been forced to enter an [[History of psychiatric institutions#Institutionalization|insane asylum]] or to have undergone surgical [[hysterectomy]].&lt;ref name=Mankiller&gt;{{cite book |author=Mankiller, Wilma P. |title=The Reader's Companion to U.S. Women's History |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co. |location=Boston, MA |year=1998 |pages=26 |isbn=0-6180-0182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of hysteria can be traced to ancient times. Dating back to 1900 BC in [[Ancient Egypt]], the first descriptions of hysteria within the female body were found recorded on the [[Kahun Papyri]].&lt;ref name="Tasca_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tasca C, Rapetti M, Carta MG, Fadda B | title = Women and hysteria in the history of mental health | journal = Clinical Practice and Epidemiology in Mental Health | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 110–9 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23115576 | pmc = 3480686 | doi = 10.2174/1745017901208010110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this culture, the womb was thought capable of affecting much of the rest of the body, but "there is no warrant for the fanciful view that the ancient Egyptians believed that a variety of bodily complaints were due to an animate, wandering womb".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merskey|first=Harold|last2=Potter|first2=Paul|year=1989|title=The womb lay still in ancient Egypt|url=|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=154|issue=6|pages=751–53|doi=10.1192/bjp.154.6.751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prolapse was also known.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Plato]]'s dialogue [[Timaeus (dialogue)|''Timaeus'']] compares a woman's [[uterus]] to a living creature that wanders throughout a woman's body, "blocking passages, obstructing breathing, and causing disease".&lt;ref name="HippocratesBeyondFreud"&gt;{{cite book |last=King | first=Helen| editor1-last=Gilman| editor2-last=King| editor3-last=Porter |editor-first4=G.S. | editor4-last=Rousseau |editor-first5=Elaine | editor-last5=Showalter | title=Hysteria beyond Freud |publisher=University of California Press |year=1993 |pages=3–90 |chapter=Once upon a text: Hysteria from Hippocrates |isbn=0-520-08064-5 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=LdxmV5J0pPkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Freud#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |editor-first=Sander |editor3-first=Helen |editor8-first=Roy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]] described the uterus as "an animal within an animal" (less emotively, "a living thing inside a living thing"), which causes symptoms by wandering around a woman's body putting pressure on other organs.&lt;ref name="gilman1993"/&gt; The standard cure for this "hysterical suffocation" was scent therapy, in which good smells were placed under a woman's genitals and bad odors at the nose, while sneezing could be also induced to drive the uterus back to its correct place.&lt;ref name="gilman1993" /&gt; The concept of a pathological "wandering womb" was later viewed as the source of the term ''hysteria'',&lt;ref name="HippocratesBeyondFreud"/&gt; which stems from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] cognate of uterus, ὑστέρα (''hystera'').

While in the Hippocratic texts a wide range of women were susceptible - including in particular the childless - [[Galen]] in the 2nd century omitted the childless and saw the most vulnerable group as "widows, and particularly those who previously menstruated regularly, had been pregnant and were eager to have intercourse, but were now deprived of all this" (''On the Affected Parts'', 6.5).&lt;ref name="gilman1993" /&gt; He also denied that the womb could "move from one place to another like a wandering animal".&lt;ref name="gilman1993" /&gt; His treatments included scent therapy and sexual intercourse, but also rubbing in ointments to the external genitalia; this was to be performed by midwives, not physicians.&lt;ref name="gilman1993" /&gt; While most Hippocratic writers saw the retention of menstrual blood in the womb as a key problem, for Galen even more serious was the retention of "female seed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medicine and the Making of Roman Women|last=Flemming|first=Rebecca|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=0199240027|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cause was{{when|date=November 2018}} thought to be the retention of a supposed female semen, thought to have mingled with male [[semen]] during intercourse. The female semen was believed to have been stored in the womb. Hysteria was referred to as "the widow's disease", because the female semen was believed to turn venomous if not released through regular climax or intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Roach| first=Mary| title=Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex| year=2009| publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co| location=New York| isbn=9780393334791| page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the patient was married, this could be completed by intercourse with their spouse. Other than participating in sexual intercourse, it was thought that women could position the uterus back into place with fumigation of both the face and genitals. Fumigating the body with special fragrances would supposedly place the uterus into its natural spot in the female body.&lt;ref name="Tasca_2012"/&gt;

== Middle Ages Renaissance, and Early Modern period ==

Through the Middle Ages another cause of dramatic symptoms could be found: demonic possession. It was thought that demoniacal forces were attracted to those who were prone to [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]], particularly single women and the elderly. When a patient could not be diagnosed, or cured of a disease, it was thought that the symptoms of what would now be diagnosed as mental illness, were actually those of someone possessed by the devil.&lt;ref name="carta"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Women and Hysteria In Mental Health|last2=Fadda|first2=Bianca|date=October 19, 2012|journal= Clin Pract Epidemiol Ment Health|last3=Rappeti|first3=Mariangela|last4=Tasca|first4=Cecilia|last1=Carta|first1=Mauro Giovanni|pmc=3480686|pmid=23115576|doi=10.2174/1745017901208010110|volume=8|pages=110–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 17th century, the correlation of demonic possession and hysteria were gradually discarded and instead was described as behavioral deviance, a medical issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spanos, Gottlieb|first=Nicholas, Jack|date=1979|title=Demonic possession, mesmerism, and hysteria: A social psychological perspective on their historical interrelations.|url=https://dx.doi.org.glacier.sou.edu/10.1037/0021-843X.88.5.527|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=|pages=527-546|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th and 17th centuries, hysteria was still believed to be due to retention of humours or fluids in the uterus, sexual deprivation, or by the tendency of the uterus to wander around the female body causing irritability and suffocation. Self-treatment such as [[masturbation]], was not recommended and also considered taboo. Marriage, and regular sexual encounters with her husband, was still the most highly recommended long-term course of treatment for a woman suffering from hysteria.&lt;ref name="carta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maines" /&gt; It was thought to purge the uterus of any built up fluid, and semen was thought to have healing properties, ‘In this model ejaculation outside the vagina was conducive to uterine disease, since the female genitalia did not receive the health benefits of male emission. Some physicians regarded all contraceptive practices as injurious to women for this reason’. [[Giovanni Matteo Ferrari da Gradi]] cited marriage and childbearing as a cure for the disease. If pleasure was obtained from them then hysteria could be cured.&lt;ref name="maines"/&gt; If a woman was unmarried, or widowed, manual stimulation by a midwife involving certain oils and scents was recommended to purge the uterus of any fluid retention. Lack of marriage was also thought to be the cause of most melancholy in single women, such as nuns or widows. Studies of the causes and effects of hysteria were continued in the 16th and 17th century by medical professionals such as [[Ambroise Pare]], [[Thomas Sydenham]], and [[Abraham Zacuto]] who published their findings furthering medical knowledge of the disease, and informing treatment.&lt;ref name="maines"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carta"/&gt; Physician Abraham Zacuto writes in his ''Praxis Medica Admiranda'' from 1637,

{{Quote|text='Because of retention of the sexual fluid, the heart and surrounding areas are enveloped in a morbid and moist exudation: this is especially true of the more lascivious females, inclined to venery, passionate women who are most eager to experience physical pleasure; if she is of this type she cannot ever be relieved by any aid except that of her parents who are advised to find her a husband. Having done so the man’s strong and vigorous intercourse alleviated the frenzy.’|author=Maines, 29|source=&lt;ref name="maines"/&gt; }}

There was continued debate about whether it was morally acceptable for a physician to remove excess female seed through genital manipulation of the female patient; Pieter van Foreest (Forestus) and Giovanni Matteo da Grado (Gradus) insisted on using midwives as intermediaries, and regarded the treatment as the last resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medical Ethics in the Renaissance|last=Schleiner|first=Winfried|publisher=Georgetown University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|page=115|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 18th century ==
In the 18th century, hysteria slowly became associated with mechanisms in the brain rather than the uterus. French physician [[Philippe Pinel]] freed hysteria patients detained in Paris’ Salpêtrière [[sanatorium]] on the basis that kindness and sensitivity are needed to formulate good care.

==19th century==
[[Jean-Martin Charcot]] argued that hysteria derives from a neurological disorder and showed hysteria is more common among men than women. &lt;ref name="Tasca_2012" /&gt; Charcot's theories of hysteria being a physical affliction of the mind and not of the body led to a more scientific and analytical approach to the disease in the 19th century. He dispelled the beliefs that hysteria had anything to do with the supernatural and attempted to define it medically.&lt;ref name="devereux"/&gt; Charcot's use of photography,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goetz|first=C.G.|date=1991|title=Visual art in the neurologic career of Jean-Martin Charcot|url=|journal=Archives of Neurology|volume=48|pages=421–25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the resulting concretization of women's expressions of health and distress, continue to influence women's experiences of seeking healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader|last=Jones|first=A.|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=248–58, 300–08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though older ideas persisted during this era, over time female hysteria began to be thought of less as a physical ailment and more of a psychological one.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/fantastically-wrong-wandering-womb/|title=Fantastically Wrong: The Theory of the Wandering Wombs That Drove Women to Madness|last=Simon|first=Matt|date=May 7, 2014|website=Wired|publisher=|accessdate=November 28, 2014|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Beard, a physician who cataloged an incomplete list including 75 pages of possible symptoms of hysteria,&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Briggs L | title = The race of hysteria: "overcivilization" and the "savage" woman in late nineteenth-century obstetrics and gynecology | journal = American Quarterly | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 246–73 | year = 2000 | pmid = 16858900 | doi = 10.1353/aq.2000.0013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that almost any ailment could fit the diagnosis. Physicians thought that the stress associated with the typical female life at the time caused civilized women to be both more susceptible to nervous disorders and to develop faulty reproductive tracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morantz RM, Zschoche S | title = Professionalism, feminism, and gender roles: a comparative study of nineteenth-century medical therapeutics | journal = Journal of American History | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 568–88 | date = December 1980 | pmid = 11614687 | doi = 10.2307/1889868 | jstor = 1889868 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One American physician expressed pleasure in the fact that the country was "catching up" to Europe in the prevalence of hysteria.&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt;

According to Pierre Roussel and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], femininity is a natural and essential desire for women, ‘Femininity is for both authors an essential nature, with defined functions, and the disease is explained by the non-fulfillment of natural desire.’&lt;ref name="carta"/&gt; It is during this era of industrial revolution and the major development of cities and modern life, that this natural tendency is thought to be disrupted causing lethargy or melancholy leading to hysteria.&lt;ref name="carta"/&gt; This melancholy or lethargy is retrospectively thought to have been caused and aggravated by the restrictive views on female sexuality at the time, which held masturbation as something unhealthy and unchaste. This led to a surge in female patients for medical practitioners who were looking for the massage cure to their hysteria. The rate of hysteria was so high in the socially restrictive industrial era that women were prone to carrying smelling salts about their person in case they swooned, reminiscent of Hippocrates’ theory of smells coercing the uterus back into place. For doctors manual massage treatment was becoming tiring, laborious and time-consuming and they were looking for a way to increase productivity.&lt;ref name="maines"/&gt;

[[Rachel Maines]] hypothesized that doctors from the [[classical era]] up until the early 20th century commonly treated hysteria by [[masturbating]] female patients to [[orgasm]] (termed "hysterical paroxysm"), and that the inconvenience of this may have driven the early development of and the market for the [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]].&lt;ref name=Maines/&gt; Although Maines's theory that hysteria was treated by masturbating female patients to orgasm is widely repeated in the literature on female anatomy and sexuality,&lt;ref name="Big Think"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-rachel-maines |title=Big Think Interview with Rachel Maines |last=Maines |first=Rachel |website=bigthink.com |accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; some historians dispute Maines's claims about the prevalence of this treatment for hysteria and about its relevance to the invention of the vibrator, describing them as a distortion of the evidence or that it was only relevant to an extremely narrow group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=King |first=Helen |date=2011 |title=Galen and the Widow: Towards a history of therapeutic masturbation in ancient gynaecology |url=http://eugesta.recherche.univ-lille3.fr/revue/pdf/2011/King.pdf |journal=EuGeStA: Journal on Gender Studies in Antiquity |volume=1 |pages=205–235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lesleyahall.net/factoids.htm#hysteria |title=Doctors masturbating women as a cure for hysteria/'Victorian vibrators' |last=Hall |first=Lesley |website=lesleyahall.net |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No, no, no!

==Freud and decline of diagnosis==
[[File:Hysteria chart.png|thumb|The number of French psychiatric theses on hysteria&lt;ref name=Micale&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Micale MS | title = On the "disappearance" of hysteria. A study in the clinical deconstruction of a diagnosis | journal = Isis; An International Review Devoted to the History of Science and Its Cultural Influences | volume = 84 | issue = 3 | pages = 496–526 | date = September 1993 | pmid = 8282518 | doi = 10.1086/356549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the early 20th century, the number of women diagnosed with female hysteria sharply declined. This decline has been attributed to many factors. Some medical authors claim that the decline was due to gaining a greater understanding of the psychology behind [[conversion disorder]]s such as hysteria.&lt;ref name=Micale/&gt;

With so many possible symptoms, historically hysteria was considered a [[catchall diagnosis]] where any unidentifiable ailment could be assigned.&lt;ref name="Tasca_2012" /&gt; As diagnostic techniques improved, the number of ambiguous cases that might have been attributed to hysteria declined. For instance, before the introduction of [[electroencephalography]], [[epilepsy]] was frequently confused with hysteria.&lt;ref name=Micale2000&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Micale MS | title = The decline of hysteria | journal = The Harvard Mental Health Letter | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–6 | date = July 2000 | pmid = 10877868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Sigmund Freud]] claimed that hysteria was not anything physical at all but an emotional, internal affliction that could affect both males and females, which was caused by previous trauma that led to the afflicted being unable to enjoy sex in the normal way.&lt;ref name="maines" /&gt;&lt;ref name="devereux"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/ESC/article/download/24855/18313|title=Hysteria, Feminism, and Gender Revisited: The Case of the Second Wave|last=Devereux|first=Cecily|date=March 2014|website=eJournal|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=October 20, 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would later lead to Freud's development of the [[Oedipus Complex]], which connotes femininity as a failure, or lack of masculinity.&lt;ref name="devereux" /&gt; Though these earlier studies had shown that men were also prone to suffer from hysteria, including Freud himself,&lt;ref name="gilman1993" /&gt; over time, the condition was related mainly to issues of femininity as the continued study of hysteria took place only in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/05/history-hysteria-sexism-diagnosis/|title=The History of Hysteria: Sexism in Diagnosis|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cases that had previously been labeled hysteria were reclassified by Freud as [[anxiety]] [[neurosis|neuroses]].&lt;ref name=Micale2000/&gt;  [[Sigmund Freud]] was fascinated by cases of hysteria. He thought that hysteria may have been related to the unconscious mind and separate from the conscious mind or the ego.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Psychology: Gateways to Mind and Behavior|last=Coon, Mitterer|first=Dennis, John|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=512-513}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was convinced that deep conflicts in the mind, some concerning instinctual drives for sex and aggression, were driving the behavior of those with hysteria. Freud developed [[psychoanalysis]] in order to help patients that had been diagnosed with hysteria reduce internal conflicts causing physical and emotional suffering.  While hysteria was reframed with reference to new laws and was new in principle, its recommended treatment in psychoanalysis would remain what Bernheimer observes it had been for centuries: marrying and having babies and in this way regaining the "lost" phallus.&lt;ref name="devereux"/&gt;

New theories relating to hysteria came from pure speculation; doctors and physicians could not connect symptoms to the disorder, causing it to decline rapidly as a diagnosis.&lt;ref name="pmid8282518"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Micale MS | title = On the "disappearance" of hysteria. A study in the clinical deconstruction of a diagnosis | journal = Isis; an International Review Devoted to the History of Science and Its Cultural Influences | volume = 84 | issue = 3 | pages = 496–526 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8282518 | doi = 10.1086/356549 | jstor = 235644 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, female hysteria is no longer a recognized illness, but different manifestations of hysteria are recognized in other conditions such as [[schizophrenia]], [[borderline personality disorder]], [[conversion disorder]], and [[anxiety attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Costa| first=Dayse Santos| last2=Lang| first2=Charles Elias| year=2016| title=Hysteria Today, Why?| url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0103-65642016000100115&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=en| journal=Psicologia USP| volume=27| issue=1| pages=115–124| via=SciELO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with women's rights and feminism==
Hysteria was often used as a political tool in the media to impede women's rights movements and invalidate their arguments and desire for equal rights and a larger role in society.

The most vehement negative statements associating feminism with hysteria came during the militant suffrage campaign. {{Quote|text=“One does not need to be against womens suffrage,” the London Times editorialized in 1908, "to see that some of the more violent partisans of that cause are suffering from hysteria. We use the word not with any scientific precision, but because it is the name most commonly given to a kind of enthusiasm that has degenerated into habitual nervous excitement.”’ |author=Gilman, 320 |source=&lt;ref name="gilman1993"/&gt; }}
In the 1980s, feminists began to reclaim hysteria, using it as a symbol of the systematic oppression of women and reclaiming the term for themselves.&lt;ref name="gilman1993"/&gt; The idea stemmed from the belief that Hysteria was a kind of pre-feminist rebellion against the oppressive defined social roles placed upon women. Feminist writers such as [[Catherine Clément]] and [[Hélène Cixous]] write in ''[[The Newly Born Woman]]'' from a place of opposition to the theories proposed in psychoanalytical works, pushing against the notion that socially constructed femininities and hysteria are natural to being female.&lt;ref name="gilman1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="devereux"/&gt;  Feminist social historians of both genders argue that hysteria is caused by women’s oppressive social roles rather than by their bodies or psyches, and they have sought its sources in cultural myths of femininity and in male domination.’&lt;ref name="gilman1993"/&gt;

The 19th century definition of femininity has far reaching implications in modern thought as it cements the idea of woman as child bearer, and denotes women who do not conform to the established norms of sexuality and psychoanalysis, as wrong or defective.&lt;ref name="devereux"/&gt;

In mass communication, the '''Hierarchy of Influences''', formally known as the '''Hierarchical Influences Model''', is an organized theoretical framework introduced by [[Pamela Shoemaker]] &amp; Stephen D. Reese. It comprises five levels of influence on media content from the macro to micro levels: social systems, social institutions, media organizations, routine practices, and individuals. This framework was introduced in their book ''Mediating the Message: Theories of Influences on Mass Media Content''.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (1996). Mediating the Message: Theories of Influences on Mass Media Content, 2nd edn, White Plains, NY: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Five levels of Hierarchy of Influences ==

The framework was proposed for use in media effects research of media content. Based on media sociology and psychological studies perspective, the framework "takes into account the multiple forces that simultaneously impinge on media and suggests how influence at one level may interact with that at another."&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas most media effects study treat media content as independent variable to understand how audience use media content and how they are influenced by media content, "Hierarchy of Influences" framework treats media content as dependent variable and five levels of influences as potential independent variables.

Overall, the framework provides a way to understand the "media and their links with culture, other organizations, and institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social systems ===

The macro social systems level is the outer-most ring of the model that represent the influences from social systems as a whole. This level focus on how ideological forces shape and influence media content. For this reason, it is often employed in cross-national comparative media studies.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge..&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social institutions ===

Social institutional level describes influences coming from larger trans-organizational media field. How media organizations combine into larger institutions that become part of larger structured relationships that compete or depend on each other as powerful social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media organizations ===

Media organization level is distinguished from routines as this level describes larger organizational and occupational context such as organizational policy, occupational roles, and how the media enterprise  itself is structured.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Routine practices ===

The routines level has three sources of routines, which constrain and enable communicators in their work process: audiences, organizations, and suppliers of content. Journalists have developed routines from endless pattern of norms in response to common situations. This level is where Mr. Gates or [[gatekeeping (communication)]] theory is also applied in journalists' appearance

=== Individuals ===

The micro individual level is located at the center of the model. On this level, individual communicator's characteristics, on both personal and professional, influence media content. Individual's innate characteristics such as gender, race, religious and political background influence media content indirectly through shaping personal attitude and values (e.g. ethical values) as well as professional roles and education.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Hierarchy of influences model has been employed as theoretical framework to explain different levels of influences on media content. Researchers have studied professionalism, journalistic roles,&lt;ref&gt;Reese, S. (2001). Understanding the global journalist: A hierarchy-of-influences approach. Journalism Studies, 2(2), 173-187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2007). Deconstructing journalism culture: Toward a universal theory. Communication Theory, 17, 367-385.&lt;/ref&gt; cross-national comparative journalistic roles,&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2006). Worlds of journalisms. Retrieved March 6, 2016, from http://www.worldsofjournalism.org&lt;/ref&gt; comparative media studies, and understanding news production to name a few of closely studies areas.

Thomas Hanitzsch took a similar approach to hierarchy of influences model in examining different levels of influences on journalists' reporting process in his ''Worlds of Journalism'' study.&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2006). Worlds of journalisms. Retrieved March 6, 2016, from http://www.worldsofjournalism.org&lt;/ref&gt; This study conducted interviews in 21 countries focusing on differences in [[journalism culture]], influences and trust in public institutions.

The book is divided into five parts, where the first part contains the descriptions of clock designs, while the rest of the book is devoted to the analysis of pendulum motion and a theory of [[curve]]s. In the second part of the book, Huygens states three hypotheses on the motion of bodies. They are essentially the law of [[inertia]] and the law of composition of "motion". He uses these three rules to re-derive Galileo's original study of falling bodies, based on clearer logical framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last =Ducheyne|first=Steffen|date =2008|url =http://scielo.isciii.es/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0211-95362008000100011&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=es|title =Galileo and Huygens on free fall: Mathematical and methodological differences|journal =Dynamis : Acta Hispanica ad Medicinae Scientiarumque.

The fourth part of the book is concerned with the study of the center of oscillation. The derivations of propositions in this part is based on a single assumption: that the center of gravity of heavy objects cannot lift itself, which Huygens used as a virtual work principle. In the process, Huygens obtained solutions to dynamical problems such as the period of an oscillating pendulum as well as a [[compound pendulum]], [[Center of percussion|center of oscillation]] and its interchangeability with the pivot point, and the concept of [[moment of inertia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Fabio | last = Bevilaqua |author2=Lidia Falomo |author3=Lucio Fregonese |author4=Enrico Gianetto |author5=Franco Giudise |author6=Paolo Mascheretti  | title = The pendulum: From constrained fall to the concept of potential | booktitle = The Pendulum: Scientific, Historical, Philosophical, and Educational Perspectives | pages = 195–200  | publisher = Springer | year = 2005 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3GV2NgDwtjMC&amp;pg=PA195 | isbn = 1-4020-3525-X | accessdate = 2008-02-26}} gives a detailed description of Huygen's methods&lt;/ref&gt; The last part of the book gives propositions regarding bodies in uniform circular motion, without proof, and states the laws of [[centrifugal force]] for uniform circular motion.&lt;ref name="huygen"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/huygenscontents.html | title=Horologium Oscillatorium (An English translation by Ian Bruce)| date =  August 2013 | accessdate=14 November 2013 | author=Huygens, Christian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ibrahim al-Fazari''' (died 777 CE) was an 8th-century [[Banu Ghatafan|Arab]] mathematician and astronomer at the [[Abbasid]] court of the Caliph [[Al-Mansur]] (r.&amp;nbsp;754–775). He should not to be confused with his son [[Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm al-Fazārī]], also an astronomer. He composed various astronomical writings ("on the [[astrolabe]]", "on the armillary spheres", "on the calendar").

The Caliph ordered him and his son to translate the Indian astronomical text, The ''[[Sindhind]]'' along with [[Yaʿqūb ibn Ṭāriq]], which was completed in Baghdad about 750 CE, and entitled ''Az-Zīj ‛alā Sinī al-‛Arab''.  This translation was possibly the vehicle by means of which the [[Hindu numerals]] were transmitted from India to Iran.

At the end of the eighth century, while at the court of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], this Arab geographer mentioned [[Ghana]], "the land of gold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levtzion|first1=Nehemia|title=Ancient Ghana and Mali|date=1973|publisher=Methuen &amp; Co Ltd|location=New York|isbn=0841904316|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

  | publisher = Libraries Unlimited | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the production, dissemination, and use of all forms of information, regardless of its form or origin.

The term informetrics ([[French language|French]]: ''Informetrie'') was coined by Nacke in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Nacke  | first = O.  | title = Informetrie: eine neuer Name für eine neue Disziplin  | journal = Nachrichten für Dokumentation  | volume = 30  | issue = 6  | pages = 219–226  | year = 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Quantitative analysis of bibliographic data was pioneered by [[Robert K. Merton]] in an article called ''Science, Technology, and Society in [[Early modern Britain|Seventeenth Century England]]'' and originally published by Merton in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Merton, Robert K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4784">'''Intelligent control''' is a class of [[Control theory|control]] techniques that use various [[artificial intelligence]] computing approaches like [[artificial neural networks|neural networks]], [[Bayesian probability]], [[fuzzy logic]], [[machine learning]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://engineering.purdue.edu/ManLab/control/intell_control.htm|title= Intelligent control}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Intelligent control can be divided into the following major sub-domains:
* [[Neural network]] control
* [[Machine learning control]]
* [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] control
* [[Fuzzy control]]
* [[Neuro-fuzzy]] control
* [[Expert System]]s
* [[Genetic algorithm|Genetic control]]
* [[Intelligent agent]]s (Cognitive/Conscious control)

New control techniques are created continuously as new models of intelligent behavior are created and computational methods developed to support them.

=== Neural network controllers ===
[[Neural networks]] have been used to solve problems in almost all spheres of science and technology. Neural network control basically involves two steps:

* System identification
* Control

It has been shown that a [[Feed forward (control)|feedforward]] network with nonlinear, continuous and differentiable activation functions have [[universal approximation theorem|universal approximation]] capability. [[recurrent neural network|Recurrent]] networks have also been used for system identification. Given, a set of input-output data pairs, system identification aims to form a mapping among these data pairs. Such a network is supposed to capture the dynamics of a system.

=== Bayesian controllers ===
[[Bayesian probability]] has produced a number of algorithms that are in common use in many advanced control systems, serving as [[State space (controls)|state space]]  [[estimator]]s of some variables that are used in the controller.

The [[Kalman filter]] and the [[Particle filter]] are two examples of popular Bayesian control components. The Bayesian approach to controller design often requires an important effort in deriving the so-called system model and measurement model, which are the mathematical relationships linking the state variables to the sensor measurements available in the controlled system. In this respect, it is very closely linked to the
[[Systems theory|system-theoretic approach]] to [[Control engineering|control design]].

'''"Irresistible Force"''' is the second [[single (music)|single]] from American [[alternative rock]] band [[Jane's Addiction]]'s fourth studio album, [[The Great Escape Artist]]. The song was released on August 3, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.janesaddiction.com/releases/irresistible_force | title=Jane's Addiction - Irresistible Force | publisher=janesaddicition.com | accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical style and lyrics==
The song features [[TV on the Radio]] member and [[multi-instrumentalist]] [[Dave Sitek]] on guitar and bass guitar. It is less [[rock music|rock]]-laden than the previous Jane's Addiction single, "[[End to the Lies]]", and focuses more on [[synthesizer|synth]]-aided textures and atmospheric [[soundscape]]s.&lt;ref name="billboard"/&gt; The song starts with a [[spoken word]] intro and continues on [[verse-chorus form]], which is accompanied by a guitar solo by Dave Navarro.&lt;ref name="billboard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rollingstone"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/songreviews/irresistible-force-20110803 | title=Jane's Addiction - "Irresistible Force" | publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] | accessdate=May 10, 2013 | author=[[Will Hermes|Hermes, Will]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verses, which were built around "[[drone music|droning]] [[funk]]" and "the rubbery basslines" were also noted.&lt;ref name="rollingstone"/&gt;

Lyrically, the song contains references to the [[irresistible force paradox]].&lt;ref name="billboard"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jim-YANOn5AC&amp;dq=%22Irresistible+Force%22+%22jane's+addiction%22&amp;hl=tr&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=Jane's Addiction- Irresistible Force | journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=October–December 2011 | volume=123 | issue=35 | pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[CNN]], the lyricist [[Perry Farrell]] indicated that "the song chronicles how the universe was created", while the drummer [[Stephen Perkins]] described it as "what pulls him, Dave and Perry together".&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/11/showbiz/music/janes-addiction-new-album | title='Irresistible Force' brings Jane's Addiction back together | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=October 11, 2011 | accessdate=May 10, 2013 | author=Quan, Denise}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Will Hermes]] of [[Rolling Stone]] also commented on the song's lyrics, describing it as "Perry Farrell sounding like [[Carl Sagan]] in an episode of [[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]], musing ominously about the stars and some sort of [[Big Bang|big bang]]."&lt;ref name="rollingstone"/&gt;

==Reception and release==
The critical reception for the song was positive.&lt;ref name="billboard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/janes-addiction-irresistible-force-song-review/ | title=Jane's Addiction, ‘Irresistible Force’ – song review | publisher=Ultimate Classic Rock | date=August 2, 2011 | accessdate=May 10, 2013 | author=Wilkening, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Launch of Space Shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' on 12 April 1981 at Pad 39A for mission [[STS-1]]]]

The [[Space Shuttle]] was a partially reusable [[low Earth orbit]]al [[spacecraft]] system operated by the U.S. [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA).  Its official program name was Space Transportation System (STS), taken from a 1969 plan for [[Space Transportation System|a system of reusable spacecraft]] of which it was the only item funded for development.&lt;ref name=intro-taskGroup&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/taskgrp.html |title=Report of the Space Task Group, 1969 |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operational missions launched numerous [[satellite]]s, conducted science experiments in orbit, and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). The first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981, leading to operational flights beginning in 1982.

From 1981 to 2011 a total of 135 missions were flown, all launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. During that time period the fleet logged 1,322 days, 19 hours, 21 minutes and 23 seconds of flight time.&lt;ref name="intro-ShuttleByNumbers"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/12376-nasa-space-shuttle-program-facts-statistics.html | title=NASA's Space Shuttle By the Numbers: 30 Years of a Spaceflight Icon | publisher=[[Space.com]] | date=21 July 2011 | accessdate=18 June 2014 | author=Malik, Tarik}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longest orbital flight of the shuttle was [[STS-80]] at 17 days 15 hours, while the shortest flight was [[STS-51-L]] at one minute 13 seconds when the Space Shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' broke apart during launch. The shuttles docked with Russian space station ''[[Mir]]'' nine times and visited the ISS thirty-seven times. The highest altitude (apogee) achieved by the shuttle was 350 miles when servicing the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].&lt;ref name="intro-forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2012/04/18/5-horrifying-facts-you-didnt-know-about-the-space-shuttle/2/ |title=5 Horrifying Facts You Didn't Know About the Space Shuttle |author=Pinchefsky, Carol |work=[[Forbes]] |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program flew a total of 355 people representing 16 countries.&lt;ref name="intro-nasafacts"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/566250main_2011.07.05%20SHUTTLE%20ERA%20FACTS.pdf |title=Space Shuttle Era Facts |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |year=2011 |format=PDF |accessdate=6 January 2015 |id=FS-2011-7-142-KSC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kennedy Space Center served as the landing site for 78 missions, while 54 missions landed at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]] and 1 mission landed at [[White Sands, New Mexico|White Sands]], [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="intro-launch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/ |title=Space Shuttle Launch and Landing |author1=Ryba, Jeanne |author2=Brian Dunbar |date=11 September 2012 |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built solely for [[Approach and Landing Tests|atmospheric flight tests]] and had no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''Challenger'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. ''Challenger'' and ''Columbia'' were destroyed in mission accidents in 1986 and 2003 respectively, killing a total of fourteen astronauts. A fifth operational orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of [[STS-135]] by ''Atlantis'' on 21 July 2011.{{sfn|Jenkins|p=524}}

==Flight numbering==
[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|thumb|Profiles of all five orbiters at launch.]]

The U.S. Space Shuttle program was officially referred to as the Space Transportation System (STS). Specific shuttle missions were therefore designated with the prefix "STS".&lt;ref name="intro-ShuttleByNumbers" /&gt; Initially, the launches were given sequential numbers indicating order of launch, such as [[STS-7]].  Subsequent to the [[Apollo&amp;nbsp;13]] mishap, due to [[NASA Administrator]] [[James&amp;nbsp;M. Beggs]]'s [[triskaidekaphobia]] and consequent unwillingness to number [[STS-41-C|a&amp;nbsp;forthcoming flight]] as STS-13,&lt;ref name="numbering-crippenoh"&gt;{{cite web |format=PDF |url = http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/CrippenRL/CrippenRL_5-26-06.pdf |title=Robert L.

A. van Hoften |work=NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project |publisher=[[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] |date=5 December 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning in 1984, each mission was assigned a code, such as [[STS-41-B]], with the first digit indicating the federal [[fiscal year]] offset into the program (so 41-B was scheduled for FY 1984, 51-L originally for FY 1985 and the third flight in FY 1995 would have been named 151-C), the second digit indicating the launch site (1&amp;nbsp;was [[Kennedy Space Center]] and 2 was [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|Space Launch Complex (SLC)&amp;nbsp;6]] at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], although Vandenberg was never used), and the letter indicating scheduling sequence.&lt;ref name="numbering-spacefacts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/12127-8-surprising-space-shuttle-facts.html |title=8 Surprising Space Shuttle Facts |author=Norton, Lily |date=30 June 2011|publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These codes were assigned when the launches were initially scheduled and were not changed as missions were delayed or rescheduled.{{sfn|Jenkins|p=524}} The codes were adopted from STS-41-B through STS-51-L (although the highest code used was actually [[STS-61-C]]), and the sequential numbers were used internally at NASA on all processing paperwork.

After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]], NASA returned to using a sequential numbering system, with the number counting from the beginning of the STS program. Unlike the initial system, however, the numbers were assigned based on the initial mission schedule, and did not always reflect actual launch order. This numbering scheme started at 26, with the first flight as STS-26R—the R suffix stood for "reflight" to disambiguate from prior missions. The suffix was used for two years through STS-33R, then the R was dropped.{{sfn|Jenkins|p=524}} As a result of the changes in systems, flights under different numbering systems could have the same number with one having a letter appended, e.g. flight [[STS-51]] (a mission carried out by [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] in 1993) was many years after [[STS-51-A]] (''Discovery's'' second flight in 1984).{{sfn|Jenkins|p=524}}

==Cancelled missions==
{{main article|Canceled Space Shuttle missions}}
One initial [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Intact abort modes|emergency flight abort (RTLS)]] [[sub-orbital spaceflight|sub-orbital]] test mission was canceled due to high risk. Many other planned missions were canceled due to the late development of the shuttle, and the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'']] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'']] disasters.

Four missions were cut short by a day or more while in orbit: [[STS-2]] (equipment failure),{{sfn|Chen|p=11}} [[STS-35]] (weather),&lt;ref name="sts35-nasaarchive" /&gt; [[STS-44]] (equipment failure),{{sfn|Chen|p=173}} and [[STS-83]] (equipment failure, relaunched as [[STS-94]]).{{sfn|Chen|p=173}}

==Contingency missions==
[[File:Space shuttles Atlantis (STS-125) and Endeavour (STS-400) on launch pads.jpg|thumb|right|''Atlantis'' and ''Endeavour'' on LC-39A and LC-39B. ''Endeavour'' was slated to launch for [[STS-400]] rescue mission should ''Atlantis'' ([[STS-125]]) be found unable to return safely to Earth.]]
{{Main article|STS-3xx}}
[[STS-3xx|STS-300]] was the designation for the [[Space Shuttle]] Launch on Need (LON) missions to be launched on short notice for [[STS-114]] and [[STS-121]], in the event that the shuttle became disabled or damaged and could not safely return to Earth.&lt;ref name="contingency-cscs"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/153444main_CSCS_Resource_%20Book.pdf|title=Contingency Shuttle Crew Support (CSCS)/Rescue Flight Resource Book|accessdate=25 November 2008|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=2005|author=NASA|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="contingency-frr"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/150494main_frr_brief_20060617.pdf|title=Flight Readiness Review Briefing Transcript|accessdate=25 November 2008|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=2005|author=NASA|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="contingency-cscsNumbers"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/04/nasa-sets-new-launch-date-targets-through-to-sts-124/|title=NASA Sets New Launch Date Targets Through to STS-124 |accessdate=2 September 2010 |publisher=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |date=15 April 2007 |first=Chris |last=Bergin |work=CSCS flight numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rescue flight for [[STS-115]], if needed, would have been STS-301. After STS-115, the rescue mission designations were based on the corresponding regular mission that would be replaced should the rescue mission be needed. For example, the [[STS-116]] rescue mission was branded STS-317, because the normal mission scheduled after STS-116 was [[STS-117]]. Should the rescue mission have been needed, the crew and vehicle for STS-117 would assume the rescue mission profile and become STS-317. All potential rescue missions were to be launched with a crew of four, and would return with ten or eleven crew members, depending on the number of crew launched on the rescued shuttle. Missions were expected to last approximately eleven days. None of the planned contingency missions was ever flown.&lt;ref name="contingency-sts335"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/05/sts-335-nasa-planning-contingency-launch-on-need-mission/ |title=STS-335: NASA Continues Planning for Contingency Launch On Need Mission |author=Gebhardt, Chris |date= 31 May 2010 |accessdate=29 December 2014 |publisher=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No contingency mission was planned for [[STS-135]], the final shuttle mission.  Instead, NASA planned to effect any required rescues one-by-one, using Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]].&lt;ref name="contingency-abcnews"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ned|first=Potter|title=NASA Space Shuttle: Only Four Astronauts on Final Launch From Cape Canaveral |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/nasas-space-shuttle-risky-missions-atlantis-flight/story?id=14030398 |accessdate=8 July 2011 |newspaper=[[ABC News]] |date=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Rollback" is the term NASA uses when the Space Shuttle was rolled back from the [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|launch pad]] atop the [[Mobile Launcher Platform]] and [[Crawler-transporter]] to the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB). A variety of factors could require a rollback, from severe weather to the need for repairs that could not be performed at the launch pad.

| ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''
| [[STS-125]]
| Payload
| ''Atlantis'' was moved back to the VAB to allow time to troubleshoot a problem with the Hubble Space Telescope on orbit. Hardware to correct the problem was added to the [[STS-125]] mission payload. ''Atlantis'' was then successfully launched on May 11, 2009.
|-
| 20
| 2010-12-17
| ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]''
| [[STS-133]]
| External tank repairs
| ''Discovery'' rolled off the launch pad after insulating foam and two structural stringers on the external tank cracked during a launch attempt on November 5, 2010.  The repair effort lasted two months as engineers beefed up the structural integrity of the structural members in question and replaced the foam that was removed to facilitate those repairs.  The mission lifted off on February 24, 2011.  The external tank performed flawlessly during fueling and launch.

[[Image:Volcanic zones of Iceland.svg|thumb|right|Volcanism in Iceland]]

Iceland has four volcanic zones: [[Reykjanes]] (Reykjanes Ridge, the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] South of Iceland), West and North Volcanic Zones (RVZ, WVZ, NVZ) and the East Volcanic Zone (EVZ), ([[Westman Islands]]). The Mid-Iceland Belt (MIB) connects them across central Iceland. There are two intraplate belts too ([[Öræfajökull]] (ÖVB) and [[Snæfellsnes]] (SVB)). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors= T.

'''Luigi Torchi''' invented the first direct multiplication machine in [[1834]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://history-computer.com/MechanicalCalculators/19thCentury/Torchi.html Luigi Torchi] History of Computers and Computing&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the second key-driven machine in the world, following that of James White ([[1822]])&lt;ref name="Roegel"&gt;[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7763737 Roegel, Denis. "Before Torchi and Schwilgué, There Was White." IEEE Annals of the History of Computing 38.4 (2016): 92-93.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Very little is known about the inventor and the machine. We only know that he was a carpenter; his machine was awarded of a gold metal from the Imperial-regio istituto lombardo di scienze, lettere e arti in [[Milan]] in 1834. A document of such occasion provides the known details of the machine, where a second document shows a drawing of the machine itself. However, no detailed documents about how it worked are known to exist.

The machine was exhibited in Brera between 1834 and [[1837]]; it was later found by [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] in bad conditions. After that, are not known further information about the machine.

In [[electromagnetism]], the '''magnetic susceptibility''' ([[Latin]]: {{lang|la|susceptibilis}}, "receptive"; denoted {{mvar|{{nounderlines|[[chi (letter)|χ]]}}}}) is one measure of the magnetic properties of a material.  The susceptibility indicates whether a material is attracted into or repelled out of a magnetic field, which in turn has implications for practical applications.  Quantitative measures of the magnetic susceptibility also provide insights into the structure of materials, providing insight into [[Chemical bond|bonding]] and [[energy level]]s.

If the magnetic susceptibility is greater than zero, the substance is said to be "[[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]]"; the magnetization of the substance is higher than that of empty space.  If the magnetic susceptibility is less than zero, the substance is "[[Diamagnetism|diamagnetic]]"; it tends to exclude a magnetic field from its interior.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Grinter, ''The Quantum in Chemistry: An Experimentalist's View'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005, {{ISBN|0470017627}} page 364&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically it is the ratio of magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} (magnetic moment per unit volume) to the applied magnetizing field intensity {{math|'''H'''}}.

==Definition==
{{see also|Permeability (electromagnetism)#Relative permeability and magnetic susceptibility}}

=== Volume susceptibility ===
Magnetic susceptibility is a dimensionless proportionality constant that indicates the degree of [[magnetization]] of a material in response to an applied [[magnetic field]]. A related term is '''magnetizability''', the proportion between [[magnetic moment]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic flux density]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1997 |title =magnetizability, {{mvar|ξ}} |encyclopedia=IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology—The Gold Book |publisher=[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |edition=2nd |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/search.py?search_text=magnetizability}}&lt;/ref&gt; A closely related parameter is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]], which expresses the total magnetization of material and volume.

The ''volume magnetic susceptibility'', represented by the symbol {{mvar|χ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;}} (often simply {{mvar|χ}}, sometimes {{mvar|χ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;– magnetic, to distinguish from the [[electric susceptibility]]), is defined in the [[International System of Units]]&amp;nbsp;— in other systems there may be additional constants — by the following relationship:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Handley|first1=Robert C.|title=Modern Magnetic Materials|date=2000|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=9780471155669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M} = \chi_v \mathbf{H}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here
*{{math|'''M'''}} is the [[magnetization]] of the material (the [[magnetic dipole moment]] per unit volume), measured in [[ampere]]s per meter, and
*{{math|'''H'''}} is the [[Effective magnetic field|magnetic field strength]], also measured in amperes per meter.

{{mvar|χ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;}} is therefore a [[dimensionless quantity]].

Using [[SI electromagnetism units|SI units]], the [[magnetic field|magnetic induction]] {{math|'''B'''}} is related to {{math|'''H'''}} by the relationship

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} \ = \ \mu_0\left(\mathbf{H} + \mathbf{M}\right) \ = \ \mu_0\left(1 + \chi_v\right) \mathbf{H} \ = \ \mu \mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[vacuum permeability]] (see table of [[physical constant]]s), and {{math|(1 + ''χ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)#Relative permeability and magnetic susceptibility|relative permeability]] of the material. Thus the ''volume magnetic susceptibility'' {{mvar|χ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the [[magnetic permeability]] {{mvar|μ}} are related by the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \mu_0\left(1 + \chi_v\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard A. Clarke |url=http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/mu/#itns |title=Magnetic properties of materials |publisher=Info.ee.surrey.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; an auxiliary quantity called ''intensity of magnetization'' {{math|'''I'''}} (also referred to as ''magnetic polarisation'' {{math|'''J'''}}) and measured in [[Tesla (unit)|teslas]], is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I} = \mu_0 \mathbf{M} .&lt;/math&gt;

This allows an alternative description of all magnetization phenomena in terms of the quantities {{math|'''I'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}}, as opposed to the commonly used {{math|'''M'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}}.

=== Mass susceptibility and molar susceptibility ===
There are two other measures of susceptibility, the ''mass magnetic susceptibility'' ({{math|''χ''&lt;sub&gt;mass&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|''χ''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;}}, sometimes {{math|''χ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}}), measured in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/kg (SI) and the ''[[Mole (unit)|molar]] magnetic susceptibility'' ({{math|''χ''&lt;sub&gt;mol&lt;/sub&gt;}}) measured in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mol that are defined below, where {{mvar|ρ}} is the [[density]] in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and {{mvar|M}} is [[molar mass]] in kg/mol:

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_\text{mass} = \frac{\chi_v}{\rho} &lt;/math&gt;;
:&lt;math&gt;\chi_\text{mol} = M\chi_\text{mass} = \frac{M\chi_v}{\rho}

&lt;/math&gt;.

=== In CGS units ===
Note that the definitions above are according to [[International System of Units|SI]] conventions. However, many tables of magnetic susceptibility give [[Centimetre gram second system of units|cgs]] values (more specifically [[Centimetre gram second system of units#Electromagnetic units (EMU)|emu-cgs]], short for electromagnetic units, or [[Gaussian units|Gaussian-cgs]]; both are the same in this context). These units rely on a different definition of the permeability of free space:&lt;ref name="bennett"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bennett, L. H.|author2=Page, C. H.|author3=Swartzendruber, L. J.|last-author-amp=yes|year=1978|title=Comments on units in magnetism|journal=Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards|publisher=[[NIST]], USA|volume=83|issue=1|pages=9–12|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}^\text{cgs} \ = \ \mathbf{H}^\text{cgs} + 4\pi\mathbf{M}^\text{cgs} \ = \ \left(1 + 4\pi\chi_v^\text{cgs}\right) \mathbf{H}^\text{cgs}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[dimensionless]] cgs value of volume susceptibility is multiplied by 4{{pi}} to give the dimensionless [[International System of Units|SI]] volume susceptibility value:&lt;ref name="bennett" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_v^\text{SI} = 4\pi\chi_v^\text{cgs}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the cgs volume magnetic susceptibility of water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C is {{val|-7.19e-7}}, which is {{val|-9.04e-6}} using the [[International System of Units|SI]] convention.

In physics it is common to see cgs mass susceptibility given in cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/g or emu/g·Oe&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, so to convert to SI volume susceptibility we use the conversion &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=118&amp;Itemid=107|title=IEEE Magnetic unit conversions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_v^\text{SI} = 4\pi\,\rho^\text{cgs}\,\chi_m^\text{cgs}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;cgs&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the density given in g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, or

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_v^\text{SI} = \left(4\pi \times 10^{-3}\right)\,\rho^{\rm SI}\,\chi_m^\text{cgs}&lt;/math&gt;.

The molar susceptibility is measured  cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mol or emu/mol·Oe&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in cgs and is calculated using the molar mass in g/mol.

==Paramagnetism and diamagnetism==
If {{mvar|χ}} is positive, a material can be [[paramagnetic]]. In this case, the magnetic field in the material is strengthened by the induced magnetization. Alternatively, if {{mvar|χ}} is negative, the material is [[diamagnetic]]. In this case, the magnetic field in the material is weakened by the induced magnetization. Generally, nonmagnetic materials are said to be para- or diamagnetic because they do not possess permanent magnetization without external magnetic field. [[Ferromagnetic]], [[ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnetic]], or [[antiferromagnetic]] materials possess permanent magnetization even without external magnetic field and do not have a well defined zero-field susceptibility.

==Experimental measurement==
Volume magnetic susceptibility is measured by the force change felt upon a substance when a magnetic field gradient is applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| author=L. N. Mulay
| title=Techniques of Chemistry
|editor1=A. Weissberger |editor2=B. W. Rossiter | publisher=Wiley-Interscience: New York
| volume=4
| page = 431
| year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early measurements are made using the [[Gouy balance]] where a sample is hung between the poles of an electromagnet. The change in weight when the electromagnet is turned on is proportional to the susceptibility. Today, high-end measurement systems use a [[superconductive]] magnet. An alternative is to measure the force change on a strong compact magnet upon insertion of the sample. This system, widely used today, is called the [[Evans balance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherwood-scientific.com/msb/msbindex.html |title=Magnetic Susceptibility Balances |publisher=Sherwood-scientific.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; For liquid samples, the susceptibility can be measured from the dependence of the [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] frequency of the sample on its shape or orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{

Another method using NMR techniques measures the magnetic field distortion around a sample immersed in water inside an MR scanner. This method is highly accurate for diamagnetic materials with susceptibilities similar to water.&lt;ref name="Wapler_JMR"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wapler|first1=M.

==Tensor susceptibility==
The magnetic susceptibility of most [[crystal]]s is not a scalar quantity. Magnetic response {{math|'''M'''}} is dependent upon the orientation of the sample and can occur in directions other than that of the applied field {{math|'''H'''}}. In these cases, volume susceptibility is defined as a [[tensor]]

:&lt;math&gt; M_i= H_j \chi_{ij}  &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} refer to the directions (e.g., {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in [[Cartesian coordinates]]) of the applied field and magnetization, respectively. The [[tensor]] is thus rank 2 (second order), dimension (3,3) describing the component of magnetization in the {{mvar|i}}th direction from the external field applied in the {{mvar|j}}th direction.

==Differential susceptibility==
In [[ferromagnetic]] crystals, the relationship between {{math|'''M'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}} is not linear. To accommodate this, a more general definition of ''differential susceptibility'' is used

:&lt;math&gt;\chi^{d}_{ij} = \frac{\partial M_i}{\partial H_j}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''χ''{{su|p=''d''|b=''ij''}}}} is a [[tensor]] derived from [[partial derivative]]s of components of {{math|'''M'''}} with respect to components of {{math|'''H'''}}. When the [[coercivity]] of the material parallel to an applied field is the smaller of the two, the differential susceptibility is a function of the applied field and self interactions, such as the [[magnetic anisotropy]]. When the material is not [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturated]], the effect will be nonlinear and dependent upon the [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain wall]] configuration of the material.

==In the frequency domain==
When the magnetic susceptibility is measured in response to an [[Alternating current|AC]] magnetic field (i.e. a magnetic field that varies sinusoidally), this is called ''AC susceptibility''. AC susceptibility (and the closely related "AC permeability") are [[complex number]] quantities, and various phenomena, such as resonance, can be seen in AC susceptibility that cannot in constant-field ([[Direct current|DC]]) susceptibility. In particular, when an AC field is applied perpendicular to the detection direction (called the "transverse susceptibility" regardless of the frequency), the effect has a peak at the [[ferromagnetic resonance]] frequency of the material with a given static applied field. Currently, this effect is called the ''microwave permeability'' or ''network ferromagnetic resonance'' in the literature. These results are sensitive to the [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain wall]] configuration of the material and [[eddy currents]].

In terms of [[ferromagnetic resonance]], the effect of an AC-field applied along the direction of the magnetization is called ''parallel pumping''.

==Sources of confusion in published data==
The [[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]] has one of the only published magnetic susceptibility tables. Some of the data (e.g., for [[aluminium]], [[bismuth]], and [[diamond]]) is listed as cgs, which has caused confusion to some readers. "cgs" is an abbreviation of ''centimeters–grams–seconds''; it represents the form of the units, but cgs does not specify units. Correct units of magnetic susceptibility in cgs is cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mol or cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/g. '''Molar susceptibility''' and '''mass susceptibility''' are both listed in the CRC.  Some table have listed magnetic susceptibility of diamagnets as positives. It is important to check the header of the table for the correct units and sign of magnetic susceptibility readings.

In theoretical linguistics, '''mirror theory''' refers to a particular approach to the architecture of the language organ developed by [[Michael Brody]], who claims his theory to be purely representational (unlike most of the current generative theories that are either derivational or combining derivation and representation).

==Phrase Structure==
There are several important respects in which '''mirror theory''' is different from more traditional theories of phrase structure in [[generative linguistics]] such as [[X-bar theory]] or [[bare phrase structure]]. The first principle, called ''mirror'', states that the syntactic relation 'X complement of Y' is identical to an inverse-order morphological relation 'X specifier of Y'. Thus, the notions of 'syntactic' and 'morphological' specifiers and complements are crucial for the linearisation of syntactic structure and its mapping to the morphological component.

When the structure is pronounced, it linearises in the following order: specifiers precede heads, and heads precede their complements. So when a sentence like that in the diagram below is pronounced, 'John' precedes the V-v-T chain, which in turn precedes 'Mary', the latter being the specifier of V. However, English is a VO language, which means that the morphological word 'loves' associated with the V-v-T chain is spelled in v, deriving the correct word order.

== The Mirror Principle in Distributed Morphology ==
Similar to mirror theory is the '''Mirror Principle''' of the [[Distributed morphology|Distributed Morphology]] framework that deals primarily with issues of affix ordering.&lt;ref&gt;Halle, Morris &amp; Alec Marantz. 1993.  'Distributed Morphology and the Pieces of Inflection.'  In The View from Building 20, ed. Kenneth Hale and S. Jay Keyser.  MIT Press, Cambridge, 111-176.&lt;/ref&gt; In the model of Distributed Morphology, the underlying assumption is such that all morphemes in a morphologically complex word are effectually "leaves" on a syntactic tree. These syntactic "leaves" undergo operations that lead to the build-up of words, meaning that word-formation is subject to the same principles that govern the syntactic build-up of sentences. The mirror principle surmises that a complex word is generated in a derivation with the [[Root (linguistics)|root]] of a given word merging lower than all subsequent [[suffix]]es that attach to that word. These suffixes immediately c-command the root word and are ordered in accordance with the principle of semantic scope; morphemes that have scope over other parts of a words. To generate the proper linear structure, '''[[Left-Head Movement]]''' is applied recursively to include the morphemes that [[c-command]] a given root.

Empirical arguments for the Mirror Principle are provided by Baker's (1985) account for the distribution of a number of valence changing operations in [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], showing that the linear order of morphemes is related to the syntactic hierarchy in that morphemes are linearized in a reverse order to how they appear in a syntactic structure. His findings are summarized in ''The Mirror Generalization'', which states:  &lt;blockquote&gt;'''''Morphological derivations must directly reflect syntactic derivations (and vice versa).'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The mirror principle and morphosyntactic explanation|last = Baker|first = Mark|date = 1985|journal = Linguistic Inquiry 16: 373-415|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The generalization is observed in Baker's (1988) account for [[Applicative voice|applicatives]] and [[Passive voice|passives]] in [[Chewa language|Chichewa]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Incorporation: A theory of grammatical function changing|last = Baker|first = Mark|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 1988|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above examples attest the ordering of the applicative morpheme and the passive morpheme in Chichewa. In this language, applicatives may be passivized, however, passives can not be made into applicatives. Applying the Mirror Principle to this set of data, we assume that in the underlying deep structure of the syntax, all affixes that occur to the right of the lexical root ''perek'' are projected above this root in the syntax. These affixes are then adjoined to the lexical root via head-movement.

== Alternative accounts for affix ordering ==
Numerous observations in languages are also available, apart from the mirror principle. [[Yupik languages|Yupik]], for example, is able to account for affix order appealing entirely to semantic scope. However, semantic scope and the mirror principle are not mutually exclusive ways to account for affix ordering

Challenges to the Mirror Principle have been offered in analyses of the morpheme orders of [[Navajo language|Navajo]] and [[Cupeño language|Cupeño]] by Harley (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001534/current.pdf|title = Affixation and the Mirror Principle|date = July 19, 2009|accessdate = |website = Lingbuzz|publisher = |last = Harley|first = Heidi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure IV. Constants of Diatomic Molecules''''', by K. P. Huber and [[Gerhard Herzberg]] (Van nostrand Reinhold company, New York, 1979, {{ISBN|0-442-23394-9}}), is a classic comprehensive multidisciplinary reference text contains a critical compilation of available data for all [[diatomic molecules]] and [[ion]]s known at the time of publication - over 900 diatomic species in all - including electronic energies, vibrational and rotational constants, and observed transitions. Extensive footnotes discuss the reliability of these data and additional detailed informationon potential energy curves, spin-coupling constants, /\-type doubling, perturbations between electronic states, hyperfine structure, rotational g factors, [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moments]], radiative lifetimes, oscillator strengths, dissociation energies and ionization potentials when available, and other aspects. Herzberg received the 1971 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]; both authors are world-renowned highly respected scientists.

Mongoose-V was developed by [[Synova|Synova, Inc.]] of [[Melbourne, Florida|Melbourne]], [[Florida]], [[United States|USA]], with support from the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].

The Mongoose-V processor first flew on NASA's [[Earth Observing-1]] (EO-1) satellite launched in November 2000 where it functioned as the main flight computer. A second Mongoose-V controlled the satellite's solid-state data recorder.

The Mongoose-V requires 5 volts and is packaged into a 256-pin ceramic quad flatpack ([[CQFP]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=57.3.2 Synova Inc Mongoose V|publisher=Extreme Environment Electronics|isbn=9781439874318|page=660-661|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-gLSBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA661&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of spacecraft that use the Mongoose-V include:
* Earth Observing-1 (EO-1)
* NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP), launched in June 2001, carried a Mongoose-V flight computer similar to that on EO-1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1908">Dr. '''Nathaniel Thomas Wetherell''' [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|MRCS]] [[Geological Society of London|FGS]] (September 6, 1800 – December 22, 1875) was a British [[geology|geologist]] and [[surgeon]]. His work involved the collection of various [[fossil]]s found in England.  He was born, lived, and died in [[Highgate]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Wetherell, Nathaniel Thomas|volume=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wetherell discovered a strange mixture of rocks and fossils of northern provenance in [[Coldfall Wood]], [[Muswell Hill]] in 1835. This led subsequently to the recognition that [[Glacier#Moraines|glaciation]] had affected southern England.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, H.

The organizational [[Meta learning|deutero-learning]] concept identified by Argyris and Schon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Deutero-learning in organizations: Learning for|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0090261675900017|journal = Organizational Dynamics|date = 1975-01-01|pages = 2–16|volume = 4|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/0090-2616(75)90001-7|first = Donald A.|last = Schon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Organizational Learning: A Theory of Action Perspective: 001|publisher = Addison Wesley Longman Publishing Co|date = 1978-05-18|location = Reading, Mass|isbn = 9780201001747|first = Chris|last = Argyris|first2 = Donald A.|last2 = Schon}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines when organizations learn how to carry out single-loop and [[double-loop learning]]. It has also been described as learning how to learn&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = PRESKILL: EVALUATIVE INQUIRY FOR|publisher = Sage Publications, Incorporated|date = 1998-10-20|location = Thousand Oaks, Calif|isbn = 9780761904540|first = Hallie|last = Preskill}}&lt;/ref&gt; through a process of [[Cooperative inquiry|collaborative inquiry]] and reflection (evaluative inquiry).

''"When an organization engages in deutero-learning its members learn about the previous context for learning. They reflect on and inquire into previous episodes of organizational learning, or failure to learn. They discover what they did that facilitated or inhibited learning, they invent new strategies for learning, they produce these strategies, and they evaluate and generalize what they have produced"'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Learning what facilitates and inhibits learning enables organizations to develop new strategies to develop their knowledge. For example, identification of a gap between perceived performance (such as satisfaction) and actual performance (outcomes) creates an awareness that makes the organization understand that learning needs to occur, driving appropriate changes to the environment and processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Organizational Learning - Knowledge Center|url = http://www.12manage.com/methods_organizational_learning.html|website = www.12manage.com|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Learning prototypes ==
Wijnhoven (2001) grouped four learning prototypes that best meet learning needs, the match between these needs and learning norms dictating an organization's learning capabilities; deutero-learning is the acquisition of these capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Acquiring Organizational Learning Norms A Contingency Approach for Understanding Deutero Learning|url = http://mlq.sagepub.com/content/32/2/181|journal = Management Learning|date = 2001-06-01|issn = 1350-5076|pages = 181–200|volume = 32|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/1350507601322002|first = Fons|last = Wijnhoven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminological ambiguities ==
Organizational metacognition and organizational deutero-learning have both been described as the concept or phenomenon where organizations learn how to learn.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Argyris and Schon (1978) place deutero-learning into their cognitive theory of action framework, neglecting aspects of adaptive behaviour and context core to [[Gregory Bateson|Bateson’s]] (1972) original definitions. In order to resolve terminological ambiguities, Visser (2007) reviewed and reformulated the concept of deutero-learning as, "''the behavioral adaptation to patterns of conditioning in relationships in organizational contexts, distinguishing it from meta-learning and planned learning''" (pg. 659).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Deutero-Learning in Organizations: A Review and a Reformulation|url = http://amr.aom.org/content/32/2/659|journal = Academy of Management Review|date = 2007-04-01|issn = 0363-7425|pages = 659–667|volume = 32|issue = 2|doi = 10.5465/AMR.2007.24351883|first = Max|last = Visser|hdl = 2066/19481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
Organizational metacognition is considered a key norm to the prescriptive concept of the [[learning organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = 2nd Revised|title = The Fifth Discipline: The art and practice of the learning organization: Second edition|publisher = Random House Business|date = 2006-04-06|location = London|isbn = 9781905211203|first = Peter M.|last = Senge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sensemaking in Organizations|publisher = SAGE Publications, Inc|date = 1995-07-20|location = Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn = 9780803971776|first = Karl E.|last = Weick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its significance has been recognized by industry, the military&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and in disaster response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Business professor receives funds to study disaster response|url = http://news.emory.edu/stories/2014/12/er_goizueta_prof_disaster_study/campus.html|website = news.emory.edu|date = 2014-12-30|accessdate = 2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples in practice ==
Examples of poor metacognition (deutero-learning) have been described in knowledge network environments,

''"Knowledge networking is important to most competitive enterprises today. Enterprise knowledge is becoming ever more specialized in nature, so no single person or organization can know everything in detail. Hence addressing complex, multidisciplinary problems requires developing and accessing a network of knowledgeable people and organizations. The problem is, many otherwise knowledgeable people and organizations are not fully aware of their knowledge networks, and even more problematic, they are not aware that they are not aware. This focuses our attention toward organizational metacognition."'' &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Developed by [[James Duesenberry]], the '''relative income hypothesis''' states that an individual’s attitude to [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] and [[saving]] is dictated more by his income in relation to others than by abstract [[standard of living]]; the percentage of income consumed by an individual depends on his percentile position within the income distribution.

Secondly, it hypothesizes that the present consumption is not influenced merely by present levels of absolute and relative income, but also by levels of consumption attained in a previous period. It is difficult for a family to reduce a level of consumption once attained. The aggregate ratio of consumption to income is assumed to depend on the level of present income relative to past peak income.

'''SA-4''' was the fourth launch of a [[Saturn I]] launch vehicle and the last of the initial test phase of the first stage. It was part of the [[Project Apollo|Apollo Program]].

==Objectives==
SA-4 was the last flight to test only the S-I first stage of the Saturn I rocket. As with the first three launches this would be a suborbital flight and would test the structural integrity of the rocket.

The major addition to this flight was that, in order to test the rocket's ability to deal with an engine failure during the flight, one of the engines would be programmed to shut down about 100 seconds after launch. If all went well the rocket would reroute the fuel for this engine to the other engines and have the rocket burn longer to compensate for the loss of acceleration. This was used successfully on the later [[Apollo 6]] and [[Apollo 13]] flights (both [[Saturn V]] rockets).

Also on this flight, the dummy second stage was outfitted with the aerodynamic design of the real second stage. This included vent ducts, fairings and dummy camera pods. The rocket also flew with antennae designed for the Block II version of the rocket.

==Flight==
[[Image:Saturn SA4 on launch pad.jpg|left|thumb|225px|SA-4 on [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Pad 34]]]]

After the shortest checkout time of any rocket at 54 days,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} SA-4 went on to experience the longest series of holds of any mission at 120 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The SA-4 launch would be the final single-stage flight.

The rocket operated perfectly through the first 100 seconds of the flight, when the No. 5 engine shut off as planned. The rocket then continued to operate properly, the propellant system rerouting the fuel to the other engines.  The No. 5 engine did not disintegrate because of heat caused by the lack of cooling propellant as some had predicted. This was an important test proving an important feature of the clustered engine design.

The rocket reached a maximum height of 129&amp;nbsp;km and a peak velocity of 5906&amp;nbsp;km per hour. At this stage it also fired retrorockets that would be used on later missions to separate the rocket stages. On SA-4 the stages were not designed to separate but tested the retrorockets to make sure they would fire.

==Life==
Wood went to sea in 1811 as a [[midshipman]] in the [[British East India Company]]'s service, which he left in 1826. He then settled at [[Hasketon]] near [[Woodbridge, Suffolk]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Wood devoted himself to a study of the [[mollusca]] of the Newer Tertiary (now [[Neogene]]) of [[Suffolk]] and [[Norfolk]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://neogenebryozoans.myspecies.info/eastangliancrags The East Anglian Crags | Neogene Bryozoa of Britain]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Older Tertiary ([[Eocene]]) of the [[Hampshire Basin]]. On the latter subject he published ''A Monograph of the Eocene Bivalves of England'' (1861–1871), issued by the [[Palaeontographical Society]]. His chief work was ''A Monograph of the Crag Mollusca'' (1848–1856), published by the same society, for which he was awarded the [[Wollaston medal]] in 1860 by the [[Geological Society of London]]; a supplement was issued by him in 1872-1874, a second in 1879, and a third (edited by his son) in 1882. He died at [[Martlesham]], near Woodbridge.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

His son, [[Searles Valentine Wood (1830-1884)]], was for some years a [[solicitor]] at Woodbridge, but gave up the profession and devoted his energies to [[geology]], studying especially the structure of the deposits of the [[cliff|crag]] and [[glacial]] drifts.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Social constructionism''' is  a [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] in [[sociology]] and [[communication theory]] that examines the development of jointly constructed understandings of the world that form the basis for shared assumptions about reality. The theory centers on the notion that meanings are developed in coordination with others rather than separately within each individual.&lt;ref&gt;Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (2009). Social construction of reality. In S. Littlejohn, &amp; K. Foss (Eds.), Encyclopedia of communication theory. (pp. 891). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. {{DOI|10.4135/9781412959384.n344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social constructionism questions what is defined by humans and society to be reality. Therefore, social constructs can be different based on the society and the events surrounding the time period in which they exist.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Mr. Sinn|title=Theoretical Perspectives: Social Constructionism|date=2016-02-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UrDIfdTRpo|accessdate=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a social construct is money or the concept of currency, as people in society have agreed to give it importance/ value.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Citation|last=khanacademymedicine|title=Social constructionism {{!}} Society and Culture {{!}} MCAT {{!}} Khan Academy|date=2013-09-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U2XAJNazik|accessdate=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a social construction is the concept of self/ self-identity. [[Charles Cooley]] stated based on his [[Looking-glass self|Looking-Glass-Self]] theory: "I am not who you think I am; I am not who I think I am; I am who I think you think I am."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This demonstrates how people in society construct ideas or concepts that may not exist without the existence of people or language to validate those concepts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lc23548.wordpress.com/social-constructionism/|title=Social constructionism|date=2017-12-04|work=Study Journal|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are weak and strong social constructs.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Weak social constructs rely on [[brute fact]]s (which are fundamental facts that are difficult to explain or understand, such as [[quark]]s) or institutional facts (which are formed from social conventions).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Strong social constructs rely on the human perspective and knowledge that doesn't just exist, but is rather constructed by society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Definition ==
A social construct or construction concerns the meaning, notion, or connotation placed on an object or event by a society, and adopted by the inhabitants of that society with respect to how they view or deal with the object or event.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In that respect, a social construct as an idea would be widely accepted as natural by the society.

A major focus of social constructionism is to uncover the ways in which individuals and groups participate in the construction of their perceived social reality. It involves looking at the ways [[social phenomena]] are developed, [[Institutionalization (disambiguation)|institutionalized]], known, and made into [[tradition]] by humans.

== Origins ==
In terms of background, social constructionism is rooted in "[[symbolic interactionism]]" and "phenomenology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/phenomenology/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=David Woodruff|last=Smith|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=29 May 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Social Construction of Leadership: A Sailing Guide|url = http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/24/2/171|journal = Management Communication Quarterly|date = 2010-05-01|issn = 0893-3189|pages = 171–210|volume = 24|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/0893318909359697|language = en|first = Gail T.|last = Fairhurst|first2 = David|last2 = Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Berger and Luckmann's ''The Social Construction of Reality'' published in 1966, this concept found its hold. More than four decades later, a sizable number of theory and research pledged to the basic tenet that people "make their social and cultural worlds at the same time these worlds make them."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; It is a viewpoint that uproots social processes "simultaneously playful and serious, by which reality is both revealed and concealed, created and destroyed by our activities."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; It provides a substitute to the "Western intellectual tradition" where the researcher "earnestly seeks certainty in a representation of reality by means of propositions."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In social constructionist terms, "taken-for-granted realities" are cultivated from "interactions between and among social agents;" furthermore, reality is not some objective truth "waiting to be uncovered through positivist scientific inquiry."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rather, there can be "multiple realities that compete for truth and legitimacy."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Social constructionism understands the "fundamental role of language and communication" and this understanding has "contributed to the linguistic turn" and more recently the "turn to [[discourse]] theory."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/janettie/discourse-theory|title=Discourse Theory|last=Janet Tibaldo|date=19 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of social constructionists abide by the belief that "language does not mirror reality; rather, it constitutes [creates] it."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

A broad definition of social constructionism has its supporters and critics in the organizational sciences.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; A constructionist approach to various organizational and managerial phenomena appear to be more commonplace and on the rise.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Andy Lock and Tomj Strong trace some of the fundamental tenets of social constructionism back to the work of the 18th century Italian political philosopher, rhetorician, historian, and jurist [[Giambattista Vico]].&lt;ref&gt;Andy Lock and Tom Strong.2010. ''Social Constructionism: Sources and Stirrings in Theory and Practice''. Cambridge University Press, pp. 12-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger and Luckmann give credit to [[Max Scheler]] as a large influence as he created the idea of [[Sociology of knowledge]] which influenced social construction theory.&lt;ref&gt;Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (2009). Social construction of reality. In S. Littlejohn, &amp; K. Foss (Eds.), Encyclopedia of communication theory. (pp. 8-9). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. {{DOI|10.4135/9781412959384.n344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lock and Strong, other influential thinkers whose work has affected the development of social constructionism are: [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Alfred Schutz]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Paul Ricoeur]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Valentin Volosinov]], [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Harold Garfinkel]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Anthony Giddens]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Ken Gergen]], [[Mary Gergen]], [[Rom Harre]], and [[John Shotter]].&lt;ref&gt;Andy Lock and Tom Strong.2010.

== Applications ==
===Personal construct psychology===
Since its appearance in the 1950s, [[personal construct psychology]] (PCP) has mainly developed as a constructivist theory of personality and a system of transforming individual [[meaning-making]] processes, largely in therapeutic contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Bannister, D., &amp; Mair, M.M. (1968) ''The evaluation of personal constructs''. London, UK: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Kelly (psychologist)|Kelly, G.A.]] (1955), ''The psychology of personal constructs''. New York, NY: Norton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mair, J.M. (1977), ''The community of self''. In D. Bannister (Ed.), ''New perspectives in personal construct theory'' (pp. 125–149). London, UK: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neimeyer, R.A., &amp; Levitt, H. (2000), ''What’s narrative got to do with it? Construction and coherence in accounts of loss''. In J. Harvey (Ed.), Loss and trauma (pp. 401–412). Philadelphia, PA: Brunner Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Procter, H.G. (1981), ''Family construct psychology''. In S. Walrond-Skinner (Ed.), ''Family therapy and approaches'' (pp. 350–367). London, UK: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stojnov, D., &amp; Butt, T. (2002), ''The relational basis of personal construct psychology''. In R. Neimeyer &amp; G. Neimeyer (Eds.), ''Advances of personal construct theory: New directions and perspectives'' (pp. 81–113). Westport, CT: Praeger&lt;/ref&gt; It was based around the notion of persons as scientists who form and test theories about their worlds. Therefore, it represented one of the first attempts to appreciate the constructive nature of experience and the meaning persons give to their experience.&lt;ref&gt;Harré, R., &amp; Gillett, D. (1994). The discursive mind. London, UK: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; Social constructionism (SC), on the other hand, mainly developed as a form of a critique,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shotter | first1 = J. | last2 = Lannamann | first2 = J. | year = 2002 | title = The situation of social constructionism: Its imprisonment within the ritual of theory-criticism-and-debate | url = | journal = [[Theory &amp; Psychology]] | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 577–609 | doi=10.1177/0959354302012005894}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to transform the oppressing effects of the social meaning-making processes. Over the years, it has grown into a cluster of different approaches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harré | first1 = R | year = 2002 | title = Public sources of the personal mind: Social constructionism in context | url = | journal = Theory &amp; Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 611–623 | doi=10.1177/0959354302012005895}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no single SC position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stam | first1 = H.J. | year = 2001 | title = Introduction: Social constructionism and its critiques | url = | journal = Theory &amp; Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 291–296 | doi=10.1177/0959354301113001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, different approaches under the generic term of SC are loosely linked by some shared assumptions about language, knowledge, and reality.&lt;ref&gt;Burr, V. (1995), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LIiJAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An introduction to social constructionism]''. London, UK: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

A usual way of thinking about the relationship between PCP and SC is treating them as two separate entities that are similar in some aspects, but also very different in others. This way of conceptualizing this relationship is a logical result of the circumstantial differences of their emergence. In subsequent analyses these differences between PCP and SC were framed around several points of tension, formulated as binary oppositions: personal/social; individualist/relational; agency/structure; constructivist/constructionist.&lt;ref&gt;Botella, L.

Reframing the relationship between PCP and SC may be of use in both the PCP and the SC communities. On one hand, it extends and enriches SC theory and points to benefits of applying the PCP “toolkit” in constructionist therapy and research. On the other hand, the reframing contributes to PCP theory and points to new ways of addressing social construction in therapeutic conversations.&lt;ref&gt;Pavlović, J. (2011). Personal construct psychology and social constructionism are not incompatible: Implications of a reframing Theory &amp; Psychology 21: 396–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational psychology===
Like social constructionism, [[social constructivism]] states that people work together to construct [[Social artifact|artifacts]]. While social constructionism focuses on the artifacts that are created through the social interactions of a group, social constructivism focuses on an individual's learning that takes place because of his or her interactions in a group.

Social constructivism has been studied by many educational psychologists, who are concerned with its implications for teaching and learning. For more on the psychological dimensions of social constructivism, see the work of [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]] and A. Sullivan Palincsar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = von Glasersfeld | first1 = Ernst | year = 1995 | title = Radical Constructivism: A Way of Knowing and Learning|location= London|publisher= Routledge }}; {{cite journal | last1=Palincsar|first1= A.S. |year=1998|title= Social constructivist perspectives on teaching and learning | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.345 |pmid= 15012472 | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 345–375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systemic therapy===
[[Systemic therapy]] is a form of psychotherapy which seeks to address people as people in relationship, dealing with the interactions of groups and their interactional patterns and dynamics.

===Communication studies===
A bibliographic review of social constructionism as used within [[communication studies]] was published in 2016. It features a good overview of resources from that disciplinary perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (2016). "Social construction". In P. Moy (Ed.), ''Oxford bibliographies in communication''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teleology of social construction ==
The concepts of ''weak'' and '''strong''' as applied to opposing [[philosophical position]]s, "isms", inform a [[teleology]]{{spaced ndash}}the goal-oriented, meaningful or "final end" of an interpretation of reality. "Isms" are not personal opinions, but the extreme, modal, formulations that actual persons, individuals, can then consider, and take a position between. There are opposing philosophical positions concerning the feasibility of co-creating a common, shared, social reality, called ''weak'' and '''strong'''.

[[John R. Searle]] does not elucidate the terms '''strong''' and ''weak'' in his book ''The Construction of Social Reality'',&lt;ref name="cosr"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Construction of Social Reality |last=Searle |first=John |year=1995 |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-684-83179-4 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he clearly uses them in his [[Chinese room]] argument, where he debates the feasibility of creating a computing machine with a sharable understanding of reality, and he adds [[Chinese room#Computers vs. machines vs. brains|"We are precisely such machines."]] '''Strong''' artificial intelligence ([[Artificial general intelligence|Strong AI]]) is the bet that computer programmers will somehow eventually achieve a computing machine with a mind of its own, and that it will eventually be more powerful than a human mind. Weak AI bets they won't.

[[David Deutsch]] in his book ''[[The Fabric of Reality#The Church–Turing thesis|The Fabric of Reality]]'' uses a form of '''strong''' [[Turing principle]] to share [[Frank Tipler]]'s view of the final state of the universe as an omnipotent (but not [[Omniscience|omniscient]]), [[Omega point]], computer. ''But this computer is a society of creative thinkers, or people'' (albeit posthuman transhuman persons), having debates in order to generate information, in the never-ending attempt to attain omniscience of this physics{{mdash}}its evolutionary forms, its computational abilities, and the methods of its epistemology{{mdash}}having an eternity to do so. (p.&amp;nbsp;356)

Because both the Chinese room argument and the construction of social reality deal with Searle and his debates, and because they both use ''weak'' and '''strong''' to denote a philosophical position, and because both debate the programmability of "the other", it is worth noting the correspondence that "strong AI" is '''strong''' social constructionism, and "weak AI" is weak social constructivism.

Strong social constructiv''ism'' says "none are able to ''communicate'' either a full reality or an accurate ontology, therefore my position must impose, by a sort of [[Divine right of kings|divine right]], my observer-relative epistemology", whereas weak social constructiv''ism'' says "none are able to ''know'' a full reality, therefore ''we must'' cooperate, informing and conveying an objective ontology as best we can."&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John R. (New York: Free Press, 1997) The Constructions of Social Reality (p. 365)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weak teleology {{anchor|Weak}}===
''Weak social constructionism'' sees the underlying, objective, "[[brute fact]]" elements of the class of languages and functional assignments of human, metaphysical, reality. Brute facts are all facts that are not institutional facts (e.g., metaphysical, social agreement). The skeptic portrays the ''weak'' aspect of social constructivism, and wants to spend effort debating the institutional realities.

Harvard psychologist [[Steven Pinker]]&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, Steven (Penguin Books, 2002) The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature (p. 202)&lt;/ref&gt; writes that "some categories really are social constructions: they exist only because people tacitly agree to act as if they exist. Examples include money, [[tenure]], [[citizenship]], decorations for bravery, and the presidency of the United States."

In a similar vein, [[Stanley Fish]]&lt;ref&gt;Fish, Stanley (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that baseball's "balls and strikes" are social constructions.&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, Ian (1999) (pp. 29-31)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29–31}}

Both Fish and Pinker agree that the sorts of [[object (philosophy)|object]]s indicated here can be described as part of what [[John Searle]] calls "social reality."&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, Ian (1999)(p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} In particular, they are, in Searle's terms, [[Ontology|ontologically]] [[Subjectivity|subjective]] but [[Epistemology|epistemologically]] [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]].&lt;ref name="cosr" /&gt;{{rp|63}} "Social facts" are temporally, ontologically, and logically dependent on "brute facts." For example, "money" in the form of its raw materials (rag, pulp, ink) as constituted socially for barter (for example by a banking system) is a social fact of "money" by virtue of (i) collectively willing and intending (ii) to impose some particular function (purpose for which), (iii) by constitutive rules atop the "brute facts." "Social facts have the remarkable feature of having no analogue among physical brute facts" (34). The existence of language is itself constitutive of the social fact (37), which natural or brute facts do not require. Natural or "brute" facts exist independently of language; thus a "mountain" is a mountain in every language and in no language; it simply is what it is.&lt;ref name="cosr" /&gt;{{rp|29, et seq}}

Searle illustrates the evolution of social facts from brute facts by the constitutive rule: X counts as Y in C. "The Y terms has to assign a new ''status'' that the object does not already have just in virtue of satisfying the Y term; and there has to be collective agreement, or at least acceptance, both in the imposition of that status on the stuff referred to by the X term and about the function that goes with that status. Furthermore, because the physical features brute facts specified by the X term are insufficient by themselves to guarantee the fulfillment of the assigned function specified by the Y term, the new status and its attendant functions have to be the sort of things that can be constituted by collective agreement or acceptance."&lt;ref name="cosr" /&gt;{{rp|44}}

It is true or false that language is not a "brute fact," that it is an institutional fact, a human convention, a metaphysical reality (that happens to be physically uttered), but Searle points out that there are language-independent thoughts "noninstitutional, primitive, biological inclinations and cognitions not requiring any linguistic devices," and that there are many "brute facts" amongst both humans and animals that are truths that should not be altered in the social constructs because language does not truly constitute them, despite the attempt to institute them for any [[Group think|group's gain]]: money and property are language dependent, but desires (thirst, hunger) and emotions (fear, rage) are not.&lt;ref name="cosr" /&gt;{{rp|62}} ([[Meditations on First Philosophy|Descartes]] describes the difference between imagination as a sort of vision, or image, and intellect as conceptualizing things by symbolic manipulation.) Therefore, there is doubt that society or a computer can be completely programmed by language and images, (because there is a programmable, emotive effect of images that derives from the language of judgment towards images).

Finally, against the strong theory and for the weak theory, Searle insists, "it could not be the case, as some have maintained, that all facts are institutional [i.e., social] facts, that there are no brute facts, because the structure of institutional facts reveals that they are logically dependent on brute facts. To suppose that all facts are institutional [i.e., social] would produce an infinite regress or circularity in the account of institutional facts. In order that some facts are institutional, there must be other facts that are brute [i.e., physical, biological, natural]. This is the consequence of the logical structure of institutional facts.".&lt;ref name="cosr" /&gt;{{rp|56}}

[[Ian Hacking]], [[Canadians|Canadian]] philosopher of science, insists, "the notion that everything is socially constructed has been going the rounds. John Searle [1995] argues vehemently (and in my opinion cogently) against universal constructionism."&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"&gt;Hacking, Ian. ''The Social Construction of What? ''. Harvard University Press, 1999; {{ISBN|0-674-00412-4}}, Numbering begins with 0 for consistency with Hacking's usage.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}} "Universal social constructionism is descended from the doctrine that I once named linguistic idealism and attributed, only half in jest, to Richard Nixon [Hacking, 1975, p. 182]. Linguistic idealism is the doctrine that only what is talked about exists, nothing has reality until it is spoken of, or written about. This extravagant notion is descended from Berkeley's idea-ism, which we call idealism: the doctrine that all that exists is mental."&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"/&gt;{{rp|24}} "They are a part of what John Searle [1995] calls social reality. His book is titled the ''Construction of Social Reality,'' and as I explained elsewhere [Hacking, 1996], that is not a ''social'' construction book at all."&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

Hacking observes, "the label 'social constructionism' is more code than description"&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"/&gt;{{rp|15}} of every Leftist, Marxist, Freudian, and Feminist PostModernist to call into question every moral, sex, gender, power, and deviant claim as just another essentialist claim—including the claim that members of the male and female sex are inherently different, rather than historically and socially constructed. Hacking observes that his 1995 simplistic dismissal of the concept actually revealed to many readers the outrageous implications of the theorists: Is child abuse a real evil, or a social construct, asked Hacking? His dismissive attitude, "gave some readers a way to see that there need be no clash between construction and reality,"&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"/&gt;{{rp|29}} inasmuch as "the metaphor of social construction once had excellent shock value, but now it has become tired."&lt;ref name="Hacking1999"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

Informally, they require human practices to sustain their existence, but they have an effect that is (basically) universally agreed upon. The disagreement lies in whether this category should be called "socially constructed." Ian Hacking&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, Ian. 1997&lt;/ref&gt; argues that it should not. Furthermore, it is not clear that authors who write "social construction" analyses ever mean "social construction" in Pinker's sense. ".&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann, The Social Construction of Reality : A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge" (Anchor, 1967; {{ISBN|0-385-05898-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; If they never do, then Pinker (probably among others) has misunderstood the point of a social constructionist argument.

To understand how weak social constructionism can conclude that metaphysics (a human affair) is not the entire "reality," see the arguments [[Metaphysics#The value and future of metaphysics|against the study of metaphysics]]. This inability to accurately share the ''full'' reality, even given time for a rational conversation, is similarly proclaimed by ''weak artificial intelligence''.

== History and development ==
===Berger and Luckmann===
Constructionism became prominent in the U.S. with [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]]'s 1966 book, ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]''. Berger and Luckmann argue that all knowledge, including the most basic, taken-for-granted [[common sense]] knowledge of everyday reality, is derived from and maintained by [[social interactions]]. When people interact, they do so with the understanding that their respective perceptions of reality are related, and as they act upon this understanding their common knowledge of reality becomes reinforced. Since this common sense knowledge is negotiated by people, human [[typification]]s, [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]ifications and [[social institution|institution]]s come to be presented as part of an objective reality, particularly for future generations who were not involved in the original process of negotiation. For example, as parents negotiate rules for their children to follow, those rules confront the children as externally produced "givens" that they cannot change. Berger and Luckmann's social constructionism has its roots in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. It links to [[Heidegger]] and [[Edmund Husserl]] through the teaching of [[Alfred Schutz]], who was also Berger's PhD adviser.

===Narrative turn===
During the 1970s and 1980s, social constructionist theory underwent a transformation as constructionist sociologists engaged with the work of [[Michel Foucault]] and others as a [[narrative turn]] in the social sciences was worked out in practice. This particularly affected the emergent [[sociology of science]] and the growing field of [[science and technology studies]]. In particular, [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]], [[Bruno Latour]], [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]], [[Steve Woolgar]], and others used social constructionism to relate what science has typically characterized as objective facts to the processes of social construction, with the goal of showing that human [[subjectivity]] imposes itself on those facts we take to be objective, not solely the other way around. A particularly provocative title in this line of thought is [[Andrew Pickering]]'s ''Constructing Quarks: A Sociological History of Particle Physics''. At the same time, Social Constructionism shaped studies of technology – the Sofield, especially on the [[Social construction of technology]], or [[SCOT]], and authors as [[Wiebe Bijker]], [[Trevor Pinch]], [[Maarten van Wesel]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch, T. J. (1996). The Social Construction of Technology: a Review. In R. Fox (Ed.), Technological Change; Methods and Themes in the History of Technology (pp. 17 – 35). Amsterdam: Harwood Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wesel, M. v. (2006). Why we do not always get what we want; The power imbalance in the Social Shaping of Technology (final draft 29 June 2006). Unpublished Master Thesis, Universiteit Maastricht, Maastricht ([https://archive.is/20120914093955/http://www.personeel.unimaas.nl/maarten.wesel/index.htm Look for the latest version here]).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its common perception as objective, mathematics is not immune to social constructionist accounts. Sociologists such as [[Sal Restivo]] and [[Randall Collins]], mathematicians including [[Reuben Hersh]] and [[Philip J. Davis]], and philosophers including [[Paul Ernest]] have published social constructionist treatments of mathematics.

===Postmodernism===
Social constructionism can be seen as a source of the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] movement, and has been influential in the field of [[cultural studies]]. Some have gone so far as to attribute the rise of cultural studies (the [[cultural turn]]) to social constructionism. Within the social constructionist strand of postmodernism, the concept of socially constructed reality stresses the ongoing mass-building of [[worldview]]s by [[individual]]s in [[dialectic]]al interaction with society at a time. The numerous [[reality|realities]] so formed comprise, according to this view, the [[Imagined communities|imagined worlds]] of human social existence and activity, gradually crystallized by [[habituation|habit]] into institutions propped up by [[language]] conventions, given ongoing legitimacy by [[mythology]], religion and philosophy, maintained by therapies and [[socialization]], and subjectively [[internalisation (sociology)|internalized]] by upbringing and education to become part of the [[identity (social science)|identity]] of social citizens.

In the book ''The Reality of Social Construction'', the British sociologist Dave Elder-Vass places the development of social constructionism as one outcome of the legacy of postmodernism. He writes "Perhaps the most widespread and influential product of this process [coming to terms with the legacy of postmodernism] is social constructionism, which has been booming [within the domain of social theory] since the 1980s."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Dave Elder-Vass. 2012.''The Reality of Social Construction''. Cambridge University Press, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Social constructionism falls toward the nurture end of the spectrum of the larger [[nature and nurture]] debate. Consequently, critics have argued that it generally ignores biological influences on behaviour or culture, or suggests that they are unimportant to achieve an understanding of human behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, A., &amp; Bricmont, J. (1999). Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science. NY: Picador.&lt;/ref&gt; The view of most psychologists and social scientists is that behaviour is a complex outcome of both biological and cultural influences.&lt;ref&gt;Francsis, D., &amp; Kaufer, D. (2011). [http://the-scientist.com/2011/10/01/beyond-nature-vs-nurture/ Beyond Nature vs. Nurture]. The Scientist. 1 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridly, M. (2004). The Agile Gene: How Nature Turns on Nurture. NY: Harper.&lt;/ref&gt; Other disciplines, such as [[evolutionary psychology]], [[behaviour genetics]], [[behavioural neuroscience]], [[epigenetics]], etc., take a nature–nurture interactionism approach to understand behaviour or cultural phenomena.

In 1996, to illustrate what he believed to be the intellectual weaknesses of social constructionism and postmodernism, physics professor [[Alan Sokal]] submitted an article to the academic journal ''[[Social Text]]'' deliberately written to be incomprehensible but including phrases and jargon typical of the articles published by the journal. The submission, which was published, was an experiment to see if the journal would "publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html |title=A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies |accessdate=3 April 2007 |last=Sokal |first=Alan D. |authorlink=Alan Sokal |work=''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' |date=May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Postmodernism Generator]] is a computer program that is designed to produce similarly incomprehensible text.&lt;ref&gt;A C Bulhak: On the simulation of postmodernism and mental debility using recursive transition networks, 96/264, Dept Computer Science Technical Reports, Dept Computer Science, Monash Univ, Melbourne Australia, 1–12, 12pp. Technical report CS 96/264&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Sokal, with coauthor Jean Bricmont published the book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'', which criticized [[postmodernism]] and social constructionism.

Philosopher [[Paul Boghossian]] has also written against social constructionism. He follows Ian Hacking's argument that many adopt social constructionism because of its potentially liberating stance: if things are the way that they are only because of our social conventions, as opposed to being so naturally, then it should be possible to change them into how we would rather have them be. He then states that social constructionists argue that we should refrain from making absolute judgements about what is true and instead state that something is true in the light of this or that theory. Countering this, he states:
{{quote|But it is hard to see how we might coherently follow this advice. Given that the propositions which make up epistemic systems are just very general propositions about what absolutely justifies what, it makes no sense to insist that we abandon making absolute ''particular'' judgements about what justifies what while allowing us to ''accept'' absolute ''general'' judgements about what justifies what. But in effect this is what the epistemic relativist is recommending.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Boghossian, ''Fear of Knowledge: Against Relativism and Conmstructivism'', Oxford University Press, 2006, 152pp, hb/pb, {{ISBN|0-19-928718-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later in the same work, Boghossian severely constrains the requirements of relativism. He states that instead of believing that any world view is just as true as any other ([[cultural relativism]]), we should believe that:
{{quote|If we were to encounter an ''actual'', coherent, fundamental, genuine alternative to our epistemic system, C2, whose track record was ''impressive'' enough to make us doubt the correctness of our own system, C1, we would not be able to justify C1 over C2 even by our own lights.}}

Woolgar and Pawluch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woolgar | first1 = S | last2 = Pawluch | first2 = D | year = 1985 | title = Ontological gerrymandering: The anatomy of social problems explanations | url = | journal = Social Problems | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 214–27 | doi=10.1525/sp.1985.32.3.03a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that constructionists tend to 'ontological gerrymander' social conditions in and out of their analysis. Following this point, Thibodeaux&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thibodeaux | first1 = Jarrett | year = 2014 | title = Three Versions of Constructionism and their Reliance on Social Conditions in Social Problems Research | url = | journal = Sociology | volume = 48 | issue = 4| pages = 829–837 | doi=10.1177/0038038513511560}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that constructionism can both separate and combine a subject and their effective environment. To resolve this he argued that objective conditions should be used when analyzing how perspectives are motivated.

Social constructionism has been criticized by psychologists such as University of Toronto Professor [[Jordan Peterson]] and evolutionary psychologists, including [[Steven Pinker]] in his book ''[[The Blank Slate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quarterlyconversation.com/against-steven-pinkers-the-blank-slate|title=Breaking the Code: Against Steven Pinker's The Blank Slate {{!}} Quarterly Conversation|website=quarterlyconversation.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]] used the term "[[standard social science model]]" to refer to social-science philosophies that they argue fail to take into account the evolved properties of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Barkow, J., Cosmides, L. &amp; Tooby, J. 1992. ''The adapted mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4356">In [[statistics]], a '''population''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or [[experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Glossary of statistical terms: Population|website=[[Statistics.com]]|url=http://www.statistics.com/glossary&amp;term_id=812|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A statistical population can be a group of existing objects (e.g. the set of all [[star]]s within the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]]) or a hypothetical and potentially [[Infinite set|infinite]] group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all possible hands in a game of [[poker]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|Population}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Yates | first = Daniel S. | last2 = Moore | first2 = David S | last3 = Starnes | first3 = Daren S. | year = 2003 | title = The Practice of Statistics | edition = 2nd | publisher = [[W. H. Freeman and Company|Freeman]] | location = New York | url = http://bcs.whfreeman.com/yates2e/ | isbn = 978-0-7167-4773-4 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050209001108/http://bcs.whfreeman.com/yates2e/ | archivedate = 2005-02-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[statistical inference]], a [[subset]] of the population (a statistical [[sample (statistics)|sample]]) is chosen to represent the population in a statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Glossary of statistical terms: Sample|website=[[Statistics.com]]|url=http://www.statistics.com/glossary&amp;term_id=281|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of the size of this statistical sample to the size of the population is called a [[sampling fraction]].  If a sample is [[Sampling (statistics)|chosen properly]], characteristics of the entire population that the sample is drawn from can be [[Estimation theory|estimated]] from corresponding characteristics of the sample{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

==Subpopulation==
A subconcept of a population that shares one or more additional properties is called a '''subpopulation'''. For example, if the population is all Egyptian people, a subpopulation is all Egyptian males; if the population is all pharmacies in the world, a subpopulation is all pharmacies in Egypt. By contrast, a sample is a subset of a population that is not chosen to share any additional property.

Descriptive statistics may yield different results for different subpopulations. For instance, a particular medicine may have different effects on different subpopulations, and these effects may be obscured or dismissed if such special subpopulations are not identified and examined in isolation.

Similarly, one can often estimate parameters more accurately if one separates out subpopulations: the distribution of heights among people is better modeled by considering men and women as separate subpopulations, for instance.

Populations consisting of subpopulations can be modeled by [[mixture model]]s, which combine the distributions within subpopulations into an overall population distribution. Even if subpopulations are well-modeled by given simple models, the overall population may be poorly fit by a given simple model – poor fit may be evidence for existence of subpopulations. For example, given two equal subpopulations, both normally distributed, if they have the same standard deviation and different means, the overall distribution will exhibit low [[kurtosis]] relative to a single normal distribution – the means of the subpopulations fall on the shoulders of the overall distribution. If sufficiently separated, these form a [[bimodal distribution]], otherwise it simply has a wide peak. Further, it will exhibit [[overdispersion]] relative to a single normal distribution with the given variation. Alternatively, given two subpopulations with the same mean and different standard deviations, the overall population will exhibit high kurtosis, with a sharper peak and heavier tails (and correspondingly shallower shoulders) than a single distribution

'''''Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics''''' ('''''SICM''''') is a [[classical mechanics]] [[textbook]] written by [[Gerald Jay Sussman]] and [[Jack Wisdom]] with [[Meinhard E. Mayer]]. The first edition was published by [[MIT Press]] in 2001, and a second edition was released in 2015. The book is used at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to teach a class in advanced classical mechanics, starting with [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]] and proceeding through canonical [[perturbation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hut|first=Piet|author-link=Piet Hut|date=2002-02-01|title=Book Review: Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics|url=https://www.ids.ias.edu/~piet/publ/other/sicm.html|journal=[[Foundations of Physics]]|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=323–326|doi=10.1023/a:1014417411545|issn=0015-9018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/|title=Classical Mechanics: A Computational Approach|last=|first=|date=|website=[[CSAIL]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''SICM'' explains some physical phenomena by showing [[computer program]]s for simulating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Brian|author-link=Brian Hayes (scientist)|date=2002|title=Matter in Motion|jstor=27857667|journal=[[American Scientist]]|volume=90|pages=278&amp;ndash;279|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are written in the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme programming language]], as were the programs in Sussman's earlier [[computer science]] textbook, ''[[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs]]''.

Sussman wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Classical mechanics is deceptively simple. It is surprisingly easy to get the right answer with [[fallacy|fallacious]] reasoning or without the real understanding. To address this problem Jack Wisdom and I, with help from Hardy Mayer, have written [''Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics''] and are teaching a class at MIT that uses computational techniques to communicate a deeper understanding of Classical mechanics. We use computational algorithms to express the methods used to analyze dynamical phenomena. Expressing the methods in a computer language forces them to be unambiguous and computationally effective. Formulating a method as a computer-executable program and [[debugging]] that program is a powerful exercise in the learning process. Also, once formalized procedurally, a mathematical idea becomes a tool that can be used directly to compute results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eecs.mit.edu/AY01-02/events/8.html|title=EECS Event: Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics|last=Sussman|first=Gerald Jay|date=2001-09-17|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020615184138/http://www.eecs.mit.edu/AY01-02/events/8.html|archive-date=2002-06-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1237">'''''The New Politics of Science''''' is a 1984 book by David Dickson. The book is about the political relationships which affect [[science]] funding. Dickson argues that decisions about science are becoming concentrated in a closed circle of corporate, banking, and military leaders and that America's scientific enterprise is being steadily removed from public decision-making.&lt;ref name=dave&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19840901fabook11944/david-dickson/the-new-politics-of-science.html  The New Politics of Science.

*Making the [[green economy|Green Economy]] Work for Everybody by Michael Renner&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.worldwatch.org/sustainableprosperity/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SOW12_chap_1.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;
*Nine [[Human population planning|Population Strategies]] to Stop Short of 9 Billion by [[Robert Engelman]]&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.worldwatch.org/sustainableprosperity/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/SOW12_chap_9.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Biodiversity]]: Combating the [[Holocene extinction|Sixth Mass Extinction]] by Bo Normander&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.worldwatch.org/sustainableprosperity/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/SOW12_chap_15.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

In his chapter of the report, Assadourian defines [[degrowth]] as an "essential and urgent" [[economic]] strategy to pursue in countries entrenched in [[overdevelopment]] (such as the [[United States]]) in order for those countries to be truly [[sustainability|sustainable]] and adapt to "The rapidly [[global warming|warming Earth]] and the collapse of [[ecosystem services]]".  Furthermore, he hopes to dispel "the myth that perpetual pursuit of growth is good for economies or the societies of which they are a part" for the well-being of the planet, of [[underdevelopment|underdeveloped]] populations, and of the sick, [[stress (psychological)|stressed]], and [[overweight]] populations of overdeveloped countries.  Assadourian argues via the [[principle of plenitude]] that degrowth will inevitably occur whether we want it to or not because—on a planet of finite [[resource]]s—economies and populations cannot grow infinitely, and overdeveloped countries are still pursuing more [[economic growth]] and [[overconsumption|overconsuming]] resources.

Assadourian outlines four policies overdeveloped nations could employ to sufficiently facilitate a planned and controlled contraction of the economy so as to get back in line with planetary boundaries.  Each of these, in unison, will eventually foster the creation of a [[steady-state economy]] that is in balance with Earth’s limits:

* Reduce overall consumption by overconsumers
* Distribute [[tax burden]]s more equitably
* [[Work sharing|Share work hours]] better
* Cultivate a [[plenitude economy]]: “informalize” certain sectors of the economy

Assadourian also wrote a 2-page policy brief&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/SOW12%20Summary%20(Chapter%202).pdf &lt;/ref&gt; on the chapter highlighting the key messages of, the problem regarding, and points to keep in mind moving forward on our path to degrowth.

'''''The Varieties of Scientific Experience: A Personal View of the Search for God''''' is a book collecting transcribed talks on the subject of [[natural theology]] that astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] delivered in [[1985]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] as part of the [[Gifford Lectures]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/12/20/carl-sagan-varieties-of-scientific-experience The Varieties of Scientific Experience: Carl Sagan on Science and Spirituality, Brain Pickings]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was first published posthumously in 2006, 10 years after his death. The title is a reference to ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' by [[William James]].

The book was edited by [[Ann Druyan]], who also provided an introduction section. The sixth chapter, ''The God Hypothesis'', was later reprinted in Christopher Hitchens' anthology ''The Portable Atheist''.

'''Uncertainty theory''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] based on normality, monotonicity, self-duality, countable subadditivity, and product measure axioms.{{Clarify|date=December 2009}} It was founded by Baoding Liu &lt;ref&gt;Baoding Liu, Uncertainty Theory, 2nd ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 and refined in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Baoding Liu, Uncertainty Theory, 4th ed., http://orsc.edu.cn/liu/ut.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematical measures of the likelihood of an event being true include [[probability theory]], capacity, [[fuzzy logic]], possibility, and credibility, as well as uncertainty.

==Four axioms==
'''Axiom 1.''' (Normality Axiom) &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\{\Gamma\}=1\text{ for the universal set }\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Axiom 2.''' (Self-Duality Axiom) &lt;Math&gt;\mathcal{M}\{\Lambda\}+\mathcal{M}\{\Lambda^c\}=1\text{ for any event }\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Axiom 3.''' (Countable Subadditivity Axiom) For every countable sequence of events &amp;Lambda;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;Lambda;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., we have
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\left\{\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty\Lambda_i\right\}\le\sum_{i=1}^\infty\mathcal{M}\{\Lambda_i\}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Axiom 4.''' (Product Measure Axiom) Let &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma_k,\mathcal{L}_k,\mathcal{M}_k)&lt;/math&gt; be uncertainty spaces for &lt;math&gt;k=1,2,\cdots,n&lt;/math&gt;. Then the product uncertain measure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is an uncertain measure on the product &amp;sigma;-algebra satisfying
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\left\{\prod_{i=1}^n\Lambda_i\right\}=\underset{1\le i\le n}{\operatorname{min} }\mathcal{M}_i\{\Lambda_i\}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Principle.''' (Maximum Uncertainty Principle) For any event, if there are multiple reasonable values that an uncertain measure may take, then the value as close to 0.5 as possible is assigned to the event.

==Uncertain variables==
An uncertain variable is a [[measurable function]] ξ from an uncertainty space &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma,L,M)&lt;/math&gt; to the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[real numbers]], i.e., for any [[Borel set]] '''B''' of [[real numbers]], the set 
&lt;math&gt;\{\xi\in B\}=\{\gamma \in \Gamma|\xi(\gamma)\in B\}&lt;/math&gt; is an event.

==Uncertainty distribution==
Uncertainty distribution is inducted to describe uncertain variables.

'''Definition''':The '''uncertainty distribution''' &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x):R \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; of an uncertain variable ξ is defined by &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)=M\{\xi\leq x\}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem'''(Peng and Iwamura, ''Sufficient and Necessary Condition for Uncertainty Distribution'') A function &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x):R \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is an uncertain distribution if and only if it is an increasing function except &lt;math&gt;\Phi (x) \equiv 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi (x)\equiv 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Independence==
'''Definition''': The uncertain variables &lt;math&gt;\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_m&lt;/math&gt; are said to be independent if 
:&lt;math&gt;M\{\cap_{i=1}^m(\xi \in B_i)\}=\mbox{min}_{1\leq i \leq m}M\{\xi_i \in B_i\} &lt;/math&gt;
for any Borel sets &lt;math&gt;B_1,B_2,\ldots,B_m&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers.

'''Theorem 1''': The uncertain variables &lt;math&gt;\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_m&lt;/math&gt; are independent if 
:&lt;math&gt;M\{\cup_{i=1}^m(\xi \in B_i)\}=\mbox{max}_{1\leq i \leq m}M\{\xi_i \in B_i\} &lt;/math&gt;
for any Borel sets &lt;math&gt;B_1,B_2,\ldots,B_m&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers.

'''Theorem 2''': Let &lt;math&gt;\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_m&lt;/math&gt; be independent uncertain variables, and &lt;math&gt;f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_m&lt;/math&gt; measurable functions. Then &lt;math&gt;f_1(\xi_1),f_2(\xi_2),\ldots,f_m(\xi_m)&lt;/math&gt; are independent uncertain variables.

The '''van der Waals equation''' (or '''van der Waals equation of state'''; named after [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals]]) is based on plausible reasons that real gases do not follow the ideal gas law. The ideal gas law treats gas molecules as point particles that do not interact with each other but only with their containers. In other words, they do not take up any space, and are not attracted or repelled by other gas molecules and 
thus never lose kinetic energy during collisions.&lt;ref name=PhysicalChemistry&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Robert J. | last1 = Silbey | first2 = Robert A. | last2 = Alberty | first3 = Moungi G. | last3 = Bawendi | title = Physical Chemistry | edition = 4th | year = 2004 | publisher = Wiley | isbn = 978-0471215042}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ideal Gas Law states that volume (V) occupied by n moles of any gas has a pressure (P) at temperature (T) in Kelvin. The relationship for these variables,
P V = n R T,
where R is known as the [[gas constant]], is called the ideal gas law or equation of state.

To account for the volume that a real gas molecule takes up, the van der Waals equation replaces ''V'' in the ideal gas law with ''(V-b)'', where ''b'' is the volume per mole that is occupied by the molecules. This leads to:&lt;ref name=PhysicalChemistry /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P(V_m - b)=R T&lt;/math&gt;

The second modification made to the ideal gas law accounts for the fact that gas molecules do in fact attract each other and that real gases are therefore more compressible than ideal gases. Van der Waals provided for intermolecular attraction by adding to the observed pressure ''P'' in the equation of state a term &lt;math&gt;a/V_m^2&lt;/math&gt;, where ''a'' is a constant whose value depends on the gas. The '''van der Waals equation''' is therefore written as:&lt;ref name=PhysicalChemistry /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(P+a/V_m^2)(V_m-b)=R T&lt;/math&gt;
and can also be written as below equation

:&lt;math&gt;(P+a n^2/V^2)(V-n b)=n R T&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[molar volume]] of the gas, ''R'' is the universal gas constant, ''T'' is temperature, ''P'' is pressure, and ''V'' is volume. When the molar volume ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is large, ''b'' becomes negligible in comparison with ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a/V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' becomes negligible with respect to ''P'', and the van der Waals equation reduces to the ideal gas law, ''PV&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;=RT''.&lt;ref name=PhysicalChemistry /&gt;

It is available via its traditional derivation (a mechanical equation of state), or via a derivation based in [[statistical thermodynamics]], the latter of which provides the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] of the system and allows thermodynamic functions to be specified. It successfully approximates the behavior of real fluids above their [[critical temperature]]s and is qualitatively reasonable for their liquid and low-pressure gaseous states at low temperatures. However, near the [[phase transition|transition]]s between gas and liquid, in the range of ''p'', ''V'', and ''T'' where the liquid [[phase (matter)|phase]] and the [[gas]] phase are in equilibrium, the ''van der Waals equation'' fails to accurately model observed experimental behaviour, in particular that ''p'' is a constant function  of ''V'' at given temperatures. As such, the van der Waals model is not useful only for calculations intended to predict real behavior in regions near the critical point. Empirical corrections to address these predictive deficiencies have been inserted into the van der Waals model, e.g., by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in his [[#Maxwell equal area rule|equal area rule]], and related but distinct theoretical models, e.g., based on the [[principle of corresponding states]], have been developed to achieve better fits to real fluid behaviour in equations of more comparable complexity.

The van der Waals equation is a [[thermodynamic]] [[equation of state]] based on the [[theory]] that [[fluid]]s are composed of particles with non-zero volumes, and subject to a (not necessarily pairwise) inter-particle attractive [[force]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} It was based on work in theoretical [[physical chemistry]] performed in the late 19th century by [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals]], who did related work on the attractive [[van der Waals force|force]] that also bears his name.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The equation is known to be based on a traditional set of derivations deriving from van der Waals' and related efforts,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} as well as a set of derivation based in [[statistical thermodynamics]],{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} see below.

Van der Waals' early, primary interests were in the field of [[thermodynamics]], where a first influence was the published work by [[Rudolf Clausius]] on heat, in 1857; other significant influences were the writings by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], and [[Willard Gibbs]].&lt;ref name="vdW1910nobel"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1910/waals-lecture.pdf | title=Nobel Lectures, Physics 1901-1921 | publisher=Elsevier Publishing Company | year=1967 | location=Amsterdam | pages=254–265 | chapter=J.

While his dissertation helps to explain the experimental observation in 1869 by Irish professor of chemistry [[Thomas Andrews (scientist)|Thomas Andrews]] ([[Queen's University Belfast]]) of the existence of a [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] in fluids&lt;ref name=Andrews1869&gt;{{cite journal | author=Andrews, T. | year = 1869 | title = The Bakerian Lecture: On the Gaseous State of Matter | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 159 | pages = 575–590 | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1869.0021 }}{{primary source inline|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, science historian [[Martin J.

oscillations in the [[phase transition]] zone do not fit experimental data.]]

[[Image:Van der Waals Isotherms.PNG|thumb|right|300px|'''van der Waals isotherms and oscillations, temperatures, ''T'', below and above ''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''.'''{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Shown in this ''PV'' diagram are a series of 5 isotherms for temperatures ranging from below (blue) to above (red) ''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' (the critical temperature), where the upward arise and downward dip in the isotherm predicted by the van der Waals equation (the "oscillation," especially evident for the two isotherms for values of ''T &lt; T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'') is evident in the region of the gas-liquid [[phase transition]].]]
The equation relates four state variables: the [[pressure]] of the fluid ''p'', the total volume of the fluid's container ''V'', the [[number of particles]] ''N'', and the [[temperature|absolute temperature]] of the system ''T''.

The [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive]], microscopic form of the equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(p + \frac{a'}{v^2}\right)\left(v-b'\right) = kT&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=vdW1910nobel/&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;v=V/N&lt;/math&gt;

is the volume of the container occupied by each particle (not the [[velocity]] of a particle), and ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. It introduces two new parameters: ''a&amp;apos;'', a measure of the average attraction between particles, and ''b&amp;apos;'', the volume excluded from ''v'' by one particle.

The equation can be also written in extensive, molar form:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(p + \frac{n^2 a}{V^2}\right)\left(V-nb\right) = nRT&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chang |first=Raymond |date=2014 |title=Physical Chemistry for the Chemical Sciences |publisher=University Science Books |page=14 |isbn=978-1-891389-69-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;a = N_A^2a' &lt;/math&gt;

is a measure of the average attraction between particles,

:&lt;math&gt;b = N_A b' &lt;/math&gt;

is the volume excluded by a mole of particles,

:&lt;math&gt;n=N / N_A&lt;/math&gt;

is the number of moles,

:&lt;math&gt;R = N_A k&lt;/math&gt;

is the universal [[gas constant]], ''k'' is Boltzmann's constant, and ''N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[Avogadro's constant]].

A careful distinction must be drawn between the volume ''available to'' a particle and the volume ''of'' a particle.{{according to whom|date=June 2015}} In the intensive equation, ''v'' equals the total space available to each particle, while the parameter ''b&amp;apos;'' is proportional to the proper volume of a single particle - the volume bounded by the [[atomic radius]]. This is subtracted from ''v'' because of the space taken up by one particle.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} In van der Waals' original derivation, given below, ''b&amp;apos;'' is  four times the proper volume of the particle. Observe further that the pressure ''p'' goes to infinity when the container is completely filled with particles so that there is no void space left for the particles to move; this occurs when ''V'' = ''nb''.&lt;ref name=Purdue&gt;{{cite web|title=Deviations from Idal Gas Law Behavior|url=http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/ch4/deviation5.html#analysis|website=Purdue University}}{{self-published inline|date=June 2015}} {{better source|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=June 2015}} {{better source|date=June 2015}}

===Reduced form===
The van der Waals equation can also be expressed in terms of [[reduced properties]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(P_r + \frac{3}{V_r^2}\right)\left(v_r-\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{3}T&lt;/math&gt;

This yields a critical [[compressibility factor]] of 3/8.

The ''van der Waals equation'' is mathematically simple, but it nevertheless predicts the experimentally observed [[phase transition|transition]] between vapor and liquid, and predicts [[Critical point (thermodynamics)#Liquid-vapor critical point|critical behaviour]].&lt;ref name=Hill12&gt;Terrell L. Hill, 2012 [1960], "An Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics" [Dover Books on Physics], Chicago, IL, USA:R.R. Donnelly (Courier/Dover), {{ISBN|0486130908}}, see [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0486130908], accessed 25 June 2015. Note, this Donnelly edition is a reprint of the 1986 Dover edition, which itself reprinted the 1962 corrected version of the original 1960 text [Addison Wesley Series in Chemistry, Francis T. Bonner &amp; George C. Pimentel, Eds.], Reading, MS, USA:Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|289}}

Above the [[critical temperature]], ''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'', the van der Waals equation is an improvement over the [[ideal gas law]], and for lower temperatures, i.e., ''T'' &lt; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;,  the equation is also qualitatively reasonable for the liquid and low-pressure gaseous states; however, with respect to the [[phase transition|first-order phase transition]], i.e., the range of (''p, V, T'') where a liquid [[phase (matter)|phase]] and a [[gas]] phase would be in equilibrium, the equation appears to fail to predict observed experimental behaviour, in the sense that &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt; is typically observed to be constant as a function  of ''V'' for a given temperature in the two-phase region.  This apparent discrepancy is resolved in the context of vapour–liquid equilibrium:  at a particular temperature, there exist two points on the van der Waals isotherm that have the same chemical potential, and thus a system in thermodynamic equilibrium will appear to traverse a straight line on the ''p''–''V'' diagram as the ratio of vapour to liquid changes.  However, in such a system, there are really only two points present (the liquid and the vapour) rather than a series of states connected by a line, so connecting the locus of points is incorrect:  it is not an equation of multiple states, but an equation of (a single) state.  It is indeed possible to compress a gas beyond the point at which it would typically condense, given the right conditions, and it is also possible to expand a liquid beyond the point at which it would usually boil.  Such states are called "metastable" states.  Such behaviour is qualitatively (though perhaps not quantitatively) predicted by the van der Waals equation of state.&lt;ref name=Sandler&gt;S. I. Sandler, "Chemical and Engineering Thermodynamics," Third Edition. New York: Wiley, 1999, page 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the values of physical quantities as predicted with the van der Waals equation of state "are in very poor agreement with experiment," so the model's utility is limited to qualitative rather than quantitative purposes.&lt;ref name=Hill12/&gt;{{rp|289}} Empirically-based corrections can easily be inserted into the van der Waals model (see [[#Maxwell equal area rule|Maxwell's correction]], below), but in so doing, the modified expression is no longer as simple an analytical model; in this regard, other models, such as those based on the [[principle of corresponding states]], achieve a better fit with roughly the same work.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}
Even with its acknowledged shortcomings, the pervasive use of the ''van der Waals equation'' in standard university [[physical chemistry]] textbooks makes clear its importance as a pedagogic tool to aid understanding fundamental physical chemistry ideas involved in developing theories of vapour–liquid behavior and equations of state.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Atkins &amp; Julio de Paula, 2006, "Physical chemistry," 8th Edn., pp. 17-22, 104''f,'' 632-641, New York, NY, USA:Macmillan, {{ISBN|0716787598}}, see [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0716787598], accessed 21 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.

==Derivation==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Textbooks in physical chemistry generally give two [[Formal proof|derivations]] of the title equation.{{who|date=June 2015}} One is the conventional derivation that goes back to van der Waals, a mechanical equation of state that cannot be used to specify all thermodynamic functions; the other is a statistical mechanics derivation that makes explicit the intermolecular potential neglected in the first derivation.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} A particular advantage of the statistical mechanical derivation is that it yields the partition function for the system, and allows all thermodynamic functions to be specified (including the mechanical equation of state).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Conventional derivation===
Consider one mole of gas composed of non-interacting point particles that satisfy the [[ideal gas law]]:(see any standard Physical Chemistry text, op. cit.)

:&lt;math&gt; p = \frac{RT}{V_\mathrm{m}} = \frac{RT}{v}.&lt;/math&gt;

Next, assume that all particles are hard spheres of the same finite radius ''r'' (the [[van der Waals radius]]).  The effect of the finite volume of the particles is to decrease the available void space in which the particles are free to move. We must replace ''V'' by  ''V''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''b'', where ''b'' is called the ''excluded volume'' or "co-volume". The corrected equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt; p = \frac{RT}{V_\mathrm{m}-b}.&lt;/math&gt;

The excluded  volume &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is not just equal to the volume occupied by the solid, finite-sized particles, but actually four times that volume. To see this, we must realize that a particle is surrounded by a sphere of radius 2''r'' (two times the original radius) that is forbidden for the centers of the other particles. If the distance between two particle centers were to be smaller than 2''r'', it would mean that the two particles penetrate each other, which, by definition, hard spheres are unable to do.

The excluded volume for the two particles (of average diameter ''d'' or radius ''r'') is

:&lt;math&gt;b'_2 = 4\pi d^3/3 = 8\times (4\pi r^3/3)&lt;/math&gt;,
which, divided by two (the number of colliding particles), gives the excluded volume per particle:

:&lt;math&gt;b' = b'_2/2 \quad \rightarrow \quad b'=4\times (4\pi r^3/3)&lt;/math&gt;,

So ''b&amp;prime;'' is four times the proper volume of the particle. It was a point of concern to van der Waals that the factor four yields an upper bound; empirical values for ''b&amp;prime;'' are usually lower. Of course, molecules are not infinitely hard, as van der Waals thought, and are often fairly soft.

Next, we introduce a (not necessarily pairwise) attractive force between the particles. van der Waals assumed that, notwithstanding the existence of this force, the density of the fluid is homogeneous; furthermore, he assumed that the range of the attractive force is so small that the great majority of the particles do not feel that the container is of finite size.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Given the homogeneity of the fluid, the bulk of the particles do not experience a net force pulling them to the right or to the left. This is different for the  particles in surface layers directly adjacent to the walls. They feel a net force from the bulk particles pulling them into the container, because this force is not compensated  by particles on the side where the wall is (another assumption here is that there is no interaction between walls and particles, which is not true, as can be seen from the phenomenon of droplet formation; most types of liquid show adhesion). This net force decreases the force exerted onto the wall by the particles in the surface layer. The net force on a surface particle, pulling it into the container, is proportional to the number density

:&lt;math&gt;C=N_\mathrm{A}/V_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt;.

The number of particles in the surface layers is, again by assuming homogeneity, also proportional to the density. In total, the force on the walls is decreased by a factor proportional to the square of the density, and the pressure (force per unit surface) is decreased by  
:&lt;math&gt;a'C^2= a' \left(\frac{N_\mathrm{A}}{V_\mathrm{m}}\right)^2 = \frac{a}{V_\mathrm{m}^2}  &lt;/math&gt;,
so that

:&lt;math&gt; p = \frac{RT}{V_\mathrm{m}-b}-\frac{a}{V_\mathrm{m}^2} \Rightarrow
\left(p + \frac{a}{V_\mathrm{m}^2}\right)(V_\mathrm{m}-b) = RT.
&lt;/math&gt;
Upon writing  ''n'' for the number of moles and ''nV''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = ''V'', the equation obtains the second form given above,
:&lt;math&gt; \left(p + \frac{n^2 a}{V^2}\right)(V-nb) = nRT.
&lt;/math&gt;

It is of some historical interesting to point out that van der Waals, in his Nobel prize lecture, gave credit to [[Laplace]] for the argument that pressure is reduced proportional to the square of the density.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}
&lt;!--WHAT IS THIS AND WHY IS IT HERE?
This causes the average [[Helmholtz energy]] per particle to be reduced by an amount  proportional to the fluid [[density]]. However, the pressure obeys the thermodynamic relation

:&lt;math&gt; p = - \left(\frac{\partial A^*}{\partial v}\right)_T &lt;/math&gt;

where ''A*'' is the [[Helmholtz energy]] per particle. The attraction therefore reduces the pressure by an amount proportional to ''1/v²''. Denoting the constant of proportionality by ''a'', we obtain
:&lt;math&gt; p = \frac{kT}{v-b}-\frac{a}{v^2}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the van der Waals equation.

===Statistical thermodynamics derivation===
The canonical [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] ''Z'' of an ideal gas consisting of ''N = nN''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; identical ('''non-interacting''') particles, is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Terrell L.|title=An Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics|date=1960|publisher=Courier Corporation|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Modern Thermodynamics | first = John | last = Denker | year = 2014 | publisher = CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform | isbn = 978-1502530356 | chapter-url = https://www.av8n.com/physics/thermo/z-particles.html#sec-particle-box | chapter = Chapter 26.9, Derivation: Particle in a Box }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
Z = \frac{z^N}{N!}\quad \hbox{with}\quad z = \frac{V}{\Lambda^3}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermal de Broglie wavelength]],
:&lt;math&gt;
\Lambda = \sqrt{\frac{h^2}{2\pi m k T}}
&lt;/math&gt;
with the usual definitions: ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]], ''m'' the mass of a particle, ''k'' [[Boltzmann's constant]] and ''T'' the absolute temperature. In an ideal gas ''z'' is the partition function of a single particle in a container of volume ''V''. In order to derive the van der Waals equation we assume now that each particle moves independently in an average potential field offered by the other particles. The averaging over the particles is easy because we will assume that the particle density of the van der Waals fluid is homogeneous.
The interaction between a pair of particles, which are hard spheres, is taken to be
:&lt;math&gt;
u(r) =
\begin{cases}
\infty                  &amp;\hbox{when}\quad r &lt; d, \\
-\epsilon \left(\frac{d}{r}\right)^6 &amp; \hbox{when}\quad r \ge d,
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
''r'' is the distance between the centers of the spheres and ''d'' is the distance where the hard spheres touch each other (twice the van der Waals radius). The depth of the van der Waals well is &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

Because the particles are not coupled under the mean field Hamiltonian, the mean field approximation of the total partition function still factorizes,

:&lt;math&gt;Z= z^N/N!&lt;/math&gt;,
but the intermolecular potential necessitates two modifications to ''z''. First, because of the finite size of the particles, not all of ''V'' is available, but only ''V − Nb''', where (just as in the conventional derivation above)

:&lt;math&gt; b' =  2\pi d^3/3 &lt;/math&gt;.
Second, we insert a Boltzmann factor
exp['' - ϕ/2kT''] to take care of the average intermolecular potential. We divide here the potential by two because this interaction energy is shared between two particles. Thus
:&lt;math&gt;
z= \frac{(V-Nb') \, e^{-\phi/(2kT)}}{\Lambda^3}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The total attraction felt by a single particle  is
:&lt;math&gt;
\phi = \int_d^{\infty} u(r) \frac{N}{V} 4\pi r^2 dr ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where we assumed that in a shell of thickness d''r'' there are ''N/V''&amp;nbsp;4''π'' ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''dr'' particles. This is a mean field approximation; the position of the particles is averaged. In reality the density close to the particle is different than far away as can be described by a pair correlation function. Furthermore, it is neglected that the fluid is enclosed 
between walls.  Performing the integral we get
:&lt;math&gt;
\phi = -2 a' \frac{N}{V}\quad\hbox{with}\quad a' = \epsilon \frac{2\pi d^3}{3} =\epsilon b'.
&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, we obtain,
:&lt;math&gt;
\ln Z = N \ln {(V-Nb')} + \frac{N^2 a'}{V kT} - N \ln {(\Lambda^3)} -\ln {N!} 
&lt;/math&gt;
From statistical thermodynamics we know that
:&lt;math&gt; p = kT \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial V}
&lt;/math&gt;,
so that we only have  to differentiate the terms containing V. We get
:&lt;math&gt;
p = \frac{NkT}{V-Nb'} - \frac{N^2 a'}{V^2} \Rightarrow
\left(p + \frac{N^2 a'}{V^2} \right)(V-Nb') = NkT \Rightarrow \left(p + \frac{n^2 a}{V^2} \right)(V-nb) = nRT.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Maxwell equal area rule==

The above isotherm is for a reduced temperature of  ''T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''=0.9. The Maxwell correction is at a vapor pressure of ''p&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''≈0.64700 between the reduced volume of the pure liquid ''V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''≈0.60340 and the pure gas ''V&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''≈2.3488 at the vapor pressure.]]

Below the [[critical temperature]], the van der Waals equation seems to predict qualitatively incorrect relationships. Unlike for ideal gases, the p-V isotherms oscillate with a relative minimum (''d'') and a relative maximum (''e''). Any pressure between ''p&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' appears to have 3 stable volumes, contradicting the experimental observation that two state variables completely determine a one-component system's state.&lt;ref name=Sandler284/&gt; Moreover, the isothermal [[compressibility]] is negative between ''d'' and ''e'' (equivalently &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \left({{\partial P}/{\partial V}}\right)_{T,N} &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;), which cannot describe a system at equilibrium.&lt;ref name=Sandler287&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, Biochemical, and Engineering Thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=287|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To address these problems, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] replaced the isotherm between points ''a'' and ''c'' with a horizontal line positioned so that the areas of the two shaded regions would be equal (replacing the ''a''-''d''-''b''-''e''-''c'' curve with a straight line from ''a'' to ''c'');  this portion of the isotherm corresponds to the liquid-vapor equilibrium. The regions of the isotherm from ''a''&amp;ndash;''d'' and from ''c''&amp;ndash;''e'' are interpreted as metastable states of super-heated liquid and super-cooled vapor, respectively.&lt;ref name="Clerk-Maxwell1875"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clerk-Maxwell|first1=J.|title=On the Dynamical Evidence of the Molecular Constitution of Bodies|journal=Nature|volume=11|issue=279|year=1875|pages=357–359|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/011357a0|bibcode = 1875Natur..11..357C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

where ''p&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the vapor pressure (flat portion of the curve), ''V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the volume of the pure liquid phase at point ''a'' on the diagram, and ''V&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the volume of the pure gas phase at point ''c'' on the diagram.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} A two-phase mixture at ''p&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' will occupy a total volume between ''V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'', as determined by Maxwell's [[lever rule]].

Maxwell justified the rule based on the fact that the area on a ''pV'' diagram corresponds to mechanical work, saying that work done on the system in going from ''c'' to ''b'' should equal work released on going from ''a'' to ''b''. This is because the change in free energy ''A''(''T'',''V'') equals the work done during a reversible process, and, as a [[state variable]], the free energy must be path-independent. In particular, the value of ''A'' at point ''b'' should be the same regardless of whether the path taken is from left or right across the horizontal isobar, or follows the original van der Waals isotherm.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

This derivation is not entirely rigorous, since it requires a reversible path through a region of thermodynamic instability, while ''b'' is unstable.{{clarify|date=June 2015}}{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Nevertheless, modern derivations from [[chemical potential]] reach the same conclusion, and it remains a necessary modification to the van der Waals and to any other analytic [[equation of state]].&lt;ref name=Sandler284/&gt;

=== From chemical potential ===
The Maxwell equal area rule can also be derived from an assumption of equal [[chemical potential]] ''μ'' of coexisting liquid and vapour phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The area method for pure fluids and an analysis of the two-phase region |author1=Elhassan, A. E. |author2=Craven, R.J.B. |author3=de Reuck, K. M. | journal=Fluid Phase Equilibria |volume=130 | year=1997 | issue=130 | pages=167–187 | doi=10.1016/S0378-3812(96)03222-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=June 2015}} On the isotherm shown in the above plot, points ''a'' and ''c'' are the only pair of points which fulfill the equilibrium condition of having equal pressure, temperature and chemical potential. It follows that systems with volumes intermediate between these two points will consist of a mixture of the pure liquid and gas with specific volumes equal to the pure liquid and gas phases at points ''a'' and ''c''.

The van der Waals equation may be solved for ''V&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' as functions of the temperature and the vapor pressure ''p&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Since:{{according to whom|date=June 2015}}
:&lt;math&gt;p=-\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial V}\right)_{T,N}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is the Helmholtz free energy, it follows that the equal area rule can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;p_V=\frac{A(V_L,T,N)-A(V_G,T,N)}{V_G-V_L}&lt;/math&gt;is

Since the gas and liquid volumes are functions of ''p&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''T'' only, this equation is then solved numerically to obtain ''p&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' as a function of temperature (and number of particles ''N''), which may then be used to determine the gas and liquid volumes.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

A pseudo-3D plot of the locus of liquid and vapor volumes versus temperature and pressure is shown
in the accompanying figure. One sees that the two locii meet at the critical point (1,1,1) smoothly. An isotherm of the van der Waals fluid taken at ''T &lt;sub&gt; r&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.90 is also shown where the intersections of the isotherm with the loci illustrate the construct's requirement that the two areas (red and blue, shown) are equal.

===Other thermodynamic parameters===
We reiterate that the extensive volume ''V''&amp;nbsp; is related to the volume per particle ''v=V/N''&amp;nbsp; where ''N = nN''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp; is the number of particles in the system.
The equation of state does not give us all the thermodynamic parameters of the system. We can take the equation for the [[Helmholtz energy]] ''A'' &lt;ref name=rut&gt;Michael Gershenson, Date Unknown, "Lecture 16.

:&lt;math&gt;
A = -kT \ln Q.\,
&lt;/math&gt;
From the equation derived above for ln''Q'', we find
:&lt;math&gt;A(T,V,N)=-NkT\left[1+\ln\left(\frac{(V-Nb')T^{3/2}}{N\Phi}\right)\right]
-\frac{a' N^2}{V}.&lt;/math&gt;

Where Φ is an undetermined constant, which may be taken from the [[Sackur–Tetrode equation]] for an ideal gas to be:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi=T^{3/2}\Lambda^3=\left(\frac{h}{\sqrt{2\pi m k}}\right)^3&lt;/math&gt;

This equation expresses ''A''&amp;nbsp; in terms of its [[Thermodynamic potential|natural variables]] ''V''&amp;nbsp; and ''T''&amp;nbsp;, and therefore gives us all thermodynamic information about the system. The mechanical equation of state was already derived above

:&lt;math&gt;p = -\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial V}\right)_T 
= \frac{NkT}{V-Nb'}-\frac{a' N^2}{V^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The entropy equation of state yields the [[entropy]] (''S''&amp;nbsp;)

:&lt;math&gt;S = -\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial T}\right)_V
=Nk\left[ \ln\left(\frac{(V-Nb')T^{3/2}}{N\Phi}\right)+\frac{5}{2} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

from which we can calculate the [[internal energy]]

:&lt;math&gt;U = A+TS = \frac{3}{2}\,NkT-\frac{a'N^2}{V}.&lt;/math&gt;

Similar equations can be written for the other [[thermodynamic potential]] and the [[chemical potential]], but expressing any potential as a function of pressure ''p''&amp;nbsp; will require the solution of a third-order polynomial, which yields a complicated expression. Therefore, expressing the [[enthalpy]] and the [[Gibbs energy]] as functions of their natural variables will be complicated.
&lt;!-- As I don't agree with U=A+TS and don't have patience to read thoroughly all related formulas, I offer another, more simple derivation of formula for internal energy:
: &lt;math&gt;dU = dQ-dA= TdS-PdV.&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{dU}{dV}\right)_{T=const}=T\frac{dS}{dV}-P=T\frac{dP}{dT}-P=T\frac{R}{\frac{V}{n}-b}-P=P+\frac{an^2}{V^2}-P=\frac{an^2}{V^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{dU}{dT}\right)_{V=const}=\left(T\frac{dS}{dT}\right)_{V=const}=\left(\frac{dQ}{dT}\right)_{V=const}=\nu C_V&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;

===Reduced form===
Although the material constant ''a'' and ''b'' in the usual form of the van der Waals equation differs for every single fluid considered, the equation can be recast into an invariant form applicable to ''all'' fluids.

Defining the following reduced variables (''f&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''f&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the reduced and [[critical variable]] versions of ''f'', respectively),

:&lt;math&gt;p_R=\frac{p}{p_C},\qquad
v_R=\frac{v}{v_C},\quad\hbox{and}\quad
T_R=\frac{T}{T_C}&lt;/math&gt;,
where
:&lt;math&gt;
p_C=\frac{a'}{27b'^2}, \qquad \displaystyle{v_C=3b'},\quad\hbox{and}\quad kT_C=\frac{8a'}{27b'}
&lt;/math&gt;

as shown by Salzman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  |url= http://www.chem.arizona.edu/~salzmanr/480a/480ants/vdwcrit/vdwcrit.html
  |title= Critical Constants of the van der Waals Gas

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{self-published inline|date=June 2015}} {{better source|date=June 2015}}

The first form of the van der Waals equation of state given above can be recast in the following reduced form:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(p_R + \frac{3}{v_R^2}\right)(v_R - 1/3) = (8/3) T_R&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is ''invariant'' for all fluids; that is, the same reduced form equation of state applies, no matter what ''a'' and ''b'' may be for the particular fluid.

This invariance may also be understood in terms of the [[principle of corresponding states]]. If two fluids have the same reduced pressure, reduced volume, and reduced temperature, we say that their states are corresponding. The states of two fluids may be corresponding even if their measured pressure, volume, and temperature are very different. If the two fluids' states are corresponding, they exist in the same regime of the reduced form equation of state. Therefore, they will respond to changes in roughly the same way, even though their measurable physical characteristics may differ significantly.

===Cubic equation===
The van der Waals equation is a cubic equation of state; in the reduced formulation the cubic equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;{v_R^3}-\frac{1}{3}\left({1+\frac{8T_R}{p_R}}\right){v_R^2} +\frac{3}{p_R}v_R- \frac{1}{p_R}= 0&lt;/math&gt;

At the critical temperature, where &lt;math&gt;T_R=p_R=1&lt;/math&gt; we get as expected

:&lt;math&gt;{v_R^3}-3v_R^2 +3v_R- 1=\left(v_R -1\right)^3 = 0 \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad  v_R=1&lt;/math&gt;

For ''T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; 1, there are 3 values for ''v&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''.  
For ''T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 1, there is 1 real value for ''v&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The solution of this equation for the case where there are three separate roots may be found at [[Maxwell construction]]

=== Application to compressible fluids ===
The equation is also usable as a [[PVT (physics)|PVT]] equation for [[compressible fluid]]s (e.g. [[polymers]]). In this case [[specific volume]] changes are small and it can be written in a simplified form:

:&lt;math&gt;(p+A)(V-B)=CT, \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is the [[pressure]], ''V'' is [[specific volume]], ''T'' is the [[temperature]] and ''A, B, C'' are parameters.

'''Walras' law''' is a principle in [[general equilibrium|general equilibrium theory]] asserting that budget constraints imply that the ''values'' of [[excess demand]] (or, conversely, excess market supplies) must sum to zero. That is:
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{j=1}^{k}p_j \cdot D_j - \sum_{j=1}^{k}p_j \cdot S_j =  \sum_{j=1}^{k}p_j \cdot (D_j - S_j) = 0, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt; is the price of good ''j'' and &lt;math&gt;D_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_j&lt;/math&gt; are the demand and supply respectively of good ''j''.

Walras' law is named after the economist [[Léon Walras]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Barron | first1=John M. | year=2006 | title=Understanding macroeconomic theory | last2=Ewing | first2=Bradley T. | last3=Lynch | first3=Gerald J. | publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | isbn=978-0-415-70195-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XOK9K39QJkC&amp;pg=PA1 | page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[University of Lausanne]] who formulated the concept in his ''Elements of Pure Economics'' of 1874.&lt;ref name="invdef"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/walras-law.asp |title=Walras' Law |publisher=[[Investopedia]] |accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the concept was expressed earlier but in a less mathematically rigorous fashion by [[John Stuart Mill]] in his ''[[Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy]]'' (1844),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Ariyasajjakorn | first1=Danupon | year=2007 | title=Trade, foreign direct investment, technological change, and structural change in labor usage | publisher=[[ProQuest]] | isbn=978-0-549-30654-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PuwDG9SqjwMC&amp;pg=PA55 | page=55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walras noted the mathematically equivalent proposition that when considering any particular market, if all other markets in an economy are in equilibrium, then that specific market must also be in equilibrium. The term "Walras' law" was coined by [[Oskar R. Lange|Oskar Lange]]&lt;ref&gt;Lange, O. 1942. Say's law: A restatement and criticism. In Lange, O., F. McIntyre, and T. O. Yntema, eds., ''Studies in Mathematical Economics and Econometrics, in Memory of Henry Schultz'', pages 49–68. University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish it from [[Say's law]]. Some economic theorists&lt;ref&gt;Florenzano, M. 1987. On an extension of the Gale–Nikaido–Debreu lemma. ''Economics Letters'' 25(1):51–53.&lt;/ref&gt; also use the term to refer to the weaker proposition that the total value of excess demand cannot exceed the total values of excess supply.

==Definitions==
*A market for a particular commodity is in '''[[market equilibrium|partial equilibrium]]''' if, at the current prices of all commodities, the quantity of the commodity demanded by potential buyers equals the quantity supplied by potential sellers.  For example, suppose the current market price of cherries is $1 per pound.  If all cherry farmers summed together are willing to sell a total of 500 pounds of cherries per week at $1 per pound, and if all potential customers summed together are willing to buy 500 pounds of cherries in total per week when faced with a price of $1 per pound, then the market for cherries is in equilibrium because neither [[Economic shortage|shortages]] nor surpluses of cherries exist.
*An economy is in '''general equilibrium''' if every market in the economy is in partial equilibrium.  Not only must the market for cherries [[Market clearing|clear]], but so too must all markets for all commodities (apples, automobiles, etc.) and for all resources (labor and economic capital) and for all financial assets, including stocks, bonds, and money.
*'Excess demand' refers to a situation in which a market is not in equilibrium at a specific price because the number of units of an item demanded exceeds the quantity of that item supplied at that specific price. Excess demand yields an economic shortage. A negative excess demand is synonymous with an excess supply, in which case there will be an economic surplus of the good or resource. 'Excess demand' may be used more generally to refer to the algebraic value of quantity demanded minus quantity supplied, whether positive or negative.

==Walras' law==
Walras' law states that the sum of the values of excess demands across all markets must equal zero, whether or not the economy is in a general equilibrium. This implies that if positive excess demand exists in one market, negative excess demand must exist in some other market. Thus, if all markets but one are in equilibrium, then that last market must also be in equilibrium.

This last implication is often applied in formal general equilibrium models. In particular, to characterize general equilibrium in a model with ''m'' agents and ''n'' commodities, a modeler may impose market clearing for ''n'' – 1 commodities and "drop the ''n''-th market-clearing condition." In this case, the modeler should include the budget constraints of all ''m'' agents (with equality).  Imposing the budget constraints for all ''m'' agents ensures that Walras' law holds, rendering the ''n''-th market-clearing condition redundant.

In the former example, suppose that the only commodities in the economy are cherries and apples, and that no other markets exist. This is an [[exchange economy]] with no money, so cherries are traded for apples and vice versa. If excess demand for cherries is zero, then by Walras' law, excess demand for apples is also zero. If there is excess demand for cherries, then there will be a surplus (excess supply, or negative excess demand) for apples; and the market value of the excess demand for cherries will equal the market value of the excess supply of apples.

Walras' law is ensured if every agent's budget constraint holds with equality. An agent's budget constraint is an equation stating that the total market value of the agent's planned expenditures, including saving for future consumption, must be less than or equal to the total market value of the agent's expected revenue, including sales of financial assets such as bonds or money.  When an agent's budget constraint holds with equality, the agent neither plans to acquire goods for free (e.g., by stealing), nor does the agent plan to give away any goods for free. If every agent's budget constraint holds with equality, then the total market value of ''all'' agents' planned outlays for ''all'' commodities (including saving, which represents future purchases) must equal the total market value of all agents' planned sales of all commodities and assets. It follows that the market value of total excess demand in the economy must be zero, which is the statement of Walras' law. Walras' law implies that if there are ''n'' markets and ''n'' – 1 of these are in equilibrium, then the last market must also be in equilibrium, a property which is essential in the proof of the existence of equilibrium.

== Formal statement ==
Consider an [[exchange economy]] with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; agents and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; divisible goods.

For every agent &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; be his initial endowment vector and &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; his [[Marshallian demand function]] (demand as a function of prices and income).

Given a price vector &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, the income of consumer &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;p\cdot E_i&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, his demand is &lt;math&gt;x_i(p, p\cdot E_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[excess demand function]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;z(p) = \sum_{i=1}^n {x_i(p, p\cdot E_i) - E_i}&lt;/math&gt;

Walras' law can be stated succinctly as:
:&lt;math&gt;p\cdot z(p) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

PROOF: By definition of the excess demand:

:&lt;math&gt;p\cdot z(p) = \sum_{i=1}^n {p\cdot x_i(p, p\cdot E_i) - p\cdot E_i}&lt;/math&gt;

The Marshallian demand is a bundle &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that maximizes the agent's utility, given the budget constraint. The budget constraint here is:
:&lt;math&gt;p\cdot x = p\cdot E_i&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, all terms in the sum are 0 so the sum itself is 0.&lt;ref name=Varian&gt;{{Cite Varian Microeconomic Analysis 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|317–318}}

==Implications==

===Labor market===
[[Neoclassical economics|Neoclassical macroeconomic reasoning]] concludes that because of Walras' law, if all markets for goods are in equilibrium, the market for labor must also be in equilibrium. Thus, by neoclassical reasoning, Walras' law contradicts the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] conclusion that negative excess demand and consequently, [[involuntary unemployment]], may exist in the labor market, even when all markets for goods are in equilibrium. The Keynesian rebuttal{{doubtful|date=March 2018}} is that this neoclassical perspective ignores financial markets, which may experience excess demand (such as a "[[liquidity trap]]"){{clarify|date=March 2018}} that permits an excess supply of labor and consequently, temporary involuntary unemployment, even if markets for goods are in equilibrium.{{doubtful|date=March 2018}}{{cn|date=March 2018}}

'''William de Alwis''' (1842–1916) was a [[Ceylon]]ese [[artist]] and [[entomologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pethiyagoda|first=Rohan|date=May 1999|title=The Family de Alwis Seneviratne of Sri Lanka: pioneers in biological illustration|url=http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/1199264/18693502/1339431698397/Pethiyagoda+R.+The+Family+de+Alwis+Seneviratne+of+Sri+lanka-+pioneers+in+biological+illustration.pdf?token=UU1kvbI0dn7T8YMa1t3MsCugpHo%3D.|journal=Journal of South Asian Natural History|volume=4|issue=2|pages=99-109|issn=1022-0828|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his brother George (dates unknown), William made a lasting contribution to the knowledge of the [[lepidoptera]], (butterflies and moths) of [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]].

The brothers' father, [[Haramanis de Alwis Seneviratne]] (1792–1894) was a [[botanical illustrator]] who worked at the [[Botanical Gardens]] in Ceylon at [[Kalutara District|Kalutara]] between 1818–1822 and [[Peradeniya]] from 1822–1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/170416/plus/the-unknown-de-alwises-brush-with-asian-flora-236894.html|title=The unknown de Alwises’ brush with Asian flora|last=|first=|date=April 16, 2017|website=www.sundaytimes.lk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He illustrated over 2,000 plants. William was appointed to succeed him to continue the work as a botanical artist.

[[George Henry Kendrick Thwaites|George Thwaites]], the Director of the [[Royal Botanical Gardens, Peradeniya|Botanical Garden]] at Peradeniya between 1849 and 1879, who was impressed by the de Alwis brothers' botanical drawings, recommended to [[William Henry Gregory|W H Gregory]], the [[Governors of British Ceylon|Governor of Ceylon]], that they should draw from nature the butterflies and moths of Ceylon. Thwaites supervised the drawings, many of which were illustrations of specimens that he had collected himself. The drawings were accurate and later used by a number of authors publishing on the lepidoptera of Ceylon, notably by [[George Morrison Reid Henry]] and [[L G O Woodhouse]]. The De Alwis drawings are in the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London.
