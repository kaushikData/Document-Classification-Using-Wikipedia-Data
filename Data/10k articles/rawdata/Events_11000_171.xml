The '''First World Science Fiction Convention''' ([[Worldcon]]) was held in the Caravan Hall in [[New York City|New York]] from July 2 to July 4, 1939, in conjunction with the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]], which was themed as "The World of Tomorrow". The convention was later named "'''Nycon I'''"&lt;ref name="llnotes"/&gt; by [[Forrest J Ackerman]].&lt;ref name="mim29"/&gt; The event had 200 participants.&lt;ref name="time390710"/&gt;&lt;ref name="llist"/&gt;

==Participants==

The Guest of Honor at the first [[Worldcon]] was [[Frank R. Paul]] and the event was chaired by [[Sam Moskowitz]].&lt;ref name="csm630706"/&gt;  Along with Moskowitz, other organizers were [[James V. Taurasi]] and [[Will Sykora]].  Notable people attending included [[John W. Campbell]], [[Isaac Asimov]], [[L. Sprague de Camp]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Hannes Bok]], [[Milton A. Rothman]], [[John Drury Clark|John D. Clark]], [[Jack Williamson]], and [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]].

In addition to its groundbreaking role as the first of its kind, the convention was noteworthy for the exclusion of a number of politicized [[Futurians]] by convention chair Sam Moskowitz; those excluded were  [[Donald A. Wollheim]], [[Frederick Pohl]], John Michel, [[Robert A. W. Lowndes]], and [[Jack Gillespie]], an event known to [[science fiction fandom|fannish historians]] as "The Great Exclusion Act."&lt;ref name="mim6"/&gt;

According to Pohl, in his autobiography ''[[The Way the Future Was]]'', the Futurians held their own counter-convention which was attended by several who went to the regular convention. He also downplayed the aspect that politics played, himself believing that it was a personality conflict between the convention organizers and the Futurians and said "We pretty nearly had it coming," continuing with "What we Futurians made very clear to the rest of New York fandom was that we thought we were better than they were. For some reason that annoyed them."&lt;ref&gt;Frederik Pohl, ''The Way The Future Was'', Ballantine/Del Rey Books, 1978, p.94&lt;/ref&gt;

Ackerman and his girlfriend and fellow [[science fiction fanzines|fanzine]] editor Myrtle R. Douglas ("Morojo") attended the convention in costumes designed and sewn by Douglas: this is considered a forerunner to modern [[cosplay|fan costuming]] (which is known as "cosplay").&lt;ref name="mim29"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yah140724"&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam K. |last=Raymond |publisher=[[Yahoo!

According to Amnesty International, authorities failed to evacuate the impoverished residents and provide them with temporary or alternative housing.

The '''2015–17 FIBA–Euroleague Basketball controversy''' was a dispute between [[FIBA]] and [[Euroleague Basketball]] over control of the premier Europe-wide professional [[sports club|club]] [[basketball]] competition.

==Background==
{{main|FIBA European Champions Cup and EuroLeague history}}
The [[EuroLeague]] was originally established by [[FIBA Europe]], and it operated under its umbrella from 1958 until summer 2000, concluding with the [[1999–2000 FIBA EuroLeague|1999–00 season]]. That was when the richest and most popular European basketball clubs created [[Euroleague Basketball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportcal.com/News/FeaturedNews/104412?sportID=58|title=Munich court lifts injunction blocking FIBA sanctions, but Euroleague pledges to remain vigilant - Featured News- News - Sportcal|author=|date=|website=www.Sportcal.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIBA had never trademarked the "EuroLeague" name, even though it had used that name for the competition since 1996. Euroleague Basketball simply appropriated the name, and since FIBA had no [[legal recourse]] to do anything about it, it was forced to find a new name for its championship series.&lt;ref name="The unknown war"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/featured/322922/the-unknown-war|title=The unknown war - Eurohoops|author=|date=7 October 2016|website=Eurohoops.net|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the following 2000–2001 season had two separate European club competitions: the [[FIBA SuproLeague]] and the new [[Euroleague 2000–01|Euroleague 2000–01 season]].&lt;ref name="The unknown war"/&gt;

Top clubs were also split between the two leagues: [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], [[Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]], [[PBC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]], and [[Anadolu Efes S.K.|Efes Pilsen]] stayed with FIBA, while [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]], [[Virtus Pallacanestro Bologna|Kinder Bologna]], [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]], [[FC Barcelona Bàsquet|FC Barcelona]], [[Saski Baskonia|Baskonia]], and [[Pallacanestro Treviso|Benetton Treviso]] joined Euroleague Basketball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/archive-news-detail.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=european-basketball-split-into-two-2000-07-14|title=Hürriyet Daily News - Archive news detail|author=|date=14 July 2000|website=Hürriyet Daily News - LEADING NEWS SOURCE FOR TURKEY AND THE REGION|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2001, Europe had two first-tier continental champions, Maccabi of the FIBA SuproLeague, and Kinder Bologna of the Euroleague. The leaders of both organizations realized the need to come up with a unified competition.  Although only a year old, Euroleague Basketball negotiated from a position of strength, and dictated proceedings. FIBA essentially had no choice but to agree to Euroleague Basketball's terms. As a result, European club basketball competition was fully integrated under Euroleague Basketball's umbrella, and some teams that competed in the FIBA SuproLeague during the 2000–01 season joined it as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ballineurope.com/we-really-dont-need-another-civil-war/|title=We really don't need another civil war - BallinEurope|author=|date=18 March 2015|website=BallinEurope.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2004, FIBA and EuroLeague officially came to an agreement. In essence, authority in European professional basketball competitions was divided along club-country lines. FIBA remained in charge of national team competitions (like the [[FIBA EuroBasket]], the [[FIBA World Cup|World Championships]], and the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]]), while Euroleague Basketball took over the European professional club competitions. From that point on, FIBA's [[Korać Cup]] and [[Saporta Cup]] competitions, which had recently folded, were replaced by Euroleague Basketball's recently-launched ULEB Cup, later renamed the [[EuroCup Basketball|EuroCup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fibaeurope.com/cid_W75uhWDHGZoQ13nPGyAbv1.coid_UTUQprseGSUi0MX10W8A60.articleMode_on.html|title=FIBA Europe and ULEB Sign Historic Agreement In Geneva - FIBA Europe|author=|date=|website=www.FIBAEurope.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In June 2015, [[FIBA]] announced it would start a new league to compete with [[Euroleague Basketball]]'s second-tier [[EuroCup Basketball|EuroCup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fibaeurope.com/season_2015.coid_CZeceN8pG,2b-CaAGL1dh0.articleMode_on.html|title=FIBA Europe Board pushes ahead with attractive club competitions model|date=30 June 2015|publisher=FIBA Europe|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, FIBA also tried to take the helm of the [[EuroLeague]], by trying to convince eight of the eleven teams with a EuroLeague A-Licence to play in a new FIBA competition instead of the EuroLeague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkbasket.net/16281-fiba-ready-to-shake-up-the-european-club-competition.html|publisher=TalkBasket|title=FIBA ready to shake up the European club competition|date=8 July 2015|access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was unanimously rejected by the EuroLeague clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroleaguebasketball.net/euroleague-basketball/news/i/66rba6ti6umdklcy/euroleague-commercial-assets-and-a-licence-clubs-issue-joint-communication-to-fiba|title=Euroleague Commercial Assets and A-Licence clubs issue joint communication to FIBA|publisher=Euroleague|date=8 July 2015|access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, FIBA attempted to take back control of Europe's first-tier club competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.com/pr65-fiba-to-welcome-top-european-clubs-for-talks-on-new-competition|title=FIBA to welcome top European clubs for talks on new competition|publisher=FIBA|date=27 October 2015|access-date=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.com/pr-68-fiba-offers-innovative-partnership-to-top-european-clubs|title=FIBA offers innovative partnership to top European clubs|publisher=FIBA|date=3 November 2015|access-date=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposing the [[Basketball Champions League]], a new league that would have 16 teams, playing in a round-robin format, and granting eight guaranteed spots to different clubs.

In November 2015, Euroleague Basketball agreed to a 10-year marketing [[joint venture]] with [[IMG (company)|IMG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroleaguebasketball.net/euroleague-basketball/news/i/6gt4utknkf9h8ryq|title=Euroleague Basketball A-licence clubs and IMG agree on 10-year joint venture|publisher=Euroleague Basketball|date=10 November 2015|access-date=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its press release, the EuroLeague announced a new competition format for the [[2016–17 EuroLeague|2016–17 season]], with only 16 teams, including the eleven A-license clubs ([[Anadolu Efes S.K.|Anadolu Efes]], [[Saski Baskonia|Baskonia]], [[PBC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]], [[FC Barcelona Bàsquet|FC Barcelona]], [[Fenerbahçe Men's Basketball|Fenerbahçe]], [[Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]], [[Pallacanestro Olimpia Milano|Olimpia Milano]], [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]], [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]], and [[BC Žalgiris|Žalgiris]]), playing in only one group, with a double round-robin, a true league format, with the top eight placed teams from the regular season then playing in a best-of-five playoffs round to decide qualification to the [[2017 EuroLeague Final Four]].

After its initial proposal was rejected by the EuroLeague clubs, FIBA changed the format of the Basketball Champions League, with qualification based on performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://basketballcl.com/16-17/news/basketball-champions-league-working-groups-make-significant-headway |title=Basketball Champions League Working Groups make significant headway |publisher=BasketballCL.com |date=28 January 2016 |access-date=21 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321191031/http://basketballcl.com/16-17/news/basketball-champions-league-working-groups-make-significant-headway |archivedate=21 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This competition was officially launched on 22 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketballcl.com/pr-73-fiba-confirms-launch-of-basketball-champions-league-for-2016-17-season|title=FIBA confirms launch of Basketball Champions League for 2016-17 season|publisher=BasketballCL.com|date=26 November 2015|access-date=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Threats of suspension of 14 national teams===
Despite the offer of FIBA to all European national basketball federations, many clubs instead agreed with EuroLeague to participate in the [[2016–17 EuroLeague]], or [[2016–17 EuroCup Basketball|2016–17 EuroCup]]. Regional leagues like the [[ABA League|Adriatic League]] and [[VTB United League]], as well as many national domestic leagues, signed contracts with Euroleague Basketball for the right to participate in its competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroleaguebasketball.net/euroleague-basketball/news/i/6t74py47vpaqpt68|title=Euroleague and Eurocup competition structures set for 2016-17|publisher=Euroleague Basketball|date=11 April 2016|access-date=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this support for EuroLeague, FIBA threatened to suspend 14 European basketball federations from [[EuroBasket 2017]]. Notified national organisations were given a five-day period, until 20 April 2016, to explain their stance on the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportando.com/en/national-teams/national-teams/197147/fiba-europe-reportedly-suspended-14-national-federations-from-eurobasket-2017.html|title=FIBA reportedly suspended 14 national federations from Eurobasket 2017|publisher=Sportando|date=15 April 2016|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/sport/kosarka/vesti.php?yyyy=2016&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=16&amp;nav_id=1120583|title=FIBA threatens suspension of 14 national federations from Eurobasket 2017|publisher=B92|date=15 April 2016|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=yugobasket|author=Yugobasket|number=721081044942917634|date=15 April 2016|title=Full letter regarding the suspension of Slovenian Basketball Federation by FIBA:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 April 2016, FIBA asked Germany to take over the hosting of the [[2016 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament – Turin|2016 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament]] from Italy, which was at risk of suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportando.com/en/national-teams/national-teams/197172/fiba-asks-to-germany-the-possibility-to-organize-olympic-qualifying-tournament.html|title=FIBA asks to Germany the possibility to organize Olympic Qualifying Tournament|publisher=Sportando|date=16 April 2016|access-date=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, no suspensions were applied.

====Reactions to the possible suspension====

=====Greece=====
Giorgios Nikolau, director of communications of [[AEK Athens B.C.|AEK Athens]], after its defeat against [[P.A.O.K. B.C.|PAOK]], in the first game of the [[2016 Greek Basket League Playoffs|Greek League quarterfinals]], stated that his club, "will not be blackmailed by anyone, and doesn’t get any kind of messages by anyone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/featured/226562/aek-will-not-be-blackmailed|title=AEK will not be blackmailed|publisher=Eurohoops|date=16 April 2016|access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; AEK had previously agreed to a three-year contract with EuroLeague Basketball to participate in [[EuroCup Basketball]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=====Lithuania=====
On 20 April 2016, the [[Lithuanian Basketball Federation]] suspended [[BC Lietuvos rytas]] for their agreement with EuroLeague. Subsequently, the club from [[Vilnius]] would be disqualified from the [[Lithuanian Basketball League]] (LKL).&lt;ref name="Lietuvos Rytas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/fiba/228990/lithuanian-federation-to-suspend-lietuvos-rytas|title=Lithuanian Federation to suspend Lietuvos Rytas|publisher=Eurohoops|date=20 April 2016|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remigijus Milašius, president of the LKL, refuted their arguments and said that, FIBA "promised a lot of money, which they do not even have".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketnews.lt/news-97243-lkl-prezidentas-milasius-lyga-niekada-nepaliks-zalgirio-ir-lietuvos-ryto.html#.Vx96cjCLTDe|title=BasketNews.lt|language=Lithuanian|date=21 April 2016|access-date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Šarūnas Jasikevičius]], [[head coach]] of Lithuanian team [[BC Žalgiris]], argued that "playing in a FIBA tournament means taking a 20-year step back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/backstage/229218/playing-in-a-fiba-tournament-means-taking-a-20-year-step-back|title=Playing in a FIBA tournament means taking a 20-year step back|publisher=Eurohoops|date=20 April 2016|access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Russia=====
[[Andrei Kirilenko]], president of the [[Russian Basketball Federation]], requested the [[VTB United League]] to suspend the participation of all Russian teams in EuroCup. He also said the contract with VTB would be voided if the league refuses.&lt;ref name="Lietuvos Rytas" /&gt;

=====Spain=====
Francisco Roca, president of the [[Asociación de Clubs de Baloncesto|Spanish ACB]], said, "the ban is unfair and unfounded", and said that there is not any ban for Spanish teams from playing in FIBA competitions, despite agreeing to the contract with [[Euroleague Basketball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/euroleague/226706/roca-the-ban-is-unfair-and-unfounded|title=Roca: "The ban is unfair and unfounded"|publisher=Eurohoops|date=17 April 2016|access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish Basketball Federation]] (FEB) requested that the ACB suspend its agreement with the EuroLeague. The ACB answered again to the FEB, stating that it cannot impede Spanish clubs from joining their tournaments, and that the possible suspension of the [[Spanish national basketball team|Spanish national team]] was not its fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/baloncesto/basketfeb/2016/04/23/571aa447e5fdeaac628b4627.html|title=La ACB responde a la carta de la FEB|publisher=Marca|language=Spanish|date=23 April 2016|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 2016, the [[Consejo Superior de Deportes|Supreme Council for Sports]] of Spain unilaterally cancelled the agreement between the ACB and EuroLeague, with the aim to avoid the suspension to the [[Spain national basketball team|men's national team]].&lt;ref name="CSD anula"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundodeportivo.com/baloncesto/euroliga/20160513/401773619557/el-csd-anula-el-acuerdo-entre-la-acb-y-la-euroliga.html|publisher=Mundo Deportivo|language=Spanish|date=13 May 2016|title=Vía libre a la Selección: el CSD anula el acuerdo entre la ACB y la Euroliga|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clubs Association (ACB) regretted the action of the Council, arguing that it restricts the clubs' freedom to choose the competition that they want to play in. Also, it reminded that FIBA did not explain the reasons for the possible suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acb.com/redaccion.php?id=122628|language=Spanish|date=13 May 2016|access-date=13 May 2016|title=Comunicado Oficial de la ACB|publisher=ACB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Slovenia=====
The [[Slovenian Basketball Federation]], despite the possible suspension of [[Slovenian national basketball team|its national team]], supports FIBA in "its efforts to take action against ECA’s allegedly anti-competitive and illegal practices", but does not understand the suspension, as the Federation does not have any rights in the [[Adriatic League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportando.com/en/national-teams/national-teams/197520/slovenia-basketball-federation-replies-to-fiba-europe-calling-suspension-unfair-unfounded.html|title=Slovenia Basketball Federation replies to FIBA Europe calling suspension unfair, unfounded|publisher=Sportando|date=20 April 2016|access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspension of the recognition of the ABA League===
On 13 April 2016, The [[ABA League]], comprising teams from the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]], agreed with EuroLeague on a four-year contract, for one EuroLeague and three EuroCup spots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanjug.rs/full-view_en.aspx?izb=240934|title=ABA League gets one Euroleague, three Eurocup spots|publisher=Tanjug|date=13 April 2016|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this agreement, FIBA threatened to suspend the six national federations with teams in the ABA League, and on 30 April 2016, it suspended its recognition of the ABA League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fibaeurope.com/coid_,xM3YrFJIck-c700Wd,Mn2.articleMode_on.html|title=FIBA Europe Executive Committee evaluates national federations' response and decides further steps|publisher=FIBA Europe|date=1 May 2016|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This official recognition was in place since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkbasket.net/4064-adriatic-league-officially-recognised-by-fiba-europe.html|publisher=TalkBasket|title=Adriatic League officially recognised by FIBA Europe!|date=18 November 2009|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krešimir Novosel, director of the ABA League, said that he was unsure about FIBA's reasons for suspending recognition of the league, after the ABA had reformed its league to follow the criteria of the International Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkbasket.net/20272-adriatic-league-director-kresimir-novosel-isnt-sure-what-fibas-problem-is.html|title=Adriatic League director Kresimir Novosel isn’t sure what FIBA’s problem is?|publisher=TalkBasket|date=1 May 2016|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration proposals===
On 3 May 2016, EuroLeague presented a collaboration proposal to FIBA, with the integration of the International Federation into the EuroLeague governance, and the possibility of accepting the new playing windows schedule for the [[FIBA World Cup]] qualifying games as main points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroleaguebasketball.net/euroleague-basketball/news/i/6uvqb49fnxpsmsbr|title=Euroleague Basketball presents collaboration proposal to FIBA|date=3 May 2016|access-date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, FIBA sent a letter to EuroLeague, requesting that they agree that FIBA's newly formed competition (the [[Basketball Champions League|Champions League]]) become the new European-wide second-tier competition, instead of the [[EuroCup Basketball|EuroCup]], that they agree to the new FIBA [[national team]] calendar and make the necessary adjustments to its new playing windows schedule, and that they would agree on the future expansion of the EuroLeague to 24 teams in upcoming seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportando.com/en/national-teams/national-teams/198834/fiba-still-open-to-dialogue-here-s-what-they-asked-to-euroleague.html|title=FIBA still open to dialogue, here's what they asked to Euroleague|date=5 May 2016|access-date=6 May 2016|publisher=Sportando}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Threats of suspension of teams===

====Israel====
On 28 June 2016, the [[Israel Basketball Association]] (IBA) informed that [[Hapoel Jerusalem B.C.|Hapoel Jerusalem]], which signed a contract to participate in the EuroCup, would not be allowed to register and play in the [[Israeli Basketball Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport5.co.il/articles.aspx?FolderID=274&amp;docID=218171&amp;lang=HE|title=האיגוד הודיע לירושלים: לא תוכלו להירשם העונה לליגה|trans-title=|language=|author=|date=|website=Sport5.co.il - אתר ערוץ הספורט|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]], one of the teams with an A-license to play in the EuroLeague, announced that, in that case, they would also refuse to register to the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport5.co.il/articles.aspx?FolderID=274&amp;docID=218151&amp;lang=HE|date=28 June 2016|access-date=29 June 2016|language=Hebrew|publisher=Sport5|title=מכבי הודיעה: אם הפועל ירושלים בחוץ, גם אנחנו|trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the IBA did not apply any sanction.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

====Italy====
On 22 April 2016, the three Italian teams that signed a contract with EuroLeague ([[Pallacanestro Reggiana|Reggio Emilia]], [[Dinamo Basket Sassari|Dinamo Sassari]] and [[Aquila Basket Trento]]) announced they would withdraw from the EuroCup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportando.com/en/cups/eurocup/197706/reggio-emilia-trento-and-sassari-to-withdraw-from-eurocup.html|title=Reggio Emilia, Trento and Sassari to withdraw from Eurocup?|publisher=Sportando|date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several threats from [[FIBA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/featured/270950/fiba-asking-from-national-federations-to-saction-eurocup-teams|title=FIBA asking from national federations to saction Eurocup teams|publisher=Eurohoops.net|date=30 June 2016|access-date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/featured/277134/italian-teams-withdraw-from-eurocup|title=Italian teams withdraw from Eurocup!|publisher=Eurohoops.net|date=8 July 2016|access-date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; they withdrew from the competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroleaguebasketball.net/euroleague-basketball/news/i/75agarfis3mk4kro|title=Clubs from FYROM, Lithuania, Russia, Spain to replace Italian clubs in 2016-17 7DAYS EuroCup|publisher=Euroleague Basketball|date=21 July 2016|access-date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead joined the FIBA competition, the Basketball Champions League.

====Russia====
On 27 June 2016, just after participants of the 2016–17 EuroLeague and EuroCup Basketball were revealed, [[Andrei Kirilenko]], president of the [[Russian Basketball Federation]], announced that the four Russian participants in EuroCup ([[BC Khimki|Khimki]], [[PBC Lokomotiv Kuban|Lokomotiv Kuban]], [[BC Nizhny Novgorod|Nizhny Novgorod]], and [[BC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit Saint Petersburg]]) would be disqualified from national domestic competitions (like the [[Russian Basketball Cup|Russian Cup]]), and that their players would be banned from playing with the [[Russia national basketball team|Russian national team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportando.com/en/europe/russia/203831/andrei-kirilenko-nizhny-khimki-lokomotiv-and-zenit-will-be-all-disqualified-.html|title=Andrei Kirilenko: 'Nizhny, Khimki, Lokomotiv and Zenit will be all disqualified'|publisher=Sportando|date=27 June 2016|access-date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not affect participation in the [[VTB United League]], which is not organised by the Russian Federation.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

====Spain====
On 2 August 2016, [[Jorge Garbajosa]], recently elected as president of the [[Spanish Basketball Federation]], sent a letter to the six Spanish clubs that were registered in the EuroCup ([[Bilbao Basket|Bilbao]], [[Baloncesto Fuenlabrada|Fuenlabrada]], [[CB Gran Canaria|Gran Canaria]], [[Baloncesto Málaga|Málaga]], [[CB Murcia|Murcia]], and [[Valencia BC|Valencia]]), accusing them of violating the rules of Spain's [[Consejo Superior de Deportes|Supreme Council of Sports]]. This organisation of the [[Spanish government]] had previously cancelled the ACB-EuroLeague agreement.&lt;ref name="CSD anula" /&gt;

====Greece====
The [[Hellenic Basketball Federation]] initially threatened to ban [[AEK Athens BC|AEK Athens]] from the [[Greek Basket League]], if it did not switch from the EuroCup to FIBA's Basketball Champions League. The Hellenic Basketball Federation stated that they were sent a letter by FIBA, that demanded that they make such threats. After AEK initially refused to switch to the Champions League, the Hellenic Basketball Federation then refused to grant any Greek League player licenses (meaning they could not play in the Greek League) for all of AEK's new summer signings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/heba/288983/fiba-banned-aeks-new-players-from-getting-a-greek-license|title=FIBA banned AEK's new players from getting a Greek license - Eurohoops|author=|date=28 July 2016|website=Eurohoops.net|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; if they remained in the EuroCup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/eurocup/298789/hapoel-jerusalem-stays-in-eurocup|title=Hapoel Jerusalem stays in Eurocup - Eurohoops|author=|date=14 August 2016|website=Eurohoops.net|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, AEK had no other choice but to withdraw from the EuroCup and switch to the Champions League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/featured/296233/aek-leaves-eurocup-blames-both-euroleague-and-fiba|title=AEK leaves Eurocup, blames both Euroleague and FIBA - Eurohoops|author=|date=10 August 2016|website=Eurohoops.net|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion of the Basketball Champions League===
On 19 August 2016, FIBA announced the expansion of its Basketball Champions League to 40 teams in the regular season, after allowing [[AEK Athens B.C.|AEK Athens]], [[KK Partizan|Partizan]] and [[Basket Zielona Góra|Stelmet Zielona Góra]] to play in it. The three teams previously withdrew from the EuroCup, weeks after this competition had already established the groups and the calendar schedule of the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketballcl.com/16-17/news/aek-partizan-and-zielona-gora-join-basketball-champions-league-as-competition-expands|title=AEK, Partizan and Zielona Gora join Basketball Champions League as competition expands|access-date=19 August 2016|date=19 August 2016|publisher=BasketballCL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As consequence of this, the EuroCup reduced its competition to 20 teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gigantes.com/eurocup-de-20-equipos-el-fuenla-al-grupo-b-con-el-bilbao-y-el-skopje-al-a-con-el-granca/|title=Eurocup de 20 equipos: el Fuenla, al grupo B con el Bilbao, y el Skopje, al A con el Granca|trans-title=|publisher=GigantesBasket.com|date=19 September 2016|access-date=20 September 2016|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to threats of suspension of national teams===
In November 2016, [[FIBA]] sent new letters to the national federations from [[Basketball Federation of Slovenia|Slovenia]], [[Basketball Federation of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Basketball Federation of Macedonia|Macedonia]] asking them to take measures against clubs which compete in the [[EuroCup Basketball|EuroCup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/en/fiba/344079|title=FIBA sent warnings to national federation again|publisher=Eurohoops.net|date=12 November 2016|access-date=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, The Montenegrin Federation suspended [[KK Budućnost|Budućnost VOLI]] from all domestic competitions due to their participation in EuroCup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/en/featured/353236|title=Buducnost temporary suspended from the Montenegrin Basketball Federation|publisher=Eurohoops.net|date=26 November 2016|access-date=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/en/featured/348062|title="FIBA demonstrates the argument of power instead of the power of argument"|publisher=Eurohoops.net|date=18 November 2016|access-date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promotion from Basketball Champions League to EuroLeague===
In November 2016, [[FIBA]] returned to talk with [[Euroleague Basketball]] to express their wish to want a EuroLeague spot to the Champions League winner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/en/featured/350904|title=FIBA wants a Euroleague spot for the Champions League winner|publisher=Eurohoops.net|date=23 November 2016|access-date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Euroleague Basketball CEO replied to FIBA’s proposal, because he understands that this would mean the jump from the European third division to the European first division in an attempt to finish with the EuroCup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/en/featured/355419|title=Italian clubs ready for Eurocup, Bertomeu throws the gauntlet|publisher=Eurohoops.net|date=30 November 2016|access-date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportando.com/en/cups/eurocup/218869/bertomeu-the-champions-league-winners-in-euroleague-impossible-and-it-doesn-t-make-any-sense.html|title=Bertomeu: The Champions League winners in EuroLeague? Impossible and it doesn't make any sense|publisher=Sportando|date=30 November 2016|access-date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return of Italian, French and Turkish clubs to EuroCup===
In January 2017, the Italian clubs wanted to return EuroCup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/en/featured/383149|title=Italians return to Eurocup|publisher=Eurohoops.net|date=15 January 2017|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportando.com/en/cups/eurocup/223119/italy-will-have-one-spot-in-euroleague-and-two-in-eurocup-next-season.html|title=Italy will have one spot in EuroLeague and two in EuroCup next season|publisher=Sportando|date=15 January 2017|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, the French clubs also wanted to return EuroCup, despite the wishes of the French basketball federation that is one of the most faithful supporters of Basketball Champions League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/en/eurocup/404128|title=The French clubs return to EuroCup and the 18-club EuroLeague|publisher=Eurohoops.net|date=19 February 2017|access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, the [[Italian Basketball Federation|Italian Federation]] said that it will give freedom to join any European competition from 2017–18 based on sports merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportando.com/en/cups/eurocup/227869/italian-teams-to-compete-in-eurocup-again-from-next-season.html#refresh_ce|title=Italian teams to compete in EuroCup again from next season|publisher=Sportando|date=4 March 2017|access-date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, the [[Turkish Basketball Federation]] made the same statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketeurope.com/livenews-fr/392143/__trashed-5/|title=Les clubs turcs pourront faire leur retour en Eurocup la saison prochaine|language=fr|date=13 March 2017|publisher=Basket Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and French club [[ASVEL Basket]], chaired by NBA player [[Tony Parker]], confirmed it will join EuroCup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketeurope.com/livenews-fr/392166/lasvel-en-eurocup-la-saison-prochaine/|publisher=Basket Europe|language=fr|date=13 March 2017|title=L’ASVEL en Eurocup la saison prochaine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National teams windows==
For the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup|2019 World Cup]], FIBA established a new qualification system, using six weekends during the 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons, when the qualifiers will interrupt the club competitions. In May 2017, the [[National Basketball Association]] made a statement that the NBA teams will not loan their players to the national teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2707252-non-nba-players-to-make-up-team-usa-roster-for-2019-fiba-world-cup-qualifying|publisher=Bleacher Report|date=2 May 2017|access-date=16 May 2017|title=Non-NBA Players to Make Up Team USA Roster for 2019 FIBA World Cup Qualifying}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, Euroleague Basketball's CEO [[Jordi Bertomeu]] made the same statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/en/euroleague/448736/bertomeu-teams-already-decided-keep-calender/|publisher=Eurohoops.net|date=15 May 2017|access-date=16 May 2017|title=Bertomeu: “The teams have already decided to keep the same calender”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first window, the majority of European players that play in the [[2017–18 EuroLeague]] were called up for their national teams, but they all refused to join them.

The '''20th World Science Fiction Convention''', also known unofficially as '''Chicon III''' (less frequently, '''Chicon II'''), was held August 31–September 3, 1962, at the [[Congress Plaza Hotel|Pick-Congress Hotel]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], United States.

Because the second [[Worldcon]] held in Chicago was officially called, in its publications, the 10th Annual World Science Fiction Convention (and once as the "10th Annual Science Fiction Convention") and not Chicon, the next Chicago Worldcon held in 1962 was occasionally referred to as Chicon II, though Chicon III is the generally accepted and preferred nomenclature.

&lt;!-- The supporting organization was the [[ORG]]. --&gt;The chairman was [[Earl Kemp]]. The guest of honor was [[Theodore Sturgeon]].&lt;ref name="goh2"/&gt;  The toastmaster was [[Wilson Tucker]]. Total attendance was approximately 730.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

Following the convention, [[Advent (publisher)|Advent:Publishers]] published ''The Proceedings: Chicon III'', edited by [[Earl Kemp]].&lt;ref name="goh1"/&gt; The book includes transcripts of lectures and panels given during the course of the convention and includes numerous photographs as well. Events at the convention included an address by [[Willy Ley]].&lt;ref name="cdt620916"/&gt;

==Events==
During his Guest of Honor speech, Theodore Sturgeon expressed regret that Hugo Award winner [[Robert A. Heinlein]] could not attend. Heinlein, at that moment, walked into the ballroom, in a white tux, saying that Ted's regret for his nonattendance was premature. He went to the podium, and Sturgeon offered him a sip from a water glass, asking Heinlein to share water with him (a reference to ''Stranger in a Strange Land''.)  Heinlein and Sturgeon shared water.

Before the convention, in 1961, chairman [[Earl Kemp]] wrote to [[Isaac Asimov]] relaying that someone had jokingly suggested that Asimov deliver a pseudo-lecture on the theme "The Positive Power of Posterior Pinching" and offered that the convention would "furnish some suitable posteriors for demonstration purposes."&lt;ref name="almostd1"/&gt; Asimov responded, "I have no doubt I could give a stimulating talk that would stiffen the manly fiber of every one in the audience." However, he noted, "I will have to ask the permission of various people who are (or would be) concerned in the matter. If they say 'no', it will be 'no.'"&lt;ref name="almostd1"/&gt; The suggested pseudo-lecture did not occur.

==In fiction==
[[S. M. Stirling]]'s 2008 [[alternate history]] novel ''[[In the Courts of the Crimson Kings]]'' begins with a prologue set at this convention, in which a group of the science fiction authors in attendance watch a television broadcast of an American [[space probe]] as it lands on an inhabited Mars. Those present include [[Frederik Pohl|Frederik]] and Carol Pohl, [[Poul Anderson]], [[H. Beam Piper]], Guest of Honor [[Theodore Sturgeon]], [[Jack Williamson]], [[Robert A. Heinlein|Robert]] and [[Virginia Heinlein]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]], [[Larry Niven]], [[Isaac Asimov]], [[L. Sprague de Camp|L. Sprague]] and [[Catherine Crook de Camp]], [[John W. Campbell]], [[Frank Herbert]], and [[Leigh Brackett]]. Heinlein mentions an idea for a novel about Mars he had had but set aside when "the preliminary orbital telescope reports" had come in. (In actual history the completed book, ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', won the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] at the convention.) The authors comment as the broadcast from the probe reveals a Martian canal and wildlife and then, startlingly, the arrival of human-like Martians in a "land ship" who haul the probe off.

Bhagat wrote this novel after quitting his job as an investment banker. This is his fourth book after ''[[Five Point Someone]]'', ''[[One Night @ the Call Center]]'' and ''[[The Three Mistakes of My Life]]''.

== Plot summary ==

2 States: The Story of My Marriage is partly autobiographical. The story is about a couple, Krish and Ananya, who fall from two different states of India, Punjab and Tamil Nadu respectively, are deeply in love and want to get married.

The story begins in the IIM Ahmedabad mess hall, where Krish, a Punjabi boy from Delhi sights a beautiful girl, Ananya, a Tamilian from Chennai, quarreling with the mess staff about the food. Ananya was tagged as the "Best girl of the fresher batch". They become friends within a few days and decide to study together every night. In the mean time, they become romantically involved. They both get jobs, and have serious plans for their wedding. At first Krish tries to convince his girlfriend Ananya's parents and at last convinces them by helping Ananya's father to do his first PowerPoint Presentation, her brother, Manju, by giving him IIT tuition and later convinces her mom by asking her to sing in a concert organised by Krish's off City at CitiBank. She is convinced as her biggest dream of singing at a big concert comes true. Then they try to convince Krish's mom. But the problem is Krish's mother's relatives who don't quite like this. They say that Krish should not marry a Tamilian but end up agreeing with them when Ananya tries to help one of Krish's cousin to get married and succeeds to do so. Krish has had a hatred on his father. He never shares his feelings or doesn't share a harmonious bonding with him. Now as they have convinced both their parents they now try to introduce each other's parents. They go to Goa. But this dream of theirs end as Ananya's parents finds something fishy between Krish's mom and him. Ananya's family end up deciding that Krish and Ananya will not marry each other.  Krish started becoming workaholic and started living badly. But, at last, Krish's father, who was like an enemy for Krish, helps Krish and Ananya to get married as he convinces Ananya's family well. Now Krish realizes his Dad's love for him. They really do very hard to convince each other's parents and finally make it. It is narrated in a first person point of view in a humorous tone, often taking digs at both Tamil and Punjabi cultures . The novel ends with Ananya giving birth to twin boys. He says that the babies belong to a state called 'India'; with a thought to end inequality.

==Film adaptation==
{{main|2 States (film)}}
When a film adaptation of the novel was first announced, it was to be directed by [[Siddharth Anand]] and the lead roles were played by [[Arjun Kapoor]] and [[Alia Bhatt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/1245384/Saif--Priyanka-in-Siddharth-Anands-adaptation-of-Chetan-Bhagats-2-States|title=Saif &amp; Priyanka in Siddharth Anand's adaptation of Chetan Bhagat's '2 States' {{!}}  Bollywood News {{!}} Hindi Movies News {{!}} News - BollywoodHungama.com|last=Hungama|first=Bollywood|website=Bollywood Hungama|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music to be composed by [[Vishal Shekhar|Vishal-Shekhar]]. However, the project was called off due to creative differences over script.

Later, it was announced that the screen adaptation of 2 States would be produced by [[Sajid Nadiadwala]] with [[Shahrukh Khan]] and Priyanka Chopra in the lead roles and [[Vishal Bhardwaj]] would be directing the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news-interviews/Shah-Rukh-Khan-Priyanka-Chopra-re-ignite-2-States/articleshow/8960147.cms|title=Shah Rukh Khan, Priyanka Chopra re-ignite 2 States | newspaper=Times of India|date=23 June 2011|first=Subhash K|last=Jha|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since Shahrukh Khan did not want to appear in back to back romantic movies, the director had to look at other options. It was later declared that [[Imran Khan (Bollywood actor)|Imran Khan]] will be playing the male lead in the movie. But then, due to clash of dates, Imran and Priyanka had to opt out of the movie as well. After a lot of brainstorming, it was finally confirmed by producers [[Karan Johar]] and [[Sajid Nadiadwala]] that [[Arjun Kapoor]] and [[Alia Bhatt]] will be seen playing the lead pair in the movie. [[Amrita Singh]] and [[Ronit Roy]] were cast as Arjun Kapoor's parents and [[Revathy]] and [[Shiv Kumar Subramaniam]] were cast as Alia Bhatt's parents.

This movie was released on 18 April 2014.

| quote       = The title, A Second Knock At The Door, is a tell-tale application of the emotions involved in these family’s experiences. After being told that their soldier was killed by mortar fire from an enemy or a car accident they discover, most often months later, that their kin was killed by friendly fire. In some cases the army went to great lengths to cover up the exact details of how the {{sic|solider}} was killed. It is alarming to consider that the U.S. Army would lie about a soldier’s death to save face, but they’re only human.

The '''Age of Revolution''' is the period from approximately 1774 to 1849 in which a number of significant [[revolution]]ary movements occurred in many parts of Europe and the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Matson, Cathy|title=The Atlantic Economy in an Era of Revolutions: An Introduction|publisher=William and Mary Quarterly|date=July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period is noted for the change in government from [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist monarchies]] to [[constitutionalist|constitutionalist states]] and [[republic]]s. The Age of Revolution includes the [[American Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]], the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], the [[Haitian Revolution]], the revolt of [[slave]]s in [[Latin America]], the [[First Italian War of Independence]], [[Sicilian revolution of 1848]], and the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|1848 revolutions in Italy]]; and the independence movements of Spanish and Portuguese colonies in Latin America. In a way, it includes the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The period would generally weaken the [[imperialism|imperialist]] European states, who would lose major assets throughout the [[New World]]. For the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], the loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] would bring a [[British Empire#Rise of the "Second" British Empire (1783–1815)|change in direction]] for the [[British Empire]], with [[Asia]] and the [[Pacific]] becoming new targets for expansion.

The expression was popularised by the British historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] in his book ''[[The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848]].''&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm, Eric, ''The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848'', London, Abacus (1962). &lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial Revolution==
{{Main|Industrial Revolution}}
The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. It marked a major turning point in history and almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. This led to the expansion of cities that was so rapid, it resulted in social strains and disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory of Collective Behavior|last=Smelser|first=Neil|publisher=Quid Pro Books|year=2011|isbn=9781610270854|location=New Orleans|pages=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, economic grievances associated with this industrialization fed later revolutions such as those that transpired from 1848.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Industrial Revolution: Steam and Steel|last=Wolfe|first=James|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2015|isbn=9781680480283|location=New York|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; New social classes emerged including those that began to reject orthodox politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Industrial Revolution|last=Hudson|first=Pat|publisher=Hodder Arnold|year=1992|isbn=9780713165319|location=New York|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is demonstrated by the rise of the urban [[middle class]], which became a powerful force so that they had to be integrated into the political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Empire to Europe: The Decline and Revival of British Industry Since the Second World War|last=Owens|first=Geoffrey|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=2017|isbn=9780006387503|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upheavals also led to new political ideas that were directed against the social arrangements of the preindustrial regime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==American Revolution (1775–1783)==
{{Main|American Revolution}}
The [[Thirteen Colonies]] of British America famously became independent in the [[American Revolution]] of 1776. The movement was the first European colony to claim independence and saw the application of elected government, a constitution, and limited civil rights, none of which were unheard of but were unique in their combination. This was the birth of the United States of America.

==French Revolution (1789–1799)==
{{Main|French Revolution}}
The French Revolution was a period of radical social and political upheaval in France from 1789 to 1799 that profoundly affected French and modern history, marking the decline of powerful monarchies and churches and the rise of democracy and nationalism. Popular resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the clergy and aristocracy grew amidst an economic crisis following two expensive wars and years of bad harvests, motivating demands for change. These were couched in terms of Enlightenment ideals and caused the convocation of the Estates-General in May 1789.

==Haitian Revolution (1791–1804)==
{{Main|Haitian Revolution}}
The Haitian Revolution was a slave revolt in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, which culminated in the elimination of slavery there and the founding of the Republic of Haiti. The Haitian Revolution was the only slave revolt which led to the founding of a state. Furthermore, it is generally considered the most successful slave rebellion ever to have occurred and as a defining moment in the histories of both Europe and the Americas. The rebellion began with a revolt of black African slaves in August 1791. It ended in November 1803 with the French defeat at the battle of Vertières. Haiti became an independent country on January 1, 1804.

==United Irishmen Rebellion (1798)==
{{Main|Irish Rebellion of 1798}}
In 1798, Irishmen rose against British Rule in Ireland in the hopes of creating a Republic. The rebellion was initiated by the Society of United Irishmen and led by Theobald Wolfe Tone. They rebelled against the government for a number of reasons but most notably due to the sectarian nature of British Rule, which upheld the Penal Laws that discrimated against Catholics and Presbyterians in Irish society. The rebellion failed and led to the Act of Union in 1801.

== Serbian Revolution (1804–1835) ==
{{Main|Serbian Revolution}}
The Serbian Revolution was a national uprising and constitutional change in [[Serbia]] that took place between 1804 and 1835, during which the territory evolved from an [[Belgrade Pashaluk|Ottoman province]] into a rebel territory, a [[Constitution of Serbia|constitutional monarchy]], and finally the modern Serbian state. The first part of the period, from 1804 to 1815, was marked by a violent struggle for independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] with two armed uprisings taking place, ending with a ceasefire. During the later period (1815–1835) a peaceful consolidation of political power developed in the increasingly autonomous Serbia, culminating in the recognition of the right to hereditary rule by [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian princes]] in 1830 and 1833 and the territorial expansion of the young monarchy. The adoption of the first written [[Constitution of Serbia|Constitution]] in 1835 abolished [[feudalism]] and [[serfdom]], and made the country [[Suzerainty|suzerain]]. The term "Serbian Revolution" was coined by a German academic historiographer, [[Leopold von Ranke]], in his book ''Die Serbische Revolution'', published in 1829. These events marked the foundation of the modern [[Principality of Serbia]].

Scholars have characterized the Serbian War of Independence and subsequent national liberation as a revolution because the uprisings were started by broad masses of rural Serbian people who were in severe class conflict with the Turkish landowners as a political and economic masters at the same time, similar to [[Greek War of Independence|Greece in 1821–1832]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Latin American Wars of Independence (1808–1833)==
{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence|War of Independence of Brazil}}

Latin America experienced [[Spanish American wars of independence|independence revolutions]] in the early 19th century that separated the colonies from [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], creating new nations. These movements were generally led by the ethnically Spanish but locally born [[Creole people|Creole]] class; these were often wealthy citizens that held high positions of power but were still poorly respected by the European-born Spaniards. One such Creole was [[Simón Bolívar]], who led several revolutions throughout South America and helped establish [[Gran Colombia]]. Another important figure was [[José de San Martín]], who helped create the [[United Provinces of Rio de la Plata]] and became the first president of [[Peru]]. Some Latin American revolts, such as the Haitian Revolution, were led by slaves.

==Greek War of Independence (1821–1832)==
{{Main|Greek War of Independence}}
Greece in the early part of the 1800s was under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. A series of revolts, starting in 1821, began the conflict. The Ottoman Empire sent in forces to suppress the revolts. By 1827, forces from Russia, Great Britain, and France entered the conflict, helping the Greeks drive the Turkish forces off the Peloponnese Peninsula. The Turks finally recognized Greece as a free nation in May 1832.

==Revolutions of 1820==
{{main|Revolutions of 1820}}

==Revolutions of 1830==
{{main|Revolutions of 1830}}

==Revolutions of 1848==
{{Main|Revolutions of 1848}}
The European Revolutions of 1848, known in some countries as the Spring of Nations, Springtime of the Peoples or the Year of Revolution, were a series of political upheavals throughout Europe in 1848. It remains the most widespread revolutionary wave in European history, but within a year, reactionary forces had regained control, and the revolutions collapsed. 

The political impact of the 1848 revolutions was more evident in Austria in comparison to the revolution's effects in countries like Germany. This is attributed to the way the upheavals in Vienna resulted in greater loss of life and gained stronger support from intellectuals, students, and the working class.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The 1848 Revolutions in German-Speaking Europe|last=Hahn|first=Hans Joachim|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780582357655|location=Oxon|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; An account described the German experience as less concerned with national issues, although it succeeded in breaking down class barriers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There was a previously prevalent view that there was only one revolutionary event in Germany but recent scholarship pointed to a fragmented picture of several revolutions happening at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Revolutions in Europe, 1848-1849: From Reform to Reaction|last=Evans|first=Robert John|last2=von Strandmann|first2=Hartmut Pogge|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0199249970|location=Oxford|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1848 revolutions were also notable because of the increased participation of women. While women rarely participated in revolutionary activities, there were those who performed supportive and auxiliary roles such as the cases of the women's political club in [[Vienna]], which demanded revolutionary measures from the Austrian Constituent Assembly, and the Parisian women who protested and proposed their own solutions to social problems, particularly those involving their rights and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The European Revolutions, 1848-1851|last=Sperber|first=Jonathan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=0521839076|location=Cambridge|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Eureka Rebellion (1856)==
{{Main|Eureka Rebellion}}
The Eureka Rebellion was a 20 minute shootout between the Miners of Ballarat, Victoria, against the British Redcoats. After the imposition of Gold Mining Licences, that being that a person had one of these to mine gold, and which costed 30 shillings a month to own a license, the miners decided that it was to much. So the Ballarat Miners started rallies at Bakery Hill and burnt their licenses, took an oath under the flag of the Southern Cross, elected Peter Lalor as their rebellion leader, and built a stockade (a makeshift fort) around the diggings. Eventually the Redcoats led by Governor Hotham of Ballarat fired upon the stockade. The miners fired back and lasted 20 minutes before being overthrown by the Redcoats. Most of the miners were arrested by the British, and taken to trial. If found guilty, they would hang for high treason. Even though it lasted only 20 minutes, it was the beginning of Democracy for all Australians.

==Taiping Revolution (1850-1864)==
{{Main|Taiping Rebellion}}
The Taiping Rebellion was a revolt against the [[Qing dynasty]] in China, fought with religious conviction over regional economic conditions, and lasting from 1850 to 1864. The Taiping forces were run as a cult-like group called the God Worshipping Society by self-proclaimed prophet [[Hong Xiuquan]], and resulted in the rebels seizing the city of [[Nanjing]] for a decade. The Taiping Rebellion eventually failed, however, and led to the deaths of more than 20 million people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4738">'''Cantagiro''' was an Italian summer festival held from 1962 to 1972 and 1990 to 1993. It featured three categories, A for famous artists, B for newcomers and C for groups. The creator of the competition was [[Ezio Radaelli]]. The name of the festival was a reference to the [[Bicycle racing|bicycle race]] [[Giro d'Italia]], and, as the Giro, Cantagiro was organized as a [[stage race]] consisting of eleven or twelve daily stages, each set in a different city.&lt;ref name=hd&gt;{{cite book|last=Felice Liperi|title=Storia della canzone italiana|publisher=RAI-ERI, 1999|isbn=8839710647}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hhd&gt;{{cite book|last=Aldo Grasso|title=Radio e televisione|publisher=Vita e Pensiero, 2000|isbn=8834305787}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gianfranco Salvatore|title=L'arcobaleno: storia vera di Lucio Battisti vissuta da Mogol e dagli altri che c'erano|publisher=Giunti Editore, 2000|isbn=8809018052|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A peculiar characteristic of the festival was that, while traveling between one stage and the other, singers were required to travel in an open car, to be at the disposal of the crowd of fans, otherwise risking fines or disqualification from the competition; accordingly the travel usually resolved into a huge crowd, with fans waiting their idols in every corner of the path.&lt;ref name="hd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Claudia Provvedini|title=Morto Ezio Radaelli inventore del Cantagiro e "patron" di Sanremo|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2005/ottobre/16/Morto_Ezio_Radaelli_inventore_del_co_9_051016020.shtml|accessdate=4 November 2013|newspaper=[[Corriere della Sera]]|date=16 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival was the main subject of two [[musicarello]] films, ''Urlo contro melodia nel Cantagiro 1963'' (1964) and ''La più bella coppia del mondo'' (1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberto Poppi, Mario Pecorari|title=Dizionario del cinema italiano.

The '''Cine Las Americas International Film Festival''' is an annual [[film festival]] based in [[Austin, Texas]] featuring Latin American and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] films from the Americas.  In its 14th year in 2011, the Festival has grown into a citywide event, with over 100 screenings in a nine-day span. Patrons of the festival are offered a wide variety of films to choose from including narrative and documentary features, short films, animation and youth films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persistenceofvision.org/2010/10/14th-cine-las-americas-international-film-festival-deadline-january-14/ 14th Cine Las Americas International Film Festival Call for Entries], ''Persistence of Vision'', Journal of the Austin Film Society, AFS Communications Dept., 2010-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.originalalamo.com/Signature.aspx?id=78 Cine Las Americas Film Festival]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, 2011.

==Organization==
Cine Las Americas, a [[501(c)#501.28c.29.283.29|501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization, is a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] organization that offers cultural experiences and business opportunities for Latinos in film and media arts, and brings media arts education to minority youth in Austin. While the international film festival seeks to become an institution in the international film business and trade, fostering multi-national film production, and accessing emerging markets and diverse audiences, Cine Las Americas remains a community oriented Media Arts Center, offering diverse opportunities for culture, education and fun.&lt;ref name="cla"&gt;[http://cinelasamericas.org/about/about_history.html About Us, History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621184404/http://www.cinelasamericas.org/about/about_history.html |date=2009-06-21 }}, Cine Las Americas.

==Festival history==
The Cine Las Americas International Film festival began in 1997 as a Cuban film [[retrospective]] sponsored by the [[Mexic-Arte Museum]] in [[Austin, Texas]]. While programming the initial event, the organizers realized that although Austin was building its reputation as an important city for producing and showcasing independent film, films made by and about Latinos were largely absent from the community's [[cultural landscape]]. In 2001, Cine Las Americas partnered with the [[Austin Independent School District]] (AISD) and moved the organization's offices to [[Johnston High School]] in East Austin, where it established a Media Arts Center, implementing educational and mentoring programs to support the District's Dropout Prevention Campaign. During this time the organization offered the school's students hands-on [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] opportunities in [[multimedia]] production, event production, and non-profit organization management.&lt;ref name="cla" /&gt;

===Festival-related programs and milestones===
The training students received in the Cine Las Americas-school district partnership culminated in students producing ''Emergencia'', the youth component of the film festival. In ''Emergencia'' they receive entries from around the country, preview them in order to [[Curator|curate]] a program, grant awards for the best work, and produce a day of free screenings within the context of the festival. ''Emergencia'' remains a special competitive section of the festival open to filmmakers ages 19 and under and is [[Curator|curated]] by students participating in Cine Las Americas' multicultural Media Literacy programs.

In 2003, professional musicians and other guest artists began to instruct and [[Mentorship|mentor]] dozens of students at a [[recording studio]] inside the organization's classroom at the school. There, students were able to write and record music and lyrics in a professional studio environment within a bilingual Digital Music Production [[curriculum]] in the after-school program ''BeatLab''. Many students have used skills learned there in preparing work for subsequent Festivals. ''BeatLab'' has continued at other area schools since the organization's offices moved to East Austin after its contract with the school expired.

Also in 2003, the festival extended its program to include indigenous work from the Americas, established competitive sections granting [[Juried (competition)|juried]] and audience awards.

By 2005, the organization had presented more than 300 films at the annual Festival and at various screenings throughout Texas, collaborating with institutions such as The [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]] (MFAH), the [[South By Southwest]] film festival (SXSW), and the [[Austin Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100510003612/http://www.austinfilmfestival.com/new/31_minutes AFF &amp; Cine Las Americas International Film Festival Present...31 MINUTES], Austin Film Festival, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Festival expanded to its current format in celebration of Cine Las Americas' 10th anniversary.

The 13th annual Cine Las Americas International Film Festival was held April 21–29, 2010, and featured [[Mexico]] as the invited country in celebration of Mexico's [[Celebration of Mexican political anniversaries in 2010|bicentennial]].

[[Economist]] [[Jeffrey Sachs]] described the United States as a corporatocracy in ''[[The Price of Civilization]]'' (2011).&lt;ref name="sachs price of civilization"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Sachs  | first = Jeffrey  | title = ''The Price of Civilization''  | publisher = Random House  | year = 2011  | location = New York  | pages = 105, 106, 107  | isbn = 978-1-4000-6841-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that it arose from four trends: weak [[Political parties in the United States|national parties]] and strong political representation of individual districts, the large U.S. military establishment after [[World War II]], large corporations [[corporate political donations|using money to finance election campaigns]], and [[globalization]] tilting the balance of power away from workers.&lt;ref name="sachs price of civilization"/&gt;

This collective is what author [[C Wright Mills]] in 1956 called the '[[power elite]]', wealthy individuals who hold prominent positions in corporatocracies. They control the process of determining a society's economic and political policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Doob| first = Christopher| title = Social Inequality and Social Stratification | publisher = Pearson | edition = 1st| year = 2013| location = Boston| pages = 143| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

[[Edmund Phelps]] published an analysis in 2010 theorizing that the cause of [[income inequality]] is not free market capitalism, but instead is the result of the rise of [[corporatization]].&lt;ref name="columbia.edu"&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~esp2/Critical%20Review%20Piece.pdf Capitalism vs Corporatism - Edmund Phelps] ''[[Columbia University]].'' January 11, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Corporatization, in his view, is the antithesis of free market capitalism.  It is characterized by semi-monopolistic organizations and banks, big employer confederations, often acting with complicit state institutions in ways that discourage (or block) the natural workings of a free economy.  The primary effects of corporatization are the consolidation of economic power and wealth, with end results being the attrition of entrepreneurial and free market dynamism.

His follow-up book, ''Mass Flourishing'', further defines corporatization by the following attributes: power-sharing between government and large corporations (exemplified in the U.S. by widening government power in areas such as financial services, healthcare, energy, law enforcement/[[Private prison|prison systems]], and the [[Private military company|military]] through regulation and outsourcing), an expansion of corporate lobbying and campaign support in exchange for government reciprocity, escalation in the growth and influence of financial and banking sectors, increased consolidation of the corporate landscape through merger and acquisition (with ensuing increases in corporate executive compensation), increased potential for corporate/government corruption and malfeasance, and a lack of entrepreneurial and small business development leading to lethargic and stagnant economic conditions.&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phelps|first1=Edmund|title=Mass Flourishing: How Grassroots Innovation Created Jobs, Challenge, and Change|date=August 25, 2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691158983|page=392|edition=1st|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mass-Flourishing-Grassroots-Innovation-Challenge/dp/0691158983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324549004579066790248178438|title=Book Review: 'Mass Flourishing' by Edmund Phelps|author=Edward Glaeser|date=18 October 2013|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
[[File:U.S. Compensation as Percent of GDP - v1.png|right|thumb|400px|Labor's share of GDP has declined 1970 to 2013, measured based on total compensation as well as salaries and wages. This implies capital's share is increasing.]]

In the United States, several of the characteristics described by Phelps are apparent. With regard to income inequality, the 2014 income analysis of [[University of California, Berkeley]] economist [[Emmanuel Saez]] confirms that relative growth of income and wealth is not occurring among small and mid-sized entrepreneurs and business owners (who generally populate the lower half of top one per-centers in income),&lt;ref&gt;[https://thecfoalliance.org/documents/CFO_Alliance_Executive_Compensation_Survey_Presentation_Final_1_10_2013.pdf The CFO Alliance Executive Compensation Survey 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; but instead only among the top .1 percent of income distribution ... whom Economics Nobel  Prize winner, Paul Krugman describes as "super-elites – corporate bigwigs and financial wheeler-dealers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/25/opinion/we-are-the-99-9.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;ref=opinion&amp;adxnnlx=1413381816-Gy6K3nXHunUOH3N8AnSa7Q We Are The 99.9%, Paul Krugman, New York Times, November 24, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/03/how-you-i-and-everyone-got-the-top-1-percent-all-wrong/359862/|title=How You, I, and Everyone Got the Top 1 Percent All Wrong|author=Derek Thompson|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;... who earn $2,000,000 or more every year.&lt;ref name="gabriel-zucman.eu"&gt;[http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/SaezZucman2014Slides.pdf The Distribution of US Wealth, Capital Income and Returns since 1913, Emmanuel Saez, Gabriel Zucman], March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/phildemuth/2013/11/25/are-you-rich-enough-the-terrible-tragedy-of-income-inequality-among-the-1/|title=Are You Rich Enough? The Terrible Tragedy Of Income Inequality Among The 1%|author=Phil DeMuth|work=Forbes|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Share of income===
Corporate power can also increase income inequality. Nobel Prize winner of Economics, [[Joseph Stiglitz]] wrote in May 2011: "Much of today’s inequality is due to manipulation of the financial system, enabled by changes in the rules that have been bought and paid for by the financial industry itself—one of its best investments ever. The government lent money to financial institutions at close to zero percent interest and provided generous bailouts on favorable terms when all else failed. Regulators turned a blind eye to a lack of transparency and to conflicts of interest." Stiglitz explained that the top 1% got nearly "one-quarter" of the income and own approximately 40% of the wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105|title=Of the 1%, by the 1%, for the 1%|author=Joseph E. Stiglitz|work=Vanity Fair|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measured relative to GDP, total compensation and its component wages and salaries have been declining since 1970. This indicates a shift in income from labor (persons who derive income from hourly wages and salaries) to capital (persons who derive income via ownership of businesses, land and assets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/monetary-policy-and-long-term-trends|title=Monetary policy and long-term trends|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wages and salaries have fallen from approximately 51% GDP in 1970 to 43% GDP in 2013.{{update-inline|date=October 2018}} Total compensation has fallen from approximately 58% GDP in 1970 to 53% GDP in 2013.{{update-inline|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=205101&amp;updated=1530|title=FRED Graph|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=October 2018}}

To put this in perspective,{{editorializing|date=October 2018}} five percent of U.S. GDP was approximately $850 billion in 2013. This represents an additional $7,000 in compensation for each of the 120 million U.S. households. [[Larry Summers]] estimated in 2007 that the lower 80% of families were receiving $664 billion less income than they would be with a 1979 income distribution (a period of much greater equality), or approximately $7,000 per family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larrysummers.com/commentary/financial-times-columns/harness-market-forces-to-share-prosperity-june-24-2007/|title=Harness market forces to share prosperity |author=Larry Summers|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not receiving this income may have led many families to increase their debt burden, a significant factor in the 2007–2009 [[subprime mortgage crisis]], as highly leveraged homeowners suffered a much larger reduction in their net worth during the crisis. Further, since lower income families tend to spend relatively more of their income than higher income families, shifting more of the income to wealthier families may slow economic growth.&lt;ref name="Mian and Sufi2014"&gt;{{cite book

===Effective corporate tax rates===
[[File:U.S. Federal Corporate Income Tax Receipts and Pre-Tax Profits.png|thumb|right|400px|U.S. corporate effective tax rates have fallen significantly since the year 2000.]]
As another indication of U.S. corporate political influence, U.S. corporate effective tax rates have also fallen significantly, from 29% in 2000 to 17% in 2013. Corporate tax payments have not kept pace with profit growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=122345&amp;category_id=7443|title=FRED Graph|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{OR|date=August 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:OR requires secondary sources, but this paragraph uses a primary source to support an editor's narrative. --&gt;

Some large U.S. corporations have used a strategy called [[tax inversion]] to change their headquarters to a non-U.S. country to reduce their tax liability. About 46 companies have reincorporated in low-tax countries since 1982, including 15 since 2012. Six more also planned to do so in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/quicktake/tax-inversion|title=Tax Inversion|work=BloombergView.com|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stock buybacks versus wage increases===
One indication of increasing corporate power was the removal of restrictions on their ability to buy back stock, contributing to increased income inequality. Writing in the ''Harvard Business Review'' in September 2014, William Lazonick blamed record corporate [[share repurchase|stock buybacks]] for reduced investment in the economy and a corresponding impact on prosperity and income inequality.  Between 2003 and 2012, the 449 companies in the S&amp;P 500 used 54% of their earnings ($2.4 trillion) to buy back their own stock.  An additional 37% was paid to stockholders as dividends. Together, these were 91% of profits. This left little for investment in productive capabilities or higher income for employees, shifting more income to capital rather than labor.  He blamed executive compensation arrangements, which are heavily based on stock options, stock awards and bonuses for meeting earnings per share (EPS) targets. EPS increases as the number of outstanding shares decreases. Legal restrictions on buybacks were greatly eased in the early 1980s. He advocates changing these incentives to limit buybacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity/ar/1|title=Profits Without Prosperity|work=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/harold-meyerson-in-corporations-its-owner-take-all/2014/08/26/0c1a002a-2ca7-11e4-bb9b-997ae96fad33_story.html|title=In corporations, it’s owner-take-all|author=Harold Meyerson|date=26 August 2014|work=Washington Post|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12 months to March 31, 2014, S&amp;P 500 companies increased their stock buyback payouts by 29% year on year, to $534.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ef626fc4-f6f7-11e3-b271-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3IVLb48yU|title=US share buybacks and dividends hit record|work=Financial Times|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. companies are projected to increase buybacks to $701 billion in 2015 according to Goldman Sachs, an 18% increase over 2014. For scale, annual non-residential fixed investment (a proxy for business investment and a major GDP component) was estimated to be about $2.1 trillion for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2014/txt/gdp3q14_adv.txt BEA-GDP Press Release-Q3 2014 Advance Estimate-October 30, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/102173955#.CNBC-Jeff Cox-Stock Buybacks Expected to Jump 18% in 2015-November 11, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry concentration===
{{See also|Too big to fail|Concentration of media ownership}}
[[File:5-Bank Asset Concentration in U.S. 1997-2012.png|thumb|350px|Percentage of banking assets held by largest five U.S. banks from 1997-2011.]]

Brid Brennan of the Transnational Institute explained how concentration of corporations increases their influence over government: ”It’s not just their size, their enormous wealth and assets that make the TNCs [transnational corporations] dangerous to democracy. It’s also their concentration, their capacity to influence, and often infiltrate, governments and their ability to act as a genuine international social class in order to defend their commercial interests against the common good. It is such decision making power as well as the power to impose deregulation over the past 30 years, resulting in changes to national constitutions, and to national and international legislation which has created the environment for corporate crime and impunity."&lt;ref name=Brennan2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/article/state-corporate-power|title=The State of Corporate Power|work=Transnational Institute|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/briefing/state-power-2014|title=State of Power 2014|work=Transnational Institute|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of such industry concentration is in banking. The top 5 U.S. banks had approximately 30% of the U.S. banking assets in 1998; this rose to 45% by 2008 and to 48% by 2010, before falling to 47% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DDOI06USA156NWDB|title=5-Bank Asset Concentration for United States|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Economist]] also explained how an increasingly profitable corporate financial and banking sector caused Gini coefficients to rise in the U.S. since 1980: "Financial services' share of GDP in America doubled to 8% between 1980 and 2000; over the same period their profits rose from about 10% to 35% of total corporate profits, before collapsing in 2007–09. Bankers are being paid more, too. In America the compensation of workers in financial services was similar to average compensation until 1980. Now it is twice that average."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17957381|title=Unbottled Gini|work=The Economist|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The summary argument, considering these findings, is that if corporatization is the consolidation and sharing of economic and political power between large corporations and the state ... then a corresponding concentration of income and wealth (with resulting income inequality) is an expected by-product of such a consolidation.&lt;ref name=Brennan2014/&gt;

===Corporate influence on legislation===
{{main|Regulatory capture}}
Corporations have significant influence on the regulations and regulators that monitor them. For example, Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] explained in December 2014 how an omnibus spending bill required to fund the government was modified late in the process to weaken banking regulations. The modification made it easier to allow taxpayer-funded bailouts of banking "swaps entities", which the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank]] banking regulations prohibited. She singled out [[Citigroup]], one of the largest banks, which had a role in modifying the legislation. She also explained how both Wall Street bankers and members of the government that formerly had worked on Wall Street stopped bi-partisan legislation that would have broken up the largest banks. She repeated President Theodore Roosevelt's warnings regarding powerful corporate entities that threatened the "very foundations of Democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJpTxONxvoo&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Remarks by Senator Warren on Citigroup and its bailout provision|date=12 December 2014|work=YouTube|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Start zum Red Bull Dolomitenmann.jpg|thumb|Start of the 19th Dolomitenmann in 2006]]
The '''Dolomitenmann''' is an [[extreme sports]] [[relay race]] held in September in the [[East Tyrol|East Tyrolean]], or [[Dolomites|Dolomite]] Mountains of [[Austria]], near the city of [[Lienz]]. The founder and organiser is [[Werner Grissmann]], a former [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup|World Cup skier]]. 

The Dolomitenmann relay race has been run annually since 1988. In recent years the race has been sponsored by the manufacturers of [[Red Bull]] energy drink and is now known as ''Red Bull Dolomitenmann''. The race is billed by its organizers as "the world's toughest team relay race".

== Course ==
The race is started by the ''mountain runner'' on the town square of Lienz at {{convert|674|m|ft|}} above sea level. who then runs a distance of around {{convert|12|km|mi}} up to ''Kühbodentörl'' at {{convert|2441|m|ft|}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.redbulldolomitenmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/racebook_berglauf_d_2016.pdf | title=Racebook Berglauf 2016 | trans-title=Racebook mountain running 2016 | accessdate=2016-11-28 | language=de | format=PDF | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128195938/http://www.redbulldolomitenmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/racebook_berglauf_d_2016.pdf | archivedate=2016-11-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the runner makes the hand-off to the team’s ''paraglider'', he must also run, this time with his whole equipment to the first take-off point. After descending by air to Moosalm, the paraglider runs to a second take-off point, descending to Leisach where the ''mountain biker'' is ready and waiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.redbulldolomitenmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/racebook_paragleiten_d_2016.pdf | title=Racebook Paragleiten 2016 | trans-title=Racebook paragliding 2016 | accessdate=2016-11-28 | language=de | format=PDF | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128200348/http://www.redbulldolomitenmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/racebook_paragleiten_d_2016.pdf | archivedate=2016-11-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''mountain biker'' typically climbs {{convert|1600|m|ft|}} or more, over a distance of about {{convert|27|km|mi}}. After the climb, the mountain biker must ride a downhill track to the finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.redbulldolomitenmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/racebook_bike_d_2016.pdf | title=Racebook Mountainbike 2016 | accessdate=2016-11-28 | language=de | format=PDF | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128195733/http://www.redbulldolomitenmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/racebook_bike_d_2016.pdf | archivedate=2016-11-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teams ''kayaker'' swims across the river [[Drau]] where his boat is stationed. His first maneuver is an "alpine-start", or a drop off a {{convert|7|m|ft}} ramp into the river. After the jump the ''kayaker'' must navigate a difficult white water track on the river {{ill|Isel (river)|lt=Isel|de|Isel}} before a last sprint back to the main square of Lienz.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.redbulldolomitenmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/racebook_kajak_d.pdf | title=Racebook Kajak 2016 | trans-title=Racebook whitewater kayak 2016 | accessdate=2016-11-28 | language=de | format=PDF | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128200211/http://www.redbulldolomitenmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/racebook_kajak_d.pdf | archivedate=2016-11-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elephant Festival''' is a festival celebrated in [[Jaipur]] city in [[Rajasthan]] state in [[India]]. It is held on the day of [[Holi]] festival, usually in the month of March. The festival features [[Elephant polo]] and Elephant Dance. The Elephant Festival begins with a beautiful procession of bedecked elephants, [[camel]]s, [[horse]]s and [[Folk dance in India|folk dancers]]. The owners proudly embellish their elephants with vibrant colours, ''jhools'' (saddle cloth) and heavy jewellery. It is quite a treat to see female elephants wearing anklets, which tinkle as they walk. One can see people sprinkling 'gulaal' (coloured powder) perched on top of the elephant. The most beautifully decorated elephant is awarded. Elephant polo, Elephant race, the tug-of-war between Elephants and 19 men and women are the featured events of the festival. 
The elephants are also outfitted in ear danglers and brocade scarves to embellish their ears and necks. The [[Mahout]]s, who are known as the caretakers of the elephants, decorate the foreheads of the animals with head-plates as well as garnish their tusks with gold, silver bracelets and rings. Other events that take place during the festival include a polo match and a tug of war contest, where the strongest elephant is chosen to compete against a group of ten people.

Although the festival is primarily based on elephants, other animals such as camels and horses also participate in the elephant festival.

==History==

The Elephant Festival is considered one of the most popular and celebrated events in the city of Jaipur. Since the festival was introduced, the ceremony has managed to attract a variety of outsiders to the festive event. Elephants symbolize royalty according to the traditions of Rajasthan. The Elephant is also believed to be associated with [Buddhism] and [Jainism]. In fact, the elephant itself has a historical significance in Indian traditions. According to Indian Mythology, gods and the demons stirred the ocean, in the hopes that they would become eternal. Suddenly, nine jewels also known as the “navratnas” surfaced from the ocean. Of the nine jewels that reappeared, one of them was an elephant. Since then, the elephant has been regarded as a precious animal.

The state of Rajasthan was a popular destination for many royal figures as the kings and princes of those times would take elephant rides to the Amber Palace of Rajasthan. During the [monarchy], India’s royalty would hold events where the strongest elephants would fight each other to entertain the royal guests.
Nowadays, the festival is organized every year by the Rajasthan tourism group in the [[Chaugan Stadium]]. The venue was relocated to the Jaipur Polo Group grounds due to the festival’s increasing popularity.

==Controversy==

For its first time in many years, the elephant festival was cancelled for two consecutive years, 2012 and 2014, due to protest from the [Animal Welfare Board of India|Animal Welfare Board]. The animal activists were concerned about the chemical-laced colour being mocked down on the elephants and feared that the elephants would be harmed in the process. The Rajasthan tourism group, which hosts the festival every year failed to sign up the elephants with the Animal Welfare Board, and provide appropriate documents. As a result of this, the organizers decided to rename it as the “Holi Festival.” The Tourism Department’s decision to cancel comes in the wake of protests by [People for Ethical Treatment of Animals|People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)].

The '''1979 European elections''' were parliamentary elections held across all 9 (at the time) [[European Community]] [[European Union member state|member states]]. They were the first [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]] to be held, allowing citizens to elect 410 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] to the [[European Parliament]], and also the first international election in history.

Seats in the Parliament had been allocated to the states according to population, and in some cases were divided into [[European Parliament constituency|constituencies]], but members sat according to political groups.

==Background==
The [[Treaty of Rome]] which established the Communities specified that the [[European Parliament]] must be elected by [[universal suffrage]] using a common [[voting system]]. The [[Council of the European Union]] was responsible for setting up the elections but it had procrastinated. As a stop-gap measure, members were appointed to the Parliament by the member states from their own national parliaments, as they had done since the Common Assembly.&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"&gt;{{cite book| last = Hoskyns | first = Catherine |author2=Michael Newman | title = Democratizing the European Union: Issues for the twenty-first Century (Perspectives on Democratization | publisher = [[Manchester University Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-7190-5666-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliament was unhappy with this and threatened to take the Council to the [[European Court of Justice]]. The Council eventually agreed to elections and the first European Parliament elections were held in 1979 after proposals were put forward in the mid 1970s.&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PatijnReport"&gt;[http://aei.pitt.edu/1922/01/EP_election_decision.pdf Patijn Report]&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of a common voting method was left undecided, and even to this day the voting methods vary from member state to member state, although all have used some form of proportional representation since 1999.

==Campaigns==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F056098-0019, Nürnberg, SPD Europa-Wahlkampf, Schmidt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Helmut Schmidt]] on the campaign trail in 1979]]
The campaigns varied. The former [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]] [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|German Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]] took an international campaign to France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to boost the Socialist group. On the other hand, the former [[Prime Minister of France]] [[Jacques Chirac]] used the election to gauge his popularity against the then-[[President of France]] [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], in anticipation of a presidential bid in 1981.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946309,00.html Electing a New Parliament], [[Time Magazine]] 11 June 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election==
{{Politics of the European Union mini}}
In June, the 410 [[Member of the European Parliament|members]] were elected by universal suffrage. At the time there were no rules on the system of election to be used. The United Kingdom used a [[plurality voting system]] for multiple small constituencies in England, Wales and Scotland but the other member states used [[proportional representation]] for fewer larger constituencies (usually the member state itself as a single constituency), albeit with different methods of seat allocation.

The electorate took little interest&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt; but average [[voter turnout]] was 63%. The lowest turn out was in the United Kingdom with 32.2%: all others were above 50% apart from Denmark. Aside from Belgium and Luxembourg, where [[Compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]], the highest turnout was in Italy with 84.9%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/rates_of_participation_in_european_elections_1979_2009-en-7dc3cc1c-13f3-43a6-865f-8f17cf307ef7.html Rates of participation in European elections (1979–2004)] on CVCE website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final results==
Socialist parties working together under the Europe-wide [[Party of European Socialists|Confederation of Socialist Parties]] won the most seats: the resultant Socialist group had 113 MEPs. Christian Democrat parties united within the pan-European [[European People's Party]] came second, with the resultant group having 107 MEPs. The largest third force was the Conservative [[European Democrats]] with 64, followed by [[Party of the European Left|Communists]] with 44. The [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe|Liberal Democrats]] had 40 seats, although their candidate was elected as President.

The groups formed were loose coalitions based on the groups founded in previous years, but they soon became the basis for modern European political parties.

==Post election==
[[File:Simone Veil, gymnase Japy 2008 02 27 n5.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Simone Veil]], elected as the first female President]]
[[Louise Weiss]], who was 86 at the time, was found to be Parliament's oldest member and hence presided over the chamber while the election of the [[President of the European Parliament|President]] took place (July 1979). Before that could happen however, she immediately had to deal with [[Ian Paisley]] MEP who, in the first speech of the session, protested that the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|British flag]] outside the building was flying upside down.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Tempest and agencies [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/jan/19/northernireland.devolution Paisley to stand down as MEP], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 19 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; She dealt with the interruption swiftly. The confrontation was seen as one of her finest hours and she later confided that, as a grandmother, she was used to dealing with "recalcitrant youngsters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/a-number-of-names-worth-remembering-…/37506.aspx A number of names worth remembering ...], ''[[European Voice]]'', 26 November 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

There were five candidates for [[President of the European Parliament]]: [[Giorgio Amendola]], Italian [[Party of the European Left|Communist]]; [[Emma Bonino]], Italian [[European Free Alliance|Technical Independent]]; Christian de La Malène, French [[Union for Europe of the Nations|Progressive Democrat]]; [[Simone Veil]], French [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party|Liberal]], and Mario Zagari, Italian [[Party of European Socialists|Socialist]].&lt;ref name="Veil election"&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&amp;type=IM-PRESS&amp;reference=20070109BKG01804 Election of the President of the European Parliament], [[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first ballot, Veil secured 183 of the 380 votes cast – eight short of the absolute majority needed. The next closest contender was Zagari with 118 votes, then Amendola with 44, de la Malène with 26 and Bonino with 9. Bonino and de la Malène dropped out and Veil secured an absolute majority in the second ballot with 192 of the 377 votes cast (Zagari gained 128 and Amendola 47). Veil was elected as the first President of the elected Parliament, and first female President of the Parliament since it was founded in 1952.&lt;ref name="Veil election" /&gt;

The following were elected as Vice-Presidents: Danielle De March, [[Basil de Ferranti]], Bruno Friedrich, Guido Gonella, Gérard Jacquet, Hans Katzer, Poul Møller, [[Pierre Pflimlin]], [[Bríd Rodgers]], Marcel Albert Vandewiele, [[Anne Vondeling]] and [[Mario Zagari]].&lt;ref name="Veil election"/&gt;

Previously the Parliament was a weak consultative assembly, the members of which were part-time. With the elections the new body of [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] were full-time, energetic and more diverse. As soon as the Parliament was established the "old guard" MEPs of the larger parties sought to raise the bar at which a [[European Parliament political group]] could be formed (the status gave financial support and representation in committees). This move was quickly blocked by smaller groups working together and [[filibuster]]ing the proposal. The ties formed at this time laid the foundations of the [[Rainbow Group (1984–89)|Rainbow]] group: an alliance of left-wing and [[Green party|green]] parties&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"/&gt; which later became the [[European Greens–European Free Alliance]] group.

'''Fomivirsen''' (brand name '''Vitravene''') is an [[antisense therapy|antisense]] [[antiviral drug]] that was used in the treatment of [[cytomegalovirus retinitis]] (CMV) in [[immunocompromised]] patients, including those with [[AIDS]].  It was administered via intraocular injection.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-145153-6"&gt;{{cite book | author = Katzung, Bertram G. | title = Basic and Clinical Pharmacology | edition = 10th | language = | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division | location = New York | year = 2006 | origyear = | pages = 817 | quote = | isbn = 0-07-145153-6 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was discovered at the NIH and was licensed and initially [[drug development|developed]] by [[Ionis Pharmaceuticals|Isis Pharmaceuticals]], which subsequently licensed it to [[Novartis]].&lt;ref name=AJMC&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bubela|first1=Tania|last2=McCabe|first2=Christopher|title=Value-Engineered Translation: Developing Biotherapeutics That Align With Health-System Needs|url=http://www.ajmc.com/journals/evidence-based-diabetes-management/2014/july-august-2014/value-engineered-translation-developing-biotherapeutics-that-align-with-health-system-needs/p-2|work=American Journal of Managed Care|date=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was licensed by the FDA for CMV in Aug 1998, and was the first antisense drug that was approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jiang|first1=Kevin|title=Biotech comes to its ‘antisenses’ after hard-won drug approval : Spoonful of Medicine|url=http://blogs.nature.com/spoonful/2013/02/biotech-comes-to-its-antisenses-after-hard-won-drug-approval.html|work=Nature Medicine: Spoonful of Medicine Blog|date=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Novartis withdrew the marketing authorization in the EU in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Statement on Vitravene (fomiversen): Withdrawal of the Marketing Authorization in the European Union|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Public_statement/2009/12/WC500018346.pdf|publisher=EMA|date=August 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the US in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Initiating Coverage: Rexahn Pharmaceuticals (RNN)|url=http://www.baystreet.ca/articles/research_reports/lifesci/Rexahn052416.pdf|publisher=LifeSci Capital|date=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The drug was withdrawn because while there was a high unmet need for drugs to treat CMV when the drug was initially discovered and developed due to the CMV arising in people with [[AIDS]], the development of [[HAART]] dramatically reduced the number of cases of CMV.&lt;ref name=AJMC/&gt;

It is an [[antisense]] [[oligonucleotide]] -- a synthetic 21 member [[oligonucleotide]] with [[thiophosphate|phosphorothioate]] linkages (which are resistant to degradation by [[nuclease]]s) and has the sequence:

Further Future's membership is currently at 4000-5000 and is structured around a corporate retreat setting.  Further Future, located on the [[Moapa River Indian Reservation]], claims to offers an "all inclusive" festival experience, different than the, "vanish and leave no trace" principles instilled in those who participate in [[Burning Man]].  Further Future is the brainchild of a group called Robot Heart, an art and music collective known for the parties it throws during the annual Burning Man gathering in Northern Nevada's [[Black Rock Desert]].

[[File:GNC, Boston.JPG|thumb|[[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] displays its Global Message]]

'''Global Night Commute''' was a worldwide event organized by the makers of the film ''[[Invisible Children]]'' through the organization [[Invisible Children, Inc.]] It took place on April 29, 2006. Youths from around the world walked to city centers and spent the night in parks to show support for [[Ugandan]] children who walk every night into city centers attempting to avoid capture by the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA).

== Overview ==
These children, between the ages of 3 and 17, from [[Acholiland]] in Northern Uganda, are referred to as "night commuters". They walk up to 20&amp;nbsp;km (12&amp;nbsp;mi) from [[internally displaced person]] camps to larger towns, notably [[Gulu]], in search of safety from the LRA.

The Global Night Commute was similar to other initiatives raising awareness about the plight of the children in Acholiland like the [[Gulu Walk]] that took place in over 40 cities internationally in October 2005; however, the Global Night Commute took place on a much larger scale. Over 58,000 people signed up to participate in the event, but over 80,000 attended in total; it took place in 130 cities in seven countries.&lt;ref name=gnc&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Night Commute |url=http://www.invisiblechildren.com/theMovement/globalNightCommute/ |accessdate=2006-04-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425060858/http://www.invisiblechildren.com/theMovement/globalNightCommute/ |archivedate=2006-04-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the event was to raise awareness and ultimately end Africa's longest running conflict by facilitating a change in the policies of the United States government.  The slogan for the event is "On April 29th, we gathered. To make a difference. To end a war."

'''Indirect parliamentary elections''' were held in [[Guinea-Bissau]] on 31 March 1984. At the time, the country was a [[one-party state]] with the [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] as the sole legal party. The Assembly elected [[João Bernardo Vieira]] to the post of President on 16 May 1984.&lt;ref name=AED&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/gw.html Elections in Guinea-Bissau] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral system==

The '''Hult Prize''' was established in 2010 by Ahmad Ashkar and [[Bertil Hult]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/bertil-hult/ | publisher=Forbes | title=Profile - Bertil Hult}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an annual, year-long competition that crowd-sources ideas from MBA and college students after challenging them to solve a pressing social issue around topics such as food security, water access, energy, and education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-littman/milliondollar-hunger-real_b_2814157.html Million dollar hunger reality show: The Hult Prize], Huffington Post, 3/7/2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Hult family – founders of EF Education First – donates USD 1 million in seed capital to help the winning team launch a social enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/02/03/founder-bertil-hult-sees-education-first-breaking-down-global-barriers/KK6hpFwDqvocR73w0Xf9jO/story.html Education First aims to bridge barriers with exchange], Boston Globe, 2/4/2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Prize is a partnership between [[Hult International Business School]] and the [[United Nations Foundation]]. [[Bill Clinton]] selects the challenge topic and announces the winner each September;{{cn|date=September 2018}} he mentioned it in a 2012 ''[[TIME Magazine]]'' article about "the top 5 ideas that are changing the world for the better".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2125031-6,00.html The case for optimism], TIME Magazine, 10/1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Ahmad Ashkar left the banking industry during the economic downturn to pursue an MBA at [[Hult International Business School]].&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/video/creating-the-next-wave-of-social-entrepreneurs-mKQuhLy4QHSokxb1~JOEcQ.html Creating the next wave of social entrepreneurs], Ahmad Ashkar appearance on Bloomberg TV’s Taking Stock with Pimm Fox, 5/30/2013&lt;/ref&gt; A lecture given by [[One Laptop Per Child]] director Chuck Kane introduced Ashkar to the concept of social entrepreneurship and sparked his idea for the Hult Prize (originally called the Hult Global Case Challenge).&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt; In 2013, the Prize attracted more than 10,000 MBA and undergraduate applicants.&lt;ref&gt;http://video.foxnews.com/v/2421703863001/, Ahmad Ashkar appearance on Fox News, 5/30/2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''infringement Festival''' is an international, interdisciplinary critical arts festival that features [[theatre]], [[music]], [[film]], [[culture jamming]], [[Street theatre|street performance]] and [[visual arts]], with an emphasis on activist art and work that challenges the [[commodification]] of culture.

Conceptualized by theatre activist [[Donovan King]], the festival was founded in [[Montreal]] in 2004 by King and fellow theatre activists [[Jason C. McLean]] and Gary St-Laurent as a response to high registration fees and conflict-of-interest sponsorships in the [[St-Ambroise Montreal Fringe Festival]] and the trademarking of the word "Fringe" by the Canadian Association of Fringe Festivals.

It has since spread to [[Ottawa]], [[Toronto]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Brooklyn]] and [[Bordeaux, France|Bordeaux]].  Plans are also underway for possible events in [[Lockport, NY]], [[Hamilton, Ontario]] and [[Barcelona]].

The festival's mandate insists on no registration fees for participating artists, no ticket surcharge and only ethical sponsors that pose no conflict of interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6990">The '''Interactive Fiction Competition''' (also known as IFComp) is one of several annual competitions for works of [[interactive fiction]]. It has been held since 1995. It is intended for fairly short games, as judges are only allowed to spend two hours playing a game before deciding how many points to award it. The competition has been described as the "[[Super Bowl]]" of interactive fiction.&lt;ref name="wsj-20051115"/&gt;

== Organization ==
The competition is organized by ''Stephen Granade''.&lt;ref name="wiredfilm-20060817"/&gt; Although the first competition had separate sections for [[Inform]] and [[TADS]] games, subsequent competitions have not been divided into sections and are open to games produced by any method, provided that the software used to play the game is freely available. Anyone can judge the games, and anyone can donate a prize. Almost always, there are enough prizes donated that anyone who enters will get one. Entries are required to be released as [[freeware]] or [[public domain]], reflecting the general non-profit ethos of the IF community.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

In addition to the main competition, the entries take part in the Miss Congeniality contest, where the participating authors vote for three games (not including their own). This was started in 1998 to distribute that year's surplus prizes; this additional contest has remained unchanged since then, even without the original reason for its existence.

In 2016, operation of the competition was taken over by the [https://iftechfoundation.org/ Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation].&lt;ref name="gamasutra-20160630"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rockpapershotgun-20161207"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rockpapershotgun-20170703"/&gt;

The competition differs from the [[XYZZY Awards]], as authors must specifically submit games to the Interactive Fiction Competition, but all games released in the past year are eligible for the XYZZY Awards. Many games win awards in both competitions.

== Reception ==
A reviewer for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said of the 2008 competition, "Once again, the IF Competition delivers some of the best writing in games."&lt;ref name="avclub-20081222"/&gt; The 2008 competition was described as containing "some real standouts both in quality of puzzles and a willingness to stretch the definition of text adventures/interactive fiction."&lt;ref name="kotaku-20081117"/&gt;

{{Donald Trump series}}

This is a list of &lt;!-- "notable" persons only, as defined by the Wikipedia Manual of Style. --&gt; '''Anti-Trump''' or '''Never Trump Republicans''' and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] who announced their opposition to the election of [[Donald Trump]], the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 Republican Party nominee]] and eventual winner of the election, as the [[President of the United States]]. It also includes former Republicans who left the party due to their opposition to Trump and as well as Republicans who endorsed a different candidate. It does not include Republicans who opposed Trump during the [[primary election]] campaign but never announced opposition to Trump as the nominee. Some of the Republicans on this list threw their support to Trump after he won the presidential election, while many of them continue to oppose Trump.

Research on the Never Trump movement shows that [[Mormon]] and female Republicans were the most likely groups to oppose Trump's candidacy while non-Mormon and male Republicans were the most supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Lauren R. |last2=McCray |first2=Deon |last3=Ragusa |first3=Jordan M. |date=January 11, 2018 |title=#NeverTrump: Why Republican members of Congress refused to support their party’s nominee in the 2016 presidential election |url=https://doi.org/10.1177/2053168017749383 |journal=Research &amp; Politics |language=en |volume=5 |issue=1 |doi=10.1177/2053168017749383}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same study, establishment Republicans were found to be more likely to support Trump's candidacy, the opposite of what most observers, including Donald Trump himself, claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://time.com/4526492/donald-trump-paul-ryan-shackles/ |title=Trump Says He's Taking 'Shackles Off' His Campaign |website=Time|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is an '''incomplete list of industrial music festivals,''' which encapsulates [[music festivals]] focused on [[industrial music]]. The list may have some overlap with [[list of electronic music festivals]], [[list of gothic festivals]], and [[list of heavy metal festivals]]. Industrial music is a genre of [[experimental music]] that draws on transgressive and provocative themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s,&lt;ref&gt;"... journalists now use 'industrial' as a term like they would 'blues.'"—Genesis P-Orridge, ''RE/Search'' #6/7, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  and precursors included acts such as [[electronic music|electronic]] group [[Kraftwerk]], [[experimental rock]] acts such as [[The Velvet Underground]] and [[Frank Zappa]], [[psychedelic rock]] artists such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], and composers such as [[John Cage]]. [[AllMusic]] defines industrial as the "most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music"; "initially a blend of avant-garde electronics experiments (tape music, [[musique concrète]], white noise, synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) and [[punk rock|punk]] provocation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d141|pure_url=yes}}|title=Industrial|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=October 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable hybrid genres are [[industrial rock]] from the late 1970s and [[industrial metal]] from the 1980s, while [[electro-industrial]] developed in the late 1980s. Because of its genre fluidity, industrial music may be featured at [[rock festivals]], [[heavy metal festivals]], [[goth festivals]], and [[electronic music festivals]], though there are also festivals dedicated solely to industrial music. In North America in particular, electro-industrial music is often termed [[industrial dance]], and since the late 1980s industrial music festivals often attract industrial fans termed [[rivethead]]s or [[cybergoths]],&lt;ref name="cyber"&gt;{{cite book | title=ECO-TEC: Architecture of the In-Between - | publisher=Princeton Architectural Press | author=Marras, Amerigo | year=1999 | pages=54 | isbn=1568981597}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other countercultures such as [[cyberpunk]] and [[goth]] appearing as well. Cybergoth dance styles include [[rave dance|rave dance styles]], while more rock-focused festivals may feature dance styles such as [[pogo (dance)|pogoing]], [[headbanging]], and [[moshing]]. The rivethead dress code that emerged in the late 1980s&lt;ref name=steele&gt;Steele, Valerie (2008). Gothic: Dark Glamour. Yale University Press. p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; is [[militaristic]] with hints of [[Punk fashion|punk aesthetics]] and [[fetish fashion]],&lt;ref name="undead69"&gt;Lauren M. E. Goodlad, Michael Bibby: ''Goth. Undead subculture'', Duke University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0822339212}}, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; while cybergoth fashion from the late 1990s combines rivethead industrial aesthetics with a style associated with "gravers" (gothic ravers).&lt;ref name=steele/&gt;

The '''Lone Pine Film Festival''' is an annual film festival held in [[Lone Pine, California]], which celebrates the hundreds of films and television episodes that used Lone Pine, the [[Alabama Hills]], and the nearby [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range as film locations. Since the early years of filmmaking, directors and their production units have used the Lone Pine area to represent the iconic [[Western United States|American West]]. Since ''The Roundup'' (1920), the first documented film produced in the area, Lone Pine has played host to hundreds of the industry's best known directors and actors, among them directors [[William Wyler]], [[John Ford]], [[George Stevens]], and [[William Wellman]], and actors [[John Wayne]], [[Gene Autry]], [[Roy Rogers]], [[Bing Crosby]], and [[Barbara Stanwyck]]. The festival at Lone Pine was held for the first time in 1990, then called the Sierra Film Festival. In 2014, the festival celebrates its twenty-fifth silver anniversary.&lt;ref name="lpff-25"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lone Pine Film Festival Celebrates 25 Years |publisher=Lone Pine Flm Festival |date=August 4, 2014 |url=http://www.lonepinefilmfestival.org/index.php/component/content/article/429 |accessdate=August 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812210451/http://www.lonepinefilmfestival.org/index.php/component/content/article/429 |archivedate=August 12, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Held annually over the [[Columbus Day]] weekend, the Lone Pine Film Festival is one of the most important Western film festivals in the United States.&lt;ref name="american-cowboy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Herrera |first=Nathalie |title=The List: Western film festivals |publisher=American Cowboy |date= |url=http://www.americancowboy.com/travel/rodeo/list-western-film-festivals |accessdate=August 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Lone Pine area was first used as a film location in 1920, when a movie production company came to the [[Alabama Hills]] to make the silent film ''[[The Round-Up (1920 film)|The Round-Up]]''.&lt;ref name="lpcc-film"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Film Industry in the Lone Pine Area |publisher=Lone Pine Chamber of Commerce |url=http://lonepinechamber.org/history/the-film-industry-in-the-lone-pine-area/ |accessdate=August 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies soon discovered the scenic location, and in the coming decades, over 400 films, 100 television episodes, and countless commercials used Lone Pine and the Alabama Hills as a film location.&lt;ref name="lpcc-film"/&gt; Some of the notable films shot here in the 1920s and 1930s include ''[[Riders of the Purple Sage (1925 film)|Riders of the Purple Sage]]'' (1925) with [[Tom Mix]], ''The Enchanted Hill'' (1926) with [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]], ''Somewhere in Sonora'' (1927) with [[Ken Maynard]], ''[[Blue Steel (1934 film)|Blue Steel]]'' (1934) with [[John Wayne]], ''[[Hop-Along Cassidy]]'' (1935) with [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]], ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936 film)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' (1936) with Errol Flynn, ''[[Oh, Susanna! (1936 film)|Oh, Susanna!]]'' (1936) with [[Gene Autry]], ''[[Rhythm on the Range]]'' (1936) with [[Bing Crosby]], ''[[The Cowboy and the Lady (1938 film)|The Cowboy and the Lady]]'' (1938) with [[Gary Cooper]], ''[[Under Western Stars]]'' (1938) with [[Roy Rogers]], and ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'' (1939) with [[Cary Grant]].

In the coming decades, Lone Pine and the Alabama Hills continued to be used as the setting for Western films, including ''[[West of the Pecos (1945 film)|West of the Pecos]]'' (1945) with [[Robert Mitchum]], ''[[Thunder Mountain (1947 film)|Thunder Mountain]]'' (1947) with [[Tim Holt]], ''[[The Gunfighter]]'' (1950) with [[Gregory Peck]], ''[[The Nevadan]]'' (1950) with [[Randolph Scott]], ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'' (1955) with [[Spencer Tracy]], ''[[Hell Bent for Leather (film)|Hell Bent for Leather]]'' (1960) with [[Audie Murphy]], ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962) with [[James Stewart]], ''[[Nevada Smith]]'' (1966) with [[Steve McQueen]], ''[[Joe Kidd]]'' (1972) with [[Clint Eastwood]], ''[[Maverick (film)|Maverick]]'' (1994) with [[Mel Gibson]], and ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (2013) with [[Johnny Depp]]. Through the years, non-Western films also used the unique landscape of the area, including [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942) with [[Robert Cummings]], ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (1949) with [[Hedy Lamarr]], ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' (1989) with [[William Shatner]], ''[[Tremors (film)|Tremors]]'' (1990) with [[Kevin Bacon]], ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' (1997) with [[Kevin Costner]], and ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (2000) with [[Russell Crowe]].

In 1989, Lone Pine business and community leaders developed a plan to celebrate the film industry's heritage of using Lone Pine and the surrounding area as film locations to represent the iconic [[Western United States|American West]].&lt;ref name="lpff-25"/&gt; They invited numerous actors, directors, and producers who made films in the area throughout the years. The first film festival in Lone Pine was held on October 6 and 7 and was called the Sierra Film Festival.&lt;ref name="lpff-25"/&gt; Co-sponsored by a number of individuals and businesses, that first festival included numerous Western film celebrities, including [[Roy Rogers]], [[Richard Farnsworth]], [[Rand Brooks]], [[Pierce Lyden]], Loren Janes, [[William Witney]], and former stuntman Joe Yrigoyen.&lt;ref name="lpff-25"/&gt; The festival acknowledging its "deep appreciation and great gratitude" to Roy Rogers, who made his first film in Lone Pine in 1938 with ''[[Under Western Stars]]''. Rogers dedicated an historical stone marker placed at Whitney Portal and Movie Road during the festival.&lt;ref name="lpff-25"/&gt; The bronze plaque on the stone reads: "Sierra Film Festival, 70 years of Movie History, October 6 &amp; 7, 1990, Movie Flats – Lone Pine".&lt;ref name="lpff-25"/&gt;

The murder of '''Jeanne Clery''' occurred in 1986, in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] at [[Lehigh University]]. Clery, who was a student at the time of her death, was killed in her campus [[dormitory]]. Clery's parents, who believed the University had failed to share vital information with its students regarding campus safety, campaigned for legislative reform for several years following their daughter's death. Their sustained efforts ultimately resulted in the passage of the [[Clery Act]], a federal law requiring all universities and colleges receiving federal [[Student financial aid (United States)|student financial aid]] programs to report crime statistics, alert campus of imminent dangers, and distribute an Annual Campus Security Report to current and prospective students and employees.

Since the act's passage in 1990, numerous institutions have been found noncompliant and significantly fined. From 2008–2012, 14 higher education institutions were fined for Clery Act noncompliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://educationlaw.ncbar.org/newsletters/educationlawnov2013/clery | title=The Clery Act: Costs of Noncompliance | accessdate=July 15, 2017 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531124809/http://educationlaw.ncbar.org/newsletters/educationlawnov2013/clery | archivedate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large scale Clery violations resulted in financial fines at institutions such as [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[Eastern Michigan University]] and [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]].

==Incident==
On April 5, 1986, Jeanne Clery was raped and murdered in Stoughton Hall at Lehigh University by Josoph M. Henry, who was also a student. Clery was awoken by Henry in the process of robbing her, and Henry then beat, cut, raped, sodomized, and strangled Jeanne.&lt;ref name="LA Times 1989 Article Detailing Clery's Death"&gt;{{cite news|last1=BEYETTE|first1=BEVERLY|title=Campus Crime Crusade : Howard and Connie Clery Lost Their Daughter to a Crazed Thief; NoThey're Angry and Fighting Back|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-10/news/vw-301_1_campus-crime-statistics|accessdate=22 February 2015|publisher=LA Times|date=August 10, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross |first=Ken |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116872,00.html |title=After Their Daughter Is Murdered at College, Her Grieving Parents Mount a Crusade for Campus Safety |publisher=People.com |date=February 19, 1990 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Jeanne's death, there were reports that her dorm had had 181 situations of auto-locking doors being propped open by residents. The propped doors, as well as Clery's own room door left unlocked (for her roommate, who forgot her key) are believed to be how Henry entered Stoughton Hall.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} He was reported to the police after confessing the murder to his friends and was subsequently apprehended.&lt;ref name="pasupct1997"&gt;{{cite web | title=Com. v.

===Insufficient public warnings regarding criminal activity on campus===
As Connie and Howard Clery learned more about their daughter's death, they grew convinced that their daughter had died because of "slipshod" security on campus. Beyond this, they believed the university had "a rapidly escalating crime rate, which they didn't tell anybody about". At the time, Lehigh University's vice president John Smeaton, denied claims saying security measures were "more than adequate, reasonable and appropriate for our setting and our situation. You can't prevent everything from happening."&lt;ref name="LA Times 1989 Article Detailing Clery's Death"/&gt; Nonetheless, the Clery family believed that campus crime statistics had been significantly underreported, and led to Clery's parents founding the nonprofit organization Security On Campus, Inc. Today the foundation is called the Clery Center for Security On Campus.&lt;ref name="Clery Center for Campus Security"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://clerycenter.org/our-history|website=Clery Center for Campus Security|publisher=Clery Center for Campus Security|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securityoncampus.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=271&amp;Itemid=60 |title=Complying With The Jeanne Clery Act |publisher=Securityoncampus.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rd.com/family/ranking-the-safest-and-worst-college-campuses/ | title=Ranking the Safest (and Least Secure) College Campuses|work=Readers Digest |year=2008 |accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act or 'Clery Act' is a federal [[statute]] codified at {{uscsub|20|1092|f}}, implementing regulations in the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Code of Federal Regulations]] at {{USCFR|34|668|46}}. The Clery Act, signed in 1990, was originally known as the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act.

===Requirements===
The Clery Act requires all colleges and universities that participate in federal [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] programs to keep and disclose information about crime on and near their respective campuses. Compliance is monitored by the [[United States Department of Education]], which can impose [[civil penalties]], up to $56,906 per violation, against institutions for each infraction and can suspend institutions from participating in federal student financial aid programs.

Each year, institutions must publish and distribute their Annual Campus Security Report to current and prospective students and employees. This report is required to provide crime statistics for the prior three years, policy statements regarding various safety and security measures, campus crime prevention program descriptions, and procedures to be followed in the investigation and prosecution of alleged sex offenses.

Beyond this, universities are required to provide a Crime log, timely warnings to students, and crime statistics. The institution's police department or security departments are required to maintain a public log of all crimes reported to them, or those of which they are made aware. The Clery Act requires institutions to give timely warnings of crimes that represent a threat to the safety of students or employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clerycenter.org/clery-act-compliance|title=Clery Act Compliance|publisher=Clery Center for Security On Campus|accessdate=2013-09-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927061819/http://clerycenter.org/clery-act-compliance|archivedate=2013-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions are required to report on crimes such as: [[Murder]], [[Rape]], [[dating violence]], [[Robbery]], [[Arrest]], [[Hate crimes]] and disciplinary actions by the institution.

===Violations===
Since its founding, major incidents where universities were found in violation of the Clery act include Eastern Michigan University and the [[Murder of Laura Dickinson]], the [[Penn State sex abuse scandal]], and [[Virginia Tech shooting]] which received major media coverage.

}}
'''Robert Lee Yates Jr.''' (born May 27, 1952) is an American [[serial killer]] from [[Spokane, Washington]]. From 1996 to 1998, Yates is known to have murdered at least 13 women, all of whom were [[prostitutes]] working on E. Sprague Avenue, in Spokane. Yates also confessed to two murders committed in [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]] in 1975 and a 1988 murder committed in [[Skagit County, Washington|Skagit County]]. In 2002, Yates was convicted of killing two women in [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]] and sentenced to death, but his death sentences were commuted to life without parole after Washington State outlawed the death penalty in 2018. He is currently serving life in prison at the [[Washington State Penitentiary]].

==Early life==
Yates grew up in [[Oak Harbor, Washington]]&lt;ref name="karisable"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.karisable.com/skazyates.htm |title=Serial Killer Robert Yates |last=Sable Burns |first=Kari |publisher=www.karisable.com |accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a middle-class family that attended a local [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] church. He graduated from [[Oak Harbor High School (Washington)|Oak Harbor High School]] in 1970, and in 1975, he was hired by the Washington State Department of Corrections to work as a correction officer at the [[Washington State Penitentiary]] in Walla Walla. In October 1977 Yates enlisted in the [[United States Army]], in which he became certified to fly civilian transport airplanes and helicopters. Yates was stationed in various countries outside the continental United States, including [[Germany]] and later [[Somalia]] and Haiti during the United Nations peacekeeping missions of the 1990s. He earned several military awards and medals during his eighteen and a half year military career, including three [[Army Achievement Medal]]s, three [[Army Commendation Medal]]s, two [[Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal]]s, and three [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Meritorious Service Medal]]s. Yates left the Army in April 1996, apparently a year and a half short of being eligible for his full retirement benefits and pension. At this time the military was reducing its numbers so he got his full retirement despite being short of the customary 20 years served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/yates/guy_8.html |title=Robert Lee Yates was the Spokane serial killer |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |page= 8 |accessdate=May 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
The murders Yates committed between 1988 and 1998 in Spokane all involved prostitutes working along Spokane's E. Sprague Avenue. The victims were initially solicited for prostitution by Yates, who would have sex with them (often in his 1979 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] van), sometimes do drugs with them, then kill them and dump their bodies in rural locations. All of his victims died of gunshot wounds to the head; eight of the murders were committed with a [[Raven Arms MP-25|Raven .25-caliber]] [[handgun]], and one [[attempted murder]] was linked to the same model of handgun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.francesfarmersrevenge.com/stuff/serialkillers/yates.htm |title=Serial Killer Robert Lee Yates Jr |publisher=www.francesfarmersrevenge.com |accessdate=May 15, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422025822/http://www.francesfarmersrevenge.com/stuff/serialkillers/yates.htm |archivedate=April 22, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autopsies of two of the victims indicated that the killer was a marksman aiming for the heart.&lt;ref&gt;[[Burl Barer|Barer, Burl]] (2012). ''[[Body Count (book)|Body Count]]'' New York: Kensington Books.&lt;/ref&gt; One particularly bizarre detail of Yates' murders involved the case of Melody Murfin, whose body was buried just outside the bedroom window of Yates' family home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/yates/up_11.html |title=Robert Lee Yates was the Spokane serial killer |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |page=11 |accessdate=May 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601204540/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/yates/up_11.html |archive-date=2009-06-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 1998, Yates picked up prostitute Christine Smith, who managed to escape after being shot, assaulted and robbed.&lt;ref name="Aamodt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Psyc%20405/serial%20killers/Yates,%20Robert%20Lee.htm |title=Robert Lee Yates  |accessdate=May 15, 2009}}{{rs?|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 19, 1998, Yates was asked to give a [[DNA]] sample to Spokane police after being stopped; he refused, stating that it was too extreme of a request for a "family man".&lt;ref name="Aamodt" /&gt;

==Convictions and appeals==
Yates was arrested on April 18, 2000, for the murder of Jennifer Joseph.&lt;ref name="Aamodt" /&gt; After his arrest a search warrant was executed on a 1977 white Corvette that he had previously owned. A white Corvette had been identified as the vehicle that one of the victims had last been seen in. Coincidentally, Yates had been pulled over in this vehicle while the Task Force was searching for it, but the field interview report was misread as saying "Camaro" not "Corvette", thus the incident was not realized until after Yates had been arrested. After searching the Corvette, police discovered blood that they linked to Jennifer Joseph and DNA from Yates that they then tied to 12 other victims.&lt;ref&gt;Fuhrman, Mark (2001). '' Murder in Spokane '' New York: Harper Collins.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 he was charged with 13 counts of [[first-degree murder]] and one count of attempted first-degree murder in Spokane County Superior Court.&lt;ref name="karisable" /&gt; As part of a plea bargain in which Yates confessed to the murders to avoid the [[death penalty]], he was sentenced to 408 years in prison.&lt;ref name="abcnews"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/serialkillers010112.html  |title=Wash. Prosecutors Seek Death Penalty for Serial Killer |publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=May 15, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010421083705/http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/serialkillers010112.html |archivedate = April 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Yates was charged in [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]] with the murders of two additional women. The prosecution sought the [[death penalty]] for the deaths of Melinda L. Mercer in 1997 and Connie Ellis in 1998, which were thought to be linked to the killings in Spokane County.&lt;ref name="abcnews" /&gt; On September 19, 2002, Yates was convicted of those murders and subsequently [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by [[lethal injection]] on October 3, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=webyates03&amp;date=20021003&amp;query=%22Robert+Lee+Yates%22 |title=Serial killer Yates sentenced to death| date=October 3, 2002 |work=[[Seattle Times]]|accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2002 death sentence was appealed on grounds that Yates believed his 2000 plea bargain to be "all-encompassing", and that a life sentence for 13 murders and a death sentence for two constituted "disproportionate, freakish, wanton and random" application of the death penalty.  The arguments were rejected in 2007 by the [[Washington Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;State high court upholds death penalty for Yates (September 28, 2007).

Retrieved September 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A September 19, 2008 execution date was [[stay of execution|stayed]] by Chief Justice [[Gerry L. Alexander]] pending additional appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.king5.com/localnews/stories/NW_091108WAB_yates_execution_stayed_TP.68d9d3a3.html?npc | title=Court stays execution for serial killer Yates | publisher=[[KING-TV]] | date=September 11, 2008 | accessdate=September 18, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Yates's attorneys filed a ''[[habeas corpus]]'' petition in federal district court, stating that Yates is mentally ill and, "through no fault of his own ... suffers from a severe [[paraphilic]] disorder" that predisposed him to commit murder.  The still-pending motion is regarded as a "long shot" by most observers.  "I don't think Mr. Yates helps his cause by relying on the fact that he's a [[necrophiliac]]," said Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist.&lt;ref&gt;Serial killer Robert Yates Jr. seeks federal appeal of death sentence (May 16, 2013).

Yates remains incarcerated at the [[Washington State Penitentiary]].&lt;ref name="karisable" /&gt;  His case has been further complicated by Washington Governor [[Jay Inslee]]'s 2013 declaration that he would not sign death warrants for anyone on death row while he is in office.  Inslee cited the high cost of the appeals process, the randomness with which death sentences are sought, and a lack of evidence that the penalty serves as a deterrent to other criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inslee halts executions in state while he is governor|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2022883256_deathpenaltyinsleexml.html|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=February 11, 2014|accessdate=2014-02-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212015914/http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2022883256_deathpenaltyinsleexml.html|archivedate=February 12, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington state to suspend death penalty by governor's moratorium|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/11/washington-state-death-penalty-governor-inslee-suspends|newspaper=The Guardian|date=February 11, 2014|accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, the Washington Supreme Court once again rejected an effort by Yates to overturn his conviction and death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Supreme Court rejects serial killer Yates' petition to overturn death sentence|url=http://q13fox.com/2015/07/09/supreme-court-rejects-serial-killer-yates-petition-to-overturn-death-sentence/ | publisher=Q13FOX | date=July 9, 2015 | accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After the Washington State Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that the death penalty violated the state constitution, Yates's death sentence, as well as that of Washington's other death row inmates, was commuted to life in prison without the possibility of parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/list-of-inmates-whose-sentences-are-changed-from-death-row-to-life-in-prison/|title=List of inmates whose sentences are changed from death row to life in prison |publisher=The Seattle Times|date=October 11, 2018|accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Israel-Palestinian peace process}}
The '''Sharm El Sheikh Memorandum''', full name: '''The Sharm El Sheikh Memorandum on Implementation Timeline of Outstanding Commitments of Agreements Signed and the Resumption of Permanent Status Negotiations''' was a [[memorandum]] signed on September 4, 1999 by [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Ehud Barak]] and [[PLO]] Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] at [[Sharm el Sheikh]] in [[Egypt]], overseen by the [[United States]] represented by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Madeleine Albright]]. The memorandum was witnessed and co-signed by President [[Hosni Mubarak]] of Egypt and King [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah]] of [[Jordan]].

== Purposes ==

The memorandum's purpose was to implement the [[Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip]] (Oslo II) of September 1995 and to implement all other agreements between the PLO and Israel since September 1993: [[Protocol on Economic Relations]] (1994); [[Gaza–Jericho Agreement|Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area]] (1994); [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty|Washington Declaration]] (1994); [[Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities Between Israel and the PLO]] (1994); [[Protocol on Further Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities]] (1995); [[Wye River Memorandum]] (1998).

To sum up the memorandum:
:''In an effort to break the deadlocked Israel-PA negotiations, the parties met in Sharm El Sheikh in the presence of Secretary Albright, President Mubarak and King Abdullah, and signed an agreement which called for the Israeli withdrawal from a further 11% of the West Bank; the release of 350 Palestinian prisoners; the opening of safe passages between the West Bank and Gaza; and a seaport to be built in Gaza. There was also a timetable for final status talks to deal with Jerusalem, borders, refugees and settlements. A framework agreement on permanent status (FAPS) was to be achieved by February 2000 and permanent agreement by September 2000.'' [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/ses_speeches.html]

== Redeployments ==

The two sides agreed to resume Permanent Status negotiations to reach a Permanent Status Agreement. They reaffirmed that negotiations on the Permanent Status would lead to the implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Both sides agreed to make a determined effort to conclude a framework agreement and established a timetable to achieve this goal.
 
Israel and Palestine agreed on a number of Israeli redeployments.

(Note: Area A - Full control of the [[Palestinian Authority]].

Area B - Palestinian civil control, [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli military]] control.

Area C - Full Israeli control.)

# On September 5, 1999, to transfer 7% from Area C to Area B.

# On November 15, 1999, to transfer 2% from Area B to Area A and 3% from Area C to Area B.

# On January 20, 2000, to transfer 1% from Area C to Area A, and 5.1% from Area B to Area A.

== Other stipulations ==

* Various committees to monitor redeployments and the return to civilian life.
* Safe passage routes and crossing points.
* A high level Joint Liaison Committee, which would convene no later than September 13, 1999 to review the situation in the [[Tomb of the Patriarchs]] / ''Al Haram Al Ibrahimi''

The memorandum states that neither side would initiate or take any step that would change the status of the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] in accordance with the Interim Agreement. This clause recognized the necessity to create an appropriate environment for negotiations,

Israeli and Palestinian negotiators also discussed various issues:

* Needs for the peaceful and normal functioning of the [[Gaza City|Gaza]] sea port and airport.
* The release of [[Palestinian prisoners]] from Israeli military jails.
* Anti-terrorism security. Both sides affirmed they would act swiftly against any threat or act of [[terrorism]], violence or incitement, whether committed by Palestinians or Israelis.

Palestine and Israel also called upon the international donor community to enhance its financial support for the Palestinian economic development and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

The '''Spanish GT Championship / Iber GT''' (''Campeonato de España de GT / Iber GT'') was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[auto racing]] series founded in 1999 and organised by the GT Sport Organización.  The series runs multiple classes of [[grand tourer]] cars in events around Spain and [[Portugal]].  The series later formed the basis for the [[International GT Open]], a European-wide series which follows a similar structure.

==Format==
For racing events, Spanish GT has changed very little since its inception.  Each even consists of two races of equal distance, one run on Saturday and the other on Sunday.  Each race has its own qualifying session to determine the grid.  The races both count towards the points championship, effectively doubling the series schedule.

Initially, three classes of cars were used for the series, termed GT2, GT3, and GT4.  This was soon replaced by the GTA, GTB, and GTC classes.  These cars ranged from the [[FIA]]'s GT2 class equivalent down to cars from [[One-Design|one make]] series.  The slowest class, GTC, was eliminated in 2001, only to return in 2004.  A new GTS class was introduced in 2005, initially for the custom-built [[SEAT Toledo]] GT, but was adapted in 2006 to use cars from the [[FIA GT3 European Championship]], originally without scoring points in the first year.

In the current format, the GTA class is dominated by the [[Ferrari F430]] GT2, [[Porsche 911 GT3]]-RSR, [[Mosler MT900]]R, and the custom-built Sun Red SR21.  GTS uses GT3 versions of the Ferrari F430, Porsche 911, [[Lamborghini Gallardo]] and [[Dodge Viper]] Competition Coupe.  GTB is retained for one-make cup regulation versions of the F430 and 911, as well as the [[Marcos (automobile)|Marcos Mantis]].

The Spanish GT Championship shares several race weekends with the [[European F3 Open Championship]], also run by the GT Sport Organización.

==Champions==
An overall combined drivers championship is awarded each season, adding overall points to class points, which can mean a driver from a lower class of car can be crowned the series champion.  Along with this, each individual class also awards their own champion.

A '''steam rupture''' occurs within a pressurized system of super critical water when the pressure exceeds the design plus [[safety margin]] specification.  A steam rupture can occur in any elevated temperature pressurized system, including, but not limited to:  Automobile cooling systems, stationary power plants, mobile power plants, steam driven tools (such as some [[trip hammer]]s), and even the delivery systems for application processes such as cleaning and fabric fullering.

'''''The Captain from Köpenick''''', also known as '''''I Was a Criminal''''' and '''''Passport to Heaven''''', is a 1945 American comedy film directed by [[Richard Oswald]] and based upon the play ''[[The Captain of Köpenick (play)|The Captain of Köpenick]]'' by [[Carl Zuckmayer]] and [[Albright Joseph]]. The play was based on the true story of [[Wilhelm Voigt]], a German ex-convict who masqueraded as a [[Prussia]]n military officer in 1906 and became famous as the [[Wilhelm Voigt#Captain of K.C3.B6penick|Captain of Köpenick]].

''The Captain from Köpenick'' was Oswald's second film version of the story; the first was a 1931 German film also called ''[[The Captain from Köpenick (1931 film)|The Captain from Köpenick]]''. In the intervening years Oswald had fled [[Nazi Germany]] for France, then the United States; this was his first American film. It was completed in 1941, but due to difficulty finding a distributor, it was not released until 1945.

==Plot==
[[Image:Hauptmann Köpenick.JPG|thumb|A statue of Wilhelm Voigt as the Captain of Köpenick at Köpenick city hall]]
[[File:DPAG-20060902-HauptmannKoepenick.jpg|thumb|German postage stamp, 2006]]
Shoemaker Wilhelm Voigt is released from prison after many years of hard labor. His freedom is new to him and, as he tries to navigate this strange new world, he promptly finds himself in the midst of a Prussian [[Catch-22 (logic)|catch-22]]: To get a residence permit (passport), he must have a job, but he can only get a job if he has a residence permit. No one in the Prussian-German bureaucracy feels compelled to help him: everything must go by the book. Out of desperation, Voigt breaks into a police station to forge the much-needed permit and escape the vicious circle.

Unfortunately, Voigt is caught and again has to spend many more years behind bars. The prison's warden subjects the prisoners to the whims of his militarism. The warden loves everything military and has the prisoners re-enact famous battles. When Voigt is released, he still doesn't have his permit, but now he has a deep knowledge of military uniforms, military ranks and military speak that he can use to his advantage. In [[Berlin]] he buys and wears a used captain's uniform, then marches towards a platoon of soldiers standing guard and commands them to immediately follow him to [[Köpenick]], a suburb of Berlin. He is so convincing that they actually do! When they arrive, he has the soldiers stage a coup-like takeover of the Town Hall so he can commandeer his much sought-after permit, but is informed by the staff the permits are now only issued in Berlin. After he pockets all of the cash in the municipal treasury, he orders his soldiers to take the train back to their original posts in Berlin and then absconds with the cash.

When Voigt sees wanted posters offering a reward for the capture of the perpetrator of the [[Wilhelm Voigt#Captain of K.C3.B6penick|Koepenick Caper]], he goes to the Chief of Police, confesses and returns all the money. The police in the station all erupt in fits of laughter, offer him drinks and congratulate him for the best practical joke they have ever heard of. Voigt is now famous and even the Kaiser wants to hear his story.

==Production==
The [[American Film Institute]] quotes ''PM's Weekly'' as citing the budget at $350,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=27104|title=The Captain of Koepenick|work=[[American Film Institute]]|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Charleston Daily Mail'' reported that ''The Captain Of Koepenick'' is in production a second time, but although "[[Richard Oswald|Oswald]] is attempting to make the film exactly as before ... now none of his German comics can open their mouths without uttering something with a political meaning.  They say what they said in 1931, but their every utterance is fraught with ideals. Still, [[Albert Bassermann]] plays a captain in uniform magnificently. John Hall is producing the picture and it better be good.  Else John Hall, himself, in person, stands to lose a sizeable chunk of his money.  So do Messrs. Bassermann, Oswald, et al." ... "You may never see ''The Captain Of Koepenick'', but we hope it's good enough that you will. The manufacturers compose a brave crew."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=United Press|title=Famous Old German Tale Being Filmed|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/west-virginia/charleston/charleston-daily-mail/1941/10-26/page-22|accessdate=24 July 2014|publisher=The Charleston Daily Mail|date=October 26, 1941}} p. 22 (p. 8, col. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=United Press|title=Famous Old|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/west-virginia/charleston/charleston-daily-mail/1941/10-26/page-24|accessdate=24 July 2014|publisher=The Charleston Daily Mail|date=October 26, 1941}} p. 24 (p. 10, col. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
In his biography of Oswald, [[Kay Weniger]] recalled Oswald's problems with shooting good movies in Hollywood: "Of all his films, only his barely screened ''I Was a Criminal'' (the U.S. version of his ''The Captain from Köpenick''), with an excellent performance by [[Albert Bassermann]] in the leading role, is of any relevance. As U.S. audiences had a hard time relating to themes of Prussian militarism, subservience and lack of democracy, the film went without a distributior for many years and only premiered at the beginning of 1945".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weniger|first1=Kay|title=Es wird im Leben dir mehr genommen als gegeben ...|date=2011|publisher=ACABUS Verlag|location=Hamburg|isbn=9783862820498|page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Captain from Koepenick'' was screened at the Syracuse Cinefest on 14 March 2013 as ''Passport to Heaven''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140729004535/http://www.syracusecinefest.com/node/70 Syracuse Cinephile Society's Cinefest 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Jan Christopher Horak wrote: "The film is a remarkable achievement for the Director. The [[Architecture in Berlin|Berlin architecture]] was rendered via documentary footage and studio sets, and the camera uses movement through light and shadow to bring the symbols of power again and again into the picture: In one setting, shadows transform the omnipresent image of the emperor into a portrait of the [[Führer]]. Alas, the story of a simple shoemaker [...] up against the Prussian mentality of authoritarian militarism and bureaucratic obedience, the desperation of the permitless worker rejected over and over, all these were foreign to pre-war America in 1941. [...] Unlike Max Adalbert (1931) and Heinz Rühmann (1956) who played the shoemaker as the "little guy", ... [[Albert Bassermann|Bassermann]] is angry, always rebelling and defying the powers that be, channelling his own experience as a Nazi exile: A powerful performance, making this film perhaps the most German of all exile films.“&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horak|first1=Jan Christopher|title=Exilfilm, 1933–1945|url=http://www.filmportal.de/sites/default/files/Jan-Christopher-Horak_Exilfilm1933-1945.pdf|website=filmportal.de|accessdate=24 July 2014}}, p. 12, PDF, 158 KBy&lt;/ref&gt;

His hair is combed to the back.|Adrian Lim conned many women into offering him money and sex, and killed children in an attempt to stop police investigations against him.]]
The '''Toa Payoh ritual murders''' took place in [[Singapore]] in 1981.  On 25&amp;nbsp;January, the body of a nine-year-old girl was found in a bag next to the [[Elevator|lift]] of a block of [[Public housing in Singapore|flat]]s in the town of [[Toa Payoh]], and two weeks later, a ten-year-old boy was found dead nearby.  The children had been killed, purportedly as blood sacrifices to the Hindu goddess [[Kali]].  The murders were masterminded by Adrian Lim, a self-styled [[Mediumship|medium]], who had tricked scores of women into believing he had supernatural powers.  His victims offered money and sexual services in exchange for cures, beauty, and good fortune.  Two of the women became his loyal assistants; Tan Mui Choo married him, and Hoe Kah Hong became one of his "holy wives".  When the police investigated a [[rape]] charge filed by one of Lim's targets, he became furious and decided to kill children to derail the investigations.  On each occasion, Hoe lured a child to Lim's flat where he or she was drugged and killed by the trio.  Lim also sexually assaulted the girl before her death.  The trio were arrested after the police found a trail of blood that led to their flat.  Although the case name suggested ritualistic murders,&lt;ref&gt;Sit (1989), ''I Confess'', xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sit (1989), ''Was Adrian Lim Mad?'', xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; the defendants said they did not conduct prayers, burning of [[joss stick]]s, ringing of bells, or any other rituals during the killings.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 187, 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 41-day trial was the second longest to have been held in the courts of Singapore at the time.  None of the defendants denied their guilt.  Their appointed counsels tried to spare their clients the death sentence by pleading [[diminished responsibility]], arguing that the accused were mentally ill and could not be held entirely responsible for the killings.  To support their case they brought in doctors and psychologists, who analysed the defendants and concluded that they had exhibited [[schizophrenia]], and depressions of the [[Psychotic depression|psychotic]] and [[Hypomania|manic]] order. The prosecution's expert, however, refuted these testimonies and argued that they were in full control of their mental faculties when they planned and carried out the murders.  The judges agreed with the prosecution's case and sentenced the trio to death.  While on [[death row]], the women appealed to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] in London and pleaded for [[Pardon|clemency]] from the President of Singapore to no avail.  Lim did not seek any pardons; instead, he accepted his fate and went smiling to the gallows.  The three were [[Hanging|hanged]] on 25&amp;nbsp;November 1988.

The Toa Payoh ritual murders shocked the public in Singapore, who were surprised by such an act taking place in their society.  Reports of the trio's deeds and the court proceedings were closely followed and remained prominent in the Singaporean consciousness for several years.  Twice, movie companies tried to capitalise on the sensation generated by the murders by producing motion pictures based on the killings; however, critics panned both films for indulging in gratuitous sex and violence, and the movies performed poorly at the box office.  The actions and behaviour of the three killers were studied by academics in the criminal psychology field, and the rulings set by the courts became local case studies for diminished responsibility.

}}

Early in the nineteenth century, immigrants flooded into [[Peninsular Malaysia]], colonising the [[Straits Settlements]] including the island city of Singapore. Migrants and natives held differing beliefs, but over time the boundaries between those belief systems blurred. Most of the population believed in spirits that inhabit the jungles, and in gods and devils that hover around, capable of benevolence and mischief.  Certain people claimed that they could communicate with these supernatural beings.  Through rituals in which they danced and chanted, these [[Mediumship|spirit mediums]]&amp;mdash;''tang-kees'' and ''[[bomoh]]s''&amp;mdash;invited the beings to possess their bodies and dole out wisdoms, blessings, and curses to their believers.  As time passed and the cities grew, the jungles gave way to concrete structures and the mediums' practices moved deeper into the heartland of communities.&lt;ref&gt;DeBernadi (2006), 1&amp;ndash;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1980, 75% of the residents in Singapore were living in [[Public housing in Singapore|public housing]].&lt;ref&gt;Thung (1977), 229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Government-built high-rise blocks of flats clustered in the population centres, of which [[Toa Payoh]] was typical.  Although a high density of people lived in each block, the residents mostly kept to themselves, valuing their privacy and tending to ignore what was happening around their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Trocki (2006), 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thung (1977), 231&amp;ndash;232.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, Singapore was a relatively peaceful society&amp;mdash;a stark contrast to the prevalence of secret societies, [[Triad (underground society)|triads]] and gang warfare during the pre-independence days.  The low crime rate, brought on by strict laws and tough enforcement,&lt;ref&gt;Rowen (1998), 116&amp;ndash;117.&lt;/ref&gt; gave citizens a sense of security.&lt;ref&gt;Quah (1987), 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the government warned against complacency and lectured in its local campaigns, "Low crime doesn't mean no crime".&lt;ref&gt;Naren (2000), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1981, three Singaporeans committed a crime that shocked the nation.

== Two murders, three arrests ==
[[File:Toa Payoh Ritual Murders' Flat.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=High-rise buildings stand next to each other besides a road. An apartment unit of the block on the right is highlighted in red.|Lim's flat (highlighted in red) was in Block 12 (right), Toa Payoh Lorong 7. By 2008, the neighbouring Blocks 10 and 11 (centre and left) had been replaced with taller structures.]]
For several years, a medium in Block 12, Toa Payoh Lorong 7, had been performing noisy rituals in the middle of the night.  The residents complained several times to the authorities, but the rituals would always resume after a short time.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the afternoon of 24&amp;nbsp;January 1981, nine-year-old Agnes Ng Siew Heok ({{zh|s=黄秀叶|t=黃秀葉|p=Huáng Xìuyè}}) disappeared after attending religious classes at her church in Toa Payoh.  Hours later, her naked body was found stuffed in a bag outside a [[Elevator|lift]] in Block 11, less than a kilometre (five-eighths of a mile) from the church.  The girl had been smothered to death; the investigation revealed injuries to her genitals and semen in her rectum.  Although the police launched an intensive investigation, questioning more than 250&amp;nbsp;people around the crime scene, they failed to obtain any leads.  On 7&amp;nbsp;February ten-year-old Ghazali bin Marzuki was found dead under a tree between Blocks 10 and 11, naked.  He had been missing since the previous day, after being seen boarding a taxi with an unknown woman.  [[Forensic pathology|Forensic pathologists]] on the scene deemed the cause of death as drowning, and found on the boy suffocation marks similar to those on Ng.  There were no signs of sexual assault, but burns were on the boy's back and a puncture on his arm. Traces of a [[sedative]] were later detected in his blood.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The police found a scattered trail of blood that led to the seventh floor of Block 12.  Stepping into the common corridor from the stairwell, Inspector Pereira noticed an eclectic mix of religious symbols (a cross, a mirror, and a knife-blade) on the entrance of the first flat (unit number 467F).  The owner of the flat, Adrian Lim, approached the inspector and introduced himself, informing  Pereira that he was living there with his wife, Tan Mui Choo, and a girlfriend, Hoe Kah Hong.  Permitted by Lim to search his flat, the police found traces of blood.  Lim initially tried to pass the stains off as candle wax, but when challenged claimed they were chicken blood.&lt;ref&gt;Narayanan (1989), 166&amp;ndash;167.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the police  found slips of paper written with the dead children's personal details, Lim tried to allay suspicions by claiming that Ghazali had come to his flat seeking treatment for a bleeding nose.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 7&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;  He discreetly removed hair from under a carpet and tried to flush it down the toilet, but the police stopped him; forensics later determined the hair to be Ng's.&lt;ref&gt;Narayanan (1989), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Requesting a background check on Lim, Pereira received word from local officers that the medium was currently involved in a rape investigation.  Lim overheard them and became agitated, raising his voice at the law enforcers.  His ire was mimicked by Hoe as she gestured violently and shouted at the officers.  Their actions further raised the investigators' suspicions that the trio were deeply involved in the murders.  The police collected the evidence, sealed the flat as a crime scene, and took Lim and the two women in for questioning.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perpetrators ==

=== Adrian Lim ===
Born on 6&amp;nbsp;January 1942, Adrian Lim ({{zh|s=林宝龙|t=林寶龍|p=Lín Bǎolóng}}) was the eldest son of a low-income  family.&lt;ref name="john10"&gt;John (1989), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Described at the trial by his sister as a hot-tempered boy,&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 162.&lt;/ref&gt; he dropped out of secondary school and worked a short stint as an informant for the [[Internal Security Department]], joining the cable radio company [[Rediffusion Singapore]] in 1962.  For three years, he installed and serviced Rediffusion sets as an electrician before being promoted to bill collector.&lt;ref name="john10" /&gt;  In April 1967, Lim married his childhood sweetheart with whom he had two children.  He converted to Catholicism for his marriage.&lt;ref name="nara80"&gt;Narayanan (1989), 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lim and his family lived in rented rooms until his 1970 purchase of a three-room flat&amp;mdash;a seventh floor unit (unit number 467F) of Block 12, Toa Payoh.&lt;ref name="nara80" /&gt;

Lim started part-time practice as a spirit medium in 1973.  He rented a room where he attended to the women&amp;mdash;most of whom were [[bargirl]]s, dance hostesses, and prostitutes&amp;mdash;introduced to him by his landlord.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 17&amp;ndash;19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lim's customers also included superstitious men and elderly females, whom he cheated only of cash.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 18, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  He had learned the trade from a bomoh called "Uncle Willie" and prayed to gods of various religions despite his Catholic baptism.  The Hindu goddess [[Kali]] and "Phragann",{{refn|Lim used a small figurine of Phragann in his rituals, and wore it around his waist during sex.  The two main sources differed in their naming of this object.  John referred to it as Pragngan, while Narayanan cited the police reports, calling it Phragann.|group=fn}} which Lim described as a Siamese sex god,&lt;ref&gt;John, p.12&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt; were among the spiritual entities he called on in his rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Narayanan (1989), 86, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lim deceived his clients with several [[confidence trick]]s; his most effective gimmick, known as the "needles and egg" trick, duped many to believe that he had supernatural abilities.  After blackening needles with soot from a burning candle, Lim carefully inserted them into a raw egg and sealed the hole with powder.  In his rituals, he passed the egg several times over his client while chanting and asked her to crack open the egg.  Unaware that the egg had been tampered with, the client would be convinced by the sight of the black needles that evil spirits were harassing her.&lt;ref&gt;Narayanan (1989), 30&amp;ndash;31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim particularly preyed on gullible girls who had deep personal problems.  He promised them that he could solve their woes and increase their beauty through a ritual massage.  After Lim and his client had stripped, he would knead her body&amp;mdash;including her genitals&amp;mdash;with Phragann's idol and have sex with her.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 19&amp;ndash;20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lim's treatments also included an [[electro-shock therapy]] based on that used on mental patients.  After placing his client's feet in a tub of water and attaching wires to her temples, Lim passed electricity through her.&lt;ref&gt;Narayanan (1989), 46&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt;  The shocks, he assured her, would cure headaches and drive away evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Kok (1990), 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tan Mui Choo ===
[[File:Tan Mui Choo.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Mugshot of a woman: she has a slim, oval face, and her hair is dishevelled.|Tan Mui Choo assisted Lim in his medium practice, reaping the benefits.]]

Catherine Tan Mui Choo ({{zh|s=陈梅珠|t=陳梅珠|p=Chén Méizhū}}) was referred to Lim by a fellow bargirl, who claimed the spirit medium could cure ailments and depression.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tan, at that time, was grieving the death of her grandmother to whom she had been devoted.  Furthermore, her estrangement from her parents weighed on her mind; having been sent away at the age of 13 to a vocational centre (a home mostly for [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile delinquents]]), she felt unwanted by them.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 26&amp;ndash;27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tan's visits to Lim became regular, and their relationship grew intimate.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 29&amp;ndash;31.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975 she moved into his flat on his insistence.  To allay his wife's suspicions that he was having an affair with Tan, Lim swore an oath of denial before a picture of Jesus Christ.  However, she discovered the truth and moved out with their children a few days later, divorcing Lim in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Narayanan (1989), 113&amp;ndash;114.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lim quit his Rediffusion job and became a full-time medium.  He enjoyed brisk business,&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 33&amp;ndash;35.&lt;/ref&gt; at one point receiving [[Singapore dollar|S$]]6,000&amp;ndash;7,000 ([[US dollar|US$]]2,838&amp;ndash;3,311){{refn|The exchange rate is 2.11, based on averaging the 12&amp;nbsp;months of the exchange rates for 1981.&lt;ref name="xchg"&gt;Economagic.com&lt;/ref&gt;|group=fn}} a month from a single client.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 1977, Lim and Tan registered their marriage.&lt;ref name="john36"&gt;John (1989), 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim dominated Tan through beatings, threats, and lies.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  He persuaded her to prostitute herself to supplement their income.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also convinced her that he needed to fornicate with young women to stay healthy; thus, Tan assisted him in his business, preparing their clients for his pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 170&amp;ndash;171.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lim's influence over Tan was strong; on his encouragement and promise that sex with a younger man would preserve her youth, Tan copulated with a Malay teenager and even with her younger brother.&lt;ref name="john36" /&gt;  The boy was not her only sibling to be influenced by Lim; the medium had earlier seduced Tan's younger sister and tricked her into selling her body and having sex with the two youths.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 171.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the abuses, Tan lived with Lim, enjoying the dresses, beauty products and slimming courses bought with their income.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hoe Kah Hong ===
[[File:Hoe Kah Hong.jpg|upright|thumb|right|alt=Mugshot of a woman: her face is broad and squarish, framed by long hair.|Hoe Kah Hong steadfastly believed in Lim, conscientiously executing his orders.]]

Born on 10&amp;nbsp;September 1955, Hoe Kah Hong ({{zh|s=何家凤|t=何家鳳|p=Hé Jiāfèng}}) was eight years old when her father died; she was sent to live with her grandmother until she was fifteen.  When she returned to her mother and siblings she was constantly required to give way to her elder sister Lai Ho.  Under the perception that her mother favoured her sister, Hoe became disgruntled, showing her temper easily.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 40&amp;ndash;41.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979 her mother brought Lai to Lim for treatment, and became convinced of Lim's powers by his "needles and egg" trick.  Believing that Hoe's volatile temper could also be cured by Lim, the old woman brought her younger daughter to the medium.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 37&amp;ndash;38.&lt;/ref&gt;  After witnessing the same trick, Hoe became Lim's loyal follower.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 40&amp;ndash;42.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|She firmly believed in the trick and Lim's ability until Tan revealed to her the trick's workings during their questioning at the police station.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 196.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=fn}}  Lim desired to make Hoe one of his "holy wives", even though she was already married to Benson Loh Ngak Hua.  To achieve his goal, Lim sought to isolate Hoe from her family by feeding her lies. He claimed that her family were immoral people who practiced infidelity, and that Loh was an unfaithful man who would force her into prostitution.  Hoe believed Lim's words, and after going through a rite with him she was declared by the medium as his "holy wife".  She no longer trusted her husband and family, and became violent towards her mother.  Three months after she had first met Lim, Hoe moved from her house and went to live with him.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 43&amp;ndash;45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Loh sought his wife at Lim's flat and ended up staying to observe her treatment.  He was persuaded by her to participate in the electro-shock therapies.  In the early hours of 7&amp;nbsp;January 1980, Loh sat with Hoe, their arms locked together and their feet in separate tubs of water.  Lim applied a large voltage to Loh, who was electrocuted, while Hoe was stunned into unconsciousness.  When she woke, Lim requested her to lie to the police about Loh's death.  Hoe repeated the story Lim had given her, saying that her husband had been electrocuted in their bedroom when he tried to switch on a faulty electric fan in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 46&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt;  The coroner recorded an [[open verdict]],&lt;ref&gt;Narayanan (1989), 111.&lt;/ref&gt; and the police made no further investigations.&lt;ref name="john48"&gt;John (1989), 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite her antipathy towards Loh, Hoe was affected by his death.  Her sanity broke; she started hearing voices and hallucinating, seeing her dead husband.  At the end of May she was admitted to the [[Institute of Mental Health (Singapore)|Woodbridge Hospital]].  There, psychologists diagnosed her condition as [[schizophrenia]] and started appropriate treatments.  Hoe made a remarkably quick recovery; by the first week of July, she was discharged.  She continued her treatment with the hospital; follow-up checks showed that she was in a state of remission.  Hoe's attitude towards her mother and other family members began to improve after her stay in the hospital, although she continued to live with Lim and Tan.&lt;ref&gt;Kok (1990), 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rape and revenge ==
With Hoe and Tan as his assistants, Lim continued his trade, tricking more women into giving him money and sex.&lt;ref name="john48" /&gt;  By the time of his arrest, he had 40 "holy wives".&lt;ref&gt;Narayanan (1989), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In late 1980 he was arrested and charged with rape.  His accuser was Lucy Lau, a door-to-door cosmetic salesgirl, who had met Lim when she was promoting beauty products to Tan.  On 19&amp;nbsp;October, Lim told Lau that a ghost was haunting her, but he could exorcise it with his sex rituals.  She was unconvinced, but the medium persisted.  He secretly mixed two capsules of [[Flurazepam|Dalmadorm]], a sedative, into a glass of milk and offered it to her, claiming it had holy properties.  Lau became groggy after drinking it, which allowed Lim to take advantage of her.&lt;ref name="john48" /&gt;  For the next few weeks, he continued to abuse her by using drugs or threats.  In November, after Lim had given her parents a loan smaller than the amount they had requested, Lau made a police report about his treatment of her.  Lim was arrested on charges of rape, and Tan for abetting him.  Out on bail, Lim persuaded Hoe to lie that she was present at the alleged rape but saw no crime committed. This failed to stop the police enquiries; Lim and Tan had to extend their bail, in person, at the police station every fortnight.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lim's Altar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Various portraits and statuettes are arrayed on a small table and the wall it is against.  A small round mirror hangs above this collection of religious items.|Lim prayed [at this altar] to Buddha, Phragann, Kali, and a variety of gods.]]
Frustrated, Lim plotted to distract the police with a series of child murders.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, he believed that sacrifices of children to Kali would persuade her supernaturally to draw the attention of the police away from him.  Lim pretended to be possessed by Kali, and convinced Tan and Hoe that the goddess wanted them to kill children to wreak vengeance on Lau.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 84.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also told them Phragann demanded that he have sex with their female victims.&lt;ref&gt;Narayanan (1989), 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24&amp;nbsp;January 1981, Hoe spotted Agnes at a nearby church and lured her to the flat.  The trio plied her with food and drink that was laced with Dalmadorm.  After Agnes became groggy and fell asleep, Lim sexually abused her.  Near midnight, the trio smothered Agnes with a pillow and drew her blood, drinking and smearing it on a portrait of Kali.  Following that, they drowned the girl by holding down her head in a pail of water.&lt;ref name="john9294"&gt;John (1989), 92&amp;ndash;94.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, Lim used his electro-shock therapy device to "make doubly sure that she was dead".&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  They stuffed her body in a bag and dumped it near the lift at Block 11.&lt;ref name="john9294" /&gt;

Ghazali suffered a similar fate when he was brought by Hoe to the flat on 6&amp;nbsp;February.  He, however, proved resistant to the sedatives, taking a long time to fall asleep.  Lim decided to tie up the boy as a precaution; however, the boy awoke and struggled.  Panicking, the trio delivered [[Knifehand strike|karate chops]] to Ghazali's neck and stunned him.  After drawing his blood, they proceeded to drown their victim.  Ghazali struggled, vomiting and losing control of his bowels as he died.  Blood kept streaming from his nose after his death.  While Tan stayed behind to clean the flat, Lim and Hoe disposed of the body.  Lim noticed that a trail of blood led to their flat, so he and his accomplices cleaned as much as they could of these stains before sunrise.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 95&amp;ndash;97.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the trail of blood led the police to their flat, this resulted in their arrest.

== Trial ==
Two days after their arrest, Lim, Tan and Hoe were charged in the [[Judicial system of Singapore|Subordinate Court]] for the murders of the two children.  The trio were subjected to further interrogations by the police, and to medical examinations by prison doctors.  On 16&amp;ndash;17&amp;nbsp;September, their case was brought to the court for a [[committal procedure]].  To prove that there was a case against the accused, Deputy Public Prosecutor [[Glenn Knight]] called on 58&amp;nbsp;witnesses and arrayed 184&amp;nbsp;pieces of evidence before the magistrate.  While Tan and Hoe denied the charges of murder, Lim pleaded guilty and claimed sole responsibility for the acts.  The magistrate decided that the case against the accused was sufficiently strong to be heard at the High Court.  Lim, Tan, and Hoe remained in custody while investigations continued.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 51&amp;ndash;52.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judiciary, prosecution, and defence ===
[[File:Old Supreme Court Building 5, Jan 06.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A dome sits atop this building, which is next to a road. The building's large entrance stands at its centre and is fronted with pillars.|The murder case was heard in Courtroom No. 4 of the old Supreme Court Building.]]
The High Court was convened in the Supreme Court Building on 25&amp;nbsp;March 1983.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  Presiding over the case were two judges: Justice [[T. S. Sinnathuray|Thirugnana Sampanthar Sinnathuray]], who would deliver judgment on serial murderer [[John Martin Scripps]] 13&amp;nbsp;years later,&lt;ref&gt;Tan (October 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; and Justice Frederick Arthur Chua, who was at the time the longest serving judge in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), x.&lt;/ref&gt;  Knight continued to build his case on the evidence gathered by detective work.  Photographs of the crime scenes, together with witness testimonies, would help the court to visualise the events that led to the crimes. Other evidence&amp;mdash;the blood samples, religious objects, drugs, and the notes with Ng and Ghazali's names&amp;mdash;conclusively proved the defendants' involvement.  Knight had no eyewitnesses to the murders; his evidence was circumstantial, but he told the court in his opening statement, "What matters is that [the accused] did intentionally suffocate and drown these two innocent children, causing their deaths in circumstances which amount to murder.  And this we will prove beyond all reasonable doubt."&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tan, with Lim's and the police's permission, used $10,000 of the $159,340&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 56.&lt;/ref&gt; (US$4,730 of US$75,370) seized from the trio's flat to engage [[Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam|J. B. Jeyaretnam]] for her defence.&lt;ref&gt;Narayanan (1989), 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoe had to accept the court's offer of counsel, receiving Nathan Isaac as her defender.  Since his arrest, Lim had refused legal representation.  He [[Litigant in person|defended himself]] at the Subordinate Court hearings,&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; but could not continue to do so when the case was moved to the High Court; Singapore law requires that for capital crimes the accused must be defended by a legal professional.  Thus Howard Cashin was appointed as Lim's lawyer,&lt;ref name="john117"&gt;John (1989), 117.&lt;/ref&gt; although his job was complicated by his client's refusal to cooperate.&lt;ref name="john127"&gt;John (1989), 127.&lt;/ref&gt;  The three lawyers decided not to dispute that their clients had killed the children.  Acting on a defence of [[diminished responsibility]], they attempted to show that their clients were not sound of mind and could not be held responsible for the killings.&lt;ref&gt;Narayanan (1989), 155.&lt;/ref&gt;  If this defence had been successful, the defendants would have escaped the death penalty to face either life imprisonment, or up to 10 years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;Tan (April 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

After Knight had presented the prosecution evidence the court heard testimonies on the personalities and character flaws of the accused, from their relatives and acquaintances.  Details of their lives were revealed by one of Lim's "holy wives".  Private medical practitioners Dr. Yeo Peng Ngee and Dr. Ang Yiau Hua admitted that they were Lim's sources for drugs, and had provided the trio sleeping pills and sedatives without question on each consultation.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 107&amp;ndash;116.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Both doctors were disciplined for their actions by the Singapore Medical Council in 1990; Yeo was struck off the [[General Medical Council#Elsewhere|Medical Register]], and Ang was suspended for three months.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;  Yeo, however, successfully reapplied for his restoration in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Lim (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;|group=fn}}  The police and forensics teams gave their accounts of their investigations; Inspector Suppiah, the investigating officer-in-charge, read out the statements the defendants had made during their remand.  In these statements Lim stated that he had killed for revenge, and that he had sodomised Ng.  The accused had also confirmed in their statements that each was an active participant in the murders.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 61&amp;ndash;70.&lt;/ref&gt;  There were many contradictions among these statements and the confessions made in court by the accused, but Judge Sinnathuray declared that despite the conflicting evidence, "the essential facts of this case are not in dispute".&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lim's involvement in the crimes was further evidenced by a witness who vouched that just after midnight on 7&amp;nbsp;February 1981, at the ground floor of Block 12, he saw Lim and a woman walk past him carrying a dark-skinned boy.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 56&amp;ndash;60.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13&amp;nbsp;April, Lim took the stand.  He maintained that he was the sole perpetrator of the crimes.&lt;ref name="john121"&gt;John (1989), 121.&lt;/ref&gt;  He denied that he raped Lucy Lau or Ng, claiming that he made the earlier statements only to satisfy his interrogators.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 132&amp;ndash;133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 154&amp;ndash;156.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lim was selective in answering the questions the court threw at him; he verbosely answered those that agreed with his stance, and refused to comment on the others.&lt;ref name="john121" /&gt;  When challenged on the veracity of his latest confession, he claimed that he was bound by religious and moral duty to tell the truth.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 155.&lt;/ref&gt;  Knight, however, countered that Lim was inherently a dishonest man who had no respect for oaths.  Lim had lied to his wife, his clients, the police, and psychiatrists.  Knight claimed Lim's stance in court was an open admission that he willingly lied in his earlier statements.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 157&amp;ndash;158.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tan and Hoe were more cooperative, answering the questions posed by the court.  They denied Lim's story, and vouched for the veracity of the statements they had given to the police.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 168, 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  They told how they had lived in constant fear and awe of Lim; believing he had supernatural powers, they followed his every order and had no free will of their own.&lt;ref&gt;John (1998), 164&amp;ndash;165, 203.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Knight's questioning, however, Tan admitted that Lim had been defrauding his customers, and that she had knowingly helped him to do so.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 180&amp;ndash;181.&lt;/ref&gt; Knight then got Hoe to agree that she was conscious of her actions at the time of the murders.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 202&amp;ndash;203.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Battle of the psychiatrists ===
No one doubted that Lim, Tan, and Hoe had killed the children.  Their defence was based on convincing the judges that medically, the accused were not in total control of themselves during the crimes.  The bulk of the trial was therefore a battle between expert witnesses called by both sides.  Dr Wong Yip Chong, a senior psychiatrist in private practice, believed that Lim was mentally ill at the time of the crimes.  Claiming to be "judging by the big picture, and not fussing over contradictions",&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 208.&lt;/ref&gt; he said that Lim's voracious sexual appetite and deluded belief in Kali were characteristics of a [[Hypomania|mild manic depression]].  The doctor also said that only an unsound mind would dump the bodies close to his home when his plan was to distract the police.&lt;ref&gt;Kok (1990), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  In rebuttal, the prosecution's expert witness, Dr Chee Kuan Tsee, a psychiatrist at Woodbridge Hospital,&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 204.&lt;/ref&gt; said that Lim was "purposeful in his pursuits, patient in his planning and persuasive in his performance for personal power and pleasure".&lt;ref name="kok72"&gt;Kok (1990), 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Dr Chee's opinion, Lim had indulged in sex because through his role as a  medium he obtained a supply of women who were willing to go to bed with him.  Furthermore, his belief in Kali was religious in nature, not delusional.  Lim's use of religion for personal benefit indicated full self-control.  Lastly, Lim had consulted doctors and freely taken sedatives to alleviate his insomnia, a condition which, according to Dr Chee, sufferers from manic depression fail to recognise.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr R. Nagulendran, a consultant psychiatrist, testified that Tan was mentally impaired by [[Psychotic depression|reactive psychotic depression]].  According to him she was depressed before she met Lim, due to her family background.  Physical abuse and threats from Lim deepened her depression; drug abuse led her to hallucinate and believe the medium's lies.&lt;ref name="kok72" /&gt;  Dr Chee disagreed; he said that Tan had admitted to being quite happy with the material lifestyle Lim gave to her, enjoying fine clothes and beauty salon treatments.  A sufferer from reactive psychotic depression would not have paid such attention to her appearance.  Also, Tan had earlier confessed to knowing Lim was a fraud, but changed her stance in court to claim she was acting completely under his influence.  Although Dr Chee had neglected Lim's physical abuse of Tan in his judgment, he was firm in his opinion that Tan was mentally sound during the crimes.&lt;ref name="kok73"&gt;Kok (1990), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Dr Nagulendran and Dr Chee agreed that Hoe suffered from schizophrenia long before she met Lim, and that her stay in Woodbridge Hospital had helped her recovery.  However, while Dr Nagulendran was convinced that Hoe suffered a relapse during the time of the child killings, Dr Chee pointed out that none of the Woodbridge doctors saw any signs of relapse during the six months of her follow-up checks (16&amp;nbsp;July 1980 &amp;ndash; 31&amp;nbsp;January 1981).&lt;ref name="kok45"&gt;Kok (1990), 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 202.&lt;/ref&gt; If Hoe had been as severely impaired by her condition as Dr Nagulendran described, she would have become an invalid.  Instead, she methodically abducted and helped kill a child on two occasions.&lt;ref name="kok45" /&gt;  Ending his testimony, Dr Chee stated that it was incredible that three people with different mental illnesses should share a common delusion of receiving a request to kill from a god.&lt;ref name="john217"&gt;John (1989), 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Closing statements ===
In their closing speeches, the defence tried to reinforce the portrayal of their clients as mentally disturbed individuals.  Cashin said that Lim was a normal man until his initiation into the occult, and that he was clearly divorced from reality when he entered the "unreasonable world of atrociousness", acting on his delusions to kill children in Kali's name.&lt;ref name="john218"&gt;John (1989), 218.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jeyaretnam said that due to her depression and Lim's abuse, Tan was just "a robot", carrying out orders without thought.&lt;ref name="john218" /&gt;  Isaac simply concluded, "[Hoe's] schizophrenic mind accepted that if the children were killed, they would go to heaven and not grow up evil like her mother and others."&lt;ref name="john219"&gt;John (1989), 219.&lt;/ref&gt;  The defence criticised Dr Chee for failing to recognise their clients' symptoms.&lt;ref name="kok72" /&gt;&lt;ref name="john219" /&gt;

The prosecution started its closing speech by drawing attention to the "cool and calculating" manner in which the children were killed.&lt;ref name="john220"&gt;John (1989), 220.&lt;/ref&gt;  Knight also argued that the accused could not have shared the same delusion, and only brought it up during the trial.&lt;ref name="john219" /&gt;   The "cunning and deliberation" displayed in the acts could not have been done by a deluded person.&lt;ref name="john220" /&gt;  Tan helped Lim because "she loved [him]", and Hoe was simply misled into helping the crimes.&lt;ref name="john221"&gt;John (1989), 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  Urging the judges to consider the ramifications of their verdict, Knight said: "My Lords, to say that Lim was less than a coward who preyed on little children because they could not fight back; killed them in the hope that he would gain power or wealth and therefore did not commit murder, is to make no sense of the law of murder.  It would lend credence to the shroud of mystery and magic he has conjured up his practices and by which he managed to frighten, intimidate and persuade the superstitious, the weak and the gullible into participating in the most lewd and obscene acts."&lt;ref name="john221" /&gt;

=== Judgment ===
On 25&amp;nbsp;May 1983, crowds massed outside the building, waiting for the outcome of the trial.  Due to limited seating, only a few were allowed inside to hear Justice Sinnathuray's delivery of the verdict, which took 15&amp;nbsp;minutes.  The two judges were not convinced that the accused were mentally unsound during the crimes.  They found Lim to be "abominable and depraved" in carrying out his schemes.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 224&amp;ndash;225.&lt;/ref&gt;  Viewing her interviews with the expert witnesses as [[Self-incrimination|admissions of guilt]],&lt;ref&gt;Kok (1994), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Sinnathuray and Chua found Tan to be an "artful and wicked person", and a "willing [party] to [Lim's] loathsome and nefarious acts".&lt;ref name="john225"&gt;John (1989), 225.&lt;/ref&gt;  The judges found Hoe to be "simple" and "easily influenced".&lt;ref name="john225" /&gt;  Although she suffered from schizophrenia, they noted that she was in a state of remission during the murders; hence she should bear full responsibility for her actions.&lt;ref&gt;Kok (1994), 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  All three defendants were found guilty of murder and sentenced to be hanged.  The two women did not react to their sentences.  On the other hand, Lim beamed and cried, "Thank you, my Lords!", as he was led out.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim accepted his fate; the women did not, and appealed against their sentences.  Tan hired [[Francis Seow]] to appeal for her, and the court again assigned Isaac to Hoe.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 227.&lt;/ref&gt;  The lawyers asked the appeal court to reconsider the mental states of their clients during the murders, charging that the trial judges in their deliberations had failed to consider this point.&lt;ref name="kok73" /&gt;  The Court of Criminal Appeal reached their decision in August 1986.&lt;ref name="john228"&gt;John (1989), 228.&lt;/ref&gt;  The appeal judges which consist of [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] [[Wee Chong Jin]], Justice [[Lai Kew Chai]] and Justice [[L P Thean]] reaffirmed the decision of their trial counterparts, noting that as finders of facts, judges have the right to discount medical evidence in the light of evidence from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Kok (1990), 73&amp;ndash;74.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The Privy Council gave a similar ruling in their review of ''Walton v. the Queen'', a 1989 British murder trial.&lt;ref&gt;Kok (1990), 74.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=fn}}  Tan and Hoe's further appeals to London's [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] and Singapore President [[Wee Kim Wee]] met with similar failures.&lt;ref name="john228" /&gt;

Having exhausted all their avenues for pardon, Tan and Hoe calmly faced their fates.  While waiting on [[death row]] the trio were counselled by Catholic priests and nuns.  In spite of the reputation that surrounded Lim, Father Brian Doro recalled the murderer as a "rather friendly person".&lt;ref&gt;Davie (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  When the day of execution loomed, Lim asked Father Doro for absolution and [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]].  Likewise, Tan and Hoe had Sister Gerard Fernandez as their spiritual counsellor.  The nun converted the two female convicts to Catholicism, and they received forgiveness and Holy Communion during their final days.&lt;ref&gt;Naryanan (1989), 14&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 25&amp;nbsp;November 1988 the trio were given their last meal and led to the [[Hangman's knot|hangman's noose]].  Lim smiled throughout his last walk.  After the sentences were carried out, the three murderers were given a short Catholic funeral mass by Father Doro,&lt;ref&gt;Naryanan (1989), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and cremated on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial on the Toa Payoh ritual murders was closely followed by the populace of Singapore.  Throngs of people constantly packed the grounds of the courts, hoping to catch a glimpse of Adrian Lim and to hear the revelations first-hand.  Reported by regional newspapers in detail, the gory and sexually explicit recounting of Lim's acts offended the sensibilities of some; Canon Frank Lomax, Vicar of [[St Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore|St. Andrew's Anglican Church]], complained to ''[[The Straits Times]]'' that the reports could have a corrupting effect on the young.  His words received support from a few readers.  Others, however, welcomed the open reporting, considering it helpful in raising public awareness of the need for vigilance even in a city with low crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;John (1989), 116&amp;ndash;118&lt;/ref&gt;  Books, which covered the murders and the trial, were quickly bought by the public on their release.&lt;ref&gt;Khor (September 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khor (October 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

The revelations from the trial cast Lim as evil incarnate in the minds of Singaporeans.&lt;ref name="yap"&gt;Yap (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;  Some citizens  could not believe that anyone would willingly defend such a man.  They called Cashin to voice their anger; a few even issued death threats against him.&lt;ref name="john117" /&gt;  On the other hand, Knight's name spread among Singaporeans as the man who brought Adrian Lim to justice, boosting his career.  He handled more high-profile cases, and became the director of the [[Commercial Affairs Department]] in 1984.  He would maintain his good reputation until his conviction for corruption seven years later.&lt;ref&gt;Tan (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in prison, Lim was hated; his fellow prisoners abused and treated him as an outcast.&lt;ref&gt;Yaw (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed the crime, memories remained fresh among those who followed the case.  Journalists deemed it the most sensational trial of the 80s, being "the talk of a horrified city as gruesome accounts of sexual perversion, the drinking of human blood, spirit possession, exorcism and indiscriminate cruelty unfolded during the 41-day hearing".&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;  Fifteen years from the trial's conclusion, a poll conducted by ''[[The New Paper]]'' reported that 30 per cent of its respondents had picked the Toa Payoh ritual murders as the most horrible crime, despite the paper's request to vote only for crimes committed in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Low (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  Lim had become a benchmark for local criminals; in 2002 [[Subhas Anandan]] described his client, wife-killer Anthony Ler, as a "cooler, more handsome version of [the] notorious Toa Payoh medium-murderer".&lt;ref&gt;Vijayan (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, the local film industry made two movies based on the murder case, the first of which was ''[[The Medium (1992 film)|Medium Rare]]''.  The 1991 production had substantial foreign involvement; most of the cast and crew were American or British.  The script was locally written and intended to explore the "psyche of the three main characters".&lt;ref name="uhde1"&gt;Uhde (2000), 109&amp;ndash;110.&lt;/ref&gt;  The director, however, focused on sex and violence, and the resulting film was jeered by the audience at its midnight screening.&lt;ref name="uhde1" /&gt;  Its 16-day run brought in $130,000 (US$75,145),&lt;ref&gt;Uhde (2000), 110.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In comparison, the 1996 box-office comedy hit ''[[Army Daze]]'' took in $500,000 (US$289,017) for its first four days.&lt;ref&gt;Uhde (2000), 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exchange rate of 1.73 is derived from a 12-month average for 1991.&lt;ref name="xchg" /&gt;|group=fn}} and a reporter called it "more bizarre than the tales of unnatural sex and occult practices associated with the Adrian Lim story".&lt;ref&gt;Guneratne (2003), 172.&lt;/ref&gt;  The second film, 1997's ''God or Dog'', also had a dismal box-office performance&lt;ref&gt;Millet (2006), 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  despite a more positive critical reception.&lt;ref&gt;Uhde (2000), 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both shows had difficulty in finding local actors for the lead role; [[Zhu Houren]] declined on the basis that Adrian Lim was too unique a personality for an actor to portray accurately,&lt;ref&gt;Lee (June 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Xie Shaoguang]] rejected the role for the lack of "redeeming factors" in the murderer.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (May 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;  On the television, the murder case would have been the opening episode for ''[[True Files]]'', a crime awareness programme in 2002.  The public, however, complained that the trailers were too gruesome with the re-enactments of the rituals and murders, forcing the media company [[MediaCorp]] to reshuffle the schedule.  The Toa Payoh ritual murders episode was replaced by a less sensational episode as the opener and pushed back into a later timeslot for more mature viewers, marking the horrific nature of the crimes committed by Lim, Tan, and Hoe.&lt;ref&gt;Tan (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major ''lucha libre'' show, the [[CMLL 83rd Anniversary Show]], will take place five days after Triplemanía on September 2 at [[Arena México]] where Psycho Clown's cousin [[La Máscara (wrestler)|La Máscara]] will risk his mask as well in a match against [[Dragon Lee (wrestler)|Dragon Lee]].&lt;ref name=83Press&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAxTU19ACNE | title=Lucha Libre Conferencia de prensa del CMLL Rumbo a su 83 Aniversario | author=Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre | publisher=[[YouTube]] | date=August 10, 2016 | accessdate=August 10, 2016 | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the third-largest Mexican ''lucha libre'' promotion, IWRG will hold ''[[IWRG La Hora de la Verdad]]'' in [[Arena Naucalpan]] two days later on September 4, headlined by a ''Lucha de Apuestas'', mask vs. mask match, between [[Trauma I]] and [[Canis Lupus (wrestler)|Canis Lupus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/lucha-libre/2016/08/08/cayo-una-cabellera-trauma-y-canis-lupus-por-las-mascaras | title=Cayó una cabellera, Trauma y Canis Lupus por las máscaras | date=August 8, 2016 | accessdate=August 10, 2016 | work=MedioTiempo | publisher=[[MSN]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storylines===
The Triplemanía XXIV show featured seven [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers portrayed either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.&lt;ref name=Mondo/&gt;

After [[Pentagón Jr.]] won the 2016 [[Rey de Reyes (2016)|Rey de Reyes]] tournament, he and the rest of ''[[Los Perros del Mal]]'' were attached by the team of [[Nicho El Millonario]], [[Damián 666]], [[Halloween (wrestler)|Halloween]] and [[Pagano (wrestler)|Pagano]], claiming they were the "Real Perros del Mal", alluding to the fact that Nicho, Damián 666 and Halloween used to be part of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.com/2016/03/24/aaa-resultados-rey-de-reyes-2016-23032016-pentagon-jr-se-queda-con-la-espada-de-rey-de-reyes-y-texano-jr-con-el-megacampeonato/ | title=AAA – Resultados “Rey de Reyes 2016” – 23/03/2016 – Pentagón Jr. se queda con la espada de Rey de Reyes y Texano Jr. con el Megacampeonato | date=March 24, 2016 | accessdate=August 1, 2016 | work=SuperLuchas Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the show Pagano confirmed that he had indeed signed with AAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/Pagano656/status/713038220833886208 | title=Tengo nueva casAAA | date=March 24, 2016 | accessdate=August 1, 2016 | author=@Pagano656 | publisher=[[Twitter]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was initially known as ''La Nueva Familia Fronteriza'', later shortened to simply ''La Familia Fronteriza'' ("The [[US-Mexican border|Border]] Family"). [[Bestia 666]], son of Damián 666, was later added to the group. While the rest of ''La Familiar Fonteriza'' continued to work the storyline feud with ''Los Perros del Mal'', Pagano moved off on a tangent, starting a storyline with [[Psycho Clown]], an AAA wrestler who, like Pagano, used a clown ring character. Pagano made his official AAA in ring debut on April 18 as he, Pagano, Damián 666 and Nicho defeated ''[[Los Psycho Circus]]'' (Psycho Clown, [[Murder Clown]] and [[Monster Clown]]) by count-out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thegladiatores.com/en-leon-sigue-trazandose-el-camino-a-verano-de-escandalo/ | title=En León sigue trazándose el camino a Verano de Escándalo | date=April 19, 2016 | accessdate=July 10, 2016 | work=The Gladiatores | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mrlucha.com/2016/04/19/resultados-aaa-leon-18-abr-16-debuta-pagano-y-mas/ | title=Resultados AAA Leon 18-Abr-16: Debuata Pagano y Mas | publisher=Mr. Luchas | date=April 19, 2016 | accessdate=August 1, 2016 | language=Spanish | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911152651/http://www.mrlucha.com/2016/04/19/resultados-aaa-leon-18-abr-16-debuta-pagano-y-mas/ | archivedate=September 11, 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently Pagano and Psycho Clown faced off in a [[Hardcore wrestling]] match.

The team of [[Averno (wrestler)|Averno]] and [[Chessman (wrestler)|Chessman]], also known as ''Los Hell Brothers'' won the vacant [[AAA World Tag Team Championship]] by defeating the teams of [[Aero Star]]/[[Fénix (wrestler)|Fénix]] and [[Máscara Año 2000 Jr.]]/[[Villano IV]] at the Guerra de Titanes show.&lt;ref name=Titanes2016/&gt; ''Los Hell Brothers'' subsequently made several successful title defenses and began bragging about how there were no challengers left for them to deal with, that "no man" could defeat them. In the spring of 2016 sisters-turned-rivals [[Mari Apache]] and [[Faby Apache]] reunited as Mari returned to the ''tecnico'' side and started to team up with her sister on a regular basis. The two teamed up with their former step-mother [[Lady Apache]] and won the women's version of the 2016 [[Lucha Libre World Cup (2016)|''Lucha Libre'' World Cup]].&lt;ref name=WomensRound2&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/lucha-libre/2016/06/05/mexico-campeon-mundial-femenil-de-lucha-libre | title=México, Campeón Mundial Femenil de Lucha Libre

At the 2016 [[Guerra de Titanes (2016)|Guerra de Titanes]] show [[El Mesías]] and El Texano Jr. defeated [[Dr. Wagner Jr.]] and Psycho Clown, earning the right to wrestle for the vacant AAA Mega Championship at a later date.&lt;ref name=Titanes2016&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.com/2016/01/23/texano-jr-y-el-mesias-se-veran-las-caras-por-el-megacampeonato-aaa-la-secta-y-los-hell-brothers-nuevos-monarcas/ | title=Texano Jr. y El Mesías se verán las caras por el Megacampeonato AAA, La Secta y los Hell Brothers nuevos monarcas | date=January 23, 2016 | accessdate=July 10, 2016 | first=Calos | last=Acosta | work=SuperLuchas | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the subsequent Rey de Reyes show El Texano Jr. pinned El Mesias to become a two time AAA Mega Champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2016/01/23/el-mesias-y-texano-jr-por-el-megacampeonato | title=El Mesías y Texano Jr., por el Megacampeonato | date=January 23, 2016 | accessdate=January 26, 2016 | first=Apolo |last= Valdés | work=MedioTiempo | publisher=[[MSN]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the weeks following Rey de Reyes El Texano Jr. was repeatedly attacked by El Mesisas and later on [[Brian Cage]] as well, slowly turning El Texano Jr. ''técnicos'' in the process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15266">'''VOAD''' (Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters) means one or coalition of (usually [[Nonprofit organization|not-for-profit]]) [[Second responder|Second Responder]] organizations in the [[United States]]. These groups voluntarily help survivors after a [[disaster]]. VOAD members cannot activate, direct, or supervise one another without a special agreement (such as a [[Memorandum of understanding|MOU]]). The term "VOAD" is [[Ambiguity|ambiguous]], with at least five meanings:
# VOAD Movement
# VOAD Chapters
# Informal VOAD Networks
# VOAD Member Organizations
# Any Voluntary Organization(s) Active in a Disaster

== VOAD Movement (Meaning #1) ==
The concept of a "VOAD Movement" is found in the [[National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster]] (NVOAD) Strategic Plan. It is different from the National VOAD Organization,&lt;ref&gt;"Establish a strategic communications/messaging plan that educates stakeholders about, and promotes the visibility and image of, '''the VOAD movement, National VOAD''' and the value of supporting Member organizations." 2014-2016 National VOAD Strategic Plan, http://www.nvoad.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nvoad_strategicplan_double-sided_PRESS-1.pdf (Accessed January 16, 2016), Emphasis Added&lt;/ref&gt; but not defined.

Generally, a disaster relief organization that strives for the ideals of the 4Cs&lt;ref&gt;"Guided by the core principles of the 4Cs — cooperation, communication, coordination, and collaboration — National VOAD Members provide the leadership that builds strong, resilient communities and delivers hope in times of need." National VOAD: About Us. http://www.nvoad.org/about-us/ (Accessed January 16, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;—''communication'', ''coordination'', ''collaboration'', and ''cooperation'' and the NVOAD ''Points of Consensus''—could be considered part of the VOAD Movement. The Points of Consensus are written by various NVOAD committees on many disaster-related subjects including Disaster Spiritual Care;&lt;ref&gt;Points of Consensus: Disaster Spiritual Care, http://www.nvoad.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2014/04/POC_DisasterSpiritualCare.pdf (Accessed January 16, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Clean Up, Repair and Rebuild;&lt;ref&gt;Points of Consensus: Clean Up, Repair and Rebuild, http://www.nvoad.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2014/04/poc_cleanuprepairrebuild_final.pdf (Accessed January 16, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and Volunteer Management.&lt;ref&gt;Points of Consensus: Volunteer Management, https://sdvoad.communityos.org/cms/system/files/POC_Volunteer%20Management%5B2%5D.pdf (Accessed January 16, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

== VOAD Chapters (Meaning #2) ==
The next (and perhaps most common) usage of "VOAD" is to refer to one of hundreds of chapters and organizations that explicitly refer to themselves as a "VOAD." There are National, Multi-state, State, County, Community, and City VOAD chapters. With few exceptions, VOAD chapters are not considered "operational" entities; that is, while they convene and coordinate various disaster-response organizations, they do not have authority to direct the actions of any of its members. Local chapters may (but need not) have a formal affiliation with a parent chapter, up to the National level. Because VOADs are all voluntary, the formality, legal structure and activity of individual chapters varies widely.

In this Meaning, proper usage of "VOAD" would include, "The [[Seventh-day Adventist]]s are a member of the Colorado VOAD," where "VOAD" refers to the Colorado chapter of VOAD.

===National VOAD===
[[National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster]] is the only nationwide VOAD organization in the United States, whose members tend to be large VOAD organizations (see Meaning #4 below) and State VOAD Chapters.

===Multi-state VOADs===
Multi-state VOADs convene multiple state VOAD Chapters around common interests such as geography, population density, shared culture, or shared threat. These VOAD chapters promote the principles of the VOAD Movement (Meaning #1), improve interstate relationships, promote [[best practice]]s, or pool resources.&lt;ref&gt;About Mountain West VOAD, http://www.mwvoad.org/#!about-the-mountain-west-voad/c193a (Accessed May 6, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-state VOADs include: 
* '''Mountain West VOAD''' (MWVOAD):&lt;ref&gt;Mountain West VOAD, http://www.mwvoad.org/ (Accessed May 6, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Comprises Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, Nebraska, and Alaska.
* '''Tri-State VOAD''':&lt;ref&gt;Tri-State VOAD, http://www.tristatevoad.org/ (Accessed January 16, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Comprises Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama

===Regional, County, Community, and City VOADs===
Regional, county, and city VOADs are too numerous to list.
* '''Regional VOADs''' are VOADs that cover a large region of a [[U.S. state|state]], or multiple [[county|counties]]. 
* '''County VOADs''', typically serve one county, and often have close relationships with county [[emergency management]] personnel.
* '''Community''' COADs tend to be coalitions of community organizations that may or may not formally identify with the VOAD movement. In contrast to County or Regional VOADs, COADs are more likely to be led by a government agency, like a county emergency management department. They may or may not adopt the ''Points of Consensus''.
* Some larger [[Municipality|municipalities]] have their own '''city VOADs''', which operate similarly to a county VOAD.
Locally, the makeup, names and definitions of these types of entities are fluid and sometimes interchangeable. The difference between a Regional or County VOAD and a COAD is a matter of debate; but generally a local coalition that:
* adopts the ''Points of Consensus'', 
* has a relationship with a State VOAD chapter, and 
* whose leadership comprises voluntary organizations (rather than government employees) 
is considered a VOAD, rather than a COAD.

To illustrate the relationship among different chapter types, New York has a State VOAD, Regional VOADs, City VOADs, and Community COADs.  [https://nyvoad.communityos.org/cms/home New York VOAD] is the state chapter, while [https://www.nassaucountyny.gov/1623/LIVOAD Long Island VOAD] is a Regional VOAD. [http://bccoad.org/ Broome County COAD] is a Community COAD and [http://flolab.org/nycvoad/ New York City VOAD] is a City VOAD. In the vast majority of cases, VOADs at different levels (even in the same state) coordinate but operate independently of one another.

=== Voluntary Nature and Membership ===
VOAD organizations (Meaning #4) are "voluntary" in that they are generally not under any legal obligation to assist survivors after a disaster. Although most VOAD organizations rely on volunteers to perform their missions, an organization need not have volunteers to be voluntary. For example, the [[American Red Cross]] is composed of paid staff and volunteers, all of whom respond after a disaster.

Membership in VOAD chapters (Meaning #2) is generally limited to organizations, though some occasionally seek participation from individuals with special qualifications. Membership requirements vary widely from chapter to chapter. Some VOADs require dues, while others don't. Some require an application, while mere presence at others constitutes [[de facto]] membership. A few allow government entities, businesses, educational institutions, foundations, and corporations to be full voting members, while most treat them as non-voting "partners."&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., BoCo VOAD Bylaws, http://bocovoad.org/about-us/our-bylaws/ (Accessed January 16, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The largest constituency of VOAD Members are faith-based organizations, with major contributions from non-faith-based organizations such as the [[American Red Cross]], [[Team Rubicon]], the [[United Way]], [[2-1-1]]s, etc.

Membership and participation in chapters tends to increase during times of response and recovery, and wane between disasters.

== Informal VOAD Networks (Meaning #3) ==
The third meaning of the term "VOAD" refers to the broad informal, local network of voluntary organizations that assist in disaster recovery. These larger informal coalitions extend deep into the local community to include more traditional community non-profits, connections with local businesses, churches, etc. Such organizations may or may not be formally affiliated with a VOAD Chapter (Meaning #2).  For example, during the Long Term Recovery phase, an Unmet Needs Committee of a Long Term Recovery Group may have special relationships with local businesses or non-profit organizations who donate goods or services to clients. These businesses and non-profit organizations do not identify themselves as VOADs (Meaning #4) or formally affiliate with a VOAD chapter (Meaning #2), but they are a part of the larger VOAD network (Meaning #3).

For most VOAD Member Organizations (Meaning #4), the primary value of VOAD (Meanings #1-3) participation is access to enhance relationships. During a disaster, the value of relationships, access to resources, and pre-established roles and responsibilities cannot be understated.

== VOAD Member Organizations (Meaning #4) ==
The next concept of "VOAD" refers to individual member organizations. For example, while Colorado VOAD is a "VOAD" in the second sense, above, the American Red Cross is also itself a Voluntary Organization Active in Disasters, or a VOAD.  Thus, the following two sentences refer to "VOAD" in two senses: ''"[[LDS Humanitarian Services|LDS Charities]] is a VOAD."'' (Meaning #4) ''"LDS Charities is a member of Texas VOAD."'' (Meaning #2)

== Any Voluntary Organization(s) Active in a Disaster (Meaning #5) ==
Finally, a voluntary organization active in a disaster may include literally any organization, formal group, or informal community coalition that forms for the purpose of disaster response, even if they do not call themselves a "VOAD." For example, a local church at the epicenter of a disaster, a well-organized Facebook group, or an emergent organization that organizes [[Spontaneous Unaffiliated Volunteers]], is a VOAD under this definition.

== Activation After a Disaster ==
VOAD chapters (Meaning #2) at all levels begin coordinating and communicating with their member organizations (Meaning #4) very soon after a disaster, often using [[conference call]]s or [[Web conferencing|webinars]]. A typical call might include reports from state or local emergency managers, the [[National Weather Service]], a roll call of and reports from responding VOADs (Meaning #4). One purpose of this call is to discourage VOADs (Meanings #3, 4 &amp; 5) from "self-deploying," or attempting to assist the community in an uncoordinated manner.  While in one sense, VOADs (Meanings #3, 4 &amp; 5) ''always'' and ''only'' self-deploy (i.e., no other organization has ecclesiastical or operational authority to order another organization to deploy or demobilize), uncoordinated responses cause confusion among [[first responder]]s, emergency managers, and members of the community. Further, an uncoordinated response can produce inefficient resource deployment and duplication of efforts.

The coordination calls are often daily in the first week or two, then gradually taper in frequency to weekly. In the United States, VOAD organizations (Meanings #4 &amp; 5) often specialize in one or a few activities and services, and typically activate during one primary phase.  As the response phase ends and the long-term recovery phase begins, responsibility for ongoing work often shifts to Long Term Recovery Groups/Committees (LTRGs) and Unmet Needs Committees.  LTRGs and Unmet Needs committees may be a subcommittee of the local VOAD chapter (Meaning #2) or independent of the VOAD chapter. LTRGs and Unmet Needs committees almost always form on the local and county levels, tend to be under-resourced, and operate for 3-12 years depending on the severity of the disaster and available resources.

'''Virginity fraud''' (also known as '''chastity fraud,''' or the '''virginity lie''') is held to occur when someone lies about his or her [[virginity]] in order to obtain something of value. The concept is controversial, especially in view of fundamental societal disagreement over the definition and importance of virginity and [[gender role]]s (including the sexual [[double standard]]).

The archetypal case is of a woman who falsely claims to be a virgin for the sake of marriage to a man whom she suspects of insisting on, or at least valuing, virginity in his bride. (Other situations – such as two lovers who claimed to lose their virginity together on the internet as a [[publicity stunt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/137353.stm | work=BBC News | title=Virgin Web hoax was 'moral lesson' | date=July 22, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – may technically qualify, but are rarely discussed in the same context.)

==Operating concept of virginity==

Female virginity may either be defined solely according to the presence or absence of a [[hymen]],{{Dubious|date=July 2018}} or else according to more ambiguous, philosophical criteria.

In many societies, for a woman to [[dating (activity)|date]] or have [[boyfriend]]s – even if refraining from full [[sexual intercourse]] – would already be viewed as a violation of traditional values. (See [[technical virginity]]; [[honor killing]].) On the other hand, [[lesbian]] sexual activity would not normally be an object of concern. Meanwhile, a [[rape]] victim would be viewed as having lost her virginity by force.

An ancient wedding ritual, east European Slavic, involves relatives of the bride and/or groom waiting to receive the bloody sheet on which the bride was "deflowered", as "proof" of her former virginity (which would often be specified in the [[marriage contract]]). Techniques to simulate the bleeding and/or physical sensation of rupture are equally ancient. In rural Egypt, chicken blood is used if – for whatever reason – there is no real blood on the wedding night. The bloody sheet is then shown to the neighborhood as proof of virginity "deflowering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gwilliam | first= Tassie |title=Female Fraud: Counterfeit Maidenheads in the Eighteenth Century. | journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality |volume= 6 |issue= 4 | pages=518–548 |date=April  1996 | pmid=11618773 |jstor= 4617220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of detection==
{{Main|Virginity test}}

Several methods of "virginity fraud detection" claim to be available, but cannot adequately determine the status of virginity.

#Inspection to determine whether [[Hymenorrhaphy|hymen restoration surgery]] has been performed, and/or the vagina's general state of elasticity. In many  societies, such inspections have traditionally been conducted by older female relatives of the prospective groom, but are increasingly performed by doctors, who may issue certificates of virginity for the benefit of the groom's family. Also, digital inspection may fail to detect [[surgical suture]] which are visible only by means of specialized medical instruments.  However, this cannot adequately prove virginity.  As the hymen and vagina are elastic, there have been cases where women have actually given birth and had their hymen return to its original state.  Additionally, hymens can be broken through nonsexual activity such as horseback riding.
#[[Background check]]s by a [[private detective]] aimed at uncovering a woman's romantic and/or medical history.  This unfortunately relies on reporting of people who may have a score to settle with the woman being investigated. A number of attempts at virginity fraud are exposed by a woman's contact with medical clinics specializing in hymen restoration procedures.

==Public response==

In the West, awareness of hymen replacement surgery has led to criticisms of the procedure, on the grounds that it is medically unnecessary and contributes to pernicious social practices; alongside recognition that women's reasons for undergoing it are not frivolous (as might be claimed of other forms of elective plastic surgery). Little, if any, concern has been expressed for the intended victims of virginity fraud. Muslim responses have questioned the motives of women undergoing the procedure, as well as of prospective grooms whose attitudes have made the procedure so prevalent.

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altmuslim.com/a/a/a/3334|title=A woman’s burden of proof|author=Rafia Zakaria|date=October 14, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609101333/http://www.altmuslim.com/a/a/a/3334|archivedate=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a French Muslim man in [[Lille, France|Lille]] sought an [[annulment]] on the grounds that his bride (also Muslim) turned out not to be a virgin. She denied having misled him, but did not contest the appeal, which was duly granted. In 2009, amidst a wave of media attention, French justice minister [[Rachida Dati]] ordered the government to appeal this decision (on the grounds that an important element of French public policy was at issue). [[Ronald Sokol]], in an editorial for the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', writes that

::The question was whether the woman's virginity was an essential element of the marriage contract. If it was, then the contract could be annulled. If it was not, then the couple was validly married.&lt;ref name="CSMonitor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2009/0303/p09s01-coop.html|title=The curious case of chastity fraud|first=Ronald|last=Sokol|date=3 March 2009|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeals court reversed the judgment. Sokol continues:

::The government argued that the wife's virginity was not an essential condition because her unchaste past has no effect on married life. The judges agreed. Even if she had lied, they said, it did not matter, as a woman's lies about her past love affairs are not matters essential to her married life. In short, a woman's past is her own.&lt;ref name="CSMonitor"/&gt; 
It became known as the "Virginity Lie" case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2008/06/24/new-french-muslim-chief-on-the-virginity-lie-case/ | work=Reuters | title=New French Muslim chief on the "virginity lie" case | date=June 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4844">[[File:Washington Elm, Cambridge.jpg|thumb]]
The '''Washington Elm''' was a tree on [[Cambridge Common]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] that lived approximately 210 years and died in 1923.

==History==
Beginning as early as the 1830s, it became popular legend that "under this tree [[George Washington|Washington]] first took command of the American Army" (supposedly the words of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]). The publication of the fictional "eye-witness" journal ''[[The Diary of Dorothy Dudley]]'' in 1876 furthered the legend. Although George Washington did take command of the army on 3 July 1775, there is no official documentation stating that this event took place under the tree.

In 1923, the tree was very fragile and diseased. Workers from the parks department of Cambridge were cutting two of the remaining limbs. Upon cutting the second limb, the entire tree fell over onto its iron fence and brought the [[Boston Elevated Railway]] cable to within 15 feet (4.57 m) of the ground. The tree was divided up into approximately 1000 pieces, and these were distributed to all states and their legislatures. The cross-section of the tree was sent to [[Mount Vernon]]. About 150 pieces were given over the counter, a few hundred were mailed throughout the country, and some [[fraternal organizations]] received pieces as well.

In 1925, the legend was openly discredited at the Cambridge Historical Society (CHS), when Samuel F. Batchelder read a paper&lt;ref name=batchelder&gt;[http://www.cambridgehistory.org/node/8079 The Washington Elm Tradition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216151503/http://www.cambridgehistory.org/node/8079 |date=2015-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he later reprinted as ''The Washington Elm Tradition: "Under This Tree Washington First Took Command of the American Army" Is It True?''. Batchelder revealed the forgeries in the tales told about Washington and the tree, in short calling the myth altogether not realistic, but the beliefs persist today. Many websites are outdated in stating that the tree still exists and that it is indeed where Washington first took command.

Today, a plaque embedded in the pavement of Garden Street (at its Mason St. intersection) marks where the tree used to stand. The Cambridge Historical Commission (CHC) has called the association of Washington and the elm a "myth" and stated that "the image of the tree remains a symbol of patriotism in Cambridge."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cambridgema.gov/historic/aboutchc/faqpage Cambridge Historical Commission FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descendant trees==
Of the 1,000 pieces that were distributed, many are still standing today. 

Bellingham, WA - 1621 Eldridge Ave. While the story of how the particular tree came to live in Bellingham is unclear, a tree still standing (as of 2017) at this address is said to be a descendant of the Washington Elm.{{whom|date=June 2017}}

Loveland, CO  205 E Eisenhower Blvd, Loveland, CO 80537. The Washington Elm Tree in the Walgreen's parking lot between Lincoln and Cleveland avenues has been here since a sickly version of the tree first came to Loveland in 1932. Root shoots from the original tree were sent to DAR chapters throughout the nation, including Loveland's Namaqua Chapter, and the tree was planted in the yard of what was then the Lincoln School. The tree is one of the few Washington Elm offshoots still thriving in the nation, but another DAR member is working to carry on the tree's heritage. Corrine Yahn, who teaches geology at Front Range Community College, works with Front Range laboratory coordinator Susan Brown on micropropagation. For about a year, Yahn said they've been using samples from the Loveland elm to essentially try and clone the tree. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.reporterherald.com/news/ci_25738880/loveland-daughters-american-revolution-raise-funds-historic-tree&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich Wilhelm Voigt''' (13 February 1849 &amp;ndash; 3 January 1922) was a German [[Impostor]] who, in 1906, masqueraded as a [[Prussia]]n [[military officer]], rounded up a number of soldiers under his "command", and "confiscated" more than 4,000 [[German gold mark|marks]] from a municipal treasury. Although he served two years in prison, he became a [[folk hero]] as ''The Captain of Köpenick'' (''Der {{Audio|De-Hauptmann von Köpenick.ogg|Hauptmann von Köpenick}}'') and was pardoned by Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]].

==Early life==
Voigt was born in [[Tilsit]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (now [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast]]). In 1863, aged 14, he was sentenced to 14 days in prison for theft, which led to his expulsion from school. He learned [[shoemaking]] from his father.

Between 1864 and 1891, Voigt was sentenced to prison for a total of 25 years for [[theft]]s, [[forgery]] and [[burglary]]. The longest sentence was a 15-year conviction for an unsuccessful burglary of a court cashier's office. He was released on 12 February 1906.

Voigt drifted from place to place until he went to live with his sister in [[Rixdorf]] near [[Berlin]]. He was briefly employed by a well-reputed shoemaker until the local police expelled him from Berlin as an undesirable, based solely on the fact that he was an ex-convict, on 24 August 1906. Officially he left for [[Hamburg]], although he remained in Berlin as an unregistered resident.

==Captain of Köpenick==
[[Image:Hauptmann von Koepenick - Bronzestatue.jpg|thumb|A statue of Wilhelm Voigt as the Captain of Köpenick at Köpenick city hall]]
[[File:Berliner Gedenktafel Wilhelm Voigt.jpg|thumb|A commemorative [[memorial]] plate for Wilhelm Voigt and the Captain of Köpenick at Köpenick city hall. The text explains the happenings in short form, including the exact date, and the later following fame of the case through the play of [[Carl Zuckmayer]].]]
[[File:DPAG-20060902-HauptmannKoepenick.jpg|thumb|German postage stamp, 2006]]

On 16 October 1906 Voigt was ready for his next caper. He had purchased parts of used captain's uniforms from different shops and tested their effect on soldiers. He had resigned from the shoe factory ten days previously. He took the uniform out of baggage storage, put it on and went to the local army barracks, stopped four [[grenadier]]s and a [[sergeant]] on their way back to barracks and told them to come with him. Indoctrinated to obey officers without question, they followed. He dismissed the commanding sergeant to report to his superiors and later commandeered six more soldiers from a shooting range. Then he took a train to [[Köpenick]], east of Berlin, occupied the local [[City hall (administration)|city hall]] with his soldiers and told them to cover all exits. He told the local police to "care for law and order" and to "prevent calls to Berlin for one hour" at the local post office.

He had the [[treasurer]] von Wiltberg and [[mayor]] Georg Langerhans arrested, supposedly for suspicions of crooked [[bookkeeping]], and confiscated 4002 [[German gold mark|mark]]s and 37 pfennigs - with a receipt, of course (he signed it with his former jail director's name). Then he commandeered two carriages and told the grenadiers to take the arrested men to the [[Neue Wache]] in Berlin for interrogation. He told the remaining guards to stand in their places for half an hour and then left for the train station. He later changed into [[civilian]] clothes and disappeared.

==Unraveling and capture==
[[Image:Hauptmann von Koepenick - Uniform.jpg|thumb|Uniform worn by Wilhelm Voigt as the Captain of Köpenick]]
In the following days the [[Germany|German]] press speculated on what had really happened. At the same time the army ran its own investigation. The public seemed to be positively amused by the daring of the culprit.

Voigt was arrested on 26 October and on 1 December sentenced to four years in prison for forgery, impersonating an officer and wrongful imprisonment. However, much of public opinion was on his side. German [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] [[pardon]]ed him on 16 August 1908. There are some claims that even the Kaiser was amused by the incident, referring to him as an ''amiable scoundrel'', and being pleased with the authority and feelings of reverence that his military obviously commanded in the general population.&lt;ref name="Blundell158"/&gt;

The British press were also amused, seeing it as confirmation of their stereotypes about Germans. In its 27 October 1906 issue, the editors of ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' were to note gleefully:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For years the Kaiser has been instilling into his people reverence for the omnipotence of militarism, of which the holiest symbol is the German uniform. Offences against this fetish have incurred [[wikt:condign|condign]] punishment. Officers who have not considered themselves saluted in due form have drawn their swords with impunity on offending privates.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In that same issue, writer [[G. K. Chesterton]] would point out:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The most absurd part of this absurd fraud (at least, to English eyes) is one which, oddly enough, has received comparatively little comment. I mean the point at which the Mayor asked for a warrant, and the Captain pointed to the bayonets of his soldiery and said, 'These are my authority'. One would have thought anyone would have known that no soldier would talk like that.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath==
Voigt decided to capitalize on his fame. His wax figure appeared in the [[wax museum]] in [[Unter den Linden]] four days after his release. He appeared in the museum to sign his pictures but public officials banned the appearances on the same day. He appeared in small theatres in a play that depicted his exploit and signed more photographs as the Captain of Köpenick. In spite of the ban he toured in [[Dresden]], [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]] in variety shows, restaurants and amusement parks. In 1909, he published a book in [[Leipzig]], ''How I became the Captain of Köpenick'', which sold well. Although his [[United States]] tour almost failed because the immigration authorities refused to grant him a [[visa (document)|visa]], he arrived in 1910 via [[Canada]]. He also ended up in [[Madame Tussaud]]'s museum in [[London]].

In 1910, he moved to [[Luxembourg]] and worked as a waiter and shoemaker. He received a life pension from a rich Berlin [[dowager]].&lt;ref name="Blundell158"&gt;{{cite book | last = Blundell | first = Nigel | title = The World's Greatest Mistakes | publisher = Bounty Books | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-600-57232-3 |chapter=The great pretender who duped a city's mayor|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he bought a house and retired, but post-[[World War I]] [[inflation]] led to his financial ruin. Voigt died in Luxembourg in 1922. His grave is on the Cimetière Notre-Dame in Luxembourg ({{Coordinate|NS=49.6154463|EW=6.1188853|type=landmark|dim=2|region=LU|text=DMS|name=Grave of Wilhelm Voigt}}).

==Plays and movies==
In 1931, German author [[Carl Zuckmayer]] wrote a play about the affair called ''[[The Captain of Köpenick (play)|The Captain of Köpenick]]'', which shifts the focus from the event at Köpenick itself to the prelude, showing how his surroundings and his situation in life had helped Voigt form his plan. An [[English language]] adaptation was written by [[John Mortimer]], and first performed by the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] company at the [[Old Vic]] on 9 March 1971 with [[Paul Scofield]] in the title role.

Various movies were produced about Wilhelm Voigt (most of them based on Zuckmayer's play), among them ''[[The Captain from Köpenick (1931 film)|Der Hauptmann von Köpenick]]'' (1931); ''[[The Captain from Köpenick (1945 film)|The Captain from Köpenick]]'' (1945), starring [[Albert Bassermann]]; ''[[The Captain from Köpenick (1956 film)|Der Hauptmann von Köpenick]]'' (1956), with [[Heinz Rühmann]]; a 1956 U.S. TV adaptation starring [[Emmett Kelly]], the circus clown;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tops|first1=T.V.|title=Famous Clown Takes a Straight Dramatic Role|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20045804/the_san_bernardino_county_sun/|accessdate=13 May 2018|work=The San Bernadino County Sun|date=22 April 1956|page=22|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1960 TV movie ''Der Hauptmann von Köpenick'', featuring [[Rudolf Platte]]; and the 1997 TV movie ''[[Der Hauptmann von Köpenick (1997 film)|Der Hauptmann von Köpenick]]'', starring [[Harald Juhnke]].

The basic line of stageplays and movies was the pitiful [[Catch-22 (logic)|catch-22]] situation of Voigt trying to earn his living honourably in Berlin: "No residence address - no job. No job - no residence (rented room). No residence - no passport. No passport - getting ousted."

'''William Fuller''', [[England|English]] impostor, was born at [[Milton, Kent|Milton]] in [[Kent]]. His paternity is doubtful, but he was related to the family of Herbert.

After 1688, Fuller served [[Mary of Modena]], [[Queen consort]] of [[James II of England]], and the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] while seeking at the same time to gain favor with [[William III of England]]. After associating with [[Titus Oates]], being imprisoned for debt and pretending to reveal Jacobite plots, the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in 1692 declared he was an imposter, cheat and false accuser.

Having stood in the [[pillory]], he was again imprisoned until 1695, when he was released; at this time he took the opportunity to revive the old and familiar story that Mary of Modena was not the mother of [[James Francis Edward Stuart]],  [[Prince of Wales]]. In 1701, he published his autobiographical ''Life of William Fuller and some Original Letters of the late King James''. Unable to prove the assertions made in his writings he was put in the pillory, whipped and fined. He was still in [[Newgate Prison]] in 1730, when he wrote to [[William Wake]], [[archbishop of Canterbury]], disavowing (not for the first time) his earlier inventions. He was almost certainly the William Fuller, prisoner, whose burial is recorded in the register of Christ Church Newgate on 24 March 1733.

Fuller's other writings are ''Mr. William Fuller's trip to Bridewell, with a full account of his barbarous usage in the [[pillory]]; The sincere and hearty confession of Mr. William Fuller'' (1704); and ''An humble appeal to the impartial judgment of all parties in Great Britain'' (1716).

{{See also|History of Worcestershire#Civil War|History of Worcester#Civil War}}
[[Worcestershire]] was the county where the first battle and last battle of the [[English Civil War]] took place.
The first battle, the [[Battle of Powick Bridge]], fought on  23 September 1642, was a cavalry skirmish and a victor for the Royalists ([[Cavaliers]]). The final battle, the [[battle of Worcester]], fought on 3 September 1651, was decisive and ended the war with a Parliamentary ([[Roundhead]]) victory and King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]][[escape of Charles II|a wanted fugitive]].

During the [[First English Civil War|First Civil War]] the county was under the control of the Royalists although many of their fortified garrisons were besieged by Parliamentarian forces at one time of another. For example Worcester was [[Siege of Worcester (1643)|besieged twice]] before [[Siege of Worcester|finally surrendering]] on 23 July 1646. After the surrender many Royalist families in Worcestershire had their estates [[Sequestration (law)|sequested]] and [[Committee for Compounding with Delinquents|had to compound]] (pay a fine to buy back their property) calculated in part by the expected income from their estate and also by their involvement in the Royalist cause during the civil war.

Other than the [[Broadway Plot]] of January 1648 the events of the Second [[English Civil War]] (1648) passed Worcestershire by.

During [[Third English Civil War]] Charles II lead a predominantly Scottish Royalist army to the City of Worcester hoping that English Cavaliers would rally to his banner. While a few did, Charles's army was surrounded by a much larger Parliamentary army under the command of Oliver Cromwell and comprehensively defeated in what Cromwell described as a "Crowning Mercy".

==Prelude to war==
{{main article|Personal Rule|Long Parliament}}
{{see also|Western Rising and disafforestation riots}}
[[File:Richard Baxter Colour.jpg|thumb|Richard Baxter, the leading Puritan in Kidderminster, noted the rising opposition to King Charles' policies of taxation and rule without Parliament]]
Charles I's policies of rule without Parliament forced him to raise taxes on imports of goods known as '[[tonnage and poundage]]'. Policies like these particularly reduced the profitability of trade and created opposition in urban centres including Worcester. Similarly, the [[Ship Money]] taxation levied in 1636 fell heavily on Worcester, which was the sixteenth highest paying city in England. Puritans including [[Richard Baxter]] noted the mounting opposition to Royal policies within the county. The unpopularity of these Royalist policies stemmed from the perception that Charles I was attempting to establish a more authoritarian, non-Parliamentary kind of monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|pp=29-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worcestershire had also seen a number of divisive enclosure schemes during Charles' reign, including attempts to enclose [[Malvern Chase]] and the more successful sale of [[Feckenham Forest]] in the 1630s, which in both cases had led to rioting as well as the displacement of the rural poor that had depended on the use of these Royal lands as effectively common land, with long-established although informal usage rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lees|1877|pp=16-17}}; {{harvnb|Sharp|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other local grievances against the Crown included action to suppress profitable tobacco production, which was well established in the Vale of Evesham.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles I was simultaneously pursuing religious policies that provoked suspicion in Worcestershire. Although the county had a Catholic minority among its aristocratic families, the rest of the population was firmly Anglican, with a growing group of more radical Protestants in some of its northern towns, such as Kidderminster. Charles' apparent Catholic sympathies, such as the reforms of [[William Laud]] that reintroduced many of the trappings of Catholicism back into the Church of England, would have been viewed with suspicion by many. In the early 1640s, stories of massacres of protestants in Ireland helped lead to rumours of Catholic plots than spread through the county leading to anti-Catholic riots in Bewdley in late 1641, and instructions to local militias to guard against conspiracies in the following months.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outbreak of the war==
Like many parts of England, there was little enthusiasm for either side, and the initial instincts of many was to try to avoid conflict.  Different parts of the county had different sympathies, for instance [[Evesham]] was notably Parliamentarian, and [[Kidderminster]] also had a strong Parliamentarian contingent. 

The immediate cause of the war was a struggle between Parliament and the Crown to control of the country's armed forces, the [[Trained Bands]], which were ordinarily under the control of the crown. A split between the county's aristocratic families, who helped organise Royalist control of the Trained Bands, and the city of Worcester, which attempted to gain control its own forces from the county from 1641, can also be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|pp=34-36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the city of Worcester equivocated about whether to support the Parliamentary cause immediately before the outbreak of [[English Civil War|civil war]] in 1642, raising its own independent and neutral armed forces in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royalists started organising military forces at the Town Hall in mid July, but the city council then sided with Parliament, after the Worcestershire MPs Humphrey Salway and John Wylde returned to galvanise the city against Royalist control. A Grand Jury then declared the King's Commission of Array illegal, and gathered signatures in support of Parliament's Militia Ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Royalist gentry from across Worcestershire continued to organise the Trained Bands for the King, however, and organised a support of a Grand Jury in early August that ordered the arrest of leading Parliamentarians and summoned the Trained Bands to Pitchcroft on 12 August. The quality of the troops was however rather low, with makeshift armaments and supplies.&lt;ref name=atkinp4445&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|pp=40-44}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the forces were summoned again at the outbreak of war on 22 August, just 500 men were present, a much lower figure than might be expected, suggesting a lack of enthusiasm for either side and desire to avoid the conflict if possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|pp=46-47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time a Parliamentary force was moving from London to secure Coventry and Warwick. the Royalist trained bands of Warwickshire requested help from Worcestershire, but did not received it, as the Commissioner did not wish to force his troops to serve outside the county against their expectations. Even at this very early stage, the tension between the localised Royalist military structures and the need for a national fighting effort could be seen.&lt;ref name=atkinp4445/&gt;

==Royalist control of Worcestershire==
The numbers of Worcester gentry that were active Royalist military and civilian leaders was quite small. Atkin calculates that around 25 individuals make up the core of the Royalist organisers in the country. 44 were arrested at the end of the war. Both are much lower numbers than the size of the gentry class, suggesting that most people tried to keep out of the conflict as best they could.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|pp=44-45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worcester and the county was more or less under Royalist control at the start of the conflict. The Cathedral was used to store arms during the war, possibly as early as September 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royalists were using the building to store munitions when Essex briefly retook the city after the Powick Bridge skirmish on its outskirts. Parliamentary troops then ransacked the Cathedral building. Stained glass was smashed and the organ destroyed, along with library books and monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Worcester, Dudley and [[Hartlebury Castle|Hartlebury]] were Royalist garrisons in the county. Worcester in particular had to bear the expense of sustaining and billeting a large number of Royalist troops. During the Royalist occupation, the suburbs were destroyed to make defence easier. Responsibility for maintenance of defences was transferred to the military command. High taxation was imposed, and many male residents [[Impressment|impressed]] into the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the war, the number of people within Worcester who were on poor relief had risen dramatically, while trade and commerce had declined.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The same pressures created great strain on the county as a whole, as it had to sustain a large, unproductive force drawn out of its productive labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taxation was heavy and requisitioning by armies could be particularly debilitating. At times, reprisals could be very harsh. In 1643, for instance, Royalist troops used physical violence and deliberately destroyed pea and bean crops at Amscote and Treadington when residents tried to resist their demands. The Royalist horse regiments stripped much of northern Worcestershire of produce to the extent that [[Droitwich]], [[Bromsgrove]], [[King's Norton]], [[Alvechurch]] and [[Abbots Morton]] were unable to pay their tax demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proximity of Worcestershire to Parliamentary forces to the north around Birmingham, to the east in Warwickshire, and at certain times to the south in Bristol and Gloucestershire, made the county vulnerable to raiding and requisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|pp=100-106}}; on strategic position see {{harvnb|Atkin|2004|pp=108-106}} and {{harvnb|Atkin|2004|pp=61-64}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nevertheless, the county was strategically vital to the Royalists, as a bridge from their mostly Western territories including Wales and Ireland back to their headquarters in Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|pp=60-62}}; {{harvnb|Lloyd|1993|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Worcestershire also provided the Royalists with industrial capacity to produce armaments and munitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sir William Waller etching 1643 by Pieter Rodermondt.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Portrait of Sir William Waller, 1643, whose raids thoroughly depleted the Vale of Evesham]]
In June 1644, General [[William Waller]]'s force of around 10,000 men pursued the King's army into Worcestershire as it retreated from Oxford. Waller was supported by the residents of Evesham, who repaired their bridge which had been broken to slow his passage into Worcestershire; the town was heavily fined and the Mayor George Kempe arrested after Waller withdrew. Waller's army during June lived off whatever they could requisition, first in the Vale of Evesham, then Bromsgrove and Kidderminster. After failing to take Bewdley, they occupied Droitwich before returning to Evesham.  Parts of Waller's force was ill-disciplined, and the line between requisitioning and simple theft became unclear. After Waller had left, the Royalist army in the vale of Evesham was forced to bring in supplies from outside, for instance Bridgenorth and Shropshire, because of the scale of requisitioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|pp=94-99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish army that entered Worcestershire in 1645 gained a particularly bad reputation, reflected in claims made to the Exchequer after the war. They seem to have taken whatever sheep they could and plundered items as diverse as clothing, household items, wagons, brooches and food. There were also claims of widespread destruction of crops as they advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royalist Hartlebury garrison also gained a bad reputation for sequestrating local supplies and thereby depleting the neighbouring area through the war.{{citation needed|also needs expansion|date=November 2018}}

Bands of [[Clubmen]] formed in west Worcestershire in the later part of the first war, with the objective of keeping both armies and their demands away from the rural civilian population, to resist despoilation and requisitioning. There was also a vein of resentment towards the prominent role given many Catholics in the county. The Clubmen's [[Woodbury Hill]] proclamation stated that they would not obey any Papist or Papist Recusant, "nor ought [they] … be trusted in any office of state, justice, or judicature".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|pp=117-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Royalist power collapsed in May 1646, [[siege of Worcester|Worcester was placed under siege]]. Worcester had around 5,000 civilians, together with a Royalist garrison of around 1,500 men, facing a 2,500–5,000 strong force of the [[New Model Army]]. Worcester finally surrendered on 23 July, bringing the First Civil War to a close in Worcestershire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|pp=125-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the surrender of the city, the Royalist leaders were forced to swear that they would not fight against Parliament again, a promise that a number of them broke in 1651.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lloyd|1993|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scottish troops and the Third Civil War==
[[File:Battle of Worcester.jpg|thumb|right|Battle of Worcester]]
In 1651 a Scottish army marched south along the west coast in support of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s attempt to regain the Crown and entered the county. The 16,000 Scottish force caused Worcester's council to vote to surrender as it approached, fearing further violence and destruction. The Parliamentary garrison decided to withdraw to Evesham in the face of the overwhelming numbers against them. The Scots were billeted in and around the Worcester, again at great expense and causing new anxiety for the residents. The Scots were joined by very limited local forces, including a company of 60 men under [[John Talbot, 10th Earl of Shrewsbury|John Talbot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|pp=142-143}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Battle of Worcester]] (3 September 1651), took place in the fields a little to the west (near the village of [[Powick]]) and south of the city. Charles II's army was easily defeated by Cromwell's forces of 30,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|pp=142-147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles II returned to his headquarters in what is now known as King Charles House in the Cornmarket,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; before [[escape of Charles II|escaping north out of the county, and eventually on to France]], aided by a number of Worcestershire's Catholic gentry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the battle, Worcester was heavily looted by the Parliamentarian army, with an estimated £80,000 of damage done, and the subsequent debts still not recovered into the 1670s. The Scottish troops that were not captured meanwhile were attacked by locals as they fled. Around 10,000 prisoners, mostly Scots, were held captive, and either sent to work on the Fens drainage projects, or transported to the New World to work as forced labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkin|2004|pp=144-147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First English Civil War===
{{see also|First English Civil War}}

1642.  King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] moved from [[Nottingham]] to [[Shrewsbury]]. The [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], who commanded the Parliament army, was ordered to prevent the King advancing on London, so marched from [[Northampton]] to [[Stratford-on-Avon]], [[Pershore]] to [[Worcester]], shortly before Essex arrived at [[Worcester]], the first [[Battle of Powick Bridge|major cavalry skirmish]] took place in at [[Powick|Powick Bridge]]. Charles, having completed his preparations, marched by [[Wolverhampton]], [[Birmingham]], towards [[Banbury]], thus getting between Essex and [[London]]. Turning round, he defeated Essex at the [[Battle of Edgehill]], and slowly marched on towards London, before turning after the [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Battle of Brentford]] retreating first to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and then to [[Oxford]]. The result of the advance by the Royalists towards London was that the Parliament troops evacuated Worcestershire.{{sfn|Willis-Bund|1905|p=1}}

1643. The King established his headquarters at Oxford, and was most anxious to win the highlands of the [[Cotswolds]] and the line of the river [[Severn]]. The Parliamentarians had two armies. Their plan was that the two armies, one of which was engaged before Reading under Essex, the other under [[William Waller]] had its headquarters at [[Bristol]], should unite and take Oxford. Essex took Reading. Waller, operating from [[Gloucester]], cleared the county, and by taking [[Hereford]] cut off communication with [[Wales]]. To make all safe in the [[Severn]] Valley, Charles besieged Gloucester, but Essex was able to raise the siege.{{sfn|Willis-Bund|1905|p=1}}

1644. Again Parliamentary forces tried the same plan as the previous year. Essex and Waller were to join and march on Oxford. They did so, and very nearly caught Charles I, but he escaped, marched by [[Broadway, Worcestershire|Broadway]] to [[Evesham]], [[Pershore]] to Worcester, and on to Bewdley. Waller followed him, but the two armies did not come to close quarters; the only fighting was Wilmot's attempt to relieve Dudley Castle, which was being besieged by Lord Denbigh. Charles retired towards Oxford, followed by Waller, who was defeated by Wilmot at the [[Battle of Cropredy Bridge]]. Charles then returned into Worcestershire, and stayed at Evesham for some days.{{sfn|Willis-Bund|1905|p=1}}

1645. [[Edward Massey]], the Governor of [[Gloucester]], stormed and took Evesham, thus severing the Royalist line of march from Worcester to Oxford. Charles marched to [[Inkberrow]], [[Droitwich]], [[Bromsgrove]], and on to Leicester and then to [[Naseby]], where [[Battle of Naseby|he was defeated]]; then back by [[Kidderminster]], [[Bewdley]] to Hereford and [[South Wales]]. The Scottish army came to the help of the English, and marched to [[Alcester]] on their way to attack Worcester, but turned off to [[Droitwich]], Bewdley, and so to Hereford, which they besieged. Charles marched north, and working round reached Oxford. Having got some troops together, he marched to the relief of Hereford. He stayed several days in Worcester, marched from there to [[Bromyard]] and on to Hereford, but on his approach the Scotch raised the siege, marched to Gloucester, crossed the Severn, then marching through [[Cheltenham]], Evesham, to [[Stratford-on-Avon]] on their way towards [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]].{{sfn|Willis-Bund|1905|pp=1, 2}}

1646. During the winter a Royalist army was collected in Wales, [[Herefordshire]], and Worcestershire, and marched towards Oxford, but were met by the Parliamentary troops near [[Stow-on-the-Wold]] [[Battle of Stow-on-the-Wold|and destroyed]]. Shortly after this Charles left Oxford and gave himself up to the Scots. He issued orders to his captains and officers to deliver up the places they held. Dudley Castle surrendered, as did [[Hartlebury]]. Worcester was besieged and held out to July when it had to surrender. Included in the Articles were Madresfield and Strensham.  With their surrender the First Civil War, so far as Worcestershire was concerned, came to an end.{{sfn|Willis-Bund|1905|p=2}}

===Second Civil War===
{{see also|Second English Civil War}}

1647. During the whole of the year Royalist plots went on to bring about the King's release, or for a rising. The chief of these was the [[Broadway Plot]].{{sfn|Willis-Bund|1905|p=2}}

1648. The Royalist plot, ended in the second Civil War, the chief feature in which was the siege of [[Colchester]]. An attempt at a rising, organised by Colonel [[Dud Dudley]], was made in Worcestershire, but it was suppressed, Dudley taken prisoner, sent to London, and condemned to die. The morning before his execution he escaped.{{sfn|Willis-Bund|1905|p=2}}

1649. King Charles I was executed. Charles II. went to Scotland and was proclaimed King of Scotland. The Parliament troops were engaged in putting down the Irish.{{sfn|Willis-Bund|1905|p=2}}

===Third Civil War===
{{see also|Third English Civil War}}
1650. [[Oliver Cromwell]], having finished off the Irish, went to Scotland and defeated Leslie and the Scots at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)|Battle of Dunbar]].{{sfn|Willis-Bund|1905|p=2}}

1651. After a good deal of negotiations and manoeuvres Charles II, at the end of July, invaded England, marching through [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] on London. When he got to Stafford it was thought desirable to halt for reinforcements from Wales, and to meet these men Charles marched to Worcester. Cromwell, meanwhile proceeded down the east coast, marched across to Evesham, thus getting between Charles and London, advanced on to Worcester, attacked and routed him at the [[Battle of Worcester]].{{sfn|Willis-Bund|1905|p=2}}

==Notes==
{{notelist|refs=
{{efn|name="Roads"|The six roads numbered on the map are the important thoroughfares that linked Worcester with the rest of the country:{{sfn|Willis-Bund|1905|p=8}}

&lt;br/&gt;(1.) The Oxford and London Road. This entered the County near Honeybourne, passed through Bretforton, over the Avon at Offenham at Twyford Bridge, where Offenham Boat is now, then through Norton, Wyre, Pinvin, White Ladies' Aston, Spetchley, Red Hill, to Worcester. This is and was the direct road from Worcester to Oxford, and by it all convoys of supplies and all detachments of recruits would have to pass.

&lt;br/&gt;(2.) At Worcester this road divided, one branch to the right is the road to the north, spoken of, near Birmingham, as the " Bristol Road." It crossed Barbourne Bridge and went to Droitwich, Bromsgrove, over the Lickey to Northfield, and passed out of the County into Warwickshire at Bourn Brook.

&lt;br/&gt;(3.) Another branch, also going to the north, after crossing Barbourne Bridge, went to the left through Ombersley and Hartlebury; here it again branches off the road to the right, going through the parishes of Chaddesley Corbett and Belbroughton, past Hagley and Pedmore to Stourbridge into Staffordshire. This is the road by which Charles II went after the Battle of Worcester. The road to the right at Hartlebury passed through Kidderminster, and so on to Bridgnorth.

&lt;br/&gt;(4.) The road crossing the Severn at Worcester, and going by Kenswick, Martley, crossing the Teme at Ham Bridge, through Clifton-on-Teme to Tenbury, and then into Shropshire. On this road is the Tenbury Bridge over the Teme. When this was damaged in 1615, the town of Tenbury asked the Sessions to help to repair it, as it was "the great thoroughfare from most places in Wales to the City of London."

&lt;br/&gt;(5.) The road from Worcester crossing the Severn, proceeding by Cotheridge, Broadwas, across the Teme at Knightsford Bridge, and so on to Bromyard, thence to Hereford and Wales. Along this road the troops sent with Lord Stamford to occupy Hereford in 1642 returned, and Charles I marched along it to relieve Hereford in 1645.

&lt;br/&gt;(6.) The road from Worcester going south along the east bank of the river (the Bath) road, passing through Kempsey, Severn Stoke, to Tewkesbury and Gloucester. It was along this road Waller advanced to attack Worcester in 1643.

&lt;br/&gt;There were other important roads, but they were more of local importance, or else served as alternative routes.

'''Worthington Hall''', now known as the '''Shawnee Playhouse''', was a historic [[theatre]] located in [[Smithfield Township, Monroe County, Pennsylvania|Smithfield Township]], [[Monroe County, Pennsylvania]]. It was built in 1904.&lt;ref name="shawnee"&gt;[http://www.theshawneeplayhouse.com/history.htm Shawnee Playhouse History &amp; Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; It was delisted in 1986 after being demolished following a fire—caused by arson—on June 24, 1985.&lt;ref name="shawnee"/&gt; With help from the people of [[Shawnee on Delaware]], the Seabees, the Hughes Foundation, the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], [[The National Trust]], a [[Community Development Block Grant]], and generous donations from many individuals and friends, the playhouse was rebuilt.
