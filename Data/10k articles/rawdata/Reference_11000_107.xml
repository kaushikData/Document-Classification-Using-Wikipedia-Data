'''''A Hereditary Book on the Art of War''''' or '''''Heihō kadensho''''' (兵法家伝書), is a Japanese text on the theory and practice of [[swordsmanship]] and strategy, written by the [[samurai]] [[Yagyū Munenori]] in 1632.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54541520|title=The life-giving sword = Heihō kadensho : secret teachings from the house of the Shogun : the classic text on Zen and the No-Sword by Musashi's great rival|last=1571-1646,|first=Yagyū, Munenori,|last2=1571-1646,|first2=柳生宗矩,|date=2003|publisher=Kodansha International|others=Wilson, Scott William, 1944-|isbn=4770029551|edition= 1st|location=Tokyo|oclc=54541520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside [[Miyamoto Musashi]]'s ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/183881541|title=The book of five rings|last=Musashi|first=Miyamoto|date=|publisher=Shambhala|others=Cleary, Thomas F, 1993, 2005|year=|isbn=9781590302484|location=Boston|pages=|oclc=183881541}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is one of the preeminent treatises on warfare in classical Japanese literature. Similar to Musashi's contemporary work, Munenori's has garnered appeal for its applicability beyond the warrior paradigm.

==Content==
The book is divided into three chapters.“The Killing Sword” addresses force as a remedy to disorder and violence. The following “Life-Giving Sword” considers the role of prevention in conflict. Finally, in “No Sword”, the merits of using the environment's resources to one's fullest advantage are explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.suntzutheartofwar.net/library/the-art-of-war-from-japan/a-hereditary-book-on-the-art-of-war-yagyu-munenori/|title=A Hereditary Book On The Art Of War – Yagyū Munenori|last=|first=|date=|website=suntzutheartofwar.net|archive-url=|archive-date=November 30, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;No Sword
This chapter discusses strategies like how higher ground can give an advantage over your foes and how to use inclement weather to your advantage. There are several mentions of how uneven terrain can make all the difference in battle and how a simple thing like a loose stone can turn the table on your enemy.

The site contains images, [[animation]]s, and video for classroom and outreach learning in the [[Animal science|Animal Sciences]]. Each file in the gallery has passed at least two [[peer review]]s to optimize the image and its [[metadata]], and to ensure that the information is sufficient and accurate. The gallery is searchable via keywords or teachers can browse by subject, download images at no cost, and use them freely for educational purposes.

Harold Hafs ([[Rutgers University]]) is the founding Editor-in-Chief. The [[American Society of Animal Science]] oversees the peer reviews required of new submissions, and the USDA [[National Agricultural Library]] manages the gallery website and the holdings after they are accepted.

The Animal Science Image Gallery began as a partnership between the Animal Science Education Consortium (fifteen colleges and universities in the northeast and mid-Atlantic states) and the [[National Agriculture Library]] (NAL), funded (2003-2007) by a USDA Higher Education Challenge Grant. Members of the American Society of Animal Science (ASAS), the [[American Dairy Science Association]], the [[Poultry Science Association]], the Equine Science Society, the American College of Theriogenologists and the Society for the Study of Reproduction have served as editors, reviewers, and submitters. In 2007, ASAS assumed responsibility for oversight of new submissions to the Gallery while the NAL will host the gallery in perpetuity.

'''''Artnell Company v. Commissioner''''', 400 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] 981 (7th Cir. 1968)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Artnell Company v. Commissioner |vol=400 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=981 |pinpoint= |court=7th Cir. |date=1968 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/400/981/207/ |accessdate=2017-11-27 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a decision by the [[7th Circuit Court of Appeals]], in which the court, distinguishing from the holding in ''[[Schlude v. Commissioner]]''&lt;ref name="Schlude"&gt;{{ussc|name=Schlude v. Commissioner|link=|volume=372|page=128|pin=|year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;, held that accrual method taxpayers are not required to include prepayments in gross income when there is certainty as to when performance would occur.

== Facts ==

The petitioner, an accrual method taxpayer, operated the [[Chicago White Sox]] professional baseball franchise using a [[fiscal year]] for [[federal income tax]] purposes. During the 1962 taxable year, the club sold single and season tickets to games to be played during the 1963 taxable year. The petitioner failed to report income from the sales on its 1962 return and instead reported the receipts as income in 1963.

The petitioner's decision to include income from its ticket sales in 1963, rather than 1962, was part of their practice of reporting income from ticket sales as the corresponding games were played.

The Commissioner argued that, in light of ''[[Schlude v. Commissioner]]''&lt;ref name="Schlude"/&gt;, the income should have been reported in the year in which the payment was received, the 1962 taxable year.

== Issue ==

Must the taxpayer include in gross income for 1962 the sale of proceeds received from tickets allocable to games to be played in 1963?

== Holding ==

No. Despite the general rule that requires [[accrual method]] taxpayers to include advance payments in the year of receipt, the court carved out a narrow exception for taxpayers such as the petitioners, who are able to prove that services will be performed on fixed dates in one or more subsequent taxable years.

== Rationale ==

Generally, accrual method taxpayers include income in taxable year it is earned, rather than when it is received. However, the Supreme Court trilogy&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=American Automobile Ass'n v. United States|link=|volume=367|page=687|pin=|year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; ending with ''Schlude''&lt;ref name="Schlude"/&gt; required inclusion of prepayments in gross income because of the uncertainties as to when, or if, performance would occur. The court distinguished the facts of Artnell from this holding and found that the uncertainties present in previous cases that required the inclusion of advance payments in the year of receipt were not present. The Court found that the deferred income was attributable to games that were intended to be played on a fixed schedule and that notwithstanding rain delays there was certainty about when services would be performed. The court reasoned that there are some situations where deferral will so clearly reflect income, that the IRS abuses its discretion when it refuses to permit deferral.

An '''audio tour''' or '''audio guide''' provides a [[Sound recording|recorded]] spoken commentary, normally through a [[handheld device]], to a [[visitor attraction]] such as a [[museum]]. They are also available for [[self-guided tour]]s of outdoor locations,&lt;ref&gt;As employed in the gardens of [[Blenheim Palace]], [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]]&lt;/ref&gt; or as a part of an organised tour. It provides background, context, and information on the things being viewed.&lt;ref name="fisher-p49"&gt;Fisher (2004), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Audio guides are often in multilingual versions and can be made available in different ways. Some of the more elaborate tours may include original music and interviews.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.citylisten.com/our_tours/detail/2/new_york_city/17/walkin_broadway/ Walkin' Broadway from CityListen Audio Tours includes several original interviews with notable Broadway artists and producers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205124335/https://www.citylisten.com/our_tours/detail/2/new_york_city/17/walkin_broadway/ |date=February 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally rented on the spot, more recently downloaded from the [[Internet]] or available via the mobile phone network. Some audio guides are free or included in the entrance fee, others have to be purchased separately.

==History==
[[Willem Sandberg]], director of the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]] from 1945 to 1962, pioneered the world's first museum audio tours. When invented in 1952, the developers were drawn by its unique potential to mediate an experience individually controllable by each visitor, which was content rich, was personal to them, was available at any time, and suited learning styles not served by catalog, text panel, or label. 

Sandberg's ambulatory lectures were delivered through a closed-circuit [[shortwave radio]] broadcasting system in which the amplified audio output of an analog playback tape recorder served as a broadcast station, and transmission was via a loop aerial fixed around the gallery or galleries. Identical lectures in Dutch, French, English, and German were recorded onto magnetic tapes, broadcast in turn through the aerial, and picked up by visitors through a portable [[radio receiver]] with [[headphones]], when inside the loop.  

The system was such that all visitors with a receiver could only hear a specific piece of commentary at any time; hence, groups of visitors would move through the [[Art museum|galleries]] and look at [[exhibits]] as if guided by an invisible force, in complete synchronicity. &lt;ref&gt;''Digital Technologies and the Museum Experience'' (2008), EDITED BY LOÏC TALLON AND KEVIN WALKER. Altamira Press. Pages x, xiii, xvii, xxii {{ISBN|978-0-7591-1119-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic multimedia guides==
[[File:Louvre Audio tour for Korean.jpg|thumb|Audio guide set for [[Louvre]] tour supporting [[Korean language]].]]
A multimedia electronic guide is a device specially designed to provide audio, visual or textual content to museum visitors with or without user interaction. It may also provide alternative content corresponding to different personal preferences. It may include accessories such as [[headphones]], a [[digital pen]] and displays with [[LED]]s or [[LCD]] screens.

These smart guides may be operated to supply content in different languages and accents, with different voice alternatives, with text, and with [[Demographic profile|age group]] specific content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.bartneck.de/publications/2007/museumGuideInRealUse/index.html |title = An Electronic Museum Guide In Use|last1 = Bartneck|first1 = Christopher |last2 = Masuoka|first2 = Aya|last3 = Takahashi|first3 = Toru|last4 = Fukaya|first4 = Takugo| date = 2007|journal = Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|volume = 1|issue = 2|doi =  10.1037/1931-3896.1.2.114|isbn = 0-7695-2385-4|pages = 53-55}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be operated in several ways:

* Touch/push-button systems are operated by the visitor. The visitor enters the code assigned to the object to the electronic museum guide and the related content is provided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/1931-3896.S.1.18 The Learning Experience With Electronic Museum Guides].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Location aware systems operate semi-automatically. They sense the location by several alternative technologies and provide the related content. If the sensing area is not narrow enough to detect every different object then the visitor will enter or select the content he or she wants. Location aware systems provides better quality tours to disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rehab-www.eng.cam.ac.uk/cwuaat/04/34-pat-cmc-knapp-revision.pdf Accessible Design of a Portable Electronic Museum Guide for Universal Access] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628101110/http://rehab-www.eng.cam.ac.uk/cwuaat/04/34-pat-cmc-knapp-revision.pdf |date=June 28, 2007 }}, [[University of Cambridge]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Line-of-sight propagation|Line of Sight]] Aware Systems operate automatically. They sense the location and the target object and provides the related content. These systems may include software that will attempt to measure the visitor's aims and interest areas and may provide shallower or deeper information for the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/WMTE.2005.8 |title = Affective Aware Museum Guide|author = Kuderna-Iulian Benta|publisher = IEEE|doi= 10.1109/WMTE.2005.8|work = Wireless and Mobile Technologies in Education, IEEE International Workshop on|date = 2005|location = Tokushima, Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems may need special technologies for target detection.

A '''cell phone tour''' is an audio tour where pre-recorded or stream audio interpretation for a heritage site or a cultural exhibit is provided via a [[cell phone]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Neuhauser, [http://historicsites.wordpress.com/2008/07/03/cells-and-sites-how-historic-sites-are-using-cell-phone-tours/ Cells and Sites: How Historic Sites are Using Cell Phone Tours] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221203520/http://historicsites.wordpress.com/2008/07/03/cells-and-sites-how-historic-sites-are-using-cell-phone-tours/ |date=February 21, 2010 }}, [http://historicsites.wordpress.com/ National Trust Historic Sites Blog] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215121545/http://historicsites.wordpress.com/ |date=December 15, 2009 }}, July 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Cell phone audio tours have the advantage that most visitors already have the equipment needed to take the audio tour, being their cell phones.

Each venue is assigned a phone number with appropriate stop numbers, displayed next the exhibit. Once a visitor has dialed in, they will be prompted and can enter the corresponding stop number of the exhibit they’re viewing, to hear the recorded content. These tours also enable the visitors to: fast forward, rewind, pause, as well as leave a [[feedback]] message for each exhibit or the whole tour; simply by pressing a number. In addition to audio content, some providers are also able to stream video, and [[text message]] recent visitors with updates {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. This is the old-style approach, not used widely.

==Smart phone tours==
[[Smart phone]]s have significant advantages over cell phones, as they have story-triggering technologies ([[GPS]], [[bluetooth]], [[Near-field communication|NFC]], [[QR-code]] scanner) and can use the power of mobile apps to deliver the right story in the right language in the right place and in the right context (e.g. the evening tour, or a winter tour). Stories could be adjusted to the pace and mood of the user. Of course, such guided tours will use other types of content, above audio: photo, texts, video, quests. Such apps can work online and offline. 

Smart phone tours could guide the user outdoor (streets, highways, zoos, parks, archaeological sites) and indoor (museums), using different guiding techniques. 

There are hundreds apps available on the market, for cities and museums. 

Like it happens with any other type of content (e.g. Youtube in video), development of smart phone guiding apps inevitably led to the launch of so-called "platforms", which aggregate thousands of tours and stories, available for the apps to retell. Examples of such platforms are: izi.TRAVEL, PocketGuide, Guidigo, VoiceMap etc. Some of them, like izi.TRAVEL, are fully free and open. 

The storytelling platforms introduced huge change to several markets:

'''The museum market changes:'''

* Museums can publish guided tours in an hour and change it at any moment. The audio guide is not any more a one-time-off project
* Museums finally own the content they develop (in the age of hardware audio guides museums rarely owned the content)
* Museums can go outside and provide tours for the city
* Museums can cooperate with other cultural institutions
* Museums can invite people form the local communities to help them to develop stories (i.e. leverage the crowdsourcing)
* Museums can finally invade the tourism market and carry on their educational mission on tourists
* With a new voice, with other museums, with crowdsourced projects, with co-operation with tourism and universities, museums can apply for large grants from public funds 

'''The tourism market changes:'''

* Cities can control the tourists traffic, e.g. send tourists away from the city center
* From the other side, the small cities around big ones can get some tourists by providing guided tours
* Cities can enrich the rent-a-bike/boat/car experience with storytelling
* Cities may help tourists to "feel like local" with the help of local communities
* in the city context, museums and story developers can enjoy local businesses to promote their tours and stories for free, as such tours bring extra value for the users of such businesses. E.g. public transport, mobile operators, hotels, rental services are happy to promote the tours in the vicinity. It is called the Storytelling Smart City concept

'''The educational market changes:'''

* Tourists are not "sources of revenue" any more. They are subject for education as they travel
* Universities and schools are developing hundreds of guided tours with open and free platforms

'''The public grant market changes:'''

* For a decade (from 2007 till 2018) public grants funded museum apps and city apps. Most of such projects are already gone. With mobile platforms public funds can grant only content projects which develop the guided tours for any open and free platform
* Public funds accept the slogan "Your content should outlive any technology"

'''The modern technology implications:'''

* Self driving cars introduce an opportunity to make mobile storytelling a part of car infotainment system. Passengers will get stories on the roads (presumably for free), and those stories will be 
* Personal assistant apps like Apple Siri or Google Assistant will use location based stories as well. Being the audio-based apps, such assistants do need audio based and location based content.  Development of "storytelling capacity" for Voice Assistants will be a powerful driver for raising public interest to Mobile Storytelling and attract more storytellers and funds.

'''Banburismus''' was a [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic]] process developed by [[Alan Turing]] at [[Bletchley Park]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the [[Second World War]]. It was used by Bletchley Park's [[Hut 8]] to help break German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (naval) messages enciphered on [[Enigma machine]]s. The process used [[Sequential analysis|sequential]] [[conditional probability]] to infer information about the likely settings of the Enigma machine.&lt;ref&gt;Although this method is frequently stated to be an example of [[Bayesian inference]], Donald Gilles has argued ({{Citation | last = Gilles | first = Donald | year = 1990 | title = The Turing-Good Weight of Evidence Function and Popper's Measure of the Severity of a Test | periodical = Br. J. Phil. Sci. | volume = 41 | pages = 143–146 }}), that the process is not really Bayesian, but rather [[Karl Popper|Popperian]].&lt;/ref&gt; It gave rise to Turing's invention of the ''[[Ban (unit)|ban]]'' as a measure of the weight of evidence in favour of a hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hodges | first = Andrew | author-link = Andrew Hodges | year = 1992 | title = [[Alan Turing: The Enigma]] | publication-place = London | publisher = Vintage | isbn = 978-0-09-911641-7 | page = 197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Good | first = I.J. | authorlink = I.

==Overview==
The aim of Banburismus was to reduce the time required of the electromechanical [[Bombe]] machines by identifying the most likely right-hand and middle [[wheels of the Enigma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Copeland | first = Jack | author-link = Jack Copeland | year = 2004 | contribution = Enigma | editor-last = Copeland | editor-first = B.

J. Good|Good]] (1993) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] was regarded as the best of the Banburists. He and [[I. J. Good]] considered the process more an intellectual game than a job. It was "not easy enough to be trivial, but not difficult enough to cause a nervous breakdown".&lt;ref&gt;[[I. J. Good|Good]] (1993) p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the first few months after arriving at Bletchley Park in September 1939, Alan Turing correctly deduced that the message-settings of Kriegsmarine Enigma signals were enciphered on a common ''Grundstellung'' (starting position of the rotors), and were then super-enciphered with a [[bigram]] and a [[trigram]] lookup table. These trigram tables were in a book called the ''Kenngruppenbuch (K book)''. However, without the bigram tables, Hut 8 were unable to start attacking the traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Alexander]] (''c.'' 1945) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; A breakthrough was achieved after the ''Narvik pinch'' in which the disguised [[Naval trawler|armed trawler]] ''Polares'', which was on its way to [[Narvik]] in [[Norway]], was seized by {{HMS|Griffin|H31|6}} in the [[North Sea]] on 26 April 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Mason | first = Geoffrey B | title = Service Histories of Royal Navy Warships in World War 2 | work = HMS Griffin – G-class Destroyer | date = c. 2004 | url = http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-25G-Griffin.htm | accessdate = 28 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans did not have time to destroy all their cryptographic documents, and the captured material revealed the precise form of the indicating system, supplied the plugboard connections and ''Grundstellung'' for 23 and 24 April and the operators' log, which gave a long stretch of paired plaintext and enciphered message for the 25th and 26th.&lt;ref&gt;Mahon (1945) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The bigram tables themselves were not part of the capture, but Hut 8 were able to use the settings-lists to read retrospectively, all the Kriegsmarine traffic that had been intercepted from 22 to 27 April. This allowed them do a partial reconstruction of the bigram tables and start the first attempt to use Banburismus to attack Kriegsmarine traffic, from 30 April onwards. Eligible days were those where at least 200 messages were received and for which the partial bigram-tables deciphered the [[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicators]]. The first day to be broken was 8 May 1940, thereafter celebrated as "Foss's Day" in honour of [[Hugh Foss]], the cryptanalyst who achieved the feat.

This task took until November that year, by which time the [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] was very out of date, but it did show that Banburismus could work. It also allowed much more of the bigram tables to be reconstructed, which in turn allowed 14 April and 26 June to be broken. However, the Kriegsmarine had changed the bigram tables on 1 July.&lt;ref name = Mahonp26&gt;Mahon (1945) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1940, much of the theory of the Banburismus scoring system had been worked out.

The ''First Lofoten pinch'' from the trawler ''Krebs'' on 3 March 1941 provided the complete keys for February – but no bigram tables or ''K book''. The consequent decrypts allowed the statistical scoring system to be refined so that Banburismus could become the standard procedure against Kriegsmarine Enigma until mid-1943.&lt;ref name = Mahonp26/&gt;

==Principles==
Banburismus utilised a weakness in the indicator procedure (the encrypted message settings) of Kriegsmarine Enigma traffic. Unlike the German Army and Airforce [[Enigma procedures]], the Kriegsmarine used a ''Grundstellung'' provided by key lists, and so it was the same for all messages on a particular day (or pair of days). This meant that the three-letter indicators were all enciphered with the same rotor settings so that they were all ''in depth'' with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Churchhouse | first = R. F. | title = Codes and ciphers: Julius Caesar, the Enigma, and the internet | publisher = Publisher Cambridge University Press | year = 2002 | location = Cambridge | page = 34 | isbn = 0-521-00890-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, the indicators for two messages were never the same, but it could happen that, part-way through a message, the rotor positions became the same as the starting position of the rotors for another message, the parts of the two messages that overlapped in this way were in depth.

[[File:Part_of_a_Banbury_Sheet_as_used_in_Banburismus.jpg|thumb|The left hand end of a "Banbury Sheet" from World War II found in 2014 in the roof space of [[Hut 6]] at [[Bletchley Park]].]] 
The principle behind Banburismus is relatively simple (and seems to be rather similar to the [[Index of Coincidence]]). If two sentences in English or German are written down one above the other, and a count is made of how often a letter in one message is the same as the corresponding letter in the other message; there will be more matches than would occur if the sentences were random strings of letters. For a random sequence, the repeat rate for single letters is expected to be 1 in 26 (around 3.8%), and for the German Navy messages it was shown to be 1 in 17 (5.9%).&lt;ref&gt;[[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Alexander]] (''c.'' 1945) p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; If the two messages were in depth, then the matches occur just as they did in the plaintexts. However, if the messages were not in depth, then the two ciphertexts will compare as if they were random, giving a repeat rate of about 1 in 26. This allows an attacker to take two messages whose indicators differ only in the third character, and slide them against each other looking for the giveaway repeat pattern that shows where they align in depth.

The comparison of two messages to look for repeats was made easier by punching the messages onto thin cards about 250&amp;nbsp;mm high (10") by several metres wide (they had different cards for different lengths of message). A hole at the top of a column on the card represented an 'A' at that position, a hole at the bottom represented a 'Z'. The two message-cards were laid on top of each other on a light-box and where the light shone through, there was a repeat. This made it much simpler to detect and count the repeats. The cards were printed in [[Banbury]] in Oxfordshire. They became known as 'banburies' at Bletchley Park, and hence the procedure using them: Banburismus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Sale | first = Tony | authorlink = Anthony Sale | title = Banburismus | work = The 1944 Bletchley Park Cryptographic Dictionary | publisher = The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/cryptdict/page05.htm | accessdate = 15 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of the scritchmus procedure (see below) gives a clue as to the possible right-hand rotor.

===Example===
Message with indicator "&lt;tt&gt;VFG&lt;/tt&gt;": &lt;tt&gt;XCYBGDSLVWBDJLKWIPEHVYGQZWDTHRQXIKEESQSSPZXARIXEABQIRUCKHGWUEBPF&lt;/tt&gt;

Message with indicator "&lt;tt&gt;VFX&lt;/tt&gt;":
&lt;tt&gt;YNSCFCCPVIPEMSGIZWFLHESCIYSPVRXMCFQAXVXDVUQILBJUABNLKMKDJMENUNQ&lt;/tt&gt;

Hut 8 would punch these onto banburies and count the repeats for all valid offsets −25 letters to +25 letters. There are two promising positions:
&lt;pre&gt;
XCYBGDSLVWBDJLKWIPEHVYGQZWDTHRQXIKEESQSSPZXARIXEABQIRUCKHGWUEBPF
        YNSCFCCPVIPEMSGIZWFLHESCIYSPVRXMCFQAXVXDVUQILBJUABNLKMKDJMENUNQ
                      - --  -   -          -  -   --
&lt;/pre&gt;
This offset of eight letters shows nine repeats, including two bigrams, in an overlap of 56 letters (16%).

The other promising position looks like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
XCYBGDSLVWBDJLKWIPEHVYGQZWDTHRQXIKEESQSSPZXARIXEABQIRUCKHGWUEBPF
       YNSCFCCPVIPEMSGIZWFLHESCIYSPVRXMCFQAXVXDVUQILBJUABNLKMKDJMENUNQ
                ---
&lt;/pre&gt;
This offset of seven shows just a single trigram in an overlap of 57 letters.

Turing's method of accumulating a score of a number of decibans allows the calculation of which of these situations is most likely to represent messages in depth. As might be expected, the former is the winner with odds of 5:1 on, the latter is only 2:1 on.&lt;ref&gt;Hosgood (2008) 2.3 Searching for "Evidence"&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing calculated the scores for the number of single repeats in overlaps of so many letters, and the number of bigrams and trigrams. Tetragrams often represented German word in the plaintext and their scores were calculated according to the type of message (from traffic analysis), and even their position within the message.&lt;ref&gt;Hosgood (2008) 4.2.2 Message Categories&lt;/ref&gt; These were tabulated and the relevant values summed by Banburists in assessing pairs of messages to see which were likely to be in depth.

Bletchley Park used the convention that the indicator plaintext of "VFX", being eight characters ahead of "VFG", or (in terms of just the third, differing, letter) that "X = G+8".

===Scritchmus===
Scritchmus was the part of the Banburismus procedure that could lead to the identification of the right-hand (fast) wheel. The Banburist might have evidence from various message-pairs (with only the third indicator letter differing) showing that "X = Q−2", "H = X−4" and "B = G+3". He&lt;ref&gt;[[Joan Clarke]] worked as a Banburist. {{Cite web | last = Lord | first = Lynsey Ann | title = Joan Elisabeth Lowther Clarke Murray | work = honours project | publisher = University of St Andrews | year = 2008 | url = http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Printonly/Clarke_Joan.html | accessdate = 16 November 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110607183723/http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Printonly/Clarke_Joan.html | archivedate = 7 June 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; would search the deciban sheets for all distances with odds of better than 1:1 (i.e. with scores ≥ +34). An attempt was then made to construct the 'end wheel alphabet' by forming 'chains' of end-wheel letters out of these repeats.&lt;ref&gt;
Hosgood (2008) 7.0 Scritchmus
&lt;/ref&gt;
They could then construct a "chain" as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
G--B-H---X-Q
&lt;/pre&gt;
If this is then compared at progressive offsets with the known letter-sequence of an Enigma rotor, quite a few possibilities are discounted due to violating either the "reciprocal" property or the "no-self-ciphering" property of the Enigma machine:
&lt;pre&gt;
G--B-H---X-Q

-B-H---X-Q              G-&gt;
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ  ......... is impossible (B enciphers to B)

--B-H---X-Q              G-&gt;
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ  ......... is possible
&lt;/pre&gt;

The so-called "end-wheel alphabet" is already limited to just nine possibilities, merely by establishing a letter-chain of five letters derived from a mere four message-pairs. Hut 8 would now try fitting other letter-chains — ones with no letters in common with the first chain — into these nine candidate end-wheel alphabets.

Eventually they will hope to be left with just one candidate, maybe looking like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
         NUP
F----A--D---O
--X-Q              G--B-H-&gt;
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
&lt;/pre&gt;

Not only this, but such an end-wheel alphabet forces the conclusion that the end wheel is in fact "Rotor I". This is because "Rotor II" would have caused a mid-wheel turnover as it stepped from "E" to "F", yet that's in the middle of the span of the letter-chain "F----A--D---O". Likewise, all the other possible mid-wheel turnovers are precluded. Rotor I does its turnover between "Q" and "R", and that's the only part of the alphabet not spanned by a chain.

That the different Enigma wheels had different turnover points was, presumably, a measure by the designers of the machine to improve its security. However, this very complication allowed Bletchley Park to deduce the identity of the end wheel.

==Middle wheel==
Once the end wheel is identified, these same principles can be extended to handle the middle rotor, though with the added complexity that the search is for overlaps in message-pairs sharing just the first indicator letter, and that the overlaps could therefore occur at up to 650 characters apart.&lt;ref&gt;Hosgood (2008) 6.0 The Middle-Wheel alphabet&lt;/ref&gt;

The workload of doing this is beyond manual labour, so BP punched the messages onto 80-column cards and used [[Tabulating machine|Hollerith machines]] to scan for tetragram repeats or better. That told them which banburies to set up on the light boxes (and with what overlap) to evaluate the whole repeat pattern.

Armed with a set of probable mid-wheel overlaps, Hut 8 could compose letter-chains for the middle wheel much in the same way as was illustrated above for the end wheel. That in turn (after Scritchmus) would give at least a partial middle wheel alphabet, and hopefully at least some of the possible choices of rotor for the middle wheel could be eliminated from turnover knowledge (as was done in identifying the end wheel).

Taken together, the probable right hand and middle wheels would give a set of bombe runs for the day, that would be significantly reduced from the 336 possible.

'''Brown v Brown''' [1980] 1 NZLR 484 is a frequently cited case involving the modifying of restraint of trade clauses.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Brothers Robert and Leonard Brown ran an oil drilling business together until they had a falling out, which resulted in Robert buying out Leonard's share of the business. Part of the sale agreement was that Leonard agreed to a restraint of trade, that meant he could not compete as a well driller anywhere in New Zealand, for the next 20 years. That was in 1968.

Years later, Leonard decided to reenter the well drilling business with his sons.

Robert tried to enforce the 20 years restraint of trade clause.

==Decision==
The Court of Appeal ruled that the restraint of trade was unreasonable in both the area and the time period, as Robert was unable to provide any evidence to support the need for these to protect his business.

Accordingly, the court modified the restraint of trade by reducing the area to the northern part of the North Island, as well as reducing the length to 12 years.

McMullin J stated "The first respondent's evidence was that he wanted to keep the appellant out of the industry for the rest of his life. That, I think, is the only explanation for a covenant of such a length."

The '''''Cangjiepian''''', also known as the '''''Three Chapters''''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|三|倉}}}}, ''Sancang''), was a {{circa|lk=no|220}} BCE Chinese [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] and a prototype for [[Chinese dictionary|Chinese dictionaries]]. [[Li Si]], [[Chinese chancellor|Chancellor]] of the [[Qin dynasty]] (221-206 BCE), compiled it for the purpose of [[language reform|reforming]] [[written Chinese]] into the new [[Orthography|orthographic]] standard [[Small Seal Script]]. Beginning in the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE-221 CE), many scholars and lexicographers expanded and annotated the ''Cangjiepian''. By the end of the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907), it had become a [[lost work]], but in 1977, archeologists discovered a cache of (c. 165 BCE) texts written on [[bamboo strips]], including fragments of the ''Cangjiepian''.

==Title==
The eponymous ''Cangjiepian'' title derives from the culture hero [[Cangjie]], the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]]'s historian and inventor of [[Chinese writing]]. According to [[Chinese mythology]], Cangjie, who had four eyes and remarkable cognizance, created Chinese characters after observing natural phenomena such as the footprints of birds and animals (Yang et al. 2008: 84-86). In [[Modern Standard Chinese]] usage, the [[Cangjie method]] of [[Chinese input methods for computers|inputting characters into a computer]] is more common than with the ancient ''Cangjiepian'' proto-dictionary.

In the name Cāngjié or Cāng Jié, ''cāng'' 倉/仓 means "storehouse; warehouse" and is sometimes written 蒼/苍 "dark green; blue; gray; ashy", which is a common [[Chinese surname]]. The character 頡/颉 is only pronounced ''jié'' in this name, and is usually pronounced ''xié'' "stretch the neck; fly up (of birds)".

The ''piān'' 篇 in ''Cangjiepian'' originally meant "[[bamboo strips]] used for writing (before the invention of paper)", which was semantically extended to "sheet (of paper/etc.); piece of writing; article; chapter; section; book". The sinologists [[Li Feng (sinologist)|Li Feng]] and David Branner (2011: 217) describe ''pian'' as "separate textual unit". The original ''Cangjiepian'', like most Qin and Han era books, was written on bamboo and wood strips.

==History==
In the traditional history of Chinese lexicography, the first proto-dictionary primers were the [[Eastern Zhou dynasty]] ''[[Shizhoupian]]'' "Historian Zhou's Chapters", the [[Qin dynasty]] ''Cangjiepian'', and the [[Han dynasty]] ''[[Jijiupian]]''. The Chinese lexicographers Heming Yong and Jing Peng (2008: 34) say these texts that arranged characters into categories "acted as the catalyst for the birth of ancient Chinese dictionaries".

During the [[Warring States period]] (475-221 BCE), there was a wide and confusing variety of unstandardized [[Large Seal Script]] characters, with the same word being written in several different ways. After Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] had conquered all other Warring States and [[Qin's wars of unification|unified China]] in 221 BCE, he adopted a language-reform proposal made by the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]] Li Si and promulgated a decree of ''Shutongwen'' 書同文 "Writing the Same Character". It mandated using a consistent writing system based on the [[Small Seal Script]], which was comparatively simpler and easier to write than Large Seal Script (Yong and Peng 2008: 18). In a logographic language like Chinese, correct character writing is fundamental for efficiency of information transfer.

The emperor ordered his chancellor and two other ministers to compile a standard Small Seal character wordbook in three parts. The 7-chapter ''Cangjiepian'' compilation was overseen by Li Si, the 6-chapter ''Yuanlipian'' 爰歷篇 "Explanation of Difficult Words" by [[Zhao Gao]], and the 7-chapter ''Boxuepian'' 博學篇 "Extensive Knowledge of Words" by Humu Jing 胡毋敬 (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 197). They simplified, standardized, and disseminated a national standard script for the first time in China (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 199). These three textbooks were officially issued and circulated during the short-lived Qin dynasty (221-206 BCE) (Hayhoe 1992: 28, Greatrex 1994:101).

Scholars in the early [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE-220 CE) combined these three Qin texts into one book, and transcribed the original Small Seal script into the standard Han [[Clerical script]]. [[Ban Gu]]'s ''[[Book of Han]]'' records, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;the teachers and learned people in the towns and villages combined ''The Cangjie Primer'', ''The Yuanli Primer'', and ''The Scholarly Primer'' [i.e., ''Boxuepian''] under one cover and segmented the book into fifty-five chapters, each chapter containing sixty characters. This new textbook retained the original title ''The Cangjie Primer''. (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 52) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This 3,300-character ''Cangjiepian'', commonly called the ''Sancang'' 三倉 "Three Cangs", became popular and was widely recognized as the standard textbook for character learning (Yong and Peng 2008: 34-35). Scribes at the beginning of the Han were expected to be able to recite 5,000 characters, which is more than the original ''Cangjiepian'' (Feng and Branner 2011: 351).

The ''Book of the Han'' (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 28) further says that about 60 BCE, during the reign of [[Emperor Xuan of Han]] (r. 74-49 BCE), the ''Cangjiepian'' was "filled with obsolete characters that are difficult for ordinary teachers to read". The emperor called for scholars who could pronounce them correctly, and [[Zhang Chang (Han)|Zhang Chang]] was chosen. After he died in 48 BCE, his grandson-in-law Du Lin 杜林 completed the ''Collections of Cangjie Exegesis'' (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 101), which was lost by the [[Sui dynasty]] (518-618) (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 199).

The ''Cangjiepian'' had a serious pedagogical shortcoming: some Chinese characters could only be understood with the help of specialized annotations, and many came forth (Yong and Peng 2008: 35). The Han philosopher and philologist [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]] (53 BCE–18 CE) first revised the ''Cangjiepian'' and wrote the ''Cangjiexunzuan'' 倉頡訓纂 ''Collections of Cangjie Exegesis'' supplement, which had 5,340 characters (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 47, 81). In the reign of [[Emperor He of Han]] (88-105 CE), Jia Fang 賈魴 compiled another supplement named the ''Pangxipian'' 滂喜篇. 

During the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] (265-420) period, the ''Cangjiepian'', ''Xunzuanpian'', and ''Pangxipian'' were combined into one 3-chapter book with the title ''Cangjiepian'', also called the ''Sancang''. According to the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' (biography of Jiang Shi, tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 215), in the early [[Cao Wei]] dynasty, [[Zhang Yi (Cao Wei)|Zhang Yi]] (fl. 227-232) wrote the ''Picang'' 埤倉 ''The Augmented Cangjie Glossary'', ''[[Guangya]]'' ''The Broad Ready Guide'' {{sic}}, and ''Gujin zigu'' 古今字詁 ''The Exegesis of Ancient and Contemporary Characters''. [[Guo Pu]] (276 – 324) wrote a commentary to the ''Sancang'', which is lost (Yong and Peng 2008: 34).

[[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]]'s ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 101) says that when [[Xu Shen]] started compiling the ''[[Shuowen jiezi]]'', he used ten dictionaries and primers, including the ''Cangjiepian'' (inclusive ''Sancang'' version) ''The Cangjie Primer'', ''Cangjiezhuan'' 倉頡傳 ''The Biography of Cangjie'', both Yang Xiong's and Du Lin's ''Cangjiexunzuan'' 倉頡訓纂 ''Collections of Cangjie Exegesis'', and the ''Cangjiegu'' 倉頡故 ''The Exegesis of the Cangjie Primer''.

The ''Cangjiepian'' was continuously used until the end of the Tang Dynasty, when the last remaining copies were destroyed during the [[Huang Chao|Huang Chao Rebellion]] (874–884). Various [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1912) scholars partially reconstructed the text by collecting fragments quotations of the ''Cangjiepian'' in works such as the ''[[Wen Xuan|Wenxuan]]'' and ''[[Taiping Imperial Reader]]'' (Yong and Peng 2008: 27).

Archeologists have discovered ''Cangjiepian'' fragments in several locations, including the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]] from the [[Mogao Caves]] in [[Gansu]] province, at [[Juyan Lake Basin]] in westernmost [[Inner Mongolia]], and most notably at the [[Shuanggudui]] archeological site, located near [[Fuyang]] in [[Anhui]] province (Wilkinson 2000: 49). In 1977, archeologists excavated a (165 BCE) [[Han dynasty]] tomb at Shuanggudui and discovered a cache of texts written on bamboo strips, including the ''[[Yijing]]'' and ''[[Chuci]]''. The ''Cangjiepian'' version has 541 characters, nearly 20 percent of the complete work, and is longer and more legible than the other fragments; Theobald (2011) provides pictures of these strips. The presence of the ''Cangjiepian'' in several early Han tombs shows that it was, "if not a common manual for elementary instruction, at least not a rare work" (Greatrex 1994:104).

While some academics conclude that the ''Cangjiepian'' "demonstrated the prototype of a modern Chinese dictionary", Yong and Peng (2008: 28) believe this character-learning textbook's format was "not particularly standardized and consistent to the eye of a modern lexicographer". Nevertheless, they admit it is undeniable that the ''Cangjiepian'' "laid a solid foundation and initiated an enlightening start in character standardization, corpus construction, and source material accumulation".

==Text==
The excavated Han dynasty bamboo-slip ''Cangjiepian'' edition has two outstanding features in layout: rhymed 4-character phrases that are easy to recite and remember, and character [[collation]] that is semantically grouped and graphic [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]]-oriented (Yong and Peng 2008: 52)

First, the ''Cangjiepian'' format has rhymed (in Qin period [[Old Chinese]]), 4-character phrases/sentences that are easy for children to recite and memorize. Take the Preface for example,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Cangjie creates characters [*''s-ta'' 書] for educating the young [*''sə.lə-s'' 嗣]. The youth are summoned [*''taw-s'' 詔] and they should learn to be serious, cautious, respectful, and self-disciplined [*''kˤrək-s'' 戒]. They should make up their mind and study hard [*''sə-loŋ-s'' 誦] and show perseverance {{sic}} in reading and reciting day and night [*''trək-s'' 置]. If selected to serve as officials in the government [*''s-rəʔ'' 史], they should be qualified in calculating, accounting, discriminating good from evil, and ruling [*''C.lrə'' 治]. They should be trained to be the elites [*''[ɡ]ur'' 群] and the exceptional but not the deviants [*''ɢək-s'' 異].) (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 53, OC reconstructions from [[Reconstructions_of_Old_Chinese#Baxter.E2.80.93Sagart_.282014.29|Baxter-Sagart 2014]]) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Cangjiepian'' adapted the prevalent style of writing Chinese poetry in 4-character lines, which dates back to the (11th-7th centuries BCE) ''[[Classic of Poetry]]''. Later poetry was composed in 5- and 7-character lines

Some ''Cangjiepian'' passages seem incongruous for a children's primer, for instance (quoted by [[Yan Zhitui]], tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 53), "The Han Dynasty annexes the whole world and all the kingdoms observe its decrees. Its ruling will be like slaughtering the pigs and pulling down the fences. For those kingdoms that disobey, they will be denounced, suppressed, and destroyed".

Second, the ''Cangjiepian'' collated characters on the basis of [[semantic field]]s (already used in the 3rd-century BCE ''[[Erya]]'' dictionary) and graphic radicals (later used in the 121 CE ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''). 

Some sections give characters for words that are [[synonyms]], [[antonyms]], or otherwise semantically related. An example of words meaning "length" (Yong and Peng 2008: 55) is: ''cùn'' 寸 "inch", ''báo'' 薄 "thin", ''hòu'' 厚 "thick", ''guǎng'' 廣 "wide", ''xiá'' 狹 "narrow", ''hǎo'' 好 "good", ''chǒu'' 醜 "ugly", ''cháng'' 長 "long", and ''duǎn'' 短 "short".

Other sections give characters that share a common radical, and furthermore, the sequence of radicals generally resembles the sequence of the 540 radicals in the ''Shuowenjiezi''. For one example (Yong and Peng 2008: 28), the "[[Radical 63|door radical]]" 門 (which is generally used to write words semantically related to "doors") is seen in the sequence ''kāi'' 開 "open", ''bì'' 閉 "close", ''mén'' 門 "door", and ''lǘ'' 閭 "town" all fall under the heading of, for their meanings are all related to the concept of "door". For another, "[[Radical 104|sickness radical]]" 疒 (seen in many characters denoting "illness; sickness") is seen in all but one of the series ''bìng'' 病 "illness", ''kuáng'' 狂 (with the "[[Radical 94|dog radical]]" 犭) "madness", ''cī'' 疵 "blemish", ''gāng'' 疕 "head sores", ''chèn'' 疢 "fever", and ''yáng'' 瘍 "sore". In addition, some ''Cangjiepian'' passages explain semantic extensions and [[polysemy]], such as ""措 means 置 "to handle", also 安 "arrange", and also 施 "implement"" (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 149).

The original ''Cangjiepian'' did not have explanatory notes for difficult characters and words, but some received editions have interpretations and glosses added to characters, which are obviously accretions from scholars of later periods (Yong and Peng 2008: 28). The Tang Dynasty dictionary by Xuan Ying (玄應), the ''[[Yiqiejing yinyi (Xuanying)|Yiqie jing yinyi]]'' "Pronunciation and Meaning in the ''[[Tripitaka]]''" quotes the ''Cangjiepian'' (Yong and Peng 2008: 54) to say, 痏創也 音如鮪魚之鮪, "''Wěi'' 痏 [also pronounced ''yáng'' or ''yòu''] means ''chuàng'' 創 "wound", and is pronounced like the fish ''wěi'' 鮪 "sturgeon"."

On September 11, 1951, an Egyptian newspaper, ''[[al-Ahram]]'', published a [[fatwa]] on whether or not the consumption of the soft drinks [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] were allowed under [[Islamic law]]. The [[mufti]], or Islamic judge, Hasanayn al-Makhluf was the individual who ruled on this matter.&lt;ref&gt;Skovgaard-Petersen, Jakob. Defining Islam for the Egyptian State: Muftis and Fatwas of the Dār Al-Iftā. Leiden: Brill, 1997, 172. &lt;/ref&gt; The reason that this was investigated under Islamic law was because of rumors and conspiracies spreading among the public about these brands. One of these conspiracies was that the [[Coca-Cola logo]], when reflected in a mirror, spelled out "No [[Mohammed]] no [[Mecca]]" in Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Kamdar, Ismail. "Of Wa-Hubbies and Conspiracies." Muslim Matters. March 23, 2011. http://muslimmatters.org/2011/03/23/of-wa-hubbies-and-conspiracies/. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Issuing the fatwa==
Mufti Hasanayn al-Makhluf explained in this fatwa that all foods and drinks are assumed to be permissible under Islamic law unless found otherwise. According to the fatwa, if a person does not know the condition or ingredients of a food or beverage, its consumption is permitted until its nature is determined. Thus, the results of this fatwa would serve to remove the uncertainty regarding the consumption of cola beverages such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi. In order to get an accurate answer on whether or not [[Pepsi]] and [[Coca-Cola]] were prohibited by Islamic law, the [[Department of Fatwas]] collaborated with the [[Ministry of Health (Egypt)|Ministry of Public Health]] in order to ascertain the composition of the two sodas. On August 25, 1951, the Ministry of Public Health wrote to the Department of Fatwas to share their findings. They found that neither Pepsi-Cola nor Coca-Cola had any [[narcotics]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], or [[pepsin]] present in them.&lt;ref&gt; Herbert J. Liebesny, ''The Law of the Near and Middle East Readings, Cases, and Materials'', Albany: [[State University of New York Press]], 1975, 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of narcotics and the consumption of alcohol are both prohibited under Islamic law. Pepsin is created from the membrane of pig stomachs, and any product coming from a pig is not permitted under Muslim [[Sharia law]].&lt;ref&gt; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. "Pepsin from Hog Stomach." 1972. http://www.fao.org/ag/agn/jecfa-additives/specs/Monograph1/Additive-309.pdf. &lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Public Health goes on to explain that the drinks also have no harmful microbes in them. Based on the information provided by the Ministry of Public Health that assured the Department of Fatwas of the lack of narcotics, alcohol, pepsin, and microbes in both Pepsi Cola and Coca-Cola, Hasanayn al-Makhluf declared the drinks to be permissible under Islamic law.&lt;ref&gt; Herbert J. Liebesny The law of the Near and Middle East readings, cases, and materials, Albany: State University of New York Press, 1975, 42-43. &lt;/ref&gt;

They feature heraldic devices and national emblems of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and recent pieces were designed to reflect the monarch's role as [[Head of the Commonwealth]].

Use of regalia by monarchs in England can be traced back to medieval times. A permanent set of coronation regalia, once belonging to [[Edward the Confessor]], was established after he was made a saint in the 12th&amp;nbsp;century. By the [[Tudor period]] it was usual for a monarch to inherit state regalia from his or her predecessor. Most of the present collection as a whole dates from around 350 years ago when [[Charles II of England|Charles&amp;nbsp;II]] ascended the throne. The medieval and Tudor regalia had been either sold or melted down after the monarchy was abolished in 1649, during the [[English Civil War]]. Only four original items pre-date the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]: a late 12th-century anointing spoon, which is the oldest object in the collection, and three early 17th-century swords. Upon the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the English Crown Jewels were adopted by British monarchs; the Scottish regalia are known today as the [[Honours of Scotland]].

The regalia contain 23,578 stones, among them [[Cullinan&amp;nbsp;I]], the largest clear cut diamond in the world at {{convert|530|carat|g}}, set in the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross. It was cut from the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found, the Cullinan Diamond, discovered in South Africa in 1905 and presented to [[Edward&amp;nbsp;VII]]. On the [[Imperial State Crown]] are [[Cullinan&amp;nbsp;II]] (second-largest of the Cullinan diamonds), the [[Stuart Sapphire]], [[St&amp;nbsp;Edward's Sapphire]], and the [[Black Prince's Ruby]]&amp;nbsp;– a large spinel given to [[Edward the Black Prince]] by a Spanish king in 1367. The [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond, originally from India, has featured on three consort crowns. A small number of historical objects at the Tower are either empty or set with glass and crystals.

At a coronation the monarch is anointed using [[Chrism|holy oil]] poured from an [[ampulla]] into the spoon, invested with robes and ornaments, and crowned with [[St&amp;nbsp;Edward's Crown]]. Afterwards, it is exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown, which is also usually worn at [[State Openings of Parliament]]. Wives of kings are invested with a plainer set of regalia,{{efn|Husbands of [[queens regnant]] are not crowned in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Allison and Riddell, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;}} and since 1831 a new crown has been made specially for each [[queen consort]]. Also regarded as Crown Jewels are state swords, trumpets, ceremonial maces, church plate, historical regalia, banqueting plate, and royal christening fonts. When not in use the Jewels are on public display, mainly in the [[Jewel House]], where they are seen by approximately 2.5&amp;nbsp;million visitors every year.

==History==

===Early history===
The earliest known use of a crown in Britain was discovered by archaeologists in 1988 in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]], Kent, and dates to between 200 and 150&amp;nbsp;[[Before Christ|BC]]. A sword, brooch, ceremonial shield, and decorated bronze crown with a single arch,{{efn|British Museum number [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId{{=}}831407&amp;partId{{=}}1 1990,0102.24]}} which sat directly on the head of its wearer, were found inside the tomb of the [[Mill Hill Warrior]].&lt;ref&gt;Keay, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, crowns were symbols of authority worn by religious and military leaders. Priests continued to use crowns following the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] in 43&amp;nbsp;[[Anno Domini|AD]].&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; A dig in a field at [[Hockwold&amp;nbsp;cum&amp;nbsp;Wilton]], Norfolk, in 1957 revealed a bronze crown with two arches and depictions of male faces,{{efn|British Museum number [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId{{=}}3466480&amp;partId{{=}}1 1957,0207.15]}} dating from the period of Roman occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Twining, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Athelstan.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Crude painting of King Athelstan wearing his crown and handing over the book to a haloed Saint Cuthbert. Both men wear medieval robes.|King Æthelstan presenting an illuminated manuscript to St Cuthbert, c. 930]]
By the early 5th&amp;nbsp;century, the Romans had withdrawn from Britain, and the [[Angles]] and the [[Saxons]] settled. A [[heptarchy]] of new kingdoms began to emerge. One of the methods used by regional kings to solidify their authority over their territories was the use of ceremony and insignia.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb of an unknown king&amp;nbsp;– evidence suggests it may be [[Rædwald of East Anglia]]&amp;nbsp;– at [[Sutton Hoo]] provides insight into the regalia of a pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon king.&lt;ref name="barker2529"&gt;Barker, pp. 25–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the early 7th-century tomb discovered in 1939 was found the ornate [[Sutton Hoo helmet]], comprising an iron cap, a neck guard, and a face mask, decorated with images of animals and warriors in copper-alloy and set with [[garnet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=86159&amp;partId=1|title=The Sutton Hoo Helmet|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also buried with a heavy [[sharpening stone|whetstone]] sceptre,{{efn|British Museum number [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId{{=}}88895&amp;partId{{=}}1 1939,1010.160]}} on top of which is an iron ring surmounted by the figure of a stag; a decorated sword; and a ceremonial shield.&lt;ref name="barker2529"/&gt;

In 597, a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monk had been sent by [[Pope Gregory&amp;nbsp;I]] to start converting [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Pagan England]] to Christianity. The monk, [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]], became the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Within two centuries, the ritual of anointing monarchs with holy oil and crowning them (initially with helmets) in a Christian ceremony had been established, and regalia took on a religious identity. There was still no permanent set of coronation regalia; each monarch generally had a new set made that was usually buried with him or her upon death.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, pp. 13–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 9th-century Europe, gold crowns in the [[Byzantine]] tradition were replacing bronze, and gold soon became the standard material for English royal crowns.&lt;ref name="royalgold"&gt;{{cite podcast|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/resources/lecture-podcast-royal-gold-reflections-of-power|title=Royal Gold: Reflections of Power|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|author=Kathryn Jones|date=17 December 2014|access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Æthelstan]] ascended the throne in 924 and united the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to form the [[Kingdom of England]]. In the earliest known depiction of an English king wearing a crown, he is shown [[presentation miniature|presenting a copy]] of [[Bede]]'s ''Life of [[St Cuthbert]]'' to the saint himself.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Until his reign, kings had been portrayed on coins wearing helmets and circlets,&lt;ref name="steane31"&gt;Steane, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; or wreath-like diadems in the style of Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]]. Whether or not they wore such an item is questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Twining, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edgar the Peaceful]] was the first English king to be crowned with an actual crown, and a sceptre was also introduced for his coronation in 973.&lt;ref name="twining103"&gt;Twining, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; After crowns, sceptres were the most potent symbols of royal authority in medieval England.&lt;ref&gt;Steane, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward the Confessor]] is depicted on a throne and wearing a crown and holding a sceptre in the first scene of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinton, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1066, Edward died without an heir, and [[William the Conqueror]] emerged as the first [[House of Normandy|Norman]] king of England following his victory over the English at the [[Battle of Hastings]]. Wearing a crown became an important part of William&amp;nbsp;I's efforts to cement his authority over his new territory and subjects.&lt;ref name="keay1820"&gt;Keay, pp. 18–20.&lt;/ref&gt; At his death in 1087, the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' reported: "[William] kept great state … He wore his crown three times a year as often as he was in England … He was so stern and relentless … we must not forget the good order he kept in the land".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Those crown-wearings were held on the religious festivals of Easter, [[Whitsun]] and Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;Steane, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EdwardConfesor.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A coin-like device embossed with Edward the Confessor sitting on his throne in the centre and an inscription around the border.|First [[great seal]] of the Confessor]]
In 1161, Edward the Confessor was made a saint, and objects connected with his reign became holy relics. The monks at his burial place of [[Westminster Abbey]] claimed that Edward had asked them to look after his regalia in perpetuity and they were to be used at the coronations of all future kings.&lt;ref name="keay1820"/&gt; A note to this effect is contained in an inventory of relics drawn up by a monk at the abbey in 1450, recording a [[tunicle]], [[dalmatic]], [[pallium]], and other vestments; a gold sceptre, two rods, a gold crown, comb, and spoon; for the queen's coronation a crown and two rods; and for the [[Holy Communion]] a [[chalice]] of [[onyx]] stone and a [[paten]] made of gold&amp;nbsp;– all of which were considered precious relics.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, pp. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Abbey's claim is likely to have been an exercise in self-promotion, and some of the regalia had probably been taken from Edward's grave when he was reinterred there, it became accepted as fact,&lt;ref name="keay1820"/&gt; thereby establishing the first known set of hereditary coronation regalia in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Westminster Abbey is owned by a monarch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11795159|title=Profile: Westminster Abbey|website=BBC News|date=23 November 2010|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the regalia had always been royal property – the abbots were mere custodians. In the following centuries, some of these objects would fall out of use and the regalia would expand to include many others used or worn by monarchs and queens consort at coronations.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

A crown referred to as [[St&amp;nbsp;Edward's Crown]] is first recorded as having been used for the coronation of [[Henry III of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;III]] in 1220, and it appears to be the same crown worn by Edward. Being crowned and invested with regalia owned by a previous monarch who was also a saint reinforced the king's authority.&lt;ref name="rose14"&gt;Rose, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also wrongly thought to have been originally owned by [[Alfred the Great]] because an inscription on the lid of its box, translated from Latin, read: "This is the chief crown of the two, with which were crowned Kings Alfred, Edward and others".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The crown would be used in many subsequent coronations until its eventual destruction 400 years later. Few descriptions survive, although one 17th-century historian noted that it was "ancient Work with Flowers, adorn'd with Stones of somewhat a plain setting",&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; and an inventory described it as "gold wire-work set with slight stones and two little bells", weighing {{convert|79.5|oz|kg|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;Twining, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; It had arches and may have been decorated with [[filigree]] and [[cloisonné]] enamels.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the Royal Collection in this period was an item called a [[state crown]]. Together with other crowns, rings, and swords, it comprised the monarch's state regalia that were kept separate from the coronation regalia, mostly at the royal palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Late Middle Ages====

The transferring of crowns symbolised the transfer of power between rulers.  Following the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|defeat in 1282]] of the Welsh prince [[Llewelyn ap Gruffydd]] by [[Edward I of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;I]], the Welsh regalia, including the crown of the legendary [[King Arthur]], were surrendered to England. According to the ''Chronicle of [[Aberconwy Abbey]]'', "and so the glory of Wales and the Welsh was handed over to the kings of England".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[First War of Scottish Independence|invasion of Scotland]] in 1296, the [[Stone of Scone]] was sent to the [[Tower of London]] "in recognition", as the chronicler [[Walter of Guisborough]] put it, "of a kingdom surrendered and conquered".&lt;ref&gt;Breeze, et al., p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; It was fitted into a wooden chair, which came to be used for the investiture of kings of England, earning its reputation as the [[Coronation Chair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/the-coronation-chair|title=The Coronation Chair|publisher=Westminster Abbey|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish regalia were also taken to London and offered at the shrine of Edward the Confessor;&lt;ref&gt;Breeze, et al., p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland eventually regained its independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/the_wars_of_independence/|website=Scotland's History|publisher=BBC Scotland|title=The Wars of Independence|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Edward&amp;nbsp;II]]'s treasury in 1324 there were 10 crowns.&lt;ref&gt;Twining, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Richard&amp;nbsp;II]] was forced to abdicate in 1399, he symbolically handed St&amp;nbsp;Edward's Crown to [[Henry IV of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;IV]], saying "I present and give to you this crown … and all the rights dependent on it".&lt;ref&gt;Steane, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monarchs often pledged various items of state regalia as collateral for loans throughout the Middle Ages. Edward II pawned his Great Crown in [[Flanders]]. Three crowns and other jewels were held by the [[Bishop of London]] and [[Earl of Arundel]] as security for £10,000 in the 1370s.&lt;ref name="steane35"&gt;Steane, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; One crown was handed over to the [[Corporation of London]] in exchange for a £4,000 loan in 1386. Sometimes objects were temporarily released from pawn by mayors, knights, peers, bankers, and other wealthy subjects in both England and continental Europe for the king to use at state occasions, then returned following the ceremony. Kings also distributed plate and jewels to their troops in lieu of money.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point in the 14th&amp;nbsp;century, all of the state regalia were moved to the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] at the Tower of London owing to a series of successful and attempted thefts in Westminster Abbey.{{efn|[[Thomas Frederick Tout]] gives an illuminating second-hand account of one such theft in ''[https://archive.org/details/mediaevalburglar00toutuoft A&amp;nbsp;Mediæval Burglary]'' (1916).}} The holy relics of the coronation regalia stayed behind intact at the Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; After a long absence, two arches topped with a [[monde]] and cross were added to new images of St&amp;nbsp;Edward's Crown by the time of Henry&amp;nbsp;IV and to the state crown during the reign of his successor [[Henry V of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;V]],&lt;ref name="steane35"/&gt; though arches did not feature on the Great Seal until 1471.&lt;ref name="collins11"&gt;Collins, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Known as a closed or [[imperial crown]], the arches and cross symbolised the king's pretensions of being an emperor of his own domain, subservient to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;Dale Hoak in Hoak, "The iconography of the crown imperial", pp. 55, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tudor and early Stuart periods===
The traditions established in the medieval period continued later. By the middle of the 15th&amp;nbsp;century, a crown was formally worn on six religious feasts every year: Christmas, [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], Easter, Whitsun, [[All Saints' Day]], and one or both feasts of St&amp;nbsp;Edward.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Edward the Confessor's feast day was 13 October and [[Edward the Martyr]]'s 18 March.}} A crown was displayed and worn at the annual [[State Opening of Parliament]],&lt;ref&gt;David Dean in Hoak, "Image and ritual in the Tudor parliaments", p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; and three were placed on the heads of monarchs at a coronation: St&amp;nbsp;Edward's Crown, the state crown, and a "rich crown" made specially for the king or queen.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, pp. 731–732.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Elizabeth I in coronation robes.jpg|thumb|left||upright|alt=Coronation portrait of Elizabeth I in a gold robe trimmed with ermine and decorated with silver-coloured Tudor roses. She is wearing a crown and holding a gold sceptre in her right hand and a blue orb in her left, all of which are decorated with gemstones and pearls.|[[Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I]] holding an orb]]
Around this time, three swords&amp;nbsp;– symbols of kingship since ancient times&amp;nbsp;– were being used in the coronation ceremony to represent the king's powers in the administration of justice: the Sword of Spiritual Justice, the Sword of Temporal Justice, and the blunt [[Sword of Mercy]].&lt;ref name="keay30"&gt;Keay, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; An emerging item of regalia was the orb, described in [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] inventories as a round ball with a cross of gold,&lt;ref name="keay32"&gt;Keay, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; which underlined the monarch's sovereignty. Orbs had been pictorial emblems of royal authority in England since the early Middle Ages but a real orb was probably not used at any English coronation until that of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII]] in 1509.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[English Reformation]], the [[Church of England]] denounced the veneration of medieval relics, and starting with the coronation of [[Edward VI of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;VI]] in 1547, the significance of St&amp;nbsp;Edward's regalia was downplayed in the ceremony.&lt;ref name="macgregor257"&gt;Ronald Lightbown in MacGregor, "The King's Regalia, Insignia and Jewellery", p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; 

State regalia increasingly passed from one king to the next. The best known example of this was [[Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII's Crown]]. Its date of manufacture is unknown, but it was probably created at the beginning of the Tudor dynasty, maybe in the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VII]]. The concept of hereditary state regalia was enshrined in English law when [[James I of England|James&amp;nbsp;I]] decreed in 1605: "Roiall and Princely ornaments and Jewells to be indyvidually and inseparably for ever hereafter annexed to the Kingdome of this Realme".&lt;ref name="keay32"/&gt; After James died in 1625, [[Charles I of England|Charles&amp;nbsp;I]] succeeded to the throne. Desperate for money, one of his first acts as king was to load 41 masterpieces from the Jewel House onto a ship bound for [[Amsterdam]] – the hub of Europe's jewel trade. This hoard of unique bejewelled pieces, like the [[Mirror of Great Britain]], a {{convert|4.7|kg|lb|adj=on}} gold salt cellar known as the Morris Dance, and much fine Elizabethan plate, was expected to swell the king's coffers by £300,000, but they fetched £70,000.&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Glanville in Abramova and Dmitrieva, "The Goldsmiths and the Court: Silver in London 1600–65", p. 52; Collins, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles's many conflicts with Parliament, stemming from his belief in the [[divine right of kings]] and the many religious conflicts that pervaded his reign, triggered the [[English Civil War]] in 1642.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament deemed the regalia as "Jewels of the Crown", vested in the monarch because of his public role as king, and not owned by him personally.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid putting his own subjects at risk, Charles and his wife once again raised money by exporting royal jewels at a heavy discount. On learning of the king's scheme, both Houses of Parliament declared traffickers of the Crown Jewels to be [[Enemy of the state|enemies of the state]].&lt;ref&gt;Barker, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Full statement in John Rushworth (1721), [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/rushworth-papers/vol4/pp722-751#p38 ''Historical Collections''], vol. 4, p. 736.}} Just two years later, Parliament seized {{convert|187|kg|lb}} of rare silver-gilt pieces from the Jewel House, which included a royal christening font, and used them to bankroll its own side of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Glanville in Abramova and Dmitrieva, "The Goldsmiths and the Court: Silver in London 1600–65", p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interregnum===
[[File:Crown Henry VII.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Coronation portrait of Charles I standing next to some of his regalia in front of a red drape.|Charles I standing beside Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII's Crown and a gold orb and sceptre, 1631]]
After six years of war, Charles was defeated and executed in 1649. Less than a week after the king's execution, the [[Rump Parliament]] voted to abolish the monarchy. The newly created [[English Republic]] found itself short of money. To raise funds, the Act for the Sale of the Goods and Personal Estate of the Late King, Queen and Prince was brought into law, and trustees were appointed to value the Jewels&amp;nbsp;– then regarded by [[Oliver Cromwell]] as "symbolic of the detestable rule of kings"&lt;ref name="mears6"&gt;Mears, et al., p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and "monuments of superstition and idolatry"&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;– and sell them to the highest bidder. The most valuable object was Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII's Crown, valued at £1,100.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Their gemstones and pearls removed, most of the coronation and state regalia were melted down, and the gold was struck into hundreds of coins by [[Royal Mint|the Mint]].&lt;ref&gt;Keay, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[nuptial crown]]s, the Crown of [[Margaret of York]] and the [[Crown of Princess Blanche]], survived as they had been taken out of England centuries before the Civil War by Margaret and Blanche when they married kings in continental Europe. Both crowns and the 9th-century [[Alfred Jewel]] give a sense of the character of royal jewellery in England in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Another rare survivor is Henry&amp;nbsp;V's 600-year-old [[Crystal Sceptre]], a gift to the Lord Mayor of London, who still bears it at coronations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cityoflondon.gov.uk/henry-vs-crystal-sceptre-displayed-at-guildhall-art-gallery/|title=Henry V's 'Crystal Sceptre' displayed at Guildhall Art Gallery|publisher=City of London|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many pieces of English plate had been presented to visiting dignitaries and can be seen in museums throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Honours of Scotland|Scottish regalia]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles&amp;nbsp;II]], who was crowned King of Scotland in 1651, also survive even though Cromwell made an attempt to seize and destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royal.uk/honours-scotland|title=The Honours of Scotland|publisher=Royal family|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, Cromwell declined invitations by Parliament to be made king and became [[Lord Protector]]. It was marked by a ceremony in [[Westminster Hall]] in 1657, where he donned purple robes, sat on the Coronation Chair, and was invested with many traditional symbols of sovereignty, except a crown.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; A crown perhaps made of gilded base metal, as was typical of funerary crowns in those days, was placed beside Cromwell at his lying in state in 1660.&lt;ref&gt;Barclay, pp. 157–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration to present day===
The [[Restoration (England)|monarchy was restored]] after Cromwell's death, and for the English coronation of Charles&amp;nbsp;II, who had been living in exile abroad,&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p 18.&lt;/ref&gt; new Jewels were made based on records of the lost items.&lt;ref name="mears6"/&gt; They were supplied by the banker and Royal Goldsmith,{{efn|Vyner outsourced work to fellow members of the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths|Goldsmiths' Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Sir&amp;nbsp;[[Sir Robert Vyner, 1st Baronet|Robert Vyner]], at a cost of [[£sd|£12,184 7s 2d]]&lt;ref name="mears6"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– as much as three warships.&lt;ref name="cjfactsheet2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hrpprodsa.blob.core.windows.net/hrp-prod-container/11154/crown_jewels_factsheet_2_2.pdf|title=Crown Jewels factsheet 2|publisher=Historic Royal Palaces|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided to fashion the replicas as much as possible like the medieval regalia and to use the original names. These 22-karat gold objects,&lt;ref name="royalgold"/&gt; made in 1660 and 1661, form the nucleus of the Crown Jewels today: St&amp;nbsp;Edward's Crown, two sceptres, an orb, an ampulla for the holy anointing oil,{{efn|A popular theory that the Ampulla pre-dates the Restoration because of its antiquated style was conclusively rejected in Claude Blair's 1998 history and catalogue raisonné on the Crown Jewels.&lt;ref&gt;Barclay, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;}} a pair of spurs, a pair of [[armill]]s or bracelets, and a walking stick. A medieval silver-gilt anointing spoon and three swords survived and were returned to the Crown,&lt;ref&gt;Dixon-Smith, et al., p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Dutch ambassador arranged the return of extant jewels pawned in Holland.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The king spent additional money on {{convert|2270|kg|lb}} of altar and banqueting plate, and he was presented with conciliatory gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Glanville in Abramova and Dmitrieva, "The Goldsmiths and the Court: Silver in London 1600–65", p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomas Blood's theft of the Crown Jewels.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Black-and-white sketch of Thomas Blood and two of his accomplices stealing objects from the Jewel House. The regalia cupboard is partially open, and a man lies wounded on the floor.|Thomas Blood making his escape, drawn 1793]]
In 1669, the Jewels went on public display for the first time in the [[Jewel House]] at the Tower of London. The Deputy [[Keeper of the Jewel House]] took the regalia out of a cupboard and showed it to visitors for a small fee.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, et al., pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; This informal arrangement was ended two years later when [[Thomas Blood]], an Irish-born army officer loyal to Parliament, attacked the 77-year-old and stole a crown, a sceptre, and an orb. Blood and his three accomplices were apprehended at the castle perimeter, but the crown had been flattened with a mallet in an attempt to conceal it, and there was a dent in the orb.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He was pardoned by the king, who also gave him land and a pension; it has been suggested that Blood was treated leniently because he was a government spy.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since, the Jewels have been protected by armed guards.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Restoration, there have been many additions and alterations to the regalia.{{efn|A comprehensive list of additions and alterations up to the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838 can be found in Jones, pp. 63–72. For a timeline of changes between 1855 and 1967 see Holmes and Sitwell, pp. 76–78. A thorough history is contained in Blair, vol. 2.}} A new set was commissioned in 1685 for [[Mary of Modena]], the first queen consort to be crowned since the Restoration, Charles&amp;nbsp;II having been unmarried when he took the throne. Another, more elaborate set had to be made four years later when [[Mary II of England|Mary&amp;nbsp;II]] was crowned as [[Coregency|joint sovereign]] with her husband [[William III of England|William&amp;nbsp;III]].&lt;ref name="mears6"/&gt; After the [[Acts of Union 1707]] joined England and Scotland together, the Scottish Crown Jewels were locked away in a chest,&lt;ref&gt;Douglas S. Mack in McCracken-Flesher, "Can the Scottish Subaltern Speak? Nonelite Scotland and the Scottish Parliament", p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; and the English Crown Jewels continued to be used by [[British monarchs]]. Gemstones were hired for coronations – the fee typically being 4% of their value – and replaced with [[Rhinestone|paste]] and crystals for display in the Jewel House, a practice that continued until the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="mears6"/&gt;

During World War&amp;nbsp;II, the Crown Jewels were stored in the basement of [[Windsor Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The most valuable gems, such as the Koh-i-Noor and Cullinan diamonds, were sealed in a biscuit tin and hidden beneath a [[sally port]], allowing them to be recovered swiftly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/01/13/as-the-nazis-bombed-britain-the-royals-hid-the-crown-jewels-in-the-least-likely-place/|title=As the Nazis bombed Britain, the royals hid the crown jewels in the least likely place|website=The Washington Post|author=Steve Hendrix|date=13 January 2018|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the Jewels were kept in a vault at the [[Bank of England]] for two years while the Jewel House was repaired as the Tower had been struck by a bomb.&lt;ref&gt;Hennessy, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, St&amp;nbsp;Edward's Crown was placed on the head of Queen [[Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II]] in what is now the only ceremony of its kind in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/TheCrownJewels.aspx|title=Symbols of the Monarchy: The Crown Jewels|author=Royal Household|publisher=British Monarchy website|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309022500/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/TheCrownJewels.aspx|archivedate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, 140 objects make up the Crown Jewels,&lt;ref name="thecoronation"&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC One: The Coronation|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/themes/trails/royal-collection-season-on-the-bbc/bbc-one-the-coronation|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are permanently set with 23,578 precious and semi-precious stones, and they are seen by around 2.5&amp;nbsp;million visitors every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/28/crown-jewels-new-exhibition|title=Crown Jewels go on show for major new exhibition|author1=Maev Kennedy|author2=Katy Roberts|date=28 March 2012|accessdate=26 July 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crowns==
Crowns are the main symbols of royal authority.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; All crowns in the Tower are decorated with alternating [[Cross pattée|crosses pattée]] and [[fleurs-de-lis]], a pattern which first appears on the great seal of [[Richard&amp;nbsp;III]],&lt;ref name="collins11"/&gt; and their arches are surmounted with a [[monde]] and cross pattée. Most of them also have a red or purple velvet cap and an [[ermine]] border.&lt;ref name="inventory"/&gt;

===St Edward's Crown===
&lt;!-- There is a photo of St Edward's Crown in the infobox. --&gt;
The centrepiece of the coronation regalia is named after Edward the Confessor and is placed on the monarch's head at the moment of crowning by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].&lt;ref name="mtm23"&gt;Mears, et al., p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Made of gold and completed in 1661, [[St&amp;nbsp;Edward's Crown]] has two depressed arches on top. It is embellished with 444 stones, including [[amethyst]]s, [[garnet]]s, [[peridot]]s, [[rubies]], [[sapphires]], [[topaz]]es, [[tourmaline]]s and [[zircon]]s.&lt;ref name="stedwardscrown"&gt;{{Royal Collection|31700|St Edward's Crown}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crown was fashioned to closely resemble the medieval one, with a heavy gold base and clusters of semi-precious stones, but the arches are decidedly [[Baroque]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th century, it was assumed to be original, as their weight is almost identical, and an invoice was produced in 1661 for the addition of gold to an existing crown. In 2008, new research found that a [[coronation crown]] had been made in 1660, and it was enhanced when Parliament increased the budget for Charles&amp;nbsp;II's delayed coronation.&lt;ref&gt;Barclay, pp. 150, 151, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; The crown is {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} tall, and at a weight of {{convert|2.23|kg|lb|abbr=on|1}} it has been noted to be extremely heavy.&lt;ref name="stedwardscrown"/&gt; After 1689, monarchs chose to be crowned with a lighter, bespoke coronation crown (e.g., [[Coronation Crown of George IV|that of George&amp;nbsp;IV]]&lt;ref&gt;Dixon-Smith, et al., p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;) or their state crown, while St&amp;nbsp;Edward's Crown usually rested on the high altar. The tradition of using St&amp;nbsp;Edward's Crown was revived in 1911 for the coronation of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George&amp;nbsp;V]].&lt;ref name="mtm23"/&gt; In 1953, Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II opted for a stylised image of this crown to be used on coats of arms, badges, logos and various other insignia in the [[Commonwealth realm]]s to symbolise her royal authority. It replaced the image of [[Tudor Crown (heraldry)|a Tudor-style crown]] adopted in 1901 by [[Edward&amp;nbsp;VII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpc.vic.gov.au/index.php/news-publications/victorian-symbols-emblems/victorian-coat-of-arms|title=Victorian Coat of Arms|publisher=Victoria State Government|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A much lighter crown is worn by the monarch when leaving Westminster Abbey, and at the annual State Opening of Parliament.&lt;ref name="mtm29"&gt;Mears, et al., p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[Imperial State Crown]] was made in 1937 for [[George&amp;nbsp;VI]] and is a copy of the one made in 1838 for [[Queen Victoria]], which had fallen into a poor state of repair,&lt;ref&gt;Keay, pp. 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt; and had been made using gems from its own predecessor, the [[State Crown of George&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref&gt;Dixon-Smith, et al., p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1953, the crown was resized to fit Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II, and the arches were lowered by {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} to give it a more feminine appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The gold, silver and platinum crown is decorated with 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds and 5 rubies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|31701|The Imperial State Crown}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the largest stones are the {{convert|317|carat|g|adj=on|1}} [[Cullinan&amp;nbsp;II]] diamond, also known as the Second Star of Africa, added to the crown in 1909. The {{convert|170|carat|g|adj=on|0}} [[Black Prince's Ruby]], set in the front cross, is a large [[spinel]] given to [[Edward the Black Prince]] by a Spanish king in 1367 and worn by [[Henry V of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;V]] at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in 1415. At the back of the crown is the {{convert|104|carat|g|adj=on|1}} [[Stuart Sapphire]], and in the top cross is [[St&amp;nbsp;Edward's Sapphire]], reputedly taken from the ring of Edward the Confessor when his body was re-interred at the Abbey in 1163.&lt;ref name="mtm30"&gt;Mears, et al., p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Below the monde hang four pearls, three of which are often said to have belonged to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I]], but the association is almost certainly erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon-Smith, et al., p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consort crowns===
After the Restoration, wives of kings&amp;nbsp;– queens consort&amp;nbsp;– traditionally wore the [[Crown of Mary of Modena]], wife of [[James II of England|James&amp;nbsp;II]], who first wore it at their coronation in 1685. Originally set with 561 hired diamonds and 129 pearls, it is now set with crystals and cultured pearls for display in the Jewel House along with a matching diadem that consorts wore in procession to the Abbey. The diadem once held 177 diamonds, 1 ruby, 1 sapphire, and 1 emerald.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, et al., p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, the crown was judged to be too theatrical and in a poor state of repair, so the [[Crown of Queen Adelaide]] was made for the wife of [[William IV of England|William&amp;nbsp;IV]] to wear in 1831 using gemstones from her own collection of jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Queen Mary's Crown.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=Art Deco crown covered in diamonds of all shapes and sizes|Queen Mary's Crown]]
Thus began a tradition of each queen consort having a crown made specially for her.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon-Smith, et al., p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, the [[Crown of Queen Alexandra]], a European-style crown&amp;nbsp;– flatter and with eight [[Half-arch (crown)|half-arches]] instead of the traditional four&amp;nbsp;– was made for [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]], wife of Edward&amp;nbsp;VII, to wear at their coronation. Set with over 3,000 diamonds, it was the first consort crown to include the [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond presented to Queen Victoria in 1850 following the British conquest of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]]. Originally {{convert|191|carat|g|0}} and set in an armlet, it was cut down to an oval brilliant weighing {{convert|105|carat|g|0}}, which Victoria mounted in a brooch and circlet.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, pp. 164–166.&lt;/ref&gt; The second was [[Crown of Queen Mary|Queen Mary's Crown]]; also unusual for a British crown in having eight half-arches, it was made in 1911 for the coronation of [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and George&amp;nbsp;V. It contains 2,200 diamonds and has contained [[Cullinan Diamond#Cullinan III|Cullinans&amp;nbsp;III]] and [[Cullinan Diamond#Cullinan IV|IV]]. In 1914, both stones and the Koh-i-Noor were replaced with crystal replicas and the arches were made detachable so it could be worn as an open crown.&lt;ref name="mtm27"&gt;Mears, et al., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary paid for the [[Art Deco]]-inspired crown and originally hoped that it would be used by future queens consort.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

After George&amp;nbsp;V died, Mary continued wearing the crown (without its arches) as a [[queen mother]], and so the [[Crown of Queen Elizabeth]] was made for [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], wife of George&amp;nbsp;VI and later known as the Queen Mother, to wear at their coronation in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Twining, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only British crown to be made entirely of platinum,&lt;ref name="mtm27"/&gt; and was modelled on Queen Mary's Crown, but has the usual four half-arches instead of eight.&lt;ref name="keay178"&gt;Keay, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The crown is decorated with about 2,800 diamonds, most notably the Koh-i-Noor in the middle of the front cross. It also contains a replica of the {{convert|22.5|carat|g|adj=on|0}} Lahore Diamond given to Queen Victoria by the [[East India Company]] in 1851,&lt;ref&gt;Allison and Riddell, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; and a {{convert|17.3|carat|g|adj=on|0}} diamond given to her by [[Abdülmecid&amp;nbsp;I]], Sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]], in 1856.&lt;ref name="keay178"/&gt; Elizabeth last wore it as an open crown at the coronation of her daughter Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II in 1953. The crown was laid on top of Elizabeth's coffin during her lying in state and funeral in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1907313.stm|title=Priceless gem in Queen Mother's crown|date=4 April 2002|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prince of Wales&lt;!-- No apostrophe --&gt; coronets&lt;!-- Coronet means "small crown". --&gt;===
[[File:Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales.png|thumb|alt=Austere golden coronet with one arch dipped in the centre|Coronet of Prince Frederick]]
A relatively modest coronet was made in 1728 for [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], the eldest son of [[George II of Great Britain|George&amp;nbsp;II]]. It takes the form laid down in a royal warrant issued by Charles&amp;nbsp;II which states that the heir apparent of the Crown shall use and bear a [[coronet]] of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch surmounted by a ball and cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|31709|The Prince of Wales's Coronet (1728)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single arch denotes inferiority to the monarch and shows that the prince outranks other royal children, whose coronets have no arches.&lt;ref&gt;Boutell, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick never wore his gold coronet; instead, it was placed on a cushion in front of him when he [[Introduction (House of Lords)|took his seat]] in the [[House of Lords]]. It was used by his son, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George&amp;nbsp;III]], then his son, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George&amp;nbsp;IV]], and last used by Edward&amp;nbsp;VII when he was Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, et al., p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its age, a new silver-gilt coronet was made for his son, the future [[George V|George&amp;nbsp;V]], to wear at Edward's coronation in 1902. In contrast to the earlier coronet, which has a depressed arch, the arch on this one is raised. At George's own coronation in 1911, the coronet was worn by his son, Edward, the next Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|31710|The Prince of Wales's Coronet (1902)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he became king in 1936, [[Edward&amp;nbsp;VIII]] abdicated later the same year and, as the [[Duke of Windsor]], went into exile in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3623760/abdication-edward-viii/|title=King Edward and Wallis Simpson: The English Royal Abdication|author=Jennifer Latson|website=Time|date=11 December 2014|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking the 1902 coronet with him; it remained abroad until his death in 1972. In its absence, [[Coronet of Charles, Prince of Wales|another coronet]] had to be made for the investiture of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, et al., p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the defunct coronets,&lt;ref name="inventory"/&gt; this one is not a part of the Crown Jewels but the [[Honours of the Principality of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-22679981|title=Prince of Wales' regalia 'should be displayed in Wales'|date=28 May 2013|accessdate=1 July 2016|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-coronation crowns===
In the Jewel House there are two crowns that were not intended to be used at a coronation. [[Small Diamond Crown of Queen Victoria|Queen Victoria's Small Diamond Crown]] is just {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} tall, and was made in 1870 using 1,187 diamonds for Victoria to wear on top of her widow's cap. She often wore it at State Openings of Parliament in place of the much heavier Imperial State Crown. After the queen's death in 1901, Queen Alexandra wore the crown, and it was also worn by Queen Mary.&lt;ref name="rc31705"&gt;{{Royal Collection|31705|Queen Victoria's Small Diamond Crown}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Imperial Crown of India]] was created in 1911 when George&amp;nbsp;V visited the [[Delhi Durbar]] with Queen Mary to be proclaimed (but not crowned) as [[Emperor of India]]. Since the [[British constitution]] prohibits the removal of Crown Jewels from the United Kingdom, a new crown had to be made for the event, with emeralds, rubies, sapphires and 6,100 diamonds. It has not been used since and is now a part of the Crown Jewels.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, et al., p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processional objects==
A coronation begins with the procession into Westminster Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, et al., p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swords===
[[File:British Coronation Swords.png|thumb|upright|alt=Three swords: one of gold and silver appearance covered in stones, the others red with gilded handles and decorations|Left to right: The Sword of Offering, the Sword of State, and the Sword of Mercy]]
The swords of state reflect a monarch's role as [[Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces]] and [[Defender of the Faith]].&lt;ref&gt;Rose, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Three are carried before the monarch into the Abbey: the blunt Sword of Mercy (also known as [[Curtana]]), the Sword of Spiritual Justice, and the Sword of Temporal Justice.&lt;ref name="keay30"/&gt; All are believed to have been supplied at the time of [[James I of England|James&amp;nbsp;I]] between 1610 and 1620, probably by a member of the [[Worshipful Company of Cutlers]],&lt;ref name="strong268"&gt;Strong, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; using blades created in the 1580s by Italian bladesmiths Giandonato and [[Andrea Ferrara]]. They were deposited with St&amp;nbsp;Edward's regalia at the Abbey by Charles&amp;nbsp;II; before then, new swords had been made for each coronation since the 15th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="keay30"/&gt; Sold in the civil war, they were returned at the Restoration, and their first recorded use was at the coronation of [[James II of England|James&amp;nbsp;II]] in 1685.&lt;ref name="strong268"/&gt;

Two other swords are used. The two-handed Sword of State, made in 1678 – a 1660 sword was last used in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century – symbolises the monarch's royal authority. It is also carried before the monarch at State Openings of Parliament.&lt;ref name="keay9697"&gt;Keay, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Its wooden sheath, made in 1689, is bound in crimson velvet decorated with silver-gilt emblems of England, Scotland and Ireland, fleurs-de-lis and portcullises.&lt;ref&gt;Twining, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[The Lion and the Unicorn|lion of England and unicorn of Scotland]] form the cross-piece to the sword's handle. Before the investiture, it is exchanged for the principal Sword of Offering, of which the Sword of State is a metaphor. Commissioned by George&amp;nbsp;IV for his 1821 coronation, its gilded leather sheath is encrusted with 1,251 diamonds, 16 rubies, 2 sapphires and 2 turquoises. The sword has a [[Damascus steel]] blade and is set with 2,141 diamonds, 12 emeralds and 4 rubies.&lt;ref name="rose4951"&gt;Rose, pp. 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt; The precious stones are arranged to form roses, thistles, shamrocks, oak leaves and acorns. Two diamond lion heads, one at each end of the cross-piece, have ruby eyes.&lt;ref name="keay127"&gt;Keay, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; George paid more than £5,000 for the sword out of his own pocket in a radical change from the austere £2 swords used by his 18th-century predecessors. It remained in personal ownership of the Royal family until 1903 when it was deposited with the Crown Jewels and has been used at every coronation since 1911.&lt;ref name="rose4951"/&gt; A monarch is girded and blessed using the sword, which is returned to the [[Keeper of the Jewel House]] by the Abbey for a token sum of £5,&lt;ref name="cjfactsheet2"/&gt; and it is borne unsheathed for the rest of the ceremony.&lt;ref name="rose4951"/&gt;

The defunct Irish Sword of State, made in 1660, was held by the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] (a [[viceroy]]) prior to [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Ireland's independence]] from the United Kingdom in 1922, and also resides at the Tower of London. Its handle takes the form of a lion and unicorn and is decorated with a [[celtic harp]]. Each new viceroy was invested with the sword at [[Dublin Castle]], where it usually sat across the arms of a throne, representing the king or queen. It was borne in procession in front of monarchs upon their official visits to Dublin. In June 1921, the sword was present at the official opening by George&amp;nbsp;V of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] in Belfast. It was displayed at Dublin Castle from September 2017 until April 2018 as part of the 'Making Majesty' exhibition – the first time it had been to Ireland in 95 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincastle.ie/the-irish-sword-of-state/|title=The Irish Sword of State|publisher=Dublin Castle|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===St Edward's Staff===
St&amp;nbsp;Edward's Staff is a {{convert|1.4|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|1}} gold walking stick made for Charles&amp;nbsp;II in 1661. It has a plain monde and cross at the top and a steel pike at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|31717|St Edward's Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; This object is almost certainly a copy of the long rod of silver-gilt mentioned in the list of royal plate and jewels destroyed in 1649.&lt;ref&gt;Twining, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The staff's intended role in the coronation has been forgotten since medieval times, and so it is carried into the Abbey by a [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peer]] as a holy relic and laid on the altar, where it remains throughout the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trumpets===
[[File:Trumpeters and mace bearer 1685.png|thumb|alt=Black-and-white sketch of four men blowing trumpets and one carrying a mace over his shoulder|Trumpeters and a mace bearer at the 1685 coronation of James&amp;nbsp;II]]
The Crown Jewels include 16 silver trumpets dating from between 1780 and 1848.&lt;ref name="inventory"/&gt; Nine of these are draped with red silk [[damask]] banners embroidered with coats of arms in gold, originally made for the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838. They have not been used since the Corps of State Trumpeters was disbanded as a cost-cutting measure in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, et al., p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The trumpeters' main job was to sound a fanfare at key points in the coronation, and they also played at the banquet afterwards in Westminster Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Band of the [[Household Cavalry]] and the [[Central Band of the Royal Air Force]] play their own trumpets at state occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/music/23599.aspx|title=The Band of the Household Cavalry|publisher=British Army|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafmusic/aboutus/centralband.cfm|title=The Central Band of the RAF|publisher=Royal Air Force|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703034841/http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafmusic/aboutus/centralband.cfm|archive-date=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maces===
Beginning as lethal weapons of medieval knights, [[Ceremonial mace|maces]] evolved into ceremonial objects carried by [[Serjeant-at-arms|sergeants-at-arms]] and now represent a monarch's authority.&lt;ref name="ds12"/&gt; The [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] can only operate lawfully when the royal mace&amp;nbsp;– dating from the reign of Charles&amp;nbsp;II&amp;nbsp;– is present at the table. Two other maces dating from the reigns of Charles&amp;nbsp;II and William&amp;nbsp;III are used by the House of Lords: One is placed on the [[Woolsack]] before the house meets and is absent when a monarch is there in person.&lt;ref name="maces"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/mace/|title=Mace (The)|publisher=Parliament.uk|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 17th century, there were 16 maces, but only 13 survive, 10 of which are on display at the Tower of London. Two of these are carried in the royal procession at State Openings of Parliament and coronations. Each mace is about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on|1}} long and weighs an average of {{convert|10|kg|lb|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, et al., p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; They are silver-gilt and were made between 1660 and 1695.&lt;ref name="inventory"/&gt;

==Anointing objects==
When a monarch is anointed, the [[Dean of Westminster]] pours holy anointing oil from an [[ampulla]] into a spoon.&lt;ref&gt;King George's Jubilee Trust, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ampulla===
[[File:The Ampulla.png|thumb|upright|alt=Ornament of an eagle with outspread wings|The Ampulla]]
The Ampulla, {{convert|20.5|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} tall and weighing {{convert|660|g|lb|abbr=on|1}}, is a hollow gold vessel made in 1661 and shaped like an eagle with outspread wings. Its head unscrews, enabling the vessel to be filled, and the oil exits via a hole in the beak.&lt;ref name="ampulla"&gt;{{Royal Collection|31732|The Ampulla}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original ampulla was a phial made of stone, sometimes worn as a pendant by kings, and otherwise kept inside a gold eagle.&lt;ref name="rose9598"&gt;Rose, pp. 95–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteenth-century legend has it that the [[Virgin Mary]] appeared in front of [[Thomas Becket]], Archbishop of Canterbury from 1162 until 1170, and presented to him a gold eagle and phial of oil for anointing English kings.&lt;ref name="ampulla"/&gt; This ampulla was first recorded as being used at the coronation of [[Henry IV of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;IV]] in 1399 and was deposited for safekeeping with St&amp;nbsp;Edward's regalia at the Abbey by Richard&amp;nbsp;III in 1483.&lt;ref name="macgregor257"/&gt; The same batch of oil was used to anoint all kings and queens (except [[Mary&amp;nbsp;I]]) until it ran out in 1625. No one is quite sure why the vessel itself came to be reinterpreted as an eagle standing on a domed base after the Restoration.&lt;ref name="rose9598"/&gt; In terms of religious importance, the anointing objects are second only to St&amp;nbsp;Edward's Crown,&lt;ref&gt;Keay, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ampulla was placed beside the crown on the altar of Westminster Abbey in 2013 at a service marking the 60th anniversary of [[Coronation of Elizabeth II|Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II's coronation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/10096497/Queens-coronation-anniversary-Crown-to-leave-Tower-for-first-time-since-1953-for-Westminster-Abbey-service.html|title=Crown to leave Tower for first time since 1953 for Westminster Abbey service|author=Gordon Rayner|date=4 June 2013|accessdate=14 December 2015|newspaper=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spoon===
The {{convert|27|cm|in|adj=mid|-long|1}} Coronation Spoon, which dates from the late 12th&amp;nbsp;century, is silver-gilt and set with four pearls added in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century. A ridge divides the bowl in half, creating grooves into which the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] dips two fingers and anoints the monarch, confirming him or her as [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]. Originally, the spoon may have been used for mixing water and wine in a chalice, and it was first used to anoint a monarch at the English coronation of James&amp;nbsp;I in 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|31733|The Coronation Spoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the oldest surviving piece of regalia, first recorded in the Royal Collection in 1349 as "a spoon of ancient form", and was probably made for [[Henry II of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;II]] or [[Richard I of England|Richard&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong, pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1649, the spoon was sold to Clement Kynnersley, [[Yeoman of the Removing Wardrobe]], who returned it to Charles&amp;nbsp;II upon the restoration of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wide image|Coronation Spoon.png|644px|alt=Spoon with a long, thin handle and engraved patterns|&lt;center&gt;The silver-gilt Coronation Spoon&lt;/center&gt;}}

==Robes and ornaments&lt;!-- Correct terminology. See, for example, Rose, p. 22; Strong, p. 119; and Twining, p. 68. --&gt;==
The anointing is followed by investment with coronation robes and ornaments.{{efn|Objects are listed in the order in which they are presented to a monarch.}}

===Robes===
[[File:Queen Victoria in Her Coronation Robes.jpg|thumb|alt=Demure young Victoria kneeling before a gold communion cup and wearing a gold robe decorated with roses, thistles and shamrocks|Queen Victoria wearing a copy of the Imperial Mantle, which can be seen at the [[Museum of London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/resources/lecture-podcast-cloth-of-gold-the-use-of-gold-in-royal-couture|title=Cloth of Gold: The Use of Gold in Royal Couture|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|author=Caroline de Guitaut|date=11 February 2015|minutes=16:50|access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1838]]
All the robes have priestly connotations and their form has changed little since the Middle Ages. A tradition of wearing St&amp;nbsp;Edward's robes came to an end in 1547 after the [[English Reformation]] but was revived in 1603 by James&amp;nbsp;I to emphasise his belief in the divine nature of kingship.&lt;ref name="rose99-100"&gt;Rose, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as robes, a monarch also wore either cloth-of-gold [[buskin]]s or sandals, depending on the size of his or her feet.&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Cumming in MacGregor, "'Great vanity and excesse in Apparell'. Some Clothing and Furs of Tudor and Stuart Royalty", p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; The holy relics were destroyed along with royal crowns and ornaments in the Civil War, and new robes were made for each monarch starting with Charles&amp;nbsp;II, a practice that ended in 1911, when George&amp;nbsp;V wore the Supertunica (a [[dalmatic]]) and the Imperial Mantle (a [[cope]]), both made for George&amp;nbsp;IV in 1821.&lt;ref name="rose99-100"/&gt;{{efn|George IV did not wear the Supertunica. Westminster Abbey took custody of both robes, and they were given to the Crown by a private owner in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The robes are of gold thread and together weigh approximately {{convert|10|kg|lb|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, et al., p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; They were also worn by his successors George&amp;nbsp;VI and Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II. A new [[stole (vestment)|stole]] was made in 1953 for Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II by the [[Worshipful Company of Girdlers]]. It is adorned with floral emblems of Australia, Canada, [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]], India, New Zealand, and the four countries of the United Kingdom –&amp;nbsp;members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], which is headed by the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, pp. 277–278.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spurs===
Prick [[spur]]s remade for Charles&amp;nbsp;II are presented to the monarch. They are made of solid gold, richly embossed with floral patterns and scrolls, and have straps of crimson velvet embroidered in gold. Both necks terminate in a [[Tudor rose]] with a spike at its centre. Also known as [[St&amp;nbsp;George]]'s Spurs, they are one of the emblems of knighthood and chivalry, and denote the sovereign's role as head of the Armed Forces. Gold spurs are first known to have been used in 1189 at the coronation of Richard&amp;nbsp;I, though it is likely they were introduced for [[Henry the Young King]] in 1170, and this element of the service was probably inspired by the initiation ceremony of knights. A pair of  mid 14th-century spurs were added to St&amp;nbsp;Edward's regalia at the Abbey in 1399 and used at all coronations until they were destroyed in 1649.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, spurs were fastened to a monarch's feet, but since the Restoration they are simply brushed against the heels of kings or shown to queens.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon-Smith, et al., p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armills===
The [[Armill]]s are gold bracelets of sincerity and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Like spurs, they were first used at English coronations in the 12th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 17th century, armills were no longer delivered to the monarch, but simply carried at the coronation. A new pair had to be made in 1661; they are {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} wide, {{convert|7|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} in diameter, and [[champlevé]] enamelled on the surface with roses, thistles and harps&amp;nbsp;– the national symbols of England, Scotland and Ireland&amp;nbsp;– as well as fleurs-de-lis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|31723|The Armills}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II's coronation in 1953, the medieval tradition was revived, and a new set of plain 22-karat gold armills lined with crimson velvet was presented to the Queen on behalf of various Commonwealth governments. Each bracelet is fitted with an invisible hinge and a clasp in the form of a Tudor rose. The hallmark includes a tiny portrait of the Queen,&lt;ref name="twining171"&gt;Twining, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; who continued to wear the armills on leaving the Abbey and could be seen wearing them later, with the Imperial State Crown and Sovereign's Ring, at her appearance on the balcony of [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Mears, et al., p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbs===
[[File:Sovereign's Orb.png|thumb|upright|alt=Gold ball with a cross at the top and a band of gems around the equator|Sovereign's Orb]]
An orb, a type of [[globus cruciger]], was first used at an English coronation by [[Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII]] in 1509 and then by all subsequent monarchs, apart from early Stuart kings James&amp;nbsp;I and Charles&amp;nbsp;I, who opted for the medieval coronation order. The Tudor orb was deposited with St&amp;nbsp;Edward's regalia at Westminster Abbey in 1625.&lt;ref name="rose45"&gt;Rose, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sovereign's Orb used today is a hollow gold sphere about {{convert|16.5|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} in diameter and weighing {{convert|1.2|kg|lb|abbr=on|1}} (more than twice as heavy as the original&lt;ref name="rose45"/&gt;) made for Charles&amp;nbsp;II in 1661.&lt;ref name="mears19"&gt;Mears, et al., p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; A band of gems and pearls runs along the equator and there is a half-band on the top hemisphere. Atop the orb is an amethyst surmounted by a jewelled cross, symbolising the Christian world, with a sapphire on one side and an emerald on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|31718|The Sovereign's Orb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, the orb is decorated with 375 pearls, 365 diamonds, 18 rubies, 9 emeralds, 9 sapphires, 1 amethyst and 1 piece of glass.&lt;ref name="rose42"&gt;Rose, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; It is handed to the sovereign during the investiture rite of the coronation and is borne later in the left hand when leaving Westminster Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;King George's Jubilee Trust, pp. 26, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; A small version, originally set with hired gems, was made in 1689 for Mary&amp;nbsp;II to hold at her joint coronation with William&amp;nbsp;III; it was never used again at a coronation and is set with imitation gems and cultured pearls. The orb is {{convert|14.6|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} in diameter and weighs {{convert|1.07|kg|lb|abbr=on|1}}.&lt;ref name="mears19"/&gt; Both orbs were laid on Queen Victoria's coffin at her state funeral in 1901. Officially, no reason was given for using Mary&amp;nbsp;II's orb, but it may have been intended to reflect Victoria's position as [[Empress of India]].&lt;ref&gt;Twining, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rings===
Before 1831, each monarch generally received a new ring to symbolise his or her "marriage" to the nation.&lt;ref name=tanner1953&gt;{{cite news|author=Lawrence E. Tanner|title=The Queen's coronation: The story of the regalia|newspaper=Country Life|date=6 June 1953|pages=52–61|url=http://www.countrylife.co.uk/culture/the-queens-coronation-the-story-of-the-regalia-by-lawrence-e-turner-7476|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exception was the Stuart Coronation Ring, probably used at the English coronations of Charles&amp;nbsp;I and Charles&amp;nbsp;II, and certainly that of James&amp;nbsp;II, who took the ring to France after the [[Glorious Revolution]]. It returned to the United Kingdom 100 years later and is now part of the [[Royal_Collection#Gems_and_Jewels|Royal Collection of Gems and Jewels]]. The gold ring has a large ruby etched with a [[St&amp;nbsp;George's Cross]] and bordered by 26 diamonds applied in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="pb"&gt;Piacenti and Boardman, pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; Rubies symbolise all the kingly virtues and have featured on coronation rings since the early Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1830, the ring has been on permanent loan from Windsor Castle to [[Edinburgh Castle]], where it is displayed with the Honours of Scotland.&lt;ref name="pb"/&gt;

The Sovereign's Ring has been used by all monarchs from [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William&amp;nbsp;IV]] in 1831 to Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II in 1953, with the exception of Queen Victoria, whose fingers were too small to retain it.&lt;ref name="tanner1953"/&gt; In the centre of the gold ring is an octagonal sapphire overlaid with a square ruby and four long, narrow rubies forming a cross. Around the sapphire are 14 brilliant diamonds. The general design is intended to represent the red Cross of St&amp;nbsp;George on the blue background of [[Flag of Scotland|St&amp;nbsp;Andrew's Cross]].&lt;ref name="twining171"/&gt; A small copy of the ring was made for Victoria, who wrote in a letter: "The Archbishop had (most awkwardly) put the ring on the wrong finger, and the consequence was that I had the greatest difficulty to take it off again, which I at last did with great pain".&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the ring had been sized to fit the queen's little finger instead of her ring finger due to a misunderstanding by the jewellers.&lt;ref name="Rose, p. 107"&gt;Rose, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, it was deposited at the Tower of London along with the Sovereign's Ring and Queen Consort's Ring, which has been worn by all wives of kings from [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]] onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|31721|The Queen Consort's Ring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sceptres===
[[File:Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross.png|thumb|upright|alt=Gold rod surmounted by a large diamond, itself supporting a large round amethyst, on top of which is a cross made of diamonds with an emerald at its centre. |Head of Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross]]
The [[sceptre]], a symbolic ornamental rod held by the monarch at a coronation, is derived from the [[Shepherd's crook|shepherd's staff]] via the [[crozier]] of a bishop.&lt;ref name="steane36"&gt;Steane, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two gold sceptres made in 1661 are part of the coronation regalia. The Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross is a token of his or her temporal power as head of state. The whole object is {{convert|92|cm|ft|abbr=on|0}} long, weighs around {{convert|1.17|kg|lb|abbr=on|1}}, and is decorated with 333 diamonds, 31 rubies, 15 emeralds, 7 sapphires, 6 spinels and 1 composite amethyst.&lt;ref name="rose41"&gt;Rose, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, it was redesigned to incorporate [[Cullinan&amp;nbsp;I]], also known as the Great Star of Africa, which, at over {{convert|530|carat|g}}, is still the largest clear cut diamond in the world.&lt;ref name="swcross"&gt;{{Royal Collection|31712|The Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of a rough diamond weighing {{convert|3106|carat|g|1}} found in South Africa in 1905 and was named after the chairman of the mining company, [[Thomas Cullinan (diamond magnate)|Thomas Cullinan]]. The gold clasps holding it can be opened and the stone removed to be worn as a pendant hanging from Cullinan&amp;nbsp;II, which is set in the Imperial State Crown, to form a brooch&amp;nbsp;– Queen Mary, wife of George&amp;nbsp;V, often wore it like this.&lt;ref name="mtm30"/&gt; Above the pear-shaped diamond is the amethyst surmounted by a cross pattée encrusted with an emerald and small diamonds.&lt;ref name="swcross"/&gt;

The Sovereign's Sceptre with Dove, which also has been known as the Rod of Equity and Mercy, is emblematic of his or her spiritual role. It is a bit longer at {{convert|1.1|m|ft|abbr=on|1}} but weighs about the same as the Sceptre with Cross. The sceptre is decorated with 285 gemstones, including 94 diamonds, 53 rubies, 10 emeralds, 4 sapphires and 3 spinels.&lt;ref name="rose41"/&gt; Circling the rod are bands of precious stones. At the top is a gold monde set with diamonds and topped by a plain cross, upon which sits a white enamelled dove with its wings outspread, representing the [[Holy Ghost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|31713|The Sovereign's Sceptre with Dove}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sceptre like this first appeared in the 11th&amp;nbsp;century, and it was probably based on the German sceptre, which was topped by an [[Reichsadler|Imperial Eagle]].&lt;ref name="steane36"/&gt; The Sceptre with Dove is the penultimate piece of regalia to be delivered. As the monarch holds both sceptres, he or she is crowned with St&amp;nbsp;Edward's Crown.&lt;ref name="Rose, p. 107"/&gt;

The Crown Jewels include two sceptres made for [[Mary of Modena]], the wife of James&amp;nbsp;II, in 1685: a gold sceptre with a cross known as the Queen Consort's Sceptre with Cross and another topped by a dove known as the Queen Consort's Ivory Rod with Dove, which, as the name suggests, is made of ivory. Unlike the sovereign's dove, this one has folded wings and is relatively small. It was last used by Queen Elizabeth, later known as the Queen Mother, at the coronation of her husband George&amp;nbsp;VI in 1937. For the coronation of Mary&amp;nbsp;II, the wife and joint sovereign of William&amp;nbsp;III, a more elaborate gold sceptre with dove was commissioned in 1689. It has not been used since, and went missing for several decades, only to be found in 1814 at the back of a cupboard in the Tower of London.&lt;ref name="rose42"/&gt;

==Altar plate==
[[File:Coronation of George V 1911 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Black-and-white photograph of large altar dishes standing on a table in front of the royal box during a coronation|Altar dishes behind George&amp;nbsp;V at his coronation in 1911]]
In the Jewel House there is a collection of [[chalice]]s, [[paten]]s, [[flagons]], candlesticks and dishes&amp;nbsp;– all silver-gilt except five gold [[Eucharist|communion]] vessels&amp;nbsp;– that are displayed on the high altar or in front of the royal box at Westminster Abbey during a coronation. Some are also used at other times.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, et al., p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not held or worn by a monarch, such items are Crown Jewels by virtue of their long association with the Jewel House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/themes/trails/the-crown-jewels/banqueting-and-church-plate|title=Banqueting and church plate|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most striking pieces is a large dish {{convert|95|cm|ft|abbr=on}} across and weighing {{convert|13|kg|lb|abbr=on|1}}, in the centre of which is a relief depiction of the [[Last Supper]]. Around the edge are four engravings of biblical scenes: [[Foot washing|the Washing of the Feet]], the [[Road to Emmaus appearance|Walk to Emmaus]], the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)#Symbolism|Coming of the Holy Ghost]], and [[Great Commission|Christ's Commission to the Apostles]]. Made in 1664 for [[James, Duke of York]], and later acquired by Charles&amp;nbsp;II, it stands on the high altar during a coronation ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|31745|Altar Dish (1664)}}&lt;/ref&gt; At each end of the altar stands a {{convert|3|ft|cm|adj=on|order=flip|0|abbr=on}} tall candlestick made in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, which is engraved all over with scrolls, leaves and flowers, and they were also used at the lying in state of Edward&amp;nbsp;VII at Buckingham Palace in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, et al., pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

An altar dish and flagon were made in 1691 for the royal [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula]] at the Tower of London. The dish measures {{convert|70|cm|ft|abbr=on|1}} across; it also has a depiction of the Last Supper, below which is the coat of arms of co-regents William&amp;nbsp;III and Mary&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|31744|Altar Dish (1691)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flagon stands {{convert|42.5|cm|ft|abbr=on|1}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|31752|Flagon (1691)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both pieces are still used in the chapel on Easter, [[Whitsun]] and Christmas, and they were first displayed at a coronation in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon-Smith, et al., p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Another dish still in regular use is the Maundy Dish&amp;nbsp;– one of six used by the Queen at [[Royal Maundy]] for handing out [[alms]] to elderly people in recognition of their service to the church and local community. The ceremony, which takes place in a different cathedral every year, entirely replaced the ancient custom of washing the feet of the poor in 1730, and the dish, though it bears the [[royal cypher]] of William and Mary, dates from the reign of Charles&amp;nbsp;II. Two purses containing specially minted coins are taken from the dish and presented to each recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/49358/Royal-Maundy-Service.pdf|title=The Maundy Service|author=Office for the Royal Maundy|publisher=Westminster Abbey|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banqueting plate==
The last [[Coronation of the British monarch#After-celebrations|coronation banquet]] held at Westminster Hall took place in 1821 for George&amp;nbsp;IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/westminsterhall/other-uses/coronation-banquets/|title=Coronation banquets|publisher=Parliament.uk|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silverware used at those banquets include the Plymouth Fountain, a wine fountain made around 1640 by a German goldsmith and presented to Charles&amp;nbsp;II by the city of [[Plymouth]]. Gilded for George&amp;nbsp;II in 1726, it is {{convert|77.5|cm|ft|abbr=on|1}} tall and decorated with flowers, fruit, dolphins, mermaids and sea monsters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|31742|The Plymouth Fountain}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nautical theme is continued in the silver-gilt Wine Cistern, also known as the Grand Punch Bowl, which is cast as a giant oyster shell. It weighs {{convert|257|kg|st|abbr=on|1}}, is {{convert|0.76|m|ft|abbr=on|1}} tall, {{convert|1.38|m|ft|abbr=on|1}} long and {{convert|1.01|m|ft|abbr=on|1}} wide, and can hold 144 bottles of wine on ice.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, et al., pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; It was commissioned in 1829 by George&amp;nbsp;IV but completed after his death. Weighing over a quarter of a ton, it is the heaviest surviving piece of English banqueting plate.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1841, the cistern was re-purposed as a [[punch bowl]], with the addition of an ivory-stemmed ladle, which is {{convert|1.05|m|ft|abbr=on|1}} long and has a silver-gilt bowl in the form of a [[Chambered nautilus#In literature and art|nautilus shell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|31769|Ladle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exeter Salt, a {{convert|45|cm|ft|adj=on|1}} tall [[salt cellar]] in the form of a castle on a rocky outcrop, was presented to Charles&amp;nbsp;II after the Restoration by the city of [[Exeter]]. Each of its four main compartments, in the turrets, held about {{convert|29|g|oz|abbr=on|0}} of salt, and smaller compartments in the walls held pepper and spices.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; It was made in 1630 by a German goldsmith in [[Hamburg]] and is set with 73 gems.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon-Smith, et al., p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven smaller salts named after St&amp;nbsp;George were originally made for a [[St&amp;nbsp;George's Day]] banquet of the [[Knights of the Garter]] and Charles&amp;nbsp;II in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century. Another, the Queen Elizabeth Salt, was made in 1572 during the reign of Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I for a member of the aristocracy; it was acquired by Charles&amp;nbsp;II. Twelve spoons made for George&amp;nbsp;IV in 1820 complement the salts.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, et al., pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baptismal plate==

Three silver-gilt objects which have been used at royal [[Infant baptism|christenings]] are displayed in the Jewel House.&lt;ref name="inventory"/&gt; Charles&amp;nbsp;II's marriage to [[Catherine of Braganza]] produced no heir, but a font and basin made in 1661 may have been used to baptise some of his 13 illegitimate children.&lt;ref name="mears44"&gt;Mears, et al., p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The font stands {{convert|95.2|cm|ft}} tall,&lt;ref name="inventory"/&gt; and the whole objects weighs {{convert|28.43|kg|lb}}. Its domed lid is surmounted by a figure of [[Philip the Evangelist]] baptising the [[Ethiopian eunuch]]. It was last used to baptise [[Princess Charlotte of Wales]] (child of the future George&amp;nbsp;IV) in 1796, and the basin found a new role as an altar dish in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, while the font was used as a plinth for the Lily Font.&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|31739|Baptismal font and basin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A christening [[Pitcher (container)|ewer]] and basin made in 1735 were used at the christening of the future George&amp;nbsp;III in 1738. His father, [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], had been banished from the royal court by George&amp;nbsp;II and was forbidden to use the Charles&amp;nbsp;II Font.&lt;ref name="mears44"/&gt; An inscription at the front of the ewer records its use at the christening of George&amp;nbsp;III's son, [[Prince Alfred of Great Britain|Prince Alfred]], in 1780. The handle of the ewer is topped by a figure of [[Hercules]] slaying the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]], symbolising the triumph of virtue over vice;&lt;ref name="christening"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/main-topics/general-news/queen-victoria-s-font-to-be-used-for-princess-charlotte-s-baptism-1-7342458|title=Queen Victoria's font to be used for Princess Charlotte's baptism|newspaper=The Yorkshire Post|date=5 July 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it stands {{convert|45.7|cm|ft|1}} tall.&lt;ref name="inventory"/&gt;

The [[Lily font|Lily Font]] was made in 1840 for the christening of [[Victoria, Princess Royal]], the first child of Queen Victoria, who declined to use the Charles&amp;nbsp;II Font because of its unseemly history.&lt;ref name="mears44"/&gt; The font is decorated with water lilies, symbolising purity and new life, and cherubs plucking [[lyre]]s. It has been used for the christenings of all of Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II's children and grandchildren except [[Princess Eugenie]], with holy water from the [[River Jordan]].&lt;ref name="christening"/&gt; The font stands {{convert|43.2|cm|ft}} tall and weighs approximately {{convert|10|kg|lb|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|31741|The Lily Font}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership, management and value==
The Crown Jewels, part of the [[Royal Collection]],&lt;ref name="thecoronation"/&gt; do not officially belong to the nation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/may/30/jubilee.education|title=The Convenient Fiction of Who Owns Priceless Treasure|date=30 May 2002|accessdate=8 June 2018|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are effectively public assets.&lt;ref&gt;McClure, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership is regarded as [[Restraint on alienation|inalienable]] and passes from one monarch to the next by virtue of his or her position as king or queen.&lt;ref name="Bogdanor1997"&gt;Bogdanor, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 17th-century ruling by Sir&amp;nbsp;[[Edward Coke]], which states "the ancient jewels of the crown are heirloomes and shall descend to the next successor and are not devisable by testament", contains an exception allowing the monarch to dispose of objects via [[letters patent]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Lightbown in MacGregor, "The King's Regalia, Insignia and Jewellery", p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|While this [[common law]] was made before the Interregnum, it was cited by lawyers for the Crown in a 1709 legal case, and jurist [[Charles Viner (jurist)|Charles Viner]] wrote in his ''A General Abridgment of Law and Equity'': "the King cannot dispose of … the Jewels of the Crown".&lt;ref&gt;Collins, pp. 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In practice it is unlikely the Crown Jewels will ever be sold,&lt;ref name="Bogdanor1997"/&gt; nor are they insured against loss,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |house=House of Commons |title=Royal Residences |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/2003/jun/19/royal-residences#S6CV0407P0_20030619_CWA_85 |date=19 June 2003 |column=353W |volume=407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are officially priceless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hrpprodsa.blob.core.windows.net/hrp-prod-container/11158/cjs_general_factsheet_revised_2012_2.pdf|title=Crown Jewels factsheet|publisher=Historic Royal Palaces|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In 1995, three historical crown frames then owned by [[Asprey]] and now in the Martin Tower were valued for an [[Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art|export licence]] application:&lt;ref&gt;Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art, pp. 48–50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[State Crown of George&amp;nbsp;I]], £576,000 (c. £{{Inflation|UK-GDP|576000|1995|fmt=c|r=-3}} in {{Inflation-year|UK-GDP}}{{Inflation-fn|UK-GDP}})&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[Crown of Queen Adelaide]], £425,000 (c. £{{Inflation|UK-GDP|425000|1995|fmt=c|r=-3}} in {{Inflation-year|UK-GDP}}{{Inflation-fn|UK-GDP}})&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[Coronation Crown of George&amp;nbsp;IV]], £376,000 (c. £{{Inflation|UK-GDP|376000|1995|fmt=c|r=-3}} in {{Inflation-year|UK-GDP}}{{Inflation-fn|UK-GDP}})&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;}} Their maintenance falls to the [[Crown Jeweller]], a member of the Royal Household who cleans them at the Tower of London each January after visiting hours.

A '''data element name''' is a name given to a [[data element]] in, for example, a [[data dictionary]] or [[metadata registry]].  In a formal data dictionary, there is often a requirement that no two data elements may have the same name, to allow the data element name to become an identifier, though some data dictionaries may provide ways to qualify the name in some way, for example by the application system or other context in which it occurs.

In a database driven data dictionary, the fully qualified data element name may become the primary key, or an alternate key, of a Data Elements table of the data dictionary.

The data element name typically conforms to [[ISO/IEC 11179]] [[metadata registry]] naming conventions and has at least three parts:
*Object, Property and [[Representation term]].
Many standards require the use of [[Camel case|Upper camel case]] to differentiate the components of a data element name.  This is the standard used by [[ebXML]], [[GJXDM]] and [[NIEM]].

__TOC__

==Example of ISO/IEC 11179 name in XML==
Users frequently encounter ISO/IEC 11179 when they are exposed to [[XML]] Data Element names that have a multi-part [[Camel Case]] format:

    '''Object [Qualifier] Property RepresentationTerm'''

The specification also includes normative documentation in appendices.

For example the XML element for a person's given (first) name would be expressed as:

  &lt;PersonGivenName&gt;'''John'''&lt;/PersonGivenName&gt;

Where Person is the Object=Person, Property=Given and [[Representation term]]="Name".  In this case the optional qualifier is not used.

The '''''Dicziunari Rumantsch Grischun''''' (abbreviation DRG) is the biggest [[dictionary]] of the [[Romansh language]].

Founded in 1904 by the [[Indo-Europeanist]] [[Robert von Planta]] and the [[Societad Retorumantscha]], which still bears the responsibility for editing it. It comprises the Romansh [[dialect]]s and [[idiom]]s spoken in the Swiss canton of [[Graubünden]].

The term ''Rumantsch Grischun'' means "the Romansh language spoken in Graubünden" and should not be confused with the standard written language ([[Dachsprache]]) created in the 20th century with the name of [[Rumantsch Grischun]].
&lt;!-- == Typus ==
Das ''Dicziunari Rumantsch Grischun'' ist, neben dem [[Schweizerisches Idiotikon|Schweizerischen Idiotikon]] (Zürich), dem [[Glossaire des patois de la Suisse romande]] (Neuenburg) und dem [[Vocabolario dei dialetti della Svizzera italiana]] (Bellinzona), eines der vier nationalen Wörterbücher und damit eines der vielbändigen, auf wissenschaftlicher Grundlage erarbeiteten lexikographischen Referenzwerke der Schweiz. Es dokumentiert sowohl die bündnerromanischen Ortsdialekte als auch die fünf bündnerromanischen Schriftidiome über einen Zeitraum vom 16. Jahrhundert bis in die Gegenwart und legt überdies einen starken Fokus auf die Beschreibung sach- und volkskundlicher Verhältnisse. Definitionssprache ist das Deutsche.

== Geschichte, Träger- und Herausgeberschaft ==
Das Dicziunari Rumantsch Grischun wurde 1904 von der noch heute als Trägerverein fungierenden ''Societad Retorumantscha'' und dem Indogermanisten [[Robert von Planta]] gegründet. Mithilfe von Fragebögen erhoben Robert von Planta und Florian Melcher zusammen mit Chasper Pult den Grundstock des sprachlichen Materials, das noch heute die Basis für die Wörterbucharbeit darstellt. Das zweite Standbein bilden die Exzerpte aus der gedruckten Literatur, die bis zu den ersten schriftlichen Werken im frühen 16. Jahrhundert berücksichtigt wird.

Herausgegeben wird das Wörterbuch von dem in [[Chur]] domizilierten ''Institut dal Dicziunari Rumantsch Grischun,'' abgekürzt IDRG. Die Finanzierung erfolgt im Wesentlichen durch die [[Schweizerische Akademie der Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaften]], daneben durch Beiträge des Kantons Graubünden sowie den Verkauf der eigenen Publikationen.

Das Institut dal Dicziunari Rumantsch Grischun gibt nicht allein das Wörterbuch heraus, sondern besitzt auch eine umfassende Photothek, die sich aus mehreren Sammlungen zusammensetzt: Die ''Sammlung Bauernhausforschung'' umfasst 7000 Gebäudeaufnahmen und Skizzen sowie 100 Dorfpläne, die ''Sammlung DRG'' 8000 Bilder zur ländlichen Kultur und Arbeitswelt Graubündens, die ''Sammlung Walram Derichsweiler'' 1600 Glasdias zum Leben in der Surselva von 1910 bis 1930, die ''Sammlung Christian und Hans Meisser'' 5000 Landschafts- und Dorfaufnahmen von 1895 bis 1934, die ''Sammlung Alfons Maissen'' 5000 und die ''Sammlung Willy Zeller'' 700 graubündenbezogene Photographien; dazu kommen rund 300 Zeichnungen und Skizzen verschiedener Herkunft.

The merits of '''digital versus film photography''' were considered by photographers and filmmakers in the early 21st century after consumer [[digital camera]]s became widely available. [[Digital photography]] and [[digital cinematography]] have both advantages and disadvantages relative to [[Photographic film|still film]] and [[motion picture film]] photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Digital Imaging |author1=Mark Galer |author2=Les Horvat | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-240-51971-X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vYIMZXSiHYAC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=film-versus-digital&amp;ei=-VfNSKeFKoOQsgO9o8xW&amp;sig=ACfU3U2_wIbu-2SVTsqQCPnGicpYpTfKow#PPA26,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Digital Photographic Capture |author1=Glenn Rand |author-link1=Glenn Rand |author2=David Litschel |author3=Robert Davis | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-240-80632-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cLbl4MASwMYC&amp;pg=PA170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Newer source may be needed, saying this is outdated (or not) for at least quality still digital camera, is the issue still dynamic range?--&gt; In the 21st century photography came to be predominantly digital, but traditional [[Photochemistry|photochemical]] methods continue to serve many users and applications.

== Image quality ==

=== Spatial resolution ===
The visual quality of a digital photograph can be evaluated in several ways. The [[pixel count]] of an image is related to its [[spatial resolution]] and is often used as a [[figure of merit]]. The quantity of picture elements ([[pixel]]s) in the [[image sensor]] is usually counted in millions and called "[[Pixel#Megapixel|megapixels]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Photography &amp; Digital Imaging |author1=Marvin J. Rosen |author2=David L. Devries | publisher = Kendall Hunt | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7575-1159-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Syo9smS-2r8C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=image-sensor+megapixels+resolution+relationship&amp;ei=eV3NSKizKajitQOwvaV_&amp;sig=ACfU3U2y7n98ruqrOuC4XC7Z8n6AHKxB3w }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sensor pixel density sets a limit on the final output resolution of images captured with that sensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Intelligent Integrated Media Communication Techniques |author1=Jurij F. Tasič |author2=Mohamed Najim |publisher = Springer | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-4020-7552-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qktnRKUu3usC&amp;pg=PA374&amp;dq=image-sensor++spatial-resolution&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=pF_NSKS1CJDwsgOd9dDaBw&amp;sig=ACfU3U0OiGtLqSQjDfQIfiIxZ8ZhXywCfg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors, such as the effect of a [[Bayer pattern]] or other filter on the digital sensor and the image processing algorithm used to interpolate raw sensor data to image pixels. Most digital sensors are arranged in a rectangular grid pattern, making certain images (for example of parallel lines) susceptible to [[moire pattern]] artifacts. Film is not affected by moire because of the random orientation of the silver salts in its emulsion, however the pattern of these silver salts may become visible upon enlargement, creating the patterns called "grain" in the final output.&lt;ref name="Amadror"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Theory of the Moiré Phenomenon | author = Issac Amadror | publisher = Springer London| year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-84882-180-4 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/kt36w1812285r374/ |chapter = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution of film images depends upon the area of film used to record the image ([[135 film|35 mm]], [[Medium format (film)|medium format]] or [[large format]]) and the [[film speed]]. Estimates of a photograph's resolution taken with a [[135 film|35{{nbsp}}mm film]] camera vary. More information may be recorded if a [[Film grain|fine-grain film]] is used, while the use of poor-quality optics or coarse-grained film may yield lower image resolution. A 36{{nbsp}}mm × 24{{nbsp}}mm frame of ISO 100-[[Film speed|speed film]] was initially estimated to contain the equivalent of 20 million pixels,&lt;ref name="Langford"&gt;{{cite book|title = Basic Photography (7th Ed.)
|first = Michael
|last = Langford
|year = 2000
|location = Oxford
|publisher = Focal Press
|ISBN = 0-240-51592-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or approximately 23,000 pixels per square mm.

Many professional-quality film cameras use [[medium format (film)|medium-format]] or [[large-format]] films. Because of the relatively large size of the imaging area these media provide, they can record higher resolution images than most consumer digital cameras. Based upon the above pixel density, a medium-format film image can record an equivalent resolution of approximately 83 million pixels in the case of a 60 x 60 mm frame, to 125 million pixels in the case of a 60 x 90 mm frame.  In the case of large format, 4 x 5 inch films can record approximately 298.7 million pixels, and  1,200 million pixels in the case of 8 x 10 inch film. However, as with a digital system, poor optical quality of lenses will decrease the resolving potential of a film emulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petapixel.com/2014/12/18/comparing-image-quality-film-digital/|title=Comparing the Image Quality of Film and Digital|date=18 December 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.users.qwest.net/~rnclark/scandetail.htm#digicamres2 Resolution Test Area 2: trees and Mountains] R. N. Clark, 8 April 2001. Retrieved 2 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=August 2017}}

=== Noise and grain ===
[[Shot noise]], produced by spontaneous fluctuations in detected photocurrents, degrades darker areas of electronic images with random variations of pixel color and brightness. [[Film grain]] becomes obvious in areas of even and delicate tone. Grain and [[Film speed|film sensitivity]] are linked, with more sensitive films having more obvious grain. Likewise, with digital cameras, images taken at higher sensitivity settings show more [[image noise]] than those taken at lower sensitivities.&lt;ref name="Langford" /&gt;

However, even if both techniques have inherent noise, it is widely appreciated that for color, digital photography has much less noise/grain than film at equivalent sensitivity, leading to an edge in image quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normankoren.com/Tutorials/MTF7A.html#Shannon Shannon information theory, noise and perceived image quality] Norman Koren, 2000/2010, retrieved May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For black-and-white photography, grain takes a more positive role in image quality, and such comparisons are less valid.

Noise in digital cameras can produce color distortion or confetti-like patterns, in indoor lighting typically occurring most severely on the blue component and least severely on the red component. Nearly all digital cameras apply [[noise reduction]] to [[long-exposure photograph]]s to counteract noise due to pixel leakage. For very long exposures, the [[image sensor]] must be operated at low temperatures to prevent noise affecting the final image. Film grain is not affected by exposure time, although the marginal sensitivity of the film changes with lengthy exposures, a phenomenon known as [[reciprocity failure]]. &lt;!--Fact given in the link--&gt;

=== Autofocus and auto exposure systems ===
Traditional exposure metering and autofocus systems employ secondary sensors, whose readings are typically low-fidelity (e.g. a very small number of averaged readings from various image areas vs. fully resolved image information) and may not correspond to the actually recorded image, for example due to [[parallax]] issues, differing sensitivity towards [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], differing spectral response, differing amplitude response, [[optical aberration]]s of optical elements in the sensing system, differing sensitivity towards stray light, or misalignment of the [[focal plane]] of the sensor.
Most digital cameras allow users to capture and analyze image information from the same sensor as used for image recording in real-time. Using this information for exposure and focus determination inherently eliminates most alignment and calibration issues, while simultaneously eliminating the cost of secondary metering sensors.

=== White balance ===
Film typically assumes using separate films to account for white balance of scene (typically in two variants: for sunlight or tungsten lamps), or usage of filters. Many film cameras had a dial to help user keep track of type of film that was loaded in the camera. &lt;!-- Some films have marks in the perforation area to help calirate --&gt;

=== Dynamic range ===
[[Dynamic range]] is a significant factor in the quality of both the digital and emulsion images. Both film and digital sensors exhibit non-linear responses to the amount of light, and at the edges of the dynamic range, close to underexposure and overexposure the media will exhibit particularly non-linear responses. The non-linear dynamic response or saturation qualities of emulsion film are often considered a desirable effect by photographers, and the distortion of colour, contrast and brightness varies considerably between film stocks. There is no limit{{cn|date=December 2017}} to the number of possible levels of colour on emulsion film, whereas a digital sensor stores integer numbers, producing a limited and specific possible number of colours.  [[Color banding|Banding]] may be visible in the unusual case that it is not obscured by noise, and detail may be lost, particularly in shadow and highlight areas.

Digital sensors might also suffer from [[Blooming (CCD)|blooming]] issue, though degree of it varies significantly between sensors.

Digital camera manufacturers have made consistent improvements in the dynamic range captured by their products. Some cameras have an automatic [[exposure bracketing]] mode, to be used in conjunction with [[high-dynamic-range imaging]] software.{{cn|date=August 2017}}   Output media also have characteristic limitations to the dynamic range they are able to reproduce and the linearity of display.

=== Convenience and flexibility ===
Flexibility and convenience are among the reasons for the widespread adoption of digital cameras. With film cameras, a roll is usually completely exposed before being processed. When the film is returned, it is possible to see the photograph, but most digital cameras incorporate a [[liquid crystal display]] that allows the image to be viewed immediately after capture. The photographer may delete undesired or unnecessary photographs, or reshoot the image if required. A user who wants prints can quickly and easily print just the required photographs.

Photographic film is made with specific characteristics of [[colour temperature]] and [[Film speed|sensitivity]] (ISO). Lighting conditions often require characteristics different from those of the film specifications, requiring the use of [[Photographic filter|filters]] or corrections in [[Photographic processing|processing]]. Digital photography allows colour temperature and sensitivity to be adjusted at each shot, either manually or automatically.

Digital images may be conveniently stored on a personal computer or in [[off-line storage]] such as small [[memory card]]s. Professional-grade digital cameras can store pictures in a [[raw image format]], which stores the output from the sensor, rather than processing it immediately to form an image. When edited in suitable software, such as [[Adobe Photoshop]] or the GNU program [[GIMP]] (which uses [[dcraw]] to read raw files), the user may manipulate certain parameters, such as contrast, sharpness, or [[colour balance]] before producing an image. [[JPEG]] images can be similarly manipulated, though usually less precisely; software for this purpose may be provided with consumer-grade cameras. Digital photography allows the quick collection of a large quantity of archival documents, bringing convenience, lower cost, and increased flexibility in using the documents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.physorg.com/news139751840.html,Accelerated research using a digital camera&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some areas where film may have some advantages. Modern film cameras are not as power-thirsty as modern digital cameras and can last longer on smaller batteries. Some film cameras, especially older ones, can operate without batteries: some will function completely without batteries, while others may lose some functionality such as metering and some shutter speeds. Batteries that only have to power light meters are often very small and can last a long time. This can be a boon for those who may be spending a long time with little or no access to electricity or a source of batteries.

=== Film speed ===
Compared to film, digital cameras are capable of much higher [[film speed|speed]] (sensitivity to light) and can perform better in low light or very short exposures. The effective speed of a digital camera can be adjusted at any time, while the film must be changed in a film to change the speed.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== Cleanliness ===
Dust on the image plane is a constant issue for photographers, and especially so in digital photography. DSLR cameras are especially prone to dust problems because the sensor remains in place, whereas a film advances through the camera for each exposure. Debris in the camera, such as dust or sand, may scratch the film; a single grain of sand can damage a whole roll of film. As film cameras age, they can develop burs in their rollers.  With a digital SLR, dust is difficult to avoid but is easy to rectify using a computer with image-editing software. Some digital SLRs have systems that remove dust from the sensor by vibrating or knocking it, sometimes in conjunction with software that remembers where dust is located and removes dust-affected pixels from images.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Compact digital cameras are fitted with fixed lenses, which makes it harder for dust to get into the image area. Similar film cameras are often only light-tight and not environmentally sealed. Some modern DSLRs, like the Olympus E-3, incorporate extensive dust and weather seals to avoid this problem.

== Cost ==
Film and digital imaging systems have different cost emphases. Digital cameras are significantly more expensive to purchase than film equivalents. Prices are however dropping rapidly due to intense competition. Film cameras, on the other hand, are quite inexpensive to purchase, especially used equipment, but require ongoing film and development costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virtualphotographystudio.com/photographyblog/2010/12/is-digital-cheaper-than-film/|title=Is Digital Cheaper Than Film?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the digital realm, it could be argued that the constant state of technological change will cause a digital user to keep upgrading and buying other equipment once their digital camera becomes quickly obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/01/five-reasons-you-should-ditch-your-dslr/|title=5 Reasons to Ditch Your Digital SLR|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other costs of digital photography include specialized batteries, memory cards and long-term data storage.  The cost of digital editing software can be considerable, especially if newer features are required.  The emergence of very high quality phone cameras since the early 2010s are making lower end, small sensor digital cameras redundant, almost as quickly as they grew in the last decade. Consequently, manufacturers are focusing attention to premium models such as compact system cameras and large sensor compacts. Mobile phones such as the iPhone X, Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Nokia Lumia 1020 are capable of images that can rival or beat cheaper dedicated cameras. [[Inkjet printer]]s can make low-quality prints cheaply and easily from digital files, but high-quality inkjet printing has costs comparable to wet photo process printing, regardless of initial image source.

== Film industry ==
There are [[film industry]] specific arguments in the film vs. digital debate.

Most [[digital cinema]] is displayed in [[2K resolution]], which is only a small amount more resolution than the consumer-oriented [[1080p HD]] format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reduser.net/forum/archive/index.php/t-2398.html|title=2K vs 1080p resolution question [Archive]  - REDUSER.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High profile film directors such as [[Christopher Nolan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/christopher-nolan-discusses-why-he-prefers-film-to-digital-his-approach-to-cgi-and-much-more|title=Christopher Nolan talks film vs. digital, his take on CGI, his disinterest in 3D, and much more in insightful DGA interview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7npmu9Ge_OY|title=pta on digital vs. film|first=|last=cigsandvines|date=10 August 2006|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quentin Tarantino]] have all publicly criticized digital cinema and [[digital cinematography]], and advocated the use of film and film prints. Most famously, Tarantino suggested in 2012 that he wanted to retire because (although he can still shoot on film) he cannot project on 35mm prints in most American cinemas, because of the rapid conversion to digital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a441960/quentin-tarantino-i-cant-stand-digital-filmmaking-its-tv-in-public.html|title=Tarantino can't stand digital filmmaking|date=30 November 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Thomas Anderson recently was able to create the most [[70mm film]] prints in years for his film ''[[The Master (2012 film)|The Master]]''. There also are many film directors such as [[Peter Jackson]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], [[George Lucas]], and [[James Cameron]] who are adamant supporters of digital cinema and the potential for higher frame rates that it brings.

&lt;!-- Dear Editor, you may wish to update the summary in the [[Online medical wiki encyclopedias]] page as well --&gt;

'''Ganfyd''' is a [[medical]] [[Wiki|wiki community]] and [[List of online encyclopedias#Medicine and surgery|online medical wiki encyclopedia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ginn S |title=Evidence based mental health and Web 2.0 |journal=Evid Based Mens Health |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=69–72 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20682812 |doi=10.1136/ebmh.13.3.69 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; created in November 2005 by a group of doctors working in the [[United Kingdom]]. The site has been the subject of academic exposition into emerging methods of disseminating medical information and more specifically, the restricting of editors within an open collaborative wiki environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moturu|first=Sai T.|author2=Liu, Huan |author3=Johnson, William G. |date=2008-08-20|title=Trust Evaluation in Health Information on the World Wide Web|publisher=30th Annual International IEEE EMBS Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLean|first=Rick |author2=Richards, Brian H |author3=Wardman, Janet I|date=2007-08-06|title=The effect of Web 2.0 on the future of medical practice and education: Darwikinian evolution or folksonomic revolution?|journal=Medical Journal of Australia|volume=187|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barskey|first=Eugene|author2=Giustini, Dean|year=2007|title=Introducing Web 2.0: wikis for health librarians|journal=J Can Health Libr Assoc|volume=28|pages=147–150|doi=10.5596/c07-036|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model has subsequently been copied by other medical wikis, but some attempts to improve on the model, such as [[Medpedia]] have failed. In 2010, Paula Younger noted it as a laudable attempt to make medical information freely accessible and authoritative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1108/09504121011019899|last=Younger|first=Paula|year=2010|title=Beyond Wikipedia: how good a reference source are medical wikis?|journal=Reference Reviews|volume=24|issue=1|pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
Only [[registered medical practitioner]]s or persons working under their direction, and a small number of invited non-medical specialists, may edit ganfyd articles, and its [http://ganfyd.org/deeds/commons.html license] specifically prohibits editing by people who are not registered medical practitioners. The intention is to make the articles reliable enough for professional medical use. An audit trail is publicly available for each article.

Registration is by a variety of mechanisms, including a [[General Medical Council|GMC]] Certificate or equivalent.

==History==
Ganfyd is intended to become a large online textbook of human [[medicine]]. By October 2010 there were over 2,000 page hits a day and it had reached 7,000 topic pages with over double that number of pages including stubs and redirects and 449 editors from six countries ([[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[United States]]). As of 2016 it has over 10,000 topic pages.

In December 2006, the Ganfyd site was noted as a specific example of a wiki being used as a low cost alternative to commercial point of care tools like UpToDate with the search portal Trip already indexing it.&lt;ref&gt;Dean Giustini, ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7582/1283?ct "How Web 2.0 is Changing Medicine"]&lt;/ref&gt; This may be the first example of a medical wiki being indexed by an independent medical search engine.

==Meaning==
"''Ganfyd''" is an [[acronym]] meaning "Get a note from your doctor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Thoeny, Peter |author2=Woods, Dan |title=Wikis for dummies |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=68 |isbn=0-470-04399-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase is known to be used by employers, insurance underwriters, and sports instructors to their respective employees/clients. In some cases, this may be intended to absolve the employer/instructor from liability in the event that the client suffers physical harm.

Some medical practitioners regard this as a cynical use of their time and skill, thus they use the term "ganfyd" [[pejorative]]ly.

The '''General Industrial Exposition of Stockholm (1866)''' (Swedish: ''1866 års allmänna industriutställning i Stockholm'') or only the '''Stockholm Exposition of 1866''' (Swedish: ''Stockholmsutställningen 1866'') was an international aviation exhibition held in the Swedish capital of [[Stockholm]]. 
It was the first international Art- and Industrial Exposition held after a European pattern in Sweden. Circa 3.800 people from Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland participated. The exposition was took place in the Industrial Hall at [[Kungsträdgården]] and at the [[Nationalmuseum]] on Blasieholmen in Stockholm between the 15 June and the 14 October 1866.

This glossary lists types of [[key (cryptography)|key]]s as the term is used in [[cryptography]], as opposed to [[key (lock)|door locks]]. Terms that are primarily used by the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] are marked ''(NSA)''. For classification of keys according to their usage see [[cryptographic key types]].

* '''40-bit key''' - key with a [[40-bit encryption|length of 40 bits]], once the upper limit of what could be [[export of cryptography|exported]] from the U.S. and other countries without a license. Considered very insecure. ''See''  [[key size]] for a discussion of this and other lengths.
* '''authentication key''' - Key used in a keyed-hash message authentication code, or [[HMAC]].
* '''benign key''' - (NSA) a key that has been protected by encryption or other means so that it can be distributed without fear of its being stolen. Also called '''BLACK key'''.
* '''content-encryption key (CEK)''' a key that may be further encrypted using a KEK, where the content may be a message, audio, image, video, executable code, etc.
* '''crypto ignition key''' An NSA key storage device ([[KSD-64]]) shaped to look like an ordinary physical key.
* '''cryptovariable''' - NSA calls the output of a [[stream cipher]] a key or key stream. It often uses the term '''cryptovariable''' for the bits that control the stream cipher, what the public cryptographic community calls a [[key (cryptography)|key]].
* '''data encryption key (DEK)''' used to encrypt the underlying data.
* '''derived key''' - keys computed by applying a predetermined [[hash algorithm]] or [[key derivation function]] to a [[password]] or, better, a [[passphrase]].
* '''DRM key''' - A key used in [[Digital Rights Management]] to protect media
* '''electronic key''' - (NSA) key that is distributed in electronic (as opposed to paper) form. ''See'' [[EKMS]].
* '''ephemeral key''' - A key that only exists within the lifetime of a communication session.
* '''expired key''' - Key that was issued for a use in a limited time frame ([[cryptoperiod]] in NSA parlance) which has passed and, hence, the key is no longer valid.
* '''FIREFLY key''' - (NSA) keys used in an NSA system based on [[public key cryptography]].
* '''Key derivation function (KDF)''' - function used to derive a key from a secret value, e.g.  to derive KEK from Diffie-Hellman key exchange.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}
* '''key encryption key (KEK)''' - key used to protect MEK keys (or DEK/TEK if MEK is not used).
* '''key production key (KPK)''' -Key used to initialize a keystream generator for the production of other electronically generated keys.
* '''key fill''' - (NSA) loading keys into a cryptographic device. ''See'' [[fill device]].
* '''master key''' - key from which all other keys (or a large group of keys) can be derived. Analogous to a [[key (lock)|physical key]] that can open all the doors in a building.
* '''master encryption key (MEK)''' -  ''Used to encrypt the DEK/TEK key.''
[[File:NSA DIANA one time pad.tiff|thumb|A sample NSA [[one-time pad]]]]
* '''[[one time pad]] (OTP or OTPad)''' - keying material that should be as long as the [[plaintext]] and should only be used once. If truly random and not reused it's the most secure encryption method. ''See'' [[one-time pad]] article.
* '''one time password (OTP)''' - One time password based on a prebuilt single use code list or based on a mathematical formula with a secret seed known to both parties, uses event or time to modify output (see TOTP/HOTP).
* '''paper key''' - (NSA) keys that are distributed in paper form, such as printed lists of settings for [[rotor machine]]s, or keys in [[punched card]] or [[paper tape]] formats. Paper keys are easily copied. ''See'' [[Walker spy ring]], ''RED key''.
* '''poem key''' - Keys used by [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] agents in World War II in the form of a poem that was easy to remember. ''See'' [[Leo Marks]].
* '''Public/private key''' - in [[public key cryptography]], separate keys are used to encrypt and decrypt a message. The encryption key ('''public key''') need not be kept secret and can be published. The decryption or '''private key''' must be kept secret to maintain confidentiality. Public keys are often distributed in a signed [[public key certificate]].
* '''pre-placed key''' - (NSA) large numbers of keys (perhaps a year's supply) that are loaded into an encryption device allowing frequent key change without refill.
* '''RED key''' - (NSA) symmetric key in a format that can be easily copied, e.g. ''paper key'' or unencrypted ''electronic key''. Opposite of ''BLACK'' or ''benign key''.
* '''revoked key''' - a public key that should no longer be used, typically because its owner is no longer in the role for which it was issued or because it may have been compromised. Such keys are placed on a [[certificate revocation list]] or '''CRL'''.
* '''[[session key]]''' - key used for one message or an entire communications session. ''See traffic encryption key.''
* '''symmetric key''' - a key that is used both to encrypt and decrypt a message. Symmetric keys are typically used with a cipher and must be kept secret to maintain confidentiality.
* '''traffic encryption key (TEK)/data encryption key (DEK)''' - a symmetric key that is used to encrypt messages. TEKs are typically changed frequently, in some systems daily and in others for every message. See ''session key''. DEK is used to specify any data form type (in communication payloads or anywhere else).
* '''transmission security key (TSK)''' - (NSA) seed for a [[pseudorandom number generator]] that is used to control a radio in [[frequency hopping]] or [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] modes. ''See'' [[HAVE QUICK]], [[SINCGARS]], [[electronic warfare]].
* '''seed key''' - (NSA) a key used to initialize a cryptographic device so it can accept operational keys using benign transfer techniques. Also a key used to initialize a [[pseudorandom number generator]] to generate other keys.
* '''signature key''' - [[public key cryptography]] can also be used to electronically sign messages. The private key is used to create the electronic signature, the public key is used to verify the signature. Separate public/private key pairs '''must''' be used for signing and encryption. The former is called '''signature keys'''.
* '''stream key''' - the output of a [[stream cipher]] as opposed to the key (or ''cryptovariable'' in NSA parlance) that controls the cipher
* '''training key''' - (NSA) un[[classified information|classified]] key used for instruction and practice exercises.
* '''Type 1 key''' - (NSA) keys used to protect [[classified information]]. ''See'' [[Type 1 product]].
* '''Type 2 key''' - (NSA) keys used to protect sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information. ''See'' [[Type 2 product]].
* '''Vernam key''' - Type of key invented by [[Gilbert Vernam]]  in 1918. ''See stream key''.
* '''zeroized key''' - key that has been erased (see [[zeroisation]].)

'''Graphiq''' (formerly '''FindTheBest''') is a [[Semantics|semantic]] technology company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.graphiq.com/about|title=Graphiq {{!}} About|website=www.graphiq.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; that uses [[artificial intelligence]] to rapidly create interactive data-driven infographics.&lt;ref name="inc.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/graphiq-ap-visualizations.html|title=Meet the A.I.

Graphiq's flagship product for online content creators, Graphiq Search,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.graphiq.com/search|title=Graphiq Search|website=www.graphiq.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows users to access its library of 10B+ interactive visualizations.&lt;ref name="inc.com"/&gt; Additionally, Graphiq offers 22 vertically aligned research sites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.graphiq.com/vertical-search|title=Graphiq Research Sites|website=www.graphiq.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allow consumers to research important topics. The company states that 33 million visitors use Graphiq research sites every month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.graphiq.com/advertiser-solutions|title=Graphiq Advertising Solutions|website=www.graphiq.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.graphiq.com/researcher-solutions|title=Graphiq {{!}} Solutions for Researchers|website=www.graphiq.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data from Graphiq is [[data mining|mined]] from a variety of public and private sources and presented to users in a [[visual]] table with filters and [[Evaluation|ratings]].&lt;ref name="TC1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/05/data-driven-comparison-shopping-platform-findthebest-raises-11m-from-new-world-kleiner-perkins-and-others/ |title=Data-Driven Comparison Shopping Platform FindTheBest Raises $11M From New World, Kleiner Perkins And Others |date=March 5, 2013 |author=Leena Rao |publisher=TechCrunch |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphiq is based in [[Santa Barbara, California]] and has raised $32 million in total funding from venture funding companies by 2013.&lt;ref name="inc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/technology/computer-algorithms-rely-increasingly-on-human-helpers.html?_r=0 |title=Algorithms Get a Human Hand in Steering Web |date=March 10, 2013 |author=Steve Lohr |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/51643824/ns/business-press_releases/t/findthebest-names-most-coveted-products-dads-grads-popular-gift-categories/#.UY0yrrW87zw |title=FindTheBest Names the Most Coveted Products for Dads and Grads in Popular Gift Categories |date=April 24, 2013 |author= |publisher=NBC News |accessdate=May 21, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Amazon acquired Graphiq for an estimated $50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Amazon acquires Santa Barbara start-up Graphiq to try to bolster Alexa"|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-graphiq-amazon-20170719-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|publisher=tronc, Inc.|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Graphiq announced that its features for news publishers would no longer be available on July 21, 2017 as part of the transition.

==History==
The company was founded in 2009 as FindTheBest by [[Kevin O'Connor (entrepreneur)|Kevin J. O'Connor]], former [[CEO]] and co-founder of [[DoubleClick]], Scott Leonard and Brayton Johnson.&lt;ref name="BW1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=115559829 |title=Company Overview of FINDTHEBEST.COM, Inc. |date= |author= |publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was publicly launched in 2010 with nine comparison categories, including [[health]], [[education]], [[business]], and [[sports]].&lt;ref name="VB1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/12/07/findthebest-redesign/ |title=FindTheBest upgrades with even more visual comparisons of almost everything |date=December 7, 2011 |author=Dylan Tweney |publisher=VentureBeat |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SE1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://searchengineland.com/doubleclick-founder-launches-findthebest-structured-decision-engine-47860 |title=DoubleClick Founder Launches Structured "Decision Engine" FindTheBest.com |date=August 2, 2010 |author=Greg Sterling |publisher=Search Engine Land |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The venture was funded with an initial investment of $750,000 each from the founders, followed by $2 million by [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]] in December 2010.&lt;ref name="SE1"/&gt;

In 2011, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers invested an additional $4 million into the company.&lt;ref name="alexa" /&gt; FindTheBest also added another $11 million in Series B funding from New World Ventures, [[Montgomery &amp; Co.]], Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Pritzker Group Venture Capital and others.&lt;ref name="SCT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socaltech.com/findthebest_lands___m_for_comparison_engine/s-0048066.html |title=FindTheBest Lands $11M For Comparison Engine |date=March 5, 2013 |author= |publisher=Socialtech.com |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, FindTheBest had reached 23 million visits per month and employed a team of approximately 110 people.&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite web|title=FindTheCompany releases data on 30M businesses to clue in consumers|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/06/18/findthecompany-releases-data-on-30m-businesses-to-clue-in-consumers/|publisher=VentureBeat|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has continually added new services. In 2011, it launched FindTheData.com. The AssistMe option was added in 2012. In January 2013, the company made its first international expansion and launched sites in Spain, South Korea, and New Zealand. In April 2013, the company launched sites in Germany and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="VB" /&gt; Its real estate research site FindTheHome launched in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.inman.com/2015/01/28/research-engine-publishing-real-estate-agent-performance-statistics/|title=Research engine publishing real estate agent performance statistics|newspaper=Inman|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, the company rebranded to Graphiq Inc. and launched a new set of tools for publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/findthebest-rebrands-graphiq-launches-data-120000535.html|title=FindTheBest Rebrands as Graphiq; Launches New Data Visualization Products for Online Publishing Industry|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="social.techcrunch.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/11/findthebest-becomes-graphiq/|title=FindTheBest Becomes Graphiq, Launches New Visualization Tools For Publishers|last=Ha|first=Anthony|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article in TechCrunch, those "products include Graphiq Search, where journalists can search through the company’s existing visualizations; a Graphiq Feed with news alerts and research; and Graphiq Plugins, starting with integrations for WordPress and WordPress VIP, which automatically recommend visualizations that may be relevant for a given story."&lt;ref name="social.techcrunch.com"/&gt; At the time, the company's database included 1 billion entities, 120 billion attributes and 25 billion relationships.&lt;ref name="social.techcrunch.com"/&gt;

==Product==
The company's primary consumer provision is its vertically aligned research sites, which let users research products and services on a desktop or mobile device, such as cars, colleges, investment advisors, smartphones, computers.&lt;ref name="SE1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AA1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findthebest.appappeal.com/ |title=FindTheBest - Consumer Services Comparison Community  |date= |author= |publisher=AppAppeal |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can filter their options and view Smart Ratings to assist in narrowing down their product selection. They are also able to add or edit product and service listings. Each edit is reviewed by Graphiq's team before it goes live.&lt;ref name="TC4"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/07/findthebest-smart-ratings/ |title=FindTheBest Adds Smart Ratings And A Better Way To Compare Products |date=December 7, 2011 |author=Srick Schonfeld |publisher=TechCrunch |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company offers a variety of products for online content creators and journalists, including Graphiq Search, Feed and Plugins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.graphiq.com/journalist-solutions|title=Graphiq {{!}} Solutions for Journalists|website=www.graphiq.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers that use Graphiq visualizations include [[AOL]], [[MSN]], [[International Business Times|The International Business Times]] and [[Hearst (media)|Hearst Newspapers]].&lt;ref name="social.techcrunch.com"/&gt; In August 2016, [[Reuters]] announced a partnership with Graphiq to deliver a suite of interactive visualizations to Reuters customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thomsonreuters.com/en/press-releases/2016/august/reuters-graphiq-interactive-data-visualizations.html|title=Reuters and Graphiq deliver interactive data visualizations to publishers|newspaper=Thomson Reuters|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/13/reuters-is-the-latest-large-news-agency-to-embrace-content-automation/|title=Reuters is the latest large news agency to embrace content automation|last=Kolodny|first=Lora|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/reading/reuters-is-working-with-graphiq-to-create-data-visualizations-for-clients/|title=Reuters is working with Graphiq to create data visualizations for clients|newspaper=Nieman Lab|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, The Associated Press announced an expanded collaboration with Graphiq to introduce paired visualizations with AP text content.&lt;ref name="inc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ap.org/Content/Press-Release/2016/AP-and-Graphiq-expand-collaboration-to-offer-interactive-visualizations-to-all-AP-customers|title=AP and Graphiq expand collaboration to offer interactive visualizations to all AP customers|website=www.ap.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business model ==
The site attempts to bridge the gap between search engines like Google and review-type services like Yelp. O'Connor describes it as a "research engine." Each research site is free for consumers and monetized with advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/12/01/openx-and-graphiq-expand-relationship-with-header-bidding/|title=OpenX and Graphiq Expand Relationship with Header Bidding|website=VentureBeat|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sovrn.com/blog/graphiq-header-bidding-case-study/|title=Sovrn Blog: Graphiq Grows Revenue by Over 40% with Header Bidding|date=2016-10-28|newspaper=sovrn|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visualizations pull from the same database that powers the research sites and each visualization includes the Graphiq logo and a link back to one of the company's research sites where they monetize users with advertisements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1212">The '''Hall of Union''' ({{zh|c=交泰殿|p=Jiāo Tài Diàn}}) is a building in the [[Forbidden City]], in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. It stands between the [[Palace of Heavenly Purity]] and the [[Palace of Earthly Tranquility]]. These three halls together constitute the centre of the Inner Court of the palace complex.

The hall is square in shape with a pyramidal roof. Stored here are the 25 [[Chinese seal|Imperial Seals]] of the [[Qing dynasty]], as well as other ceremonial items, including the clocks that set the official time in the palace (first a [[water clock]], later a mechanical clock, both still displayed in the hall.&lt;ref name="CCTV3"&gt;{{cite video | people=China Central Television, The Palace Museum |date=2005 | url=http://www.cctv.com/history/special/C15041/01/index.shtml| title=Gugong: "III.

'''Heritage Documentation Programs''' ('''HDP''') is a division of the U.S. [[National Park Service]] (NPS) responsible for administering the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), Historic American Engineering Record (HAER), and Historic American Landscapes Survey (HALS). These programs were established to document historic places in the United States. Records consist of measured drawings, archival photographs, and written reports, and are archived in the Prints and Photographs Division of the [[Library of Congress]].

In 1933, NPS established the Historic American Buildings Survey following a proposal by [[Charles E. Peterson]], a young [[landscape architect]] in the agency. It was founded as a constructive [[make-work program]] for architects, draftsmen and photographers left jobless by the [[Great Depression]]. Guided by field instructions from [[Washington, D.C.]], the first HABS recorders were tasked with documenting a representative sampling of America's [[Cultural heritage|architectural heritage]]. By creating an archive of historic architecture, HABS provided a [[database]] of primary source material and documentation for the then-fledgling [[historic preservation]] movement. Earlier private projects included the [[White Pine Series of Architectural Monographs]], many contributors to which later joined the HABS program.

Notable HABS photographers include [[Jack Boucher]], who worked for the project for over 40 years.

The Historic American Engineering Record program was founded on January 10, 1969, by NPS and the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. HAER documents historic mechanical and engineering artifacts. Since the advent of HAER, the combined program is typically called "HABS/HAER". Today much of the work of HABS/HAER is done by student teams during the summer, or as part of college-credit classwork. [[Eric DeLony]] headed HAER from 1971 to 2003.

In October 2000, NPS and the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] established a sister program, the Historic American Landscapes Survey, to systematically document historic American landscapes. A predecessor, the Historic American Landscape and Garden Project, recorded historic Massachusetts gardens between 1935 and 1940. That project was funded by the [[Works Progress Administration]], but was administered by HABS, which supervised the collection of records.

== {{Anchor|LoC}} Library of Congress ==
The permanent collection of HABS/HAER/HALS are housed at the [[Library of Congress]], which was established in 1790 (and reestablished after the disastrous fire of 1814 in [[History of Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C.]] by purchasing former third President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s personal library at [[Monticello]] in 1815) as the replacement reference library of the [[United States Congress]]. It has since been expanded to serve as the National Library of the United States; U.S. publishers are required to deposit a copy of every copyrighted and published work, book monograph and magazine. As a branch of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]], its created works are in the [[public domain]] in the US. Many images, drawings, and documents are available through the Prints and Photographs Online Catalog, including proposed, demolished, and existing structures; locales, projects, and designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Historic American Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record/Historic American Landscapes Survey | publisher = Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress | url = https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hh/ | access-date = 2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''History of the Lombards''''' or the '''''History of the Langobards''''' ({{lang-la|Historia Langobardorum}}) is the chief work by [[Paul the Deacon]], written in the late 8th century. This incomplete history in six books was written after 787 and at any rate no later than 796, maybe at [[Montecassino]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=964}}

The history covers the story of the [[Lombards]] from their mythical origins to the death of King [[Liutprand of Lombardy|Liutprand]] in 743, and contains much information about the [[Eastern Roman empire]], the [[Franks]], and others. The story is told from the point of view of a Lombard patriot and is especially valuable for its treatment of the relations between the Franks and the Lombards. As his primary sources, Paul used the document called the ''[[Origo gentis Langobardorum]]'', the ''[[Liber pontificalis]]'', the lost history of [[Secundus of Non|Secundus of Trent]], and the lost annals of [[Benevento]]; he also made free use of works by [[Bede]], [[Gregory of Tours]], and [[Isidore of Seville]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=964}}

==Editions==
According to a study made by Laura Pani in 2000, there are 115 surviving [[codex|codices]] of Paul's history. A popular work in the [[Middle Ages]], as indicated by the number of copies and their dissemination throughout Western Europe, more than twenty of these manuscripts predate the 11th century while another eighty or more were copied later.&lt;ref&gt;McKitterick 2004, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Hanoverae MDCCCLXXVII simply Hangover 1878.PNG|thumb|left|175px|The 1878 edition of Bethmann and Waitz]]
The relations between these manuscripts were studied by [[Georg Waitz]], who in 1876 identified 11 different families of the ''Historia Langobardorum''.&lt;ref&gt;McKitterick 2004, pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest manuscript is the [[Palimpsest]] of [[Assisi]], written in the [[uncial script]] towards the end of the 8th century, almost immediately after Paul's work was completed. This palimpsest is, however, far from complete, as it contains only parts of books II and V of Paul's history. The earliest complete manuscript is the ''Codex Sangallensis 635'' written sometime between the 8th and the 10th centuries and designated by Waitz as F1.&lt;ref&gt;Zanella 2007, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; According to Waitz, F1's age makes it the most reliable of the ''Historia'''s codices, a view which has been challenged by Antonio Zanella and Dante Bianchi, both of whom hold that the F1 does not correctly reflect Paul's original.&lt;ref&gt;Zanella 2007, pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Paulus - Historia Langobardorum, 1480 - 528076 Proemio.jpeg|thumb|''Historia Langobardorum'', 1480]]

Paul's account was largely accepted by subsequent writers, was often continued, and was first printed in Paris in 1514.  Among the printed editions of the Latin text, the most authoritative is that edited by [[Ludwig Konrad Bethmann]] and Georg Waitz and published in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]. Scriptores rerum langobardicarum et Italicarum'' (Hanover, 1878).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=964}}

==Translations==
It has been translated into English, German, French, Polish, Spanish, Swedish, Italian, [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], and Croatian, the English translation being by [[William Dudley Foulke|W.D. Foulke]] (Philadelphia, 1906), the German by O. Abel and R. Jacobi (Leipzig, 1878),{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=964}} the Polish by Ignacy Lewandowski (1995, Warszawa), Henryk Pietruszczak, (2002, Zgorzelec), the Spanish by P. Herrera (Cádiz, 2006), and the Swedish by Helge Weimarck (Stockholm, 1971).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4341">'''Johannes Fründ''' (''Hans Fründ'', ca. 1400&amp;ndash;1468) was a [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] clerk and chronicler.

Born and educated in [[Lucerne]], he was employed as a scribe in that city in 1429, working under [[Egloff Etterlin]].
In ca. 1430, he wrote about the ongoing [[Valais witch trials|witch-trials in Valais]].&lt;ref&gt;''Von den Hexen, so in Wallis verbrant wurdent'', extant in two versions, Luzern, Zentralbibl., BB 335, pp. 483-488 and  Strasbourg, Bibl. univ., Ms. 2. 935, ff. 162-164. See J. Hansen, ''Quellen und Untersuchungen zur Geschichte des Hexenwahns und der Hexenverfolgung im Mittelalter'' (1901), 533-537.
Editions:
&lt;!--Th. von Liebenau, ''Anz. schweiz. Gesch.'' N.F. 9, 1902/05,  135-138.
L. Weisz, ''Zeitschrift für schweizerische Kirchengeschichte'' 28, 1934, pp. 250-254.--&gt;
K. Utz Tremp, in: M. Ostorero et al. (eds.), ''L'imaginaire du sabbat'' (1999), pp. 30-44, 47-51.

From 1437 to 1453, he was state secretary (''Landschreiber'') of [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]]. In this function, he participated in several [[Swiss Diet]]s and also served as scribe on campaign during the [[Old Zürich War]] (1440–46). His chronicle on the Zürich War is essentially a contemporary eyewitness account.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Immanuel Kind, ''[https://archive.org/details/diechronikdesha00schwgoog Die Chronik des Hans Fründ, Landschreiber zu Schwytz]'' (1875).&lt;/ref&gt; Fründ appears to have contracted a serious illness in 1447 which prevented him from completing the chronicle, so the text does not cover the peace negotiations and final treaty of 1450.&lt;ref name=Kind_bio&gt;Kind (1875), [https://www.archive.org/stream/diechronikdesha00schwgoog/#page/n13/mode/2up p. III-IV].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fründ remained in Schwyz until 1457. In that year, he was again  employed by Lucerne in the office of court secretary (''Gerichtsschreiber'') after an unsuccessful application for the position of state secretary (''Stadtschreiber'').

Fründ was married three times, to Elli Bumbel, Adelheid von Tengen and Margaretha Giessmann. He died probably in 1468, and certainly before 10 March 1469. He appears to have had acquired some wealth, as there are records of a dispute over his inheritance between his third wife and his daughter from his second marriage.&lt;ref name=Kind_bio/&gt;

Fründ's chronicle is one of the main sources (alongside [[Conrad Justinger]]s  ''[[Bernese Chronicle]]'' of c. 1430) used in the [[Tschachtlanchronik]] of 1470. Similarly, [[Diebold Schilling the Elder]] used substantial portions of Fründ's text in his [[Berner Schilling|1483 chronicle]]. Although Fründ's text was widely received by way of the works of these later writers, his own authorship was mostly forgotten, and his own works misattributed. Fründ's chronicle was considered lost, and [[Heinrich Bullinger]] misattributed his text to one Ulrich Wagner. He was only remembered as a chronicler by [[Aegidius Tschudi]] ([[Chronicon Helveticum|c. 1550]]), who is otherwise not known as a very reliable witness. Fründ's identity and authorship was eventually recovered in [[Swiss historiography]] in the 1870s, first by Hungerbühler (1871), who however misattributed an early text on the [[Swiss Swedish origin legend]] to Fründ,&lt;ref&gt;the author of this text now being generally held to he  Heinrich von Gundelfingen, who wrote in c. 1470; see Egloff (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; the text of his chronicle being edited by Kind (1875).&lt;ref&gt;see Kind (1875) [https://www.archive.org/stream/diechronikdesha00schwgoog/#page/n17/mode/2up p. VII] on the authorship question.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains, first discovered in the pits in 1914, were the partial [[skeleton]] of a woman&lt;ref name="Merriam1914"&gt;{{aut|J.C.

The remains used to be on display in the [[George C. Page Museum]], alongside a life-sized model thought to resemble the woman. The exhibit was removed around 2004. The curator, John M. Harris, was concerned that this display of historic remains might offend Native Americans or attract unwanted attention to its Native American origins, thereby triggering a demand for their return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/20/magazine/tm-labrea34/2 |title=L.A.

'''Martin Brimmer''' (1829-January 14, 1896)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Obituary Record: Martin Brimmer|last=|first=|date=17 January 1896|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American politician and first president of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/brimmerm|title=Dictionary of Art Historians|website=arthistorians.info/|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brimmer was the son of [[Martin Brimmer]], [[Mayor of Boston]].  He started his studies at Harvard University and graduated in 1849.  He was a member of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] from 1859-1861 and the [[Massachusetts Senate|Massachusetts State Senate]] in 1864.  He was a [[Electoral College (United States)|presidential elector]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1876|US election of 1876]].  He also served on the Citizens' Relief Committee following the [[Great Boston fire of 1872]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''package insert''' is a document included in the [[Drug packaging|package]] of a [[medication]] that provides information about that drug and its use.  For [[prescription medication]]s, the insert is [[Technical writing|technical]], and provides information for [[Health professional|medical professionals]] about how to prescribe the drug. Package inserts for prescription drugs often include a separate document called a "patient package insert" with information written in [[Plain English|plain language]] intended for the [[end-user]] -- the person who will take the drug or give the drug to another person, for example a minor.  Inserts for [[over-the-counter medication]]s are also written plainly.&lt;ref name=Nathan&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nathan |first1=Joseph P. |last2=Vider |first2=Etty |title=The Package Insert |journal=US Pharm. |date=2015 |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=8-10. |url=https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/the-package-insert |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nadine Vanlaer |title=Drug Package Inserts: the Letter of the Law - Packaging Gateway |url=https://www.packaging-gateway.com/features/feature755/ |work=Packaging Gateway |date=August 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US the document is called "prescribing information" or the "package insert" (PI) and layperson's document is called the "patient package insert" (PPI).&lt;ref name=Nathan/&gt;  In Europe the technical document is called the "'''summary of product characteristics'''" and the document for end-users is called the "package leaflet".&lt;ref name=EMA&gt;{{cite web |title=Marketing authorisation - Product-information requirements |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/general/general_content_000199.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac0580022bb3 |publisher=European Medicines Agency |accessdate=18 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsible agencies==
Each country or region has their own regulatory body.  

In the European Union, the [[European Medicines Agency]] has jurisdiction and the relevant documents are called the  "summary of product characteristics" (SPC or SmPC) and the document for end-users is called the "package leaflet". The SPC is not intended to give general advice about treatment of a condition but does state how the product is to be used for a specific treatment. It forms the basis of information for health professionals to know how to use the specific product safely and effectively. The package leaflet supplied with the product is aimed at end-users.&lt;ref name=EMA/&gt;

[[File:Drug Package Insert (FDA 115) (8206409270).jpg|thumb|right|cartoon depicting the package insert as overly long and complicated]]
In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) determines the requirements for patient package inserts.  In the United States, the FDA will occasionally issue revisions to previously approved package inserts, in much the same way as an auto manufacturer will issue [[Product recall|recalls]] upon discovering a problem with a certain car.  The list of 1997 drug labelling changes can be found on the FDA's website, [http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/1997/dec97.htm here]. The first patient package insert required by the FDA was in 1968, mandating that [[isoproterenol]] inhalation medication must contain a short warning that excessive use could cause breathing difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;33 Fed. Reg. 8812 (1968) (codified at 21 C.F.R. §201.305)&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=August 2018}}  The second patient package insert required by the FDA was in 1970, mandating that [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s must contain information for the patient about specific risks and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;33 Fed. Reg. 9001 (1970) (codified at 21 C.F.R. §310.510)&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=August 2018}}  The patient package insert issue was revisited in 1980 and in 1995 without conclusive action being taken.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060905155817/http://leda.law.harvard.edu/leda/data/85/bschuman.rtf] Finally, in January 2006, the FDA released a major revision to the patient package insert guidelines, the first in 25 years.[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2005/NEW01272.html] The new requirements include a section called Highlights which summarizes the most important information about benefits and risks; a Table of Contents for easy reference; the date of initial product approval; and a [[toll-free number]] and Internet address to encourage more widespread reporting of information regarding suspected adverse events.

Other national or international organizations that regulate medical information include the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare]] (MHLW). Other country-specific agencies, especially in the case of EU ([[European Union]]) countries and candidates, plus countries of South America and many in Asia and the Far East, rely heavily on the work of these three primary regulators.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Sections of a package insert==
[[Package insert]]s follow a standard format for every medication and include the same types of information.  Different manufacturers may have different titles for their sections, however, to make them easier for the average person to read and comprehend—for example, instead of "Contraindications" the section may be headed, "Who should not take this medication?" 

The first thing listed is usually the brand name and generic name of the product.  The other sections are as follows:

* [[Clinical pharmacology]] - tells how the medicine works in the body, how it is absorbed and eliminated, and what its effects are likely to be at various concentrations.  May also contain results of various [[clinical trial]]s (studies) and/or explanations of the medication's effect on various populations (e.g. children, women, etc.).
* Indications and usage - uses (indications) for which the drug has been FDA-approved (e.g. migraines, seizures, high blood pressure). Physicians legally can and often do prescribe medicines for purposes not listed in this section (so-called "[[off-label use]]s").
* [[Contraindications]] - lists situations in which the medication should ''not'' be used, for example in patients with other medical conditions such as kidney problems or allergies
* Warnings - covers possible serious [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] that may occur
* Precautions - explains how to use the medication safely including physical impairments and drug interactions; for example "Do not drink alcohol while taking this medication" or "Do not take this medication if you are currently taking [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOI inhibitors]]"
* Adverse reactions - lists ''all'' side effects observed in all studies of the drug (as opposed to just the dangerous side effects which are separately listed in "Warnings" section)
* Drug abuse and dependence - provides information regarding whether prolonged use of the medication can cause [[physical dependence]] (only included if applicable)
* Overdosage - gives the results of an [[overdose]] and provides recommended action in such cases
* Dosage and administration - gives recommended dosage(s); may list more than one for different conditions or different patients (e.g., lower dosages for children)
* How supplied - explains in detail the physical characteristics of the medication including color, shape, markings, etc., and storage information (e.g., "Store between 68 and 78°F ")


==Other uses and initiatives==
In addition to the obvious use of inclusion with medications, package inserts have been used or provided in other forms.  In the United States, the package inserts for thousands of prescription medicines are available at the [[DailyMed]] website, provided by the National Library of Medicine: http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov South Africa has taken the initiative of making all package inserts available electronically via the internet, listed by trade name, [[International Nonproprietary Name|generic name]], and classification, and Canada is working on a similar capability. The UK-based [http://emc.medicines.org.uk electronic Medicines Compendium] provides freely available online access to both Patient Information Leaflets (intended for consumers) and [[Summary of Product Characteristics]] (aimed at healthcare professionals) for products available in the UK.

Patient information is, understandably, usually generated initially in the native language of the country where the product is being developed.  This leads to inconsistency in format, terminology, tone, and content.  PILLS (Patient Information Language Localisation System) is a one-year effort by the [[European Commission]] to produce a prototype tool which will support the creation of various kinds of medical documentation simultaneously in multiple languages, by storing the information in a database and allowing a variety of forms and languages of output.

In 2004, the small company obtained an investment of $500,000 from [[Glen Meakem]], who became the Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Review, rankings site College Prowler joins Niche group|date=October 4, 2014|first=Deborah|last=Todd|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/business/businessnews/2013/10/04/Review-rankings-site-College-Prowler-joins-Niche-group/stories/201310040092page=all|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=October 17, 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, College Prowler was recognized by [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] for being one of the 50 fastest-growing companies in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=2005 Fast 50 Winner|date=March 1, 2005|first=|last=|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1172796/most-innovative-companies-2005/27luke-skurman|publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|accessdate=April 22, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929002216/http://www.fastcompany.com/1172796/most-innovative-companies-2005/27luke-skurman|archivedate=September 29, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the company produced print guidebooks, but by 2007 their content was made available online for a [[Subscription business model|subscription fee]], and then by 2009 the subscription was removed making all [[web content]] free.&lt;ref name="Inc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=College Prowler soars after making switch to business model|date=August 12, 2011|first=Malia|last=Spencer|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/print-edition/2011/08/12/college-prowler-soars-business-model.html?page=all|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Business Times]]|accessdate=April 22, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516072332/http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/print-edition/2011/08/12/college-prowler-soars-business-model.html?page=all|archivedate=May 16, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the CEO, "The original purpose was to use these groups as a way to inform students that they can access a free guide about their new college on our site." He also added, "No employee or anyone else associated with College Prowler has used these groups to send out messages or wall posts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Company-Created/42157/|title=Company Created Official-Looking 'Class of 2013' Facebook Groups for Hundreds of Colleges|author=|date=19 December 2008|website=chronicle.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110174411/https://www.chronicle.com/article/Company-Created/42157|archivedate=10 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; College Prowler later removed all administrative access from the 125 groups, admitting "It was clearly over the line".

'''Novell Vibe''' is a web-based team collaboration platform developed by [[Novell]], and was initially released by Novell in June 2008 under the name of Novell Teaming. Novell Vibe is a collaboration platform that can serve as a knowledge repository, [[document management system]], project collaboration hub, process automation machine, corporate [[intranet]] or [[extranet]]. Users can upload, manage, comment on, and edit content in a secure manner. Supported content includes documents, calendars, discussion forums, wikis, blogs, tasks, and more.

Document management functionality allows for document versions, approvals, and document life cycle tracking. Users can download and modify pre-built custom web pages and workflows free of charge from the Vibe Resource Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novell.com/products/vibe/resource-library/ |title=Novell Vibe Resource Library |publisher=Novell.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Novell Vibe is the result of a merging of two products in November 2010: Novell Teaming and Novell Pulse.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novell.com/communities/node/12257/great-vibes-paths-merging-novell-teaming-and-novell-pulse&lt;/ref&gt;

Novell Teaming began as SiteScape Forum. When Novell Acquired SiteScape in 2008, the name was changed to Novell Teaming.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Created in 2009, Novell Pulse was a communication tool based on the [[Google Wave Federation Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scala-lang.org/node/6618&lt;/ref&gt;

===Server===
Any combination of Linux and Windows servers can run the Vibe application. Furthermore, MySQL, MS SQL, and Oracle databases are supported.

===End-User operating systems===
Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS or Android

===Browsers===
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, or Chrome

===Mobile===
Any mobile device that has a browser can access the Vibe site. Native iOS&lt;ref&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/novell-vibe/id476653054?mt=8&lt;/ref&gt; and Android&lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.novell.vibe.android&lt;/ref&gt; apps are available for free download in the app stores.

===Microsoft Office integration===
Word, PowerPoint, and Excel (versions 2013,2010 and 2007) on the Windows operating system are supported.

==Interoperability==
Vibe can be used in conjunction with various other software products, such as [[Novell Access Manager]], [[Novell GroupWise]], [[Skype]], and [[YouTube]]. Novell Vibe integrates with an LDAP directory for authentication.

==Extendability==
Vibe administrators can extend the Vibe software by creating [[software extensions]], remote applications, or [[JAR (file format)]] files that enhance the power and usefulness of the Vibe software to create a custom experience for users.

Software extensions enable third-party developers to create abilities which extend an application. Vibe administrators or Vibe developers can create custom extensions (add-ons) to enhance Vibe. For example, you might have an extension that enables Flash video support in Vibe.

===Remote applications===
A remote application is a program that runs on a remote server and delivers data for use on the Novell Vibe site (such as data from a remote database). For example, Vibe administrators or Vibe developers could set up a remote application for Twitter that displays all of a user's Twitter entries in Vibe.

Unlike creating an extension for Vibe, creating a remote application does not modify the Vibe software.

== Open-source solutions ==
Not all of these projects implement all of the features Novell Vibe has to offer as well as Vibe is missing some features these products have:

* [[Kablink|Kablink Vibe]] - an open source version of Novell Vibe
* [[Redmine]]/[[ChiliProject]]
* [[trac]]
* [[Feng Office Community Edition]]
* [[Open Workbench]]
* [[OpenProj]]
* [[Kune (software) |Kune]]

A '''pin-back button''' or '''pinback button''', '''pin button''', '''button badge''', or simply '''pin-back''' or '''badge''', is a [[Button (clothing)|button]] or [[badge]] that can be temporarily [[fasten]]ed to the surface of a [[garment]] using a [[safety pin]], or a [[pin]] formed from [[wire]], a [[clutch (pin fastener)|clutch]] or other [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]]. This fastening mechanism is anchored to the back side of a button-shaped metal disk, either flat or concave, which leaves an area on the front of the button to carry an image or printed message. The word is commonly associated with a [[campaign button]] used in the United States and abroad during a [[political campaign]]. The first design for a pin-back button in the United States was patented in 1896, and contemporary buttons have many of the same design features.

==History==
[[File:US patent 564356 partial.png|thumb|right|'''Badge Pin or Button''', US patent (1896)&lt;ref name="pin-back" /&gt;]]
[[File:Pin-back button assembly.png|thumb|right|Two assembled pin-back buttons (top) and disassembled (bottom) with two different wire pins]]
Political buttons have been used in the United States since the first [[United States presidential inauguration|presidential inauguration]] in 1789, when George Washington's supporters wore buttons imprinted with a [[slogan]]. These early buttons were sewn to the lapel of a coat or worn as a [[pendant]] on a string.&lt;ref name="zip"&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Button was Born: Pinback Button Badge History|url=http://zippypins.com/button-born|accessdate=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first campaign buttons with photographs of  were produced to promote the [[Party platform|political platform]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1860.&lt;ref name="zip"/&gt;

Benjamin S. Whitehead patented the first innovation to the design in 1893 by inserting a sheet of transparent film made of [[celluloid]] over a photograph mounted on a [[badge]] to protect the image from scratches and abrasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|493003}}[http://www.put-a-pin.pt.vu .] "Device for Displaying Photographs" by Benjamin S. Whitehead, issued {{Date|7 March 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead had patents for various designs of ornamental badges and [[medal]]lions previously, patented as early as 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|476939}} Emblematic Society Badge and Rosette" Benjamin S. Whitehead, issued {{Date|June 14, 1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another patent was issued to Whitehead &amp; Hoag on {{date|21 July 1896}} for a "Badge Pin or Button" which used a metal pin anchored to the back of the button to fasten the badge.
&lt;blockquote&gt;My present invention has reference to improvements in badges for use as lapel pins or buttons, or other like uses, and has for its primary object to provide ... a novel means for connecting the ornamental shell or button to the bar or pin for securing the badge to the lapel of the coat.&lt;ref name="pin-back"&gt;{{US patent|564356}} "Badge Pin or Button" by George B. Adams Assignor for Whitehead &amp; Hoag Company of New Jersey, issued {{Date|July 21, 1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other improvements and modifications to the basic design were patented in the following years by other inventors.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|653150}} "Badge-button and Pin-back Therefor" by Augustus Phelps, issued {{Date|3 July 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|773419}} "Backing for Display Buttons", issued {{Date|Oct 25, 1904}} by David Pudlin&lt;/ref&gt;

Early pin-back buttons from 1898 were printed with a popular [[cartoon]] character, [[The Yellow Kid]], and offered as [[Prize (marketing)|prizes]] with chewing gum or tobacco products to increase sales.

These buttons were produced with a concave opening on the back side (which provided space to insert advertising), or with a closed back, filled with metal insert and fastener. These are called "open back" and "closed back" buttons.

In 1945, the [[Kellogg Company]], the pioneer in [[cereal box prize]]s, inserted prizes in the form of pin-back buttons into each box of [[Pep Cereal]].  Pep pins have included U.S. Army squadrons as well as characters from newspaper comics.  There were 5 series of comic characters and 18 different buttons in each set, with a total of 90 in the collection.

A '''resource map''' (ReM) is a concept of the [[Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange|ORE Model]] for associating an identity with compound digital objects (aggregations of digital resources) and making assertions about their structure and semantics. Compound objects combine distributed resources, including multiple media types. 

==ReM Serialization==
A Resource Map may be [[serialization|serialized]] (or represented) in several different formats including [[Atom feed]]s, [[RDF/XML]], [[RDFa]], and others.  

The example below illustrates how a ReM can represent the [[arXiv]] [[e-print]] at https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0601007 using an Atom feed. Metadata such as the [[digital object identifier]], title, and authors for the e-print are included first in the Atom feed. The e-print is a compound digital object composed of five aggregated resources which are listed next: [[OAI-PMH]] [[metadata]] about the e-print, a [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0601007 splash page], a [https://arxiv.org/ps/astro-ph/0601007 PostScript version] of the e-print, a [https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0601007 PDF version], and a [https://arxiv.org/e-print/astro-ph/0601007 gzipped tar file] containing multiple versions of the e-print.

'''''Roget's Thesaurus''''' is a widely used English-language [[thesaurus]], created in 1805 by [[Peter Mark Roget]] (1779–1869), British [[physician]], [[natural theologian]] and [[lexicographer]]. It was released to the public on 29 April 1852.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Roget's Thesaurus
Werner Hüllen  http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199254729.001.0001/acprof-9780199254729&lt;/ref&gt; The original edition had 15,000 [[word]]s, and each new [[edition (book)|edition]] has been larger.&lt;ref name=karpeles&gt;[http://www.rain.org/~karpeles/rogetdis.html Roget's Thesaurus] Karcpeles Library&lt;/ref&gt;  Roget was inspired by the [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] teachings of Jeremy Bentham and wished to help "those who are painfully groping their way and struggling with the difficulties of composition [...] this work processes to  hold out a helping hand" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to be Really Well Informed in Minutes: All you need to know about everything that matters from the popular 'Briefing' columns|last=The Week|first=|publisher=Ebury Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-09194-706-4|location=Croydon|pages=74-77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Karpeles [[Karpeles Manuscript Library Museum|Library Museum]] houses the original manuscript in its collection.&lt;ref name=karpeles/&gt;

The name "Roget" is [[trademark]]ed in parts of the world, such as the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/domestic?domesticnum=2055476 Case details for Trade Mark 2055476]&lt;/ref&gt;  By itself, it is not protected in the United States, where use of the name "Roget" in the title of a thesaurus does not necessarily indicate any relationship to Roget directly; it has come to be seen as a [[Genericized trademark|generic]] thesaurus name.&lt;ref&gt;"The name has become synonymous with the ''Thesaurus'', yet Dr Roget himself is a shadowy figure." Lloyd 1982, p.xiii&lt;/ref&gt; With it's hegemonic status, it became "a mark of civility". [[J. M. Barrie|J.M. Barrie]] stated "[&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Captain Hook]]] is not wholly evil [h]e has a Thesaurus in his cabin" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Indeed, [[Sylvia Plath]] considered it her [[Desert Island Discs|desert island]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;book over the [[Bible]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Roget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded. Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my own deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd 1982, p.xix&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Roget's Thesaurus'' is composed of six primary classes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://poets.notredame.ac.jp/Roget/contents.html Table of contents]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316070554/http://poets.notredame.ac.jp/Roget/contents.html |date=March 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each class is composed of multiple divisions and then sections. This may be conceptualized as a tree containing over a thousand branches for individual "meaning clusters" or semantically linked words. Although these words are not strictly [[synonyms]], they can be viewed as colours or connotations of a meaning or as a spectrum of a concept. One of the most general words is chosen to typify the spectrum as its headword, which labels the whole group.

Roget's schema of classes and their subdivisions is based on the philosophical work of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (see [[Leibniz#Symbolic thought|Leibniz—Symbolic thought]]), itself following a long tradition of [[epistemological]] work starting with [[Aristotle]]. Some of [[Aristotle's Categories]] are included in Roget's first class "abstract relations". 

The book is updated regularly and each edition is heralded as a gauge to contemporary terms; but each edition keeps true to the original classifications established by Roget. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Naturally, it has critics calling it a book for the 'lexically lazy'. [[Simon Winchester]] believes it has allowed a "state of linguistic and intellectual mediocrity". &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whilst Robert McNeil used the Thesaurus to rewrite, satirically for [[The Scotsman]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], the 'nunnery scene': "To vegetate or not to exist, that  is the knotty point. Whether 'tis haughtier in the cerebellum to grin and bear the pea-shooters and harpoons of unmentionable serendipity ..."   thus  highlighting the book's lost art form. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Tate Modern''' is a [[modern art]] gallery located in London. It is Britain's national gallery of international modern art and forms part of the [[Tate]] group (together with [[Tate Britain]], [[Tate Liverpool]], [[Tate St Ives]] and [[Tate Online]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/|title=History and development ''Tate On-line''|work=Tate Etc.|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based in the former [[Bankside Power Station]], in the [[Bankside]] area of the [[London Borough of Southwark]]. Tate holds the national collection of British art from 1900 to the present day and international modern and contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about|title=About|work=Tate Etc.|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tate Modern is one of the [[list of largest art museums|largest]] museums of modern and contemporary art in the world. As with the UK's other national galleries and museums, there is no admission charge for access to the collection displays, which take up the majority of the gallery space, while tickets must be purchased for the major temporary exhibitions.

==History==

===Bankside Power Station===
{{main article|Bankside Power Station}}
[[File:Tate modern london 2001 03.jpg|thumb|250px|The Turbine Hall]]
Tate Modern is housed in the former [[Bankside Power Station]], which was originally designed by Sir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]], the architect of [[Battersea Power Station]], and built in two stages between 1947 and 1963. It is directly across the river from [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. The power station closed in 1981.

Prior to redevelopment, the power station was a {{Convert|200|m|abbr=on}} long, [[steel frame]]d, brick [[Cladding (construction)|clad]] building with a substantial central chimney standing {{Convert|99|m|abbr=on}}. The structure was roughly divided into three main areas each running east-west – the huge main [[Turbine Hall]] in the centre, with the [[Mechanical room|boiler house]] to the north and the switch house to the south.

===Initial redevelopment===
For many years after closure Bankside Power station was at risk of being demolished by developers.  Many people campaigned for the building to be saved and put forward suggestions for possible new uses. An application to [[listed building|list]] the building was refused. In April 1994 the [[Tate]] Gallery announced that Bankside would be the home for the new Tate Modern. In July of the same year, an international competition was launched to select an architect for the new gallery. Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron of [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]] were announced as the winning architects in January 1995. The £134&amp;nbsp;million conversion to the Tate Modern started in June 1995 and completed in January 2000.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/10439829.Tate_Modern_builders_win___400m_Battersea_Power_Station_contract/|title=Tate Modern builders Carillion win £400m Battersea Power Station contract|publisher=Your local Guardian|date=23 May 2013|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most obvious external change was the two-story glass extension on one half of the roof. Much of the original internal structure remained, including the cavernous main turbine hall, which retained the overhead travelling crane. An [[electrical substation]], taking up the Switch House in the southern third of the building, remained on-site and owned by the French power company [[EDF Energy]] while Tate took over the northern Boiler House for Tate Modern's main exhibition spaces.

[[File:Panoramic view from Tate Modern balcony.JPG|300px|thumb|Panoramic view from Tate Modern balcony]]
The history of the site as well as information about the conversion was the basis for a 2008 documentary ''Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building &amp; Tate Modern''. This challenging conversion work was carried by [[Carillion]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Opening and initial reception===
Tate Modern was opened by [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] on 11 May 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/8/newsid_2519000/2519069.stm|title=2000: Sneak preview of new Tate Modern|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tate Modern received 5.25&amp;nbsp;million visitors in its first year. The previous year the three existing Tate galleries had received 2.5&amp;nbsp;million visitors combined.&lt;ref name="artreview"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tate Modern. Nought to Sixteen. A History|journal=Art Review|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extension project===

Tate Modern had attracted more visitors than originally expected and plans to expand it had been in preparation since 2004. These plans focused on the south west of the building with the intention of providing 5,000m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of new display space, almost doubling the amount of display space.&lt;ref name=guide&gt;Tate Guide, August–September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/projects/tate-modern-project/vision|title=Vision|work=Tate Etc.|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern third of the building was retained by the French power company [[EDF Energy]] as an [[electrical substation]]. In 2006, the company released the western half of this holding&lt;ref name="EDF"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/arts/design/26tate.html|title=Tate Modern Announces Plans for an Annex|work=The New York Times|date=26 July 2006|accessdate=26 July 2006|first=Alan|last=Riding}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plans were made to replace the structure with a tower extension to the museum, initially planned to be completed in 2015. The tower was to be built over the old oil storage tanks, which would be converted to a performance art space. Structural, geotechnical, civil, and façade engineering and environmental consultancy was undertaken by [[Ramboll]] between 2008 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tate Modern extension|url=http://www.ramboll.com/projects/ruk/tate-modern|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This project was initially costed at £215&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2285488,00.html Tate Modern's chaotic pyramid], ''[[The Times]]'', 26 July 2006. Retrieved 26 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the money raised, £50&amp;nbsp;million came from the UK government; £7&amp;nbsp;million from the [[London Development Agency]]; £6&amp;nbsp;million from philanthropist [[John Studzinski]]; and donations from, among others, the Sultanate of Oman and [[Elisabeth Murdoch (businesswoman)|Elisabeth Murdoch]].&lt;ref&gt;Farah Nayeri (20 April 2012), [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-20/murdoch-s-daughter-elisabeth-gives-tate-at-least-1-dot-6-mln Murdoch’s Daughter Elisabeth Gives Tate at Least $1.6 Mln]''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, international shipping and property magnate [[Eyal Ofer]] pledged £10m to the extension project, making it to 85% of the required funds. Eyal Ofer, chairman of London-based Zodiac Maritime Agencies, said the donation made through his family foundation would enable "an iconic institution to enhance the experience and accessibility of contemporary art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pickford |first=James |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/73bfec0c-e32f-11e2-bd87-00144feabdc0.html |title=Eyal Ofer donates £10m to Tate Modern extension |work=Financial Times |date=2 July 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tate director, Nicholas Serota, praised the donation saying it would help to make Tate Modern a "truly twenty-first-century museum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Brown, arts correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/02/tate-modern-gift-eyal-ofer |title=Tate Modern receives £10m gift from Israeli shipping magnate Eyal Ofer &amp;#124; Art and design |work=The Guardian |date= 2 July 2013|accessdate=12 January 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Tanks====
The first phase of the expansion involved the conversion of three large, circular, underground oil tanks originally used by the power station into accessible display spaces and facilities areas. These opened on 18 July 2012 and closed on 28 October 2012&lt;ref name="artreview"/&gt; as work on the tower building continued directly above. They reopened following the completion of the Switch House extension on 17 June 2016.

Two of the Tanks are used to show live [[performance art]] and installations while the third provides utility space.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; Tate describes them as "the world's first museum galleries permanently dedicated to live art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tanks-tate-modern/eventseries/tanks-art-action|title=The Tanks: Art in Action|work=Tate Etc.|accessdate=8 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104132030/http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tanks-tate-modern/eventseries/tanks-art-action|archivedate=4 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Switch House====
[[File:Tate Modern Switch House (27633103611).jpg|thumb|Exterior of the Switch House]]
A ten-storey tower, 65 metres high from ground level, was built above the oil tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/file/tate-modern-project-environmental-statement-non-technical-summary|title=Environmental Statement non-technical summary|work=Tate Etc.|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original western half of the Switch House was demolished to make room for the tower and then rebuilt around it with large gallery spaces and access routes between the main building and the new tower on level 1 (ground level) and level 4. The new galleries on level 4 have natural top lighting. A bridge built across the turbine hall on level 4 to provides an upper access route.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;

The new building opened to the public on 17 June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/special-event/new-tate-modern-opening-weekend|title=The new Tate Modern opening weekend – Special Event at Tate Modern|website=Tate Etc.|access-date=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design, again by [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]], has been controversial. It was originally designed with a glass stepped pyramid, but this was amended to incorporate a sloping façade in brick latticework (to match the original power-station building)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=10122|title=Tate Modern extension redesigned|publisher=Worldarchitecturenews.com|date=18 July 2008|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite planning consent to the original design having been previously granted by the supervising authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.london.gov.uk/mayor/planning_decisions/strategic_dev/2007/20070509/tate_modern_bankside_report.pdf|title=Tate Modern extension, Bankside|publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=25 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819083439/http://legacy.london.gov.uk/mayor/planning_decisions/strategic_dev/2007/20070509/tate_modern_bankside_report.pdf|archive-date=19 August 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extension provides 22,492 square metres of additional gross internal area for display and exhibition spaces, performance spaces, education facilities, offices, catering and retail facilities as well as a car parking and a new external public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inexhibit.com/case-studies/tate-modern-expansion-herzog-de-meuron/|title=Tate Modern extension by Herzog &amp; de Meuron architects|publisher=Inexhibit|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017 the Switch House was formally renamed the Blavatnik Building, after Anglo-Ukrainian billionaire Sir [[Leonard Blavatnik]], who contributed a "substantial" amount of the £260m cost of the extension.  Sir Nicholas Serota commented "Len Blavatnik's enthusiastic support ensured the successful realisation of the project and I am delighted that the new building now bears his name".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hannah Ellis-Petersen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/04/tate-modern-names-extension-after-oligarch-donor-len-blavatnik |title=Tate Modern names extension after billionaire Len Blavatnik &amp;#124; Art and design |work=The Guardian |accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galleries==
The collections in Tate Modern consist of works of international modern and [[contemporary art]] dating from 1900 until today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern|title=Tate Modern|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levels 2, 3 and 4 contain gallery space. Each of those floors is split into a large east and west wing with at least 11 rooms in each. Space between these wings is also used for smaller galleries on levels 2 and 4. The Boiler House shows art from 1900 to the present day.&lt;ref name="map"&gt;Tate Modern Visitor Map June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The Switch House has eleven floors, numbered 0 to 10. Levels 0, 2, 3 and 4 contain gallery space. Level 0 consists of the Tanks, spaces converted from the power station's original fuel oil tanks, while all other levels are housed in the tower extension building constructed above them. The Switch House shows art from 1960 to the present day.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;

The Turbine Hall is a single large space running the whole length of the building between the Boiler House and the Switch House. At six stories tall it represents the full height of the original power station building. It is cut by bridges between the Boiler House and the Switch House on levels 1 and 4 but the space is otherwise undivided. The western end consists of a gentle ramp down from the entrance and provides access to both sides on level 0. The eastern end provides a very large space that can be used to show exceptionally large artworks due its unusual height.

==Exhibitions==

=== Collection exhibitions ===
[[File:Tate.modern.interior.london.arp.jpg|thumb|right|A gallery at Tate Modern.]]
The main collection displays consist of 8 areas with a named theme or subject. Within each area there are some rooms that change periodically showing different works in keeping with the overall theme or subject. The themes are changed less frequently. There is no admission charge for these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern#visit|title=Tate Modern|last=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2016 the themed areas were:&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;
* ''Start Display'': A three-room display of works by major artists to introduce the basic ideas of modern art.
* ''Artist and Society''
* ''In The Studio''
* ''Materials and Objects''
* ''Media Networks''
* ''Between Object and Architecture''
* ''Performer and Participant''
* ''Living Cities''

There is also an area dedicated to displaying works from the [[Artist Rooms]] collection.

==== History of the collection exhibitions ====
[[File:Tate Modern.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Chimney of Tate Modern. The ''Swiss Light'' at its top was designed by [[Michael Craig-Martin]] and the architects [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]] and was sponsored by the Swiss government. It was dismantled in May 2008.]]

Since the Tate Modern first opened in 2000, the collections have not been displayed in chronological order but have been arranged thematically into broad groups. Prior to the opening of the Switch House there were four of these groupings at a time, each allocated a wing on levels 3 and 5 (now levels 2 and 4).

The initial hanging from 2000 to 2006:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/tate-modern-collection-2000|title=Tate Modern: Collection 2000 – Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/tate-modern-collection-2003|title=Tate Modern: Collection 2003 – Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''History/Memory/Society''
* ''Nude/Action/Body''
* ''Landscape/Matter/Environment''
* ''Still Life/Object/Real Life''

The first rehang at Tate Modern opened in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/tate-modern-launches-first-major-rehang-its-collection-support-ubs|title=Tate Modern launches first major rehang of its Collection with the support of UBS – Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/CollectionDisplays?venueid=2|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080316122625/http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/CollectionDisplays?venueid=2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 March 2008|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT] UK Government Web Archive – The National Archives|first=Internet Memory|last=Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; It eschewed the thematic groupings in favour of focusing on pivotal moments of twentieth-century art. It also introduced spaces for shorter exhibitions in between the wings. The layout was:

[[File:Whiteread tate 1.jpg|thumb|[[Rachel Whiteread]], ''EMBANKMENT'' (2005)]]

The Turbine hall, which once housed the electricity generators of the old power station, is five storeys tall with 3,400 square metres of floorspace.&lt;ref name="the_guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/arts/features/story/0,11710,1587112,00.html|title=Profile: Rachel Whiteread|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=7 October 2005|accessdate=20 April 2006|first=Xan|last=Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to display large specially-commissioned works by contemporary artists, between October and March each year. 

From 2000 until 2012, the series was named after its corporate sponsor, [[Unilever]]. In this time the company provided £4.4m sponsorship in total including a renewal deal of £2.2m for a period of five years agreed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris (14 August 2012), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tate+seeks+new+sponsor+for+Turbine+Hall+commissions/27009 Tate seeks new sponsor for Turbine Hall commissions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605020631/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tate+seeks+new+sponsor+for+Turbine+Hall+commissions/27009 |date=5 June 2013 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
This series was planned to last the gallery's first five years, but the popularity of the series led to its extension until 2012.&lt;ref name="artinfo.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/27060/dominique-gonzalez-foerster-chosen-for-tate-moderns-turbine-hall/|title=Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster Chosen for Tate Modern's Turbine Hall|accessdate=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Tate Modern signed a sponsorship deal worth around £5&amp;nbsp;million with [[Hyundai]] to cover a ten-year program of commissions, then considered the largest amount of money ever provided to an individual gallery or museum in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;xMartin Bailey (20 January 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tate-signs-m-sponsorship-with-Hyundai/31578 Tate signs £5m sponsorship with Hyundai] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122185549/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tate-signs-m-sponsorship-with-Hyundai/31578 |date=22 January 2014 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The first commission for the Hyundai series is Mexican artist, [[Abraham Cruzvillegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/hyundai-commission-2015-abraham-cruzvillegas|title=Hyundai Commission 2015: Abraham Cruzvillegas|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When there is no series running, the Turbine Hall is used for occasional events and exhibitions. In 2011 it was used to display [[Damien Hirst]]'s ''[[For The Love of God]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/damien-hirsts-iconic-love-god-be-shown-tate-moderns-turbine-hall|title=Damien Hirst's iconic For the Love of God to be shown in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall|work=Tate Etc.|date=21 November 2011|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a sell out show by [[Kraftwerk]] in February 2013 crashed the ticket hotline and website, causing a backlash from the band's fans.

====Major temporary exhibitions====
Two wings of the Boiler House are used to stage the major temporary exhibitions for which an entry fee is charged. These exhibitions normally run for three or four months. When they were located on a single floor, the two exhibition areas could be combined to host a single exhibition. This was done for the [[Gilbert and George]] retrospective due to the size and number of the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/gilbert-george|title=Gilbert &amp; George – Tate|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the two wings used are on level 3. It is not known if this arrangement is permanent. Each major exhibition has a dedicated mini-shop selling books and merchandise relevant to the exhibition.

A 2014 show of [[Henri Matisse]] provided Tate Modern with London's best-attended charging exhibition, and with a record 562,622 visitors overall, helped by a nearly five-month-long run.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Pes and Emily Sharpe (2 April 2015), [http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/17584/ Visitor figures 2014: the world goes dotty over Yayoi Kusama] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420033842/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/17584/ |date=20 April 2015 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, [[Joan Jonas]] had a retrospective exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/13/joan-jonas-review-tate-modern|title=Joan Jonas review – post-internet confusion before the internet|date=13 March 2018|work=The Guardian|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tanks, located on level 0, are three large underground oil tanks, connecting spaces and side rooms originally used by the power station and refurbished for use by the gallery. One tank is used to display installation and video art specially commissioned for the space while smaller areas are used to show installation and video art from the collection.

====Project Space====
The Project Space (formerly known as the Level 2 Gallery) was a smaller gallery located on the north side of the Boiler House on level 1 which housed exhibitions of contemporary art in collaboration with other international art organisations. Its exhibitions typically ran for 2–3 months and then travelled to the collaborating institution for display there. The space was only accessible by leaving the building and re-entering using a dedicated entrance. It is no longer used as gallery space.

====Other areas====
Works are also sometimes shown in the restaurants and members' rooms. Other locations that have been used in the past include the mezzanine on Level 1 and the north facing exterior of the Boiler House building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/street-art|title=Street Art – Tate|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other facilities==
In addition to exhibition space there are a number of other facilities:
* A large performance space in one of the tanks on level 0 used to show a changing programme of performance works for which there is sometimes an entrance charge.
* The Starr Auditorium and a seminar room on level 1 which are used to show films and host events for which there is usually an entrance charge.
* The Clore Education Centre, Clore Information Room and McAulay Studios on level 0 which are facilities for use by visiting educational institutions.
* One large and several small shops selling books, prints and merchandise.
* A cafe, an espresso bar, a restaurant and bar and a members' room.
* Tate Modern community garden, co-managed with [[Bankside Open Spaces Trust]]

== Access and environs ==
[[File:Wobbly bridge 120600.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tate Modern on the opening day of the [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]] in 2000]]
The closest station is [[Blackfriars station|Blackfriars]] via its new south entrance. Other nearby stations include [[Southwark tube station|Southwark]], as well as [[St. Paul's tube station|St Paul's]] and [[Mansion House tube station|Mansion House]] north of the river which can be reached via the [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]]. The lampposts between Southwark tube station and Tate Modern are painted orange to show pedestrian visitors the route.

There is also a [[Thames Clippers|riverboat]] pier just outside the gallery called [[Bankside Pier]], with connections to the [[London Docklands|Docklands]] and [[Greenwich]] via regular passenger boat services (commuter service) and the Tate to Tate service, which connects Tate Modern with Tate Britain.

To the west of Tate Modern lie the sleek stone and glass Ludgate House, the former headquarters of [[Express Newspapers]] and [[Sampson House]], a massive late [[Brutalist]] office building.

==Controversies==

===''Liberate Tate'' from BP===
Since 2010 there have been 14 protest [[Performance art|art performances]] by the art collective ''[[Liberate Tate]]'' demanding the Tate to "disengage from [[BP]] as a sponsor, and stop allowing Tate to be used to deflect attention away from the devastating impacts that BP has around the world." BP is criticised for operations in relation with [[Petroleum exploration in the Arctic]], the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]], [[Oil sands]] and [[climate change]]. The artists involved in the protests are referring to a deal between BP and the Tate: BP pays £224,000 a year to the Tate. The Tate presents the brand BP in return. In June 2015 a group of artists occupied Tate Modern for 25 hours.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/14/tate-modern-climate-activists-bp-protest Climate activists leave Tate Modern after all-night protest against BP]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'’[https://liberatetate.wordpress.com/liberating-tate/open-letter-to-nicholas-serota/ Liberate Tate]'’&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Testseek''' is a [[review site]] and [[review aggregator]] launched in [[Sweden]] in 2008. Testseek is a global provider of reviews in all major languages to ecommerce portals and retailers to help consumers make better buying decisions.

== History ==
In the first years, Testseek was mainly focussed on exploiting its own web portal. Gradually the focus has shifted towards business-to-business services, enabling the websites of manufacturers and their channel partners by providing expert and user reviews, and award logos. In 2013, Netvalue (majority owner of [[Open ICEcat]]) joined as shareholder, and helped to expand the customer base.

'''''The Atlas of the DC Universe''''' by [[Paul Kupperberg]] was published in 1990 by [[Mayfair Games]] as a supplement to its [[DC Heroes]] role-playing game. It includes maps and information about locations in the [[DC Universe]]; for example, it places [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] in Delaware and [[Gotham City]] in [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maphead: Charting the Wide, Weird World of Geography Wonks |last=Jennings |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Jennings |year=2011 |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] |location= |isbn=978-1-4391-6717-5 |page=112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZkKRmFRXPsC |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
''The Atlas of the DC Universe'' was designed to serve both as a gaming material for the DC Heroes role-playing game, published by Mayfair, and a stand alone "in-universe" reference book for the fans of DC Comics. Many of the cities, such as Metropolis and Star City, were given exact locations on maps provided within the book.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1FI_sMJ1ZuZhfl80pkAPlWNarmU4&amp;hl=en_US&lt;/ref&gt;

Maps of the galaxy, and other important planets within the DC universe are also included.&lt;ref&gt;https://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=2878&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Guide to Modern World Literature''''' is a reference book by [[Martin Seymour-Smith]] that aims to describe every important 20th-century author (as of 1985), in all languages, in an encyclopedic presentation.&lt;ref name=marcuse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-10-13/books/bk-15771_1_world-literature |title=The New Guide to Modern World Literature by Martin Seymour-Smith (Peter Bedrick/Harper &amp; Row: $60; 1,413 pp.) |work=[[LA Times]] |author=Michael J.

The book covers an estimated 2,700 authors and more than 7,500 titles.&lt;ref name=marcuse/&gt; It contains a total of 33 chapters that treat all modern national literatures individually or in groups.&lt;ref name=marcuse/&gt; African and Caribbean literature is treated collectively; so are the Baltic, French and Belgian, Indian and Pakistani, Jewish, Latin American, Scandinavian, and both Eastern and Western Minor Literatures.&lt;ref name=marcuse/&gt; A chapter each is given to American, Arabic, Australian, British, Bulgarian, Canadian, Chinese, Czechoslovakian, Dutch, Finnish, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, New Zealand, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, South African, Spanish, Turkish, and Yugoslavian Literature.&lt;ref name=marcuse/&gt;

It was perhaps Seymour-Smith's best known work.&lt;ref name=lyall/&gt; "The book was such a thorough study of 20th-century poetry, drama and fiction that some critics doubted it was the work of one person -- until they read it and found Mr. Seymour-Smith's distinctive voice and deeply felt opinions in every entry.".&lt;ref name=lyall&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/19/arts/martin-seymour-smith-70-critic-biographer-and-poet.html |title=Martin Seymour-Smith, 70, Critic, Biographer and Poet |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Sarah Lyall |date=July 19, 1998 |accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described by one reviewer as "an amazing feat of a book, about half a million words long; half the size of Proust, nearly as big as the Bible".&lt;ref name=nye/&gt; Janet Seymour-Smith, his wife, helped in the creating of the work - "when some expressed incredulity that Martin could actually have read all the authors on whom he passed judgement in that vast but so lively volume he used, cheerfully, to confess that he hadn't.

'''''The Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit''''' is a ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' animated short film, produced and released on August 10, 1962. It was the ninth of the thirteen cartoons in a series of thirteen to be directed by [[Gene Deitch]] and produced by [[William L. Snyder]] in [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beck|first=Jerry|author-link=Jerry Beck|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/animationscoop/warner-bros-home-entertainment-to-release-tom-jerry-the-gene-deitch-collection-dvd-on-june-2nd-20150206|title=Warner Bros.

''The Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit'' is a sarcastic attack on the series as a whole and its formulaic approach, which the short mocks as excessively violent and designed solely for profit.&lt;ref name="Deitch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/genedeitch/chapter-twentyone-tom-and-jerry-the-first-reincarnation|title=Tom &amp; Jerry: The First Reincarnation|work=How To Succeed in Animation|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|year=2001|last=Deitch|first=Gene|accessdate=September 27, 2009 | archivedate= September 14, 2014| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914223444/http://www.awn.com/genedeitch/chapter-twentyone-tom-and-jerry-the-first-reincarnation | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deitch had strongly divergent views on animation compared to ''Tom and Jerry's'' creators, [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]], that he has openly expressed throughout his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/genedeitch/chapter-twentyeight-a-tangled-web|title=How to Succeed in Animation: Chapter 28: A Tangled Web|author=Gene Deitch|publisher=Animation World Network|date=2001|accessdate=September 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The cartoon begins with a demonstration for the Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit, with which "anyone can now enter the lucrative field of animated cartoons." The items in the kit include the following:

*"One mean, stupid cat" (Tom)
*"One sweet (innocent), lovable mouse" (Jerry)
*"Assorted deadly weapons" (a [[knife]], a [[hammer]], and a stick of [[dynamite]])
*[[Coffee]] and [[cigarettes]] (removed from the kit and described as being "for the health of cartoonists")
*A slice of [[watermelon]]

The narrator says, "First, put the sweet, lovable mouse into a simple situation expressing a natural human need, such as eating a slice of watermelon contained in our kit. The result may not make sense, but it will last long enough for you to be comfortably seated before the feature begins." This statement refers to the original theatrical exhibition of the cartoon, in which it ran ahead of a feature film.

At first, Jerry eats the watermelon and spits the seeds out, hitting and waking Tom, who initially grabs the hammer to attempt to hit Jerry but instead flicks him in the back of his head. Jerry swallows the seeds by accident, causing him to turn green for a moment and then make sounds like a [[maraca|shaker]] when he moves, and goes into a lively dance until Tom traps him in a metal can. Tom uses Jerry as a maraca for his own dance; when the effect suddenly stops, Tom peeks inside only to get a mouthful of seeds spat into his face. He gets very mad and devours the rest of the watermelon and turns his head into a cannon to fire blasts of seeds at Jerry, who takes cover in the kit box just before Tom hits it, blowing up the stick of dynamite and destroying the box.

Jerry winds up lying beneath a book named ''[[Judo]] for Mice'', studies it, and emerges with enough fighting skill to easily overpower Tom. Even a stint of training at a [[boxing]] [[gym]] and use of the knife do not give Tom any advantage against Jerry. Finally Tom goes to a [[judo]] school in order to face him again. The two have a [[breaking (martial arts)|breaking]] contest, in which each tries to outdo the other: Jerry with a wooden board, Tom with a brick, then Jerry again with a cement block. The contest ends abruptly when Tom tries to break a huge block of heavy [[marble]], which crashes through the floor and takes him with it.

An unconscious Tom ends up in the battered box. Jerry replaces the lid as the narrator pipes up, "Our next film will be for the kiddies, and will demonstrate a new poison gas. Thank you and good night." The words on the lid say "The End, an MGM cartoon" like an ending typical of a Deitch Tom and Jerry short. The music winds to stop as if it was being played on a slowing phonograph record, and Jerry bows to the audience in typical Japanese fashion, as the gong is sounded, making  the screen fade to black.

==Reception==
*While the Deitch shorts were generally negatively-received by ''Tom and Jerry'' fans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nessel|first=Jen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/09/movies/made-in-prague-bound-for-the-us.html?pagewanted=2|title=Made In Prague, Bound for the U.S.|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|page=2|date=August 9, 1998|quote='All the experts say they're the worst of the 'Tom and Jerry's,' Mr. Deitch readily admitted.|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; this particular short is often considered one of the best of the thirteen cartoons, due to its inventive plotline and satirical nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/cartoons-considered-for-an-academy-award-1961/ Cartoons Considered For An Academy Award-1961-Cartoon Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15235">[[File:BambergApocalypseFolio027v2ProphetsAndBeastFromAbyss.JPG|right|thumb|The two witnesses, as depicted in the [[Bamberg Apocalypse]], an 11th-century [[illuminated manuscript]].]]
In the [[Book of Revelation]], the '''two witnesses''' are two of God's prophets who are seen in a vision by [[John of Patmos]], who appear during the ''Second woe'' recorded in {{bibleverse||Revelation|11:1-14|NKJV}}. They have been variously identified by [[Christian eschatology|theologian]]s as two individuals, as two groups of people, or as two concepts. [[Dispensationalist]] Christians believe that the events described in the Book of Revelation will occur before and during the [[Second Coming of Christ]], and they attempt to associate references in the Book of Revelation with historical or current happenings and people.

== Biblical narrative ==
John is told that the court of God's temple would be trampled on by the nations for 42 months. During that period for 1,260 days (or 42 months, or 3½ years), two witnesses would be granted authority to prophesy. They are described as ''two olive trees'' and ''two lampstands'' who stand before the Lord of the earth. Both are able to devour their enemies with fire that flows out of their mouths. Also, they have power over the sky and waters and are able to strike the earth with plague.

After their testimony, ''[[The Beast (Revelation)|the Beast]]'' overcomes the two witnesses and kills them. For three and a half days, the people of the earth celebrate the two witnesses' death (who have tormented them for three and a half years) and will not permit the witnesses a proper burial. After this time, God [[resurrection|resurrects]] the two witnesses; their resurrection strikes fear on everyone witnessing their revival, and the two witnesses then ascend to [[heaven]]. In the next hour, a great earthquake occurs and kills 7000 men, destroying a tenth of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Revelation|11:1-13|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Textual analysis ==
[[File:Revelation 11 THE TWO WITNESSES.JPG|thumb|''These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth.'' Revelation 11:4]]
According to the text, the ''two witnesses'' are symbolised as the "two olive trees and the two lampstands" that have the power to destroy their enemies, control the weather and cause plagues.&lt;ref name='rev114'&gt;{{Bibleverse|Revelation||11:4-6|131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their description as "two olive trees and two lampstands" may be [[symbol]]ism, [[allegory]], or [[literal and figurative language|literal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preceptaustin.org/tool_commentary.htm |title=Bible Commentaries |accessdate=2007-06-27 |date=2007-06-07 |publisher=Precept Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identity ==
In attempting to [[Biblical exegesis|interpret]] [[Revelation 11]], commentators who hold to a premillennial eschatology generally interpret the two witnesses in one of three ways: (1) as individuals either manifested in some form of [[reincarnation]]; or "in the spirit" of biblical prophets who once appeared in Bible history; or simply as two individuals newly arrived on the earth; (2) as corporate in nature (human) standing for the Church only or for Israel only; or both Israel and the Church; or for both Jewish and Gentiles believers in Jesus; or (3) as symbolism or an expression of biblical concepts (i.e., the Old and New Testaments; the Law and the Prophets;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hitchcock|1999|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercy and Grace).

=== Literalist view ===
The literalist typically has a [[dispensationalist]] or [[futurist]] interpretation that the ''two witnesses'' will be actual people who will appear in the [[End time|Last days]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walvoord|1999|p=574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hitchcock|1999|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are varying views as to the identity of the ''two witnesses''.

[[Early Christian]] writers such as [[Tertullian]], [[Irenaeus]], and [[Hippolytus of Rome]], have concluded that the two witnesses would be [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] and [[Elijah]], prophets who did not die because God "took" them according to other Biblical passages.

Others have proposed [[Moses]] as one of the witnesses, for his ability to turn water into blood and the power to plague the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hitchcock|1999|pp=121–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern theologians, such as [[John Walvoord]], have furthered the point of individualism by comparing the "two lampstands" and the "two olive trees" of ''Revelation'' 11 to the ''two golden pipes'' and ''two olive trees/branches'' of ''[[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]]'' 4. By the identification of the ''two olive branches'' as "two anointed ones" or "two sons of the oil", in Zechariah, this reinforces the [[literal and figurative language|literalist]] interpretation that the two witnesses are two people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hitchcock|1999|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[personification]] of the ''two witnesses'' in ''Revelation'' is so prevalent that according to theologian [[William Barclay (theologian)|William Barclay]], the passage seems to refer to definite persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barclay|2004|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walvoord further pointed out that because the ''Revelation'' passage does not specifically identify who the ''two witnesses'' are, it would be safer to conclude that they are not related to any previous historical character.

=== Christian symbolism ===
{{Christian Eschatology}}
The ''two witnesses'' have been interpreted as representing the Church or a similar concept. The ''[[Geneva Bible|1599 Geneva Study Bible]]'' has asserted that the two witnesses are the exclusive purview of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/geneva-study-bible/revelation/revelation-11.html|title=Revelation 11|publisher=Geneva Study Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew Henry]]'s ''Complete Commentary on the Whole Bible'' gives one church interpretation as consisting of believing Jews and that of the [[Gentile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/revelation/11.html?p=2|title=Revelation 11|author= Matthew Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wesley]] in his commentary on Revelation 11 suggests a more spiritual, almost ambiguous, application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.crosswalk.com/Commentaries/WesleysExplanatoryNotes/wes.cgi?book=re&amp;chapter=011|title=Revelation 11|author=John Wesley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill's]] ''Exposition of the Bible'' interprets the two witnesses as the true Church in counterdistinction to the antichrist system of Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.crosswalk.com/Commentaries/GillsExpositionoftheBible/gil.cgi?book=re&amp;chapter=011&amp;verse=003&amp;next=004&amp;prev=002|title= Revelation 11:3|author=John Gill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross Taylor's ''Verse by Verse Commentary on Revelation'' clearly defines the Church as the "two olive trees and the two lampstands."

Similarly, the two witnesses have been identified as Israel and the Christian Church. The number ''two'' has been associated with the witness of Israel to the Gentile nations during the [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks|70th Week of Daniel's prophecy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bullinger |first=E. W. |title=Number in Scripture: Its Supernatural Design and Spiritual Significance |origyear=1921 |url=http://philologos.org/__eb-nis/two.htm |accessdate=2007-12-24 |edition=4th ed. rev. |year=2001 |publisher=Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode (Bible Warehouse) |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The olive tree in the Scripture signifies Israel. The "witness of the Church" is signified by the two lampstands, whose identity was disclosed by the seven golden lampstands (i.e., candlesticks) revealed in Revelation 2-3 as the "churches." Revelation 2:1 refers to the churches as golden lampstands.

It has also been proposed that the ''two witnesses'' are the [[Evangelism|witnessing church]], because Jesus sent out his disciples "two by two".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apocalipsis.org/downloads/revelatn.pdf |title=Revelation: A Reference Commentary |accessdate=2007-06-26 |last=Taylor |first=R A |date=2000-03-17 |format=PDF |pages=111–112 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222600/http://www.apocalipsis.org/downloads/revelatn.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other views ===
In the [[Seventh-day Adventist]] interpretation, [[Uriah Smith]] and [[Ellen G. White]] considered the ''two witnesses'' to be the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tagnet.org/cyberspace/Lessons/Fut-057/fut1-057.html|title=If I Were Told the Future — Lesson 57: The Two Witnesses |accessdate=2007-06-26 |year=2002 |work=Cyberspace Ministry |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070618100357/http://www.tagnet.org/cyberspace/Lessons/Fut-057/fut1-057.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteestate.org/books/gc/gc15.html|title=The Great Controversy, Chapter 15|publisher=|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.champs-of-truth.com/books/dr/rev_chapter_xi.htm|title=Revelation Chapter XI|publisher=|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that the [[French Revolution]] was the time when the "two witnesses" were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.539 - "But 'the triumphing of the wicked is short;' so was it in France, for their war on the Bible and Christianity had well-nigh swallowed them all up. They set out to destroy Christ's 'two witnesses,' but they filled France with blood and horror, so that they were horror-struck at the result of their wicked deeds, and were glad to remove their impious hands from the Bible"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, p.265. "The war against the Bible, carried forward for so many centuries in France, culminated in the scenes of the Revolution."&lt;/ref&gt; Other Historicists consider the Two Witnesses also in this way.&lt;ref&gt;''The Seventh Vial'', Dr J. A. Wylie, p.105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Roberts (Christadelphian)|Roberts, R.]] (1880), [http://www.leicester-christadelphians.org.uk/Glenhills/Revelation/Thirteen%20Lectures%20on%20the%20Apocalypse.pdf ''Thirteen Lectures on the Apocalypse'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] teaches that the two witnesses would be two prophets on a mission to the Jews in the modern nation of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/77.15#14|title=Doctrine and Covenants 77:15|publisher=|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orson Pratt, Journal of Discourses 16:329&lt;/ref&gt; possibly two members of their [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve]] or their [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-69-80/section-77-questions-and-answers-on-the-book-of-revelation?lang=eng: "No doubt they will be members of the Council of the Twelve or of the First Presidency of the Church," Bruce R. McConkie&lt;/ref&gt; who are considered to be prophets by the church. Some members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints claim that [[Joseph Smith]] and his brother [[Hyrum Smith]], Assistant President from 1841-1844, are the two witnesses in Revelation 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Stoddard, James F.

The Testimony of the Two Witnesses website declares that [[Prophecy of the Popes#Petrus Romanus|Peter the Roman]] will be one of the two witnesses of the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://testimonyofthetwowitnesses.com/THE-LAST-POPE.php|title=The Two Witnesses share their Testimony with the World|publisher=|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The two witnesses play a central role in the supernatural drama television series ''[[Sleepy Hollow (TV series)|Sleepy Hollow]]''.&amp;nbsp; The first witness is [[Ichabod Crane]] ([[Tom Mison]]), a [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]] soldier who, after battling with the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse#Pale Horse|Horseman of Death]] (whom he causes to be [[Headless Horseman (Legend of Sleepy Hollow)|headless]]), awakens in Sleepy Hollow in 2013.&amp;nbsp; The second witness is [[List of Sleepy Hollow characters#Lt. Grace Abigail "Abbie" Mills|Lieutenant Abbie Mills]] ([[Nicole Beharie]]), a contemporary woman in law enforcement who helps Crane adjust to the 21st century and aids him in battling dæmonic forces.&amp;nbsp; The two witnesses must face 'Seven Tribulations' (although other characters note that the Witnesses are only required to ''witness'' the events rather than take action themselves), the first being [[Moloch]], the master of the Horsemen.&amp;nbsp; The second Tribulation is [[Pandora]] and her master, an ancient [[Sumer]]ian god known as the Hidden One.&amp;nbsp; Although Lieutenant Mills (now Agent Mills of the F.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;I.) loses her soul, there must always be two witnesses, and the mantle passes on to [[List of Sleepy Hollow characters#Molly Thomas|Molly Thomas]] ([[Oona Yaffe]]) on her eleventh birthday.&amp;nbsp; Not long thereafter, Molly's older self, going by the name Lara ([[Seychelle Gabriel]]), comes from the future to aid Crane in his battles, thereby assuming the mantle of the witness from her younger self.

In the ''[[Left Behind]]'' franchise, the two witnesses prophesy at the [[Wailing Wall]] in Jerusalem. They are later revealed to be [[Elijah]] and [[Moses]], and are killed by the [[Antichrist]] [[Nicolae Carpathia]].

'''WYSIWYG''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|z|i|w|ɪ|ɡ}} {{respell|WIZ|ee-wig}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wysiwyg | title=Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1) | accessdate=9 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[acronym]] for "'''what you see is what you get'''".  In [[computing]], a WYSIWYG editor is a system in which content (text and graphics) can be edited in a form closely resembling its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|
url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0963250|title=Oxford English Dictionary: WYSIWYG|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a printed document, web page, or slide presentation.

==Meaning==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
[[Image:Lorem Ipsum - WYSIWYG en Latex - tekst als paden.svg|thumb|The program on the left uses a WYSIWYG editor to produce a [[Lorem Ipsum]] document. The program on the right contains [[LaTeX]] code, which when compiled will produce a document that will look very similar to the document on the left. Compilation of formatting code is not a WYSIWYG process.]]

WYSIWYG implies a [[user interface]] that allows the user to view something very similar to the end result while the document is being created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alex-ivanovs/wysiwyg-website-builders_b_8814882.html|title=WYSIWYG Website Builders for Online Business|date=15 December 2015|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, WYSIWYG implies the ability to directly manipulate the [[page layout|layout]] of a document without having to type or remember names of layout commands.&lt;ref name="foldoc" /&gt; The actual meaning depends on the user's perspective, e.g.
* In [[presentation program]]s, [[compound document]]s, and [[Web browser|web pages]], WYSIWYG means the display precisely represents the appearance of the page displayed to the end-user, but does not necessarily reflect how the page will be printed unless the printer is specifically matched to the editing program, as it was with the [[Xerox Star]] and early versions of the [[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]].
* In word processing and [[desktop publishing]] applications, WYSIWYG means that the display simulates the appearance and represents the effect of fonts and line breaks on the final pagination using a specific [[computer printer|printer configuration]], so that, for example, a citation on page 1 of a 500-page document can accurately refer to a reference three hundred pages later.&lt;ref name="Chamberlin1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamberlain|first=Donald D.|title=Document convergence in an interactive formatting system|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=31|issue=1|pages=59|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/311/ibmrd3101F.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2008|doi=10.1147/rd.311.0058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* WYSIWYG also describes ways to manipulate 3D models in [[stereo-chemistry]], [[computer-aided design]], and [[3D computer graphics]].

Modern software does a good job of optimizing the screen display for a particular type of output. For example, a [[word processor]] is optimized for output to a typical printer. The software often emulates the resolution of the printer in order to get as close as possible to WYSIWYG. However, that is not the main attraction of WYSIWYG, which is the ability of the user to be able to visualize what they are producing.

In many situations, the subtle differences between what the user sees and what the user gets are unimportant. In fact, applications may offer multiple WYSIWYG modes with different levels of "realism", including
* A composition mode, in which the user sees something somewhat similar to the end result, but with additional information useful while composing, such as section breaks and non-printing characters, and uses a layout that is more conducive to composing than to layout.
* A layout mode, in which the user sees something very similar to the end result, but with some additional information useful in ensuring that elements are properly aligned and spaced, such as margin lines.
* A preview mode, in which the application attempts to present a representation that is as close to the final result as possible.

==History==
[[Image:Xerox 8010 compound document.jpg|thumb|right|Compound document displayed on [[Xerox Star|Xerox 8010 Star]] system]]
Before the adoption of WYSIWYG techniques, text appeared in editors using the system standard [[typeface]] and style with little indication of layout ([[margin (typography)|margins]], spacing, etc.). Users were required to enter special non-printing ''control codes'' (now referred to as markup ''code tags'') to indicate that some text should be in [[boldface]], [[italic type|italics]], or a different [[typeface]] or size. In this environment there was very little distinction between [[text editor]]s and [[word processor]]s.

These applications typically used an arbitrary [[markup language]] to define the codes/tags. Each program had its own special way to format a document, and it was a difficult and time-consuming process to change from one word processor to another.

The use of markup tags and codes remains popular today in some applications due to their ability to store complex formatting information. When the tags are made visible in the editor, however, they occupy space in the unformatted text and so disrupt the desired layout and flow.

[[Bravo (software)|Bravo]], a document preparation program for the [[Alto (computer)|Alto]] produced at [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]] by [[Butler Lampson]], [[Charles Simonyi]] and colleagues in 1974, is generally considered the first program to incorporate WYSIWYG technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computer.org/web/computingnow/annals/extras/wordvol28n4|title=Computing Now}}&lt;/ref&gt; displaying text with formatting (e.g. with justification, fonts, and proportional spacing of characters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/the-real-history-of-wysiwyg/?_r=0|title=The Real History of WYSIWYG|first=John|last=Markoff|date=|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alto monitor (72 [[pixels per inch|PPI]], based on the [[Point (typography)|typographic unit]]) was designed so that one full page of text could be seen and then printed on the first [[laser printer]]s. When the text was laid out on the screen, 72 PPI font metric files were used, but when printed 300 PPI files were used—thus one would occasionally find characters and words slightly off, a problem that continues to this day.

Bravo was released commercially and the software eventually included in the [[Xerox Star]] can be seen as a direct descendant of it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brad A. Myers]]. [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~amulet/papers/uihistory.tr.html A Brief History of Human Computer Interaction Technology.] ACM interactions. Vol. 5, no. 2, March, 1998. pp. 44–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel with but independent of the work at Xerox PARC, [[Hewlett Packard]] developed and released in late 1978 the first commercial WYSIWYG software application for producing overhead slides or what today are called presentation graphics. The first release, named [[BRUNO]] (after an HP sales training puppet), ran on the [[HP 1000]] minicomputer taking advantage of HP's first bitmapped computer terminal the [[HP 2640]]. [[BRUNO]] was then ported to the HP-3000 and re-released as "HP Draw".

By 1981 [[MicroPro]] advertised that its [[WordStar]] word processor had WYSIWYG,&lt;ref name="byte198103"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-03/1981_03_BYTE_06-03_Programming_Methods#page/n269/mode/2up | title=Can your word processor pass this screen test? | work=BYTE | date=March 1981 | accessdate=18 October 2013 | author=Advertisement | pages=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its display was limited to displaying [[styled text]] in WYSIWYG fashion; '''bold''' and ''italic'' text would be represented on screen instead of surrounded by tags or special [[control characters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/in-the-beginning-there-was-the-word-processor/|title=In the beginning, there was the word processor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 the ''[[Weekly Reader]]'' advertised its [[Stickybear]] educational software with the slogan "what you see is what you get", with photographs of its Apple II graphics,&lt;ref name="softline198301"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1983&amp;pub=6&amp;id=9 | title=What You See Is What You Get | work=Softline | date=January 1983 | accessdate=2014-07-27 | pages=10–11 | type=advertisement}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[home computer]]s of the 1970s and early 1980s lacked the sophisticated graphics capabilities necessary to display WYSIWYG documents, meaning that such applications were usually confined to limited-purpose, high-end workstations (such as the [[IBM Displaywriter System]]) that were too expensive for the general public to afford. Towards the mid-1980s, however, things began to change. Improving technology allowed the production of cheaper bitmapped displays, and WYSIWYG software started to appear for more popular computers, including [[LisaWrite]] for the [[Apple Lisa]], released in 1983, and [[MacWrite]] for the [[Apple Macintosh]], released in 1984.

The [[Apple Macintosh]] system was originally designed so that the [[display resolution|screen resolution]] and the resolution of the [[ImageWriter]] [[dot-matrix printer]]s sold by Apple were easily scaled: 72 PPI for the screen and 144 [[dots per inch|DPI]] for the printers. Thus, the scale and dimensions of the on-screen display in programs such as [[MacWrite]] and [[MacPaint]] were easily translated to the printed output—if the paper were held up to the screen, the printed image would be the same size as the on screen image, but at twice the resolution. As the ImageWriter was the only model of printer physically compatible with the Macintosh printer port, this created an effective closed system. Later, when Macs using external displays became available, the resolution was fixed to the size of the screen to achieve 72 DPI. These resolutions often differed from the VGA-standard resolutions common in the PC world at the time. Thus, while a Macintosh {{convert|15|in|cm|adj=on}} monitor had the same 640&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;480 resolution as a PC, a {{convert|16|in|cm|adj=on}} screen would be fixed at 832&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;624 rather than the 800&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;600 resolution used by PCs. With the introduction of third-party dot-matrix printers as well as [[laser printer]]s and [[multisync]] monitors, resolutions deviated from even multiples of the screen resolution, making true WYSIWYG harder to achieve.

In 2012, Wikipedia offered a WYSIWYG editor called [[VisualEditor]], which allowed edits of Wikipedia to be performed without seeing the page source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/22/3110130/wikimedia-visual-editor-prototype|title=Wikimedia releases updated prototype for simplified visual editor - The Verge|date=22 June 2012|work=The Verge|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The phrase "what you see is what you get", from which the acronym derives, was a [[catchphrase]] popularized by [[Flip Wilson]]'s drag persona [[Geraldine Jones (character)|Geraldine]], first appearing in September 1969, then regularly in the early 1970s on ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]''. The phrase was a statement demanding acceptance of Geraldine's entire personality and appearance.

Furthermore, multiple hit songs and albums debuted in 1971 that could have also contributed to popularizing this phrase, including [[What You See Is What You Get (song)|What You See Is What You Get]] by Stoney &amp; Meatloaf, [[Stand by Me (Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get)]] by Bernard Purdie and [[Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get]] by The Dramatics.

As it relates to computing, there are multiple claims to first use of the phrase:
* In mid-1975, [[John W. Seybold]], the founder of Seybold Publications, and researchers at [[PARC (company)|PARC]], incorporated [[Gypsy (software)|Gypsy software]] into [[Bravo (software)|Bravo]] to create Bravo 3, which allowed text to be printed as displayed. [[Charles Simonyi]] and the other engineers appropriated Flip Wilson's popular phrase around that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hiltzik|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Hiltzik|title=Dealers of Lightning: Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age|publisher=[[HarperBusiness]]|year=1999|page=200|isbn=0-88730-891-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Go To|last=Lohr|first=Steve|year=2001|publisher=Basic Books|location=|isbn=0-465-04226-0|page=128|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XfPLVx6qS_cC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Geraldine+Jones+What+You+See+Is+What+You+Get+intitle:Go+intitle:To#v=onepage&amp;q=Geraldine%20Jones%20What%20You%20See%20Is%20What%20You%20Get%20intitle%3AGo%20intitle%3ATo&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Barbara Beeton reports that the term was coined by Bill Tunnicliffe in a presentation at a 1978 committee meeting involving the Graphic Communications Association (GCA), the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS), and the Printing Industries of America (PIA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last1=Flynn|first1=Peter |title=Human Interfaces to Structured Documents |date=2014 |publisher=[[University College Cork]] |location=Ireland |page=40 footnote 10 |url=https://cora.ucc.ie/bitstream/handle/10468/1690/Human-Interfaces-to-Structured-Documents.pdf#page=69 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The phrase was coined in 1982&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; by Larry Sinclair, an engineer at [[Information International, Inc.]] ("Triple I") to express the idea that what the user sees on the screen is what the user gets on the printer while using the "page layout system", a pre-press typesetting system first shown at ANPS in Las Vegas.{{When|date=January 2011}}
* In c.1974, Karen Thacker, the technophobe wife of [[Xerox]] hardware designer [[Charles P. Thacker|Charles "Chuck" Thacker]] was introduced to a [[Xerox Alto]] running [[Bravo (software)|Bravo]], and commented, “You mean, what I see is what I get?”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/the-real-history-of-wysiwyg/|title=The Real History of WYSIWYG|last=Markoff|first=John|website=Bits Blog|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Because designers of WYSIWYG applications typically have to account for a variety of different output devices, each of which has different capabilities, there are a number of problems that must be solved in each implementation. These can be seen as tradeoffs between multiple design goals, and hence applications that use different solutions may be suitable for different purposes.

Typically, the design goals of a WYSIWYG application may include the following:
* Provide high-quality printed output on a particular printer
* Provide high-quality printed output on a variety of printers
* Provide high-quality on-screen output
* Allow the user to visualize what the document will look like when printed
* Allow the user to visualize what the website will look like when published 
It is not usually possible to achieve all of these goals at once.

The major problem to be overcome is that of varying output resolution. As of 2016, monitors typically have a resolution of between 102 and 125 pixels per inch. Printers generally have resolutions between 240 and 1440 pixels per inch; in some printers the horizontal resolution is different from the vertical. This becomes a problem when trying to lay out text; because older output technologies require the spacing between characters to be a whole number of pixels, rounding errors will cause the same text to require different amounts of space in different resolutions.

Solutions to this include the following:
* Always laying out the text using a resolution higher than the user is likely to use in practice. This can result in poor quality output for lower resolution devices (although techniques such as [[spatial anti-aliasing]] may help mitigate this), but provides a fixed layout, allowing easy user visualisation. This is the method used by [[Adobe Acrobat]].
* Laying out the text at the resolution of the printer on which the document will be printed. This can result in low quality on-screen output, and the layout may sometimes change if the document is printed on a different printer (although this problem occurs less frequently with higher resolution printers, as rounding errors are smaller). This is the method used by [[Microsoft Office Word|Microsoft Word]].
* Laying out the text at the resolution of a specific printer (in most cases the default one) on which the document will be printed using the same font information and kerning. The character positions and number of characters in a line are exactly similar to the printed document.
* Laying out the text at the resolution for the output device to which it will be sent. This often results in changes in layout between the on-screen display and printed output, so is rarely used. It is common in web page designing tools that claim to be WYSIWYG, however.

Other problems that have been faced in the past include differences in the fonts used by the printer and the on-screen display (largely solved by the use of downloadable font technologies like [[TrueType]]) and differences in color profiles between devices (mostly solved by printer drivers with good color model conversion software).

Apart from these issues, the practice of WYSIWYG itself has been condemned as distracting from the writing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html|title=Word Processors: Stupid and Inefficient}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=March 2018}}

'''Zeal''' was a volunteer-built [[web directory]], first appearing in 1999, and then acquired by [[LookSmart]] in October 2000 for $20 million. Zeal combined the work of Looksmart's paid editors with that of [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s who profiled websites and placed them in a [[hierarchy]] of [[Categorization|subcategories]].  The resulting categories and profiles were downloaded at intervals by LookSmart and its partners, other search companies such as [[MSN]], [[Lycos]], and [[Altavista]], for use in their own systems with or without modification.

Paid editors attended to commercial sites and oversaw the voluntary work on non-commercial sites.

Volunteers worked under a defined set of Guidelines and were required to pass an introductory level test on those Guidelines before submitting site profiles or edits.  As points and experience were acquired, volunteers could elect to take a further exam which allowed them to "adopt" and create topic categories of special interest.  They could then move up the organizational structure from Community Member to Zealot to Expert Zealot, acquiring additional tools and oversight responsibility at each level.  Expert Zealots, who could move or delete some whole categories, monitored the day-to-day operations of the non-commercial portion of the directory and acted as mentors to new members.

Active volunteers were found in many English-speaking countries (particularly [[North America]], [[United Kingdom]], [[India]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]) and some other countries such as [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Japan]].

By March 2003, Zeal had passed the 250,000 listings mark; eventually it passed the 400,000 mark due, in part, to the Zeal Charity Drive contest of October 2003, which saw over $25,000 distributed around prominent charities such as [[WWF (conservation organization)|WWF]]. 

After Looksmart's acquisition of Zeal, its internet traffic as measured by [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] fluctuated considerably; after MSN withdrew from the related partnership, Zeal traffic declined from "usually better than 2000th" (mid-2003) to "about 5000th" (mid-2004).

Branch offices in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom were closed in about 2004, and the corresponding directories were said to have been sold but/and were gradually merged with the main directory.

Zeal closed on 28 March 2006.
