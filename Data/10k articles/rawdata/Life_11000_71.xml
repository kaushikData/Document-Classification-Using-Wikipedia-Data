The '''aardvark''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑːr|d|v|ɑːr|k|}} {{respell|ARD|vark}}; ''Orycteropus afer'') is a medium-sized, burrowing, [[nocturnal]] [[mammal]] native to [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only living [[species]] of the order [[Tubulidentata]],&lt;ref name="MSW3"&gt;{{harvnb|Schlitter|2005|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known. Unlike other [[insectivore]]s, it has a long [[pig]]-like snout, which is used to sniff out food. It roams over most of the southern two-thirds of the African continent, avoiding areas that are mainly rocky. A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs. It also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young. It receives a "least concern" rating from the [[IUCN]], although its numbers seem to be decreasing.

==Naming and taxonomy==

=== Naming ===
The aardvark is sometimes colloquially called "African ant bear",&lt;ref name="Colliers"&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|1997|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; "anteater" (not to be confused with the [[anteater|South American anteater]]), or the "Cape anteater"&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; after the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The name "aardvark" ({{IPA-af|ˈɑːrtfark}}) comes from earlier [[Afrikaans]] (erdvark)&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; and means "earth [[pig]]" or "ground pig" (''aarde'': earth/ground, ''vark'': pig), because of its burrowing habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"aardvark, n." ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, March 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/22. Accessed 24 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Orycteropus'' means burrowing foot, and the name ''afer'' refers to Africa.&lt;ref name=sho/&gt; The name of the aardvarks's order, ''Tubulidentata,'' comes from the tubule-style teeth.&lt;ref name=sho1&gt;{{harvnb|Shoshani|2002|p=619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxonomy ===
The aardvark is not closely related to the pig; rather, it is the sole extant representative of the obscure mammalian [[order (biology)|order]] [[Tubulidentata]],&lt;ref name=sho&gt;{{harvnb|Shoshani|2002|p=618}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus ''[[Orycteropus]]'', the sole surviving genus in the family [[Orycteropodidae]]. The aardvark is not closely related to the [[South America]]n [[anteater]], despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance.&lt;ref name=awf/&gt; The similarities are based on [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; The closest living relatives of the aardvark are the [[elephant shrew]]s, [[tenrecidae|tenrec]]s and [[golden mole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asher|Bennett|Lehmann|2009|p=854}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the [[sirenian]]s, [[hyrax]]es, [[elephant]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rodriguez|2013|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their extinct relatives, these animals form the superorder [[Afrotheria]].&lt;ref name=UR&gt;{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|pp=450–451}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of the brain have shown the similarities with [[Condylarthra]],&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; and given the clade's status as a [[wastebasket taxon]] it may mean some species traditionally classified as "condylarths" are actually stem-aardvarks.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=== Evolutionary history ===
Based on fossils, Bryan Patterson has concluded that early relatives of the aardvark appeared in [[Africa]] around the end of the [[Paleocene]].&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt;&lt;ref name=sho2&gt;{{harvnb|Shoshani|2002|p=620}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ptolemaiida]]ns, a mysterious clade of mammals with uncertain affinities, may actually be stem-aardvarks, either as a sister clade to [[Tubulidentata]] or as a grade leading to true tubulidentates.&lt;ref name="Cote et al 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cote S, Werdelin L, Seiffert ER, Barry JC |title=Additional material of the enigmatic Early Miocene mammal ''Kelba'' and its relationship to the order Ptolemaiida |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=104 |issue=13 |pages=5510–5 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17372202 |pmc=1838468 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0700441104 |bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.5510C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seifert2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seiffert|first=Erik R|title=A new estimate of afrotherian phylogeny based on simultaneous analysis of genomic, morphological, and fossil evidence|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|year=2007|volume=7|issue=1|pages=224|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-7-224|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/224|pmid=17999766|pmc=2248600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first unambiguous tubulidentate was probably ''[[Myorycteropus africanus]]'' from [[Kenya]]n [[Miocene]] deposits.&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; The earliest example from the genus ''[[Orycteropus]]'' was ''[[Orycteropus mauritanicus]]'', found in [[Algeria]] in deposits from the middle Miocene, with an equally old version found in Kenya.&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; Fossils from the aardvark have been dated to 5 million years, and have been located throughout [[Europe]] and the [[Near East]].&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt;

The mysterious Pleistocene ''[[Plesiorycteropus]]'' from [[Madagascar]] was originally thought to be a tubulidentate that was descended from ancestors that entered the island during the [[Eocene]]. However, a number of subtle anatomical differences coupled with recent molecular evidence now lead researchers to believe that ''Plesiorycteropus'' is a relative of golden moles and tenrecs that achieved an aardvark-like appearance and ecological niche through convergent evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, M. 2013. A molecular phylogeny of Plesiorycteropus reassigns the extinct mammalian order 'Bibymalagasia'. PLoS ONE 8(3):e59614.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Aardvark skeleton mount.JPG|thumb|right|An aardvark skeleton and mounted individual]]
The aardvark is vaguely pig-like in appearance. Its body is stout with a prominently arched back&lt;ref name=UR1&gt;{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|p=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs. The limbs are of moderate length, with the rear legs being longer than the forelegs.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; The front feet have lost the pollex (or 'thumb'), resulting in four toes, while the rear feet have all five toes. Each toe bears a large, robust [[Nail (anatomy)|nail]] which is somewhat flattened and shovel-like, and appears to be intermediate between a [[claw]] and a hoof. Whereas the aardvark is considered [[digitigrade]], it appears at time to be [[plantigrade]]. This confusion happens because when it squats it stands on its soles.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; A contributing characteristic to the burrow digging capabilities of aardvarks is an endosteal tissue called compacted coarse cancellous bone (CCCB). The stress and strain resistance provided by CCCB allows aardvarks to create their burrows, ultimately leading to a favorable environment for plants and a variety of animals. &lt;ref&gt;Botha-Brink, J., &amp; Legendre, J. L. (2018). Digging the compromise: investigating the link 
between limb and bone histology and fossoriality in the aardvark (Orycteropus afer). PeerJ, 6, 1-40.

An aardvark's weight is typically between {{convert|60|and(-)|80|kg}}.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; An aardvark's length is usually between {{convert|105|and(-)|130|cm|ft}},&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; and can reach lengths of {{convert|2.2|m}} when its tail (which can be up to {{convert|70|cm}}) is taken into account. It is {{convert|60|cm|in}} tall at the shoulder, and has a girth of about {{convert|100|cm|ft}}.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; It is the [[Largest organisms|largest]] member of the proposed clade [[Afroinsectiphilia]]. The aardvark is pale yellowish-gray in color and often stained reddish-brown by [[soil]]. The aardvark's coat is thin, and the animal's primary protection is its tough skin. Its hair is short on its head and tail; however its legs tend to have longer hair.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; The hair on the majority of its body is grouped in clusters of 3-4 hairs.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; The hair surrounding its nostrils is dense to help filter particulate matter out as it digs. Its tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers.

===Head===
The greatly elongated head is set on a short, thick neck, and the end of the snout bears a disc, which houses the nostrils. It contains a thin but complete [[zygomatic arch]].&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; The head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features. One of the most distinctive characteristics of the Tubulidentata is their [[Tooth|teeth]]. Instead of having a [[pulp (tooth)|pulp cavity]], each tooth has a cluster of thin, hexagonal, upright, parallel tubes of vasodentin (a modified form of [[dentine]]), with individual pulp canals, held together by [[cementum]].&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; The number of columns is dependent on the size of the tooth, with the largest having about 1,500.&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; The teeth have no [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] coating and are worn away and regrow continuously.&lt;ref name=sho1/&gt; The aardvark is born with conventional incisors and [[canine tooth|canines]] at the front of the jaw, which fall out and are not replaced. Adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the [[jaw]], and have a [[dentition|dental formula]] of: {{DentalFormula|upper=0.0.2-3.3|lower=0.0.2.3}} These remaining teeth are peg-like and rootless and are of unique composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|1983|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teeth consist of 14 upper and 12 lower jaw molars.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; The nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area, as it contains ten [[nasal concha]]e, more than any other placental mammal.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt;

The sides of the nostrils are thick with hair.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; The tip of the snout is highly mobile and is moved by modified [[mimetic muscles]].&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; The fleshy dividing tissue between its nostrils probably has sensory functions,&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; but it is uncertain whether they are olfactory or vibratory in nature.&lt;ref name=UR6&gt;{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|p=458}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its nose is made up of more [[turbinate]] bones than any other mammal, with between 9 and 11, compared to dogs with 4 to 5.&lt;ref name=sho1/&gt; With a large quantity of turbinate bones, the aardvark has more space for the moist [[epithelium]], which is the location of the olfactory bulb.&lt;ref name=sho1/&gt; The nose contains nine [[olfactory bulb]]s, more than any other mammal.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; Its keen sense of smell is not just from the quantity of bulbs in the nose but also in the development of the brain, as its [[Olfactory bulb|olfactory lobe]] is very developed.&lt;ref name=UR2&gt;{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|pp=453–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; The snout resembles an elongated pig snout. The mouth is small and tubular, typical of species that feed on [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s. The aardvark has a long, thin, snakelike, protruding tongue (as much as {{convert|30|cm|in}} long)&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; and elaborate structures supporting a keen [[olfaction|sense of smell]].&lt;ref name="TaylorSkinner"&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|Skinner|2004|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ears, which are very effective,&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; are disproportionately long, about {{convert|20|-|25|cm|in}} long.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; The eyes are small for its head, and consist only of [[rod cell|rods]].&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt;

===Digestive system===
The aardvark's stomach has a muscular [[pyloric]] area that acts as a [[gizzard]] to grind swallowed food up, thereby rendering chewing unnecessary.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; Its [[cecum]] is large.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; Both sexes emit a strong smelling secretion from an anal gland.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; Its [[salivary gland]]s are highly developed and almost completely ring the neck;&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; their output is what causes the tongue to maintain its tackiness.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; The female has two pairs of [[teat]]s in the inguinal region.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt;

[[Gene]]tically speaking, the aardvark is a [[living fossil]], as its [[chromosome]]s are highly conserved, reflecting much of the early [[eutherian]] arrangement before the divergence of the major modern [[taxon|taxa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat and range==
Aardvarks are found in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], where suitable [[habitat]] ([[savanna]]s, [[grassland]]s, [[woodland]]s and [[bushland]]) and food (i.e., [[ants]] and [[termites]]) is available.&lt;ref name="awf"&gt;{{harvnb|African Wildlife Foundation|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They spend the daylight hours in dark underground burrows to avoid the heat of the day.&lt;ref name=ez&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only major habitat that they are not present in is swamp forest, as the high water table precludes digging to a sufficient depth.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt; They also avoid terrain rocky enough to cause problems with digging.&lt;ref name=UR3&gt;{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|p=455}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been documented as high as {{convert|3200|m|ft}} in Ethiopia. They are present throughout sub-Saharan Africa all the way to South Africa with few exceptions. These exceptions include the coastal areas of [[Namibia]], [[Ivory Coast]], and [[Ghana]]. They are not found in Madagascar.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;

==Ecology and behavior==
[[File:Orycteropus afer.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Aardvark resting]]
[[File:Erdvarkgat, Dingaanstat.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to a burrow]]
[[File:SanWild17.jpg|thumb|right|Emerging from a burrow]]
Aardvarks live for up to 23&amp;nbsp;years in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]].&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; Its keen hearing warns it of predators: [[lion]]s, [[leopard]]s, cheetahs, [[African wild dog|hunting dog]]s, [[hyena]]s, and [[pythonidae|pythons]].&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt;&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; Some humans also hunt aardvarks for meat.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; Aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies, but if all else fails, they will strike with their claws, tail and shoulders, sometimes flipping onto their backs lying motionless except to lash out with all four feet.&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; They are capable of causing substantial damage to unprotected areas of an attacker.&lt;ref name=sho1/&gt; They will also dig to escape as they can, when pressed, dig extremely quickly.&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; 

===Feeding===
The aardvark is [[nocturnal]] and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s ([[myrmecophagy]]);&lt;ref name="EoM"&gt;{{harvnb|van Aarde|1984|pp=466–467}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the [[aardvark cucumber]].&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; In fact, the cucumber and the aardvark have a symbiotic relationship as they eat the subterranean fruit, then defecate the seeds near their burrows, which then grow rapidly due to the loose soil and fertile nature of the area. The time spent in the intestine of the aardvark helps the fertility of the seed, and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark.&lt;ref name=sho1/&gt;&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; They avoid eating the African [[driver ant]] and red ants.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt; Due to their stringent diet requirements, they require a large range to survive.&lt;ref name=UR3/&gt; An aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset, and forages over a considerable home range encompassing {{convert|10|to|30|km|mi}}. While foraging for food, the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward, which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food. They zig-zag as they forage and will usually not repeat a route for 5–8 days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it again.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt;

During a foraging period, they will stop and dig a "V" shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as a means to explore their location.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; When a concentration of ants or termites is detected, the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of [[insect]]s with its long, sticky tongue—as many as 50,000 in one night have been recorded. Its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly. It avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostrils.&lt;ref name=ez/&gt; When successful, the aardvark's long (up to {{convert|30|cm|in}})&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; tongue licks up the insects; the termites' biting, or the ants' stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin. After an aardvark visit at a termite mound, other animals will visit to pick up all the leftovers.&lt;ref name=UR5&gt;{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Termite mounds alone don't provide enough food for the aardvark, so they look for termites that are on the move. When these insects move, they can form columns {{convert|10|-|40|m|ft}} long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark. These columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals.&lt;ref name=UR5/&gt; The trampled grass and dung attract termites from [[Odontotermes]], [[Microtermes]], and [[Pseudacanthotermes]] genera.&lt;ref name=UR5/&gt;

On a nightly basis they tend to be more active during the first portion of the night time (20:00-00:00); however, they don't seem to prefer bright or dark nights over the other. During adverse weather or if disturbed they will retreat to their burrow systems. They cover between {{convert|2|and|5|km|mi}} per night; however, some studies have shown that they may traverse as far as {{convert|30|km|mi}} in a night.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt;

===Vocalization===
The aardvark is a rather quiet animal. However, it does make soft grunting sounds as it forages and loud grunts as it makes for its tunnel entrance.&lt;ref name=UR3/&gt; It makes a bleating sound if frightened.&lt;ref name=UR4&gt;{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it is threatened it will make for one of its burrows. If one is not close it will dig a new one rapidly. This new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt;

===Movement===
The aardvark is known to be a good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt; It can dig a yard of tunnel in about five minutes,&lt;ref name=UR3/&gt; but otherwise moves fairly slowly.

When leaving the burrow at night, they pause at the entrance for about ten minutes, sniffing and listening. After this period of watchfulness, it will bound out and within seconds it will be {{convert|10|m|ft}} away. It will then pause, prick its ears, twisting its head to listen, then jump and move off to start foraging.&lt;ref name=UR3/&gt;

Aside from digging out ants and termites, the aardvark also [[fossorial|excavates]] burrows in which to live; of which they generally fall into three categories: burrows made while foraging, refuge and resting location, and permanent homes.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; Temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are used as refuges, while the main [[burrow]] is also used for breeding. Main burrows can be deep and extensive, have several entrances and can be as long as {{convert|13|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; These burrows can be large enough for a man to enter.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; The aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly, and periodically moves on and makes a new one. The old burrows are an important part of the African wildlife scene. As they are vacated, then they are inhabited by smaller animals like the [[African Wild Dog|African wild dog]], [[ant-eating chat]], ''[[Nycteris thebaica]]'' and [[warthog]]s.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt; Other animals that use them are hares, mongooses, hyenas, owls, pythons, and lizards. Without these refuges many animals would die during wildfire season.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt; Only mothers and young share burrows; however, the aardvark is known to live in small family groups or as a solitary creature.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; If attacked in the tunnel, it will escape by digging out of the tunnel thereby placing the fresh fill between it and its predator, or if it decides to fight it will roll onto its back, and attack with its claws.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; The aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated [[ant]] nest, which also serves as protection from its [[predator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[File:Aardvarks.jpg|thumb|right|Aardvark mother and young]]
Aardvarks pair only during the breeding season; after a [[gestation]] period of seven months,&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; one cub weighing around {{convert|1.7|-|1.9|kg|lb}}&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; is born during May–July.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; When born, the young has flaccid ears and many wrinkles. When nursing, it will nurse off each teat in succession.&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; After two weeks, the folds of skin disappear and after three, the ears can be held upright.&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; After 5–6 weeks, body hair starts growing.&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; It is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks and eats termites at 9&amp;nbsp;weeks,&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; and is weaned between three months&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; and 16&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; At six months of age, it is able to dig its own burrows, but it will often remain with the mother until the next [[mating season]],&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; and is sexually mature from approximately two years of age.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt;

==Conservation==
Aardvarks were thought to have declining numbers,&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; however, this is possibly due to the fact that they are not readily seen.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt; There are no definitive counts because of their nocturnal and secretive habits; however, their numbers seem to be stable overall. They are not considered common anywhere in Africa, but due to their large range, they maintain sufficient numbers. There may be a slight decrease in numbers in eastern, northern, and western Africa. Southern African numbers are not decreasing. It receives an official designation from the IUCN as [[least concern]].&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt; However, they are a species in a precarious situation, as they are so dependent on such specific food; therefore if a problem arises with the abundance of termites, the species as a whole would be affected drastically.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt;

Aardvarks handle captivity well. The first zoo to have one was [[London Zoo]] in 1869, which had an animal from [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt;

==Mythology and popular culture==
[[File:F-14A Tomcat of VF-114 in flight 1977.jpg|thumb|200px|F-14 Tomcat from VF-114 Aardvarks with the squadron mascot painted on the tail]]

In [[African folklore]], the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to [[army ant|soldier ants]]. [[Hausa people|Hausa]] magicians make a charm from the heart, skin, forehead, and nails of the aardvark, which they then proceed to pound together with the root of a certain tree. Wrapped in a piece of skin and worn on the chest, the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night. The charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents' permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rebecca|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some tribes, such as the [[Mangbetu people|Margbetu]], [[Ayanda]], and [[Logo people|Logo]],&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; will use aardvark teeth to make bracelets, which are regarded as good luck charms.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; The meat, which has a resemblance to pork, is eaten in certain cultures.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt;

The [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian god]] [[Set (mythology)|Set]] is usually depicted with the head of an [[Set animal|unidentified animal]], whose similarity to an aardvark has been noted in scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|te Velde|1997|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arthur Read|titular character]] of ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'', an animated television series for children based on a book series and produced by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]], shown in more than 180 countries, is an aardvark.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|WGBH|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otis the Aardvark]] was a puppet character used on [[Children's BBC]] programming.

An aardvark features as the antagonist in the cartoon ''[[The Ant and the Aardvark]]'' as well as in the Canadian animated series ''[[The Raccoons]]''.

In the military, the Air Force supersonic fighter-bomber [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111/FB-111]] was nicknamed the Aardvark because of its long nose resembling the animal.  It also had similarities with its nocturnal missions flown at a very low level employing ordnance that could penetrate deep into the ground.  In the US Navy, the squadron [[VF-114]] was nicknamed the Aardvarks, flying [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]]s and then [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]]s.  The squadron mascot was adapted from the animal in the comic strip ''[[B.C. (comic strip)#Animals and other non-human characters|B.C.]]'', which the F-4 was said to resemble.

[[Cerebus the Aardvark]] is a 300-issue comic book series by Dave Sim.

'''Agresphon''' ([[ancient Greek|Gr.]] '''{{lang|grc|Ἀγρέσφων}}'''), or possibly '''Agreophon''', was an [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Philologist|grammarian]] mentioned in the ''[[Suda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Suda'', ''s.v.'' {{lang|grc|Ἀπολλώνιος}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote a work on persons with [[homonym]]ous names, sometimes called in English ''On Namesakes'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ Ὁμωνύμων}}).

Agresphon cannot have lived earlier than the reign of [[Hadrian]], as in his work he spoke of an [[Apollonius the Sophist|Apollonius]] who lived in the time of that emperor.&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Mason  | first = Charles Peter  | contribution = Agresphon  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 75  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0084.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars generally date him to the late 3rd or early 4th century.&lt;ref name="df"/&gt;

Agresphon's book on homonymous people was thought to have been similar to, or perhaps dependent upon, a work by [[Demetrius of Magnesia]], which bears the same title, and was written around the 1st century BC.&lt;ref name="df"/&gt;  There is some debate as to whether his name was properly "Agresphon" or "Agreophon".&lt;ref name="df"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Schepens  | first = G. | title = Die Fragmente Der Griechischen Historiker: Continued  | publisher = [[Brill Publishers]]  | year = 1998  | location = Leiden  | pages = 258–260  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wOTq8nXKIWoC| isbn = 90-04-11304-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, unrelated Agreophon who was father of [[Zeno of Caunus|Zenon]] around the 3rd century BC is mentioned frequently in the [[papyrus|papyri]] of the [[Zenon Archive]].

'''Artur (Conrad) Kozłowski''' (17 October 1977 – 5 September 2011) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[cave diving|cave diver]] who spent his last years in [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=RTE7Sept&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0907/galway.html | title=UK team asked to assist Galway cave recovery | publisher=[[RTÉ News]]| date=7 September 2011 | accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst other achievements in cave exploration, he holds the record for the deepest cave dive in [[British Isles|Great Britain and Ireland]] at a depth of {{convert|103|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=ak-darkrising2009 /&gt;

==Biography==
===Career===
Kozłowski came to Ireland from [[Poznań]], in Poland, in 2006 and worked as a quantity surveyor. His projects included the [[Aviva Stadium]] and Heuston Square developments in [[Dublin]]. He would later play an important role in compiling maps for [[Galway County Council]] and the [[National Roads Authority]] for the design and development of the [[N18 road (Ireland)|N18]] road (Now the [[M18 motorway (Ireland)|M18 motorway]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Siggins| first=Lorna| title=Subterranean Ireland: the last frontier| work=[[The Irish Times]]| date=10 September 2011| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/subterranean-ireland-the-last-frontier-1.596166| accessdate=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction to cave diving===
When he moved to Ireland, Kozłowski was a qualified [[Underwater diving|diver]], with 13 warm [[Open water diving|open water dives]] under his belt. Shortly after his arrival he became interested in underwater [[cave]] exploration, and began learning cave diving with the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] cave diving instructor [[Martyn Farr]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=SUI&gt;{{cite web| publisher=[[Speleological Union of Ireland]] |title=Artur Kozłowski, RIP| url=http://www.caving.ie/2011/09/artur-Kozlowski-rip/| date=7 September 2011| accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began diving in the Hell Complex, part of the Green Holes group of underwater [[sea cave]]s off [[Doolin]], [[County Clare]] and initially used the area as a training ground for his newly acquired skills.&lt;ref name=ak-doolin2009&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kozłowski| first=Artur| title=Siren Song: Doolin's Green Holes revisited| journal=Irish Speleology| publisher=[[Speleological Union of Ireland]]| volume=18| issn=0332-4907| year=2009| pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon began exploring and [[Cave survey|mapping]] undiscovered passage, and by July 2007 he had made his first significant breakthrough, making the first traverse between Hell's Kitchen and Robertson's Cave in the nearby Reef Complex.&lt;ref name=ak-doolin2009 /&gt;

===Exploration===
Kozłowski was responsible for many extensions to cave systems in both Ireland and [[Spain]], the most notable being the extension to the [[Marble Arch Caves]] system. In 2009 and 2010 diving connections were made to nearby cave systems by Kozłowski, firstly to Prod's Pot – Cascades Rising, doubling the total length of the system from 4.5 to {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Kozłowski| first=Artur| title=Report from connection between Marble Arch and Prod's Pot/Cascades systems| date=15 November 2009| work=Hell &amp; High Water| url=http://arturconrad.blogspot.com/2009/11/green-lake-marble-arch-prods.html| accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently to newly established Monastir Sink – Upper Cradle system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Kozłowski| first=Artur| title=Monastir Sink – Upper Cradle connection| date=11 April 2010| work=Hell &amp; High Water| url=http://arturconrad.blogspot.com/2010/05/im-very-pleased-to-announce-that.html| accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; extending the wider system further to {{convert|11.5|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Kozłowski| first=Artur| title=Report from connection between Marble Arch and Upper Cradle| date=21 May 2010| work=Hell &amp; High Water| url=http://arturconrad.blogspot.com/2010/05/cradle-holes-connected-making-second.html| accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discoveries make this the longest cave in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name=UKcaves&gt;{{cite web | work=UK Caves Database | title=N Ireland – Longest caves | url=http://www.ukcaves.co.uk/country-nireland-longest | accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He holds the record for the deepest cave dive in Great Britain and Ireland at a depth of {{convert|103|m|ft|abbr=on}} in [[Pollatoomary]], near [[Killavally, County Mayo|Killavally]], [[County Mayo]], Ireland.&lt;ref name=ak-darkrising2009 &gt;{{cite journal| last=Kozłowski| first=Artur| title=Dark Rising: the exploration of an underground river in County Mayo, Ireland| journal=Irish Speleology| publisher=[[Speleological Union of Ireland]]| volume=18| issn=0332-4907| year=2009| pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Gallagher| first=Emer| newspaper=[[Mayo News]]| title=Explorer plunges to new depths in Mayo| url=http://www.mayonews.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=4721| date=16 July 2008| accessdate=21 September 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207194609/http://www.mayonews.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=4721| archivedate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps his most notable achievement was the exploration of over {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} of underwater passage in the notoriously unforgiving cave passages of the [[Gort]] region, including the discovery and exploration of [[Pollindre]], 1&amp;nbsp;km in length and the third deepest [[Sump (cave)|sump]] in Great Britain and Ireland{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} at {{convert|82|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Kozłowski| first=Artur| title=New deep underwater cave discovered in Gort| date=17 December 2010| work=Hell &amp; High Water| url=http://arturconrad.blogspot.com/2010/12/new-deep-underwater-cave-discovered-in.html| accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011 Kozłowski received the Kolosy award for cave exploration at the annual Polish travelling and outdoor sports conference, held in [[Gdynia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kolosy.pl/nagrody/itemlist/category/53.html |title=Artur Kozłowski |accessdate=11 August 2013 |language=Polish |website=Kolosy.pl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516180828/http://kolosy.pl/nagrody/itemlist/category/53.html |archivedate=16 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and public speaking==
Kozłowski was a passionate advocate of exploration and diving; his blog&lt;ref name=Blog&gt;{{cite web|last=Kozłowski|first=Artur|title=Hell &amp; High Water|url=http://arturconrad.blogspot.com/|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; recounted in detail his underwater adventures. His latest discoveries filled the pages of the journal ''[[Irish Speleology]]'' and ''[[Descent (magazine)|Descent]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=SUI /&gt;

He was also an engaging public speaker; his January 2011 talk at [[National University of Ireland, Galway|NUIG]]/[[Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology|GMIT]] Sub Aqua Club was well received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=NUIG/GMIT Sub Aqua Club| title='Cave Diving in Ireland' by Artur Kozlowski| date=14 January 2011| url=http://vimeo.com/18925954| accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Kozłowski died during a cave dive in the Gort lowlands on 5 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top cave diver perishes |url=http://www.divernet.com/home_diving_news/1045881/top_caver_diver_perishes.html |work=Diver Magazine |date=7 September 2011 |accessdate=10 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327071040/http://www.divernet.com/home_diving_news/1045881/top_caver_diver_perishes.html |archivedate=27 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was successfully recovered on 10 September 2011 after an extensive recovery effort. The cave in which he died is called [[Pollonora 10]] in the townland of [[Kiltartan]], Gort, County Galway, Ireland, and his body was found at the known limits of the cave, at a depth of {{convert|−52|m|ft|abbr=on}} and approximately {{convert|810|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the entrance.&lt;ref name=RTE7Sept /&gt;

On 15 September, Kozłowski was buried in the nearby cemetery after a service at St Attracta's church, attended by [[gardaí]], divers and members of the [[Irish Cave Rescue Organisation]], friends, family and members of the local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Fallon| first=John| title=Tributes paid at funeral of Polish cave diver| date=16 September 2011| website=irishtimes.com| url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/tributes-paid-at-funeral-of-polish-cave-diver-1.600729| accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0915/306207-galway/| title=Funeral of Polish diver takes place in Galway| date=15 September 2013| accessdate=11 August 2013| website=rte.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, in recognition of his contribution to Irish [[speleology]], the [[Speleological Union of Ireland]] set up the Kozłowski Fund to support original cave exploration in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Kozłowski Fund| work=caving.ie| publisher=SUICRO| url=http://www.caving.ie/expeditions/kozlowski-fund/| accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a fundraising page was set up in order to pay for a headstone for Kozłowski 's grave in Kiltartan, and for a plaque to be erected at the entrance to Pollonora 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Fundraiser by Małgosia Ignasiak: Memoartur.blogspot.com| website=gofundme.com| url=https://uk.gofundme.com/memoartur| accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaque and headstone were engraved by a [[Gort]]-based stonemason and on 6 September 2014, marking the third anniversary of Kozłowski's death, the gravestone and plaque were unveiled to a gathering of friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=MemoArturProject| url=http://memoartur.blogspot.com/| accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francesco Redi.jpg|right|thumb|[[Francesco Redi]], the founder of biology, is recognized to be one of the greatest biologists of all time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hydatidosis of the Central Nervous System: Diagnosis and Treatment|author=Mehmet and Turgut |year=2014 |publisher=Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-54359-3|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''biologist''' is a [[scientist]] who has specialized knowledge in the field of [[biology]], the scientific study of [[life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/biology|title=the definition of biology|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists involved in fundamental research attempt to explore and further explain the underlying mechanisms that govern the functioning of living matter. Biologists involved in applied research attempt to develop or improve more specific processes and understanding, in fields such as [[medicine]] and [[industry]].

Biologists are interested in understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern the functioning of living matter as well as the complex properties that emerge from the biophysical, biochemical, cellular and systemic interactions of [[Organism|living systems]]. Biologists conduct research using the [[scientific method]] to test the validity of a theory in a rational, unbiased and reproducible manner. This consists of [[hypothesis]] formation, [[experiment]]ation and [[data analysis]] to establish the validity or invalidity of a scientific theory.

There are different types of biologists. [[Theoretical Biology|Theoretical biologists]] use mathematical methods and develop [[Mathematical model|models]] to understand  phenomena and ideally predict future experimental results, while [[Experimental biology|experimental biologists]] conceive experiments to test those predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-12-07|title=On the origin of non-membrane-bound organelles, and their physiological function|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519317301546|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|language=en|volume=434|pages=42–49|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.04.006|issn=0022-5193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Biology, Principles of Genome Function|last=Craig|first=Nancy|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=9780199658572|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some biologists work on [[Microorganism|microorganisms]], while others study [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]] organisms (including [[Homo sapiens|humans]]). Some investigate the nano or micro-scale, others emergent properties such as [[Ecology|ecological interactions]] or [[Neuroscience|cognition]]. There is much overlap between different fields of biology (e.g. [[zoology]], [[microbiology]], [[genetics]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) and due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field it is often difficult to classify a life scientist as only one of them. Many biological scientists work in research and development. Some conduct fundamental research to advance human knowledge of life. Furthermore, applied biological research often aids the development of solutions to problems in areas such as human health and the natural environment. Biological scientists mostly work in government, university, and private industry [[Laboratory|laboratories]]. 

==Research==
[[File:Mwb in lab-2.jpg|thumb|[[Martinus Willem Beijerinck]], a botanist and microbiologist]]
Biologists who work in basic research formulates theories and devise experiments to advance human knowledge on life including topics such as [[evolution]], [[biochemistry]], [[Molecular biology|molecular biology,]] [[neuroscience]] and [[cell biology]].

Biological scientists who work in applied research use instead the accomplishments gained by basic research to further knowledge in particular fields or applications. For example, this applied research may be used to develop new [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, treatments and medical [[diagnostic test]]s. Biological scientists conducting applied research and product development in private industry may be required to describe their research plans or results to non-scientists who are in a position to veto or approve their ideas. These scientists must consider the business effects of their work.

While theoretical biologists usually works in "dry" labs, formulating mathematical models and running computer simulations, some experimental biologists conduct laboratory experiments involving [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Microorganism|microorganisms]] or [[Biomolecule|biomolecules]]. However, a small part of experimental biological research also occurs outside the laboratory and may involve natural observation rather than experimentation. For example, a botanist may investigate the plant species present in a particular environment, while an ecologist might study how a forest area recovers after a fire.

Swift advances in knowledge of genetics and organic molecules spurred growth in the field of biotechnology, transforming the industries in which biological scientists work. Biological scientists can now manipulate the genetic material of animals and plants, attempting to make organisms (including humans) more productive or resistant to disease. Basic and applied research on biotechnological processes, such as recombining DNA, has led to the production of important substances, including human insulin and growth hormone. Many other substances not previously available in large quantities are now produced by biotechnological means. Some of these substances are useful in treating diseases.

Those working on various genome (chromosomes with their associated genes) projects isolate genes and determine their function. This work continues to lead to the discovery of genes associated with specific diseases and inherited health risks, such as sickle cell anemia. Advances in biotechnology have created research opportunities in almost all areas of biology, with commercial applications in areas such as medicine, agriculture, and [[environmental remediation]].

==Specialists==
Most biological scientists specialize in the study of a certain type of organism or in a specific activity, although recent advances have blurred some traditional classifications.{{why|provide explanation of this and sources|date=October 2013}}
* [[Geneticist]]s study [[genetics]], the science of [[genes]], [[heredity]], and [[Genetic variation|variation]] of [[organism]]s.
* [[Neuroscientist]]s study the [[nervous system]].
* [[Developmental biology|Developmental biologists]] study the process of development and growth of [[organism]]s
* [[Biochemistry|Biochemists]] study the chemical composition of living things. They analyze the complex chemical combinations and reactions involved in [[metabolism]], [[reproduction]], and growth.
* [[Molecular biology|Molecular biologists]] study the [[Biology|biological]] activity between [[biomolecule]]s.
* [[Microbiology|Microbiologists]] investigate the growth and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as [[bacteria]], [[algae]], or [[Fungus|fungi]].
* [[Physiology|Physiologists]] study life functions of plants and animals,  in the whole organism and at the cellular or molecular level, under normal and abnormal conditions. Physiologists often specialize in functions such as growth, reproduction, [[photosynthesis]], respiration, or movement, or in the physiology of a certain area or system of the organism.
* [[Biophysics|Biophysicists]] use experimental methods traditionally employed in [[physics]] to answer biological questions .
* [[Computational Biology|Computational Biologists]] apply the techniques of [[computer science]], [[applied mathematics]] and [[statistics]] to address biological problems. The main focus lies on developing [[mathematical modeling]] and computational simulation techniques. By these means it addresses scientific research topics with their theoretical and experimental questions without a laboratory.
* [[Zoology|Zoologists]] and wildlife biologists study animals and wildlife—their origin, behavior, diseases, and life processes. Some experiment with live animals in controlled or natural surroundings, while others dissect dead animals to study their structure. Zoologists and wildlife biologists also may collect and analyze biological data to determine the environmental effects of current and potential uses of land and water areas. Zoologists usually are identified by the animal group they study. For example, [[ornithology|ornithologists]] study [[bird]]s, [[mammalogy|mammalogists]] study [[mammal]]s, [[herpetology|herpetologists]] study [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s, [[ichthyology|ichthyologists]] study [[fish]], [[cnidariologist]]s study [[jellyfish]]es and [[entomologist]]s study insects.
* [[Botany|Botanists]] study plants and their environments. Some study all aspects of plant life, including [[algae]], [[lichen]]s, [[moss]]es, [[fern]]s, [[Pinophyta|conifers]], and [[flowering plant]]s; others specialize in areas such as identification and classification of plants, the structure and function of plant parts, the biochemistry of plant processes, the causes and cures of plant diseases, the interaction of plants with other organisms and the environment, the geological record of plants and their evolution.  [[Mycology|Mycologists]] study [[fungi]], such as [[yeasts]], [[mold]] and [[mushrooms]], which are a separate kingdom from plants.
* Aquatic biologists study micro-organisms, plants, and animals living in water. [[Marine Biology|Marine biologists]] study salt water organisms, and limnologists study [[Limnology|fresh water organisms]]. Much of the work of marine biology centers on [[molecular biology]], the study of the biochemical processes that take place inside living cells. Marine biology is a branch of [[oceanography]], which is the study of the biological, chemical, geological, and physical characteristics of oceans and the ocean floor. (See the Handbook statements on environmental scientists and hydrologists and on geoscientists.)
* [[Ecology|Ecologists]] investigate the relationships among organisms and between organisms and their environments, examining the effects of population size, pollutants, rainfall, temperature, and altitude. Using knowledge of various scientific disciplines, ecologists may collect, study, and report data on the quality of air, food, soil, and water.
* [[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologists]] investigate the [[evolution|evolutionary processes]] that produced the [[Biodiversity|diversity of life]] on [[Earth]], starting from [[Last universal common ancestor|a single common ancestor]]. These processes include [[natural selection]], [[common descent]], and [[speciation]].

==Working conditions==
Biological scientists are not usually exposed to unsafe or unhealthy conditions. Those who work with dangerous organisms or [[Toxicity|toxic]] substances in the laboratory must follow strict [[safety]] procedures to avoid [[contamination]]. Many biological scientists, such as botanists, ecologists, and zoologists, conduct field studies that involve strenuous physical activity and primitive living conditions. Biological scientists in the field may work in warm or cold climates, in all kinds of [[weather]].

Marine biologists encounter a variety of working conditions. Some work in laboratories; others work on research ships, and those who work underwater must practice safe diving while working around sharp [[coral reef]]s and hazardous marine life. Although some marine biologists obtain their specimens from the sea, many still spend a good deal of their time in laboratories and offices, conducting tests, running experiments, recording results, and compiling data.

Many biological scientists depend on [[Grant (money)|grant money]] to fund their research. They may be under pressure to meet deadlines and to conform to rigid grant-writing specifications when preparing proposals to seek new or extended funding.

Biological scientists typically work regular hours. While the 40-hour workweek is common, longer hours are not uncommon. Researchers may be required to work odd hours in laboratories or other locations (especially while in the field), depending on the nature of their research.

==Honors and awards==
The highest honor awarded to biologists is the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], awarded since 1901, by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Another significant award is the [[Crafoord Prize]] in Biosciences; established in 1980.

The research was published in March 2011 in the [[fringe science|fringe]] ''[[Journal of Cosmology]]'' by [[Richard B. Hoover]], an engineer. However, NASA distanced itself from Hoover's claim and his lack of expert peer-reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kerry | last = Sheridan | title = NASA shoots down alien fossil claims | date = 7 March 2011 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/03/08/3157645.htm | work = ABC News | accessdate = 2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
{{Main|Journal of Cosmology#Hoover paper controversy}}
Hoover's team used Environmental ([[ESEM]]) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy ([[FESEM]]) to analyze the meteorite samples, studying internal surfaces. Hoover also produced  electron micrographs which he believes resemble the shape of [[trichomic]] [[cyanobacteria]] and other trichomic [[prokaryotes]] such as the [[filamentous sulfur bacteria]]. For comparison, Hoover compared the samples to those of terrestrial minerals and biological materials. Hoover concludes from these results that the CI1 fossils are indigenous to the samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journalofcosmology.com/Life100.html | journal=[[Journal of Cosmology]] | year= 2011 | volume=  13 | title=Fossils of Cyanobacteria in CI1 Carbonaceous Meteorites:  Implications to Life on Comets, Europa, and Enceladus | first=Richard B. |last=Hoover| accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claims were initially submitted to the ''[[International Journal of Astrobiology]]'', which rejected the paper,&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt; but were eventually published by the [[fringe science|fringe]] ''[[Journal of Cosmology]]''. NASA distanced itself from Hoover's claims,&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;

In [[computer science]] and [[machine learning]], '''cellular neural networks (CNN)''' (or '''cellular nonlinear networks (CNN)''') are a [[parallel computing]] paradigm similar to [[neural networks]], with the difference that communication is allowed between neighbouring units only. Typical applications include [[image processing]], analyzing 3D surfaces, solving [[partial differential equation]]s, reducing non-visual problems to geometric maps, modelling biological [[visual system|vision]] and other [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensory-motor]] organs.

==CNN architecture==
Due to their number and variety of architectures, it is difficult to give a precise definition for a CNN processor.  From an architecture standpoint, CNN processors are a system of finite, fixed-number, fixed-location, fixed-topology, locally interconnected, multiple-input, single-output, nonlinear processing units.  The nonlinear processing units are often referred to as [[neurons]] or [[cells]].  Mathematically, each cell can be modeled as a dissipative, nonlinear [[dynamical system]] where information is encoded via its initial state, inputs and variables used to define its behavior.  Dynamics are usually continuous, as in the case of [[Discrete time and continuous time|Continuous-Time]] CNN (CT-CNN) processors, but can be discrete, as in the case of [[Discrete time and continuous time|Discrete-Time]] CNN (DT-CNN) processors.  Each cell has one output, by which it communicates its state with both other cells and external devices.  Output is typically [[Real number|real-valued]], but can be [[Complex number|complex]] or even [[quaternion]], i.e. a Multi-Valued CNN (MV-CNN).  In most CNN processors, processing units are identical, but there are applications that require non-identical units, which are called Non-Uniform Processor CNN (NUP-CNN) processors, and consist of different types of cells.  In the original Chua-Yang CNN (CY-CNN) processor, the state of the cell was a weighted sum of the inputs and the output was a [[piecewise linear function]].  However, like the original [[perceptron]]-based neural networks, the functions it could perform were limited: specifically, it was incapable of modeling non-linear functions, such as [[XOR]].  More complex functions are realizable via Non-Linear CNN (NL-CNN) processors.

Cells are defined in a normed space, commonly a two-dimensional [[Euclidean geometry]], like a grid.  The cells are not limited to two-dimensional spaces however; they can be defined in an arbitrary number of dimensions and can be square, triangle, hexagonal, or any other spatially invariant arrangement. Topologically, cells can be arranged on an infinite plane or on a [[Torus|toroidal]] space. Cell interconnect is local, meaning that all connections between cells are within a specified radius (with distance measured topologically). Connections can also be time-delayed to allow for processing in the temporal domain.

Most CNN architectures have cells with the same relative interconnects, but there are applications that require a spatially variant topology, i.e. Multiple-Neighborhood-Size CNN (MNS-CNN) processors.  Also, Multiple-Layer CNN (ML-CNN) processors, where all cells on the same layer are identical, can be used to extend the capability of CNN processors.

The definition of a system is a collection of independent, interacting entities forming an integrated whole, whose behavior is distinct and qualitatively greater than its entities.  Although connections are local, information exchange can happen globally through diffusion.  In this sense, CNN processors are systems because their dynamics are derived from the interaction between the processing units and not within processing units. As a result, they exhibit emergent and collective behavior.  Mathematically, the relationship between a cell and its neighbors, located within an area of influence, can be defined by a coupling law, and this is what primarily determines the behavior of the processor. When the coupling laws are modeled by [[fuzzy logic]], it is a fuzzy CNN

==Literature review==
The idea of CNN processors was introduced by [[Leon Chua]] and Lin Yang’s two-part, 1988 article, "Cellular Neural Networks: Theory" and "Cellular Neural Networks: Applications" in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems.  In these articles, Chua and Yang outline the underlying mathematics behind CNN processors.  They use this mathematical model to demonstrate, for a specific CNN implementation, that if the inputs are static, the processing units will converge, and can be used to perform useful calculations.  They then suggest one of the first applications of CNN processors: image processing and pattern recognition (which is still the largest application to date).  Leon Chua is still active in CNN research and publishes many of his articles in the [[International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos]], of which he is an editor.  Both IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems and the International Journal of Bifurcation also contain a variety of useful articles on CNN processors authored by other knowledgeable researchers.  The former tends to focus on new CNN architectures and the latter more on the dynamical aspects of CNN processors.

Another key article, Tamas Roska and Leon Chua’s 1993 article "The CNN Universal Machine: An Analogic Array Computer", introduced the first algorithmically programmable analog CNN processor to the engineering research community.  The multi-national effort was funded by the Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation, and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and researched by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the University of California.  This article proved that CNN processors were producible and provided researchers a physical platform to test their CNN theories.  After this article, companies started to invest into larger, more capable processors, based on the same basic architecture as the CNN Universal Processor.  Tamas Roska is another key contributor to CNNs. His name is often associated with biologically inspired information processing platforms and algorithms, and he has published numerous key articles and has been involved with companies and research institutions developing CNN technology.

There are several overviews of CNN processors in published literature.  One of the better references is a paper, "Cellular Neural Networks: A Review" written for Neural Nets WIRN Vietri 1993, by Valerio Cimagalli and Marco Balsi.  The paper provides definitions, CNN types, dynamics, implementations, and applications in a relatively small, readable document.  There is also a book, "Cellular Neural Networks and Visual Computing Foundations and Applications", written by Leon Chua and Tamas Roska, which provides examples and exercises to help illustrates points in a manner uncommon for papers and journal articles.  The book covers many different aspects of CNN processors and can serve as a textbook for a Masters or Ph.D. course.  The two references are considered invaluable since they manage to organize the vast amount of CNN literature into a coherent framework.

The best place for CNN literature is from the proceedings of "The International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their Applications".  The proceedings are available online, via IEEE Xplore, for conferences held in 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2005 and 2006.  There is also a workshop being held on July 14–16 in Santiago de Composetela, Spain.  Topics include theory, design, applications, algorithms, physical implementations and programming/training methods.  For an understanding of the analog semiconductor based CNN technology, AnaLogic Computers has their product line, in addition to the published articles available on their homepage and their publication list.  They also have information on other CNN technologies such as optical computing. Many of the commonly used functions have already been implemented using CNN processors.  A good reference point for some of these can be found in image processing libraries for CNN based visual computers such as Analogic’s CNN-based systems.

==Related processing architectures==
CNN processors could be thought of as a hybrid between [[Artificial neural network|ANN]] and CA (Continuous Automata).  The processing units of CNN and NN are similar.  In both cases, the processor units are multi-input, dynamical systems, and the behavior of the overall systems is driven primarily through the weights of the processing unit’s linear interconnect.  The main discriminator is that in CNN processors, connections are made locally, whereas in ANN, connections are global.  For example, neurons in one layer are fully connected to another layer in a feed-forward NN and all the neurons are fully interconnected in [[Hopfield networks]]. In ANNs, the weights of interconnections contain information on the processing system’s previous state or feedback, but in CNN processors, the weights are used to determine the dynamics of the system.  Furthermore, due to the high interconnectivity of ANNs, they tend not exploit locality in either the data set or the processing and as a result, they usually are highly redundant systems that allow for robust, fault-tolerant behavior without catastrophic errors. A cross between an ANN and a CNN processor is a Ratio Memory CNN (RMCNN).  In RMCNN processors, the cell interconnect is local and topologically invariant, but the weights are used to store previous states and not to control dynamics. The weights of the cells are modified during some learning state creating long-term memory.

The topology and dynamics of CNN processors closely resembles that of CA. Like most CNN processors, CA consists of a fixed-number of identical processors that are spatially discrete and topologically uniform. The difference is that most CNN processors are continuous-valued whereas CA have discrete-values. Furthermore, the CNN processor's cell behavior is defined via some non-linear function whereas CA processor cells are defined by some state machine. However, there are some exceptions. Continuous Valued Cellular Automata or Continuous Automata are CA with continuous resolution. Depending on how a given Continuous Automata is specified, it can also be a CNN. There are also Continuous Spatial Automata, which consist of an infinite number of spatially continuous, continuous-valued automata. There is considerable work being performed in this field since continuous spaces are easier to mathematically model than discrete spaces, thus allowing a more quantitative approach as opposed to an empirical approach taken by some researchers of [[cellular automata]]. Continuous Spatial Automata processors can be physically realized though an unconventional information processing platform such as a [[chemical computer]]. Furthermore, it is conceivable that large CNN processors (in terms of the resolution of the input and output) can be modeled as a Continuous Spatial Automata.

==Model of computation==
The dynamical behaviors of CNN processors can be expressed mathematically as a series of ordinary differential equations, where each equation represents the state of an individual processing unit.  The behavior of the entire CNN processor is defined by its initial conditions, the inputs, the cell interconnect (topology and weights), and the cells themselves.  One possible use of CNN processors is to generate and respond to signals of specific dynamical properties.  For example, CNN processors have been used to generate multi-scroll chaos, synchronize with chaotic systems, and exhibit multi-level hysterisis.  CNN processors are designed specifically to solve local, low-level, processor intensive problems expressed as a function of space and time.  For example, CNN processors can be used to implement high-pass and low-pass filters and morphological operators.  They can also be used to approximate a wide range of Partial Differential Equations (PDE) such as heat dissipation and wave propagation.

CNN processors can be used as Reaction-Diffusion (RD) processors.  RD processors are spatially invariant, topologically invariant, analog, parallel processors characterized by reactions, where two agents can combine to create a third agent, and diffusions, the spreading of agents.  RD processors are typically implemented through chemicals in a Petri dish (processor), light (input), and a camera (output) however RD processors can also be implemented through a multilayer CNN processor.  RD processors can be used to create Voronoi diagrams and perform skeletonisation.  The main difference between the chemical implementation and the CNN implementation is that CNN implementations are considerably faster than their chemical counterparts and chemical processors are spatially continuous whereas the CNN processors are spatially discrete.  The most researched RD processor, Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) processors, has already been simulated using a four-layer CNN processors and has been implemented in a semiconductor.

Like CA, computations can be performed through the generation and propagation of signals that either grow or change over time.  Computations can occur within a signal or can occur through the interaction between signals.  One type of processing, which uses signals and is gaining momentum is wave processing, which involves the generation, expanding, and eventual collision of waves.  Wave processing can be used to measure distances and find optimal paths. Computations can also occur through particles, gliders, solutions, and filterons localized structures that maintain their shape and velocity.  Given how these structures interact/collide with each other and with static signals, they can be used to store information as states and implement different Boolean functions.  Computations can also occur between complex, potentially growing or evolving localized behavior through worms, ladders, and pixel-snakes.  In addition to storing states and performing Boolean functions, these structures can interact, create, and destroy static structures.

Although CNN processors are primarily intended for analog calculations, certain types of CNN processors can implement any Boolean function, allowing simulating CA.  Since some CA are [[Universal Turing machine]]s (UTM), capable of simulating any algorithm can be performed on processors based on the von Neumann architecture, that makes this type of CNN processors, universal CNN, a UTM.   One CNN architecture consists of an additional layer, similar to the ANN solution to the problem stated by [[Marvin Minsky]] years ago.  CNN processors have resulted in the simplest realization of Conway’s Game of Life and Wolfram’s Rule 110, the simplest known universal Turing Machine.  This unique, dynamical representation of an old systems, allows researchers to apply techniques and hardware developed for CNN to better understand important CA.  Furthermore, the continuous state space of CNN processors, with slight modifications that have no equivalent in Cellular Automata, creates emergent behavior never seen before.

Any information processing platform that allows the construction of arbitrary Boolean functions is called universal, and as result, this class CNN processors are commonly referred to as universal CNN processors.  The original CNN processors can only perform linearly separable Boolean functions.  This is essentially the same problem Marvin Minsky introduced with respect to the perceptions of the first neural networks   In either case, by translating functions from digital logic or look-up table domains into the CNN domain, some functions can be considerably simplified.  For example, the nine-bit, odd parity generation logic, which is typically implemented by eight nested exclusive-or gates, can also be represented by a sum function and four nested absolute value functions.  Not only is there a reduction in the function complexity, but the CNN implementation parameters can be represented in the continuous, real-number domain.

There are two methods by which to select a CNN processor along with a template or weights.  The first is by synthesis, which involves determine the coefficients offline.  This can be done by leveraging off previous work, i.e. libraries, papers, and articles, or by mathematically deriving co that best suits the problem. The other is through training the processor.  Researchers have used back-propagation and genetic algorithms to learn and perform functions.  Back-propagation algorithms tend to be faster, but genetic algorithms are useful because they provide a mechanism to find a solution in a discontinuous, noisy search space.

==Technology==
An information processing platform remains nothing more than an intellectual exercise unless it can be implemented in hardware and integrated into a system.  Although processors based on billiard balls can be interesting, unless their implementation provides advantages for a system, the only purpose they serve is as a teaching device.  CNN processors have been implemented using current technology and there are plans to implement CNN processors into future technologies.  They include the necessary interfaces for programming and interfacing, and have been implemented in a variety of systems.  What follows is a cursory examination of the different types of CNN processors available today, their advantages and disadvantages, and the future roadmap for CNN processors.

CNN processors have been implemented and are currently available as semiconductors and there are plans to migrate CNN processors to emerging technologies in the future.  Semiconductor-based CNN processors can be segmented into analog CNN processors, digital CNN processors, and CNN processors emulated using digital processors.  Analog CNN processors were the first to be developed. [[Analog computer]]s were fairly common during the 1950 and 1960s, but they gradually were replaced by digital computers the 1970s.  Analog processors were considerably faster in certain applications such as optimizing differential equations and modeling nonlinearities, but the reason why analog computing lost favor was the lack of precision and the difficulty to configure an analog computer to solve a complex equation. Analog CNN processors share some of the same advantages as their predecessors, specifically speed.  The first analog CNN processors were able to perform real-time ultra-high frame-rate (&gt;10,000 frame/s) processing unachievable by digital processors.  The analog implementation of CNN processors requires less area and consumes less power than their digital counterparts.  Although the accuracy of analog CNN processors does not compare to their digital counterparts, for many applications, noise and process variances are small enough not to perceptually affect the image quality.

The first [[algorithm]]ically programmable, analog CNN processor was created in 1993.  It was named the CNN Universal Processor because its internal controller allowed multiple templates to be performed on the same data set, thus simulating multiple layers and allowing for universal computation.   Included in the design was a single layer 8x8 CCN, interfaces, analog memory, switching logic, and software.  The processor was developed in order to determine CNN processor producibility and utility.  The CNN concept proved promising and by 2000, there were at least six organizations designing algorithmically programmable, analog CNN processors.  This is when AnaFocus, a mixed-signal semiconductor company that emerged from research at The University of Seville, introduced their ACE prototype CNN processor product line.  Their first ACE processor contained 20x20 B/W processor units; their next ACE processor provided 48x48 grayscale processor units, and their latest ACE processor contains 128x128 grayscale processor units.  Over time, not only did the number of processing elements increase, but their speed improved, the number of functions they can perform increased, and a seamless detector interface was integrated into the silicon (yielding considerably improved interface).  The ability to embed the detector interface into the CNN processor allows for real-time interaction between the sensing and processing.  AnaFocus has a multilayer CASE prototype CNN processors line.  The latest CASE processor is a three layer 32x32 CNN processor.  Their work in CNN processors is currently culminating in their soon-to-be-released, commercially available Eye-RIS product line that consists of all the processors, co-processors, software development kits, and support needed to program and integrate an analog processor into a system.

AnaFocus is working with AnaLogic Computers, to include their CNN processors into visual systems.  Founded in 2000, by many of the same researchers behind the first algorithmically programmable CNN Universal Processor, AnaLogic Computers mission is to commercialize high-speed, biologically inspired systems based on CNN processors.  In 2003, AnaLogic Computers developed a PCI-X visual processor board that included the ACE 4K processor, with a Texas Instrument DIP module and a high-speed frame-grabber.  This allowed CNN processing to be easily included in a desktop computer, considerably improving the usability and capability of CNN analog processors.  In 2006, AnaLogic Computers developed their Bi-I Ultra High Speed Smart Camera product line, which includes the ACE 4K processor in their high-end models.  The product that their development team is now pursuing is the Bionic Eyeglass.  The Bionic Eyeglass is a dual-camera, wearable platform, based on the Bi-I Ultra High Speed Smart Camera, designed to provide assistance to blind people.  Some of the functions that the Bionic Eyeglass system will perform is route number recognition and color processing.

Some researchers are developed their own custom analog CNN processors.  For example, an analog CNN processor was developed from a research team from University degli Studi di Catania, in order to generate gaits for a hexapod robot.  Researchers from National Chiao Tung University designed a RM-CNN processor to learn more about pattern learning &amp; recognition and researchers from the National Lien-Ho Institute of Technology developed a Min-Max CNN (MMCNN) processor to learn more about CNN dynamics.  Given the diversity of CNN processors and the momentum that CNN research has gained, it is plausible that such analog CNN development efforts will be fairly common in the near future.

Despite their speed and low power consumption, there are some significant drawbacks to analog CNN processors. First, analog CNN processors can potentially create erroneous results due to environment and process variation.  In most applications, these errors are not noticeable, but there are situations where minor deviations can result in catastrophic system failures.  For example, in chaotic communication, process variation will change the trajectory of a given system in phase space, resulting in a lost of synchronicity/stability.  Due to the severity of the problem, there is considerable research being performed to ameliorate the problem.  Some researchers are optimizing templates to accommodate greater variation.  Other researchers are improving the semiconductor process to more closely match theoretical CNN performance.  Other researchers are investigating different, potentially more robust CNN architectures.  Lastly, researchers are developing methods to tune templates to target a specific chip and operating conditions.  In other words, the templates are being optimized to match the information processing platform.  Not only does process variation limit what can be done with current analog CNN processors, it is also a barrier for creating more complex processing units.  Unless this process variation is resolved, ideas such as nested processing units, non-linear inputs, etc. cannot be implemented in a real-time analog CNN processor.  Also, the semiconductor "real estate" for processing units limits the size of CNN processors.  Currently the largest AnaVision CNN-based vision processor consists of a 4K detector, which is significantly less than the megapixel detectors found in affordable, consumer cameras.  Unfortunately, feature size reductions, as predicted by Moore’s Law, will only result in minor improvements.  For this reason, alternate technologies such as Resonant Tunneling Diodes and Neuron-Bipolar Junction Transistors are being explored.   Also, the architecture of CNN processors is being reevaluated.  For example, Star-CNN processors, where one analog multiplier is time-shared between multiple processor units, have been proposed and are expected to result in processor unit reduction size of eighty percent.

Although not nearly as fast and energy efficient, digital CNN processors do not share the problems of process variation and feature size of their analog counterparts.  This allows digital CNN processors to include nested processor units, non-linearities, etc.  In addition, digital CNN are more flexible, cost less and are easier to integrate.  The most common implementation of digital CNN processors uses an FPGA.  Eutecus, founded in 2002 and operating in Berkeley, provides intellectual property that can be synthesized into an Altera FPGA.  Their digital 320x280, FPGA-based CNN processors run at 30 frame/s and there are plans to make a fast digital ASIC.  Eustecus is a strategic partner of AnaLogic computers, and their FPGA designs can be found in several of AnaLogic’s products.  Eutecus is also developing software libraries to perform tasks including but not limited to video analytics for the video security market, feature classification, multi-target tracking, signal and image processing and flow processing.  Many of these routines are derived using CNN-like processing.  For those wanting to perform CNN simulations for prototyping, low-speed applications, or research, there are several options.  First, there are precise CNN emulation software packages like SCNN 2000.  If the speed is prohibitive, there are mathematical techniques, such as Jacobi’s Iterative Method or Forward-Backward Recursions that can be used to derive the steady state solution of a CNN processor.  Said techniques can be performed by any mathematics tool, e.g. Matlab.  Lastly, digital CNN processors can be emulated on highly parallel, application-specific processors, such as graphics processors.  Implementing neural networks using graphics processors is an area of exploration for the research community.

Researchers are also perusing alternate technologies for CNN processors.  Although current CNN processors circumvent some of the problems associated with their digital counterparts, they do share some of the same long-term problems common to all semiconductor-based processors.  These include, but are not limited to, speed, reliability, power-consumption, etc.  AnaLogic Computers, is developing optical CNN processors, which combine optics, lasers, and biological and holographic memories.  What initially was technology exploration resulted in a 500x500 CNN processor able to perform 300 giga-operations per second.  Another promising technology for CNN processors is nanotechnology.  One nanotechnology concept being investigated is using single electron tunneling junctions, which can be made into single-electron or high-current transistors, to create McCulloch-Pitts CNN processing units.  In summary, CNN processors have been implemented and provide value to their users.  They have been able to effectively leverage the advantages and address some of the disadvantages associated with their underling technology, i.e. semiconductors.  Researchers are also transitioning CNN processors into emerging technologies.  Therefore, if the CNN architecture is suited for a specific information processing system, there are processors available for purchase (as there will be for the foreseeable future).

==Applications==
The philosophy, interests, and methodologies of CNN researchers are varied.  Due to the potential of the CNN architecture, this platform has attracted people from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines.  Some are exploring practical implementations of CNN processors, others are using CNN processors to model physical phenomena, and there are even researchers exploring theoretical mathematical, computational, and philosophical ideas through CNN processors.  Some applications are engineering related, where some known, understood behavior of CNN processors is exploited to perform a specific task, and some are scientific, where CNN processors are used to explore new and different phenomenon.  CNN processors are versatile platforms that are being used for a variety of applications.

CNN processors were designed to perform image processing; specifically, the original application of CNN processors was to perform real-time ultra-high frame-rate (&gt;10,000 frame/s) processing unachievable by digital processors needed for applications like particle detection in jet engine fluids and spark-plug detection.  Currently, CNN processors can achieve up to 50,000 frames per second, and for certain applications such as missile tracking, flash detection, and spark-plug diagnostics these microprocessors have outperformed a conventional supercomputer.  CNN processors lend themselves to local, low-level, processor intensive operations and have been used in feature extraction, level and gain adjustments, color constancy detection, contrast enhancement, deconvolution, image compression, motion estimation, image encoding, image decoding, image segmentation, orientation preference maps, pattern learning/recognition, multi-target tracking, image stabilization, resolution enhancement, image deformations and mapping, image inpainting, optical flow, contouring, [[moving object detection]], axis of symmetry detection, and image fusion.

Due to their processing capabilities and flexibility, CNN processors have been used &amp; prototyped for novel field applications such as flame analysis for monitoring combustion at a waste incinerator, mine-detection using infrared imagery, calorimeter cluster peak for high energy physics, anomaly detection in potential field maps for geophysics, laser dot detection, metal inspection for detecting manufacturing defects, and seismic horizon picking.  They have also been used to perform biometric functions such as [[fingerprint recognition]], vein feature extraction, face tracking, and generating visual stimuli via emergent patterns to gauge perceptual resonances.  CNN processors have been used for medical and biological research in performing automated nucleated cell counting for detecting hyperplasia, segment images into anatomically and pathologically meaningful regions, measure and quantify cardiac function, measure the timing of neurons, and detect brain abnormalities that would lead to seizures.  One potential future application of CNN microprocessors is to combine them with DNA microarrays to allow for a near-real time DNA analysis of hundreds of thousands of different DNA sequences.  Currently, the major bottleneck of DNA microarray analysis is the amount of time needed to process data in the form of images, and using a CNN microprocessor, researchers have reduced the amount of time needed to perform this calculation to 7ms.

CNN processors have also been used to generate and analyze patterns and textures.  One motivation was to use CNN processors to understand pattern generation in natural systems.  They were used to generate [[Turing pattern]]s in order to understand the situations in which they form, the different types of patterns which can emerge, and the presence of defects or asymmetries.  Also, CNN processors were used to approximate pattern generation systems that create stationary fronts, [[spatio-temporal pattern]]s oscillating in time, [[hysteresis]], memory, and heterogeneity.  Furthermore, pattern generation was used to aid high-performance image generation and compression via real-time generation of stochastic and coarse-grained biological patterns, texture boundary detection, and pattern and [[texture recognition]] and classification.

==Control and Actuator Systems==

There is an ongoing effort to incorporate CNN processors into sensory-computing-actuating machines as part of the emerging field of Cellular Machines.  The basic premise is to create an integrated system that uses CNN processors for the sensory signal-processing and potentially the decision-making and control.  The reason is that CNN processors can provide a low power, small size, and eventually low-cost computing and actuating system suited for Cellular Machines.  These Cellular Machines will eventually create a Sensor-Actuator Network (SAN), a type of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) which can be used for military intelligence gathering, surveillance of inhospitable environments, maintenance of large areas, planetary exploration, etc.

CNN processors have been proven versatile enough for some control functions.  They have been used to optimize function via a genetic algorithm, to measure distances, to perform optimal path-finding in a complex, dynamic environment, and theoretically can be used to learn and associate complex stimuli. They have also been used to create antonymous gaits and low-level motors for robotic nematodes, spiders, and lamprey gaits using a Central Pattern Generator (CPG).  They were able to function using only feedback from the environment, allowing for a robust, flexible, biologically inspired robot motor system.  CNN-based systems were able to operate in different environments and still function if some of the processing units are disabled.

The variety of dynamical behavior seen in CNN processors make them intriguing for communication systems.  Chaotic communications using CNN processors is being researched due to their potential low power consumption, robustness and spread spectrum features.  The premise behind chaotic communication is to use a chaotic signal for the carrier wave and to use chaotic phase synchronization to reconstruct the original message. CNN processors can be used on both the transmitter and receiver end to encode and decode a given message.  They can also be used for data encryption and decryption, source authentication through watermarking, detecting of complex patterns in spectrogram images (sound processing), and transient spectral signals detection.

CNN processors are neuromorphic processors, meaning that they emulate certain aspects of [[biological neural network]]s.  The original CNN processors were based on mammalian retinas, which consist of a layer of photodetectors connected to several layers of locally coupled neurons.  This makes CNN processors part of an interdisciplinary research area whose goal is to design systems that leverage knowledge and ideas from neuroscience and contribute back via real-world validation of theories.  CNN processors have implemented a real-time system that replicates mammalian retinas, validating that the original CNN architecture chosen modeled the correct aspects of the biological neural networks used to perform the task in mammalian life.  However, CNN processors are not limited to verifying biological neural networks associated with vision processing; they have been used to simulate dynamic activity seen in mammalian neural networks found in the olfactory bulb and locust [[antennal lobe]], responsible for pre-processing sensory information to detect differences in repeating patterns.

CNN processors are being used to understand systems that can be modeled using simple, coupled units, such as living cells, biological networks, physiological systems, and ecosystems.  The CNN architecture captures some of the dynamics often seen in nature and is simple enough to analyze and conduct experiments.  They are also being used for stochastic simulation techniques, which allow scientists to explore spin problems, population dynamics, lattice-based gas models, percolation, and other phenomena.  Other simulation applications include heat transfer, mechanical vibrating systems, protein production, Josephson Transmission Line (JTL) problems, seismic wave propagation, and geothermal structures.  Instances of 3D (Three Dimensional) CNN have been used to prove known complex shapes are emergent phenomena in complex systems, establishing a link between art, dynamical systems and VLSI technology. CNN processors have been used to research a variety of mathematical concepts, such as researching non-equilibrium systems, constructing non-linear systems of arbitrary complexity using a collection of simple, well-understood dynamic systems, studying emergent chaotic dynamics, generating chaotic signals, and in general discovering new dynamic behavior.  They are often used in researching systemics, a trandisiplinary, scientific field that studies natural systems.  The goal of systemics researchers is to develop a conceptual and mathematical framework necessary to analyze, model, and understand systems, including, but not limited to, atomic, mechanical, molecular, chemical, biological, ecological, social and economic systems.  Topics explored are emergence, collective behavior, local activity and its impact on global behavior, and quantifying the complexity of an approximately spatial and topologically invariant system {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}.  Although another measure of complexity may not arouse enthusiasm (Seth Lloyd, a professor from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has identified 32 different definitions of complexity), it can potentially be mathematically advantageous when analyzing systems such as economic and social systems.

Not to be confused with [[Atlas Shrugged]] character, Chick Morrison.
'''Charles Pacific Morrison''' (1878&amp;ndash;1924), an [[United States|American]] [[silent film]] [[actor]], was born April 3, 1878 in [[Morrison, Colorado]]. The grandson of pioneer town founder George Morrison, he was known as "Chick" to many who knew him, a nickname conjunction of his first and middle names.  A keen [[horse riding|horse rider]], he often appeared in riding contests and rodeos throughout the American west.  At Morrison he trained horses for trick and fancy riding as well as break in wild horses. In 1909 [[Essanay Studios]] brought one such horse to Morrison to film some of their famous ''[[Broncho Billy]]'' series of 2-reel thrillers.  Morrison got the director's attention through his expert horsemanship, daring maneuvers, as well as his control over the animals, and was used as a double for the lead actor in some of the more dangerous scenes.

Morrison left Colorado that year for California. From that point onward he appeared in feature films, rapidly growing to prominence in the film making industry.  Soon he played leads, and his success and experience as an animal trainer, especially with horses, put him in great demand for some of the largest pictures made in his era.  Morrison appeared in about 45 films, including ones with [[Charlotte Burton]] in films such as ''[[Rose of San Juan]]'', ''[[Quicksands (1913 film)|Quicksands]]'' and ''[[Calamity Anne, Heroine]]''. During his career he worked for [[Hal Roach Studios]], the [[Broncho Billy Anderson]] and [[Selig Polyscope Company]], and [[Universal Studios]].

Chick's career met a tragic end on June 20, 1924. That day while filming at Hal Roach in [[Los Angeles, California]], Morrison's favorite horse, ''Young Steamboat'', fell backward upon him, killing him instantly at the age of 46. The horse had accompanied Morrison to Hollywood, a horse Chick had often told friends was especially wild and difficult to tame and train.

Chick Morrison was the older brother of another early western film actor, [[Pete Morrison]].

The '''Dugway sheep incident''', also known as the '''Skull Valley sheep kill''', was a 1968 sheep kill that has been connected to [[United States Army]] chemical and biological warfare programs at [[Dugway Proving Ground]] in [[Utah]]. Six thousand [[sheep]] were killed on ranches near the base, and the popular explanation blamed Army testing of [[chemical weapon]]s for the incident, though alternative explanations have been offered. A report, commissioned by Air Force Press Officer Jesse Stay and first made public in 1998, was called the "first documented admission" from the Army that a [[nerve agent]] killed the sheep at [[Skull Valley Indian Reservation|Skull Valley]].

==Background==
Since its founding in 1941, much of the activity at [[Dugway Proving Ground]] has been a closely guarded secret. Activities at Dugway included aerial [[nerve agent]] testing.&lt;ref name=norrell/&gt; According to reports from ''[[New Scientist]]'', Dugway was still producing small quantities of non-infectious [[anthrax]] of a type used in the making of vaccines as late as 1998, 30 years after the United States renounced biological weapons.&lt;ref name= hambling&gt;Hambling, David. "[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8044.html US army plans to bulk-buy anthrax]", ''New Scientist'', September 24, 2005. Retrieved November 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There were at least 1,100 other chemical tests at Dugway during the time period of the Dugway sheep incident. In total, almost {{convert|500000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of nerve agent were dispersed during open-air tests.&lt;ref name=norrell/&gt; There were also tests at Dugway with other [[weapons of mass destruction]], including 332 open-air tests of biological weapons, 74 [[dirty bomb]] tests, and eight furnace heatings of nuclear material under open air conditions to simulate the dispersal of fallout in the case of [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] of aeronautic [[nuclear reactor]]s.&lt;ref name=norrell/&gt;

==Incident==
In the days preceding the Dugway sheep incident the [[United States Army]] at [[Dugway Proving Ground]] conducted at least three separate operations involving nerve agents.&lt;ref name=woolf/&gt; All three operations occurred on March 13, 1968. One involved the test firing of a chemical [[artillery shell]], another the burning of 160 U.S. [[gallon]]s (600 [[litre]]s) of nerve agent in an open air pit and in the third a jet aircraft sprayed nerve agent in a target area about {{convert|27|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Skull Valley. It is the third event that is usually connected to the Skull Valley sheep kill.&lt;ref name=woolf/&gt;

The incident log at Dugway Proving Ground indicated that the sheep incident began with a phone call on March 17, 1968, at 12:30 a.m. The director of the [[University of Utah|University of Utah's]] ecological and epidemiological contact with Dugway, a Dr. Bode, phoned Keith Smart, the chief of the [[ecology]] and [[epidemiology]] branch at Dugway to report that 3,000 [[sheep]] were dead in the [[Skull Valley (Utah)|Skull Valley]] area. The initial report of the incident came to Bode from the manager of a Skull Valley livestock company.&lt;ref name=regis/&gt; The sheep were grazing in an area about {{convert|27|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the proving ground; total sheep deaths of 6,000–6,400 were reported over the next several days as a result of the incident.&lt;ref name=hoeber&gt;Hoeber, Amoretta M. and Douglass, Jr. Joseph D. "The Neglected Threat of Chemical Warfare", ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/2626644 JSTOR]), ''International Security'', Vol. 3, No. 1. (Summer, 1978), pp. 55–82. Retrieved November 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dugway Safety Office's attempt to count the dead sheep compiled a total of 3,843.&lt;ref name= mauroni&gt;Mauroni, Albert J. ''America's Struggle with Chemical-Biological Warfare'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=TiSL-7ghCWwC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=Sheep+kill+dugway&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;sig=GWiDZgfd4IPlO7JF2mrkmt7Oc0M Google Books]), Praeger, [[Westport, Connecticut]]: 2000, p. 40, ({{ISBN|0275967565}}). Retrieved November 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible causes==
Previously&lt;!--to what?--&gt; obtained documents said a nerve agent demonstration occurred the day before the sheep deaths.&lt;ref name=lethal/&gt;
On March 13, 1968, an [[Douglas_A-4_Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawk]] attack aircraft flew a test mission over the Dugway Proving Ground with chemical dispensers containing the [[VX (nerve agent)|nerve agent VX]]. One of the dispensers was not completely emptied during the test, and as the A-4 gained altitude after its bombing run, VX trickled out in a trail behind the aircraft, drifted into Skull Valley, north of the proving ground, and settled over a huge flock of sheep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vectorsite.net/twgas_2.html "A History Of Chemical Warfare], Greg Goebel  (Accessed on January 31, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation in the aftermath of the incident was that a [[Chemical weapon|chemical]] or [[Biological weapon|biological agent]] had escaped from the Dugway Proving Ground. Circumstantial evidence seemed to support this assertion; the [[United States Army]] admitted to conducting open-air tests with VX in the days preceding the sheep kill. The Army intimated that a spray nozzle had malfunctioned during the test causing an aircraft to continue spraying VX as it climbed to higher altitudes.&lt;ref name=regis&gt;[[Ed Regis (author)|Regis, Edward]]. ''The Biology of Doom: The History of America's Secret Germ Warfare Project'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=8HWQ1uzybFwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Biology+of+Doom:+The+History+of+America%27s+Secret+Germ+Warfare+Project&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U0nG9FNBk6G7e9-XBGOKnumrCCrEQ Google Books]), Owl Books, 2000, p. 209, ({{ISBN|080505765X}}). Retrieved October 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hoeber/&gt; It was reported that a small amount of VX was found in the tissue of the dead sheep.&lt;ref name=hoeber/&gt;

Other information contradicted the initial assumptions. One contradiction to nerve agent exposure as a cause came in the symptoms of some of the sheep following the incident. Several sheep, still alive, sat unmoving on the ground. The sheep refused to eat, but exhibited normal breathing patterns and showed signs of [[Internal hemorrhage|internal hemorrhaging]]. Regular breathing and internal hemorrhaging are inconsistent with nerve agent exposure,&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; and "no other animals of any type, including cows, horses, dogs, rabbits, or birds, appeared to have suffered any ill effects, a circumstance that was hard to explain if VX had in fact caused the sheep deaths."&lt;ref name=regis/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The incident affected the Army, and U.S. military policy within a year. The international infamy of the incident contributed to President Richard Nixon's decision to ban all open-air chemical weapon testing in 1969.&lt;ref name=norrell/&gt; The sheep incident was one of the events which helped contribute to a rise in public sentiment against the [[Chemical Corps|U.S. Army Chemical Corps]] during and after the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=mauroni2&gt;Mauroni, Al.

Retrieved October 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the Chemical Corps was almost disbanded as a result.&lt;ref name=mauroni2/&gt;

Following the incident, the Army and other state and federal agencies compiled reports, some of which were later characterized as "studies".&lt;ref name=woolf/&gt; A report which remained classified until 1978 and unreleased to the public until nearly 30 years after the incident was called the "first documented admission" by the Army that VX killed the sheep. In 1998, Jim Woolf, reporting for ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', made the content of the report public for the first time.&lt;ref name=norrell&gt;Norrell, Brenda. "[http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/285387/skull_valleys_nerve_gas_neighbors/ Skull Valley's Nerve Gas Neighbors]", ([http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/results/docview/docview.do?risb=21_T2578521527&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T2578521532&amp;cisb=22_T2578521531&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=227171&amp;docNo=1 LexisNexis]), ''Indian Country Today'' ([[Rapid City, South Dakota]]), October 26, 2005. Retrieved November 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The report described the evidence that nerve agent was the cause of the sheep kill as "incontrovertible".&lt;ref name=woolf/&gt; The 1970 report, compiled by researchers at the U.S. Army's [[Edgewood Arsenal]] in [[Maryland]], stated that VX was found in both snow and grass samples recovered from the area three weeks after the sheep incident.

The report concluded that the "quantity of VX originally present was sufficient to account for the death of the sheep."&lt;ref name=woolf&gt;Woolf, Jim.

Also, the probe showed that medical tests the Army had used to claim humans were not affected are now considered inconclusive, and the Pecks had shown other signs of low-level VX exposure.&lt;ref name=lethal&gt;[http://www.project-112shad-fdn.com/Background_Lethal%20Breeze.htm "Lethal breeze"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031012101/http://project-112shad-fdn.com/Background_Lethal%20Breeze.htm |date=October 31, 2013 }} By Lee Davidson, Correspondent ''Deseret News'' Sunday, June 5, 1994 Retrieved July 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
This incident formed the basis for the 1972 motion picture ''[[Rage (1972 film)|Rage]]'', directed by and starring George C. Scott.

The incident inspired [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[The Stand]]''.

Author [[Richard Kadrey]] used the incident as inspiration for the name of a fictional metal band, Skull Valley Sheep Kill, in his [[Sandman Slim novel]] series.

{{Criminal law}}

The '''rule of felony murder''' is a legal [[doctrine]] in some [[common law]] [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s that broadens the crime of [[murder]]: when an offender kills (regardless of intent to kill) in the commission of a dangerous or enumerated crime (called a [[felony]] in some jurisdictions), the offender, and also the offender's accomplices or co-conspirators, may be found guilty of murder.

The concept of felony murder originates in the rule of [[transferred intent]], which is older than the [[limit of legal memory]]. In its original form, the malicious intent inherent in the commission of any crime, however trivial, was considered to apply to any consequences of that crime, however unintended.

==History==
While there is debate about the original scope of the rule, modern interpretations typically require that the offence be an inherently dangerous one, or one committed in an obviously dangerous manner. For this reason, the felony murder rule is often justified by its supporters as a means of deterring dangerous felonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sidak|first1=J. Gregory|title=Two Economics Rationales for Felony Murder|journal=Cornell Law Review|date=2015|volume=101|page=51|url=http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2016/04/Sidakessayfinalread.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some commentators, the [[common law]] rule dates to the twelfth century and took its modern form in the eighteenth century. The modern conception of the felony murder rule arose in 1716, with [[William Hawkins (serjeant-at-law)|William Hawkins']] [[Hawkins' Treatise of Pleas of the Crown|Treatise of Pleas of the Crown]], during his work on [[English criminal law]]. Hawkins reasoned that malice was implicit in a crime that “necessarily tends to raise Tumults and Quarrels, and consequently cannot but be attended with the danger of personal hurt.” Thus, "this rule should extend to killings in the course of felonies à fortiori."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Binder|first1=Guyora|title=Making the Best of Felony Murder|journal=Boston University Law Review|date=2011|volume=91|page=403|url=http://www.bu.edu/law/journals-archive/bulr/documents/binder.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
In most jurisdictions, to qualify as an underlying offense for a felony murder charge, the underlying offense must present a foreseeable danger to life, and the link between the offense and the death must not be too remote. For example, if the recipient of a [[forgery|forged]] check has a fatal allergic reaction to the ink, most courts will not hold the forger guilty of murder, as the cause of death is too remote from the criminal act.

There are two schools of thought concerning whose actions can cause the defendant to be guilty of felony murder. Jurisdictions that hold to the ''agency theory'' admit only deaths caused by the agents of the crime. Jurisdictions that use the ''proximate cause theory'' include any death, even if caused by a bystander or the police, provided that it meets one of several [[proximate cause]] tests to determine if the chain of events between the offence and the death was short enough to have legally caused the death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilliard|first1=James W.|title=Felony Murder in Illinois The "Agency Theory" vs. the "Proximate Cause Theory": The Debate Continues|journal=Southern Illinois University Law Journal|date=2001|volume=25|page=331|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/siulj25&amp;div=23&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[lesser included offense|merger doctrine]] excludes from the offenses that qualify as underlying offenses any felony that is presupposed by a murder charge. For example, nearly all murders involve some type of [[assault]], but so do many cases of [[manslaughter]]. To count any death that occurred during the course of an assault as felony murder would obliterate a distinction that is carefully set by the legislature. However, merger may not apply when an assault against one person results in the death of a different person.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=State v. Huynh, 92 P. 3d 571, 278 Kan. 99 (2004)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=194887890465650713|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Felony murder is typically the same grade of murder as premeditated murder and carries the same sentence as is used for premeditated murder in the jurisdiction in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fletcher|first1=George P.|title=Reflections on Felony-Murder|journal=Southwestern University Law Journal|date=1980|volume=12|page=413|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/swulr12&amp;div=30&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of the felony murder rule argue that the rule is unjust because it requires no intent to kill.&lt;ref name="crump"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crump|first1=David|title=Reconsidering the Felony Murder Rule in Light of Modern Criticism: Doesn't the Conclusion Depend upon the Particular Rule at Issue|journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy|date=2009|page=1155|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/hjlpp32&amp;div=57&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, 20-year-old Florida resident [[Ryan Holle]] was convicted of first-degree murder for lending his car to a friend, who used the car in a burglary during which a murder was committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/04/us/04felony.html
|title=Serving Life for Providing Car to Killers
|first=Adam
|last=Liptak
|publisher=The New York Times
|date=12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In favor of the rule, it can be argued that the rule affirms the principle of the sanctity of human life by imposing harsher penalties for crimes that destroy human life.&lt;ref name="crump"/&gt;

Some commentators regard the rule of transferred intent as a [[legal fiction]] whereby the law pretends that the person who intended one wrongful act also intends all the consequences of that act, however unforeseen. Others regard it as an example of [[strict liability]] whereby a person who chooses to commit a crime is considered absolutely responsible for all possible consequences of that action. [[Lord Mustill]] regards the historical rule as a convergence of those views.&lt;ref&gt;See statements of Lord Mustill, {{cite web|title=Judgments - Attorney General's Reference No. 3 of 1994|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldjudgmt/jd970724/gneral02.htm|website=www.parliament.uk|accessdate=23 September 2017|date=24 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
The felony murder rule has been abolished in [[England and Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[Homicide Act 1957]] (5 &amp; 6 Eliz.2 c.11), section 1&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1966]], {{cite web|title=Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1966|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/apni/1966/20/section/8|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=U.K. National Archives|accessdate=23 September 2017}}
 (the Homicide Act 1957 did not extend to Northern Ireland, except in relation to [[courts-martial]] by section 17(3) of that Act)&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, it has been held to be unconstitutional, as breaching the principles of fundamental justice.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Vaillancourt'', [1987] 2 SCR 636.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R v Martineau, [1990] 2 SCR 633.&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions (such as [[Victoria, Australia]]), the common law felony murder (called constructive murder) rule has been abolished, but has been replaced by a similar statutory provision in the [[Crimes Act 1958]].&lt;ref&gt;''Crimes Act'' 1958 s.3A&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in NSW (New South Wales), common law has been overridden and the question needs only be dealt with through statutory construction and application.&lt;ref name="Ryan v R 2001"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|21|2001|litigants=Vincent Ryan v R |parallelcite=(2001) 206 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 267 |date=3 May 2001 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
§ 18(1)(a) of the ''Crimes Act 1900'' (NSW) provides the ''statutory'' definition of ‘constructive murder’. The act or omission causing death must be ‘done in an attempt to commit or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years’.&lt;ref name="s18 Crimes Act NSW"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|18}}(1)(a).&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale is to discourage acts of felony which are dangerous to human life.

''Ryan v R'' &lt;ref name="Ryan v R 1967"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|2|1967|litigants=Robert Ryan v R |parallelcite=(1967) 121 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 205 |date=3 March 1967 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; clarifies the elements of constructive murder. The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt: (1) a base offence with 25 years’ imprisonment or more; and that (2) the act causing death occurred in attempt, during, or immediately after this base offence. This means that the prosecution must prove both the actus reus and mens rea of this ''base offence''. ''R v Munro''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Munro'' (1981) 4 [[Australian Criminal Reports|A Crim R]] 67 [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court (Full Court)]] (NSW, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that the mens rea of the ''act causing death'' is not required to prove constructive murder. For example, the accused may commit an act causing death in the course of robbery or armed robbery without any intention to kill, to inflict grievous bodily harm, or with reckless indifference to human life.

===Canada===
{{see also|Murder (Canadian law)}}
As Canadian criminal law aims to maintain proportionality between the stigma and punishment attached to a conviction and the moral blameworthiness of an offender, in ''[[R v Martineau]]'' the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] held that it is a principle of fundamental justice under sections 7 and 11(d) of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] that a conviction for murder requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a ''subjective foresight of death''. In so doing, the court declared sections 230 and 229(c) of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']] to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="carswell.com"&gt;Edited case version in {{cite book|last=Stuart|first=Don|title=...Criminal Law|year=2009|location=p.443-p.455|url=http://www.carswell.com/description.asp?docid=6067|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S. 230 provided that a conviction for murder would lie for any killing that was "objectively foreseeable as a result of the abominable nature of the predicate crimes...''[[inter alia]]''...coupled with intentional infliction of bodily harm".&lt;ref name="carswell.com"/&gt; This largely equated with a Canadian form of felony murder, though it is technically closer to constructive murder{{elucidate|date=July 2013}} in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;See dissent by L'Heureux-Dubé, Edited case, version in {{cite book|last=Stuart|first=Don|title=...Criminal Law|year=2009|location=p.443-p.455|url=http://www.carswell.com/description.asp?docid=6067|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, according to s. 229(c) it was sufficient for a person to do anything that he "''ought to know'' is likely to cause death".

Nevertheless, s. 229(c), as far as it provides for a form of constructive murder in situations where "an accused for an unlawful object did anything ''knowing'' that it was likely [on an objective standard] to cause someone's death" is still operative, as confirmed in a 1999 appellate court decision.&lt;ref name="carswell.com"/&gt;

Bill C-39 has been introduced in 2017 in order to repeal s. 230 and modify s. 229(c).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-39/first-reading Bill C-39]: An Act to amend the Criminal Code (unconstitutional provisions) and to make consequential amendments to other Acts&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other common law jurisdictions, Canada's Criminal Code specifically enumerates offences to account for instances where (a) person(s) is/are unintentionally killed during the commission of a crime (for example, criminal negligence causing death and impaired driving causing death). In cases where multiple deaths are caused by the same criminal act, the accused will face a separate charge for each death caused. While such charges are not considered to be murder under Canadian law, the maximum penalty for such offences is still life imprisonment - although unlike murder this is not a mandatory sentence and is only very rarely imposed. The main difference between a sentence of life imprisonment for murder and a sentence of life imprisonment for an offence such as criminal negligence causing death is that in the latter case, the offender is eligible for parole after serving seven years.

===Ireland===
The rule was abolished in the [[Republic of Ireland]] by section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1964 which codified the ''[[mens rea]]'' for [[murder]] as intention to kill or seriously injure another person.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales, Northern Ireland====
The rule was abolished in [[England and Wales]] by section 1 of the [[Homicide Act 1957]], and in [[Northern Ireland]] by section 8 of the [[Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1966]]; but its effect is preserved by the application of the Common Law principle of "Joint Enterprise". In England and Wales, the definition of murder requires only an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to the victim, rather than specific intent to kill; the effect is the same as that of the felony murder rule applied to crimes of personal violence, though not to all felonies.

====Scotland====
There is no equivalent to the felony murder rule in [[Scots Law]], which has also never had a specific concept of ''felonies'' in the previous style of English Law. However, the Scots equivalent of "Joint Enterprise" known as "Art and Part" also has a similar effect.

===United States===
{{see also|Felony murder and the death penalty in the United States}}

{{As of|2008|8}}, 46 states in the United States have a felony murder rule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mays|first1=G. Larry|last2=Ball|first2=Jeremy|last3=Fidelie|first3=Laura|title=Criminal Law: Core Concepts|date=2015|publisher=Publisher|isbn=1454846674|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1MLfDgAAQBAJ|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; under which felony murder is generally [[first-degree murder]]. In 24 of those states, it is a [[Capital Punishment|capital offense]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|title=Enmund v. Florida, 458 US 782, 102 S. Ct. 3368, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1140 (1982)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9453688974621954070|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=23 September 2017}} ("Thirty-six state and federal jurisdictions presently authorize the death penalty. Of these, only eight jurisdictions authorize imposition of the death penalty solely for participation in a robbery in which another robber takes life.[5] Of the remaining 28 jurisdictions, in 4 felony murder is not a capital crime.")&lt;/ref&gt; When the government seeks to [[Felony Murder and the Death Penalty|impose the death penalty on someone convicted of felony murder]], the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] has been interpreted so as to impose additional limitations on the state power. The death penalty may not be imposed if the defendant is merely a [[Enmund v. Florida|minor participant]] and did not actually kill or intend to kill. However, the death penalty may be imposed if the defendant is a [[Tison v. Arizona|major participant]] in the underlying felony and exhibits extreme indifference to human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Are Homicide and Murder|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-are-homicide-and-murder|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=23 September 2017|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states recognize the [[Merger doctrine (criminal law)|merger doctrine]], which holds that a criminal [[assault]] cannot serve as the predicate felony for the felony murder rule.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie, R.J. et al.  ''Criminal Law, Second Edition.''  Foundation Press, New York, NY: 2004, p. 865&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid the need for reliance upon common law interpretations of what felony conduct merges with murder, and thus what offenses do and do not qualify for felony murder, many U.S. jurisdictions explicitly list what offenses qualify in a felony murder statute. [[Federal government of the United States|Federal]] law specifies additional crimes, including [[terrorism]], [[kidnapping]], and [[carjacking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=18 U.S. Code § 1111 - Murder|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Law Institute]]'s [[Model Penal Code]] does not include the felony murder rule, but allows the commission of a felony to raise a presumption of extreme indifference to the value of human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonnie|first1=Richard J.|last2=Coughlin|first2=Anne M.|last3=Jeffries|first3=John C., Jr., ,|last4=Low|first4=Peter W.|title=Criminal Law|edition=2|date=2004|publisher=Foundation Press, 2004|isbn=1587787202|page=860|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jbhPAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Law Institute Model Penal Code, § 210.2(1)(b) (Official Draft, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the felony murder rule is effectively used as a rule of [[evidence]]. The Model Penal Code lists [[robbery]], [[rape]] or [[forcible deviant sexual intercourse]], [[arson]], [[burglary]], and felonious escape.

{{Redirect|Buggers|other uses of the term "bugger"|Bugger (disambiguation)}}
{{No footnotes|date=July 2011}}
The '''Formics''', also known as '''Buggers''', are a fictional ant-like [[Extraterrestrial life|alien species]] from the [[Ender's Game series]] of science fiction novels by [[Orson Scott Card]].

According to the novel [[canon (fiction)|canon]], the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as [[Mazer Rackham]]. The first book in the series, [[Ender's Game]], largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.

==Name==
The term "Formic" is derived from ''[[formica]]'', the [[Latin]] word for ''ant''; whereas "bugger" is a [[pejorative]] used by humans; yet it was not until 1999's ''[[Ender's Shadow]]'' that the term 'Formic' was first used, interchangeably with 'Bugger'. Later books used 'Formic' almost exclusively, as the more 'scientific' term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as "Buggers" in ''Ender's Game'',{{ref|eg}} chronologically next as "Formics" in ''[[Ender in Exile]]'',{{ref|ex}} and again as "Buggers" in ''Speaker for the Dead'' and ''Xenocide''.{{ref|xn}} The [[Ender's Game (film)|feature film adaptation of ''Ender's Game'']] uses "Formics" exclusively.

==Biology==
The Formic species consists of [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive-minded]] colonies directed by [[queen (insect)|queens]]. While often described as "insectoid", the Formics are [[warm-blooded]], and they [[Respiration (physiology)|respire]] and [[perspiration|perspire]]. If a queen dies, all the workers under her control lose their ability to function immediately; but in ''[[Xenocide]]'', implications exist that 'workers' can escape the influence of a queen. The Formic race is revealed to be [[Trimorphism|trimorphic]] in ''[[Shadows in Flight]]''. Drones are much smaller and depend on a [[The Hive Queen|Hive Queen]] for survival, and their bodies are shaped to spend their lives clinging to her, until upon her death, they take flight to seek out a new queen. Drones are capable of individual thought and action as well as mind-to-mind communication, more limited than that of a queen; whereas queens communicate instantaneously and can even do so with other species. Formics live in vast underground colonies, usually without light, informing the assumption that Formics make use of sensory apparatus outside the range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] visible to humans. In the first novel they have artificial lighting; whereas in ''[[Xenocide]]'', [[Ender Wiggin|Ender]] claims they rely on heat signature.

==Biography==
He began his business career conducting various businesses with [[Francisco Macías Nguema]], the then dictator of [[Equatorial Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2004/11/15/espana/1100499055.html La azarosa vida del espía 'Paco'] in elmundo.es&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 he was arrested by [[Interpol]] in Belgium and imprisoned in Switzerland and it is believed that he collaborated with the paramilitary group [[GAL (paramilitary group)|GAL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.es/cultura/abci-francisco-paesa-paco-espia-espanol-resucito-y-ahora-aparece-papeles-panama-201605270322_noticia.html Francisco Paesa «Paco», el espía español que resucitó y ahora aparece en los papeles de Panamá ] in abc.es&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sokoa Operation===
After serving his [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] in 1986 he posed as an arms dealer who sold two antiaircraft missiles to [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]. The terrorist group did not know that the missiles had a location signal. The police could find at Henday in France during July 1986 and for the first time, a major hideout in which a large number of weapons and documents were stored. Until then, the Spanish government knew virtually nothing about ETA logistics {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} and this operation was an important turning point.

Judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] issued a warrant of arrest for Francisco Paesa on December 1, 1988 for collaboration with armed band and use of false identities.

===Roldán===
[[Luis Roldán]], known for being the Director General of the Spanish Civil Guard when a big scandal of corruption arose in 1993, have said that Paesa tricked him into stealing all the money that Roldán had previously stolen in that case&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2014-05-19/paesa-se-quedo-con-todo-el-dinero-y-ademas-el-ministro-belloch-le-pago-1-8-millones_131783/ Paesa se quedó con todo el dinero y además el ministro Belloch le pagó 1,8 millones"] in elconfidencial.com&lt;/ref&gt; but the judicial case on the research to hide the heritage of Luis Roldán was filed in 2004, as the crime had prescribed.

===Alleged death and later years===
In 1998 he faked a fatal cardiac arrest in Thailand. Obituaries were published&lt;ref&gt;[http://estaticos02.cache.el-mundo.net/documentos/2004/11/15/esquela.jpg Obituary of Francisco Paesa]&lt;/ref&gt; and a death certificate was forged. His family even commissioned thirty [[Gregorian Masses]] for his soul. The Spanish authorities believed that he had faked his death and he had escaped with two billion pesetas (given to him by Roldán).

He reappeared on Spanish media in 2004. He was mentioned as an organizer of an operation to overthrow [[Equatorial Guinea]] dictator [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo|Obiang]] with an army of mercenaries. 
Some say that Francisco Paesa was spotted by a detective agency in Barcelona, others in France and some in Luxembourg. However, everyone agreed that he had an Argentine passport with the name Francisco Pando Sánchez.

In December 2005, the magazine ''[[Interviú]]'' surprised him in Paris, where he was interviewed by director {{Interlanguage link multi|Manuel Cerdán|es}}. He was 68 years old and his figure was impeccable. He explained that "his death" had been a misunderstanding, since it was reported that he was one of the three people who died in a shooting in [[Bangkok]]. He was willing to show the scars. As for the Russian mafia, he asked journalists to not publish the photos because that would force him to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article746090.ece G. Keely en Timesonline]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, the magazine ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' published an exclusive interview with Paesa. According to Paesa, his supposed death in Thailand was a misunderstanding; he was on an Anti-Terrorism commission from the Argentine Government when he was shot, wounded in action and taken to an unknown boat where he spent 7 months in a coma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.revistavanityfair.es/la-revista/articulos/entrevista-espia-francisco-paesa-vanity-fair/22845|title=Entrevistamos en exclusiva a Paesa, el espía más oscuro y famoso de España|date=2016-09-15|newspaper=Vanity Fair|access-date=2017-02-11|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
The 2016 Spanish film ''[[Smoke &amp; Mirrors (2016 film)|Smoke &amp; Mirrors]]'' is based on his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europapress.es/andalucia/cultura-00621/noticia-hombre-mil-caras-nueva-pelicula-alberto-rodriguez-encuentra-pleno-rodaje-madrid-20150811170024.html Europapress 11/08/2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''György Cziffra Jr.''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈɟørɟ ˈt͡sifrɒ|lang}}; 1943–1981) was a Hungarian [[conducting|conductor]]. His father was the famous pianist [[György Cziffra]] who had served in the Hungarian forces during [[World War II]], and was arrested for political reasons by [[Marxism–Leninism|communist]] authorities after [[World War II]]. In 1956 the family fled Hungary, settling in France.

He trained as a pianist, but decided to turn to conducting. He and his father worked together on several recordings and live performances.

Cziffra died in a fire at his house in the Paris suburbs. His father was heartbroken, and from that day on he never performed or recorded with an orchestra again.

'''Hans Willem van Aylva''' (ca. 1633, [[Holwerd]] - 21 February 1691, near [[Leuven]]) was a Dutch soldier.

In 1667 he participated in the Dutch [[Raid on Medway]]. He was appointed a [[Major General]] in 1668 and promoted to [[Lieutenant General]] four years later.&lt;ref&gt;Childs p.344&lt;/ref&gt; He was also [[Lieutenant Admiral]] of [[Friesland]]. He saw a great deal of service in the [[Franco-Dutch War]] during the 1670s, and was badly wounded at the [[Battle of Seneffe]] in 1674.

Following the outbreak of the [[Nine Years War]] he commanded a small Dutch army that took part in early operations around [[Cologne]] where he co-operated with German forces under [[Hans Adam von Schöning]].&lt;ref&gt;Childs p.103&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of Walcourt]] (1689) he led a mixed force of English and Dutch soldiers. In 1690 he arrived just too late to fight at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1690)|Battle of Fleurus]], but his troops were able to allow [[Prince Georg Friedrich of Waldeck|Waldeck]]'s defeated Allied army to retreat safely.&lt;ref&gt;Childs p.145&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year he died after falling from his horse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5735">'''Helicase-dependent amplification''' (HDA) is a method for ''[[in vitro]]'' [[DNA]] amplification (like the [[polymerase chain reaction]]) that takes place at a constant temperature.

==Introduction==
The polymerase chain reaction is the most widely used method for ''in vitro'' DNA amplification for purposes of molecular biology and biomedical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Science | volume=239 | issue=4839 | pages=487–491 | year=1988   |vauthors=Saiki RK, etal | title=Primer-directed enzymatic amplification of DNA with a thermostable DNA polymerase | pmid=2448875 | doi = 10.1126/science.2448875 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process involves the separation of the double-stranded DNA in high heat into single strands (the denaturation step, typically achieved at 95–97&amp;nbsp;°C), annealing of the primers to the single stranded DNA (the annealing step) and copying the single strands to create new double-stranded  DNA (the extension step that requires the DNA polymerase) requires the reaction to be done in a [[thermal cycler]].  These bench-top machines are large, expensive and costly to run and maintain, limiting the potential applications of DNA amplification in situations outside the laboratory (e.g., in the identification of potentially hazardous micro-organisms at the scene of investigation, or at the point of care of a patient). Although PCR is usually associated with thermal cycling, the original patent by Mullis et al. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | patent= U.S. Patent No. 4,683,195,}}&lt;/ref&gt; disclosed the use of a helicase as a means for denaturation of double stranded DNA thereby including isothermal nucleic acid amplification.
''In vivo'', DNA is replicated by DNA polymerases with various accessory proteins, including a DNA helicase that acts to separate the DNA by unwinding the DNA double helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Kornberg A, Baker T | year=1992 | title=DNA Replication, 2nd edn| publisher=WH Freeman and Company: New York | isbn=978-1-891389-44-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;   HDA was developed from this concept, using a [[helicase]] (an [[enzyme]]) to denature the DNA.

== Methodology ==

Strands of double stranded DNA are first separated by a DNA helicase and coated by single stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding proteins. In the second step, two sequence specific primers hybridise to each border of the DNA template. DNA polymerases are then used to extend the primers annealed to the templates to produce a double stranded DNA and the two newly synthesized DNA products are then used as substrates by DNA helicases, entering the next round of the reaction. Thus, a simultaneous chain reaction develops, resulting in exponential amplification of the selected target sequence (see Vincent ''et al.''., 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=EMBO Rep | volume=5 | issue=8 | pages=795–800 | year=2004  |vauthors=Vincent M, Xu Y, Kong H | title=Helicase-dependent isothermal DNA amplification | pmid=15247927 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400200 | pmc=1249482}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a schematic diagram).

== Present progress and the advantages and disadvantages of HDA ==

Since the publication of its discovery, HDA technology is being used for a "simple, easy to adapt nucleic acid test for the detection of ''Clostridium difficile''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Mol Diagn |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=452–8 |year=2008 |vauthors=Chow WH, McCloskey C, Tong Y, Hu L, You Q, Kelly CP, Kong H, Tang YW, Tang W |title=Application of isothermal helicase-dependent amplification with a disposable detection device in a simple sensitive stool test for toxigenic Clostridium difficile |url=http://jmd.amjpathol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18669881 |pmid=18669881 |doi=10.2353/jmoldx.2008.080008 |pmc=2518740 }}{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other applications include the rapid detection of ''Staphylococcus aureus '' by the amplification and detection of a short DNA sequence specific to the bacterium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biohelix.com/products/IsoAmp_Staph_Kit.asp |publisher=Biohelix corp. |title=IsoAmp Rapid Staph Detection Kit (product description) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010074519/http://www.biohelix.com/products/IsoAmp_Staph_Kit.asp |archivedate=2009-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages of HDA is that it provides a rapid method of nucleic acid amplification of a specific target at an isothermic temperature that does not require a thermal cycler.  However, the optimisation of primers and sometimes buffers is required beforehand by the researcher.  Normally primer and buffer optimisation is tested and achieved through PCR, raising the question of the need to spend extra on a separate system to do the actual amplification.  Despite the selling point that HDA negates the use of a thermal cycler and therefore allows research to be conducted in the field, much of the work required to detect potentially hazardous microorganisms is carried out in a research/hospital lab setting regardless. At present, mass diagnoses from a great number of samples cannot yet be achieved by HDA, whereas PCR reactions carried out in [[thermal cycler]] that can hold multi-well sample plates allows for the amplification and detection of the intended DNA target from a maximum of 96 samples.  The cost of purchasing reagents for HDA are also relatively expensive to that of PCR reagents, more so since it comes as a ready-made kit.

The '''Japanese submarine ''I-168''''' ('''''I-68''''', until 20 May 1942) was a [[Kaidai type submarine|''Kaidai'' type]] of [[cruiser submarine]] active in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Jentschura"/&gt; A KD6 [[ship class|sub-class]] boat, ''I-168'' was built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) in the early 1930s. At the [[Battle of Midway]] she sank the only [[United States Navy|American]] warships lost in the battle: the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5}} and the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Hammann|DD-412}}. At that time she was commanded by Lieutenant Commander Yahachi Tanabe.

==Early career==
The submarine was completed at the Kure Dock Yard on 31 July 1934. She was originally designated ''I-68''. On 23 November 1941, ''I-68'' and the rest of Submarine Squadron 3 were stationed near [[Hawaii]] to perform reconnaissance duties in preparation for the impending [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Still on station near Hawaii on December 13, ''I-68'' was subjected to 21 separate depth charge attacks. The last attack damaged her batteries and flooded the aft torpedo tubes. After undergoing repairs at [[Kwajalein]], ''I-68'' conducted several uneventful patrols in the Pacific, before being redesignated ''I-168'' on 20 May 1942 as part of a general submarine re-numbering program undertaken by the IJN.

==Battle of Midway==
''I-168'' was one of 13 submarines forming the Advance Expeditionary Force of the Japanese attack on Midway. Under the command of Tanabe Yahachi, she steamed south of Midway as far as Kure Island during her approach on 31 May 1942. The American aircraft carriers had passed through the area of the submarine patrol line before the submarines arrived on their patrol stations. ''I-168'' spent the first three days of June observing Midway's southern horizon through the periscope by day and through binoculars at a range of five miles at night. ''I-168'' observed and reported heavy aircraft activity indicating the island anticipated the Japanese attack. She made periscope observations during the first Japanese air attack on Midway. ''I-168'' commenced shelling Midway with its 10-cm (4-inch) deck gun at 0130 5 June; but submerged when illuminated by shore searchlights after firing only 6 rounds.&lt;ref&gt;Tanabe, May 1963, pp.60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

''I-168'' was unsuccessfully attacked by aircraft on 5 June; and upon surfacing after the attack, received orders to sink the damaged American aircraft carrier USS ''Yorktown''.  Lookouts detected ''Yorktown'', and the destroyer ''Hammann'' alongside her at 0530 6 June. ''I-168'' closed the range from 11 miles at six knots, and then slowed to three knots for the final approach through ''Yorktown'''s destroyer screen. Over-cautious use of the periscope resulted in getting too close to the carrier on the initial approach, so the submarine circled to starboard to increase the range and then fired a salvo of four torpedoes at 1330 from a range of 1200 yards. After observing the torpedo hits, ''I-168'' descended to 200 feet and slowed to three knots directly under ''Yorktown''.  American destroyers ''[[USS Gwin (DD-433)|Gwin]]'', ''[[USS Hughes (DD-410)|Hughes]]'', and ''[[USS Monaghan (DD-354)|Monaghan]]'' dropped 60 depth charges before damaging ''I-168'' at 1530. A depth charge exploding near the bow put out the lights, damaged the forward battery room, sprung the hatches to No. 1 torpedo tube and reduced the submerged depth to 60 feet. All unoccupied crewmen grabbed sacks of rice from forward storage and moved astern to trim the submarine because of the flooding forward. After a few hours of relative quiet, ''I-168'' surfaced an hour before sunset and ran west at 14 knots to charge batteries and ventilate interior spaces. Two American destroyers spotted her at a range of 11000 yards and commenced firing from a range of 6500 yards about 30 minutes later. ''I-168'' submerged and evaded the approaching destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;Tanabe, May 1963, pp.59-65&lt;/ref&gt;

After conducting emergency repairs, Tanabe and his crew limped back to [[Japan]] using only two engines, a journey of twelve days. Following full repairs at [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]], ''I-168'' was placed under the command of Lieutenant Commander Katsuji Watanabe and reassigned to cargo transportation missions to the beleaguered [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Kiska]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Fate==
On 27 July 1943, ''I-168'' engaged the American submarine [[USS Scamp (SS-277)|USS ''Scamp'']] in the [[Steffen Strait]] near [[New Hanover Island]]. After crash-diving his boat under an incoming torpedo, Lieutenant Commander Walter Gale Ebert returned fire, sinking ''I-168'' with all hands.

'''Katrina Mogielnicki Spade''' (born September 9, 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://crosscut.com/2017/09/death-industry-seattle-alternative-aquamation-caitlin-doughty|title=Seattle, you've got a new moniker: 'death-positive'|website=crosscut.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American [[designer]], [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]], and [[death care]] advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/members|title=Order Members {{!}} The Order of the Good Death|work=The Order of the Good Death|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spade is the founder of Recompose, a [[public-benefit corporation]] developing a natural alternative to conventional [[cremation]] and [[burial]]. She was awarded the [[Echoing Green]] Climate Fellowship in 2014 for her work.&lt;ref name="Echoing Green"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.echoinggreen.org/fellows/katrina-spade|title=Katrina Spade {{!}} Echoing Green|website=www.echoinggreen.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Spade grew up in rural [[New Hampshire]] and was raised by a physician and physician's assistant.&lt;ref name="Seattle Times"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/life/from-corpse-to-compost-the-urban-death-projects-modest-proposal/|title=Seattle could get an Urban Death Project human composter in just 7 years|date=2016-10-28|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told the [[The Stranger (newspaper)|Seattle ''Stranger'']] of that time in her life, "We weren't religious, but we saw nature as somehow spiritual."&lt;ref name="The Stranger"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thestranger.com/features/feature/2015/03/03/21792773/the-architect-who-wants-to-redesign-being-dead|title=The Architect Who Wants to Redesign Being Dead|work=The Stranger|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[anthropology]] from [[Haverford College]] in Pennsylvania, then turned her focus to [[sustainable design]] while attending Yestermorrow Design/Build School in [[Vermont]]. At Yestermorrow, Spade helped to build a Pain Mound - a [[compost]]-based [[bioenergy]] system invented by [[Jean Pain]] that can produce heat for up to 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.instructables.com/id/Compost-Heating-System/|title=Compost Heating System |work=Instructables.com|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seattle Times"/&gt; Later, while earning a [[Master of Architecture]] from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], she wrote a [[thesis]] entitled "A Place for the Urban Dead", an idea for which she was awarded the [[Echoing Green]] Climate Fellowship in 2014.&lt;ref name="Echoing Green"/&gt;

== Urban Death Project ==
{{Main|Urban Death Project}}

In considering her own mortality, Spade wanted options more that were environmentally sustainable and allowed family and friends to participate in the care of their loved one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.metropolismag.com/cities/the-urban-death-project-bringing-death-back-into-the-urban-realm/|title=The Urban Death Project: Bringing Death Back Into the Urban Realm|date=2017-02-24|work=Metropolis|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She formulated early ideas about the possibility of human recomposition, but when she learned about the practice of livestock mortality [[compost]]ing, she began work to create the same option for humans.&lt;ref name="The Stranger"/&gt; Spade founded the [[Urban Death Project]] in 2014 with a focus on developing a new system of death care called recomposition, which transforms human bodies into soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/10/inside-machine-will-turn-corpse-compost/ |title=Inside the Machine That Will Turn Your Corpse Into Compost |work=WIRED |access-date=2018-06-13 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is not yet recognized as a legal form of disposition in the United States.&lt;ref name="Seattle Times"/&gt;

== Recompose ==
In 2018, the Urban Death Project dissolved and Spade founded Recompose, a public-benefit corporation. Similar to the Urban Death Project, Recompose is developing a [[patent pending]] process that converts human remains to soil.&lt;ref name=Mindbodygreen&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/recompose-and-the-conservation-burial-movement|title=The Last Thing We Ever Do Is Unsustainable. This Woman Wants To Change That|date=2018-04-03|work=mindbodygreen|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seeks to create a scalable and sustainable alternative to natural burial, particularly for urban dwellers.&lt;ref name=Mindbodygreen/&gt;

&lt;!--This entire section is not specifically about Katrina Spade and should go in an article about alternative death care:
== Alternative end of life options and awareness ==
Authors and advocates such as [[Mark Harris (author)|Mark Harris]] with his book ''Grave Matters: A Journey Through the Modern Funeral Industry to a Natural Way of Burial''&lt;ref name="Grave Matters"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/71189919 |title=Grave Matters: A Journey Through the Modern Funeral Industry to a Natural Way of Burial |last=Harris |first=Donald Mark |date=2007 |publisher=Scribner |isbn=0743277686 |location=New York |oclc=71189919}}&lt;/ref&gt; have contributed to a growing awareness of environmental impacts of existing funeral options. In reference to conventional burial Harris states:  &lt;blockquote&gt;For all its verdant landscaping, the typical [[cemetery]] functions less like a bucolic resting ground for the dead than a landfill for the materials that infuse and encase them. Over time, the typical ten-acre swatch of cemetery ground, for example, contains enough [[coffin]] wood to construct more than 40 houses, nearly 1,000 tons of [[casket]] steel and another twenty thousand tons of vault concrete. Add to that a volume of toxic [[formalin]] nearly sufficient to fill a small backyard swimming pool and untold gallons of [[pesticide]] and weed killer used to keep the cemetery grounds preternaturally green.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gravematters.us/faqs.html |title=Grave Matters - A Journey Through the Modern Funeral Industry to a Natural Way of Burial|website=www.gravematters.us|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Harris also notes that while [[cremation]] limits the use of toxic chemicals such as formaldehyde and preserves land use,&lt;ref name="Grave Matters"/&gt;{{rp|56}} it releases pollutants into the atmosphere as human bodies are incinerated:&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Carbon monoxide]] (a common product of combustion) and fine soot comprise the primary emissions, but [[sulfur dioxide]] (from combustion of the natural gas fuelant) and trace metals (from body parts, among others) may also be produced. Of all emissions, however, [[mercury (element)|mercury]] poses the biggest threat to the health of the living. The toxic metal, which is linked to brain and neurological damage in children, is found in [[dental amalgam]]s. The cremation retort's high temps vaporize any mercury in dental fillings of the deceased, sending the metal up the stack and into the atmosphere. From there it's carried by prevailing winds, some of it falling into lakes and streams, where it's taken up by fish and other aquatic life - and eventually by humans who consume them.&lt;ref name="Grave Matters"/&gt;{{rp|61}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As [[James Barron (journalist)|James Barron]] noted in ''[[The New York Times]]'', partly due to the "weakening hold of religion on American life" and partly due to the affordability of cremation versus burial, cremation rates are rising steadily. "By 2025, the [National Funeral Owners Association] is forecasting that 63.8 percent of the people who die in the United States will be cremated, and by 2035, 78.8 percent,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/nyregion/cremations-increase-in-a-move-away-from-tradition.html?module=WatchingPortal&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;pgType=Homepage&amp;action=click&amp;mediaId=thumb_square&amp;state=standard&amp;contentPlacement=13&amp;version=interna&amp;_r=0|title=In a Move Away From Tradition, Cremations Increase|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Barron wrote.

Partly due to increasing cost of conventional methods, and partly due to growing awareness of environmental impacts, interest in green, or alternative death care options is on the rise. As journalist Tony Rehagen stated in his Bloomberg article, "As cemeteries turn into landfills, Americans are turning to less destructive ways to bury the dead.... Today, a green burial can take many forms. Now that mortals are thinking outside the old pine box, other ways in which to keep our molecules spinning in the life cycle are popping up."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-green-burial/|title=Decompose the Green Way With an Eco-Friendly Funeral|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative end of life options exist across a vast spectrum from [[natural burial]] to eternal reefs, and mushroom suits, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-green-burial/|title=Decompose the Green Way With an Eco-Friendly Funeral|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kherubim''' or Kherans are an [[List of extraterrestrials in fiction|alien race]] in the [[fiction]]al [[Wildstorm Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/24114-wildstorm-vets-reunite-for-oral-history.html |title=WILDSTORM Vets Reunite For Oral History |publisher=[[Newsarama.com]] |date=2015-04-13 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were created by [[Jim Lee]] and first appeared in ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.Ts]]'' #1 (August 1992).

==Biology==
Kherubim are various groups/races of people from the planet Khera. Kherubim resemble humans in appearance but are physically far stronger and more durable and extremely long-lived, nearly [[Immortality|immortal]]. [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]] was harmed by armor-piercing machine gun bullets; however, after they are surgically removed, she makes a full and rapid recovery. Kherans (including Titanthropes) can interbreed with humans, bearing fertile offspring.

An evolutionary drawback to their near-immortality is that nearly all Kheran females are [[infertile]]; only very rarely will a Kheran produce offspring. This is a natural check against overpopulation. Only one in 10,000 Kheran females is capable of giving birth, and only then at her very first mating. Of those, only one in approximately 10,000 will become pregnant, and only 1 in 1000 of those babies will be born alive; the rest are stillborn. The saving grace of the species is that this infertility does not seem to apply when the Kheran is mating with another species, as Earth has various Kheran/human hybrids.

More powerful Kherans are known as Lords and may possess telekinetic and energy manipulation abilities. [[Mister Majestic]], [[Lord Emp]] and [[Spartan (comics)|Yohn Khol]] are Kherubim Lords.
 
Shapers are a [[subspecies]] of Kherans. They are [[shapeshifters]] who are able to manipulate the molecular structure of their bodies, transforming part or all of their bodies into a substance with [[metal]]lic properties, which they can manipulate and reshape at will. The Wildcat [[Warblade (comics)|Warblade]] is a Shaper.

Though genetically a different species, the Titanthropes (or simply Titans) have been part of Kherubim society for so long that they are also often called Kherubim. However, they are considered and treated as second-class citizens of Khera by the Kherubim. They are large, purple-skinned humanoids who are able to increase or decrease their mass. Males have large yellow horns growing from their backs. A Titan's intelligence is inversely proportional to their current size. The Wildcat [[Maul (Wildstorm)|Maul]] is a Titanthrope.

==History==
Thousands of years ago, the Kherubim destroyed their own planet, according to Titan myth. They then came to Khera and settled it, subjugating the Titans. The Titans would slowly become more or less accepted within the Kherubim society but remained [[second-class citizen]]s.

Millennia ago, the Kherans came into contact with the [[Daemonite]]s and a war erupted between both species. This war would last several centuries. A small group of Kherans and Daemonites crashlanded on Earth and inspired humanity with tales of gods, angels, demons, and monsters. Their conflict would continue until the end of the 20th century, while in space the Kherans would go on to defeat the Daemonites. Kherans imposed heavy [[indemnity|indemnities]] on the Daemonites and their society went bankrupt trying to pay them off. Khera allowed Daemonites to migrate to the more prosperous planet, but forced these Daemonites refugees to live in [[ghetto]]s.

When a small group of Kheran and half-Kheran heroes from Earth known as the [[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.Ts]] arrived on Khera, they were welcomed as heroes, but quickly learned that Kheran society had changed over the years. Disgusted with the autocratic nature of Kheran society, they left the planet and returned to Earth.

Later, the Kherubim lord [[Mister Majestic|Majestros]] found hidden Kheran devices, known as Planet Shaper Engines, beneath the surface of the Earth. This caused the realization that humanity and Kherans were closely related and that similar species had been seeded throughout the universe, creating both the Daemonites and Kherans in addition to humans.

The Shaper Guild from Khera arrived on Earth and announced that factions within Kherubim society had decided on using Planet Shaper Engines to transform the Earth into another Khera, causing a civil war.

==Culture==
Kherans are a warrior race with a strong emphasis on hand-to-hand combat and [[honor]].

Due to their low fertility, every Kheran man and woman coming of age has to mate with an appointed partner. If the woman gives birth, she must become a priestess. If not, she may go on to live her life as she wishes. [[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lady Zannah]] has managed to avoid becoming a priestess, despite giving birth, because her mother told others that the baby had died, allowing Zannah to become a warrior. Her mother then passed Zannah's baby, [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Kenesha]], off as Zealot's sister. As a mother of two children, Zannah's mother, Harmony, has become a living legend. No Kheran can remember the last time a Kheran woman gave birth to more than one child in her life. Zannah became the founder of the [[Coda (Wildstorm)|Coda]] Sisterhood.

Older and more powerful Kherans are named Lords. It remains unclear what makes a Kheran a Lord, but a Lord is capable of undergoing the ritual of Ascension when he is ready. The Ascension ritual is an important part of the Kheran culture, where a Lord asks a partner or good friend to destroy his body so that his spirit can be free. A Lord usually has so much energy stored in his body that this process tends to consume both Kherans.

The Coda worship a goddess, Hecate, but little is known about this religion. Other Kherans apparently do not worship any gods but believe in individual enlightenment through Ascension.

Though originally seen as noble and protective of other species, the Kherans were later shown to be quite [[speciesism|speciesist]], looking down upon other species while perceiving themselves as tolerant and benevolent.

==Politics==
The Kherans have a political system where various parties vie for power. The various factions include:
*The Pantheon, the party of the Lords. They are currently in power and stand for stability and economic progress.
*The Coda, a sisterhood of warriors. They want war and combat to prove their worth.
*The Shapers Guild represents all Shapers within Kheran society. They follow the orders from the Pantheon but have their own secret agenda. They claim to shape the destiny of Khera and are aware of its true origin.
*The Titantropes, while individually repressed by the Kherubim, hold great power as a faction. While being only a small political faction, it is in fact their vote that either keeps the Pantheon in power or puts the Coda in power.
* The Brotherhood of the Sword: a male version of the Coda, its members are created through [[genetic engineering]] and [[cloning]]. They devote their whole life to the mastery of bladed weapons and suppressing their own emotions. Some Bladesmen sacrifice themselves to become Scimitars, using stolen DNA from the Shapers Guild to become living war machines. The Brotherhood on Earth betrayed Khera and allied themselves with the Daemonites.
* The Adrastea: a race of Kherubim empaths, originally bred to be slaves, but they soon became the largest [[organized crime|crime syndicate]] in Kheran society.

==Technology==
While preferring bladed weapons in combat, Kherans are technologically advanced. They own spaceships capable of interstellar flights. They are capable of inscribing knowledge in the form of organic molecules, which when injected into the bloodstream, downloads that knowledge straight into the brain. They are capable of manipulating the laws of chance, simply for the purpose of entertainment as their 'Coincidental Mansion' shows. Armies of very advanced [[Android (robot)|androids]] known as the [[Spartan (comics)|Spartan Guards]] serve as soldiers. Spartan Guards have shown high intelligence and superhuman physical capabilities. Kherubim Planet Shapers can [[Terraforming|terraform]] worlds and alter living DNA and can remain functional for billions of years.

==Notable Kherans==
*[[Mister Majestic|Lord Majestros]], the greatest living hero for all Kherubim.
*[[Lord Emp]], ascended from the physical plane. Former member of the Pantheon.
*[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lady Zannah]], former member of the Coda.
*[[Savant (Wildstorm)|Kenesha]]
*[[Spartan (comics)|Lord Yohn Kohl]], the template for the android Spartan.
*Lord S'lyton, father of [[Backlash (Marc Slayton)|Marc Slayton]]
*Ferrian, member of [[Wildcore]].
*Charis, also known as [[Nemesis (Wildstorm)|Nemesis]]. An Adrastea with empathic abilities, trained by the Coda.

The '''Kübler-Ross model''' is popularly known as the '''five stages of grief,''' though more accurately, the model postulates a progression of emotional states experienced by terminally ill patients after diagnosis. The five stages are chronologically: [[denial]], [[anger]], [[Bargaining (psychology)|bargaining]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[acceptance]].

The model was first introduced by Swiss-American psychiatrist [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]] in her 1969 book ''[[On Death and Dying]]'', and was inspired by her work with [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,689491,00.html |title= Milestones |date=August 30, 2004 | publisher=TIME | first=Sarah M. | last=Broom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivated by the lack of instruction in medical schools on the subject of death and dying, Kübler-Ross examined death and those faced with it at the [[University of Chicago]] medical school. Kübler-Ross' project evolved into a series of seminars which, along with patient interviews and previous research, became the foundation for her book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uky.edu/~cperring/kr.htm |title=PHI350: The Stages in the Dying Process |first=Christian |last=Perring |access-date=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kübler-Ross is commonly credited with creating stage models, earlier  bereavement theorists and clinicians such as [[Erich Lindemann]], [[Colin Murray Parkes|Collin Murray Parkes]], and [[John Bowlby]] used similar models of stages of phases as early as the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Bereavement groups and the role of social support : integrating theory, research, and practice |last=Hoy |first=William G. |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge/Taylor and Francis |isbn=9781317416357 |location=New York |oclc=942843686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in her life, Kübler-Ross noted that the stages are not a linear and predictable progression and that she regretted writing them in a way that was misunderstood.&lt;ref name=GriefGrieving /&gt; "Kübler-Ross originally saw these stages as reflecting how people cope with illness and dying," observed grief researcher Kenneth J. Doka, "not as reflections of how people grieve."&lt;ref&gt;Doka, Kenneth J., ''Grief Is a Journey: Finding Your Path Through Loss'' (Simon and Schuster, 2016): 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stages of dying in terminal illness ==
The stages, popularly known by the acronym '''DABDA''', include:&lt;ref name="Santrock"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development |last= Santrock |first=J.W. |authorlink= |year= 2007 |publisher= [[McGraw-Hill]] |location= New York |isbn= 0-07-338264-7 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}{{page needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Denial]]''' – The first reaction is denial. In this stage, individuals believe the diagnosis is somehow mistaken, and cling to a false, preferable reality. 
# '''[[Anger]]''' – When the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue, they become frustrated, especially at proximate individuals. Certain psychological responses of a person undergoing this phase would be: "Why me? It's not fair!"; "How can this happen to me?"; "Who is to blame?"; "Why would this happen?".
# '''[[Bargaining]]''' – The third stage involves the hope that the individual can avoid a cause of grief. Usually, the negotiation for an extended life is made in exchange for a reformed lifestyle. People facing less serious trauma can bargain or seek compromise. Examples include the terminally ill person who "negotiates with God" to attend a daughter's wedding or an attempt to bargain for more time to live in exchange for a reformed lifestyle.
# '''[[Depression (mood)|Depression]]''' – "I'm so sad, why bother with anything?"; "I'm going to die soon, so what's the point?"; "I miss my loved one; why go on?"&lt;br /&gt;During the fourth stage, the individual despairs at the recognition of their mortality. In this state, the individual may become silent, refuse visitors and spend much of the time mournful and sullen.
# '''[[Acceptance]]''' – "It's going to be okay."; "I can't fight it; I may as well prepare for it."&lt;br /&gt; In this last stage, individuals embrace mortality or inevitable future, or that of a loved one, or other tragic event. People dying may precede the survivors in this state, which typically comes with a calm, retrospective view for the individual, and a stable condition of emotions.

In a book co-authored with David Kessler and published posthumously, Kübler-Ross expanded her model to include any form of personal loss, such as the death of a loved one, the loss of a job or income, major [[Social rejection|rejection]], the end of a relationship or [[divorce]], [[drug addiction]], [[incarceration]], the onset of a [[disease]] or an [[infertility]] diagnosis, and even minor losses, such as a loss of insurance coverage.&lt;ref name=GriefGrieving&gt;{{Cite book |title=On grief &amp; grieving : finding the meaning of grief through the five stages of loss |last=Kübler-Ross |first=Elisabeth |date=2014 |publisher=Scribner |last2=Kessler |first2=David |isbn=9781476775555 |location=New York |oclc=863077888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Criticisms of this five-stage model of grief center mainly on a lack of [[empirical research]] and [[empirical evidence]] supporting the stages as described by Kübler-Ross and, to the contrary, empirical support for other modes of the expression of grief. Moreover, Kübler-Ross' model is the product of a particular culture at a particular time and might not be applicable to people of other cultures. These points have been made by many experts, [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0030222817691870] such as Professor Robert J. Kastenbaum (1932–2013) who was a recognized expert in gerontology, aging, and death. In his writings, Kastenbaum raised the following points:&lt;ref&gt;Kastenbaum, Robert. ''Death, Society, and Human Experience'', 6th edition. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corr, Charles A., Kenneth J. Doka, and Robert Kastenbaum (1999). "Dying and Its Interpreters: A Review of Selected Literature and Some Comments on the State of the Field." ''Omega: The Journal of Death and Dying'' '''39'''(4) :239–259. doi.org/10.2190/3KGF-52BV-QTNT-UBMX&lt;/ref&gt;
* The existence of these stages as such has not been demonstrated.
* No evidence has been presented that people actually do move from Stage 1 through Stage 5.
* The limitations of the method have not been acknowledged.
* The line is blurred between description and prescription.
* The resources, pressures, and characteristics of the immediate environment, which can make a tremendous difference, are not taken into account.

A 2003 study of bereaved individuals conducted by Maciejewski and colleagues at [[Yale University]] obtained some findings consistent with the five-stage hypothesis but others inconsistent with it. Several letters were also published in the same journal criticizing this research and arguing against the stage idea.&lt;ref name="Jama"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maciejewski |first1=Paul K. |last2=Zhang |first2=Baohui |last3=Block |first3=Susan D. |last4=Prigerson |first4=Holly G. |year=2007 |title=An Empirical Examination of the Stage Theory of Grief |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=297 |issue=7 |pages=716–23 |pmid=17312291 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.7.716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Bonanno]], Professor of Clinical Psychology at Columbia University, in his book ''The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After a Loss'',&lt;ref name="Bonanno2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonanno|first=George|authorlink=George Bonanno|title=The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us about Life After Loss|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HLXuAAAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-01360-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes [[peer-review]]ed research based on thousands of subjects over two decades and concludes that a natural [[psychological resilience]] is a principal component of grief&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bonanno |first1=George A. |title=Loss, trauma, and human resilience: have we underestimated the human capacity to thrive after extremely aversive events? |journal=The American Psychologist |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=20–8 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14736317 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that there are no stages of grief to pass.  Bonanno's work has also demonstrated that absence of grief or trauma symptoms is a healthy outcome.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-neuroscience-of-true-grit |title=The Neuroscience of True Grit |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0311-28 |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The lack of support in peer-reviewed research or objective clinical observation by many practitioners in the field has led to the labels of ''myth'' and ''fallacy'' in the notion that there are stages of grief.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2042372-2,00.html|title=New Ways to Think About Grief|first=Ruth Davis|last=Konigsberg|date=January 29, 2011|publisher=|access-date=November 27, 2016|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/five-fallacies-of-grief/ |title=Five Fallacies of Grief: Debunking Psychological Stages |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |date=2008-11-01 |accessdate=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the model's use has persisted in popular news and entertainment media including the animated sitcom ''The Simpsons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Liam Dominic Fanning|title=The Simpsons: Five Stages of Grief|date=2017-09-09|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ohrjV8hBmC0|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5545">Maternal death or maternal mortality is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as "the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes." The maternal mortality rate, on the other hand, is the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 births. The maternal mortality is used as a criterion for the quality of medical care in a country.

The data shown below represent per capita amounts of meat eaten by humans.

The data in this table can be compared to [[List of countries by meat consumption]] which are simply figures for carcass mass availability (with "carcass mass" for poultry estimated as ready-to-cook mass), divided by population. This includes the amount eaten by humans, as well as losses, which include bones, losses in retail and food service or home preparation (including trim and cooking), spoilage and “downstream” waste, and amounts consumed by pets (compare [[dressed weight]]).

[[Artificial intelligence]] researchers have developed several specialized '''programming languages for artificial intelligence''':

== Languages ==
* [[AIML]] (meaning "Artificial Intelligence Markup Language")&lt;ref name="AIML_Repository"&gt;according to (the intro page to) the [http://nlp-addiction.com/chatbot/aiml/ AIML Repository] at nlp-addiction.com&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[XML]] dialect&lt;ref name="alicebot.org_aiml"&gt;See the [http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html AIML "Intro" (web) page] at www.alicebot.org&lt;/ref&gt; for use with [[Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity|A.L.I.C.E.]]-type [[chatterbot]]s. 
* [[Information Processing Language|IPL]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=46–48}}
&lt;/ref&gt; was the first language developed for artificial intelligence. It includes features intended to support programs that could perform general problem solving, such as lists, associations, schemas (frames), dynamic memory allocation, data types, recursion, associative retrieval, functions as arguments, generators (streams), and cooperative multitasking.
* [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]:
* {{Harvnb|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=723–821}}
* {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=59–62}},
* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18}}
&lt;/ref&gt; is a practical mathematical notation for computer programs based on [[lambda calculus]]. [[Linked list]]s are one of the Lisp language's major [[data structure]]s, and Lisp [[source code]] is itself made up of lists. As a result, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or even new [[domain-specific language|domain-specific programming language]]s embedded in Lisp. There are many dialects of Lisp in use today, among which are [[Common Lisp]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], and [[Clojure]].
* [[Smalltalk]] has been used extensively for simulations, neural networks, machine learning and genetic algorithms. It implements the purest and most elegant form of object-oriented programming using message passing.
* [[Prolog]]&lt;ref&gt;
History of logic programming:
* {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=190–196}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[[Prolog]]:
* {{Harvnb|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=477–491}},
* {{Harvnb|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=641–676, 575–581}}
&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[declarative programming|declarative]] language where programs are expressed in terms of relations, and execution occurs by running ''queries'' over these relations. Prolog is particularly useful for symbolic reasoning, database and language parsing applications. Prolog is widely used in AI today.
* [[STRIPS]] is a language for expressing [[automated planning and scheduling|automated planning problem instance]]s. It expresses an initial state, the goal states, and a set of actions. For each action preconditions (what must be established before the action is performed) and postconditions (what is established after the action is performed) are specified.
* [[Planner (programming language)|Planner]] is a hybrid between procedural and logical languages. It gives a procedural interpretation to logical sentences where implications are interpreted with pattern-directed inference.
* [[POP-11]] is a [[Reflection (computer science)|reflective]], [[dynamic compilation|incrementally compiled]] [[programming language]] with many of the features of an [[interpreted language]]. It is the core language of the [[Poplog]] [[Computer programming|programming]] [[system platform|environment]] developed originally by the [[University of Sussex]], and recently in the [http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/ School of Computer Science] at the [[University of Birmingham]] which hosts [http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html the Poplog website], It is often used to introduce symbolic programming techniques to programmers of more conventional languages like [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], who find POP syntax more familiar than that of [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]]. One of POP-11's features is that it supports [[first-class function]]s.
*[[R (programming language)|R]] is widely used in new-style artificial intelligence, involving statistical computations, numerical analysis, the use of Bayesian inference, neural networks and in general [[Machine Learning]]. In domains like finance, biology, sociology or medicine it is considered as one of the main standard languages. It offers several paradigms of programming like vectorial computation, functional programming and object-oriented programming. It supports deep learning libraries like [[MXNet]], [[Keras]] or [[TensorFlow]]. 
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]] is widely used for artificial intelligence, with packages for a number of applications including General AI, [[Machine Learning]], [[Natural Language Processing]] and [[Neural Network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonForArtificialIntelligence Python For Artificial Intelligence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101045354/http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonForArtificialIntelligence |date=2012-11-01 }} Python Wiki 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] is also a very good programming language for AI. Lazy evaluation and the list and LogicT monads make it easy to express non-deterministic algorithms, which is often the case. Infinite data structures are great for search trees. The language's features enable a compositional way of expressing the algorithms. The only drawback is that working with graphs is a bit harder at first because of purity.
* [[Wolfram Language]] includes a wide range of integrated machine learning capabilities, from highly automated functions like Predict and Classify to functions based on specific methods and diagnostics. The functions work on many types of data, including numerical, categorical, time series, textual, and image.&lt;ref name="Wolfram Language"&gt;[http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/MachineLearning.html Wolfram Language]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[C++]] (2011 onwards)
* [[MATLAB]]
* [[Perl]]
* [[Julia (programming language)]], e.g. for machine learning, using native or non-native libraries.

'''Manfred''' (1306 &amp;ndash; 9 November 1317), ''[[infante]]'' of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], was the second son of [[Frederick III of Sicily]] and [[Eleanor of Anjou]]. 

He was appointed [[Duke of Athens]] and [[Neopatria]] in 1312 by his father at the request of the knights of the [[Catalan Company]] then in control of [[Athens]]. Manfred was only five when he was named Duke. His father sent [[Berenguer Estañol de Ampurias|Berenguer Estañol]] as his [[regent]].

In 1316, [[Alfonso Fadrique]], Manfred's elder (but illegitimate) brother, was appointed [[vicar general]] of Athens. The young Duke never set foot in his realm, however, for he died in a fall from his horse before his twelfth birthday. He died in [[Trapani]] and was buried in the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] church located there. His younger brother [[William II of Athens|William]] succeeded him as Duke.

A '''Merodiploid''' is a partially diploid bacterium, which has its own [[chromosome]] complement and a chromosome fragment introduced by [[Conjugation (acid-base theory)|conjugation]], transformation or [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=merodiploid|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/merodiploid|journal=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be defined as an essentially haploid [[organism]] that carries a second copy of a part of its genome. The term is derived from the Greek, meros = part, and was originally used to describe both unstable partial diploidy, such as that which occurs briefly in recipients after mating with an Hfr strain (1), and the stable state, exemplified by F-prime strains (see Hfr'S And F-Primes). Over time the usage has tended to confine the term to descriptions of stable genetic states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://what-when-how.com/molecular-biology/merodiploids-molecular-biology/|title=Merodiploids (Molecular Biology)|website=What-when-how.com|accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Merodiploidy''' refers to the partial duplication of chromosomes in a haploid organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Natural Genetic Transformation Generates a Population of Merodiploids in Streptococcus pneumoniae|first1=Calum |last1= Johnston |first2=Stéphanie |last2=Caymaris |first3=Aldert |last3=Zomer|first4=Hester J. |last4=Bootsma|first5=Marc |last5=Prudhomme|first6=Chantal |last6=Granadel|first7= Peter W.

'''Genevieve Dolores Gerber''' (April 3, 1894 &amp;ndash; January 2, 1974) was an American [[silent film]] actress who appeared in 128 films between 1912 and 1930. She used the name '''Jean Dolores''' in her last two films.&lt;ref name=eafs/&gt;

==Early life and career==
She was born in [[Argenta, Illinois|Argenta, Illinois,]] to S. Nelson Gerber and Jean Pullman.&lt;ref name="classic"/&gt; Her parents separated when she was young and her mother moved her to [[Los Angeles, California]]. She was raised by nuns from the College of the Immaculate Heart. After the death of her father, Gerber's impoverished mother gave guardianship of her daughter to an attorney.&lt;ref name="lowe"&gt;{{cite book|first=Denise|last=Lowe|year=2004|title=An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Women in Early American Films, 1895-1930|publisher=Haworth Press|isbn=0-7890-1843-8|pages=234-236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her graduation from high school, Gerber became an actress and appeared in several one-reelers. Her film debut came in ''The Flower Girl's Romance'' (1912).&lt;ref name="eafs"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mayer |first1=Geoff |title=Encyclopedia of American Film Serials |date=2017 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9781476627199 |pages=134-135 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCgSDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=%22Genevieve+Dolores+Gerber%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB0s-ipcbeAhUinuAKHaTRCCgQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Genevieve%20Dolores%20Gerber%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=9 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1917, she starred in multiple [[serial film]]s, and she is considered one of the top ten "serial queens" of the [[silent film]] period. She teamed with director and actor [[Ben F. Wilson]] in many of these productions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Strickland, A.W. |author2=Ackerman, Forrest J. |title=A reference guide to American science fiction films|publisher=T.I.S. Publications Division|year=1981|isbn=0-89917-268-7|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; and starred in the first crude sound era serial, ''[[The Voice from the Sky]]'', also directed by Wilson. However, her career stalled in 1930 after Wilson died from heart disease. Gerber retired from acting shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="classic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicimages.com/past_issues/view/?x=/1999/february99/gerber.html|title=Whatever Became of Neva Gerber ?|last=Doyle|first=Billy|date=February 1999|publisher=classicimages.com|accessdate=February 17, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429221625/http://www.classicimages.com/past_issues/view/?x=%2F1999%2Ffebruary99%2Fgerber.html|archivedate=April 29, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Gerber's first marriage was to actor Arthur Nelson Millett on July 22, 1913. They separated the following year. In 1915, she became engaged to director [[William Desmond Taylor]]. The two never married because Gerber was still married to Millett (their divorce became final in 1920), and Taylor was murdered in February 1922. The following year Gerber married contractor Edward Dana Nolan. They later divorced. She remained married to her fourth husband, contractor William Munchoff, until his death in 1960.&lt;ref name="classic"/&gt;

On January 2, 1974, Gerber died of a [[cerebral thrombosis]] in [[Palm Springs, California]]. She was buried in a [[Potter’s field|“pauper's grave”]] in [[Desert Memorial Park]] in [[Cathedral City, California]].&lt;ref name="classic" /&gt;

While known to have constructed smaller dwellings as well, Beauchemin's works were generally large brick tenements with ground-floor storefronts or offices, done in the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style. Among features common to his work were [[festoons|festoon-adorned]] [[friezes]], [[belt courses]] and angled windows placed at a corner of the front facade.

'''Professional mourning''' or '''paid mourning''' is an occupation that originates from Egyptian, Chinese,  [[Mediterranean]] and [[Near East]]ern cultures. Professional [[mourner]]s, also called '''moirologists''', are compensated to lament or deliver a [[eulogy]] and help comfort and entertain the grieving family. Mentioned in the [[Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/topical/naves/m/mourning--hired_mourners.htm|title=Mourning: Hired Mourners|website=Bible Hub}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other religious texts, the occupation is widely invoked and explored in literature, from the [[Ugaritic]] epics of early centuries BC to modern poetry.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; Held in high esteem in some cultures and times, the practice was vilified in others, such as the Chinese Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Corpse Walker|last=Yiwu|first=Liao Yiwu|publisher=Anchor|year=2009|isbn=978-0307388377|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; Female professional mourners also, called ''Rudaali'', were common in many parts of [[India]], especially in the Western Indian state of [[Rajasthan]]

Professional mourning is still practiced in China and other Asian countries. In fact, some cultures even think that the use of professional mourners brings a certain religious and historical application to funeral processions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wnyc.org/story/303342/|title=Belly Dancing For The Dead: A Day With China's Top Mourner|last=Lim|first=Louisa Lim|date=2013-06-23|website=WNYC|accessdate=}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Most of the people hired to perform the act of professional mourning were women. Men were deemed unfit for this because they were supposed to be strong and leaders of the family, unwilling to show any sort of raw emotion like grief, which is why women were professional mourners. It was actually socially acceptable to express grief for women, and expressing grief is important when it comes to mourning a body in terms of religion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forming Femininity in Antiquity|last=Arbel|first=Vita|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=9780199837779|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in a world full of jobs solely made for men, it gave women a sense of pride that they were actually able to earn money in some way.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Mourners were also seen as a sign of wealth. The more wailers or mourners that followed your cascade around, the more respected you were in the society.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mariarosavaldesogo.com/requirements-professional-mourners-ancient-egypt/|title=Requirements of Professional Mourners in Ancient Egypt. - María Rosa Valdesogo|date=2014-10-15|work=María Rosa Valdesogo|access-date=2018-04-28|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Egypt ===
[[File:Egyptian mourners001.jpg|thumb|Egyptian mourners inscribed on a tomb]]
In ancient Egypt,  The mourners would be "making an ostentatious display of grief which included loud wailing, beating exposed breasts, smearing the body with dirt and dishevelled hair; all signs of uncontrolled behavior, the disorder of sorrow" (Capel, 1996). There are many inscriptions on tombs and pyramids of crowds of people following a body throughout the funerary procession.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, the most important of the women were the two that impersonated the two gods Isis and Nephyts.

Isis and Nephyts were both Egyptian gods that were believed to play a special role when someone died. They were to be impersonated as a mourning ritual by professional mourners. In most inscriptions seen, one of them is at either ends of the corpse.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are also rules for impersonation of these two gods, for example the portrayer's body had to be shaved completely, not have any children, and tattooed the names Isis or Nephyts on their shoulders for identification.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Evidence of professional mourning is seen in Ancient Egypt through different pyramid and tomb inscriptions. Different inscriptions show women next to tombs holding their bodies in such ways that show sorrow, such as "hands holding their back of the neck, crossing their arms on their chests, kneeling and/or bending their bodies forwards" (Valdesago, 2014).

=== China ===
Professional mourners have been regular attendees of Chinese funerals since 756.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theater Of The Dead|last=Hong|first=Jeehee|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of professional mourning stemmed from theatrical performances that would occur during funerary processions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; There would be musical performances at funerals stemming as early as the third century. Actors would play the role of the deceased and play out different aspects of their lives, as described in the following scene:

"...set up wooden figures of Xiang Yu and Liu Bang participating in the banquet at Goose Gate. The show lasted quite some time. This performance was part of a funeral procession during the Dali reign (766-779) as the coffin of the deceased was being carried on the streets to his tomb site. The main funerary ritual had taken place at the house of the deceased, and now the mourners were walking in the funeral procession, along with a troupe of performers. The latter performance of this celebrated episode of the feast at the Goose Gate (Hongmen) from the Three Kingdoms saga was preceded by the enactment of a combat scene between two celebrated soldiers in history that was performed alongside the procession" (Hong, 2016).

Most of the historical evidence of mourning exists in the form of inscriptions on the different panels of tombs. Each slab contains a different story, and by the analysis of these inscriptions we are able to tell that these were played out during the funeral. For example:

"Each scene --the preparation of food, the groom with a horse, and the entertainment -- is unfailingly reminiscent of classical representations that adorn many tomb walls or coffin surfaces created since the Hand period...these motifs are generally understood by students of Chinese funerary art as a banquet for the deceased...it is clear they represent the deceased couple because of the motif's strong connection to traditional representations of performances prepared for tomb occupants" (-Hong, 2016)

The idea of entertainment at funerals was not always popular, especially with the government and scholars. In fact, during the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China professional mourning was actually so looked down upon and rallied against by the government that there wasn't a single instance of professional mourning until it was revitalized in the [[Reform era of China|reform era]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.danwei.org/music/professional_mourners.php|title=Performing at funerals: professional mourners in Chongqing and Chengdu|website=www.danwei.org|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the Bible ===
Professional mourning is brought up many times throughout the Bible. For example in Amos,

''"Therefore thus says the LORD God of hosts, the Lord, "There is wailing in all the plazas, And in all the streets they say, 'Alas! Alas!' They also call the farmer to mourning And professional mourners to lamentation" (Amos 5:16).''

According to Biblical analysts, this verse is implying that lamentation is like an art. People who were deemed "good" at wailing and moaning were then able to take part in more and more funerals, and were expected to make these moaning sounds.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/geb/amos-5.html|title=Amos 5 Commentary - John Gill's Exposition on the Whole Bible|work=StudyLight.org|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people who fulfilled the roles of these professional mourners were farmers who were done cropping for their season, and didn't have much else to do, so they took on this role for the extra money it would get them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Another instance of professional mourning worth noting is in Chronicles, the Bible says

''"Then Jeremiah chanted a lament for Josiah. And all the male and female singers speak about Josiah in their lamentations to this day. And they made them an ordinance in Israel; behold, they are also written in the Lamentations." (2 Chronicles 35:25).''

When someone of power dies, in this case Josiah, everyone can fill the role of mourner, professionals aren't needed because everyone feels the weight of the loss. Everyone becomes the professional mourner.

In the book of Jeremiah,

''"Thus says the Lord of hosts, “Consider and call for the mourning women, that they may come; And send for the wailing women, that they may come! “Let them make haste and take up a wailing for us,That our eyes may shed tears and our eyelids flow with water" (Jeremiah 9: 17-18 ).''

These three quotes from the Bible are just three of many that pertain to professional mourning.

According to the book ''Mourner, Mother, Midwife'', women played an integral part when it came to mourning. "Wailing women are called to lead the people in expressions of grief in response to the national tragedy that saw the destruction of Zion. These women who are called to 'raise a dirge over us' are literally called 'wise women.' This can also be translated as 'skilled women' (Jer. 9:17 [MT16]), suggesting that the art of mourning is a skill that has to be learned. The role of the wailing woman constituted a professional trade that required training. . . . On the appropriate occasion (a funeral or a national tragedy like the one that form the backdrop of Jeremiah 9), wailing women not only had to be able to draw on the reservoir of lament handed down through the generations, but they also had to adapt these laments to suit the particular need of the current situation. . . . Their laments represent the community’s response in the face of extreme trauma."&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite news|url=http://margmowczko.com/bible-women-who-led-celebrations-and-lamentations/|title=Bible Women who Led Celebrations &amp; Lamentations {{!}} Marg Mowczko|date=2013-08-01|work=Marg Mowczko|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern Professional Mourning ==
In the eyes of the average modern professional mourner, they are performers. A common ritual in China involves the family paying the mourners in advance and bringing them in lavish style to the place the funeral will take place. The mourners are trained in the art of singing and bring a band with them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The first step is for the mourners to line up outside and crawl.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While crawling, the mourner says with anguish the name of the person.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This is symbolic of daughters running home from their families in an effort to see the body. Next, a eulogy is performed in loud, sobbing, fashion and backed up by dramatic instrumental tunes, driving the attendees to tears. One of the common lines used during these eulogies are:

''"Why did you leave us so soon? The earth is covered in a black veil for you. The rivers and streams are crying to tell your story – that of an honest man,’ Hu sings.''

''‘I shed tears for your children and grandchildren. We’re so sorry we could not keep you here,’ she croons between sobs" (Lim,2013).''

Then the family is told to bow in front of the casket three times, and suddenly a belly dancer takes the so called "stage" and the song picks up, lights start flashing, and everyone is upbeat again. Since the funeral is usually a couple of days after the actual death, the goal of the professional mourner is to remind everyone attending the funeral about the sadness and pain that is associated with when someone passes away. They also have the job of bringing the mood right back up with lighting and fun songs after the wailing and mourning is done.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In the United Kingdom, there is a program called "Rent A Mourner" in which families can hire people to increase the amount of guests at a funeral.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1994-i-am-professional-mourner-6-realities-my-job.html|title=I'm Paid To Mourn At Funerals (And It's A Growing Industry)|website=Cracked.com|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; People hired from this website are essentially actors that are given a role to play by the family, for example, a distant cousin or uncle. Mourners are expected to be able to communicate with and interact with guests without giving away that they have been hired by the family.This practice spans across religions, mourners have been hired at Muslim, Jewish, and Christian events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These mourners are paid somewhere between $30 - $120 and if everything goes well they are able to be tipped very gratuitously.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In Egypt, when someone in the family dies the women in the family would start the lamenting process, and the neighbors and the community would join throughout the day. Professional mourners would also come up and help lead the family in mourning by making grief-stricken shrieks, cherishing and reminiscing about the deceased. A funeral dirge is also performed by the mourners in which prayers are offered in the form of song or poetry.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkLQAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA665&amp;lpg=PA665&amp;dq=egyptian+professional+mourning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RaxWtdoLwz&amp;sig=yl_LKFyW7Icb-n9Suwe9yPGiwak&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifmdr41LPaAhVQ0lMKHU6BCkQ4FBDoAQgrMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=egyptian%20professional%20mourning&amp;f=false|title=A Dictionary of Religious Knowledge, for Popular and Professional Use: Comprising Full Information on Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Subjects.

A '''quality management system''' ('''QMS''') is a collection of [[business process]]es focused on consistently meeting customer requirements and enhancing their satisfaction. It is aligned with an organization's purpose and strategic direction (ISO9001:2015). It is expressed as the organizational goals and aspirations, policies, processes, documented information and resources needed to implement and maintain it. Early [[quality management]] systems emphasized predictable outcomes of an industrial product production line, using simple statistics and random sampling.  By the 20th century, labor inputs were typically the most costly inputs in most industrialized societies, so focus shifted to team cooperation and dynamics, especially the early signaling of problems via a [[continual improvement]] cycle.  In the 21st century, QMS has tended to converge with [[sustainability]] and [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] initiatives, as both investor and customer satisfaction and perceived quality is increasingly tied to these factors.  Of QMS regimes, the [[ISO 9000]] family of standards is probably the most widely implemented worldwide – the [[ISO 19011]] [[audit]] regime applies to both, and deals with quality and sustainability and their integration.

Other QMS, e.g. [[Natural Step]], focus on [[sustainability]] issues and assume that other quality problems will be reduced as result of the systematic thinking, transparency, documentation and diagnostic discipline.

The term "Quality Management System" and the acronym "QMS" were invented in 1991 by Ken Croucher, a British management consultant working on designing and implementing a generic model of a QMS within the IT industry.

==Concept of quality – historical background==
The concept of a quality as we think of it now first emerged from the [[Industrial Revolution]].. Previously goods had been made from start to finish by the same person or team of people, with handcrafting and tweaking the product to meet 'quality criteria'. Mass production brought huge teams of people together to work on specific stages of production where one person would not necessarily complete a product from start to finish. In the late 19th century pioneers such as [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] and [[Henry Ford]] recognized the limitations of the methods being used in mass production at the time and the subsequent varying quality of output. Birland established Quality Departments to oversee the quality of production and rectifying of errors, and Ford emphasized standardization of design and component standards to ensure a standard product was produced. Management of quality was the responsibility of the Quality department and was implemented by Inspection of product output to 'catch' defects.

Application of statistical control came later as a result of World War production methods, which were advanced by the work done of [[W. Edwards Deming]], a [[statistician]], after whom the [[Deming Prize]] for [[Quality (business)|quality]] is named.  [[Joseph M. Juran]] focused more on managing for quality.   The first edition of Juran's Quality Control Handbook was published in 1951.  He also developed the "Juran's trilogy", an approach to cross-functional management that is composed of three managerial processes: quality planning, quality control, and quality improvement. These functions all play a vital role when evaluating quality.

Quality, as a profession and the managerial process associated with the quality function, was introduced during the second half of the 20th century and has evolved since then. Over this period, few other disciplines have seen as many changes as the quality profession.

The quality profession grew from simple control to engineering, to systems engineering. [[Quality control]] activities were predominant in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The 1970s were an era of quality engineering and the 1990s saw quality systems as an emerging field. Like [[medicine]], [[accounting]], and [[engineering]], quality has achieved status as a recognized profession&lt;ref&gt;American Society for Quality (ASQ) Certified Quality Engineer (CQE) http://prdweb.asq.org/certification/control/quality-engineer/index&lt;/ref&gt;

As Lee and Dale (1998) state, there are many organizations that are striving to assess the methods and ways in which their overall productivity, the quality of their products and services and the required operations to achieve them are done.

==Medical devices==
The two primary , state of the art, guidelines for medical device manufacturer QMS and related services today are the [[ISO 13485]] standards and the US FDA [[21 CFR 820]] regulations. The two have a great deal of similarity, and many manufacturers adopt QMS that is compliant with both guidelines.

ISO 13485 are harmonized with the European Union [[medical devices directive]] (93/42/EEC) as well as the IVD and AIMD directives. The ISO standard is also incorporated in regulations for other jurisdictions such as Japan (JPAL) and Canada (CMDCAS).

Quality System requirements for medical devices have been internationally recognized as a way to assure product safety and efficacy and customer satisfaction since at least 1983 and were instituted as requirements in a  [http://www.gmp1st.com/md96p.pdf final rule published on October 7, 1996]. The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) had documented design defects in medical devices that contributed to recalls from 1983 to 1989 that would have been prevented if Quality Systems had been in place. The rule is promulgated at [http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/21cfr820_05.html 21 CFR 820].

According to current [[Good Manufacturing Practice]] (GMP), [[medical device]] manufacturers have the responsibility to use good judgment when developing their quality system and apply those sections of the FDA Quality System (QS) Regulation that are applicable to their specific products and operations, in [http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/21cfr820_05.html Part 820] of the QS regulation. As with GMP, operating within this flexibility, it is the responsibility of each manufacturer to establish requirements for each type or family of devices that will result in devices that are safe and effective, and to establish methods and procedures to design, produce, and distribute devices that meet the quality system requirements.

The FDA has identified in the QS regulation the 7 essential subsystems of a quality system. These subsystems include:
[[Image:Qualsystem1.png|thumb|Quality system]]
* Management controls;
* [[Design controls]];
* Production and process controls
* Corrective and preventative actions
* Material controls
* Records, documents, and change controls
* Facilities and equipment controls
all overseen by management and quality audits.

Because the QS regulation covers a broad spectrum of devices and production processes, it allows some leeway in the details of quality system elements. It is left to manufacturers to determine the necessity for, or extent of, some quality elements and to develop and implement procedures tailored to their particular processes and devices. For example, if it is impossible to mix up labels at a manufacturer because there is only one label to each product, then there is no necessity for the manufacturer to comply with all of the GMP requirements under device labeling.

Drug manufactures are regulated under a different section of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]]:

==Organizations and awards==
{{See also|List of national quality awards}}
The  [[International Organization for Standardization]]'s [[ISO 9001|ISO 9001:2015]] series describes standards for a QMS addressing the principles and processes surrounding the [[design]], [[new product development|development,]] and delivery of a general [[Product (business)|product]] or [[Service (economics)|service]]. Organizations can participate in a continuing certification process to ISO 9001:2008 to demonstrate their compliance with the standard, which includes a requirement for continual (i.e. planned) improvement of the QMS, as well as more foundational QMS components such as failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/09544780210439734 |title=The state of ISO 9000 certification: A study of Swedish organizations |year=2002 |last1=Poksinska |first1=Bozena |last2=Dahlgaard |first2=Jens Jörn |last3=Antoni |first3=Marc |journal=The TQM Magazine |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
A QMS process is an element of an organizational QMS. The [[ISO 9000|ISO9001:2000]] standard requires organizations seeking [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]] or [[certification]] to define the processes which form the QMS and the sequence and interaction of these processes. [[Butterworth-Heinemann]] and other publishers have offered several books which provide step-by-step guides to those seeking the quality certifications of their products&lt;ref name=i9sg&gt;{{cite book

Examples of such processes include:

* order processes,
* [[production plans]],
* [[product (business)|product]]/ [[service (economics)|service]]/ [[process modeling|process]] measurements to comply with specific requirements e.g. [[statistical process control]] and [[measurement systems analysis]],
* [[calibrations]],
* [[internal audits]],
* [[corrective actions]],
* [[preventive actions]],
* identification, labeling and control of [[conformance testing|non-conforming]] [[product (business)|products]] to prevent its inadvertent use, delivery or processing,
* [[purchasing]] and related processes such as [[distributor (business)|supplier]] selection and [[wikt:monitoring|monitoring]]

ISO9001 requires that the performance of these processes be measured, analyzed and [[continuous improvement|continually improved]], and the results of this form an input into the [[management]] review process.

[[File:Noyades Nantes.jpg|thumb|Painting by Joseph Aubert depicting preparations for a Republican marriage]]
[[File:Noyadesnantes.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Jean Duplessis-Bertaux]] depicting the executions at Nantes.]]
'''Republican marriage''' ({{lang-fr|'''mariage républicain'''}}) was a method of execution that allegedly occurred in [[Nantes]] during the [[Reign of Terror]] in [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]] and "involved tying a naked man and woman together and [[Drowning (execution)|drowning]] them".&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Scurr, ''Fatal Purity: Robespierre And the French Revolution'' (2006) p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; This was reported to have been practised during the [[drownings at Nantes]] (''noyades'') that were ordered by local [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] [[representative-on-mission]] [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier]] between November 1793 and January 1794 in the city of [[Nantes]]. Most accounts indicate that the victims were drowned in the [[Loire River]], although a few sources describe an alternative means of execution in which the bound couple is run through with a [[sword]], either before,&lt;ref&gt;William Stafford, ''English Feminists and Their Opponents in the 1790s: unsex'd and proper females'' (2002) p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; or instead of drowning.&lt;ref name=SB212&gt;Steven Blakemore, ''Crisis in Representation: Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, Helen Maria Williams and the Rewriting of the French Revolution'' (1997) p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest reports of such "marriages" date from 1794, when Carrier was [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier#Trial and conviction|tried for his crimes]], and they were soon cited by contemporary counter-revolutionary authors such as [[Louis-Marie Prudhomme]] and [[Louis Gabriel Ambroise de Bonald]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis-Marie Prudhomme]], '' Histoire Générale Et Impartiale Des Erreurs, Des Fautes Et Des Crimes Commis Pendant La Révolution Française, Tome III'' (1797), p. vii (referring to "Mariages républicains à Nantes. Deux personnes de différens sexes, nuds, étaient attachées ensemble, on les précipitait ensuite en masse dans la Loire" [''Republican marriages in Nantes. Two people of different sexes, nude, were attached together, then put en masse into the Loire''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The dreadful invention of the republican marriages passes the genius of man", [[Louis Gabriel Ambroise de Bonald]], '' Théorie du pouvoir politique et religieux dans la société civile'' (1796), p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of execution is attributed to French Revolutionary [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier]],&lt;ref name=AG44&gt;Archibald Alison and Edward Sherman Gould, ''History of Europe from the Commencement of the French Revolution in 1789, to the Restoration of the Bourbons in 1815'' (1850) p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; who was sent to Nantes to suppress the counterrevolutionary forces and to appoint a Revolutionary Committee. One historian described the use of the practice as follows:

:A Revolutionary Tribunal was established [at Nantes], of which Carrier was the presiding demon—Carrier, known in all nations as the inventor of that last of barbarous atrocities, the Republican Marriage, in which two persons of different genders, generally an old man and an old woman, or a young man and a young woman, bereft of every kind of clothing, were bound together before the multitude, exposed in a boat in that situation for half an hour or more, and then thrown into the river.&lt;ref name=AG44/&gt;

Details of the practice vary slightly, but are generally consistent with the description offered above. One author described how "marriages Républicains... consisted in binding together a man and woman, back to back, stripped naked, keeping them exposed for an hour, and then hurling them into the current of "la Baignoire Nationale", as the bloodhounds termed the [[Loire River|Loire]]".&lt;ref&gt;John Murray, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-AEIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=%22marriages+R%C3%A9publicains%22&amp;ei=yW69R7lnhMjIBK6ciZsF Hand-book for travellers in France] (1843), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; British radical and [[Girondist]] sympathizer [[Helen Maria Williams]], in her ''Sketch of the Politics of France, 1793–94'',&lt;ref name=hmw&gt;[[Helen Maria Williams]], ''Sketch of the Politics of France, 1793–94'' (1795), p. 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that "innocent young women were unclothed in the presence of the monsters; and, to add a deeper horror to this infernal act of cruelty, were tied to young men, and both were cut down with sabers, or thrown into the river; and this kind of murder was called a republican marriage".&lt;ref name=hmw/&gt;

== Skepticism ==
While the executions of men, women and children by drowning in Nantes is not generally disputed, the factual nature of the "republican marriages," in particular, has been doubted by several historians who alleged it to be a legend.&lt;ref name="Bertrand, Ernest 1868. p. 7-92"&gt;Bertrand, Ernest. 1868. La justice révolutionnaire en France du 17 août 1792 au 12 prairial an III (31 mai 1793), 17:e article, Annuaire de la Société philotechnique, 1868, tome 30, p. 7-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alain Gérard 1993 p.265-266"&gt;Alain Gérard (1993). La Vendée: 1789–1793. p.265-266&lt;/ref&gt;. The claim that such a manner of execution has been practiced and ordered by Carrier appears for the first time in the trial of the members of the Revolutionary Committee of Nantes by the Revolutionary Tribunal in 1794. It was present in the report of Charles-Gilbert Romme and in several letters and witness testimonies. However, while a few witnesses asserted that they had heard about "republican marriages", none had actually seen one; one cited a drunken boatman who had used the term "civic marriage" but hadn't suggested that the executed were paired according to sex.&lt;ref&gt;Title unknown, ''[[L'intermediaire des chercheurs et curieux]]'', 1866. P.244&lt;/ref&gt; As both the assistant-prosecutor and the defence mentioned, there was not enough evidence for that particular accusation, and it was crossed out from the indictment by the president of the jury. The remaining facts were entirely sufficient for Carrier and several of his closest accomplices to be sentenced to death. The reports of "republican marriages" nevertheless became well-known and were later cited by many authors writing about the Terror, who would elaborate on them, for example by adding the claim that the two victims were a priest and a [[nun]].&lt;ref name="Bertrand, Ernest 1868. p. 7-92"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alain Gérard 1993 p.265-266"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brégeon, Jean-Joël. 1987. Carrier et la Terreur nantaise, p.169-171&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==
The use of the term appears to be a mockery of the concept of "republican marriage" as an actual "[[secularism|secular]]" marriage. Books describe parents horrified to learn that their children planned a "republican marriage" instead of being married in a church.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Sartain]], et al., ''Friendship's Offering'' (1854), p. 271: "No priest dare marry us, dearest, and I cannot respect a republican marriage!"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Laure Junot, duchess d'Abrantès|Laure Junot Abrantès]], ''Memoirs of the Duchess D'Abrantès (Madame Junot)'' (1832) p. 294: [asked whether her daughter would be married in a church] "How could you for a moment entertain the idea that not my daughter only, but myself and her brother, could consent to a purely republican marriage?"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Brockden Brown]], ''The Literary Magazine, and American Register'' (1804), p. 73:  "There are many persons here, who are not content with a republican marriage, but get themselves also privately married by a priest, according to the forms of the Catholic religion".&lt;/ref&gt; As one source describes the institution:

:At the time [[Napoleon]] and [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Josephine]] were married (in March 1796), "few people considered the religious ceremony at all necessary: people got married with so much facility, and in so simple a manner, that the exaggeration is merely verbal which states that the republican marriage ceremony was completed by dancing round a [[arbre de la liberté|tree of liberty]], and that the divorce was effected by dancing round the same tree of liberty backwards".&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles MacFarlane]], ''The French Revolution'', Vol. III (1845), p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salt''' (c. 1900-1952) and '''Sauce''' (c. 1900-1960) were once two of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s most famous and notorious performing [[elephant]]s (various sources including "The English Circus and Fair Ground" by Sir Garrard Tywhitt-Drake).

==Career ==

Salt and Sauce were owned and presented by some of the most famous show business people of their era. Their owners included [[Carl Hagenbeck]], [[George William Lockhart]], Herbet "Captain Joe" Taylor, John "Broncho Bill" Swallow, [[Dudley Zoo]], Tom Fossett, Dennis Fossett, Harry Coady and [[Billy Butlin]]. Their presenters included Ivor Rosaire and Emily Paulo. Formerly members and believed to be the longest suriviving members of [[George William Lockhart]]'s "Cruet", they were featured in various books, newspapers and magazines in their day, and are the focus of a new book "The Legend of Salt and Sauce". The elephants were famed for their vast array of tricks, but also feared for their temperamental moods. Sauce (known as "Saucy" most of the time) killed George William Lockhart (her owner and trainer) in an accident at Walthamstow Station and Salt killed William Aslett (an elephant groom) when she attacked him in 1957 on Rosaire's [[Circus]].

== Deaths ==

Despite both Salt suffering [[dropsy]] symptoms that had already killed two other members of "The Cruet" she went on to live for five decades. Her death was well documented in the Cambridge local press (source: The Legend of Salt and Sauce) when she accidentally got stuck in Vauxhall lake whilst touring with Ringland's Circus in 1952. After seven hours and with the aid of a crane she was freed from the lake, but suffered from [[pneumonia]] and died after a week. According to the local press over a hundred wreaths were left for her at the circus. It was predicted that her lifelong companion, Sauce, would die soon afterwards (source: Salt and Sauce were Separated by John D. Swallow), but she lived until 1960, dying from "natural causes".

== Media featuring Salt and Sauce ==

Salt and Sauce were booked on numerous famous British circuses (source: "World's Fair", "King Pole" magazine, various programmes, "The Victorian Arena" by John Turner and "The Legend of Salt and Sauce" by Jamie Clubb). Confirmed buildings they worked in included The Lyceum, Norwich Hippodrome, [[Blackpool Tower]], Great Yarmouth Hippodrome and [[World's Fair]] Islington. Circuses included [[Tom Sylvester]]'s, [[Bertram Mills]]' Circus, [[Billy Smart, Sr.]]'s Circus, [[Broncho Bill's Circus]], [[Rosaire's Circus]], [[Paulo's Circus]], [[Ringland's Circus]] and [[Cody's Circus]] (Sauce only) among many others. 
   
According to an article written in the "World's Fair" newspaper, the two elephants were also featured in the film [[Elephant Boy (film)|Elephant Boy]].

== Books featuring Salt and Sauce ==
*''Grey Titan: The Book of Elephants'', W. Bosworth and G. Lockhart, 1938 
*''The English Circus and Fair Ground'', Sir Garrard Tyrwhitt-Drake, 1946
*''The English Circus'', [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]], 1952

== Biography==
Born to actor and musician [[Katsuhiko Nakagawa]], a celebrity in Japan in the 1980s, she was raised by her mother in [[Nakano, Tokyo|Nakano]] (Katsuhiko Nakagawa died in 1994). In the 2006 book {{nihongo4|Shokotan Manual|しょこ☆まにゅ|Shoko Manyu}}, she wrote that her legal name was {{nihongo4|Shiyōko|しようこ}} rather than {{nihongo4|Shōko|しょうこ}}, which she had been using for most of her life. At the time of her birth, she and her mother had to remain in the hospital, and her maternal aunt was left with registering her in the ''[[koseki]]''. When her mother's intended name of {{nihongo4|"Shōko"|薔子}} was declined due to {{nihongo2|薔}} being forbidden due to Japanese law, the aunt wrote the name down in hiragana and recorded her name with a large ''[[yo (kana)|yo]]'' rather than its smaller combining form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ja:しょこ☆まにゅ|trans-title=Shokotan Manual|title=Shoko Manyu|date=December 1, 2006|publisher=Gakken|location=Japan|language=Japanese|isbn=978-4054031999}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her entertainment debut in 2001, winning the Grand Prix award at the Popolo Girl Audition&lt;ref name="Otaku encyclopedia entry"&gt;{{cite book|last=Galbraith|first=Patrick W.|title=The Otaku Encyclopedia: An Insider's Guide to the Subculture of Cool Japan |publisher=Kodansha International|year=2009|page=206|isbn=978-4-7700-3101-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and representing the [[Jackie Chan]] talent agency.

'''Stephanus Parmenius''' ({{lang-hu|Budai Parmenius István}}; c. 1555 – 29 August 1583) was a Hungarian scholar and Humanist poet who traveled to Oxford and became involved in the English exploration of the New World.  He joined [[Humphrey Gilbert]]'s expedition to North America with the intention of writing a chronicle of the voyage and its discoveries. Parmenius reached Newfoundland, likely becoming the first Hungarian in the New World. However, he died on the return voyage in 1583 when his ship was lost at sea.

==Biography==
Parmenius was probably born sometime between 1555 and 1560 in [[Buda]] which had been under Ottoman rule [[Siege of Buda (1541)|since 1541]]. His parents are not known, but he was raised as a Protestant, possibly a Calvinist, and received a privileged classical education in Hungary. In 1579 he was sent on a tour of European universities to complete his education. He went first to Heidelberg University and studied there for two years.&lt;ref name="Gomori"&gt;Gomori (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1581 he traveled to England where he came under the patronage of [[Henry Unton]]. He settled in Oxford where he befriended the president of Magdalen College, [[Laurence Humfrey]] and lodged with [[Richard Hakluyt]] at Christ Church. In 1582 he wrote his first Latin poem, ''Paean'' or "Thanksgiving Hymn", dedicated to Unton and printed by [[Thomas Vautrollier]].&lt;ref name="Quinn72"&gt;Quinn (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time Hakluyt was working closely with [[Humphrey Gilbert]] to plan a voyage of exploration and settlement in North America. Hakluyt introduced Parmenius to Gilbert who must have been favorably impressed with the young Hungarian. Parmenius was excited by the proposed expedition and wrote another long Latin poem, ''De Navigatione'' which honored English explorers and hailed Gilbert's plans to found a colony in the New World.&lt;ref name="Gomori"&gt;Gomori (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert arranged to have the poem published and paid part of the printing costs.&lt;ref name="Quinn72"&gt;Quinn (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

As preparations for Gilbert's voyage proceeded, Parmenius took the opportunity to join the expedition and serve as chronicler of the enterprise. On 11 June 1583 they set sail from Plymouth with a fleet of five ships. Parmenius was aboard the ''Swallow'', a small frigate that had been engaged in piracy and was subsequently seized by Gilbert and pressed into his service.&lt;ref name="Quinn72"&gt;Quinn (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

The outward voyage took longer than expected and supplies ran low. Finally, the ships reached landfall at St. John’s harbor, Newfoundland, on 3 August 1583. They were not the first Europeans to reach the site—the harbor was a seasonal camp for the fishing vessels from England, Portugal, France and Spain. The expedition remained there for a couple weeks, levying supplies from the fishing camp and exploring the countryside. Parmenius was not overly impressed with his first experience in the New World. In a letter to Hakluyt, he wrote of the impenetrable pine forests, the weather, and his disappointment at not meeting any native peoples. He expressed the hope that the country would improve as they traveled further south along the coast.&lt;ref name="Quinn79"&gt;Quinn (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 20 they set sail again with plans to explore further south. Parmenius switched ships and joined the crew on the ''[[HMS Delight (1583)|Delight]]''. On August 29 his ship encountered shallow waters, went aground and quickly broke up in bad weather off the coast of [[Sable Island]]. Some crew members survived but Parmenius was drowned.&lt;ref name="Quinn79"&gt;Quinn (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

A companion who survived, Edward Hayes, paid tribute to Parmenius with these words: "Amongst whom was drowned a learned man, an Hungarian, borne in the citie of Buda, called thereof Budaeus, who of pietie and zeale to good attempts, adventured in this action, minding to record in the Latin tongue, the gests and things of our nation, the same being adorned with the eloquent stile of this Orator, and rare Poet of our time."&lt;ref&gt;Basa (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The one surviving letter from Parmenius was included by Hakluyt in the second edition of ''The Principal Navigations'' (1600).&lt;ref name="Gomori"&gt;Gomori (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7780">'''Symbolic regression''' is a type of [[regression analysis]] that searches the space of mathematical expressions to find the model that best fits a given dataset, both in terms of accuracy and simplicity. No particular model is provided as a starting point to the algorithm. Instead, initial expressions are formed by randomly combining mathematical building blocks such as [[Operation (mathematics)|mathematical operators]], [[analytic function]]s, [[Constant (mathematics)|constants]], and [[state variable]]s. (Usually, a subset of these primitives will be specified by the person operating it, but that's not a requirement of the technique.) New equations are then formed by recombining previous equations, using [[genetic programming]].

By not requiring a specific model to be specified, symbolic regression isn't affected by human bias, or unknown gaps in [[domain knowledge]]. It attempts to uncover the intrinsic relationships of the dataset, by letting the patterns in the data itself reveal the appropriate models, rather than imposing a model structure that is deemed mathematically tractable from a human perspective. The [[fitness function]] that drives the evolution of the models takes into account not only [[Residual (numerical analysis)|error metrics]] (to ensure the models accurately predict the data), but also special complexity measures,&lt;ref name="complexity"/&gt; thus ensuring that the resulting models reveal the data's underlying structure in a way that's understandable from a human perspective. This facilitates reasoning and favors the odds of getting insights about the data-generating system.

== Difference from classical regression ==

While conventional regression techniques seek to optimize the parameters for a pre-specified model structure, symbolic regression avoids imposing prior assumptions, and instead infers the model from the data. In other words, it attempts to discover both model structures and model parameters.

This approach has, of course, the disadvantage of having a much larger space to search — in fact, not only the search space in symbolic regression is infinite, but there are an infinite number of models which will perfectly fit a finite data set (provided that the model complexity isn't artificially limited). This means that it will possibly take a symbolic regression algorithm much longer to find an appropriate model and parametrization, than traditional regression techniques. This can be attenuated by limiting the set of building blocks provided to the algorithm, based on existing knowledge of the system that produced the data; but in the end, using symbolic regression is a decision that has to be balanced with how much is known about the underlying system.

Nevertheless, this characteristic of symbolic regression also has advantages: because the [[evolutionary algorithm]] requires diversity in order to effectively explore the search space, the end result is likely to be a selection of high-scoring models (and their corresponding set of parameters). Examining this collection could provide better insight into the underlying process, and allows the user to identify an approximation that better fits their needs in terms of accuracy and simplicity.

== Career ==
Teodoro Escanilla was a well known human rights leader in the Sorsogon province. He was the spokesperson for the human rights group [[Karapatan]], Sorsogon.&lt;ref name=philstar2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=filipinotimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filipinotimes.ae/news/2015/08/23/another-filipino-journalist-killed-in-a-week/|title=Another Filipino journalist killed in a week|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415001206/http://filipinotimes.ae/news/2015/08/23/another-filipino-journalist-killed-in-a-week/|archivedate=2016-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a chairmen of the local Anakpawis political party, which is a party affiliated with the [[Kilusang Mayo Uno]] union that advocates labor issues on behalf of peasants and workers.&lt;ref name=philstar2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=filipinotimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=cmfrphil /&gt;

In addition, Tio Todoy was a block timer for Radio dzMS in Sorsogon City for about 10 years before his death.

== Death ==
Around six men on three motorcycles arrived at Teodoro Escanilla's family compound in the Tadon village, Barcelona town, Sorsogon province shortly before midnight on Wednesday, 19 August, 2015 as Escanilla and his wife were entertaining a guest.&lt;ref name=philstar2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=cpj /&gt;&lt;ref name=bicol /&gt; He went to see what the men wanted and they shot him eight times.

== Context ==
[[Reporters Without Borders]] ranked the Philippines 141 out of 180 for press freedom and among the most dangerous countries for journalists in 2015.&lt;ref name=themanilastandardtoday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/news/-main-stories/top-stories/195670/ph-still-among-hot-spots-for-journalists.html|title=PH still among hot spots for journalists|work=The Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 40 other radio "block timers," or radio hosts who buy time from radio stations, had been killed since 2002 by the time Escanilla was murdered.&lt;ref name=cmfrphil /&gt; News organizations noted that his murder followed by one day the murder of Gregorio “Loloy” Ybañez, publisher of Kabuhayan News Services.&lt;ref name=philstar2 /&gt; Beside Ybañez and Escanilla, other journalists killed in 2015 include Cosme Maestrado, August 27, and Jose Bernardo, October 31.&lt;ref name=seapa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seapa.org/the-ampatuan-massacre-trial-still-moving-slowly/|title=The Ampatuan massacre trial: Still moving slowly - SEAPA – Southeast Asian Press Alliance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact == 
Escanilla was actively involved in radio commentary and human rights, political activity that was critical of the military's anti-insurgency campaign in the Bicol area.&lt;ref name=bicol /&gt;&lt;ref name=pbnbicol /&gt;&lt;ref name=bicol/&gt;&lt;ref name=bicoltoday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bicoltoday.com/2015/08/24/nujp-condemns-killing-of-human-rights-journalist/|title=NUJP condemns killing of human rights journalist|work=BICOL TODAY}}&lt;/ref&gt; It possible that these attacks were the result of the state's military counter-insurgency campaign as documented by Karapatan.&lt;ref name=bicol /&gt;

== Reactions ==
A spokesperson for the Malacañang Press Corps issued the statement, "We condemn the killing of Teodoro Escanilla. The authorities will go after the suspects and will bring them to face justice."&lt;ref name=filipinotimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=manilastandardtoday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/news/-main-stories/top-stories/185200/media-slays-assailed.html|title=Media slays assailed|work=The Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sorsogon chapter of the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines said, "We ... call on the authorities to get to the bottom of this latest incident which threatens to once again plunge the province into chaos and bring back the dark years of retaliatory killings which have caused the death of several human rights advocates and state agents."&lt;ref name=bicoltoday /&gt;

The human rights and political community also had strong reactions to his death:

"Many more Ka Tudoys will spring forth from the ranks of the oppressed masses despite of his killing," said Escanilla's colleague from the human rights organization Karapatan.&lt;ref name=bicol /&gt;

Karapatan released the following statement: "We also call on all people to condemn in the strongest term possible this senseless and cold-blooded killing which has no place in a society if it calls itself civilized and democratic... The perpetrators of this killing are as bestial and demonic as their deed which could only be found in military camps and garrisons of a police and Hitlerian state that has no regard to the sanctity of life and respect for the human rights of the people."&lt;ref name=pbnbicol /&gt;

'''''The Continence of Scipio''''' ({{lang-nl|De grootmoedigheid van Scipio}}) is a circa 1653 painting by Dutch artist [[Gerbrand van den Eeckhout]]. It shows [[The Continence of Scipio|the continence of Scipio]] and is now in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam.

==Description==
The painting shows the moment when Scipio informs the groom that he can have his bride, as well as the riches that the bride's parents have just paid in ransom. Of the riches displayed, the [[Memorial Guild Cup (Adam van Vianen)|ewer of the Amsterdam silversmith's guild]], a famous silver object by [[Adam van Vianen]], is also in the Rijksmuseum collection. Van den Eeckhout made another version of the same subject, that also features the ewer (lying on its side), which is now in the collection of the [[Toledo Museum of Art]]:

This painting is one of several paintings in the collection of art dealer D. Katz that were taken to the Führer museum in Linz. After WWII it was returned with other Nazi looted art to the Netherlands and has been on loan to the Rijksmuseum since. In 1966 it was noticed by the silver curator of art in the museum, Theresia M. Duyvené de Wit Klinkhamer, who included it in her overview of paintings that show the Adam van Vianen ewer.&lt;ref&gt;Th.M.

'''Utopian socialism''' is a label used to define the first currents of modern [[Socialism|socialist]] thought as exemplified by the work of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Étienne Cabet]] and [[Robert Owen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/synopsis.html|title=Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism|publisher=Public Broadcasting System|accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utopian socialism is often described as the presentation of visions and outlines for imaginary or futuristic ideal societies, with positive ideals being the main reason for moving society in such a direction. Later socialists and critics of utopian socialism viewed "utopian socialism" as not being grounded in actual material conditions of existing society and in some cases as reactionary. These visions of ideal societies competed with [[Marxist]]-inspired revolutionary social democratic movements.&lt;ref name="Draper"&gt;{{cite book|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution, Volume IV: Critique of Other Socialisms|year=1990|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=0853457980|pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often applied to those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label "utopian" by later socialists as a [[pejorative]] in order to imply ''naiveté'' and to dismiss their ideas as fanciful and unrealistic.&lt;ref name="SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction"&gt;''Newman, Michael''. (2005) ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar school of thought that emerged in the early 20th century is [[ethical socialism]], which makes the case for socialism on moral grounds.

However, one key difference between utopian socialists and other socialists (including most [[anarchists]]) is that utopian socialists generally do not believe any form of class struggle or political revolution is necessary for socialism to emerge. Utopians believe that people of all classes can voluntarily adopt their plan for society if it is presented convincingly.&lt;ref name="Draper"/&gt; They feel their form of cooperative socialism can be established among like-minded people within the existing society and that their small communities can demonstrate the feasibility of their plan for society.&lt;ref name="Draper"/&gt;

== Definition ==
{{see also|Utopia}}
The thinkers identified as utopian socialist did not use the term "utopian" to refer to their ideas. [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were the first thinkers to refer to them as "utopian", referring to all socialist ideas that simply presented a vision and distant goal of an ethically just society as utopian. This utopian mindset which held an integrated conception of the goal, the means to produce said goal and an understanding of the way that those means would inevitably be produced through examining social and economic phenomena can be contrasted with [[scientific socialism]], which has been likened to [[Taylorism]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

This distinction was made clear in Engels' work ''[[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]'' (1892, part of an earlier publication, the ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' from 1878). Utopian socialists were seen as wanting to expand the principles of the French revolution in order to create a more "rational" society. Despite being labeled as utopian by later socialists, their aims were not always utopian and their values often included rigid support for the scientific method and the creation of a society based upon scientific understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm|title=Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (Chpt. 1)|author=Frederick Engels|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The term "utopian socialism" was introduced by Karl Marx in "For a Ruthless Criticism of Everything" in 1843 (and then developed in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' in 1848), although shortly before its publication Marx had already attacked the ideas of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in ''[[The poverty of philosophy|Das Elend der Philosophie]]'' (originally written in French, 1847). The term was used by later socialist thinkers to describe early socialist or quasi-socialist intellectuals who created hypothetical visions of [[egalitarian]], [[communalist]], [[meritocratic]], or other notions of "perfect" societies without considering how these societies could be created or sustained.

In ''Das Elend der Philosophie'', English title ''The Poverty of Philosophy'', Marx criticized the [[Economics|economic]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] arguments of Proudhon set forth in ''[[The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty]]''. Marx accused Proudhon of wanting to rise above the [[bourgeoisie]]. In the history of Marx's thought and [[Marxism]], this work is pivotal in the distinction between the concepts of utopian socialism and what Marx and the Marxists claimed as scientific socialism.

Although utopian socialists shared few political, social, or economic perspectives, Marx and Engels argued that they shared certain intellectual characteristics. In ''The Communist Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Friedrich and Marx, Karl Heinrich. »Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei«. Edited by Sálvio M. Soares. MetaLibri, October 31, 2008, v1.0s.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx and Engels wrote: "The undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their own surroundings, causes Socialists of this kind to consider themselves far superior to all class antagonisms. They want to improve the condition of every member of society, even that of the most favored. Hence, they habitually appeal to society at large, without distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the ruling class. For how can people, when once they understand their system, fail to see it in the best possible plan of the best possible state of society? Hence, they reject all political, and especially all revolutionary, action; they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means, and endeavor, by small experiments, necessarily doomed to failure, and by the force of example, to pave the way for the new social Gospel".

Marx and Engels used the term "scientific socialism" to describe the type of socialism they saw themselves developing. According to Engels, socialism was not "an accidental discovery of this or that ingenious brain, but the necessary outcome of the struggle between two historically developed classes{{spaced ndash}}the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Its task was no longer to manufacture a system of society as perfect as possible, but to examine the historical-economic succession of events from which these classes and their antagonism had of necessity sprung, and to discover in the economic conditions thus created the means of ending the conflict".

Critics have argued that utopian socialists who established experimental communities were in fact trying to apply the [[scientific method]] to human social organization and were therefore not utopian. For instance, [[Joshua Muravchik]] on the basis of [[Karl Popper]]'s definition of science as "the practice of experimentation, of hypothesis and test" argued that "Owen and Fourier and their followers were the real ‘scientific socialists.’ They hit upon the idea of socialism, and they tested it by attempting to form socialist communities". Muravchik further argued that in contrast Marx made untestable predictions about the future and that Marx's view that socialism would be created by impersonal historical forces may lead one to conclude that it is unnecessary to strive for socialism because it will happen anyway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/publication/the-rise-and-fall-of-socialism/ The Rise and Fall of Socialism] Joshua Muravchik SPEECHES AEI Bradley Lecture Series Publication Date: February 8, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-19th century, [[Marxism]] and [[Marxism–Leninism]] overtook utopian socialism in terms of intellectual development and number of adherents. At one time almost half the population of the world lived under regimes that claimed to be Marxist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/marx.html|author=Steven Kreis|title=Karl Marx, 1818-1883|publisher=The History Guide|date=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currents like [[Saint-Simonianism]] and [[Fourierism]] attracted the interest of numerous later authors but failed to compete with the now dominant Marxist, Proudhonist, or Leninist schools on a political level. It has been noted that they exerted a significant influence on the emergence of new religious movements such as [[spiritualism]] and [[occult]]ism.&lt;ref&gt;Strube, Julian (2016). "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1146926 Socialist Religion and the Emergence of Occultism: A Genealogical Approach to Socialism and Secularization in 19th-Century France]."

''Aries'' 16/1, pp. 13–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature and in practice ==
Perhaps the first utopian socialist was [[Thomas More]] (1478–1535), who wrote about an imaginary socialist society in his book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published in 1516. The contemporary definition of the English word "utopia" derives from this work and many aspects of More's description of Utopia were influenced by life in [[monasteries]].&lt;ref name="Davis1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. C. Davis|title=Utopia and the Ideal Society: A Study of English Utopian Writing 1516-1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5T-LVB-6tIC&amp;pg=PA58|date=28 July 1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-27551-4|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Robert Owen.png|thumb|[[Robert Owen]] was one of the founders of utopian socialism]]
[[File:Ehrerbietige Vorstellung und Einladung an meine lieben Mitmenschen.pdf|thumb|Utopian socialist pamphlet of Swiss social medical doctor [[Rudolf Sutermeister]] (1802–1868)]]
[[Saint-Simonianism]] was a [[France|French]] political and social movement of the first half of the 19th century, inspired by the ideas of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon]] (1760–1825). His ideas influenced [[Auguste Comte]] (who was, for a time, Saint-Simon's secretary), [[Karl Marx]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and many other thinkers and social theorists.

[[Robert Owen]] (1771–1858) was a successful Welsh businessman who devoted much of his profits to improving the lives of his employees. His reputation grew when he set up a textile factory in [[New Lanark]], [[Scotland]], co-funded by his teacher, the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] [[Jeremy Bentham]] and introduced shorter working hours, schools for children and renovated housing. He wrote about his ideas in his book ''A New View of Society'' which was published in 1813 and ''An Explanation of the Cause of Distress which pervades the civilized parts of the world'' in 1823. He also set up an [[Owenite]] commune called [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] in [[Indiana]]. This collapsed when one of his business partners ran off with all the profits. Owen's main contribution to socialist thought was the view that human social behavior is not fixed or absolute and that humans have the free will to organize themselves into any kind of society they wished.

[[Charles Fourier]] (1772–1837) rejected the [[industrial revolution]] altogether and thus the problems that arose with it, Fourier made various fanciful claims about the ideal world he envisioned. Despite some clearly non-socialist inclinations,{{Clarify|date=November 2010}} he contributed significantly even if indirectly to the socialist movement. His writings about turning work into play influenced the young Karl Marx and helped him devise his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]]. Also a contributor to [[feminism]], Fourier invented the concept of ''[[phalanstère]]'', units of people based on a theory of passions and of their combination. Several colonies based on Fourier's ideas were founded in the United States by [[Albert Brisbane]] and [[Horace Greeley]].

[[Étienne Cabet]] (1788–1856), influenced by Robert Owen, published a book in 1840 entitled ''Travel and adventures of Lord William Carisdall in Icaria'' in which he described an ideal [[communalist]] society. His attempts to form real socialist communities based on his ideas through the [[Icarians|Icarian movement]] did not survive, but one such community was the precursor of [[Corning, Iowa]]. Possibly inspired by [[Christianity]], he coined the word "communism" and influenced other thinkers, including Marx and Engels.

[[Edward Bellamy]] (1850–1898) published ''[[Looking Backward]]'' in 1888, a utopian romance novel about a future socialist society. In Bellamy's utopia, property was held in common and money replaced with a system of equal credit for all. Valid for a year and non-transferable between individuals, credit expenditure was to be tracked via "credit-cards" (which bear no resemblance to modern credit cards which are tools of debt-finance). Labour was compulsory from age 21 to 40 and organised via various departments of an Industrial Army to which most citizens belonged. Working hours were to be cut drastically due to technological advances (including organisational). People were expected to be motivated by a Religion of Solidarity and criminal behavior was treated as a form of mental illness or "atavism". The book ranked as second or third best seller of its time (after ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and ''Ben Hur''). In 1897, Bellamy published a sequel entitled ''Equality'' as a reply to his critics and which lacked the Industrial Army and other authoritarian aspects.

[[William Morris]] (1834–1896) published ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' in 1890, partly as a response to Bellamy's ''Looking Backwards'', which he equated with the socialism of Fabians such as Sydney Webb. Morris' vision of the future socialist society was centred around his concept of useful work as opposed to useless toil and the redemption of human labour. Morris believed that all work should be artistic, in the sense that the worker should find it both pleasurable and an outlet for creativity. Morris' conception of labour thus bears strong resemblance to Fourier's, while Bellamy's (the reduction of labour) is more akin to that of Saint-Simon or in aspects Marx.

The [[Brotherhood Church]] in Britain and the [[Life and Labor Commune]] in Russia were based on the [[Christian anarchist]] ideas of [[Leo Tolstoy]] (1828–1910).

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) and [[Peter Kropotkin]] (1842–1921) wrote about anarchist forms of socialism in their books. Proudhon wrote ''[[What is Property?]]'' (1840) and ''[[The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty]]'' (1847). Kropotkin wrote ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' (1892) and ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]]'' (1912). Many of the anarchist collectives formed in [[Spain]], especially in [[Aragon]] and [[Catalonia]], during the [[Spanish Civil War]] were based on their ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sam Dolgoff|authorlink=Sam Dolgoff|title=[[The Anarchist Collectives: Workers' Self-Management in the Spanish Revolution, 1936–1939]]|publisher=Black Rose Books|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many participants in the historical [[kibbutz]] movement in [[Israel]] were motivated by utopian socialist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=From utopia to total institution in a single generation: the kibbutz and Bruderhof|author=Sheldon Goldenberg and Gerda R. Wekerle|journal=International Review of Modern Sociology|volume=2|issue=2|date=September 1972|pages=224–232|jstor=41420450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustin Souchy]] (1892–1984) spent most of his life investigating and participating in many kinds of socialist communities. Souchy wrote about his experiences in his autobiography ''Beware! Anarchist!''.

[[Behavioral psychologist]] [[B.F. Skinner]] (1904–1990) published ''[[Walden Two]]'' in 1948. The [[Twin Oaks Community]] was originally based on his ideas.

[[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (born 1929) wrote about an impoverished anarchist society in her book ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' published in 1974 and in which the anarchists agree to leave their home planet and colonize a barely habitable moon in order to avoid a bloody revolution.

== Related concepts ==
Some communities of the modern [[intentional community]] movement, such as [[kibbutzim]], could be categorized as utopian socialist.

For example, religious sects whose members live communally such as the [[Hutterites]] or [[Bruderhof Communities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://christlife.org/blog/learning-from-the-bruderhof-an-intentional-christian-community|title=Learning from the Bruderhof: An Intentional Christian Community|work=ChristLife|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not usually called "utopian socialists", although their way of living is a prime example. They have been categorized as [[religious socialism|religious socialists]] by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1VwVSDBleUC&amp;pg=PA61|title=America's Economic Moralists: A History of Rival Ethics and Economics|author=Donald E. Frey|publisher=SUNY Press|date=2009|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classless modes of production in [[hunter-gatherer]] societies are referred to as "[[primitive communism]]" by Marxists to stress their classless nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialistworker.co.uk/art/33429/Primitive+communism%3A+life+before+class+and+oppression|title=Primitive communism: life before class and oppression|publisher=Socialist Worker|date=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related concept is that of a socialist utopia, usually depicted in works of fiction as possible ways society can turn out to be in the future and often combined with notions of a technologically revolutionized economy.

The '''value of control''' is a quantitative measure of the value of controlling the outcome of an [[random variable|uncertain variable]]. [[Decision analysis]] provides a means for calculating the value of both '''perfect''' and '''imperfect control'''. The former value, informally known as the '''value of wizardry''', is an upper bound for the latter. Obtaining meaningful value-of-control measurements requires an awareness of important restrictions (concerning the nature of [[free will]] and the meaning of [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] statements) on the validity of this kind of analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8938">The '''War Resisters League''' (WRL) is the oldest secular [[pacifist]] organization in the United States.&lt;ref name="forusa.org"&gt;[http://forusa.org/groups/affiliate-groups/war-resisters-league "War Resisters League" Fellowship for Reconciliation website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warresisters.org/history |title=WRL History |publisher=Warresisters.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Founded in 1923 by men and women who had [[opposed World War I]], it is a section of the London-based [[War Resisters' International]].&lt;ref name="S2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Powers S|title=Protest, Power, and Change: An Encyclopedia of Nonviolent Action|year= 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-76482-0 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xmlWr4aAt4EC&amp;pg=PA563 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be one of the leading radical voices in the anti-war movement.&lt;ref name="forusa.org"/&gt;

Many of the organization's founders had been jailed during [[World War I]] for refusing [[conscription in the United States|military service]].  From the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] many [[Jew]]s, [[suffragist]]s, [[socialist]]s, and [[anarchists]] separated to form this more [[secular]] organization.

Although the WRL was opposed to US participation in [[World War II]], it did not protest against it; the WRL complied with the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]], ceased public protests, and did not solicit new members during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], many members were imprisoned as conscientious objectors.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, p. 69ff&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, WRL members worked in the [[civil rights movement]] and organized protests against [[nuclear weapon]]s testing and [[United States civil defense|civil defense]] drills.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In the 1960s, WRL was the first [[pacifist]] organization to call for an end to the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; WRL also organized the first demonstration against the war with a September 21, 1963 vigil at the U.S. Mission to the UN, followed by an October 9, 1963 picket of [[Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu]] speaking at the [[Waldorf-Astoria in New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;''WRL News'', Nov-Dec 1963, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; WRL was among the primary groups (along with [[Committee for Nonviolent Action]], the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]], the [[Socialist Party]], and the [[Student Peace Union]]) to organize coordinated nationwide protests against the Vietnam War on December 19, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;''The Power of the People'', ed. Robert Cooney &amp; Helen Michalowski, [[New Society Publishers]], Philadelphia, PA, 1987, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's opposition to nuclear weapons was extended to include [[nuclear power]] in the 1970s and 1980s. The WRL has also been active in [[feminism|feminist]] and anti-[[racism|racist]] causes and works with other organizations to reduce the level of violence in modern culture.

==Current activities==
Presently, the War Resisters League is actively organizing against the wars in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] as well as the impact of war at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barry |first=Dan |title=A nation at war: at war at home; as wars come and go, Ralph keeps protesting |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6D91F31F931A15750C0A9659C8B63&amp;&amp;scp=9&amp;sq=%22War%20Resisters%20League%22&amp;st=cse |journal=New York Times |year=2003 |issue=March 22 |accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of its organizing is focused on challenging military recruiters and ending corporate profit from war. It publishes an annual peace calendar, the quarterly magazine ''WIN: Through Revolutionary Nonviolence'', and other materials and is involved in a number of national peace and justice coalitions, including [[United for Peace and Justice]] and the [[National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee]]. Since 1958, WRL has awarded almost annually the [[War Resisters League Peace Award]] to a person or organization whose work represents the League's radical nonviolent program of action.

The War Resisters League annually publishes a pie chart showing how much of the [[US Budget|U.S. federal budget]] actually covers current and past [[Military budget of the United States|military expenses]], listing the total as 54%:
:"The figures are federal funds, which do not include trust funds — such as Social Security — that are raised and spent separately from income taxes....The government practice of [[Unified budget|combining trust and federal funds]] began during the [[Vietnam War]], thus making the human needs portion of the budget seem larger and the military portion smaller. "&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warresisters.org/pages/piechart.htm Pie chart], warresisters.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/sardi/sardi59.html|title=How Much Does It Cost Your Household for War?|last=Sardi|first=Bill |work=lewrockwell.com|accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These figures are at odds with official government figures:  
:"[Dov S. Zakheim, the Pentagon comptroller pointed] out that the 2004 military budget would represent 16.6 percent of all federal spending, compared with 27.3 percent in the late 1980's."&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, Leslie. [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/04/us/president-s-budget-proposal-military-despite-bush-s-vow-spending-high-tech.html?scp=1&amp;sq=federal+budget+military+spending&amp;st=nyt THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE MILITARY; Despite Bush's Vow, Spending on High-Tech Weapons Remains at Low Level], [[New York Times]]. (February 4, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

:"...War Resisters....count moneys appropriated for veterans' benefits and payment of the national debt as "taxes to support past wars." The group does this because the only way it can arrive at the figure of 47 percent of the federal budget going to the military is to count what they see as past military spending."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frontpagemag.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID=B65F7E43-50D4-409D-9162-2BC1CEA92E94 |title=No Taxes for Freedom!|last=Jennings|first=Daniel G. |date=May 2, 2003 |publisher=FrontPageMagazine.com|accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10218">'''Wilkes Land crater''' is an informal term that may apply to two separate cases of conjectured giant [[impact crater]]s hidden beneath the [[ice cap]] of [[Wilkes Land]], [[East Antarctica]]. These are separated below under the heading '''Wilkes Land anomaly''' and '''Wilkes Land mascon (mass concentration)''', based on terms used in their principal published reference sources.

==Wilkes Land anomaly==
A giant impact crater beneath the Wilkes Land ice sheet was first proposed by [[R. A. Schmidt]] in 1962 on the basis of the seismic and gravity discovery of the feature made by the U.S. Victoria Land Traverse in 1959–60 (VLT), and the data provided to Schmidt by J. G. Weihaupt, geophysicist of the VLT (Geophysical Studies in Victoria Land, Antarctica, Report No. 1, Geophysical and Polar Research Center, University of Wisconsin, 1–123).&lt;ref name="s62"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schmidt |first=RA |date=1962 |title=Australites and Antarctica |journal=Science |volume=138 |issue=3538 |pages=443–444 |id=[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/138/3538/443 Abstract] |doi=10.1126/science.138.3538.443 |pmid=17794921 |bibcode=1962Sci...138..443S}}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmidt further considered the possibility that it might be the elusive source of the [[tektite]]s of the [[Australasian strewnfield]] (which is only 790,000 years old).

[[File:EGM2008 gravity anomaly map.svg|thumb|270px|EGM2008 gravity anomaly map]]
The hypothesis was detailed in a paper by J. G. Weihaupt in 1976.&lt;ref name="w76"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weihaupt |first=JG |date=1976 |title=The Wilkes Land anomaly: Evidence for a possible hypervelocity impact crater |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=81 |issue=B32 |pages=5651–5663 |id=[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1976JGR....81.5651W Abstract] |doi=10.1029/JB081i032p05651 |bibcode=1976JGR....81.5651W}}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence cited included a large negative [[gravity anomaly]] coincident with a subglacial [[depression (geology)|topographic depression]] {{convert|243|km|mi}} across and having a minimum depth of {{convert|848|m|ft}}.

The claims were challenged by C. R. Bentley in 1979.&lt;ref name="b79"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bentley |first=CR |date=September 10, 1979 |title=No giant meteorite crater in Wilkes Land, Antarctica |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=84 |pages=5681–5682 |id=[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979JGR....84.5681B Abstract] |doi=10.1029/JB084iB10p05681 |bibcode=1979JGR....84.5681B}}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of a 2010 paper by J. G. Weihaupt et al.,&lt;ref name="w10"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weihaupt |first=JG |date=2010 |title=Gravity anomalies of the Antarctic lithosphere |journal=Lithosphere |volume=2 |issue= |pages=454–461 |id=[http://lithosphere.gsapubs.org/content/2/6/454 Abstract] |doi=10.1130/l116.1|bibcode=2010Lsphe...2..454W }}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Bentley's challenge was proven to be incorrect, and the [[Earth Impact Database]] (Rajmon 2011) has now reclassified the Wilkes Land Anomaly from a "possible impact crater" to a "probable impact crater" on the basis of Weihaupt et al.'s paper. Several other potential impact crater sites have now been proposed by other investigators in the Ross Sea, West Antarctica, and the Weddell Sea.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Wilkes Land mass concentration==
[[File:Antarctica Map Wilkes L Crater.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of Antarctica showing Wilkes Land, with the crater conjectured by von Frese and team marked in red]]
The Wilkes Land [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentration]] (or ''mascon'') is centered at {{Coord|70|S|120|E|display=inline,title}} and was first reported at a conference in May 2006 by a team of researchers led by [[Ralph von Frese]] and [[Laramie Potts]] of [[Ohio State University]].&lt;ref name="vfp06"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frese |first1=RR von|last2=Potts |first2=L |last3=Wells |first3=S. |last4=Gaya-Piqué |first4=L. |last5=Golynsky |first5=A.

The team used gravity measurements by [[NASA|NASA's]] [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] satellites to identify a {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide mass concentration and noted that this mass anomaly is centered within a larger ring-like structure visible in radar images of the land surface beneath the [[Antarctic ice cap]]. This combination suggested to them that the feature may mark the site of a {{convert|480|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} wide [[impact crater]] buried beneath the ice and more than 2.5 times larger than the {{convert|180|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} [[Chicxulub crater]].

Due to the site's location beneath the Antarctic [[ice sheet]] there are no direct samples to test for evidence of impact. There are alternative explanations for this mass concentration, such as formation by a [[mantle plume]] or other large-scale [[volcanic]] activity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} If this feature really is an impact crater then, based on the size of the ring structure, it has been suggested by Frese's team that the [[Impact event|impactor]] could have been four or five times wider than the [[Chicxulub impactor]], which is believed to have caused the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].&lt;ref name="big bang"/&gt;

Because mass concentrations on Earth are expected to dissipate over time, Frese and his collaborators believe the structure must be less than 500 million years old and also note that it appears to have been disturbed by the [[rift valley]] that formed 100 million years ago during the separation of [[Australia]] from the [[Gondwana]] supercontinent.&lt;ref name="big bang"/&gt;

These researchers therefore speculate that the putative impact and associated crater may have contributed to this separation by weakening the earth's crust at this location. These bracketing dates also make it possible that the site could be associated with the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]].&lt;ref name="big bang"/&gt; The Permian–Triassic extinction occurred 250 million years ago and is believed to be the largest extinction event since the origin of complex [[multicellular life]].

Plate reconstructions for the Permian–Triassic boundary place the putative crater directly [[antipodes|antipodal]] to the [[Siberian Traps]], and Frese et al. (2009) use the controversial [[antipodal hotspot#The impact hypothesis|theory that impacts can trigger massive volcanism at their antipodes]] to bolster their impact crater theory.&lt;ref name="VF09"&gt;Frese, R. von, Potts, L., Wells, S., Leftwich, T., Kim, H., et al., 2009, "GRACE gravity evidence for an impact basin in Wilkes Land, Antarctica," in ''Geochemistry, Geophysics, and Geosystems'', v. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are already other suggested candidates for giant impacts at the Permian–Triassic boundary, for example [[Bedout]] off the northern coast of [[Western Australia]], although all are equally contentious, and it is currently under debate whether or not an impact played any role in this extinction.

The complete absence of a well-defined impact ejecta layer associated with the Permian–Triassic boundary at its outcrops within Victoria Land and the central [[Transantarctic Mountains]] argues against there having been any impact capable of creating a crater the size of the hypothesized Wilkes Land impact crater within Antarctica at the Permian–Triassic boundary.&lt;ref name="RettallackOther1998"&gt;Retallack, G.

'''William Tecumsah Avery''' (November 11, 1819 – May 20, 1880) was an [[United States of America|American]] politician and a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] for the [[Tennessee's 10th congressional district|10th congressional district]] of [[Tennessee]].

==Biography==
Avery was born in [[Hardeman County, Tennessee]] on November 11, 1819, the son of Nathan and Rebecca Jones Rivers Avery. He attended the common schools, graduated from old Jackson College near [[Columbia, Tennessee]] in [[Maury County, Tennessee|Maury County]]. He studied law and was admitted to the [[bar association|bar]]. He moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] in 1840 and engaged in the practice of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Tecumsah Avery|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=A000347|publisher=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Emma Chastelette Jones in December 1852. They had three children, William Thomas, Harry Edwin, and Emma Blythe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Tecumsah Avery|url=http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=:1627334&amp;id=I73595807|publisher=Ancestry.com|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1843, Avery was a member of the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]]. He was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[Thirty-fifth United States Congress|Thirty-fifth]] and [[Thirty-sixth United States Congress|Thirty-sixth Congress]]. He served from March 4, 1857 to March 3, 1861,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Tecumsah Avery|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/william_avery/400998|publisher=Govtrack US Congress|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but he was not a candidate for renomination in 1860.

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Avery served as a [[lieutenant colonel]] in the [[Confederate Army]]. He was a clerk of the criminal court of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] from 1870 to 1874. He resumed the practice of law in Memphis, Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Who Was Who in American History - the Military|date=1975|publisher=Marquis Who's Who|location=Chicago|isbn=0837932017|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ylenia Maria Sole Carrisi''' (born November 29, 1970 – missing since January 6, 1994) was the eldest daughter of Italian singers and actors [[Albano Carrisi]] and [[Romina Power]]. She disappeared under mysterious circumstances while visiting [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] in January 1994. Carrisi, upon her father's request, was declared presumed dead in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suditalianews.com/2013/01/21/albano-carrisi-asks-for-the-official-declaration-of-death-of-her-daughter-ylenia/ Albano Carrisi asks for the official declaration of death of his daughter Ylenia] ''Sud Italia News''. 21 January 2013. Retrieved 23 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Carrisi was born in [[Rome]] on November 29, 1970, the eldest daughter of [[Albano Carrisi]] and [[Romina Power]]. Her maternal grandparents are American actor [[Tyrone Power]] and Mexican actress [[Linda Christian]].

==Life==
In 1983, she appeared alongside her parents in the Italian film ''Champagne in paradiso''. Later on, she was the letter-turner on ''[[La Ruota Della Fortuna]]'', the Italian version of ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. She planned to become a novelist, and studied literature at [[King's College London]], where she received the highest marks in her year.

==Disappearance==
[[File:StCharlesCBDSept2008ClosedHotelFront.jpg|right|thumb|LeDale Hotel on [[St. Charles Avenue]], New Orleans, where Carrisi was staying at the time of her disappearance.]]
During her studies, she began to entertain the idea of traveling the world solo with nothing but a backpack and her journal. She decided to take a break from studying and returned to Italy where she sold all her belongings in order to pay for the voyage. She began in South America. After having spent a few months in Belize, she decided to leave the day after Christmas 1993 by bus to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. Her brother Yari, also an experienced traveler, had decided to surprise his sister by visiting her that Christmas. He arrived on a rainy 27 December in the village of Hopkins, going door to door searching for her, only to find that the day before, she had boarded a bus to Mexico.

Carrisi was last seen in the [[French Quarter]] area around 6 January. Police efforts to find her did not yield any result. At the time of her disappearance, Carrisi was staying in the LeDale Hotel with African-American street musician Alexander Masakela, twenty years her senior. Masakela was arrested on January 31 on an unrelated charge&lt;ref name="Codrescu1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrei Codrescu|title=Hail Babylon!: NPR's Road Scholar Goes in Search of the American City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_S2LiTJmWpQC&amp;pg=PA28|date=19 June 1999|publisher=Picador|isbn=978-0-312-20653-6|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually released for lack of evidence to connect him to Carrisi's disappearance.

In relation to her disappearance, a security guard testified that he saw a woman vaguely matching her description jump into the [[Mississippi River]] saying the words "I belong in water." A [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] search turned up no sign of the young woman's body, which may have been washed out to sea. In any case, it has never been established that the person was Carrisi. In 1996, two years after her disappearance, an unidentified caller claimed that Carrisi was still alive but her whereabouts were unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adnkronos.com/Archivio/AdnAgenzia/1996/11/05/Cronaca/YLENIA-CARRISI-UN-LIBRO-INCHIESTA-RIAPRE-IL-CASO_140200.php YLENIA CARRISI: UN LIBRO INCHIESTA RIAPRE IL CASO] ''Adnkronos''.{{it}}  5 November 1996. Retrieved 21 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrisi's parents last heard from their daughter on New Year's Eve. They reported her missing on January 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/c/carrisi_ylenia.html Ylenia Maria Sole Carrisi] ''The Charley Project''. Retrieved 21 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother believes that she is still alive. In November 2006, her father Albano stated for the first time that he believed the security guard's story, the Mississippi river jump — a theory that Private Investigator Frank Crescentini never believed. Crescentini, involved on Ylenia's case for over 20 years, is still today searching for the truth. In an interview, Crescentini stated "Ylenia Carrisi is just another missing case, and I will hunt the truth. If she's dead, well then show me her body and a [[DNA]] report."  When asked about the declaration of the presumed death Crescentini simply replied, "insane and shocking." In January 2013, her father Albano requested the declaration of the presumed death of his daughter.

She was reportedly discovered in June 2011 in a monastery in the United States. Her father dismissed the report as "shameful speculation containing not a bit of truth."&lt;ref name=adnkronos&gt;{{cite news|title=US: Missing since '94, Tyrone Powers' granddaughter is 'living in Arizona convent' |url=http://www.adnkronos.com/IGN/Aki/English/CultureAndMedia/?id=3.1.2107779919 |accessdate=20 April 2013 |newspaper=Adnkronos |date=8 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045657/http://www.adnkronos.com/IGN/Aki/English/CultureAndMedia/?id=3.1.2107779919 |archivedate=April 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo''' (September 12, 1831 – April 25, 1852), affectionately called "'''Maneco'''" by his close friends, relatives and admirers, was a [[Brazil]]ian [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet, short story writer, playwright and essayist, considered to be one of the major exponents of [[Ultra-Romanticism]] and [[Gothic fiction|Gothic literature]] in Brazil. His works tend to play heavily with opposite notions, such as love and death, [[Platonic love|platonism]] and sarcasm, [[Sentimentalism (literature)|sentimentalism]] and [[pessimism]], among others, and have a strong influence of [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]], [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], [[Alphonse de Lamartine|Lamartine]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and – above all – [[Lord Byron|Byron]].

All of his works were published posthumously due to his premature death with only 20 years old after a horse-riding accident. They acquired a strong [[cult following]] as years went by, particularly among youths of the [[goth subculture]].

He is the patron of the second chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]], and of the ninth chair of the [[Academia Paulista de Letras|Paulista Academy of Letters]].

==Biography==
Azevedo was born into a wealthy family in [[São Paulo]], on September 12, 1831. Son of [[Law]] student Inácio Manuel Álvares de Azevedo and Maria Luísa Azevedo (''née'' Mota), a popular myth says that he was given birth in the library of the [[Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo|University of São Paulo Law School]], but it actually happened on the house of his maternal grandfather, Severo Mota.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academia.org.br/abl/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?sid=93 Álvares de Azevedo – Academia Brasileira de Letras] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a sister and a younger brother, Inácio Manuel Júnior, but he died prematurely in 1835. The death proved to be an early source of shock for the young Álvares.

In 1833, Álvares moved with his family to [[Rio de Janeiro]], and in 1840 he enrolled at the Colégio Stoll, in the ''[[bairro]]'' of [[Botafogo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://educacao.uol.com.br/biografias/alvares-de-azevedo.jhtm |title=Álvares de Azevedo |accessdate=27 March 2012 |author=UOL Educação }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844 he temporarily returned to São Paulo with his uncle, going back to Rio in the following year, where he enrolled at the [[Colégio Pedro II]]. There he learned [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], and, being a very avid reader, got acquainted with the works of [[Lord Byron]], [[François-René de Chateaubriand]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[George Sand]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Keats]], [[Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage|Manuel du Bocage]], [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Alfred de Musset]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] and [[Thomas Chatterton]], which would heavily influence his writing style.

Having graduated in 1846 from the Colégio Pedro II, he was admitted to the [[Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo|University of São Paulo Law School]] in the following year, where he befriended poets [[José Bonifácio the Younger]] (the grandnephew of famous Brazilian [[politician|statesman]] [[José Bonifácio de Andrada|José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva]]), [[Aureliano Lessa]] and [[Bernardo Guimarães]]. Alongside these poets and others, he founded the infamous "Sociedade Epicureia" ("[[Epicurus|Epicurean]] Society"), a mythical club heavily based upon [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] thought, and also planned a work in conjunction with Lessa and Guimarães, the poetry book ''As Três Liras'' (''The Three Lyres'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mundoeducacao.com.br/literatura/alvares-azevedopoeta-ultrarromantico.htm |title=Álvares de Azevedo – O poeta ultrarromântico |accessdate=27 March 2012 |publisher=Mundo Educação}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''As Três Liras'' project never came to be; the only surviving part of it today is the book ''[[Lira dos Vinte Anos]]'', published one year after Azevedo's death, in 1853. He also founded in 1849 the official magazine of the Sociedade Ensaio Filosófico Paulistano, whose publication ceased in 1856.

Because of his fragile health and the murky weather of São Paulo, Azevedo contracted [[tuberculosis]]. He then abandoned college and moved to his grandfather's farm in Rio, where the weather was warmer, in order to mitigate his disease's symptoms; there he fell from a [[horse]] and fractured his [[iliac fossa]]. After an unsuccessful surgery, he died, on April 25, 1852, being only 20 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itaucultural.org.br/aplicexternas/enciclopedia_lit/index.cfm?fuseaction=biografias_texto&amp;cd_verbete=4950&amp;cd_item=35 |title=Azevedo, Álvares de (1831–1852) |accessdate=27 March 2012 |author=Enciclopédia Itaú Cultural }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried one day later at the [[Cemitério de São João Batista|Saint John the Baptist Cemetery]]; his last words before his death were reported to be "Que fatalidade, meu pai!" ("What a fatality, my father!"). Ironically, one of the last poems Azevedo wrote prior to his death was entitled "Se Eu Morresse Amanhã" ("If I Died Tomorrow") – the poem was read at his funeral by [[Manuel Antônio de Almeida]], who also happened to be one of Azevedo's cousins.

Another one of Azevedo's cousins, Maria Catarina de Abreu Sodré, eventually married famous novelist [[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo]], who allegedly based the character Carolina of his novel ''[[A Moreninha]]'' on her.

==Works==
* ''[[Lira dos Vinte Anos]]'' (1853; poetry [[anthology]])
* ''[[Macário]]'' (1855; [[play (theatre)|theater play]])
* ''[[Noite na Taverna]]'' (1855; [[short story]] book, under pen name '''Job Stern''')
* ''O Conde Lopo'' (1886; an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] that remains only in fragments today)
* ''O Poema do Frade'' (1890; [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]])

Azevedo also wrote many letters and essays, and translated into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] numerous poems by [[Victor Hugo]], [[Lord Byron]]'s "[[Parisina]]", [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]''{{'}}s fifth act and [[Heinrich Heine]]'s poem "Sag' mir wer einst die Uhren erfund" (present in his ''Lira dos Vinte Anos'' under the title "Relógios e Beijos"). He also wrote a novel, ''O Livro de Fra. Gondicário''; however, the only extant parts of it today are two fragments of its third chapter.

==Representations in popular culture==
* Azevedo is the main character of Mário Teixeira's 2009 [[Young adult fiction|young adult novel]] ''Alma de Fogo'' ({{ISBN|9788508126774}}). The novel's premise is that a [[serial killer]] is on the loose in the streets of São Paulo, and Azevedo decides to investigate alongside his friends Aureliano Lessa and Bernardo Guimarães.
* ''[[Noite na Taverna]]'' was adapted into [[Noite na Taverna#Adaptations|a film]] in 2014, in which Azevedo appears as a character portrayed by Victor Mendes.
* A semi-fictionalized biography of Azevedo, ''Delírio, Poesia e Morte'' ({{ISBN|9788564590861}}), was written by Luciana Fátima and released on June 27, 2015 through Editora Estronho. Fátima previously wrote a lengthy essay regarding Azevedo's life and ''œuvre'' in 2009, entitled ''Álvares de Azevedo: O Poeta que Não Conheceu o Amor Foi Noivo da Morte'' ({{ISBN|9788574199047}}).
* A 2014 [[Children's literature|children's book]] by Márcia Abreu, ''Morrer Amanhã'' ({{ISBN|9788532290908}}), elaborates a story based on the friendship between Azevedo and a fictional character, the [[Slavery in Brazil|Afro-Brazilian slave]] Tonico.
