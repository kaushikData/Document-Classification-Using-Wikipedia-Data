'''Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol''' ({{IPA-ro|alekˈsandru diˈmitri.e kseˈnopol}}; March 23, 1847, [[Iaşi]] – February 27, 1920, [[Bucharest]]) was a Romanian historian, philosopher, professor, economist, sociologist, and author. Among his many major accomplishments, he is the [[Romania]]n [[historian]] credited with authoring the first major synthesis of the [[History of Romania|history of the Romanian people]].

==Life==
Born in Iaşi,&lt;ref&gt;in his writing ''Istoria ideilor mele'' ("The History of My Ideas") (reprinted in I. E. Torouţiu, ''Studii şi documente literare''. Vol. IV. Junimea, Bucureşti: Inst. Arte grafice Bucovina, 1933) he claims that his father had Anglo-Saxon ancestors. Available at Wikisource (in Romanian)&lt;/ref&gt; where he graduated from high school, he went on to [[Vienna]] in 1870 to study law and then to [[Berlin]], where he studied philosophy. In 1868, he made his debut in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' with a series of studies on Romanian traditions and on Romanian institutions.

At first, Xenopol served as a prosecutor in Iaşi, but he later decided to dedicate himself to the study of history. Starting in 1883, he was a professor of universal history at the [[University of Iaşi]], where he served as rector from 1898 to 1901. He was elected [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]] in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://acad.ro/bdar/armembriLit.php?vidT=X| title=Membrii Academiei Române din 1866 până în prezent| newspaper=Acad.ro| date= | author= The Romanian Academy| accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1899 French-language ''Les Principes fondamentaux de l'histoire'' ("The Fundamental Principles of History"), his work most well-known internationally,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} he argued for history being a true science which follows clearly defined laws and logic, through which the reasons for historical processes could be clearly defined.

His six-volume ''Istoria românilor din Dacia-Traiană'' ("The History of the Romanians in [[Trajan]]'s [[Dacia]]"), completed between 1888 and 1893, strongly asserts that the Romanians are of predominantly [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin - a position further elaborated by the historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], one of Xenopol's numerous pupils (see [[Origin of the Romanians]]).

Concerning events nearly two millennia in the past and being supported by multiple archaeological findings, it was still contested by some historians. It had, however, very concrete political implications - the Roman origin implying that Romanians are inherently different from their [[Slav]]ic and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] neighbors. This, despite his disagreement with radical nationalists and objection to violence against Jews,&lt;ref&gt;http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Na%C8%9Bionalism_%C8%99i_antisemitism&lt;/ref&gt; unfortunately also translated to Xenopol being a noted [[Anti-semitism|anti-Semite]] and collaborator of [[A. C. Cuza]]. Though he died before the formation of the [[Iron Guard]], Romania's notorious [[Fascist]] party, he is considered to be one of its sources of inspiration - according to the final report of the [[International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;available through the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18392">[[File:Anna lo pizzo iww martyr.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Photo, Memorial Day 1912, Lawrence, Massachusetts, at the grave of Anna LoPizzo]]'''Anna LoPizzo''' was a striker killed during the [[Lawrence Textile Strike]] (also known as the [[Bread and Roses]] Strike), considered one of the most significant struggles in U.S. labor history. [[Eugene Debs]] said of the strike, "The Victory at Lawrence was the most decisive and far-reaching ever won by organized labor."&lt;ref&gt;''Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood'', Peter Carlson, 1983, page 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Author Peter Carlson saw this strike conducted by the militant [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) as a turning point. He wrote, "Wary of [a war with the anti-capitalist IWW], some mill owners swallowed their hatred of unions and actually ''invited'' the AFL to organize their workers.&lt;ref&gt;''Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood'', Peter Carlson, 1983, page 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna LoPizzo's death was significant to both sides in the struggle. Wrote Bruce Watson in his epic ''Bread and Roses: Mills, Migrants, and the Struggle for the American Dream'', "If America had a Tomb of the Unknown Immigrant paying tribute to the millions of immigrants known only to God and distant cousins compiling family trees, Anna LoPizzo would be a prime candidate to lie in it."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Watson, ''Bread and Roses: Mills, Migrants, and the Struggle for the American Dream''. Penguin Books. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anna LoPizzo in life==

Ardis Cameron describes the immigrant's world in which Anna LoPizzo lived:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Relying on old-world practices and principles of collectivity, the immigrant community routinely "swapped" names and falsified documents to evade "impossible" laws and ensure mutual survival...&lt;ref&gt;Radicals of the Worst Sort: Laboring Women in Lawrence Massachusetts, 1860-1912, Ardis Cameron, 1995, page 106, University of Illinois Press, {{ISBN|0-252-06318-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Falsification of documents might serve a number of purposes &amp;mdash; citizenship status, job experience, age requirements...

&lt;blockquote&gt;[In America immigrants often] took the name of the person who got [them] the job. To those who lived on Common Street [in Lawrence, Massachusetts], Anna LoPizzo, a slain mill worker during the strike of 1912, was Anna LaMonica, once too young to work.&lt;ref&gt;Radicals of the Worst Sort: Laboring Women in Lawrence Massachusetts, 1860-1912, Ardis Cameron, 1995, page 106, University of Illinois Press, {{ISBN|0-252-06318-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upon her death, Anna's adopted name was destined to become the name by which she would be known for all time.

==Anna LoPizzo's death==

Fred Thompson's book ''The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years'' states that, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;On Jan. 29 a peaceful parade of the strikers was charged by the militia, and officer Oscar Benoit firing into the crowd, hit striker Anna Lo Pezza (sic), killing her.&lt;ref&gt;The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years, Fred W. Thompson &amp; Patrick Murfin, 1976, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his autobiography [[Bill Haywood|Big Bill Haywood]] wrote that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;...nineteen witnesses had seen Policeman Benoit murder the girl.&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, William Dudley Haywood, 1929, page 249.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the book ''Roughneck'', Peter Carlson has written,

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the barricades, pickets and police began to push and shove each other. The police advanced, packing the retreating marchers so tight that they could no longer move, and then began clubbing. Some strikers fought back. A policeman received a stab wound. A police sergeant ordered his men to draw their weapons and fire. Their shots killed a young Italian striker named Anna LoPizzo.&lt;ref&gt;''Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood'', Peter Carlson, 1983, page 166.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IWW offered its own account a year after the strike, based upon trial proceedings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[On] January 29, a striker, Annie LoPizzo, was killed on the corner of Union and Garden Streets, during police and military interference with lawful picketing. She was shot by a bullet said to have been fired by Police Officer Oscar Benoit, though Benoit and Police Officer Marshall claim it was fired from behind Benoit by a personal enemy of the latter, following an altercation. Be that as it may, both Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti were arrested; charged with inciting and procuring the commission of the crime in [pursuit] of an unlawful conspiracy. Though the murderer was unknown, they were held as "accessories before the fact.&lt;ref&gt;The Trial of a New Society, Being a Review of The Celebrated Ettor-Giovannitti-Caruso Case, Beginning with the Lawrence Textile Strike that caused it and including the general strike that grew out of it, CHAPTER III. THE INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY OVERCOMES ALL OPPOSITION, April 1913, Published by I.W.W. PUBLISHING BUREAU, From http://www.workerseducation.org/crutch/pamphlets/ebert_trial/chapter3.html Retrieved February 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ettor and Giovannitti were IWW organizers arrested for the murder.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The testimony of Officers Benoit and Marshall showed that the fatal shot had been fired at Benoit by a man who had a personal grudge against Benoit, and who took advantage of the troublous times to square accounts... Other testimony showed Officer Benoit to be the killer of Annie Lo Pizzo.&lt;ref&gt;The Trial of a New Society, Being a Review of The Celebrated Ettor-Giovannitti-Caruso Case, Beginning with the Lawrence Textile Strike that caused it and including the general strike that grew out of it, CHAPTER V, THE INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY TRIUMPHS IN COURT, April 1913, Published by I.W.W. PUBLISHING BUREAU, From http://www.workerseducation.org/crutch/pamphlets/ebert_trial/chapter5.html Retrieved February 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A third man was arrested for the murder; however,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Three witnesses—his landlord, his child's god-father and his wife—helped Caruso to establish a complete alibi; he was at home eating supper when Annie Lo Pizzo was alleged to have been shot by him... Caruso said he was not a member of the I.W.W., but would join as soon as he got out [of the jail].&lt;ref&gt;The Trial of a New Society, Being a Review of The Celebrated Ettor-Giovannitti-Caruso Case, Beginning with the Lawrence Textile Strike that caused it and including the general strike that grew out of it, CHAPTER V, THE INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY TRIUMPHS IN COURT, April 1913, Published by I.W.W. PUBLISHING BUREAU, From http://www.workerseducation.org/crutch/pamphlets/ebert_trial/chapter5.html Retrieved February 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Immigrants in the Lawrence mills==

Lawrence, Massachusetts was home to many textile mills which relied heavily upon immigrant labor. According to Carlson the strike was "a spontaneous revolt by immigrants who had arrived in Lawrence expecting a land of opportunity, but found instead a claustrophobic life of hard work and low pay."&lt;ref&gt;''Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood'', Peter Carlson, 1983, page 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson continues,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is obvious," the State Bureau of Labor Statistics concluded in 1911, "that the full-time earnings of a large number of adult employees are entirely inadequate for a family." Consequently, the average Lawrence family sent mother, father, and all children over the legal minimum age of fourteen to work. The dirty, crowded mills were breeding grounds for disease. Tuberculosis and other respiratory ailments killed some 70 percent of the city's mill workers. "A considerable number of the boys and girls die within the first two or three years after beginning work," wrote Dr. Elizabeth Shapleigh, a Lawrence physician. "Thirty-six of every 100 of all men and women who work in the mills die before or by the time they are 25 years of age." ... While the mill hands lived and died in poverty, their employers thrived.&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 161.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Industrial Workers of the World already had a significant presence in the Lawrence mills. Fred Thompson has written,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A persistent myth about the IWW is that it plunged into strikes without previous organization, bringing out contented workers with spell-binding oratory, won great victories, then deserted the workers to repeat the process elsewhere. The myth is groundless... Prior to its fame at Lawrence the IWW had been organizing textile workers for seven years, and these constituted roughly half of its membership.&lt;ref&gt;The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years, Fred W. Thompson &amp; Patrick Murfin, 1976, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IWW's national organizers became involved when the Italian immigrant community in Lawrence sent a telegram to organizer [[Joseph Ettor]].&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, William Dudley Haywood, 1929, page 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Ettor was an Italian and, at age 27, already a veteran organizer for the IWW.&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haywood wrote in his autobiography that there were about twenty-eight different nationalities among the strikers, and they spoke forty-five different dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, William Dudley Haywood, 1929, page 247.&lt;/ref&gt; (Thompson reported 16 "major" languages.)&lt;ref&gt;The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years, Fred W. Thompson &amp; Patrick Murfin, 1976, page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ettor and fellow organizer [[Arturo Giovannitti]] had successfully organized the strike by the time chief IWW organizer Bill Haywood arrived. Within a month of walking out of the mills, there were twenty-five thousand workers participating in the strike.&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, William Dudley Haywood, 1929, page 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Haywood was sufficiently impressed that he thought it appropriate to leave the strike in the hands of his experienced organizers, and go on a speaking tour of northeastern U.S. cities in support of the strike.&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The charges and the trial==

The death of Anna LoPizzo was used by the authorities during the Lawrence Strike as a means of disrupting and pressuring the union. Although union leaders [[Joseph Ettor|Ettor]] and [[Arturo Giovannitti|Giovannitti]] were two miles away at the time of her death, they were charged with her murder and imprisoned without bail until trial.&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Haywood cut short his tour, and returned to take control of the strike effort.

The trial of Caruso, Ettor and Giovannitti was held on September 30, keeping the two capable and multi-lingual organizers out of action for eight months. At trial, Ettor and Giovannitti were locked in metal cages. The district attorney referred to them as "social vultures" and "labor buzzards." Yet they were not accused of the murder for which they were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 190.&lt;/ref&gt; All three were acquitted.

==Significance of Anna LoPizzo's death==

Anna LoPizzo's death on the picket line had given the authorities a chance to remove the two main organizers from action for the duration of the strike, but it also became a rallying cry for the workers to demand justice. The March 10–17, 1999 issue of ''Metro Santa Cruz'' offers an example of how the strikers reacted. An excerpt:

{{quote|Mill owners who had predicted a quick end to the strike after LoPizzo's death were surprised when, a few days later, a group of enraged Italian women happened upon a lone police officer on an icy bridge. After stripping him of his gun, club and badge, they sliced the officer's suspenders and took off his pants--a humiliation technique popular with the disorderly women of Lawrence--and dangled the officer over the freezing river. That put an end to any hope that they would quickly scurry back to work...

Consiglia Teutonica ... helped historian Ardis Cameron piece together oral histories of the Bread and Roses strike. She told of a protest following LoPizzo's death when soldiers again drew their guns and bayonets. According to Teutonica, this time a 22-year-old Syrian immigrant named Annie Kiami stepped in front of the crowd. Calling the soldiers "Cossacks," Kiami wrapped an American flag around her body and dared them to shoot holes in Old Glory.

Once thought of as docile and subservient, the Bread and Roses women quickly gained the notorious title among mill owners of radicals of the worst sort.

"One policeman can handle 10 men," Lawrence's district attorney lamented, "while it takes 10 policemen to handle one woman."

In the words of one horrified boss, the women activists were full of "lots of cunning and also lots of bad temper. They're everywhere, and it's getting worse all the time."&lt;ref&gt;From "Bread Winners", Mary Spicuzza, March 10–17, 1999 issue of Metro Santa Cruz http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/03.10.99/women3-9910.html Accessed February 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The strike was successful because the workers stayed united in their demands.&lt;ref&gt;''Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood'', Peter Carlson, 1983, page 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Business writers began to question employers' and the local authorities' tactics relating not only to the strike, but specifically relating to the handling of Anna LoPizzo's death. One writer concerned about the success of the IWW's organizing tactics was Arno Dosch, who wrote in the magazine ''The [[World's Work]]'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;The efforts that have been made by employers and by governmental authorities to repress the movement have been worse than useless. Every move that has been made against the I. W. W. has had the effect of winning sympathy... The trial of the three agitators, Mr. Ettor, Mr. Giovannitti, and Mr. Caruso, for the murder of a woman whose death was indirectly due to the strike, was a tactical error. Mr. Ettor won the support of millions of people when he said, " I have been tried here not for my acts, but for my views.&lt;ref&gt;Arno Dosch, "WHAT THE I.W.W. IS", The World's Work, vol. XXVI, no. 4 (August 1913), pp. 406-420, accessed February 20, 2007 at http://www.workerseducation.org/crutch/others/dosch.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before the Lawrence Strike and the trial for the death of Anna LoPizzo, many businessmen categorically refused to recognize any unions. After the strike, the [[American Federation of Labor]] was courted by some employers, if only as a bulwark against the radical and militant [[Industrial Workers of the World]].

Carlson records,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shortly after the Lawrence strike, John Golden, president of the AFL's [[United Textile Workers of America|United Textile Workers union]] (a rival to the IWW's organizing efforts in Lawrence), observed that frightened mill owners "are falling all over themselves now to do business with our organization." [[Lincoln Steffens]] summed up the attitude of the panicky mill bosses. "Haywood makes [[Samuel Gompers|Gompers]] look like an angel," he wrote. "The IWW makes the millmen sigh for the AFL."&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 191.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The foreboding on the part of employers resulted from their fears about what this new labor organization, the IWW, actually represented. Thompson quoted [[Harry Emerson Fosdick|Harry Fosdick]] in the June issue of ''Outlook'' in 1912,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wages have been raised, work has been resumed, the militia has gone, and the whirring looms suggest industrial peace; but behind all this the most revolutionary organization in the history of American industry is building up an army of volunteers. The I.W.W. leaves behind as hopelessly passé, the methods of the American Federation of Labor.&lt;ref&gt;The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years, Fred W. Thompson &amp; Patrick Murfin, 1976, page 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some believed that the success of the strikers called for other measures. Fosdick quoted a Boston lawyer who stated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The strike should have been stopped in the first twenty-four hours. The militia should have been instructed to shoot. That is the way Napoleon did it.&lt;ref&gt;Bread and Roses: The 1912 Lawrence textile Strike, By Joyce Kornbluh, {{cite web|url=http://www.lucyparsonsproject.org/iww/kornbluh_bread_roses.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224211828/http://www.lucyparsonsproject.org/iww/kornbluh_bread_roses.html |archivedate=2007-02-24 |df= }} retrieved February 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Commemoration==

News item (excerpt):

&lt;blockquote&gt;October 2, 2000 &amp;mdash; A MARKER FOR A MARTYR &amp;mdash; Anna Lopizzo was killed Jan. 28, 1912, at age 34, shot through the heart during the Bread and Roses strike in Lawrence, Mass., when more than 30,000 laborers were on strike for 63 days against American Woolen Co., after management cut wages. Her grave was unmarked for 88 years, until David R. Morris, assistant business manager of [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers|Electrical Workers]] Local 2321 in North Andover, set about getting a headstone made. Granite cutters in Barre, Vt., where children of the strikers were taken for safety in 1912, donated a headstone carved with the Bread and Roses symbol &amp;mdash; grain stalks and a rose. The gravestone was displayed at Lawrence Heritage State Park as part of the annual Bread and Roses festival until Labor Day and placed on her grave in ceremonies held Sept. 14.&lt;ref&gt;News item from ''Work in Progress'': http://unionyes.htmlplanet.com/newfile.html Retrieved February 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Arsène Tchakarian''' (December 21, 1916 – August 4, 2018) was a [[Armenians in France|French-Armenian]] [[historian]], former tailor and member of the [[French resistance]]. He was a member of the [[Manouchian Group]] of the [[FTP-MOI]], a wing of the larger [[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]] (FTP) composed of fighters of foreign immigrant origin. Tchakarian was the last surviving member of the Manouchian Group (''Groupe Manouchian''), a [[Paris]]-based resistance cell led by [[Missak Manouchian]].&lt;ref name=dw&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=French foreign-resistance fighter Arsene Tchakarian dies at 101 |url=https://www.dw.com/en/french-foreign-resistance-fighter-arsene-tchakarian-dies-at-101/a-44962466 |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=2018-08-05 |accessdate=2018-09-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828170423/https://www.dw.com/en/french-foreign-resistance-fighter-arsene-tchakarian-dies-at-101/a-44962466 |archivedate=2018-08-28 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=figaro&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Décès d'Arsène Tchakarian, dernier survivant du "groupe Manouchian" |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2018/08/05/01016-20180805ARTFIG00116-deces-d-arsene-tchakarian-dernier-survivant-du-groupe-manouchian.php |work=[[Le Figaro]] |date=2018-08-05 |accessdate=2018-09-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831175413/http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2018/08/05/01016-20180805ARTFIG00116-deces-d-arsene-tchakarian-dernier-survivant-du-groupe-manouchian.php |archivedate=2018-08-31 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rfe&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=French Resistance Fighter Tchakarian Dies At Age 101, Last Of Famed Manouchian Group  |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/french-resistance-fighter-armenian-manouchian-group-tchakarian-dies/29413845.html |work=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |date=2018-08-05 |accessdate=2018-09-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822034700/https://www.rferl.org/a/french-resistance-fighter-armenian-manouchian-group-tchakarian-dies/29413845.html |archivedate=2018-08-22 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{cite news|first=Phil|last=Davison|title=Arsène Tchakarian, World War II resistance fighter in France, dies at 101  |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/arsene-tchakarian-world-war-ii-resistance-fighter-in-france-dies-at-101/2018/08/10/27624eb6-9a51-11e8-8d5e-c6c594024954_story.html?utm_term=.1f187c5ff1e4 |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=2018-08-10 |accessdate=2018-09-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180902041525/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/arsene-tchakarian-world-war-ii-resistance-fighter-in-france-dies-at-101/2018/08/10/27624eb6-9a51-11e8-8d5e-c6c594024954_story.html?utm_term=.1f187c5ff1e4 |archivedate=2018-09-02 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Tchakarian was born to an [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|ethnic Armenian]] family in [[Sapanca]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] (present-day [[Turkey]]) on December 21, 1916.&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; The family fled to [[Bulgaria]] to escape the [[Armenian Genocide]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; Tchakarian arrived in France in 1930 with his family and settled permanently in the country.&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; He worked as a [[tailor]].&lt;ref name=dw/&gt;

In 1937, Tchakarian was conscripted into the [[French Army]], where he served until 1940. He was discharged from the Army in 1940 following the [[Battle of France|defeat]] and occupation of France by [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; He then became active in the nascent [[French resistance]].

===Manouchian Group and the French Resistance===

In 1942, Tchakarian joined the [[Manouchian Group]], a small armed group within the larger [[FTP-MOI]] that was composed primarily of immigrant and foreign-origin resistance fighters.&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; The group was commanded by [[Missak Manouchian]], an ethnic Armenian communist and [[poet]].&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; In addition to [[Armenians]], like himself, the Manouchian Group contained immigrants and refugees from other countries invaded by Nazi Germany, as well as [[Jews]].&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; According to Tchakarian, immigrants from fascist countries and those occupied by Nazi Germany were drawn to the resistance and cells like the Manouchian Group, "They were immigrants who had come from countries that were becoming [[fascist]], like [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]]...From all those countries, there were immigrants who were kind of hunted out."&lt;ref name=dw/&gt;

Together, the Manouchian Group, which were base in the Paris region, carried out resistance attacks, assassinations, and acts of sabotage across the country.&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; In 1944, German authorities captured 23 Manouchian members, including their leader, Missak Manouchian. The members were sentenced to death and executed following a high-profile [[show trial]].&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; Following their executions, German and [[Vichy French]] authorities launched a [[propaganda]] campaign against the Manouchian Group.&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; Red posters, which became infamously known as "[[Affiche Rouge]]", were hung in Paris during the spring of 1944. The Affiche Rouge depicted the Manouchian Group and its members as "the army of crime" in a bid to turn French [[public opinion]] against the resistance.&lt;ref name=dw/&gt;

Unlike his 23 Manouchian colleagues, Tchakarian managed to escape capture and execution in 1944. He fled to [[Bordeaux]], where he was hidden by other French resistance members.&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; However, he remained an active resistance member until the end of [[World War II]] in 1945.&lt;ref name=dw/&gt;

===Post-war===
In 1950, Arsène Tchakarian moved to the Parisian suburb of [[Vitry-sur-Seine]], where he lived until his death in 2018.&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; Tchakarian was granted [[French citizenship]] in 1958.&lt;ref name=dw/&gt;

Tchakarian became a respected historian in the decades following World War II. His writings focused on the Armenian Genocide and [[French history]].&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; Tchakarian campaigned for the international recognition of the Armenian Genocide, from which he and his family had fled as refugees.&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; He visited schools and universities to speak about his experiences during the genocide in the Ottoman Empire and the Nazi German occupation of France. Additionally, Tchakarian authored several [[memoirs]].&lt;ref name=dw/&gt;

The French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' quoted Tchakarian as saying, "I'm sort of the [[last of the Mohicans]], as they say," as he noted that he was one of the last surviving members of the FTP-MOI and the resistance.&lt;ref name=dw/&gt;&lt;ref name=figaro/&gt;

In 2012, French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] awarded him the [[Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref name=dw/&gt; Most recently, Tchakarian attended a ceremony in commoration of the French Resistance on June 18, 2018.&lt;ref name=dw/&gt;

Arsène Tchakarian, the last surviving member of the [[Manouchian Group]], died at the [[Hôpital Paul-Brousse]] in [[Villejuif]], France, on August 4, 2018, at the age of 101.&lt;ref name=figaro/&gt; In a [[Twitter]] post, French President [[Emmanuel Macron]] paid tribute to his time in the resistance and work as a historian, calling Tchakarian "a hero of the resistance and a tireless witness whose voice resounded with force until the end."&lt;ref name=dw/&gt;&lt;ref name=figaro/&gt;

The '''''Bevis''''', also known as the ''Bevis of Hampton,'' was a [[merchant]] [[sailing ship]] that brought "Emigrants"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.packrat-pro.com/ships/bevis.htm Bevis 1638&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; from England to New England in 1638,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; this at a time when thousands of [[Puritans]] left [[England]] seeking freedom of [[religious practice]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Gracy, David B., Moses Austin: his life (Trinity University Press, 1987), pp. 5-6. {{ISBN|0-911536-84-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The [[Ship's Master|Ship Master]] was named Robert Batten.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  One voyage in May of 1638 carried 61 settlers from [[Southampton, England]], leaving before 12 May 1638 in which they were “some Dayes gone to sea”,&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; to "Newengland", all one word.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  The ship's passenger destinations included: [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newbury]], [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]], [[Wells, Maine]], [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], Salisbury, and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charlestown]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Planters of the Commonwealth in Massachusetts" by Charles E. Banks&lt;/ref&gt;

No verified details of this merchant ship, its age or fate is known other than "Beuis(t) of Hampton of CL. Tonnes". This translates to “Bevis of Hampton, 150 tons.” The (t) was actually a footnote reference symbol in the form of a Latin cross (✝️). The “burthen” or weight bearing capacity of cargo of the ''Bevis'' was 150 tons. This does not mean the ship weighed only 150 tons because it more likely weighed three times (450 gross weight) or more of its cargo capacity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.littlefieldhistory.com/littlefield/TheBevis1638.html The Passenger List of The Bevis (1638)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107100409/http://www.littlefieldhistory.com/littlefield/TheBevis1638.html |date=January 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many of the three masted merchant ships traveling across the Atlantic Ocean about this same time period were in the 450 to 650 ton range.&lt;Ref&gt; [https://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/elizabethan-merchant-ships-and-shipbuilding  Elizabethean Merchant Ships and Ship Building] by Dr. Ian Friel, FSA. Dated 29 September 2009, Museum of London, courtesy of Gresham College. &lt;/ref&gt;  

The cargo or “goods” were certified (not loaded) on 12 May 1638. Yet the ship had been “some Dayes gone to sea” by 2 May 1638.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The shippers of the goods were Richard Dumer &amp; Co. Henry Byles &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;Public Records Office: Classes CO1/9/112 and E190/824/9 as referenced in "The Complete Book of Emigrants, 1607-1660" by Peter Coldham&lt;/ref&gt; 

The exact date of departure is often not known since departures often coincided with the daylight outgoing or “ebb” tide. This being anywhere from a few hours to more than a day after clearance was given to leave port. Some have cited 16 May 1638 and 12 May 1638) as the departure date, but without proof. Again, the had been “some Dayes gone to sea” by 2 May 1638.

“They landed probably at Boston (the point of all but a handful of Bay Colony arrivals) in June or July 1638 (the average ocean crossing took five to eight weeks).”&lt;ref&gt;[http://carpentercousins.com/Wm1_Shalbourne.pdf WILLIAM1 CARPENTER OF NEWTOWN, SHALBOURNE, WILTSHIRE (BEVIS, 1638)] by [[Eugene Zubrinsky|Eugene Cole Zubrinsky, FASG]] who also cites: NEHGR 14:336 = The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, vol. 1 (1847) through present.&lt;/ref&gt;

She completed the voyage to the Americas because her passengers arrived and took up residence there. Her fate thereafter is unknown.

The 61 documented Bevis passengers enumerated or attested to on 2 May 1638 were mostly Puritans, leaving England for the New World driven by the quest for religious freedom at a time when England was moving toward ardent Catholicism.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Scholar David B. Gracy, II, notes that some in the hierarchy of the King of England noticed the ''Bevis'' was almost entirely composed of Puritans and agents of the Kingdom sought to prevent the ship from setting sail in May 1638, but alas failed to prevent the sailing.&lt;ref&gt;"Crossing the Atlantic in 1638: Passengers aboard the Ship Bevis," The Second Boat, 1 (May 1980), 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savage, James.

==Notable passengers and comments on them==
[[Richard Austin (colonist)|Richard Austin]], whose descendants of the same surname name would include [[Moses Austin]], [[Stephen F. Austin]], and [[Emily Austin Perry]] who collectively are credited with settling the State of [[Texas]].

[[Rehoboth Carpenter family| William Carpenter from Shalbourne]] whose Rehoboth Carpenter family descendants included many politicians, generals, admirals and an astronaut. &lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Zubrinsky|Zubrinsky, Eugene Cole]], [[FASG]]. "The Family of William Carpenter of Rehoboth, Massachusetts, With the English Origin of the Rehoboth Carpenters," ''[[The American Genealogist]]'', Vol. 70 (October 1995), pp. 193-204. This work establishes the English origin of William Carpenter (Gen. 1) of Rehoboth (c1605-1658[/9]); identifies his wife, Abigail Briant; and revises their children's birth order.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dummer]], who had previously emigrated in 1632 as an organizer of and investor in the failed [[Lygonia|Plough Company (Lygonia Providence)]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Banks, Colonel Alexander Rigby: Proprietor of the Plough Patent and President of the Province of Lygonia (1885). (Privately printed; Collections Maine Historical Society) James Phinney Baxter, George Cleeve of Casco Bay 1630-1667 (The Gorges Society, 1885)&lt;/ref&gt; Dummer had returned to Hampshire, England, about 1637 and, as a Bevis passenger, was bringing relatives back to New England with him. The following excerpt is from [[Eugene Zubrinsky|Eugene Cole Zubrinsky's]] online sketch of "William2 Carpenter of Rehoboth" which indicates an indirect connection between Dummer and the Carpenters:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"The Bevis passenger list describes William2 and his father as “of Horwell,” that is, Whorwell (now Wherwell), in Horwell Hundred, Hampshire, about 15 miles south-south-east of Shalbourne. Wherwell, which had a tradition of religious dissent—at least two of its vicars, Stephen Bachiler (1587–1605)&lt;ref&gt;The son of [[Stephen Bachiler]] (23 June 1561 - 28 October 1656)&lt;/ref&gt; and his probable brother-in-law John Bate (1605–1633), were nonconformists—lies on a straight line from Shalbourne to the Bevis’s port of departure, at Southampton. (Another Bevis passenger in 1638 was Richard Dummer, who, with kinsman Bachiler, had been a partner in the Plough Company, which had recruited dissenters for migration to New England in 1631 and 1632.) It is clear from the chronology of Carpenter records at Shalbourne that the family was at Wherwell for a few months at most. It is indeed possible that they paused there only long enough to obtain from sympathetic authorities the certificates of conformity (one for each man) that customs officials would require for the Carpenters to leave England and from which the residence recorded for them on the passenger list was probably copied (TAG 70:193–94, 195n14; NEHGR 14:336; Old Hampshire Maps; see also “Focus on the Planter,” GMN 15, no. 4)."&lt;ref&gt;Zubrinsky, Eugene Cole, FASG.

'''Bohumil Doležal''' (born January 17, 1940), is a [[Czech people|Czech]] literary critic, politician and former dissident. He was a political advisor to [[Václav Klaus]], the former Czech prime minister.

Doležal was born in [[Prague]], and graduated in 1962 after studying [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[German language|German]] at [[Charles University]]. He wrote literary critiques for the magazine ''Tvář'' from 1964 to 1965, when the magazine was cancelled. He later wrote for the magazine after its revival in 1968, made possible by the [[Prague spring]], until 1969 when ''Tvář'' was cancelled again. He first met Václav Klaus in 1968.

For the next twenty years, he worked as a technician and programmer. He signed [[Charter 77]] and was a founding member of the Czechoslovakian Helsinki Committee.

After the [[Velvet revolution]] of 1989, he was co-opted to the federal chamber of the Czechoslovakian parliament. Later he was elected to the chamber. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psp.cz/eknih/1990fs/sn/usneseni/u0004.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1992-1993 he worked as the chief political advisor to [[Václav Klaus]] (then prime minister of the [[Czech and Slovak Federative Republic]] and after its peaceful split, prime minister of the [[Czech Republic]]). After a difference of opinion with Klaus, Doležal moved into academia and started teaching politics and "the history of political thinking" in the Faculty of Social Sciences at Charles University. In addition, he is a well-known activist and supporter of Czech-German reconciliation. His opinions are close to that of [[Federation of Expellees|German expellees organizations]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ce-review.org/01/16/odsun16.html]&lt;/ref&gt; His writing is also published in various Czech printed and electronic media.

'''Chester Bomar Himes''' (July 29, 1909 – November 12, 1984) was a black American writer. His works include ''[[If He Hollers Let Him Go]]'' and the [[Harlem Detective]] series. In 1958 he won France's [[Grand Prix de Littérature Policière]].

==Life==

=== Early life ===
Chester Himes was born in [[Jefferson City]], [[Missouri]], on July 29, 1909, to Joseph Sandy Himes and Estelle Bomar Himes; his father was a [[nomad|peripatetic]] [[historically black colleges and universities|black college]] professor of industrial trades and his mother was a teacher at [[Barber-Scotia College#Scotia Seminary|Scotia Seminary]] prior to marriage;&lt;ref name=himes&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chester Himes grew up in a middle-class home in Missouri. When he was about 12 years old, his father took a teaching job in the [[Arkansas Delta]] at Branch Normal College (now [[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]]), and soon a tragedy took place that would profoundly shape Himes's view of race relations. He had misbehaved and his mother made him sit out a gunpowder demonstration that he and his brother, Joseph Jr., were supposed to conduct during a school assembly. Working alone, Joseph mixed the chemicals; they exploded in his face. Rushed to the nearest hospital, the blinded boy was refused treatment because of [[Jim Crow laws]]. "That one moment in my life hurt me as much as all the others put together," Himes wrote in ''The Quality of Hurt''.

{{quote|I loved my brother. I had never been separated from him and that moment was shocking, shattering, and terrifying....We pulled into the emergency entrance of a white people's hospital. White clad doctors and attendants appeared. I remember sitting in the back seat with Joe watching the pantomime being enacted in the car's bright lights. A white man was refusing; my father was pleading. Dejectedly my father turned away; he was crying like a baby. My mother was fumbling in her handbag for a handkerchief; I hoped it was for a pistol.}}

The family later settled in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. His parents' marriage was unhappy and eventually ended in divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/chimes.htm |title=Chester Himes |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208073634/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/chimes.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prison and literary beginnings ===
Himes's family left Pine Bluff and relocated to Cleveland, Ohio, where he attended [[East High School (Cleveland, Ohio)|East High School]]. He attended [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]], where he became a member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web

  |quote=Chester Himes, Kappa, (Ohio State University), Author }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was expelled for playing a prank. In late 1928 he was arrested and sentenced to jail and hard labor for 20 to 25 years for [[armed robbery]] and sent to [[Ohio Penitentiary]]. In prison, he wrote short stories and had them published in national magazines. He stated that [[Prison literature in the United States|writing in prison]] and being published was a way to earn respect from guards and fellow inmates, as well as to avoid violence.

His first stories appeared in 1931 in ''[[The Bronzeman]]'' and, starting in 1934, in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''. His story "To What Red Hell" (published in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' in 1934) as well as to his novel ''Cast the First Stone'' – only much later republished unabridged as ''[[Yesterday Will Make You Cry]]'' (1998) – dealt with the catastrophic prison fire Himes witnessed at [[Ohio Penitentiary]] in 1930.

In 1934 Himes was transferred to [[London Correctional Institution|London Prison Farm]] and in April 1936 was released on parole into his mother's custody. Following his release he worked at part-time jobs while continuing to write. During this period he came into contact with [[Langston Hughes]], who facilitated Himes's contacts with the world of literature and publishing.

In 1936 Himes married Jean Johnson.

=== First books ===
In the 1940s Himes spent time in Los Angeles, working as a screenwriter but also producing two novels, ''[[If He Hollers Let Him Go]]'' and ''[[The Lonely Crusade]]'', that charted the experiences of the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|wave of black in-migrants]], drawn by the city's defense industries, and their dealings with the established black community, fellow workers, unions and management. He also provided an analysis of the [[Zoot Suit Riots]] for ''[[The Crisis]]'', the magazine of the [[NAACP]].

[[Mike Davis (scholar)|Mike Davis]] in ''[[City of Quartz|City of Quartz: Excavating the Future of Los Angeles]]'', describing the prevalence of racism in Hollywood in the 1940s and '50s, cites Himes' brief career as a screenwriter for [[Warner Brothers]], terminated when [[Jack L. Warner]] heard about him and said: "I don't want no niggers on this lot."&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Mike. ''City of Quartz''. Verso, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CNkDAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=niggers#search_anchor 43].&lt;/ref&gt; Himes later wrote in his autobiography:

{{quote|Up to the age of thirty-one I had been hurt emotionally, spiritually and physically as much as thirty-one years can bear. I had lived in the [[Southern United States|South]], I had fallen down an elevator shaft, I had been kicked out of college, I had served seven and one half years in prison, I had survived the humiliating last five years of [[Great Depression in the United States|Depression]] in Cleveland; and still I was entire, complete, functional; my mind was sharp, my reflexes were good, and I was not bitter. But under the mental corrosion of race prejudice in Los Angeles I became bitter and saturated with hate.}}

=== Emigration to France ===
By the 1950s Himes had decided to settle permanently in France, a country he liked in part due to his popularity in literary circles. In [[Paris]], Himes was the contemporary of the political cartoonist [[Oliver Harrington]] and fellow [[expatriate]] writers [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], and [[William Gardner Smith]].

It was in Paris in the late 1950s that Chester met his second wife Lesley Packard, when she went to interview him.  She was a journalist at the ''[[International Herald Tribune|Herald Tribune]]'', where she wrote her own fashion column, "Monica". He described her as "Irish-English with blue-gray eyes and very good looking"; he also saw her courage and resilience, Chester said to Lesley, "You're the only true color-blind person I've ever met in my life."&lt;ref name=LeslieHimes_GuardainObit&gt;{{cite web|last1=Priozek|first1=Sarah|title=Lesley Himes obituary|work= [[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/jul/07/lesley-himes-obituary|date=July 7, 2010|accessdate=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he suffered a stroke, in 1959, Lesley quit her job and nursed him back to health. She cared for him for the rest of his life, and worked with him as his informal editor, proofreader, confidante and, as the director [[Melvin Van Peebles|Van Peebles]] dubbed her, "his watchdog". After a long engagement, they were married in 1978.&lt;ref name=LeslieHimes_GuardainObit /&gt;

Lesley and Chester faced adversities as a [[Mixed race relationships|mixed-race couple]] but they prevailed. Theirs was a life lived with an unparallelled passion and great humor.&lt;ref name=LeslieHimes_GuardainObit /&gt; Their circle of political colleagues and creative friends included not only such towering figures as Langston Hughes and Richard Wright; it also included figures such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Carl Van Vechten]], [[Picasso]], [[Jean Miotte]], [[Ollie Harrington]], [[Nikki Giovanni]] and [[Ishmael Reed]]. Bohemian life in Paris would in turn lead them to the South of France and finally on to Spain, where they lived until Chester's death in 1984.

=== Later life and death ===
In 1969 Himes moved to [[Moraira]], Spain, where he died in 1984 from [[Parkinson's disease]]. He is buried at [[Benissa]] cemetery.

== Critical reception and biography ==
Some regard Chester Himes as the literary equal of [[Dashiell Hammett]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and [[Raymond Chandler]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Ishmael Reed says "[Himes] taught me the difference between a black detective and [[Sherlock Holmes]]" and it would be more than 30 years until another Black mystery writer, [[Walter Mosley]] and his [[Easy Rawlins]] and Mouse series, had even a similar effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/~sww/reed/reed_ishmael0.html Ishmael Reed by Spring&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], The Circle Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, his widow Lesley Himes went to New York to work with Ed Margolies on the first biographical treatment of Himes's life, entitled ''The Several Lives of Chester Himes'', by long-time Himes scholars [[Edward Margolies]] and [[Michel Fabre]], published in 1997 by [[University Press of Mississippi]]. Later, novelist and Himes scholar [[James Sallis]] published a more deeply detailed biography of Himes called ''Chester Himes: A Life'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Busby|Busby, Margaret]], [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/21/biography "Do the Harlem shuffle"], ''The Guardian'', 21 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed examination of Himes's writing and writings about him can be found in ''Chester Himes: An Annotated Primary and Secondary Bibliography'' compiled by Michel Fabre, Robert E. Skinner, and Lester Sullivan ([[Greenwood Press]], 1992).

In 2017, [[Lawrence P. Jackson]] published a significant, 600+ page biography of Himes titled ''Chester B.

Himes's novels encompassed many [[genre]]s including the crime novel/mystery and political polemics, exploring racism in the United States.

Chester Himes wrote about African Americans in general, especially in two books that are concerned with labor relations and African-American workplace issues. ''[[If He Hollers Let Him Go]]'' – which contains many autobiographical elements – is about a black [[shipyard]] worker in Los Angeles during [[World War II]] struggling against racism, as well as his own violent reactions to racism.  ''[[Lonely Crusade]]'' is a longer work that examines some of the same issues.

''Cast the First Stone'' (1952) is based on Himes's experiences in prison. It was Himes's first novel but was not published until about ten years after it was written. One reason may have been Himes' unusually candid treatment – for that time – of a homosexual relationship. Originally written in the third person, it was rewritten in the first person in a more "hard-boiled" style. ''Yesterday Will Make You Cry'' (1993), published after Himes's death, restored the original manuscript.

Himes also wrote a series of [[Harlem Detective]] novels featuring [[Coffin Ed Johnson]] and [[Gravedigger Jones]], New York City police detectives in [[Harlem]]. The novels feature a mordant emotional timbre and a fatalistic approach to street situations. [[Funeral home]]s are often part of the story, and funeral director [[H. Exodus Clay]] is a recurring character in these books.

The titles of the series include ''[[A Rage in Harlem (novel)|A Rage in Harlem]]'', ''[[The Real Cool Killers]]'', ''[[The Crazy Kill]]'', ''[[All Shot Up]]'', ''[[The Big Gold Dream]]'', ''The Heat's On'', ''[[Cotton Comes to Harlem (novel)|Cotton Comes to Harlem]]'', and ''[[Blind Man with a Pistol]]''; all written between 1957–1969.

''[[Cotton Comes to Harlem (film)|Cotton Comes to Harlem]]'' was made into a movie in 1970, which was set in that time period, rather than the earlier period of the original book. A sequel, ''[[Come Back, Charleston Blue]]'', was released in 1972, and ''For Love of Imabelle'' was made into a film under the title ''[[A Rage in Harlem (film)|A Rage in Harlem]]'' in 1991.

In May 2011, [[Penguin Modern Classics]] in London republished five of Himes' detective novels from the Harlem Cycle.

'''Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CMG|CBE}} (19 April 1909 &amp;ndash; 15 February 1974), known as '''Hugh Alexander''' and '''C. H. O'D. Alexander''' as a [[pen name]], was an [[Ireland|Irish]]-born [[United Kingdom|British]] [[cryptanalyst]], [[chess]] player, and chess writer. He worked on the German [[Enigma machine]] at [[Bletchley Park]] during the [[Second World War]], and was later the head of the [[cryptanalysis]] division at [[GCHQ]] for 25 years. In chess, he was twice [[British chess champion]] and earned the title of [[International Master]].

==Early life==
Hugh Alexander was born into an [[Anglo-Irish]] family on 19 April 1909 in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Ireland]], the eldest child of Conel William Long Alexander, an [[engineering]] professor at [[University College, Cork]] (UCC), and Hilda Barbara Bennett.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;Harry Golombek, revised by Ralph Erskine, "Alexander, (Conel) Hugh O'Donel (1909-1974), chess player and cryptanalyst" in the [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; His father died in 1920 (during the [[Irish War of Independence]]), and the family moved to [[Birmingham]] in [[England]] where he attended [[King Edward's School, Birmingham|King Edward's School]].&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; He won a scholarship to study [[mathematics]] at [[King's College, Cambridge]], in 1928, graduating with a first in 1931.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; He represented [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] in chess.

From 1932, he taught mathematics at [[Winchester College|Winchester]], and married Enid Constance Crichton Neate (1900–1982) on 22 December 1934.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; Their elder son was [[Michael Alexander (diplomat)|Sir Michael O'Donel Bjarne Alexander]] (1936–2002), a diplomat. His other son was [[Patrick Alexander (poet)|Patrick Macgillicuddy Alexander]] (20 March 1940 – 21 September 2005), a poet who settled in Australia in 1960. In 1938, Hugh Alexander left teaching and became head of research at the [[John Lewis Partnership]].&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

==Bletchley Park and GCHQ==

In February 1940, Alexander arrived at [[Bletchley Park]], the British codebreaking centre during the [[Second World War]]. He joined [[Hut 6]], the section tasked with breaking [[Germany|German]] [[Army]] and [[Air Force]] [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] messages. In 1941, he transferred to [[Hut 8]], the corresponding hut working on [[Naval Enigma]]. He became deputy head of Hut 8 under [[Alan Turing]]. Alexander was more involved with the day-to-day operations of the hut than Turing, and, while Turing was visiting the [[United States]], Alexander formally became the head of Hut 8 around November 1942. Other senior colleagues included [[Stuart Milner-Barry]], [[Gordon Welchman]], and [[Harry Golombek]]. In October 1944, Alexander was transferred to work on the [[Japan]]ese [[JN-25]] code.

In mid-1946, Alexander joined [[GCHQ]] (under the control of the [[Foreign Office]]), which was the post-war successor organisation to the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]] at Bletchley Park. By 1949, he had been promoted to the head of "Section H" ([[cryptanalysis]]), a post he retained until his retirement in 1971. 

[[MI5]]'s [[Peter Wright]], in his 1987 best-selling book ''Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer'', wrote about Alexander's assistance to MI5 in the ongoing [[Venona]] project, as well as other important mutual cooperation between the two organizations, which broke down previous barriers to progress. "Any help is gratefully received in this department", Alexander told Wright, and that proved the case from then on. Wright also lauded Alexander's professionalism, and opined that the exceptional mental demands of his cryptanalytical career and chess hobby likely contributed to Alexander's early death at age 64, despite his healthy lifestyle.

==Chess career==
[[File:Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander.jpg|thumb|302px|left|C. H. O'D. Alexander]]
He represented [[Cambridge University]] in the Varsity chess matches of 1929, 1930, 1931 and 1932 (he studied at [[King's College, Cambridge]]). He was twice a winner of the [[British Chess Championship]], in 1938 and 1956. He represented England in the [[Chess Olympiad]] six times, in 1933, 1935, 1937, 1939, 1954 and 1958. At the 1939 Olympiad in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], Alexander had to leave part-way through the event, along with the rest of the English team, because of the declaration of [[World War II]], since he was required at home for codebreaking duties. He was also the non-playing captain of England from 1964 to 1970. He was awarded the [[International Master]] title in 1950 and the International Master for [[Correspondence Chess]] title in 1970. He won [[Hastings International Chess Congress|Hastings]] 1946/47 with the score 7½/9, a point ahead of [[Savielly Tartakower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Sunnucks | first=Anne | author-link=Anne Sunnucks | year=1970 | title=The Encyclopaedia of Chess | publisher=St. Martin's Pres | page=184 | lccn=78106371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rogerpaige.me.uk/Tables%2017.htm Hastings 1946/47 crosstable] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215941/http://www.rogerpaige.me.uk/Tables%2017.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His best tournament result may have been first equal (with [[David Bronstein]]) at Hastings 1953/54, where he went undefeated and beat Soviet grandmasters [[David Bronstein]] and [[Alexander Tolush]] in individual games. Alexander's opportunities to appear abroad were limited as he was not allowed to play chess in the [[Soviet bloc]] because of his secret work in cryptography.&lt;ref name="Hooper&amp;Whyld"&gt;{{citation | last1=Hooper | first1=David | author1-link=David Vincent Hooper | last2=Whyld | first2=Kenneth | author2-link=Kenneth Whyld | year=1992 | title=[[The Oxford Companion to Chess]] | edition=2 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-280049-3| page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the chess columnist of ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' in the 1960s and 1970s.

Many knowledgeable chess people believe that Alexander had [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] potential, had he been able to develop his chess abilities further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=In Memoriam: Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|author=Hugh Denham|publisher=NSA|date=October 1974|accessdate=11 October 2015|url=https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_spectrum/in_memoriam.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026030014/https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_spectrum/in_memoriam.pdf|archivedate=26 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many top players peak in their late twenties and early thirties, but for Alexander this stretch coincided with World War II, when high-level competitive opportunities were unavailable. After this, his professional responsibilities as a senior cryptanalyst limited his top-class appearances. He defeated [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] in one game of a team radio match against the [[Soviet Union]] in 1946, at a time when Botvinnik was probably the world's top player. Alexander made important theoretical contributions to the [[Dutch Defence]] and [[Petroff Defence]].

== In popular culture ==

Alexander is portrayed by actor [[Matthew Goode]] in the 2014 film ''[[The Imitation Game]]'', which depicts the British attempts to crack the Enigma machine at Bletchley Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farndale|first1=Nigel|title=The Imitation Game: who were the real Bletchley Park codebreakers?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/07/31/the-imitation-game-who-were-the-real-bletchley-park-codebreakers/|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Darryl L. Foster''' is an American activist, author and [[Minister (Christianity)|Christian minister]]. He began his ministry in the [[Church of God in Christ]] (COGIC), a fringe [[Christian denomination]]. An advocate of [[gay conversion]], he founded, and is executive director of. Witness Freedom Ministries, which targets men and women seeking to change their [[sexual orientation]] and refrain from [[same-sex relationships]]. 

== Biography ==
=== Early Years ===
Foster was born into a family of Church of God in Christ preachers. His father was a pastor in the denomination, as was his grandfather, Ezekiel Foster, Sr whom he acknowledges as a major influence in his life. Foster was raised in [[Marlin, Texas]], until his graduation where he enlisted in military service in 1982.&lt;!--Which branch? It can be inferred that it was the Army, but sourced clarification would be nice.--&gt;

=== Education ===
After graduating from Marlin High School in 1980, Foster enrolled in [[McClennan Community College]] at Waco to study journalism and mass communications in hopes of landing a career as a media writer. While there, he served as the News Editor for the school's official paper, The Highland Herald. After a spending a decade in military service, Foster begin pursuing theology and enrolled in [[Liberty University]]'s External Degree Program. He completed a course in "Faith Writing" offered by [[Baylor University]] and taught by writer William Mattox, Jr. Later, he studied theology at [[Atlanta Bible College]], but withdrew after a year because of doctrinal concerns with the school's denominational affiliation.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== Military service ==
Foster served in various infantry and combat support units at [[Fort Campbell, KY]], [[Fort Benning, GA]], and [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]], Germany. He served in Operation Big Pine II in Honduras, 1983 and served as a [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|US Chief of Staff]] driver during a year's tour with the [[Multinational Force and Observers]] (MFO) in El Gorah Egypt from 1984-1985. In August 1991, his Fort Benning based unit deployed to [[Operation Desert Storm]]. Foster was the recipient of numerous service medals and honors including the Army [[Achievement Medal]] (2nd OLC), the [[Joint Service Commendation Medal]] and the rare [[Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia)|Kuwait Liberation Medal]] presented by the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]]. Foster was honorably discharged in May 1992.

== Ministry ==
In his public testimonies, Foster has described himself as living as a [[gay]] man, until becoming a [[born-again Christian]] in 1990.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The following year, he became a licensed minister in COGIC. He eventually "came out" as having lived as a homosexual male in the past, publicizing his testimony in the denomination, on a [[Public-access television|public-access]] cable channel in [[Waco, Texas]]. He gained national prominence when the Christian magazine ''[[Charisma]]'' featured him in the 1998 cover story entitled "Let's Stop Hiding From the Pain".

He founded Witness Freedom Ministries in Waco in 1996 and began developing programs to reach and assist Christian men and women with their personal struggles with sexuality. A conference was launched in 1998, and in 1999 Foster relocated the ministry to [[Atlanta, Georgia]] with a specific focus on people of color.

In 1998, he became associated with the ex-gay movement [[Exodus International]]. He became one of the few prominent [[African American]] leaders in the ex-gay movement. Foster and other leaders of the movement defend their outreaches as part of the church's mission to provide help to people who "struggle" with homosexuality.

He founded the Restoration Sanctuary Church in [[Forest Park, Georgia]], where he served as pastor from 2001–2008.  The church was later renamed Praise Power Ministries.

=== Activism ===
In June 2007, Foster launched Gay Christian Movement Watch, a controversial [[blog]] which began calling attention to the "gay christian movement".

In September 2009, Foster launched Report COGIC Abuse, a second website which called attention to cases of [[clergy sexual abuse]] in his former denomination. Foster contended the church's leadership was turning a blind eye to the sexual abuse of children. The site stirred considerable resistance from leaders of the denomination, including [[Bishop Charles Blake]], the church's Presiding Bishop. Blake told the ''Memphis Commercial Appeal'', ""Brother Foster has a flavor of the year he usually focuses on. His flavor this year is sexual harassment and sexual abuse."

Blake said the attention the site has received is out of proportion, considering the thousands of COGIC leaders. "Thirty allegations of sexual misbehavior is too many, but it should be looked at in that context," he said.

== Writings ==
Foster chronicled his 11 years of homosexual experiences in the semiautubiographical ''Touching A Dead Man: One Man's Explosive Story of Deliverance from Homosexuality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Touching A Dead Man: One Man's Explosive Story of Deliverance from Homosexuality|format=E-book|first=Darryl|last=Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Puttnam was appointed as a [[Commander of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=49212 |date=30 December 1982 |page=9 |supp=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Puttnam was appointed as a [[Knight Bachelor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=53893 |date=30 December 1994 |page=2| supp=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Puttnam was created as a [[life peer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=54851 |date=1 August 1997 |page=8910}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was granted Letters Patent to become '''Baron Puttnam''', of Queensgate in the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 54934| date=30 October 1997 |page=12205}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Puttnam was named in a list of financial donors to the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/161057.stm | title= 'Luvvies' for Labour | work=BBC News | date=30 August 1998 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, he chaired the joint scrutiny committee on the [[Communications Act 2003|Communications Bill]], which recommended an amendment to prevent ownership of British terrestrial TV stations by companies with a significant share of the newspaper market. This was widely interpreted as being aimed at stopping [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation]] from buying channel [[Five (channel)|Five]]. When the government opposed the amendment, Puttnam brokered a compromise – the introduction of a "public interest" test to be applied by the new regulator [[Ofcom]], but without explicit restrictions.

From 2004 to 2005, Puttnam chaired the [[Hansard Society]] Commission on Communication of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]ary Democracy, the final report of which urged all political parties to commit to a renewal of parliamentary life in an attempt to reinvigorate representative democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/may/24/uk.media|title=Puttnam urges parliament to modernise|author=White, Michael|date=24 May 2005|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-04106.pdf House of Commons Library – Standard Note – The Puttnam (Hansard Society) Commission: Members Only?

A business that can combine and magnify these dynamics can only create incredible value for their clients and, as a by-product, themselves. To me Profero is in just such a position, and it's now my job to help them realise their potential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lord Puttnam becomes chairman of Profero |url=http://dmweekly.mad.co.uk/Main/Home/Articlex/c07d7c1d21ff40c886c082e22f34215c/Lord-Puttnam-becomes-chairman-of-Profero.html |work=MAD |date=16 April 2007 |accessdate=13 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106122254/http://dmweekly.mad.co.uk/Main/Home/Articlex/c07d7c1d21ff40c886c082e22f34215c/Lord-Puttnam-becomes-chairman-of-Profero.html |archivedate=6 January 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Euphemia Chalmers Millais, Lady Millais''' (''née'' '''Gray'''; 7 May 1828 – 23 December 1897) was the wife of  [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] painter [[John Everett Millais]]. She had previously been married to the critic [[John Ruskin]], but the marriage was annulled, and she left him without the marriage having been consummated. Her husband Millais was Ruskin's protégé. This famous Victorian "[[love triangle]]" has been dramatised in plays, films and an opera. 

She was also an artist and an author for ''Effie in Venice: Unpublished Letters of Mrs. John Ruskin Written from Venice Between 1849 - 1852'' and ''Selling Light'', first published in 2008.

==Early life==
Euphemia Chalmers Gray, initially known by the pet name of "Phemy", later as "Effie," was born on 7 May 1828 to Sophia Margaret Gray and George Gray in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Perthshire]], [[Scotland]].  She had a sister named Sophy Gray.

==Relationship with John Ruskin and John Everett Millais==
[[File:Gray millais 1865.jpg|thumbnail|Albumen print photograph by [[Lewis Carroll]] from 21 July 1865 depicting Effie Gray, [[John Everett Millais]], and their daughters Effie and Mary at 7 Cromwell Place, signed "Effie C. Millais".]]
Gray's family knew Ruskin's father, and they encouraged a match between Ruskin and Gray. Ruskin wrote the fantasy novel ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' for her in 1841, when she was twelve years old. After their marriage in 1848,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Order of Release: The Story of John Ruskin, Effie Gray and John Everett Millais Told for the First Time in their Unpublished Letters|year=1948|publisher=J.

In England they lived in Bowerswell, the house where Ruskin's grandfather had killed himself by cutting his throat in 1817.&lt;ref name="Garnett2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henrietta Garnett|title=Wives and Stunners: The Pre-Raphaelites and Their Muses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xshaKqrZClAC&amp;pg=PP227|date=30 August 2012|publisher=Pan Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-76754-6|pages=227–etc}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Their different personalities were thrown into sharp relief by their contrasting priorities. For Effie, Venice provided an opportunity to socialise while Ruskin was engaged in solitary studies. In particular, he made a point of drawing the [[Ca' d'Oro]] and the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Palazzo Ducale]] (Doge’s Palace), because he feared they would soon be destroyed by the occupying Austrian troops. One of the troops, Lieutenant Charles Paulizza, made friends with Effie, apparently with no objection from Ruskin. Her brother, among others, later claimed that Ruskin was deliberately encouraging the friendship to compromise her, as an excuse to separate.

When she met Millais five years later, she was still a virgin, as Ruskin had persistently put off [[consummate|consummating]] the marriage. His reasons are unclear, but they involved disgust with some aspect of her body. As she later wrote to her father,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"He alleged various reasons, hatred to children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and, finally this last year he told me his true reason...  that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening."''&lt;ref name="Hewison1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Hewison|title=John Ruskin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1XjntfarTykC&amp;pg=PA201|year=1979|publisher=Ardent Media|pages=201–202|id=GGKEY:8PSQ7NGSATA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruskin confirmed this in his statement to his lawyer during the annulment proceedings: "It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it."&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens, M., ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p.191&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for Ruskin's disgust with "circumstances in her person" is unknown. Various suggestions have been made, including revulsion at either her pubic hair,&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Rose (1983) ''Parallel Lives''; Franny Moyle (2009) ''Desperate Romantics''&lt;/ref&gt; or menstrual blood.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'', Chatto &amp; Windus, 1988, pp.11–12; [[Suzanne Fagence Cooper]] (2010) ''The Model Wife: The Passionate Lives of Effie Gray, Ruskin and Millais''&lt;/ref&gt; However, Robert Brownell, in his analysis ''Marriage of Inconvenience'', argues that Ruskin's difficulty with the marriage was financial and related to concerns that Effie and her less-affluent family were trying to tap into Ruskin's considerable wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/29/ruskin-effie-marriage-inconvenience-brownell|first = Michael|last = Prodger|date = 2013-03-29|accessdate = 2015-03-24|title = John Ruskin's marriage: What really happened|magazine = Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Millais Waterfall 1935-53.jpg|thumb|''Waterfall'', or ''Effie at Glenfinlas'', 1853, by Millais]]
While married to Ruskin, she modelled for Millais' painting ''[[The Order of Release]]'', in which she was depicted as the loyal wife of a Scottish rebel who has secured his release from prison. She then became close to Millais when he accompanied the couple on a trip to Scotland in order to paint Ruskin's portrait according to the critic's artistic principles. During this time, spent in [[Brig o' Turk]] in the [[Trossachs]], they fell in love. While working on the portrait of her husband, Millais made many drawings and sketches of her. He also sent humorous cartoons of himself, Effie and Ruskin to friends. She copied some of his works.

After their return to London, she left Ruskin, nominally to visit her family. She sent back her wedding ring with a note announcing her intention to file for an [[annulment]]. With the support of her family and a number of influential friends, she successfully pursued the case, causing a major public scandal, and their marriage was annulled on the grounds of 'incurable impotency' in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;National Records of Scotland, Annulment recorded in Kinnoull Kirk Session Minutes (NRS ref. CH2/948/7), 1854, pp.223–227.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, she married John Millais and eventually bore him eight children: Everett, born in 1856; George, born in 1857; Effie, born in 1858; Mary, born in 1860; Alice, born in 1862; Geoffroy, born in 1863; John in 1865; and Sophie in 1868. Their youngest son, [[John Guille Millais]], was a notable bird artist and gardener. She also modelled for a number of her husband's works, notably ''[[Peace Concluded]]'' (1856), which idealises her as an icon of beauty and fertility.

When Ruskin later sought to become engaged to a teenage girl, [[Rose La Touche]], Rose's parents were concerned. They wrote to Gray to ask about the marriage; she replied by describing Ruskin as an oppressive husband. The engagement was broken off.

==Influence on Millais==
[[File:EFFIE.jpg|thumb|200px|Gray in middle age, painted by Millais. She is holding a copy of the ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]''.]]
After his marriage, Millais began to paint in a broader style, which Ruskin condemned as a "catastrophe".  Marriage had given him a large family to support, and it is claimed{{who|date=December 2010}} that his wife encouraged him to churn out popular works for financial gain and to maintain her busy social life. However, there is no evidence that she consciously pressured him to do so, though she was an effective manager of his career and often collaborated with him in choosing subjects. Her journal indicates her high regard for her husband's art, and his works are still recognisably Pre-Raphaelite in style several years after his marriage.

However, Millais eventually abandoned the Pre-Raphaelite obsession with detail and began to paint in a looser style which produced more paintings for the time and effort. Many paintings were inspired by his family life with his wife, often using his children and grandchildren as models. Millais also used his sister-in-law, [[Sophy Gray (Pre-Raphaelite muse)|Sophy Gray]], then in her early teens, as the basis of some striking images in the mid to late 1850s, provoking suggestions of a mutual infatuation.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Fagence Cooper (2010) ''The Model Wife: The Passionate Lives of Effie Gray, Ruskin and Millais''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:Euphemia Millais Gray.jpg|thumb|Euphemia Millais Gray, Perth, Scotland]]
The [[annulment]] from Ruskin barred her from events at which [[Queen Victoria]] was present. Both she and her husband were considerably bothered, as she had been socially very active, although many in society were still prepared to receive her and to press her case sympathetically.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Fagence Cooper (2010) ''The Model Wife: The Passionate Lives of Effie Gray, Ruskin and Millais''&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, when Millais was dying, the Queen relented through the intervention of her daughter [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]], allowing Gray to attend an official function. Sixteen months after Millais' death, Effie died at Bowerswell on 23 December 1897&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFKRlPTPTKkC&amp;pg=PA251|title=The Order of Release – The Story of John Ruskin, Effie Gray and John Everett Millias|first=W.|last=James|isbn=978-1-4437-0293-5|publisher=Read|year=2008|page=251|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried in Kinnoull churchyard, Perth, which is depicted in Millais's painting ''The Vale of Rest''.

[[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] '''Eric George William Warde Harrison''', [[Companion of the Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Military Cross|MC]], (23 March 1893 – 20 December 1987) was a [[British Army]] officer who served in both world wars, a rugby player, Olympic athlete, and later a painter and author.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;Davies (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
Harrison was born in [[Belgaum]], India;&lt;ref name="ggg"&gt;''Gunners, Game &amp; Gardens''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ha/eric-harrison-1.html|title=Eric Harrison|publisher=[[Sports Reference]]|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; his father, Major WC Warde Harrison, was an officer in the [[British Indian Army]].&lt;ref name="www"&gt;''Who Was Who''&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison was educated at [[Cheltenham College]] before entering [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]]. While at Woolwich he played competitive [[rugby union]] for the army and for [[Kent]] and was selected by [[Barbarian F.C.|the Barbarians]]. From Woolwich he was commissioned into the [[Royal Artillery]] as a [[second lieutenant]] in January 1914,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28794|page=500|date=20 January 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which he was invited to play football for [[Southend United F.C.]]. He took up [[hurdling]] and was soon selected to compete for England in the [[110 metres hurdles|120 metres hurdles]] against Scotland and Ireland.

===First World War===
At the outbreak of the [[First World War]] Harrison was posted first to [[Harwich]], manning anti-aircraft guns, and then to France, where he was involved in intense fighting around [[Hooge in World War I|Hooge]]. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant]] in June 1915,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29250|supp=y|page=7650|date=4 August 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; and awarded the [[Military Cross]] later that year "for gallantry and initiative at [[Battle of Givenchy|Givenchy]], on 10 March 1915, when he rushed up his gun under heavy shell fire and close-range rifle fire, and destroyed a hostile machine gun".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29131|supp=y|page=3694|date=15 April 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to fight at the [[Battle of Loos]]. He was promoted to temporary [[captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in November 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29874|supp=y|page=12452|date=21 December 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; a promotion which was made permanent a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30362|supp=y|page=11300|date=2 November 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918 he was promoted to [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] major,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30450|supp=y|page=12|date=1 January 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him the youngest officer in the army to hold the rank at the time, and given command of an infantry school before appointment as a general staff officer first grade. By the end of the First World War, Harrison was attached to the [[58th (London) Division]] and had been [[mentioned in dispatches]] four times.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30692|supp=y|page=5960|date=21 May 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between the wars===
Following the end of the war, Harrison resumed his sports careers. He was selected for the "Mother Country" [[rugby union|rugby]] team (forerunner to the [[British and Irish Lions]]) in 1919, and played for the army against Oxford University in 1920. Harrison's rugby career ended prematurely due to injury, after which he refocused on hurdling; he was selected for the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] but was prohibited from competing due to heart problems.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="www" /&gt; He was appointed master of the Royal Artillery Harriers and then selected for staff college. He went on to compete at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in Paris, and reached a semi-final in the [[Athletics at the 1924 Summer Olympics – Men's 110 metres hurdles|110 metres hurdles]].&lt;ref name="SportsRef"&gt;{{cite Sports-Reference |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ha/eric-harrison-1.html |title=Eric Harrison Olympic Results |accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Olympics, Harrison attended the [[Staff College, Camberley]]&lt;ref name="www" /&gt; from 1925 to 1926 and was appointed [[adjutant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33396|supp=y|page=4265|date=22 June 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33015|page=591|date=27 January 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Lahore District]], India, from 1928 to 1932.&lt;ref name="www" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33398|page=4416|date=29 June 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he became master of the Lahore Hunt and took up big game shooting and [[racquets (sport)|racquets]], in which he won the doubles event at the All India Championships. He returned to England in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33834|page=3789|date=10 June 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was promoted to permanent major.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33815|page=2293|date=8 April 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Harrison was appointed a battery commander at [[Catterick Garrison]] in Yorkshire. Here he began painting, and eventually had three of his works hung at [[Salon (Paris)|the Salon]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; Later that year, he was promoted to brevet [[lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]] and given command of the Oxford University Officer Training Corps (OTC)&lt;ref name="www" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34102|supp=y|page=7084|date=6 November 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lectured at the university on military history until he relinquished the post in 1938;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34561|page=6438|date=14 October 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also became master of the South Oxfordshire Hunt.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

In 1939, Harrison briefly served in [[Mandatory Palestine]], commanding an infantry battalion at the end of the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab Revolt]] under [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]], [[General Officer Commanding]] (GOC) [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Infantry Division]] and a former Staff College instructor, who remarked that, "having loosed 'Dreadnought Harrison' on the task of killing rebels [...] he needed no urging in this respect".&lt;ref&gt;Smart, p.140&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July 1939 Harrison was promoted to lieutenant colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34650|page=5312|date=1 August 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===
With the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in September 1939, Harrison returned to England and was appointed [[Commander, Royal Artillery]] (CRA) with the [[12th (Eastern) Division|12th (Eastern) Infantry Division]], based at [[Sevenoaks]] in Kent. Harrison was promoted to full [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] on 28 August 1939 (with seniority backdated to 1 January 1937),&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34684|page=6331|date=15 September 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on the same date, to the temporary rank of [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|brigadier]].&lt;ref name="www" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34684|page=6333|date=15 September 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th Division was sent overseas to France in April 1940 but left its artillery, and Harrison, behind. Severely mauled during the [[Battle of France]] the following month, the 12th Division was disbanded in July and Harrison became Brigadier, Royal Artillery (BRA) in [[HQ Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland District]] before being posted to Tunisia, where he served as Commander, Corps of Royal Artillery (CCRA) in [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Corps]], under, initially, [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[John Crocker]], and, from late April 1943, Lieutenant-General [[Brian Horrocks]]. After the end of the campaign, Harrison was promoted to major general and served in [[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s [[Allied Force Headquarters|Allied Forces Headquarters]] (AFHQ) as Major General, Royal Artillery (MGRA); he was mentioned in despatches for his service during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] and continued in the post until 1943, when he returned to Britain to become [[General Officer Commanding]] (GOC) Sussex and Surrey District. Harrison was made a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) on 5 August 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36120|page=3521|date=3 August 1943|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was promoted on 4 December 1943 to acting major-general.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36293|supp=y|page=5525|date=21 December 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; His rank of major-general was made temporary on 4 December 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36934|page=857|date=9 February 1945|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was made a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in 1945, and appointed [[aide-de-camp]] to [[George VI|King George VI]] in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37326|supp=y|page=5263|date=26 October 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; and retired from the army on 28 May 1946, having been granted the honorary permanent rank of major general.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37580|supp=y|page=2547|date=28 May 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
In retirement, Harrison lived in [[Cornwall]]. He became master of the North Cornwall Hounds and was appointed [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of Cornwall in 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=40591|supp=y|page=5356|date=23 September 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[High Sheriff of Cornwall]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=41319|supp=y|page=1195|date=21 February 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as a [[justice of the peace]], and chairman of [[Hospital of St Lawrence, Bodmin|St Lawrence's mental hospital]] in [[Bodmin]]. In spare time, he grew [[rhododendron]]s and bred [[Labrador Retriever]]s, and fished for [[trout]]. He also published three books, including an autobiography, ''Gunners, Game &amp; Gardens''. His wife, Roza (née Stevenson), died in 1967. Harrison himself died in [[Amesbury]], Wiltshire, on 20 December 1987 at the age of 94.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SR" /&gt;

'''Francis Xavier''', [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|eɪ|v|i|ər|,_|ˈ|z|æ|v|i|-}}; born '''Francisco de Jasso y Azpilicueta'''; [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Franciscus Xaverius''; [[Basque language|Basque]]: ''Frantzisko Xabierkoa''; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Francisco Javier''; 7 April 1506{{snd}}3 December 1552), was a [[Navarre]]se [[Basques|Basque]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[missionary]], who was a co-founder of the [[Society of Jesus]].

Born in [[Javier, Spain|Javier]] (Xavier in [[Navarro-Aragonese]] or Xabier in [[Basque language|Basque]]), Kingdom of Navarre (in present day [[Spain]]), he was a companion of [[Saint Ignatius of Loyola]] and one of the first seven [[Jesuits]] who took vows of poverty and chastity at [[Montmartre]], [[Paris]], in 1534.&lt;ref&gt;Attwater (1965), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; He led an extensive mission into Asia, mainly in the [[Portuguese Empire]] of the time and was influential in [[evangelization]] work, most notably in India. The [[Goa Inquisition]] was proposed by St. Francis Xavier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In those areas, struggling to learn the local languages and in the face of opposition, he had less success than he had enjoyed in India. Xavier was about to extend his missionary preaching to China when he died on [[Shangchuan Island]].

He was beatified by [[Pope Paul V]] on 25 October 1619 and [[canonized]] by [[Pope Gregory XV]] on 12 March 1622. In 1624 he was made co-patron of Navarre&lt;!-- alongside Santiago --&gt;. Known as the "Apostle of the Indies" and "Apostle of Japan", he is considered to be one of the greatest missionaries since Saint Paul.{{sfn|De Rosa|2006|pp=90}} In 1927, [[Pope Pius XI]] published the decree "Apostolicorum in Missionibus" naming Saint Francis Xavier, along with Saint [[Thérèse of Lisieux]], co-patron of all foreign missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius11/P11APOST.htm |title= Apostolicorum in Missionibus|last1= Pope Pius XI|first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 14 December  1927 |website= Papal Encyclicals Online |publisher= |accessdate= 1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is now co-patron saint of Navarre with [[Fermin|San Fermin]]. The Day of Navarre (Día de Navarra) in Spain marks the anniversary of Saint Francis Xavier's death, on 3 December 1552.

==Early life==
[[File:Castillo javier.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Castle of Xavier|castle of the Xavier family]] was later acquired by the Society of Jesus.]]
Francis Xavier was born in the royal [[castle of Xavier]], in the [[Kingdom of Navarre]], on 7 April 1506 according to a family register. He was the youngest son of Juan de Jasso y Atondo, seneschal of Xavier castle, who belonged to a prosperous farming family and had acquired a doctorate in law at the [[University of Bologna]].{{sfn |Brodrick|1952|p=17}} Juan later became privy counsellor and finance minister to King John III of Navarre ([[Jean d'Albret]]).{{sfn |Brodrick|1952|p=18}} Francis's mother was Doña María de Azpilcueta y Aznárez, sole heiress of two noble Navarrese families. He was through her related to the great theologian and philosopher [[Martín de Azpilcueta]].{{sfn |Brodrick|1952|p=16}}

In 1512, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]], King of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and regent of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], invaded Navarre, initiating [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|a war that lasted over 18 years]]. Three years later, Francis's father died when Francis was only nine years old. In 1516, Francis's brothers participated in a failed Navarrese-French attempt to expel the Spanish invaders from the kingdom. The Spanish Governor, Cardinal Cisneros, confiscated the family lands, demolished the outer wall, the gates, and two towers of the family castle, and filled in the moat. In addition, the height of the keep was reduced by half.&lt;ref&gt;Sagredo Garde, Iñaki. ''Navarra. Castillos que defendieron el Reino''. Pamiela, 2006. {{ISBN|84-7681-477-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the family residence inside the castle was left. In 1522 one of Francis's brothers participated with 200 Navarrese nobles in dogged but failed resistance against the Castilian Count of Miranda in Amaiur, [[Baztan (valley)|Baztan]], the last Navarrese territorial position south of the Pyrenees.

In 1525, Francis went to study in Paris at the Collège Sainte-Barbe, [[University of Paris]], where he would spend the next eleven years.{{sfn |Brodrick|1952|p=28}} In the early days he acquired some reputation as an athlete{{sfn |Brodrick|1952|p=21}} and a high-jumper.{{sfn |Brodrick|1952|p=33}}

In 1529, Francis shared lodgings with his friend [[Pierre Favre]]. A new student, [[Ignatius of Loyola]], came to room with them.{{sfn |Brodrick|1952|p=40}} At 38, Ignatius was much older than Pierre and Francis, who were both 23 at the time. Ignatius convinced Pierre to become a priest, but was unable to convince Francis, who had aspirations of worldly advancement. At first Francis regarded the new lodger as a joke and was sarcastic about his efforts to convert students. {{sfn |Brodrick|1952|p=41}} When Pierre left their lodgings to visit his family and Ignatius was alone with Francis, he was able to slowly break down Francis's resistance.{{sfn |De Rosa|2006|p=93}} According to most biographies Ignatius is said to have posed the question: "What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"&lt;ref name=butler&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/STXAVIER.HTM |author=Butler, Rev. Alban |title=St Francis Xavier, Confessor, Apostle Of The Indies|work=The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints, Vol. III |publisher=ewtn.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[James Patrick Broderick|James Broderick]] such method is not characteristic of Ignatius and there is no evidence that he employed it at all.{{sfn|Brodrick|1952|p=41}}

In 1530 Francis received the degree of Master of Arts, and afterwards taught Aristotelian philosophy at Beauvais College, [[University of Paris]].{{sfn|Brodrick|1952|p=41}}

==Missionary work==
[[File:Saint Francis Xavier taking leave of King John III (1635) - José Avelar Rebelo.png|thumb|Francisco Xavier asking [[John III of Portugal]] for an expedition]]
[[File:StPierreParis.jpg|thumb|Church of [[Saint-Pierre de Montmartre]], Paris]]
On 15 August 1534, seven students met in a crypt beneath the Church of Saint Denis (now [[Saint Pierre de Montmartre]]), on the hill of [[Montmartre]], overlooking Paris. They were Francis, [[Ignatius of Loyola]], [[Alfonso Salmeron]], [[Diego Laynez|Diego Laínez]], [[Nicholas Bobadilla|Nicolás Bobadilla]] from Spain, [[Peter Faber]] from [[Savoy]], and [[Simão Rodrigues]] from [[Portugal]]. They made private vows of [[poverty, chastity, and obedience]] to the Pope, and also vowed to go to the Holy Land to convert infidels.{{sfn |De Rosa|2006|p=95}}{{sfn|Brodrick|1952|p=47}} Francis began his study of theology in 1534 and was ordained on 24 June 1537.

In 1539, after long discussions, Ignatius drew up a formula for a new religious order, the [[Society of Jesus]] (the Jesuits). {{sfn |De Rosa|2006|p=93}} Ignatius's plan for the order was approved by [[Pope Paul III]] in 1540.{{sfn |De Rosa|2006|p=37}}

In 1540 [[John III of Portugal|King John of Portugal]] had [[Pedro Mascarenhas]], Portuguese ambassador to the [[Holy See]], request Jesuit missionaries to spread the faith in his new possessions in India, where the king believed that Christian values were eroding among the Portuguese. After successive appeals to the Pope asking for missionaries for the [[East Indies]] under the [[Padroado]] agreement, John III was encouraged by [[Diogo de Gouveia]], rector of the Collège Sainte-Barbe, to recruit the newly graduated students that would establish the Society of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lach | first=Donald Frederick | authorlink=| year=1994 | title=Asia in the making of Europe: A century of wonder.

Ignatius promptly appointed  [[Nicholas Bobadilla]] and [[Simão Rodrigues]]. At the last moment, however, Bobadilla became seriously ill. With some hesitance and uneasiness, Ignatius asked Francis to go in Bobadilla's place. Thus, Francis Xavier began his life as the first Jesuit missionary almost accidentally.{{sfn |De Rosa|2006|p=96}}{{sfn |Brodrick|1952|p=77}}&lt;ref name=jack&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americancatholic.org/e-News/FriarJack/fj112906.asp |title=Wintz O.F.M., Jack, "St. Francis Xavier: Great Missionary to the Orient", Franciscan Media, November 29, 2006 |publisher=americancatholic.org |accessdate=6 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051732/http://www.americancatholic.org/e-News/FriarJack/fj112906.asp |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving Rome on 15 March 1540, in the Ambassador's train,{{sfn |Brodrick|1952|p=78}} Francis took with him a breviary, a catechism, and {{lang|la|De Institutione bene vivendi}} by [[Croatia]]n humanist [[Marko Marulić]],{{sfn |Brodrick|1952|p=96}} a Latin book that had become popular in the [[Counter-Reformation]]. According to a 1549 letter of F. Balthasar Gago from  Goa, it was the only book that Francis read or studied.&lt;ref name="Ante Kadič 1961 pp. 12-18"&gt;Ante Kadič. St. Francis Xavier and Marko Marulić. ''The Slavic and East European Journal'', Vol. 5, No. 1 (Spring, 1961), pp. 12–18&lt;/ref&gt; Francis reached Lisbon in June 1540 and, four days after his arrival, he and Rodrigues were summoned to a private audience with the King and the Queen.{{sfn |Brodrick|1952|p=85}}

Francis Xavier devoted much of his life to missions in Asia, mainly in four centres: Malacca, Amboina and Ternate, Japan, and China. His growing information about new places indicated to him that he had to go to what he understood were centres of influence for the whole region. China loomed large from his days in India. Japan was particularly attractive because of its culture. For him, these areas were interconnected; they could not be evangelised separately.&lt;ref name=japc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jceao.net/content/francis-xavier-founder-jesuit-mission-asia-our-inspiration-today|title=Zuloaga SJ, Ismael G., "Francis Xavier, Founder of the Jesuit Mission in Asia", Jesuit Asia Pacific Conference|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130413184233/http://jceao.net/content/francis-xavier-founder-jesuit-mission-asia-our-inspiration-today|archivedate=13 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goa and India===
Francis Xavier left [[Lisbon]] on 7 April 1541, his thirty-fifth birthday, along with two other Jesuits and the new [[viceroy]] [[Martim Afonso de Sousa]], on board the ''Santiago''.{{sfn |Brodrick|1952|p=100}} As he departed, Francis was given a brief from the pope appointing him [[apostolic nuncio]] to the East.&lt;ref name=jack/&gt; From August until March 1542 he remained in [[Portuguese Mozambique]], and arrived in [[Goa]], then capital of [[Portuguese India]], on 6 May 1542, thirteen months after leaving Lisbon.

The Portuguese, following quickly on the great voyages of discovery, had established themselves at Goa thirty years earlier. Francis's primary mission, as ordered by King John III, was to restore Christianity among the Portuguese settlers. According to Teotonio R. DeSouza, recent critical accounts indicate that apart from the posted civil servants, "the great majority of those who were dispatched as 'discoverers' were the riff-raff of Portuguese society, picked up from Portuguese jails." &lt;ref name="grupolusofona"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recil.grupolusofona.pt/jspui/bitstream/10437/509/1/PortuGoa.pdf |title= DeSouza, Teotonio R., "The Portuguese in Goa", Universidade Lusófona |publisher=recil.grupolusofona.pt|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor did the soldiers, sailors, or merchants come to do missionary work, and Imperial policy permitted the outflow of disaffected nobility. Many of the arrivals formed liaisons with local women and adopted Indian culture. Missionaries often wrote against the "scandalous and undisciplined" behaviour of their fellow Christians.&lt;ref name=Delio&gt;{{cite book|title=Conversions and Citizenry: Goa Under Portugal, 1510-1610|author=de Mendonça, D.|date=2002|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=9788170229605|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mh3kKf0VSfQC|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian population had churches, clergy, and a bishop, but there were few preachers and no priests beyond the walls of Goa. The Velliapura family of [[Velim, Goa]], of the [[St Thomas Christians]] sect, welcomed the  missionaries. Xavier decided that he must begin by instructing the Portuguese themselves, and gave much of his time to the teaching of children. The first five months he spent in preaching and ministering to the sick in the hospitals.&lt;ref name=Astrain&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06233b.htm |title=Astrain, Antonio.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 22 Mar. 2015 |publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, he walked through the streets ringing a bell to summon the children and servants to catechism.&lt;ref name=crawley/&gt; He was invited to head [[Saint Paul's College, Goa|Saint Paul's College]], a pioneer [[seminary]] for the education of secular priests, which became the first Jesuit headquarters in Asia.&lt;ref name="Archdiocese of Goa and Daman"&gt;{{cite web |last=Goa and Daman|first=Archdiocese of|title=St Paul's College &amp; Rachol Seminary|url=http://www.archgoadaman.org/content/st-pauls-college-rachol-seminary|work=website|publisher=Archdiocese of Goa and Daman|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Conversion of Paravas by Francis Xavier in 1542.jpg|thumb|left|Conversion of the [[Paravar]]s by Francis Xavier in [[South India]], in a 19th-century colored lithograph]]
Xavier soon learned that along the Pearl Fishery Coast, which extends from [[Cape Comorin]] on the southern tip of India to the island of [[Mannar, Sri Lanka|Mannar]], off Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]), there was a [[Jāti]] of people called Paravas. Many of them had been baptised ten years before, merely to please the Portuguese who had helped them against the Moors, but remained uninstructed in the faith. Accompanied by several native clerics from the seminary at Goa, he set sail for Cape Comorin in October 1542. He taught those who had already been baptised, and preached to those who weren't.

He devoted almost three years to the work of preaching to the people of southern India and Ceylon, converting many. He built nearly 40 churches along the coast, including [[St. Stephen's Church, Kombuthurai]], mentioned in his letters dated 1544.

During this time, he was able to visit the tomb of [[Thomas the Apostle]] in [[São Tomé de Meliapore|Mylapore]] (now part of Madras/[[Chennai]] then in Portuguese India).&lt;ref name=jack/&gt; He set his sights eastward in 1545 and planned a missionary journey to [[Makassar]] on the island of [[Sulawesi|Celebes]] (today's [[Indonesia]]).

As the first Jesuit in India, Francis had difficulty achieving much success in his missionary trips. His successors, such as de Nobili, [[Matteo Ricci]], and Beschi, attempted to convert the noblemen first as a means to influence more people, while Francis had initially interacted most with the lower classes; (later though, in Japan, Francis changed tack by paying tribute to the Emperor and seeking an audience with him).&lt;ref&gt;Duignan, Peter.

===South East Asia===
In the spring of 1545 Xavier started for [[Portuguese Malacca]]. He laboured there for the last months of that year. About January 1546, Xavier left Malacca for the [[Maluku Islands]], where the Portuguese had some settlements. For a year and a half he preached the Gospel there. He went first to [[Ambon Island]], where he stayed until mid-June. He then visited other Maluku Islands, including [[Ternate]], Baranura, and [[Morotai]].&lt;ref name=astrain&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06233b.htm |title= Astrain, Antonio.

===Japan and China===
{{main|History of Roman Catholicism in Japan}}
In Malacca in December 1547, Francis Xavier met a Japanese man named [[Anjirō]].&lt;ref name=astrain/&gt; Anjirō had heard of Francis in 1545 and had travelled from [[Kagoshima]] to Malacca to meet him. Having been charged with murder, Anjirō had fled Japan. He told Francis extensively about his former life, and the customs and culture of his homeland.  Anjirō became the first Japanese Christian and adopted the name of 'Paulo de Santa Fe'. He later helped Xavier as a mediator and interpreter for the mission to Japan that now seemed much more possible.

In January 1548 Francis returned to Goa to attend to his responsibilities as superior of the mission there.&lt;ref name=wintz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Dec2006/Feature2.asp#F4 |title=Four Great Spanish Saints - December 2006 Issue of St. Anthony Messenger Magazine Online |author=Wintz O.F.M., Jack |publisher=americancatholic.org|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next 15 months were occupied with various journeys and administrative measures. He left Goa on 15 April 1549, stopped at Malacca, and visited [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. He was accompanied by Anjiro, two other Japanese men, Father [[Cosme de Torrès]], and Brother João Fernandes. He had taken with him presents for the "[[Emperor of Japan|King of Japan]]" since he was intending to introduce himself as the [[Apostolic Nuncio]].

Europeans had already come to Japan: the Portuguese had landed in 1543 on the island of [[Tanegashima]], where they introduced matchlock firearms to Japan.&lt;ref name="Diego Pacheco 1974 pp. 477-480"&gt;Diego Pacheco. "Xavier and Tanegashima." ''Monumenta Nipponica'', Vol. 29, No. 4 (Winter, 1974), pp. 477–480&lt;/ref&gt;

From Amboina, he wrote to his companions in Europe: "I asked a Portuguese merchant, … who had been for many days in Anjirō’s country of Japan, to give me … some information on that land and its people from what he had seen and heard. ...All the Portuguese merchants coming from Japan tell me that if I go there I shall do great service for God our Lord, more than with the pagans of India, for they are a very reasonable people. (To His Companions Residing in Rome, From Cochin, 20 January 1548, no. 18, p.&amp;nbsp;178).&lt;ref name=japc/&gt;

Francis Xavier reached Japan on 27 July 1549, with Anjiro and three other Jesuits, but he was not permitted to enter any port his ship arrived at until 15 August,&lt;ref name="Diego Pacheco 1974 pp. 477-480"/&gt; when he went ashore at [[Kagoshima]], the principal port of [[Satsuma Province]] on the island of [[Kyūshū]]. As a representative of the Portuguese king, he was received in a friendly manner. [[Shimazu Takahisa]] (1514–1571), ''[[daimyō]]'' of Satsuma, gave a friendly reception to Francis on 29 September 1549, but in the following year he forbade the conversion of his subjects to Christianity under penalty of death; Christians in Kagoshima could not be given any catechism in the following years. The Portuguese missionary Pedro de Alcáçova would later write in 1554:

&lt;blockquote&gt; In Cangoxima, the first place Father Master Francisco stopped at, there were a good number of Christians, although there was no one there to teach them; the shortage of labourers prevented the whole kingdom from becoming Christian.&lt;ref name="Diego Pacheco 1974 pp. 477-480"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was hosted by Anjirō's family until October 1550.&lt;ref name=butler/&gt; From October to December 1550, he resided in [[Yamaguchi, Yamaguchi|Yamaguchi]]. Shortly before Christmas, he left for [[Kyoto]] but failed to meet with the Emperor. He returned to Yamaguchi in March 1551, where the daimyo of the province gave him permission to preach. However, lacking fluency in the Japanese language, he had to limit himself to reading aloud the translation of a catechism.

Francis was the first Jesuit to go to Japan as a missionary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shusaku Endo]] (1969), ''[[Silence (novel)|Silence]]'', p. vii, Translator's Preface, William Johnston, Taplinger Publishing Company, New York&lt;/ref&gt; He brought with him paintings of the Madonna and the Madonna and Child. These paintings were used to help teach the Japanese about Christianity. There was a huge language barrier as Japanese was unlike other languages the missionaries had previously encountered. For a long time Francis struggled to learn the language.

Having learned that evangelical poverty did not have the appeal in Japan that it had in Europe and in India, he decided to change his approach. Hearing after a time that a Portuguese ship had arrived at a port in the province of Bungo in Kyushu and that the prince there would like to see him, Xavier now set out southward. The Jesuit, in a fine cassock, surplice, and stole, was attended by thirty gentlemen and as many servants, all in their best clothes. Five of them bore on cushions valuable articles, including a portrait of Our Lady and a pair of velvet slippers, these not gifts for the prince, but solemn offerings to Xavier, to impress the onlookers with his eminence. Handsomely dressed, with his companions acting as attendants, he presented himself before Oshindono, the ruler of Nagate, and as a representative of the great kingdom of Portugal, offered him letters and presents: a musical instrument, a watch, and other attractive objects which had been given him by the authorities in India for the emperor.&lt;ref name=crawley /&gt;

For forty-five years the Jesuits were the only missionaries in Asia, but the Franciscans also began proselytising in Asia as well. Christian missionaries were later forced into exile, along with their assistants. Some were able to stay behind, however Christianity was then kept underground so as to not be persecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vlam|first=Grace A. H.|date=|year=1979|title=The Portrait of S.

The Japanese people were not easily converted; many of the people were already [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] or [[Shinto]]. Francis tried to combat the disposition of some of the Japanese that a God who had created everything, including evil, could not be good. The concept of Hell was also a struggle; the Japanese were bothered by the idea of their ancestors living in Hell. Despite Francis's different religion, he felt that they were good people, much like Europeans, and could be converted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Xavier was welcomed by the [[Shingon]] monks since he used the word ''[[Vairocana|Dainichi]]'' for the Christian God; attempting to adapt the concept to local traditions. As Xavier learned more about the religious nuances of the word, he changed to ''Deusu''&lt;ref name=butler/&gt; from the Latin and Portuguese ''Deus''. The monks later realised that Xavier was preaching a rival religion and grew more aggressive towards his attempts at conversion.

With the passage of time, his sojourn in Japan could be considered somewhat fruitful as attested by congregations established in [[Hirado]], Yamaguchi, and [[Bungo Province|Bungo]]. Xavier worked for more than two years in Japan and saw his successor-Jesuits established. He then decided to return to India. Historians debate the exact path he returned by, but from evidence attributed to the captain of his ship, he may have travelled through Tanegeshima and Minato, and avoided Kagoshima because of the hostility of the daimyo.&lt;ref name="Diego Pacheco 1974 pp. 477-480"/&gt; During his trip, a tempest forced him to stop on an island near [[Guangzhou]], China, where he met Diogo Pereira, a rich merchant and an old friend from [[Kochi|Cochin]]. Pereira showed him a letter from Portuguese prisoners in Guangzhou, asking for a Portuguese ambassador to speak to the Chinese Emperor on their behalf. Later during the voyage, he stopped at Malacca on 27 December 1551, and was back in Goa by January 1552.

On 17 April he set sail with Diogo Pereira on the ''Santa Cruz'' for China. He planned to introduce himself as Apostolic Nuncio and Pereira as ambassador of the King of Portugal. But then he realized that he had forgotten his testimonial letters as an Apostolic Nuncio. Back in Malacca, he was confronted by the ''capitão'' Álvaro de Ataíde da Gama who now had total control over the harbour. The ''capitão'' refused to recognize his title of Nuncio, asked Pereira to resign from his title of ambassador, named a new crew for the ship, and demanded the gifts for the Chinese Emperor be left in Malacca.

In late August 1552, the ''Santa Cruz'' reached the Chinese island of [[Shangchuan]], 14&amp;nbsp;km away from the southern coast of mainland China, near [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]], Guangdong, 200&amp;nbsp;km south-west of what later became [[Hong Kong]]. At this time, he was accompanied only by a Jesuit student, Álvaro Ferreira, a Chinese man called António, and a [[Malabars|Malabar]] servant called Christopher. Around mid-November he sent a letter saying that a man had agreed to take him to the mainland in exchange for a large sum of money. Having sent back Álvaro Ferreira, he remained alone with António. He died from a fever at Shangchuan, Taishan, China, on 3 December 1552, while he was waiting for a boat that would take him to mainland China.

Xavier was first buried on a beach at [[Shangchuan Island]], [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]], Guangdong. His [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]] body was taken from the island in February 1553 and was temporarily buried in [[St. Paul's Church, Melaka|St. Paul's church]] in [[Portuguese Malacca]] on 22 March 1553. An open grave in the church now marks the place of Xavier's burial. Pereira came back from Goa, removed the corpse shortly after 15 April 1553, and moved it to his house. On 11 December 1553, Xavier's body was shipped to Goa. The body is now in the [[Basilica of Bom Jesus]] in Goa, where it was placed in a glass container encased in a silver casket on 2 December 1637.&lt;ref name="Gesù"&gt;[http://www.chiesadelgesu.org/html/d_cappella_san_francesco_saverio_it.html Cappella di san Francesco Saverio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617051526/http://www.chiesadelgesu.org/html/d_cappella_san_francesco_saverio_it.html |date=17 June 2011 }}, at the official website of [[Il Gesù]]. {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This casket, constructed by Goan silversmiths between 1636 and 1637, was an exemplary blend of Italian and Indian aesthetic sensibilities. There are 32 silver plates on all the four sides of the casket depicting different episodes from the life of the Saint:

*Francis lies on the ground with his arms and legs tied, but the cords break miraculously.
*Francis kisses the ulcer of a patient in a Venetian hospital.
*He is visited by [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]] as he lies ailing in the hospital of Vicenza.

*A vision about his sister's prophecy about his fate.
*He saves the secretary of the Portuguese Ambassador while crossing the Alps.
*He lifts a sick man who dies after receiving communion but freed from fever.
*He baptises in Travancore.
*He resuscitates a boy who died in a well at Cape Comorin.
*He cures miraculously a man full of sores.

The right [[forearm]], which Xavier used to bless and baptise his converts, was detached by [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Superior General]] [[Claudio Acquaviva]] in 1614. It has been displayed since in a silver reliquary at the main Jesuit church in Rome, [[Il Gesù]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/saint-s-right-forearm-will-arrive-in-quebec-this-week-as-part-of-canadian-tour-1.3741465|title=Saint's right forearm will arrive in Quebec this week as part of Canadian tour|last=|first=|date=1 January 2018|work=[[CTV Montreal]]|access-date=2 January 2018|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Xavier's arm bones was brought to [[Colonial Macau|Macau]] where it was kept in a silver [[reliquary]]. The relic was destined for Japan but religious persecution there persuaded the church to keep it in Macau's [[Ruins of St. Paul|Cathedral of St. Paul]]. It was subsequently moved to [[St. Joseph's Seminary and Church|St. Joseph's]] and in 1978 to the Chapel of St. Francis Xavier on [[Coloane|Coloane Island]]. More recently the relic was moved to St. Joseph's Church.&lt;ref name="Macau"&gt;[http://www.macautourism.gov.mo/en/discovering/sightseeing_detail.php?catid=38#33 Chapel of St. Francis Xavier] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314095338/http://www.macautourism.gov.mo/en/discovering/sightseeing_detail.php?catid=38 |date=14 March 2013 }}, at the official website of the Macau Government Tourist Office.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, on the 500th anniversary of his birth, the Xavier Tomb Monument and Chapel on the Shangchuan Island, in ruins after years of neglect under communist rule in China, was restored with support from the alumni of [[Wah Yan College, Hong Kong|Wah Yan College]], a Jesuit high school in Hong Kong.

From December 2017 to February 2018, Saint Francis Xavier's [[Relic|first class relic]] of his arm toured in various locations in Canada. The faithful, especially students participating with [[Catholic Christian Outreach]] at [[Rise Up (conference)|Rise Up 2017]] in Ottawa, venerated the relics. The tour continued to every city where CCO and/or the Jesuits are present in Canada: Quebec City, St. John's, Halifax, St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish (neither CCO nor the Jesuits are present here), Kingston, Toronto, Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Regina, Calgary, Vancouver, Victoria, and Montreal before returning to Ottawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cco.ca/relic/|title=St. FX Relic - CCO|work=CCO|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relic was then returned to Rome with a Mass of Thanksgiving celebrated by [[Terrence Prendergast|Archbishop Terrence Prendergast]] at the [[Church of the Gesù|Church of the Gesu]].

==Veneration==

===Beatification and canonization===
Francis Xavier was beatified by [[Paul V]] on 25 October 1619, and was [[canonized]] by [[Gregory XV]] on 12 March (12 April&lt;ref&gt;Jesuit prayer-book "Srce Isusovo Spasenje naše" ("Heart of Jesus our Salvation"), Zagreb, 1946, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;) 1622, at the same time as [[Ignatius Loyola]].&lt;ref&gt;For the most recent study of Francis Xavier's canonization process, see Franco Mormando, "The Making of the Second Jesuit Saint: The Campaign for the Canonization of Francis Xavier, 1555–1622" in ''Francis Xavier and the Jesuit Missions in the Far East,'' ed. F. Mormando, Chestnut Hill, MA: The Jesuit Institute, Boston College, 2006, pp. 9–22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pius XI proclaimed him the "Patron of Catholic Missions".&lt;ref name=benedict&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/april/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060422_gesuiti_en.html |title= Address Of Benedic XVI To The Fathers And Brothers Of The Society Of Jesus, April 22, 2006 |publisher=vatican.va|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[feast day]] is 3 December.&lt;ref&gt;Attwater (1965), pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pilgrimage centres===

====Goa====
Saint Francis Xavier's relics are kept in a silver casket, elevated inside the [[Bom Jesus Basilica]] and are exposed (being brought to ground level) generally every ten years, but this is discretionary. The sacred relics went on display starting on 22 November 2014 at the  XVII Solemn Exposition. The display closed on 4 January 2015. The previous exposition, the sixteenth, was held from 21 November 2004 to 2 January 2005.

Relics of Saint Francis Xavier are also found in the Espirito Santo (Holy Spirit) Church, [[Margão]], in Sanv Fransiku Xavierachi Igorz (Church of St. Francis Xavier), [[Batpal]], [[Canacona]], Goa. and at St. Francis Xavier Chapel, Portais, Panjim.

====Other places====
Other pilgrimage centres include Saint Francis Xavier's birthplace in Navarra, Church of [[Il Gesu]], Rome, Malacca (where he was buried for 2 years, before being brought to Goa), Sancian (Place of death), and more.

Saint Francis Xavier is a major venerated saint in both Sonora and the neighbouring U.S. state of [[Arizona]]. In [[Magdalena de Kino]] in [[Sonora]], Mexico, in the Church of Santa María Magdalena, there is reclining statue of San Francisco Xavier brought by pioneer Jesuit missionary Padre [[Eusebio Kino]] in the early 18th century. The statue is said to be miraculous and is the object of pilgrimage for many of the region. Also [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] is a pilgrimage site. The mission is an active parish church ministering to the people of the San Xavier District, Tohono O'odham Nation, and nearby Tucson, Arizona.

===Novena of grace===
{{further|Novena of Grace}}
[[File:Unzenhell3.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|Fumaroles at Mt. Unzen, Japan]]
The [[Novena of Grace]] is a popular devotion to Francis Xavier, typically prayed either on the nine days before 3 December, or on 4 March through 12 March (the anniversary of Pope Gregory XV's canonisation of Xavier in 1622). It began with the Italian Jesuit missionary [[Marcello Mastrilli]]. Before he could travel to the Far East, Mastrilli was gravely injured in a freak accident after a festive celebration dedicated to the [[Immaculate Conception]] in Naples. Delirious and on the verge of death, Mastrilli saw Xavier, who he later said asked him to choose between travelling or death by holding the respective symbols, to which Mastrilli answered, "I choose that which God wills."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=17UZAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Marcello%20Mastrilli&amp;pg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;q=Marcello%20Mastrilli&amp;f=false "Japanese Sketches"] in ''The Month'', Volume 11 (1869) p.241&lt;/ref&gt; Upon regaining his health, Mastrilli made his way via Goa and the Philippines to Satsuma, Japan. The [[Tokugawa shogunate]] beheaded the missionary in October 1637, after undergoing three days of tortures involving the volcanic sulphurous fumes from [[Mount Unzen|Mt. Unzen]], known as the ''Hell mouth'' or "pit" that had supposedly caused an earlier missionary to renounce his faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-0-674-02448-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:VisionStFrancisBoccacio.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Vision of St. Francis Xavier'', by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]]]]
Saint Francis Xavier is noteworthy for his [[missionary work]], both as organiser and as pioneer, reputed to have converted more people than anyone else has done since [[Saint Paul]]. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] said of both [[Ignatius of Loyola]] and Francis Xavier: "not only their history which was interwoven for many years from [[Paris]] and Rome, but a unique desire — a unique passion, it could be said — moved and sustained them through different human events: the passion to give to God-Trinity a glory always greater and to work for the proclamation of the Gospel of Christ to the peoples who had been ignored."&lt;ref name=benedict/&gt; By consulting with the earlier ancient [[Christians of St. Thomas]] in India, Xavier developed Jesuit missionary methods. His success also spurred many Europeans to join the order, as well as become missionaries throughout the world. His personal efforts most affected Christians in [[India]] and the [[East Indies]] ([[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Timor]]). India still has numerous Jesuit missions, and many more schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Category:Jesuit schools in India|date=2018-04-02|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Jesuit_schools_in_India&amp;oldid=833714981|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xavier also worked to propagate Christianity in [[China]] and [[Japan]]. However, following the persecutions of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and the subsequent closing of Japan to foreigners, the Christians of Japan were forced to go underground to develop an independent Christian culture. Likewise, while Xavier inspired many missionaries to China, Chinese Christians also were forced underground and developed their own Christian culture.

A small chapel designed by [[Achille-Antoine Hermitte]] was completed in 1869 over Xavier's death place on Shangchuan Island, Canton.
It was damaged and restored several times, with the most recent restoration in 2006 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Achille-Antoine Hermitte’s Surviving Building / 阿基里‧ 安當‧ 埃爾米特的倖存建築 |last1=Davies |last2=戴偉思  |first1=Stephen|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch |volume=56 |year=2016 |publisher=Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch |via=[[JSTOR]] |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/jroyaaisasocihkb.56.92 |accessdate=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Francis Xavier is the patron saint of his native [[Navarre]], which celebrates his feast day on 3 December as a government holiday. In addition to Roman Catholic Masses remembering Xavier on that day (now known as the Day of Navarra), celebrations in the surrounding weeks honour the region's cultural heritage. Furthermore, in the 1940s, devoted Catholics instituted the [[Javierada]], an annual day-long pilgrimage (often on foot) from the capital at [[Pamplona]] to Xavier, where the Jesuits have built a basilica and museum and restored his family's castle.

The names ''Francisco Xavier'', ''António Xavier'', ''João Xavier'', ''Caetano Xavier'', ''Domingos Xavier'' et cetera, were very common till quite recently in Goa. ''Fransiskus Xaverius'' is commonly used as a name for [[Indonesia]]n Catholics, usually abbreviated as FX. In Austria and [[Bavaria]] the name is spelled as ''Xaver'' (pronounced (ˈk͡saːfɐ)) and often used in addition to Francis as ''Franz-Xaver'' (frant͡sˈk͡saːfɐ). Many Catalan men are named for him, often using the two-name combination Francesc Xavier. In English speaking countries, "Xavier" until recently was likely to follow "Francis"; in the 2000s, however, "Xavier" by itself has become more popular than "Francis", and since 2001 is now one of the hundred most common male baby names in the U.S.A.&lt;ref name="ssa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/ |title=Popular Baby Names |publisher=ssa.gov|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Sevier family name, possibly most famous in the United States for [[John Sevier]], originated from the name Xavier.

Many churches all over the world, often founded by Jesuits, have been named in honour of Xavier. The many in the United States include the historic [[St. Francis Xavier Church (Warwick, Maryland)|St. Francis Xavier Shrine]] at [[Warwick, Maryland]], (founded 1720, the school of the American founding father [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]] (1737–1832) – longest living signer and only Catholic at the [[Continental Congress]] to sign the [[Declaration of Independence]], 1776), and cousin to the first American-born Bishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]],  [[Archbishop of Baltimore|Bishop and later Archbishop of Baltimore]], 1790–1815, There are also the American educational teaching order [[Xaverian Brothers]], the [[Basilica of St. Francis Xavier]] in [[Dyersville, Iowa]], and the [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]] (founded in 1692, and known for its [[Spanish Colonial architecture]]).

===In art===
[[Rubens]] painted ''St Francis Xavier Raising the Dead'' for a Jesuit church in Antwerp, in which he depicted one of St Francis's many miracles.&lt;ref&gt;Rubens, William Unger, S. R. K. "St. Francis Xavier Raising the Dead". ''The American Art Review'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (Dec. 1879), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charles Bridge]] in Prague, Czech Republic, features a [[Statue of Francis Xavier, Charles Bridge|statue of Francis Xavier]].
In front of [[Oita Station]] of [[Oita City]], in [[Oita Prefecture]], previously known as [[Bungo Province]] in Japan, there is one statue of Francis Xavier.
The monument [[Padrão dos Descobrimentos]] in [[Belém (Lisbon)]], Portugal, features Francis Xavier image.

===Missionary===
Shortly before leaving Xavier had issued a famous instruction to Father [[Gaspar Barazeuz]] who was leaving to go to Ormuz (a kingdom on an island in the [[Persian Gulf]], formerly attached to the [[Persia|Empire of Persia]], now part of [[Iran]]), that he should mix with sinners:

&lt;blockquote&gt; And if you wish to bring forth much fruit, both for yourselves and for your neighbours, and to live consoled, converse with sinners, making them unburden themselves to you. These are the living books by which you are to study, both for your preaching and for your own consolation. I do not say that you should not on occasion read written books... to support what you say against vices with authorities from the Holy Scriptures and examples from the lives of the saints.&lt;ref name="Ante Kadič 1961 pp. 12-18"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Modern scholars place the number of people converted to Christianity by Francis Xavier at around 30,000. And while some of Xavier's methods have been since criticised (he forced converts to take [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] names and dress in Western clothes, approved the persecution of the [[Eastern Orthodox|Eastern Church]], and used the [[Goa]] government as a missionary tool), he has also earned praise. He insisted that missionaries adapt to many of the customs, and most certainly the language, of the culture they wish to evangelise. And unlike later missionaries, Xavier supported an educated native clergy. Though for a time it seemed his work in [[Japan]] was subsequently destroyed by persecution, [[Protestant]] missionaries three centuries later discovered that approximately 100,000 Christians still practised in the [[Nagasaki]] area.&lt;ref name="ctlibrary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ch/131christians/missionaries/xavier.html |title=Francis Xavier - Christian History &amp;amp; Biography - ChristianityTodayLibrary.com |publisher=ctlibrary.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis Xavier's work initiated permanent change in eastern [[Indonesia]], and he was known as the "Apostle of the Indies" where in 1546–1547 he worked in the [[Maluku Islands]] among the people of [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], [[Ternate]], and [[Morotai]] (or Moro), and laid the foundations for a permanent mission. After he left the Maluku Islands, others carried on his work and by the 1560s there were 10,000 Roman Catholics in the area, mostly on Ambon. By the 1590s there were 50,000 to 60,000.&lt;ref name="RICKLEFSp25"&gt;{{cite book| last =Ricklefs | first =M.C. | authorlink = | author2 = | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition | publisher =MacMillan | year =1993 | location =London | page =25 | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-333-57689-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in the Goa Inquisition===
Deeply imbued with the theology of the later Augustine, he was fiercely "jealous" of "God's greater glory" and deeply suspicious of the "untutored" efforts of man to scale the heights of the spirit.{{sfn|De Rosa|2006|p=99}} This world view led him to missionary tactics that even the Jesuit [[James Patrick Broderick]], though writing an admiring biography, condemns as Xavier's "woefully inadequate views about Indian religion and civilization".{{sfn |Brodrick|1952}} It was, however, most common for Catholic missionaries to have [[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus|dim hope for the salvation]] of those who were not baptized,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/clemens-vi/la/documents/epistula-super-quibusdam-29-sept-1351.html|title=Epistula Super quibusdam (29 Sept. 1351), ad Mekhitar, Catholicon Armeniorum|website=w2.vatican.va|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; up to the time of the [[Second Vatican Council]] in the 1960s &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html|title=Lumen gentium, 16|last=|first=|date=|website=www.vatican.va|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of Francis Xavier in the [[Goa Inquisition]] is controversial. He had written to King [[John III of Portugal|João III]] of Portugal in 1546, encouraging him to dispatch the Inquisition to Goa, which he did many years later in 1560.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Goa|author=Abram, D.|date=2003|publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=9781843530817 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GGZRtj4OnccC |page=94|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Xavier died in 1552 without living to see the horrors of the Goa Inquisition, but some historians believe that he was aware of the Portuguese Inquisition's brutality. In an interview to an Indian newspaper, historian [[Teotónio de Souza]] stated that Francis Xavier and [[Simão Rodrigues]], another founder-member of the [[Society of Jesus]], were together in Lisbon before Francis left for India. Both were asked to assist spiritually the prisoners of the Inquisition and were present at the very first [[auto-da-fé]] celebrated in Portugal in September 1540, at which 23 were absolved and two were condemned to be burnt, including a French cleric. Hence, he believes that Xavier was aware of the brutality of the Inquisition.&lt;ref name="deccanherald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/66330/xavier-aware-brutality-inquisition.html|title='Xavier was aware of the brutality of the Inquisition'|publisher=deccanherald.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Félix Díaz Velasco''' (17 February 1868{{spaced ndash}}9 July 1945) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[politician]] and [[general]] born in [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca]]. He graduated as an [[engineer]] from the [[Colegio Militar]] in 1888. He was a leading figure in the rebellion against [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Francisco I. Madero]] during the [[Mexican Revolution]].

==Biography==
He was the nephew of President [[Porfirio Díaz]] and held several offices during his uncle's tenure. After Porfirio Díaz was deposed, Madero was elected President and early in 1912, Díaz joined [[Victoriano Huerta]] and [[Bernardo Reyes]] in their rebellion against Madero. Díaz was captured in October 1912 and sentenced to death for treason, although Madero later commuted the sentence to [[life imprisonment]].

Díaz escaped from jail during ''[[La decena trágica]]'' ("the Ten Tragic Days"), the Huerta-led coup d'état that overthrew and assassinated Madero. A few days later, after Madero's arrest, Díaz signed the [[Embassy Pact]] (''Pacto de la Embajada''), facilitated by [[United States|American]] ambassador [[Henry Lane Wilson]] which installed Huerta as President and allowed Díaz to run as presidential candidate on the next election. Huerta did not honor his part of the agreement and sent Díaz to [[Japan]] as an ambassador. At his return Díaz was constantly harassed by Huerta causing him to go into exile to [[New York City]] and later [[Havana]].

He returned to Mexico in May 1916 and became the leader of the [[National Reorganizer Army]] (''Ejército Reorganizador Nacional''). His new revolutionary efforts were not too successful and was forced to retreat to the south of Mexico where he officially remained in arms.

In 1920 Díaz went into exile once again. He returned in 1937 and settled in [[Veracruz, Veracruz]], where he died on July 9, 1945.

'''Gedong Bagus Oka''' (October 3, 1921 – November 14, 2002) was a Hindu reformer and philosopher in [[Indonesia]]. She was one of the foremost authorities on [[Agama Hindu Dharma]] and started the ''[[Parisada Hindu Dharma|Parisada Hindu Dharma Indonesia]]'' movement in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/g/gedong-bagus-oka/index.shtml] (Indonesian) – ENSIKLOPEDI TOKOH INDONESIA&lt;/ref&gt; She was a recipient of the 1994  [[Jamnalal Bajaj Award]].&lt;ref name="Jamnalal Bajaj Award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamnalalbajajfoundation.org/awards/archives/1994/international/mrs-gedong-bagoes-oka |title=Jamnalal Bajaj Award |publisher=Jamnalal Bajaj Foundation |date=2015 |accessdate=October 13, 2015 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gedong was born with the name Ni Wayan Gedong in [[Karangasem Regency|Karangasem]] as the daughter of the couple I Komang Layang and Ni Komang Pupuh, a member of the village council. Unlike most females at that time, the young Gedong was given the freedom by her parents to undertake all of her wishes. She was allowed to go to school. So she went to study in [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Jakarta]].

At school in Yogyakarta, she had the liberty to study Christianity. Her understanding about Christianity and her birth in the Hindu tradition caused her to befriend [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. They discussed Christian and Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Ramstedt, Martin (2000) [http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/23/theme/23T5.html Gedong Bagoes Oka]. IIAS Newsletter&lt;/ref&gt;

The understanding about these two religions made her a follower of Hindu spirit, that is ''[[ahimsa|{{IAST|ahiṁsā}}]]'' (non violence) and ''[[satya]]'' (truth).

'''George Walker Crawford''' (December 22, 1798 – July 27, 1872) was a licensed [[lawyer|attorney]] turned [[politician]] from [[Columbia County, Georgia]]. Crawford was appointed [[attorney general]] for the state in 1827, by [[Governor of Georgia|Governor]] [[John Forsyth (Georgia)|John Forsyth]], serving in that capacity until 1831. Crawford also served five years in the [[Georgia General Assembly|General Assembly]]'s [[Georgia House of Representatives|lower house]] as a representative of [[Richmond County, Georgia|Richmond County]] on a [[Party platform|platform]] of [[states' rights]].

George Crawford served in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], filling the seat vacated by [[Richard W. Habersham]] who died while in office. Crawford was elected Georgia's 38th [[List of Governors of Georgia|governor]] – serving two terms from 1843–47. He became the only [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] candidate in state history to occupy the [[Georgia Governor's Mansion|Governor's Mansion]]. Crawford also served as [[United States Secretary of War]] from 1849–50.&lt;ref name="congressbio"/&gt;

Crawford's time in [[US President|President]] [[Zachary Taylor]]'s [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] was marred by speculation regarding a [[probate]] [[land claim|claim]] he settled for [[George Galphin]]'s heirs. Crawford received a [[gratuity]] of ''substantial [[remuneration]]'' for his services' - Crawford's political adversaries framed it as the ''[[Galphin Affair]]'' – marking the end of Crawford's political aspirations. When President Taylor unexpectedly died while in office, Crawford resigned his position as Secretary of War and entered political retirement.

In 1861, however, Crawford was elected a delegate from Richmond County to the state's [[Georgia General Assembly#Georgia Secession Convention|Secession Convention]] which brought him out of retirement to answer the call of his [[Constituent (politics)|constituent]]s. By the convention's first order of business, Crawford was elected ''Permanent President of the Convention'' by which he presided over Georgia's decision to secede from the [[United States|Union]].&lt;ref name="gapedia"/&gt;

==Early life==
George Walker Crawford was born on December 22, 1798, in [[Columbia County, Georgia]]. He was the fourth son of Peter and Mary Ann Crawford. His father was a [[veteran]] of the [[American Revolutionary War]] from [[Virginia]] who had settled in Georgia to claim a land share, known as a ''bounty grant'', which the state of Georgia had set aside for "those who had fought for independence".&lt;ref name="peterc"/&gt;

{{anchor|Peter Crawford}}''Peter Crawford'' acquired a sizable [[Land lot|tract]] of land that he called ''Belair Plantation''. The [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] was situated close to his [[uncle]], Joel Crawford. Peter's uncle Joel fathered [[William H. Crawford]], soon becoming a [[politician]] renowned locally for his political service to the state and for two [[political campaign|presidential bid]]s – running in 1816, and then again in 1824.&lt;ref name="ugagene"/&gt;

George Crawford grew up on the family's estate, heavily influenced by his father, and his [[cousin]] William as well. George's father was a practicing [[lawyer|attorney]] and George availed himself to the well-stocked personal library of his father while [[homeschooling]] his education. Peter Crawford also entered Georgia politics himself – beginning as Columbia County's first ''clerk of courts'' and becoming a 10-term representative in the [[Georgia General Assembly|state legislature]].&lt;ref name="peterc"/&gt; George Crawford's cousin, William H. Crawford, was also becoming well known for his political service, and was the subject of local legend for two famous duels he had been a principal of.&lt;ref name="wilduel"/&gt;

George Crawford built on his homeschooling at the [[Princeton University#College of New Jersey|College of New Jersey]]'s [[school of law]] (''later becoming [[Princeton University]]''). Crawford graduated with a [[bachelor's degree]] in 1820, and subsequently completed an [[internship]] under the [[tutelage]] of [[Richard Henry Wilde]].&lt;ref name="govofga"/&gt; Crawford was licensed to practice law in 1822, and started a legal practice in [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] partnering with [[Henry Harford Cumming|Henry H. Cumming]]. He went on to obtain a [[master's degree]] from the [[Franklin College of Arts and Sciences]], the founding college of the [[University of Georgia]]. After graduating Franklin, Crawford served from 1824 to 1825, as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[10th Georgia Regiment|10th Regiment]] of the [[Georgia Militia]].&lt;ref name="gagovs"/&gt;

In 1826, George Crawford married Mary Ann MacIntosh, having four children of the marriage: William Peter, Sarah MacIntosh, Anna Elizabeth, and Charles. George W. Crawford embarked on his political career the following year, accepting a [[gubernatorial]] appointment to become Georgia's attorney general.&lt;ref name="govofga"/&gt;

==Attorney General of Georgia==
[[Governor of Georgia|Governor]] [[John Forsyth (politician)|John Forsyth]] appointed Crawford to succeed Thomas F. Wells as Georgia's [[attorney general]] in 1827. The following year, Crawford challenged [[Congressman]] Thomas E. Burnside, [[Ambrose Burnside]]'s uncle,&lt;ref name="galegends"/&gt; to a [[duel]] over published [[defamation]] Burnside had written about Crawford's father.

He shot Burnside dead in the infamous duel, prompting the state to pass new legislation; "forbidding persons involved in duels from holding office".&lt;ref name="govofga"/&gt; The restriction only applied to duels fought after the law was [[Bill (law)#Enactment|enacted]] and did not affect Crawford's career.&lt;ref name="mcrc"/&gt; He continued serving as attorney general until 1831, when he was succeeded by [[Charles J. Jenkins]].&lt;ref name="gahist"/&gt;

===The code duello===
When George Crawford read the anonymous [[letter to the editor]] published in ''[[The Augusta Chronicle]]'' he was incensed by the prose – sharply criticizing the political views of his father, then declining in health. Crawford regarded it as an attack on his father's good name. Crawford demanded the newspaper editor give him the author's name but the editor refused, protecting Burnside's identity by telling Crawford the letter was from a woman, and that for this reason, he would not release the person's name.&lt;ref name="galegends"/&gt;

Inexplicably, Burnside contacted Crawford telling him that he was the author. Crawford immediately challenged Burnside to a duel which Burnside accepted, although with reluctance.&lt;ref name="galegends"/&gt; The [[code duello]] was waning [[Popularity#in vogue|in vogue]] but it was still held as a measure which an honorable man was obliged to endure. Burnside was aspiring his own political career which showed promise of [[upward mobility]]. Burnside felt he would be shamed with dishonor if he refused, and in his era, without honor there was no career in politics.&lt;ref name="galegends"/&gt;

Dueling had already been outlawed in Georgia so the two [[belligerent]]s, with their [[duel#second|second]]s, traveled together by train to [[Fort Mitchell, Alabama]] where the practice was still legal – to finish what by then had become a "well-publicized fight". Burnside seemed to have sensed the duel would not end in his favor, dispatching a letter to his wife on the eve of the fateful encounter:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="float:right"&gt;Fort Mitchell, Jan. 24, 1828&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Wife and Mother:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Tomorrow I fight. I do it on principle. Whatever may be my fate, I believe I am right. On this ground I have acted and will act. I believe I shall succeed, but if I do not I am prepared for consequences. Kiss the children and tell them that if I fall my last thought was of them. Yours most affectionately&lt;span style="float:right"&gt;Thomas E. Burnside&lt;ref name="galegends"/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas E. Burnside was [[interred]] in the private burial ground of Colonel [[John Crowell (Alabama)|John Crowell]], renowned for his participation in the [[War of 1812]]. The Colonel lived near the site where the duel had taken place and personally ensured every [[etiquette|protocol]] of respect was accorded at Burnside's burial. Two weeks passed before Mrs. Burnside received word of her husband's demise. It was said that she nearly died herself from distraught upon receiving the news.&lt;ref name="galegends"/&gt;

She moved with her children to [[Dahlonega, Georgia]], residing there until her death. Crawford carried regret for his role in what was called "a deplorable and unfortunate affair".&lt;ref name="govofga"/&gt; He was known to have made anonymous financial contributions to Burnside's widow and children&lt;ref name="govofga"/&gt; though he was remembered as saying it made no amends – and for having expressed [[lament]] shortly before his own death in 1872.&lt;ref name="galegends"/&gt;

==Congressman==
In 1837, Crawford was elected to the [[Georgia General Assembly]] as a member of the [[Georgia House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] for Richmond County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=George W.|title=Historical collections of Georgia : containing the most interesting facts, traditions, biographical sketches, anecdotes, etc., relating to its history and antiquities, from its first settlement to the present time|date=1854|publisher=Pudney &amp; Russell|location=New York|page=245|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oWIGNjgAlpkC&amp;lpg=PA245&amp;ots=f33uugpNTd&amp;dq=%22George%20W.%20Crawford%22%20georgia&amp;pg=PA245#v=onepage&amp;q=%22George%20W.%20Crawford%22%20georgia&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Crawford distinguished himself as a fiscal conservative. He was elevated to the [[United States House of Representatives]] as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[Richard W. Habersham]]. His term there was short, only serving from January 7 to March 3, 1843.

==Governor of Georgia==
George W. Crawford was the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]'s nominee for [[Governor of Georgia|governor]] in 1843. Crawford defeated the Democratic nominee, [[Mark Anthony Cooper]], by a vote of 38,813 to 35,325&lt;ref name="govofga"/&gt; succeeding [[Charles James McDonald|Charles J. McDonald]] to become the first Whig candidate to serve as Georgia's governor (''as of 2014, he remains the only Whig governor''). The Whigs won a majority in both houses of the [[Georgia General Assembly|state legislature]] in 1843, as well. Crawford was reelected in 1845, defeating Democratic challenger [[Matthew Hall McAllister|Matthew H. McAllister]] by a margin of 1,751 votes.&lt;ref name="govofga"/&gt;

With the legislature's support, Crawford was able to effect the Whig's agenda which focused on debt reduction and fiscal restraint. Crawford's administration was able to reduce expenditures more than $66,000 in its first year and nearly eliminate the state's debt of $500,000 before being succeeded by [[George W. Towns]].&lt;ref name="govofga"/&gt; Besides implementing sound budget policy, Crawford was able to expand educational opportunities in the state and hasten construction of the state-owned [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gates|first1=Frederick B.|title=The Impact of the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad on the Development of the Georgia Upcountry, 1840-1860|journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=Summer 2007|volume=91|issue=2|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aqh&amp;AN=25565260&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=13 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804033823/http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aqh&amp;AN=25565260&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|archivedate=4 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawford's administration established the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]] as well, which had failed to be institutionalized for decades of previous effort.&lt;ref name="govofga"/&gt; He redrew the state's congressional maps, and reformed the state penitentiary – making it "a more economically sound institution". Crawford also succeeded at dismantling the [[central bank|Georgia Central Bank]], an important Whig campaign endeavor for years.

==Secretary of War==
When [[Major general (United States)|General]] [[Zachary Taylor]] became [[President of the United States]] in 1849, he appointed Crawford [[United States Secretary of War]]. As War Secretary, he was involved in settling a claim from the [[United States government]] for the Galphin family, descendants of [[George Galphin]], an American businessman who specialized in [[Indian Trade]]. Crawford received a large payment for his services and several of his political foes seized upon the opportunity to suggest impropriety.

Crawford was subsequently investigated by a [[Government agency|commission]] and completely [[exonerated]] of any wrongdoing yet his critics continued casting aspersions.&lt;ref name="govofga"/&gt; Crawford resigned along with the rest of the [[Zachary Taylor#Administration and cabinet|Taylor administration]] in 1850, when [[Millard Fillmore]] became president after Taylor's sudden death while in office.

}}
In 1861, Crawford was elected as a delegate from [[Richmond County, Georgia]] to the state's [[Georgia General Assembly#Georgia Secession Convention|Secession Convention]]. The delegation elected Crawford president of the convention by a unanimous vote&lt;ref name="govofga"/&gt; and he oversaw the state's vote of secession. As the convention's president, Crawford is considered the author of Georgia's [[Ordinance of Secession]], the official document announcing the state's formal intent to secede the federal [[US|Union]] – originally as an independent [[republic]], ultimately to join the [[Confederate States of America]].

The delegation approved the ordinance January 19, 1861, with 208 voting in favor of secession and 89 opposed. The delegates signed the document in celebratory fashion two days later in the [[public square]] in front of the [[state capitol|statehouse]] in [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]] where the convention was assembled. Crawford survived to witness the consequences of enacting the ordinance, [[lament]]ing its cost in the shed blood of Georgia citizens rallied by the convention's call.

Crawford was to be tried for inciting a rebellion due to his role in presiding over the state's secession and was excluded from eligibility for both [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s and [[Andrew Johnson|Johnson]]'s amnesty proclamations because of his leadership status. Crawford escaped the harsh consequences of an [[adjudication]] of guilt in 1865, when Johnson approved his direct application for [[amnesty]] thereby restoring Crawford as a citizen of the United States in good stead – with full protection of his person and property against all forms of [[reprisal]].&lt;ref name="confpapers"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Crawford died on July 27, 1872, at his ''Belair'' estate, located near [[Augusta, Georgia]]. His funeral was held in [[St. Paul's Episcopal Church (Augusta, Georgia)|St. Paul's Episcopal Church]] and he was buried in [[Summerville Cemetery]] located in Augusta.&lt;ref name="govofga"/&gt;

On November 16, 1943, the keel was laid for the ''[[List of Liberty ships (G–Je)#George Walker Crawford|SS George Walker Crawford]]'', a [[liberty ship]] built by the [[J.A. Jones Construction|J.A. Jones Construction Company]] in [[Brunswick, Georgia]] honoring Crawford for his service to the state of Georgia. The ship was launched January 1, 1944, and delivered into federal service January 13, 1944.&lt;ref name="AutoRQ-1 namelibertyphoto" /&gt;

Crawford's biographer Len Cleveland said that in researching his material he observed that "Crawford's entire political career was motivated by a traditional sense of duty rather than by deep political convictions".&lt;ref name="govofga"/&gt; [[Robert Toombs]] spoke well of Crawford, Saying, "There are but few abler and no purer men in America, and he has administrative qualities of an unusually high order."&lt;ref name="50wad"/&gt;

'''Gerald and Sheila Broflovski''' (sometimes spelled  '''Broslovski''', '''Broslofski''', '''Brovlofski''' or '''Broflofski''') are fictional characters in the [[animated television series]] ''[[South Park]]''. The two are an upper middle-class married Jewish couple who raise their ten-year-old son [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and three-year-old [[Canadians|Canadian]]-born adopted son [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]] in the fictional town of South Park, [[Colorado]].

In tradition with the show's [[Cutout animation|animation style]], they are both composed of simple geometrical shapes, and are animated with use of a computer, though they are given the impression of being [[construction paper]] cutout compositions animated through the use of [[stop motion]], which was the technique used to animate the "[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|Spirit of Christmas]]" shorts and the show's [[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe|first episode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.everwonder.com/david/southpark/animationsp.html| title=The Method Behind the Madness of South Park| publisher=everwonder.com| accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald is voiced by series co-creator [[Matt Stone]] and Sheila was originally voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]] and is currently voiced by [[Mona Marshall]]. Their first names are derived from the first names of Stone's parents, Gerald and Sheila Stone.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Characters==
Though they are named for Stone's parents, Gerald and Sheila's characters are not largely inspired by the couple. While Stone's mother is Jewish, his father is a gentile of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent, and Stone says they raised him in an agnostic household. Stone decided to portray the character of Gerald as recognizably Jewish, stating that doing so "creates more opportunity for comedy".&lt;ref name="whois"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/980522/kyle.shtml |title=Who is Kyle Broslofski? |accessdate=2009-02-04 |author=Raphael, Rebecca |publisher=Jewish News of Greater Phoenix |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812045230/http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/980522/kyle.shtml |archivedate=August 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald grew up in South Park, and met Sheila while they attended college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Chickenpox (South Park)|Chickenpox]] |url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=1998-08-26 |season=2 |number=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two moved back to Gerald's hometown when Kyle was younger because Sheila wanted to raise her children in a small town environment,&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="entity"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[The Entity (South Park)|The Entity]] |url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2001-11-21 |season=5 |number=511}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in [[Smug Alert!]], the Broflovskis briefly moved to [[San Francisco]] when Gerald felt that South Park wasn't "progressive" enough.&lt;ref name="smug"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Smug Alert!]] |url= |series=[[South Park]] |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2006-03-29 |season=10 |number=1002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few instances, Sheila indicated displeasure with Gerald's indulgent and hypocritical behaviour,&lt;ref name="boobage"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Major Boobage]] |url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2008-03-26 |season=12 |number=1203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fancy"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]] |url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2005-03-09 |season=9 |number=901}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gerald occasionally displays subdued annoyance with his wife's meddling in others' lives. However, their marriage has been portrayed as more stable than those of the other prominent adult couples in the series, and the couple once overcame a temporary setback in their sex life when Gerald briefly suffered from [[erectile dysfunction]].&lt;ref name="combust"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Spontaneous Combustion (South Park)|Spontaneous Combustion]] |url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=1999-04-14 |season=3 |number=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerald and Sheila share a strong devotion to their Jewish religion, while expressing deep concern during the multiple times Kyle's faith in Judaism becomes enervated; However, in earlier episodes the couple has been portrayed attending the Catholic church in South Park. The couple tend to showcase liberal viewpoints, having protested the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[I'm a Little Bit Country]] |url= |series=[[South Park]] |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2003-04-09 |season=7 |number=701}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supported [[Barack Obama]] during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential race]].&lt;ref name="lastnight"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[About Last Night...

===Gerald===
Gerald is a lawyer who also serves on South Park's council as the city attorney,&lt;ref name="hippie"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Die Hippie, Die]]|url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2005-03-16 |season=9 |number=902}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his role in this profession has been put on display in episodes such as "[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]" and "[[Chef Goes Nanners]]" in which a trial or legal issue plays a large part in the plot.&lt;ref name="boobage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chefaid"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Chef Aid]] |url= |series=[[South Park]] |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=1998-10-07 |season=2 |number=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="panda"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Sexual Harassment Panda]] |url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=1999-07-07 |season=3 |number=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commonly wears an olive-green jacket over a purple shirt and forest green trousers. He sports a contemporary [[beard]] and separated [[mustache]], and is almost always seen donning a pink [[yarmulke]]. When not wearing the yarmulke, Gerald is shown to have [[Androgenic alopecia|male-pattern baldness]]. He is a generally kind, amiable person, though at intervals he has been shown to assume a snobbish attitude that disaffects his friends and family such as the episode [[Chickenpox (South Park)|Chicken Pox]] where it is revealed that he used to be close with Kenny McCormick's father but that the two had a falling out due to economic differences or when he begins acting like an arrogant snob after buying a hybrid car in [[Smug Alert!]]. In "[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]", Gerald repeatedly sued South Park Elementary (which was faultless in every case), and later every citizen of South Park, showing his shameless monetary greed and disregard for civil propriety. Gerald was once seen to have a repressed gambling problem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Red Man's Greed]] |url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2003-04-30 |season=7 |number=707}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prior struggles with a fictional form of inhalant abuse known within the show as "[[Major Boobage|cheesing]]".&lt;ref name="boobage"/&gt; Gerald is, in season 20 of the show, revealed to be an internet troll. His internet alias is 'Skankhunt42', and initially, everyone thinks that Eric Cartman is, in fact, Skankhunt42. When trolling, he makes provocative statements against women, and, most notably, "puts a dick in [women's] mouths". He always drinks red wine and listens to music by [[Boston (band)|Boston]] when trolling. His antics eventually place him in the news after trolling a Danish olympian.

===Sheila===
Sheila made her first appearance in the season one episode "[[Death (South Park episode)|Death]]" (where she was originally named Carol), and she exhibits several traits commonly associated with those of a [[Jewish mother stereotype|stereotypical Jewish mother]]. She wears her hair in a [[Beehive (hairstyle)|beehive]], is overweight, and typically wears a midnight blue suit jacket over a light gray blouse, with a dark red skirt and gray stockings. She speaks with a New York/New Jersey accent, and appears to be of less-than-average height relative to the other female adults on the show. In the episode "[[It's a Jersey Thing]]", it is revealed that Sheila was originally from New Jersey, where she was known as "S-Wow Tittybang", and that she and Gerald moved to South Park to avoid having their newly conceived child grow up there. Apart from being briefly appointed to the fictional federal position of "Secretary of Offense" under the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]], Sheila is a stay-at-home mother. As a result of hearing something shocking or inappropriate, she is often heard exclaiming "WHAT, WHAT, ''WHAT''!?", saying each word in rapid succession and putting more emphasis on the last "what". Sheila has been depicted as being a huge fan of [[Barbra Streisand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Mecha-Streisand]] |url= |series=[[South Park]] |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=1998-02-18 |season=1 |number=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In earlier seasons, Sheila often spearheaded public opposition to things she deemed harmful to children or to the Jewish community. She led a group to [[New York City]] to protest [[Terrance and Phillip]], a Canadian comedy duo whose television show's [[toilet humor]] is what she believed to be a negative influence on Kyle.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Death (South Park episode)|Death]] |url= |series=[[South Park]] |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=1997-09-17 |season=1 |number=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her outrage escalated in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]'' when she further protested Terrance and Phillip by forming "Mothers Against Canada", which eventually instigated a war between Canada and the United States. At the climax of the film, she takes her crusade against the duo to the extreme by shooting Terrance and Phillip, which fulfills an apocalyptic prophecy allowing Satan, his minions, and his lover [[Saddam Hussein]] to invade the Earth. This aspect has been toned down in recent years, and is more or less completely absent from newer episodes. Her relationship with Gerald varies, in the episode "[[Spontaneous Combustion (South Park)|Spontaneous Combustion]]" it is shown that Gerald suffers from periodic sexual dysfunction which put a strain on their relationship. In "[[Insecurity (South Park)|Insecurity]]", she and her husband used a sexual role play to have better sex.

Upon seeing Kyle taking part in a school play which involved a [[nativity scene]], Sheila pleads with the mayor to ban the use of any religious imagery within the town that could perceived as offensive to those of different beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]] |url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=1997-12-17 |season=1 |number=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her ethnicity, [[Eric Cartman]] also despises Sheila's activism, which he perceives as an attempt to inhibit anyone's ability to have fun. Cartman has even expressed his hatred for Sheila by singing a song entitled "Kyle's Mom's a Bitch".

==Family==
{{Main|List of South Park families}}''
Although Sheila is inclined to be overprotective of her children, she and Gerald tend to be caring and loving of both [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and Ike, with Sheila often referring to the boys with [[Yiddish]] terms of endearment. The couple often try to strengthen the bond between their two sons, and encourage Kyle to accept and love Ike as though they were biological brothers. The two also accompany Ike during activities that enrich his status as a [[child prodigy]], such as sitting with him as he read two [[John Steinbeck]] novels in one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]] |url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2000-06-19 |season=4 |number=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald is mostly seen as a responsible and caring father, and often attempts to teach Kyle important morals, though sometimes to a fault. Thinking he would delight Kyle by making more money, Gerald instead distressed his son by increasing the family's income at the expense of bankrupting the local elementary school.&lt;ref name="panda"/&gt; Gerald also alienated Kyle (and several other townsfolk) when, as one of the very few [[hybrid vehicle]] owners in South Park, he became increasingly self-righteous.&lt;ref name="smug"/&gt; Despite these isolated incidents, Kyle usually holds a high opinion of Gerald. Sheila is often unaware of the overwhelming effect her protests has on Kyle until Kyle gains enough courage to confront her and tell her that her actions are not the proper way to be a mother figure in his life. Kyle tends to show that he truly loves Sheila, and takes offense to any insult Cartman may offer about her.

Sheila has a deceased mother named Cleo (who also shares Gerald's surname of Broflovski) who is frequently mentioned on the show. She was seen (albeit as a corpse) in the episode "[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]" when Kyle reluctantly allowed his friends to exhume her body so that they could use it in a Halloween prank. Sheila also has a nephew named [[Kyle Schwartz|Kyle]] (her sister's son) who is another of the show's embodiment of Jewish stereotypes. Aside from his wife and sons, none of Gerald's relatives have made a major appearance on the show.

'''Gheorghe Asachi''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈɡe̯orɡe aˈsaki}}, surname also spelled '''Asaki'''; March 1, 1788 – November 12, 1869) was a [[Moldavia]]n, later [[Romania]]n prose writer, poet, painter, historian, dramatist and translator. An [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-educated [[polymath]] and [[Polyglot (person)|polyglot]], he was one of the most influential people of his generation. Asachi was a respected journalist and political figure, as well as active in technical fields such as [[civil engineering]] and [[pedagogy]], and, for long, the [[Civil service|civil servant]] charged with overseeing all Moldavian schools. Among his leading achievements were the issuing of ''[[Albina Românească]]'', a highly influential magazine, and the creation of ''[[Academia Mihăileană]]'', which replaced [[Greek language|Greek-language]] education with teaching in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. His literary works combined a taste for [[Classicism]] with [[Romanticism|Romantic]] tenets, while his version of the [[literary language]] relied on [[archaism]]s and borrowings from the [[Romanian dialects|Moldavian dialect]].

A controversial political figure, Asachi endorsed the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] presence in Moldavia and played a major part in establishing the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' regime, while supporting the rule of [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Mihail Sturdza]]. He thus came to clash with representatives of the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal current]], and opposed both the [[Moldavian revolution of 1848]] and the country's union with [[Wallachia]]. Engaged in a long polemic with the liberal leader [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], he was, together with [[Nicolae Vogoride]], involved in the unsuccessful attempt to block the unionist project through the means of an [[electoral fraud]]. Asachi was noted for his deep connections with the [[Western culture]], which led him to support the employment of foreign experts in various fields and educational institutions. He cultivated a relationship with the [[France|French]] historian [[Edgar Quinet]], whose father-in-law he became in 1852.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Asachi was born in [[Hertsa]], a small town which is now part of [[Ukraine]]. His family originated in [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]-ruled [[Transylvania]], where it was known under the name ''Asachievici''.&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.185; Djuvara, p.352&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Lazăr, was an [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest who kept close contacts with [[Metropolitan of Moldavia|Metropolitan]] [[Veniamin Costachi]];&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.185"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.185&lt;/ref&gt; according to several sources, he was of [[Armenians in Romania|Armenian]] (Aromanian) descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=11035&amp;print=true "Armenii în istorie şi cultură"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', retrieved June 3, 2007; "Urmaşii legendari ai lui Noe..."&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Elena (née Niculau or Ardeleanu) was herself the daughter of a Transylvanian priest.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.185"/&gt; The couple had another son, named Petru.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.185"/&gt; Lazăr Asachi was his son's first educator, after which the young Gheorghe most likely enrolled in the Church-run primary school in Herţa.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.185"/&gt;

In summer 1795, after deciding not to send Gheorghe and Petru to Moldavian Greek-language school in the capital city of [[Iaşi]], Lazăr Asachi opted to give them a more modern education in Austrian lands, sending them to [[Lviv|Lemberg]], where they attended [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]].&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.185"/&gt; After completing seven terms of education in [[Latin]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[German language|German]], Gheorghe Asachi entered university (the present-day [[Lviv University]]) at the age of 14.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.185"/&gt; He studied at the Faculty of Letters, Philosophy and Sciences (attending lectures in [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[ethics]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[natural history]], and [[architecture]]), but, in 1804, after two years of studies, he withdrew and returned to Moldavia.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.185"/&gt; Despite this, his level of familiarity with [[Western culture]] was arguably unparalleled in his native country during the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.185"/&gt; Over the following decades, he designed several lodgings in both his native country and [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]].&lt;ref name="Oprescu, p.29"&gt;Oprescu, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

His return followed the death of his mother and Lazăr Asachi's appointment as [[Protopope|First Protopope]] of the Moldavian Metropolitan Seat, and saw the family settling in Iaşi.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.185"/&gt;

===In Napoleonic Europe===
[[File:Vesuv fra stranden ved Castellammare.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Mount Vesuvius]] seen from [[Castellammare di Stabia]], 1821 painting by [[Johan Christian Dahl]]]]
In early 1805, Asachi fell ill with [[malaria]], and was helped by Metropolitan Veniamin to leave for [[Vienna]], where doctors had advised him to seek treatment.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.185"/&gt; As the recipient of a stately [[scholarship]], Asachi studied mathematics and [[astronomy]] with [[Tobie Bürg]], as well as pursuing training in the art of painting.&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.185; Oprescu, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

His time in the city coincided with [[First French Empire|French Empire]]'s successes in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and, most important, with the 1805 [[War of the Third Coalition]], during which ''[[La Grande Armée]]'' occupied Vienna; this allowed Asachi to familiarize himself with [[French Revolution]]ary and [[Liberalism and radicalism in France|liberal]] tenets, which he partly adopted in his political activities.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.186"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; In 1808, as the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Russo-Turkish War]] erupted, Moldavia was occupied by the [[Russian Empire]], First Protopope Lazăr contacted [[Pavel Chichagov]] to have his son appointed [[lieutenant]] and local head of the Corps of Engineers, but Gheorghe Asachi refused to assume office or even return from Vienna.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.186"/&gt; Instead, he left for the [[Italian Peninsula]] in April 1808, aiming to complete his studies in [[Rome]], but making long stops in other localities on the way (he notably visited [[Trieste]], [[Venice]], [[Padova]], [[Ferrara]], [[Bologna]] and [[Florence]]).&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.186"/&gt; Reaching the capital of the [[Papal States]] on June 11, Asachi left on August 19 to visit [[Naples]], [[Pompeii]], and other locations in the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. Upon reaching [[Mount Vesuvius]], he descended unaccompanied into the [[volcanic crater]], and was encouraged by a cheering audience.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.186"/&gt;

He soon after returned to Rome, where he focused on studying [[Renaissance Latin]] and [[Italian literature]], as well as taking classes in [[archeology]], painting and sculpture, and entering his most prolific phase in visual arts.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.186"/&gt; In 1809, while visiting an art shop near the [[Spanish Steps]], he met Bianca Milesi, the 19-year-old daughter of a wealthy merchant from [[Milan]], with whom he fell in love.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.186"/&gt; Despite her 1825 marriage to a French doctor, he was to remain her passionate admirer until her death from [[cholera]] in 1849.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.186"/&gt; He later stressed that she had been a major source of inspiration for him, especially in allowing him the transition "from painter to poet", while the literary critic [[Eugen Lovinescu]] believed she inspired Asachi's [[Romantic nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.186"/&gt;

At the time, he authored his first poems on [[Romanians|Romanian]] nationalist subjects, which earned him an award presented by the Roman Literary Society.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.186"/&gt; One of these was ''Viitorul'' ("The Future"), which voiced a call for national regeneration.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.187"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.187&lt;/ref&gt; Interested in the [[origin of the Romanians]] and the history of [[Roman Dacia]], Asachi studied events depicted on [[Trajan's Column]] and searched the [[Vatican Library]] for documents regarding the [[history of Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.186-187&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the latter research that he came across [[Dimitrie Cantemir]]'s ''[[History of the Growth and Decay of the Ottoman Empire]]'' in its English-language edition.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.187"/&gt;

Through Bianca Milesi, Asachi met [[Sextius Alexandre François de Miollis|François Miollis]], the French commander in Rome, who reportedly told him that [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] intended to emancipate Moldavia and [[Wallachia]] as a result of the [[French invasion of Russia (1812)|expedition into Russia]], and thus create a new "[[Dacia|Dacian Kingdom]]" in the area of present-day Romania.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.187"/&gt; Partly as a result of this encouragement, Asachi decided to travel back home on June 22, 1812, and, sailing down to [[Galaţi]], arrived in Iaşi on August 30.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.187"/&gt; His designs regarding French protection over the [[Danubian Principalities]] were ended by Napoleon's retreat from Russia, and by the restoration of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[suzerainty]] and [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] rules, when [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] appointed [[Scarlat Callimachi]] as [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]].&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.187"/&gt;

===Early lectures and mission to Vienna===
[[File:Giovanni Schiavoni - Gheorghe Asachi 2.jpg|thumb|220px|Portrait of a young Asachi, by [[Giovanni Schiavoni]]]]
In reaction to these developments, Gheorghe Asachi centered his attention on cultural improvements, [[Westernization]], and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] teachings, with support from Metropolitan Veniamin.&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.187-188; Diaconu&lt;/ref&gt; In 1813, his expertise and familiarity with European languages led Prince Callimachi to appoint him Reviewer (''Referandar'') for the Department of Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.188&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1814, increasingly opposed to the Greek-language teaching favored by the Phanariotes, Asachi proposed the first in a series of Romanian-language educational institutions, a course in [[engineering]] and [[topography]] to be held at the [[Princely Academy, Iaşi|Princely Academy]] in Iaşi;&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.188; Diaconu; Djuvara, p.215; Oprescu, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; once approved by the ruler and countersigned by Veniamin, the lectures attracted a number of young [[boyar]]s (including the future Ottoman diplomat [[Alexandros Kallimachis]], Scarlat's son, [[Teodor Balş]] (who was to serve as Moldavia's ''[[kaymakam]]'' in 1856-1857), [[Daniel Scavinschi]], as well as Gheorghe Asachi's brother Petru.&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.188; Diaconu&lt;/ref&gt; He gave various lectures, and offered additional training in drawing and [[art history]],&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.190; Drăguţ ''et al.'', p.112&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[History of Romania|Romanian history]].&lt;ref name="Diaconu"&gt;Diaconu&lt;/ref&gt; He organized several exhibits of his students' work in [[technical drawing]].&lt;ref name="Oprescu, p.29"/&gt; Despite a favorable report from its [[inspector]]s, Asachi's facility soon met with opposition from [[Greeks in Romania|Greek]] teachers at the Academy, which led it to be closed soon after its original students graduated (1819).&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.188-189&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Asachi was not stripped of his professorship, and was allowed to maintain both his position as head of the Princely Library and his house on Academy grounds.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.189"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.189&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same year, he was involved in reorganizing the Orthodox [[seminary]] at Iaşi's [[Socola Monastery]], and traveled to [[Transylvania]] in order to enlist the help of scholars active there.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.189"/&gt; His friendly relations with various leaders of the [[Transylvanian School]] helped in achieving this goal; in 1820, he returned to Moldavia accompanied by [[Vasile Fabian Bob]], [[Ioan Costa]], [[Ion Manfi]] and [[Vasile Pop]], all of whom became teachers at the Academy.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.189"/&gt;

Early in 1821, Gheorghe Asachi's activities were interrupted when the Greek [[Filiki Eteria]] forces crossed the [[Prut River]] and took over Moldavia on their way to Wallachia, during what constituted the earliest stage of the [[Greek War of Independence]]. Like his father (who died in 1825), Metropolitan Veniamin, and many other notable Moldavians, Asachi fled into Russian territory.&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.189, 192&lt;/ref&gt; He returned the following year, as the Ottoman Empire retook the region and put an end to Phanariote rules (a measure which attracted Asachi's enthusiasm);&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.193"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; the new prince, [[Ioan Sturdza]], appointed him Moldavian representative to the Austrian Empire, an office which he held between November 30, 1822 and February 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.189, 193&lt;/ref&gt; With this, he was awarded the [[Historical Romanian ranks and titles|traditional rank]] of ''[[Comis|Great Comis]]'', and thus joined the ranks of nobility.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.193"/&gt; As a diplomat, Asachi was foremost noted for his contacts with nationalist intellectuals who represented various ethnicities subject to the Austrian Empire.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.193"/&gt;

While in [[Vienna]], he met the [[Austrians|Austrian]] woman [[Elena Asachi|Elena Tauber]], former [[governess]] of the [[Sturdza family|Sturdza]] children and widow of the merchant Kiriako Melirato; she was his [[Concubinage|concubine]] until 1827, when they were married in an Orthodox church in Iaşi.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.193"/&gt; Tauber had three children from her marriage to Melirato &amp;mdash; a girl, Hermiona, and two boys, Alexandru and [[Dimitrie Asachi|Dimitrie]] (later, a mathematician); all of them were adopted by Asachi.&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"&gt;Ciubotaru&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Şcoala Vasiliană'' and ''Albina Românească''===
[[File:Albina Romaneasca - Coperta - Nr. 9 - 1 februarie 1840.jpg|thumb|220px|''[[Albina Românească]]'' issue no. 9, cover dated February 1, 1840]]
Soon after returning, Asachi was appointed caretaker of all Moldavian schools and ''[[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|Vel Agha]]''.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.189; Diaconu"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.189; Diaconu&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1828, he succeeded in opening a multilingual upper school and gymnasium, connected to the [[Trei Ierarhi Church]], named ''Şcoala Vasiliană'' or ''Gimnaziul Vasilian'' (in honor of the 17th-century prince [[Vasile Lupu]], who had created the original education institution on that site).&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.189; Diaconu"/&gt; It was the first modern institution of its kind in Moldavia, and was soon supplemented by a [[college]].&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.189"/&gt; ''Şcoala Vasiliană'' also continued the engineering course, taught by Gheorghe Filipescu, and had additional chairs in mathematics, architecture, [[applied mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]]; in 1834, it sent several of its alumni, including the architect [[Alexandru Costinescu]], for further studies abroad.&lt;ref name="Diaconu"/&gt; On July 19, 1827, a great fire in Iaşi's western quarter destroyed Asachi's lodging, as well as the vast majority of his possessions and manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt;

Upon the end of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829]], Moldavia and Wallachia again came under Russian administration. During that interval, Asachi decided to expand his educational goals and popularize new ideas through the means of press institutions, and requested approval from the Russian [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in Iaşi, [[Matvey Minciaky]], to have these set up.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.190"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.190&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1829, Russia endorsed his project for a magazine titled ''[[Albina Românească]]'', which first saw print in July of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.62; Cărăbuş, p.190; Ibrăileanu, ''Amestec de curente...''&lt;/ref&gt; The first periodical to be published in Moldavia, it ran its own [[printing press]], known as ''Institutul Albinei'' and originally housed in the Trei Ierarhi area.&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.189, 190; Ciubotaru&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside its stated goal (which involved generating a [[literary language]]), ''Albina Românească'' hosted pieces on current events, scientific essays, as well as articles offering practical advice.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.190"/&gt;

Over the following decades, it oversaw the publishing of several other magazines, which were originally designed as supplements;&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.191"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.191&lt;/ref&gt; among these, ''Alăuta Românească'' (1837–1838) and ''Foaea Sătească a Prinţipatului Moldovei'' (1839) were initiated by the younger activist [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], who, through his influential publication ''[[Dacia Literară]]'', become a vocal critic of Asachi's political and cultural views.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.62, 77; Cărăbuş, p.195; Ibrăileanu, ''Amestec de curente...''&lt;/ref&gt; First and foremost, Kogălniceanu expressed his dissatisfaction over the fact that ''Albina Românească'' relied on publishing translations from foreign authors, instead of encouraging national specificity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ibrăileanu, ''Amestec de curente...''&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Asachi also issued a large panel of related works, including a series of [[almanac]]s which ran between 1847 and 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.191-192&lt;/ref&gt; Another magazine created by Asachi, the short-lived ''Spicuitorul Moldo-Român'' (1841–1842), was published in both Romanian and [[French language|French]], having a Frenchman named Gallice, who worked as a teacher, for its co-editor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Iorga, ''La Révolution de 1848 et les émigrés''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Regulamentul Organic'' adoption===
In late 1829, through a framework first outlined in the [[Akkerman Convention]], Russian governor [[Peter Zheltukhin]] established a boards of experts from both countries, charged with drafting the [[constitution]]al project eventually known as ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]''. The project was delayed by the ongoing war and epidemics of cholera and [[bubonic plague]] until 1831-1832,&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p.122-123&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Pavel Kiselyov]] took over for Zheltukhin; Gheorghe Asachi served as secretary of the Moldavian board&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.189, 190, 193; Giurescu, p.123; Oprescu, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; the body also comprised [[Mihail Sturdza]], [[Iordache Catagiu]], [[Constantin Cantacuzino-Paşcanu]] and [[Costache Conachi]].&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.189, 190, 193&lt;/ref&gt;

The membership outlined for the Moldavian board scandalized the lesser boyars, who pointed out that the Akkerman treaties called for the new legislation to be adopted through a vote in a representative [[Sfatul boieresc|Boyar Divan]], and who attempted to have Asachi and Conachi recalled.&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.193-194&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the protests, the board continued its activities, being overseen by the former consul Minciaky; together with Mihail Sturdza and the Wallachian [[Alexandru Vilara]], Asachi was dispatched to [[Saint Petersburg]] to obtain the approval of [[List of Russian rulers|Emperor]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], which led to the document being enforced in both Principalities.&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.189, 190, 194&lt;/ref&gt; In its final version, the ''Regulament'' endorsed his efforts as educator, regulating [[public education]] and transferring assets donated by Vasile Lupu to ''Şcoala Vasiliană''.&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.189-190, 194&lt;/ref&gt;

The trade regulations offered by the ''Regulament'' were welcomed with enthusiasm by Asachi, prompting him to write an [[ode]] in their honor, titled ''Annul nou al moldo-românilor 1830, în care s-a lucrat Regulamentul organic, acel întâi cod administrativ al Moldovei'' ("The New Year of the Moldo-Romanians 1830, in Which ''Regulamentul Organic'', the First Administrative Code of Moldavia, Was Completed").&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.194"/&gt; In sharp contrast to his later advocacies, Asachi attempted to introduce provisions for the two Principalities' union, and some of his interventions in the text were meant to facilitate this project.&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.196, 199&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he took a compassionate view in respect to peasants, denouncing the exploitation of their labor by the boyars.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş198"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.198&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under Mihail Sturdza===
Gheorghe Asachi was heavily impressed by the institutions he saw functioning in the Russian capital, and did his best to replicate them in Moldavia.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.194"/&gt; After his return from Russia, Asachi became head of the Moldavian National Archives, in which capacity he published the first collection of documents referring to the country's history.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.190"/&gt; From early 1834 onwards, he was a main collaborator of the newly appointed prince and former colleague on the Moldavian board, Mihail Sturdza, receiving funds and benefiting from on order to prioritize education in "Moldavian" (Romanian).&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.190, 194&lt;/ref&gt;

In July of the same year, Asachi visited the Wallachian capital of [[Bucharest]], being charged by Minciaky with strengthening the common framework of the ''Regulament'' by ensuring that its two versions did not differ in content.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.194"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.194&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1833, he was able to move into a new house, which he designed and erected in the ''Muntenimea'' area of [[Copou Hill]], on a large plot of land he had purchased from [[Lupu Balş]]; at around the same time, ''Institutul Albinei'' was also reopened on the new location.&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt; An 1852 survey showed that Asachi had a second, smaller, house in downtown Iaşi.&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt;

In late 1834, on Asachi's request, Sturdza gave approval for the first Moldavian girls' school to be opened in the capital.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.190; Diaconu"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.190; Diaconu&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 1835, following Asachi's interventions, ''[[Academia Mihăileană]]'', the first Romanian-language institution of [[higher education]], was established in the city.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.190; Diaconu"/&gt; A fundamental institution of higher learning, and the nucleus for the present-day [[University of Iaşi]], it also hosted lectures by cultural figures from Moldavia, Transylvania and Wallachia alike, including some of Asachi's young rivals; among the teachers were [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], [[Ion Ionescu de la Brad]], [[Eftimie Murgu]], [[Ion Ghica]], and [[August Treboniu Laurian]].&lt;ref name="Diaconu"/&gt; In addition, Asachi presented a plan to create a school of [[agronomy]], to function alongside the city's military academy, and, by 1848, created a school for further qualification in engineering.&lt;ref name="Diaconu"/&gt;

On November 15, 1836, he founded, alongside ''[[Vornic]]'' [[Ştefan Catargiu]] and ''[[Spătar]]'' Alecsandri (the father of poet [[Vasile Alecsandri]]), a [[College or university school of music|conservatory]], and, after 1837, was appointed head of the [[National Theatre Iaşi|Moldavian Theater]], among the first of its kind to showcase original pieces in Romanian.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.190, 192"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.190, 192&lt;/ref&gt; At the head of a committee, he took charge of translating a [[German language|German-language]] [[dictionary]] into Romanian, stressing that this was a response to the Moldavians' need for knowledge.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; During the early 1840s, he became interested in organizing education for the [[Political emancipation|non-emancipated]] [[Armenians in Romania|Armenian]] and [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] communities &amp;mdash; in 1842, it was as a result of his efforts that an Armenian primary school was set up.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.190"/&gt;

In 1847, Asachi's printing press issued an [[Armenian language|Armenian-language]] [[Primer (textbook)|primer]].&lt;ref&gt;"Urmaşii legendari ai lui Noe..."&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the person behind the creation of the Iaşi School of Arts and Crafts (January 1841), as well as helping establish the first [[public library]], the [[paper mill]] near [[Piatra Neamţ]], an Art Gallery and a National History Museum.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.190, 192"/&gt; In the meantime, ''Academia Mihăileană'' was disestablished and transformed into a French-language school (overseen by a teacher named Malgouverné).&lt;ref&gt;Oprescu, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the same decade, Asachi moved towards [[Conservatism]], defending ''Regulamentul Organic'' in front of the increasingly popular [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal current]].&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.194, 198; Ibrăileanu, ''Amestec de curente...''&lt;/ref&gt; He clashed with young activists who rejected Sturdza's rule, and, as early as 1839, noted with dissatisfaction that "a new people was born [...], with new wishes and ideas".&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.194"/&gt; His conflict with Kogălniceanu was transported to the field of politics, and Asachi joined in condemning the anti-''Regulament'' [[Moldavian revolution of 1848|failed rebellion of 1848]].&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.194-195"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.194-195&lt;/ref&gt; As most other press venues submitted to the minimal requirement of Russian officials and avoided publishing any material related to the revolution, ''Albina Românească'' criticized the revolutionaries for having discarded "their duty to the powers that be", and praised Russia for sending its troops to combat "[[Anomie|anarchy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.195; Ibrăileanu, ''Amestec de curente...''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Kogălniceanu later claimed that, on one occasion, he had seen Asachi sobbing over having been made to criticize the Romanian activists.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrăileanu, ''Evoluţia spiritului critic...''&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate prolonged itself over the following years, and, coupled with Asachi's unwaivering support for Sturdza, saw him joining the [[Separatism|separatist]] camp at a time the post-revolutionary group ''[[Partida Naţională]]'' began openly campaigning for Moldo-Wallachian unification.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.47-48; Cărăbuş, p.196&lt;/ref&gt; While supporting the interests of the [[middle class]], Asachi stressed that these could compliment a [[Feudalism|feudal system]], and rejected the revolutionary call for abolishing [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]].&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş198"/&gt;

Also in 1848, Asachi lost his daughter, the 19-year-old Eufrosina, to the [[cholera]] outbreak.&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt; He published two poems written in her memory.&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt;

===1850s===
In January 1850, almost one year after the [[Convention of Balta Liman]] awarded the Moldavian throne to the reform-minded and revolutionary sympathizer [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]], ''Albina Românească'' changed its name to ''Gazeta de Moldavia'', adopting an official tone.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.191"/&gt; Asachi, who resigned his positions as inspector and archivist in 1849, was awarded a substantial [[pension]].&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.195"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.195&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1851 and 1854, he was head of [[censorship]], using this position to award ''[[imprimatur]]'' for reformist ideas (with Prince Ghica's tacit approval).&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.195"/&gt; At the time, he gave endorsement to the ''[[Chronicle of Huru]]'', a document which was claimed to trace a direct lineage between [[Roman Dacia]] and Moldavia, and to clarify the more mysterious aspects of the country's [[Romania in the Early Middle Ages|early medieval history]] &amp;mdash; the document was used by separatists to emphasize Moldavia's tradition of independence, but was the subject to an inquiry and dismissed by Kogălniceanu (it was later established that the text was a forgery).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.47-49&lt;/ref&gt;

During the political battles which followed Ghica's retirement and the [[Crimean War]], ''Gazeta de Moldavia'' transformed itself into an official platform for the anti-unionist camp.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.191"/&gt; After the retreat of Russian troops and an interval of Austrian administration, Moldavia and Wallachia's government came under the direct supervision of various European powers, and ''[[Kaymakam]]'' [[Teodor Balş]] ensured the interregnum in Iaşi. In this context, Ottoman authorities, through the voice of [[Keçecizade Mehmet Fuat Pasha|Fuat Pasha]], gave their approval for relative [[freedom of the press]] to be legislated.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.195"/&gt; With [[Costache Negruzzi]], Asachi again became an official censor, while again assuming the offices of archivist and inspector of Moldavian schools.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.195"/&gt;

As the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] imposed the creation of [[ad hoc Divan]]s, through which the two countries' inhabitants were allowed to decide their future, the unionist camp saw a chance for fulfilling its goals; Asachi and his associates reacted vehemently, and, in May 1857, complained to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] that unification would bring about various perils.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.196"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.196&lt;/ref&gt; One month later, the government of ''Kaymakam'' [[Nicolae Vogoride]] carried out an [[electoral fraud]] to yield a separatist majority in the ad hoc Divan &amp;mdash; Asachi, who supported Sturdza's bid for the throne, is thought to have played a major part in bringing this about, and, together with Vogoride himself, [[Nicolae Istrati]], and the Austrian consul [[Oskar von Gödel-Lannoy]], to have drawn up falsified the electoral lists.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.196"/&gt; He was himself a candidate in the Iaşi [[electoral college]], receiving 197 votes and placing himself second among the representatives it sent to the Divan.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.197"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.197&lt;/ref&gt; His magazine stood alone in claiming that the regime had acted impartially.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.191"/&gt;

The suffrage was hotly contested and annulled through an agreement between the [[Second French Empire]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]; Asachi himself was thus forced to note that the new elections in August managed to overturn the previous results.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.191, 197"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.191, 197&lt;/ref&gt; He was no longer elected a deputy, and his candidature for the position of secretary of the electoral board was awarded just one vote.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.197"/&gt; In 1858, ''Gazeta de Moldavia'' was entirely dedicated to political subjects and support for Vogoride's policies, and ceased print in October, as the ''Kaymakam'' ended his mandate.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.191"/&gt; In late November, it reemerged under the title ''Patria'', which continued to criticize ''Partida Naţională'' from a conservative position, notably hosting articles by the anti-unionist Istrati.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.191"/&gt; As a new [[Regent|regency]] of three was preparing elections, the magazine rallied with [[Ştefan Catargiu]], Asachi's lifelong collaborator and the separatist representative in the body of ''kaymakams'', against the two unionists ([[Vasile Sturdza]] and [[Anastasie Panu]]), before Catargiu was replaced with [[I. A. Cantacuzino]].&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.191, 197"/&gt; In November 1837, Asachi and another 36 separatist boyars issued a memorandum unsuccessfully asking the Ottoman [[List of Ottoman Grand Viziers|Grand Vizier]] [[Mehmed Emin Aali Pasha|Aali Pasha]] to intervene against the unionist ''kaymakams'', restore censorship, and to narrow down the electoral lists.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.197"/&gt;

===Final years===
[[File:Gh Asachi, portret din editia nuvelelor ILR 94.jpeg|thumb|200px|Asachi in old age (portrait originally printed in the first edition of his collected short stories)]]
The situation changed in January 1859, when ''Partida Naţională'' was able to ensure the election of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] as both Prince of Moldavia and [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince of Wallachia]], in what was the [[de facto]] union of the two countries. After congratulating Cuza on his accomplishment, Asachi authored a pome titled ''Odă la Dumnezeu'' ("An Ode to God"), which proclaimed the brotherhood of Romanians and the notion that "power resides in Unity".&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.197"/&gt; ''Patria'' drastically reduced its articles in support of separation, while allocating most of its space to reprinting official papers.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.191"/&gt; Nevertheless, as ''[[Domnitor]]'' Cuza was deposed and the election of a foreign ruler over the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Principality]] was being assessed, it is probable that Gheorghe Asachi again switched to a separatist stance: on April 14, 1866, after an incident during which Iaşi crowds protested the prolongation of unification beyond Cuza's reign, he was the subject of an inquiry on charges of [[sedition]].&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.197"/&gt; This remains a mysterious aspect of his political career, and it is certain that Asachi eventually rallied with Carol later in the year.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.197"/&gt; It is likely, however, that his inconsistent views prompted other intellectuals to reject his participation in founding the [[Romanian Academy]].&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.197"/&gt;

The various projects also involved Asachi's own financial reserves, which led him to become indebted and [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] his assets on several occasions: in 1862, after Asachi was declared [[Insolvency|insolvent]], the Copou house was put up for [[auction]], but the writer was able to come up with the money before the sale was perfected.&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt; He continued to depend on debts in order to feed his family, and unsuccessfully offered ''Institutul Albinei'' to be purchased by the state.&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt; In February 1869, the [[Dimitrie Ghica]] government awarded Asachi a yearly pension of 8,888 [[Romanian leu|lei]], "for the important services he has brought to the country from 1813 to 1862".&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.197"/&gt; He died several months later in Iaşi, and was buried at the [[Holy Forty Martyrs Church, Iași|Patruzeci de Sfinţi Church]].&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.198; Ciubotaru"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.198; Ciubotaru&lt;/ref&gt; His printing press ceased its activity in 1867.&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt;

==Literature==

===Style and subjects===
During his youth, Asachi was one of the most representative members of an [[Idealism|idealist]] generation of Moldavian [[intellectual]]s.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.194-195"/&gt; In the context of early [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]], where [[Romanticism]] and delayed [[Classicism]] coexisted, Asachi, like [[Grigore Alexandrescu]], [[George Baronzi]] and others, tended to side with the latter,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.53-56; Măciucă, p. XXI&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when his counterpart in [[Bucharest]], [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]], bridged the gap between the two schools.&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, p. XXI&lt;/ref&gt; The literary critic [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]] concluded that Asachi's literature signified a transition between a Classicist stage exemplified by [[Costache Conachi]] and younger Romantics such as [[Vasile Alecsandri]] and [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]] (he also concluded that the casual comparisons made between Heliade Rădulescu and Asachi had failed to note that the former was not a conservative).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Gheorghe Asachi recommended his students to study [[Italian literature]], and would frown upon models inspired by [[French literature]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

His creation comprised poems, the first of which were written in [[Italian language|Italian]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.53; Ibrăileanu, ''Amestec de curente...''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as vast array of short stories and [[novella]]s, through which Asachi attempted to create a legendary history partly mirroring [[Romanian mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.54, 55&lt;/ref&gt; The major influences on his work were [[Renaissance literature|Renaissance]] authors such as [[Petrarch]], [[Ludovico Ariosto]], and [[Torquato Tasso]], but he also accommodated more modern influences, such as [[Salvator Rosa]], [[Thomas Gray]], [[Gottfried August Bürger]], [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.53-54, 55, 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Asachi created himself a [[fictional location]], called ''Dochia'' &amp;mdash; a reference to both [[Dacia]] and the myth of [[Baba Dochia]], which houses the [[Ceahlău Massif]] under the name of ''Pion''.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.54-55&lt;/ref&gt; Asachi was also the first person to mention Baba Dochia in connection to the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Trajan]] and the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]] &amp;mdash; the vague and unprecedented references make it likely that he actually invented the original story as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Carmen Pleşa, [http://old.jurnalul.ro/articol_42633/stanca_dochia.html "Stânca Dochia"], in ''[[Jurnalul Naţional]]'', December 19, 2005; retrieved June 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; References to this universe are also present in an eponymous novella about [[Dragoş]], the first [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince of Moldavia]], which partly drew on old [[chronicle]]s, and partly displayed Asachi's own fictional devices.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.55"&gt;Călinescu, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; The story centers on Harboe, a [[Chivalry|chivalrous]] [[Tatars|Tatar]] ruler who resides in the [[Cumania]]n town of [[Romidava]], who falls in love with Branda, the daughter of a [[Moesia]]n lord and would-be wife of Dragoş.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.55"/&gt; Dochia's hidden [[altar]], referred to as "a [[simulacrum]]", is guarded by a [[Vesta (mythology)|Vestal]]-like priestess and a [[Deer|deer hind]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.55"/&gt; Asachi's other prose works on historical subjects take similar liberties with their subjects (they notably describe large [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] monuments and [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] in medieval Moldavia, as well as improbable details from the lives of 14th-16th century Princes [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan I]], [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], and [[Petru Rareş]]).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.55-56&lt;/ref&gt;

Asachi's works also include romanticized accounts of a journey made by the [[Cossack]] [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman]] [[Ivan Mazepa]] into Moldavia (''Mazepa în Moldova'') and the life of Ruxandra, daughter of [[Vasile Lupu]] and wife of [[Tymofiy Khmelnytsky]] (''Rucsandra Doamna''), as well as ''Jijia'', where a captured [[fairy]] recounts her previous existence as a [[Christian martyrs|Christian martyr]], and ''Sirena lacului'', where a dishonored maiden, who has turned into a [[Siren (mythology)|siren]], takes revenge on boyar.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.55, 56&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with [[Nicolae Vogoride]]'s policies, Asachi drew on historical subject to counter the calls for unity voiced by ''[[Partida Naţională]]''; in addition to the endorsement he gave to the ''[[Chronicle of Huru]]'', he emphasized, in an article of June 1857, the campaign led by Stephen the Great into Wallachia, calling for a landmark to be raised in honor of "the vanquisher of the Wallachians".&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.196"/&gt; This mirrored the earlier comments made by the Wallachian anti-unionist [[Dimitrie Papazoglu]], who proposed a celebration and monument honoring the 1653 [[Battle of Finta]] (during which the Wallachian forces of [[Matei Basarab]] had defeated an army of Moldavians and Cossacks).&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.196"/&gt;

Gheorghe Asachi's style has been criticized from the time of his debate with other intellectuals of his age, when [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]] argued that his lyrical works were mere replicas of foreign models.&lt;ref name="Zarifopol"&gt;Zarifopol&lt;/ref&gt; Several influential literary historians of the 20th century expressed similar views: [[George Călinescu]] indicated that, in general, poems by Asachi sounded "banal";&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; in one of his essays, [[Paul Zarifopol]] commented that Asachi and his generation, from [[Iancu Văcărescu]] to [[Vasile Cârlova]], [[Alexandru Hrisoverghi]], and Heliade Rădulescu, were "semi-cultured" and "amateurs".&lt;ref name="Zarifopol"/&gt; Both Călinescu and Zarifopol stressed that, in his best work, Asachi announced the poetic language of [[Mihai Eminescu]], the most influential author of the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.54; Zarifopol&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Present at the forefront during debates regarding the shape of [[literary language]], Asachi drew criticism for introducing [[archaism]]s and marginally used [[neologism]]s to the [[Romanian lexis]], as well as for the forms of spelling he encouraged. Commenting on a series of words which are nowhere used outside his novellas and poems, George Călinescu called them "impossible [...], presently seeming bizarre, mostly [[Romanticism|Romantic]], lacking in historical perception".&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.55"/&gt;

In essence, Asachi called for the modern language to reflect as much as possible the one used by the folk &amp;mdash; in this respect, he came closer to Kogălniceanu's views than to those of Heliade Rădulescu (at a time when the latter favored using the dialects employed by the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] and [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]] churches).&lt;ref&gt;Ibrăileanu, ''Veacul al XIX-lea...''&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first to discover old Moldavian chronicles and recommend them for reading, he came to propose that the [[Romanian dialects|Moldavian dialect]], as reflected in these, could be used as a template for the modern speech.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrăileanu, ''Recunoaşterea necesităţii criticii...''&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, his views fluctuated, and he was noted for proposing himself that the Church language be used as a template, while contrasting the support he gave to [[Westernization]] in general with his distaste for popular French-sounding neologisms.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In an article he published in 1847, Asachi defined himself as a partisan of "the ''[[juste milieu]]''" on language matters, and recommended adopting words and rules of grammar with moderation, and from all sources available.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to the literary critic [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], "[...] anybody who has ever read anything of what this writer has authored knows that he has a language of his own, a characteristic one, resembling those of many writers, without resemblig that of anyone else to the point where we could place him in any category."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The same commentator nonetheless noted that there were clear similarities between the way in which Asachi used Romanian and the language favored by [[Costache Conachi]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

His enduring aversion towards Western neologisms, as well as towards the [[Latin]]-based [[linguistic purism]] favored by many [[Transylvania]]n scholars, made Asachi a predecessor of the [[Bukovina]]n academic [[Aron Pumnul]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, in his later years, Asachi came to praise and uphold Heliade Rădulescu's controversial advocacy in favor of modifying Romanian on the basis of Italian (with its claim that the two languages were in fact closely related dialects of Latin).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:Iasi.National.Theathre.JPG|thumb|300px|The [[Iaşi National Theatre]]]]
Asachi's experimentations with the [[Romanian alphabet|Romanian Latin alphabet]] were noted for their inconsistencies, and criticized as such by Kogălniceanu (who, as an example, pointed out that Asachi had alternatively used "tch", "tz", "c", and "cz" to mark the [[voiceless postalveolar affricate]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Asachi and the Romanian theater===
Considered, together with the Wallachian Heliade Rădulescu, the founder of early [[Theater of Romania|Romanian theater]],&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''La Monarchie de juillet et les Roumains''; Măciucă, p. XII&lt;/ref&gt; Asachi produced the first staging of a Romanian-language play, first performed for the public on December 27, 1816, at the [[Ghica family]] manor.&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.192; Djuvara, p.311&lt;/ref&gt; The work was his own adaptation of ''Myrtil et Chloé'', a [[pastoral]] theme authored by [[Solomon Gessner]] and retaken by [[Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian]];&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.192; Djuvara, p.311; Iorga, ''La Monarchie de juillet et les Roumains''&lt;/ref&gt; in its printed version, the text also featured illustrations drawn by his own hand.&lt;ref name="Drăguţ et al., p.113"&gt;Drăguţ ''et al.'', p.113&lt;/ref&gt; Extremely popular, Asachi's play was celebrated for helping to counter the perceived [[xenophily]] of the early 19th century Moldavian cultural environment.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.192"&gt;Cărăbuş, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; Two Ghicas and a Sturdza were assigned parts in the first staging, and [[Veniamin Costachi]] was present in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.311&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1837, his [[College or university school of music|conservatory]] began functioning regularly, which coincided with Asachi's leadership of the [[Iaşi National Theatre|National Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.192"/&gt; Before and after this moment, the writer contributed translations from various prestigious dramatists and playwrights, [[August von Kotzebue]], [[Voltaire]], [[Jean Racine]] and [[Nikolai Gogol]] among them.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.192"/&gt; In parallel, he published [[libretto]]s for popular [[opera]]s, thus lending a hand to the development of local operatic theater.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.192"/&gt;

==Contribution to visual arts==
[[File:AsachiTemplulIubirii.jpg|thumb|300px|''Templul Iubirii'' ("The Temple of Love"), drawing by Gheorghe Asachi]]
As a teacher, Asachi assisted and encouraged the development of [[Art of Romania|Romanian art]]. Before he came to exercise his influence, Moldavian art was essentially dependent on [[boyar]] [[patronage]], and, by the turn of the 18th century, had come to focus on [[portrait painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Drăguţ ''et al.'', p.112; Oprescu, p.26-28&lt;/ref&gt; Asachi centered his energies on introducing [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalist]] themes and popularizing new trends.&lt;ref name="Drăguţ et al., p.112"&gt;Drăguţ ''et al.'', p.112&lt;/ref&gt; He integrated painting, architecture, and drawing and [[oil painting]] in classes taught at ''[[Academia Mihăileană]]'' (called ''class de zugrăvie'', an antiquated version of "painting course"), and introduced [[lithography]] through the means of his printing press.&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.190; Drăguţ ''et al.'', p.112; Oprescu, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1830s and 1840s, he encouraged artists the copying and publishing of paintings and drawings with [[History painting|historical themes]].&lt;ref&gt;Cărăbuş, p.190; Drăguţ ''et al.'', p.112; Oprescu, p.30-31&lt;/ref&gt; Asachi emphasized the educational aspects of ''zugrăvitura istorică în oloiu'' ("history painting in oil"), and intended its creations to reach as wide an audience as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Drăguţ ''et al.'', p.112; Oprescu, p.30-31&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect as well, his contributions were equivalent to those of Heliade Rădulescu, who opened the first museum in Wallachia (1837).&lt;ref&gt;Oprescu, p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting works are generally [[Naïve art|naïve]] in quality, and inaccurate in their reconstruction of historical scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Oprescu, p.31, 43&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gheorghe Panaiteanu Bardasare]], the recipient of a [[scholarship]] to the ''[[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Akademie der Bildenden Künste]]'' in [[Munich]], was the only one of his many disciples to remain under the influence of Asachi's tenets for the rest of his life, developing these into [[academic art]].&lt;ref&gt;Drăguţ ''et al.'', p.125-126&lt;/ref&gt; Asachi's disciples also included [[Gheorghe Lemeni]], who studied in Munich and [[Rome]], and the minor artist Gheorghe Năstăseanu.&lt;ref&gt;Drăguţ ''et al.'', p.125; Oprescu, p.47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, Asachi's most important contribution to the artistic field was his involvement in attracting foreign painters to the Moldavian scene, by offering them commissions or educational assignments; among these were the [[Poles|Polish]] [[Ludwik Stawski]] and Mauriciu Loeffler, the [[Italians|Italian]] [[Giovanni Schiavoni]],&lt;ref&gt;Drăguţ ''et al.'', p.113-114; Oprescu, p.29, 30&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Austrians|Austrian]] Josef Adler (noted for authoring an 1833 manual for [[landscape painting]] and [[still life]] works) and Ioan Müller (who taught [[figurative art]]).&lt;ref&gt;Oprescu, p.29, 44-49&lt;/ref&gt; Of them, Asachi reportedly considered Schiavoni to be the most competent, while he tended to replace most others after reexamining their skills.&lt;ref&gt;Oprescu, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Another important Italian artist who arrived in Iaşi during that period was the former ''[[Carbonari|Carboneria]]'' revolutionary [[Niccoló Livaditti]], to whom Asachi did not, however, assign a teaching post.&lt;ref&gt;Drăguţ ''et al.'', p.114&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843, four years before the Iaşi ''Academia'' was radically transformed, the art classes were disestablished due to the protest of various boyars (who objected to the fact that members of all social groups could attend them).&lt;ref&gt;Oprescu, p.32-33&lt;/ref&gt;

Gheorghe Asachi's own works, many of which date back to the time he spent in [[Rome]], show the influence of [[Classicism]].&lt;ref name="Drăguţ et al., p.113"/&gt; Noted for their rigorous use of artistic conventions and nature study, they are nonetheless considered inferior to both their creator's contributions to other cultural fields and the works of other many painters active in Moldavia at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Drăguţ ''et al.'', p.112; Oprescu, p.43-44&lt;/ref&gt; Asachi himself is known to have sketched out works which were completed by his foreign collaborators or students (among these is a since-lost painting of [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] facing his mother, signed by the Italian artist Giani, and an 1845 painting of Moldavians in the battle of [[Malbork Castle]]).&lt;ref&gt;Oprescu, p.43-44&lt;/ref&gt; A series of Classicist drawings from the early decades of the 19th century have only tentatively been attributed to Asachi.&lt;ref name="Drăguţ et al., p.112"/&gt;

==Descendants==
Elena, Gheorghe Asachi's widow, died in 1877.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.198; Ciubotaru"/&gt; Of his adopted children, [[Dimitrie Asachi]] was to be the most famous: a pupil of his stepfather's, he was to author the first original book on mathematics in his country (1841).&lt;ref name="Diaconu"/&gt; Alexandru Asachi, who joined the [[Romanian Army]] and became an officer,&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt; was himself known as an artist: a lithographer and author of historical works, he published several albums of hand-colored prints during the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Oprescu, p.88-89&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, Hermiona Asachi (whose given name was often [[Francization|Francised]] as ''Hermione'')  fell in love with Alexandru, the underage son of former Prince [[Alexander Mourousis]], who soon after moved into Asachi's house; this scandalized other members of the [[Mourousis family]], and the conflict was ended only when the two youths agreed to marry.&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt; They had a son, George Moruzi, who died in 1856.&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt; In 1843, Hermiona translated and published [[Silvio Pellico]]'s collection of maxims, ''[[Dei doveri degli uomini]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alin Ciupală, ''Femeia în societatea românească a secolului al XIX-lea'', [[Editura Meridiane]], Bucharest, 2003, p.76-77&lt;/ref&gt; She got married a second time, in 1852, to the well-known French historian [[Edgar Quinet]]&lt;ref&gt;Ciubotaru; Davier; Djuvara, p.352; Iorga, ''La Révolution de 1848 et les émigrés''&lt;/ref&gt; (between 1841 and 1845, she had attended Quinet's lectures at the [[Collège de France]]);&lt;ref&gt;Davier&lt;/ref&gt; five years later, Asachi translated and Quinet's collected works into Romanian &amp;mdash; according to historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], the edition was toned-down and censored.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The Quinets did not have any children.&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt;

==Landmarks and portrayals==

In autumn 1890, a statue of Asachi was erected in front of the [[Trei Ierarhi Church]] school complex, an initiative taken by a group of his conservative collaborators.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.198; Ciubotaru"/&gt; On the same occasion, Asachi's remains, together with those of his wife Elena, were placed in the monument's base.&lt;ref name="Cărăbuş, p.198; Ciubotaru"/&gt; The courtyard of Asachi's house on [[Copou Hill]] hosts a small monument, which he raised to the memory of his daughter Eufrosina and his grandson George.&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt;

Asachi laid out the plan for a monument honoring ''Regulamentul Organic'', completed by the Russian artist Sungurov with workforce hired from [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], and raised on Copou as the first structure of its kind in Moldavia.&lt;ref&gt;Oprescu, p.49, 50&lt;/ref&gt; He is also noted for having proposed, in 1853, to create a modern [[cemetery]] in Iaşi on [[Galata Hill]] &amp;mdash; his project was never used, but in 1871, [[Eternitatea cemetery|Eternitatea]], a cemetery corresponding to his requirements, was set up on land donated to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Silvia Craus, [http://www.ieseanul.ro/articol/ziar/iasi/pietrele-vorbitoare/9202/ "Pietrele vorbitoare"], in ''[[Ieşeanul]]'', February 7, 2007; retrieved July 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Copou house itself was taken over by Malvina Czapkai, a creditor of Asachi and his son Alexandru; it served as a [[boarding school]], and, during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878]], as a Russian military hospital.&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt; In 1892, [[Marie of Edinburgh]], who had just married the Romanian [[heir apparent]], [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand Hohenzollern]], purchased it for 52,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]].&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt; It was subsequently the Principesa Maria School for Arts and Crafts, destined to women's education, and, during [[World War I]], served as a home for orphaned girls.&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt; In 1937, Queen Marie transformed into an institute for [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], which notably hosted the practice of sociologist and psychologist [[Mihai Ralea]].&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt; The house was again a hospital in [[World War II]], when it was taken over by the [[Romanian Air Force]]; in 1948, when the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] was established, it was [[Nationalization|nationalized]] (together with all other [[King of Romania|Royal]] property), and served as the headquarters of the [[Romanian Land Forces]] 4th Corps, and was later rented for private use.&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt; Since 1976, it has housed two institutes of the [[Romanian Academy]] (the [[Alexandru Philippide]] Institute of Philology and the [[Gheorghe Zane]] Institute of Economic and Social Research).&lt;ref name="Ciubotaru"/&gt;

Among the artists two have depicted Asachi during his lifetime were his associate Giovanni Schiavoni (whose painting shows the young writer surrounded by objects illustrating his many interests)&lt;ref&gt;Drăguţ ''et al.'', p.113-114; Oprescu, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Constantin Daniel Stahi]] (a pupil of Panaiteanu Berdasare).&lt;ref&gt;Drăguţ ''et al.'', p.160&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1937, a section of the [[University of Iaşi]] was created into an [[institute of technology]], with the name of ''Gheorghe Asachi Polytechnic School'' (the present-day [[Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iaşi]]).&lt;ref name="Diaconu"/&gt; A [[public library]] in the city also bears his name, as do a school erected in 1900 on the site previously occupied by ''Şcoala Vasiliană'' and high schools in the Romanian cities of [[Botoşani]] and [[Sibiu]], as well as in the [[Moldova]]n capital [[Chişinău]].

'''Gin'nnah Muhammad''' (pronounced /jenna)  (born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]],  July, 1963), is a [[Muslim]] [[African American]] woman who was dismissed from a [[Michigan]] small claims court in 2006 by a judge because she was wearing a veil (as required under [[Islam]]). The judge claimed he needed to see her face to assess her truthfulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CEFD7153BF93BA25755C0A96F9C8B63| work=[[The New York Times]]| agency=[[Associated Press]]| date=June 18, 2009| title=Michigan Judges Can Regulate Dress in Court| accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Mich.: Witnesses May Have To Remove Veil| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/17/national/main5093829.shtml| work=[[CBS News]]| date=June 17, 2009| accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Gin'nnah Muhammad went on to the [[Michigan Supreme Court]] and spoke to the panel of judges wearing her veil. The result was that the court ruled that judges could regulate the clothing of witnesses.

The '''Grand prix des lectrices de Elle''' is a [[French language|French]] literary prize awarded by readers of the ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazine. 

==History==
Unlike other literary prizes that have professionals for their juries and selection committees, the Grand prix des lectrices de Elle is a public award, convened and selected by readers of the magazine, and aimed at giving a voice to women who love to read. At its inception in 1969 by [[Hélène Lazareff]], it was awarded solely to novels.&lt;ref name=lexpress12/&gt; From 1977, two categories were recognised - [[literary fiction]] and [[non-fiction]]. From 2002, [[crime fiction]] also came to be awarded.&lt;ref name=lepoint10/&gt;

Until 1992, eight regional committees designated at the first instance books of the month. A national jury then took over to elect the two major prizewinners in the categories of novels and non-fiction. Currently, eight monthly juries of fifteen readers each form the grand jury of 120 readers.&lt;ref name=lexpress12/&gt;

The [[editor]] of the Elle magazine makes an initial selection of books, emphasising first works or young authors or new publishers, and systematically eliminating the works that have already won major literary awards such as the [[Prix Goncourt]], [[Prix Femina]] or the [[Prix Médicis]]. After this, every month from September to April, the eight juries of fifteen readers of Elle magazine deliberate to select their finalists, which in turn will be read by all the juries to select the grand winner in May.

'''Herbert William Mullin''' (born April 18, 1947) is an American [[serial killer]] who killed thirteen people in [[California]] in the early 1970s. He confessed to the killings, which he claimed prevented [[earthquake]]s. In 1973, after a trial to determine whether he was [[Insanity defense|insane]] or [[Culpability|culpable]], he was convicted of two [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees|murders in the first degree]] and nine in the second, and sentenced to [[Life imprisonment in the United States|life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="trutv"&gt;{{cite web |last= Scott |first= Shirley Lynn |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121210085548/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/mullin/index_1.html |archive-date= 2012-12-10 |title= Unnatural Disasters |work= truTV Crime Library |url= http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/mullin/index_1.html |publisher= crimelibrary.com |accessdate= 2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Mullin was born in [[Salinas, California]] but grew up in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]]. His father, a [[World War II]] veteran, was strict but not [[child abuse|abusive]] and frequently discussed his heroic war activities. Mullin had numerous friends at school and was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" by his classmates. Shortly after graduating from [[San Lorenzo Valley High School]], however, one of his best friends was killed in a car accident, and Mullin was devastated.&lt;ref name="schechter" /&gt; He built a shrine to his deceased friend in his bedroom. Later he expressed fears that he was [[homosexual]], even though he had a longtime girlfriend at the time.

In 1969, at the age of 21, Mullin allowed his family to commit him to a [[mental hospital]]. Over the next few years, he entered various institutions, but discharged himself after only a short stay. He extinguished cigarettes on his own skin, attempted to enter the [[priesthood]], and got evicted from an apartment after he repeatedly pounded on the floor, shouting at people who were not there.

Many years later, [[FBI]] profiler [[Robert K. Ressler]] said Mullin had [[paranoid schizophrenia]], manifesting as early as his senior year of high school, and could have been accelerated by the use of [[LSD]] or [[amphetamines]].&lt;REF NAME=RESSLER&gt;Ressler, Robert K. and Tom Schachtman. ''Whoever Fights Monsters: My Twenty Years Hunting Serial Killers for the FBI.''  New York: St. Martin's Press, 1992, pp. 127-132.  {{ISBN|0-312-07883-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murder spree ==
By 1972, Mullin was 25 and had moved back in with his parents in Felton, California (located in the Santa Cruz mountains).  By now he was hearing voices in his head that told him an earthquake was imminent, and that only through human sacrifice could he save California.  Mullin's birthday, April 18, was the anniversary of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], which he thought was very significant.

Mullin believed that the [[Vietnam War]] had produced enough American death to forestall earthquakes as a sort of blood sacrifice to nature, but that with the war winding down by late 1972, he would need to start killing people in order to have enough deaths to keep the earthquake away.&lt;REF NAME=RESSLER/&gt;

On October 13, 1972, Mullin beat Lawrence "Whitey" White, a [[homeless]] man, to death with a baseball bat.  White, 55, had been hitchhiking on Highway 9 and Mullin struck him down after tricking him into looking at the car engine.&lt;REF NAME=RESSLER/&gt;  Mullin was to claim later that the victim was [[Jonah]] from the [[Bible]], and that he had sent Mullin a [[telepathy|telepathic]] message saying, "Pick me up and throw me over the boat. Kill me so that others will be saved."&lt;ref name="trutv" /&gt;{{rp|4}} White's body was found the next day.&lt;REF NAME=RESSLER/&gt;

The next victim was Mary Guilfoyle, 24, a [[Cabrillo College]] student who was running late for an interview and decided to hitchhike. It was October 24, 1972. Mullin picked her up and stabbed her through the chest and the back.  He then dissected her body and scattered her remains alongside a hillside road.

On November 2, Mullin went to confess his sins at St. Mary's Catholic Church in [[Los Gatos]]. In a delusional state, he believed the priest, Father Henri Tomei (a [[French Resistance]] veteran from [[Marseilles]] who came to America after the war and was in his eighth year as assistant pastor), wanted to volunteer to be his next sacrifice to keep away the earthquakes. He beat, kicked and stabbed Tomei, who bled to death in the confessional while a parishioner watched Mullin run away. The witness description of a tall young man in dark clothing and black boots did not help the police, who initially speculated Tomei was lured into the church or startled a burglar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=19721104&amp;id=mGczAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TzIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7154,364924 "Priest in Los Gatos stabbed to death in church confessional", by UPI]&lt;/ref&gt;

After that, Mullin decided to join the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]], and passed the physical and psychiatric tests. However, he was refused entry when it was found out that he had a number of minor arrests for his bizarre and disruptive behavior in the past. This rejection fueled Mullin's paranoid delusions of conspiracies, behind which he believed was a powerful group of [[hippie]]s.

By January 1973, Mullin had stopped using drugs, and blamed them for his problems.&lt;REF NAME=RESSLER/&gt; Mullin had purchased several guns and decided to kill Jim Gianera, a high school friend who had sold him marijuana. However, when Mullin went to Gianera's house on January 25, 1973, he found that his old friend had moved away. The old cabin near the Mystery Spot on Mystery Spot Road, was now occupied by Kathy Francis (an old friend of Gianera). She gave him Gianera's new address, which was on Western Drive in Santa Cruz. There, Mullin killed both Gianera and his wife with shots to the head, then stabbed their bodies repeatedly. Mullin then went back to Francis' house, where he shot and killed her and her two sons, aged 9 and 4. Because Francis' husband — who was away at the time — was a drug dealer, the five murders were thought to be motivated by [[drug trafficking]]. Prosecutors later argued that the murder of Kathy Francis eliminated Mullin's claims of [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]] because he killed her to remove a witness who could link him to the Gianera murders.  In one published account of these murders, however, an FBI profiler states that Mullin killed the Francis family first and then executed the Gianera couple.&lt;REF NAME=RESSLER/&gt;

About a month later, in early February 1973, Mullin was wandering around [[Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park]] where he encountered four teenage boys camping illegally in the park. He walked over to them, engaged in a brief conversation and claimed to be a park ranger.  He ordered them to leave because they were "polluting" the forest, but they refused.  He told them he would return the next day.  The boys, who were armed with a .22 rifle, did not take this seriously.  Mullin returned, shot them fatally, and abandoned their bodies, which were not found until the next week.&lt;REF NAME=RESSLER/&gt;

The final murder took place three days later, on February 13. Mullin was driving alone on the Santa Cruz westside when he drove past Fred Perez, a retired fisherman, who was weeding his lawn at his home on Gharkey Street. For no apparent reason, Mullin made a U-turn, stopped his station wagon, and laid his rifle across the hood to aim, killing the man instantly. Then he got back into his car and "calmly" drove off. It was broad daylight and there were a number of witnesses, one of whom gave police the license plate number. A "docile" Mullin was captured a few minutes later at the intersection of Highway 9 and Coral Street.

== Trial and imprisonment ==
In custody, Mullin confessed to his crimes, and said that he had been told by voices in his head to kill people in order to prevent an earthquake. He claimed that the reason there had not been an earthquake recently was, in fact, due to his handiwork.

The Santa Cruz County District Attorney's office charged Mullin with ten murders, and his trial opened on July 30, 1973. Mullin had admitted to all the crimes and therefore the trial focused on whether he was [[sanity|sane]] and [[culpability|culpable]] for his actions. The fact that he had covered his tracks and shown [[premeditation]] in some of his crimes was highlighted by prosecutor [[Christopher Cottle]], while the defense argued that Mullin had a history of [[mental illness]], and that he had [[Paranoia|paranoid]] [[schizophrenia]]. On August 19, 1973, the verdict was delivered. Mullin was declared guilty of [[first-degree murder]] in the cases of Jim Gianera and Kathy Francis—because they were premeditated—while for the other eight murders Mullin was found guilty of [[second-degree murder]] because they were more impulsive.

The Santa Clara County District Attorney's office charged Mullin for the murder of Henri Tomei. On December 11, 1973, the day his trial was to begin, he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder after originally pleading [[insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]] to first-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sWRcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1VYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5367,1519486&amp;dq=herbert+mullin&amp;hl=en|title=Plea Change By Mullin|author=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Merced Sun-Star]]|date=December 12, 1973|page=18|location= Merced, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] in the Santa Cruz County trial and has been denied parole ten times since 1980. He is incarcerated at [[Mule Creek State Prison]], in [[Ione, California]].

'''Hugo Schmeisser''' (24 September 1884 – 12 September 1953) was a [[Germany|German]] developer of 20th century infantry weapons.

Schmeisser was born in [[Jena]], [[Thuringia]]. His father, [[Louis Schmeisser]] (1848–1917), was one of the best-known weapons designers in Europe. The life and work of Hugo Schmeisser mostly took place in the weapons manufacturing city of [[Suhl]], Thuringia.

== Before and during World War I ==

The [[submachine gun]]s of [[Theodor Bergmann]] are closely connected with its name recognition and weapons production in the time leading up to the [[World War I|First World War]]. Schmeisser also received his fundamental training in weapons technology at Bergmann, where 7.63&amp;nbsp;mm and 9&amp;nbsp;mm machine gun rounds were being researched. He remained in Suhl during World War I because of the crucial importance of his expertise in machine gun technology.&lt;ref name="Willbanks2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Willbanks|first=James H.|title=Machine Guns: An Illustrated History of Their Impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWkYoAkoMHIC&amp;pg=PA81|date=1 January 2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-480-6|pages=79–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Before and during World War II ==

Manufacturing regulations in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (June 28, 1919) forbade Germany from developing heavy machine guns, but permitted machine pistols or submachine guns as a suitable weapon for police. This signaled the end of a 30-year cooperation between the Schmeissers and Bergmann as production was licensed to foreign weapons manufacturers. Schmeisser decided to continue work in weapons development. Together with his brother [[Hans Schmeisser]], he created the '' "Industriewerk Auhammer Koch und Co" '' (Industrial Auhammer Koch and Company) in Suhl.&lt;ref name="McNab2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=McNab|first=Chris|title=German Automatic Rifles 1941-45: Gew 41, Gew 43, FG 42 and StG 44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qU2kAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13|date=20 March 2013|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-78096-385-3|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being at the end of World War I, he saw little business, and encumbered by the Treaty of Versailles, the future of the company was unclear. Schmeisser defied the treaty, working to continue development of automatic weapons. It was at this time that the company began cooperating with: C. G. Haenel Waffen- u. Fahrradfabrik Suhl (page in German at German WIKI), beginning a 20-year partnership. For the safety of his [[patent]]s, Schmeisser created a second company under the name of "Brothers Schmeisser" in the summer of 1922. This shrewd tactic was to prevent the loss of his patents if Auhammer went [[bankrupt]]. In order to prevent bankruptcy on both sides, Auhammer and Haenel merged, with Haenel taking full responsibility and [[legal liability|liability]] for Auhammer business affairs. Schmeisser's attorneys who settled the deal became active [[shareholder]]s in the company. Before long, it was obvious that development of many types of automatic weapons was unaffected or even accelerated by the Treaty of Versailles. In 1928 Schmeisser released the [[MP 18#Evolution|MP-28]], which was used extensively by the German police. Bayard signed an agreement with Schmeisser to manufacture and sell weapons to South Africa, China, Spain, and Japan. It is notable that these same weapons were used during the Spanish Civil War only 10 years later. Despite Schmeisser's success, the company often came within inches of bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="Willbanks2004"/&gt;

As the Nazis [[Machtergreifung|rose to power during 1933]], ten weapons development enterprises in Suhl and [[Zella-Mehlis]] merged under the name of "United Suhl-Zella Mehlis Armament Makers". This central administration was used to coordinate production with the army's needs. This allowed Schmeisser to make a very important  business acquaintance, which later developed to a friendship, with the aviator [[Ernst Udet]], a deputy of [[Hermann Göring]] under Germany's ''[[Luftwaffe]]''. Schmeisser had a direct role in military production decisions, often influencing the decisions of [[Adolf Hitler]] and Göring. After 1935 Haenel experienced an enormous upswing in weapon production. Against the desires of many engineers and technical designers, the Schmeisser brothers continued to enforce patent royalties and manage company funds.&lt;ref name="MusgraveNelson1967"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Musgrave|first1=Daniel D.|last2=Nelson|first2=Thomas B.|title=The World's Assault Rifles and Automatic Carbines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q5pBAAAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=T. B. N. Enterprises|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berthold Geipel of ErMa designed the MP 36 using Vollmer's EMP. The chief designer, [[Heinrich Vollmer]], revised the basic construction of ErMa [[MP-36]] and developed from it the well-known German submachine guns of the Second World War, the [[MP-38]] and the [[MP-40]]. 1.2 million pieces were manufactured for these weapons, and were among the first weapons to be manufactured with die cast parts, metal stamping, and a complete machine-assembly. This method revolutionized weapon production, allowing manufacture at an unprecedented speed. They became internationally known as "Schmeisser MP"s, mainly due to the use of the straight magazine he had patented.&lt;ref name="Peterson2013"/&gt;

Schmeisser's most important work had been underway since 1938. This new automatic weapon, with a short cartridge 7.92&amp;nbsp;mm, allowed for smart usage of resources and high production. At first named the Mkb 42, it later received the designation of [[MP-43]], and it became one of the first [[assault rifle]]s. By 1943, 10,000 pieces had already been manufactured for the front. For a short time, Hitler stopped production, as he was mysteriously opposed to the new weapon. In 1944, after troop testing verified the new weapon's legitimacy, Hitler authorized mass production of the MP-43 as well as further research into a new MP-44. In April 1944 the new weapon received the designation of ''"Sturmgewehr 44"'' ("Assault Rifle 44"). The [[StG 44]] was arguably Schmeisser's most important weapon development.&lt;ref name="Peterson2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Phillip|title=Standard Catalog of Military Firearms: The Collector's Price and Reference Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWYFAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152|date=18 October 2013|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-3692-1|pages=152–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== After World War II ==
Schmeisser was one of 16 Germans for which a special department (no. 58) was created at factory number 74, later known as [[Izmash]]. Schmeisser was appointed as one of the five designers of the group, together with Kurt Horn and [[Werner Gruner]] (both from [[Grossfuss]]) and Oscar Schink (from [[Gustloff]]), under the formal leadership of Karl Barnitzke (also from Gustloff). There is some evidence that Schmeisser was uncooperative with the Soviets because he received the most negative review by his Soviet handlers in this group of five German designers. In these Soviet reviews, Schmeisser was described as a "practical man", whose lack of formal training showed whenever he was presented with any design problems.

Schmeisser worked in Izhevsk until 1952 when he and other German specialists returned home to Germany. With short notice, his stay in the Soviet Union was extended beyond that of the other weapon specialists by a half year. He finally returned home on 9 June 1952. Schmeisser died on 12 September 1953, and was buried in Suhl. The 50th anniversary of his death was honored by a ceremony held in Suhl, as he is recognized as one of the most important technical designers of infantry weapons of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="HoggWalter2004"/&gt;

'''John Belcher''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1721-1763) was a Welsh [[Methodist]] preacher. His father, Edmund Belcher, of [[Eglwys Ilan]], was a local smith, and John himself initially joined him in the trade. By 1743 however he was working with the Watford Association. In 1744 he became an assistant of [[Howel Harris]]. He then was directed to tour North Wales. He enlisted in the army in 1758. His date of death is uncertain, but believed to be sometime after 1763.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Belcher|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-BELC-JOH-1721.html|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kimi and Ritz''' were a short-lived English pop vocal duo in the early 1970s, comprising [[Richard O'Brien]] (best known as the creator of cult stage musical ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'') and his then wife, Kimi Wong O'Brien.  Although the duo only recorded six songs (of which two were never even released), they have since acquired something of a cult reputation in the light of O'Brien's subsequent success as a performer and songwriter.

==Background==
In 1971, Richard O'Brien and his girlfriend Kimi Wong were struggling actors, performing in the English touring production of the stage musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.  During this time they befriended fellow cast member John Sinclair and, through him, John's childhood friend Andrew (Andy) Leighton, a budding record engineer.&lt;ref name="andy"&gt;"Andrew O'Bonzo: A Talk with Richard O'Brien's music publisher, Andy Leighton", ''Crazed Imaginations'', No 57 (May 2000), pp 12–15&lt;/ref&gt;  When Sinclair left ''Hair'' after a knee injury and, he and Leighton attempted to establish their own recording studio, and then co-founded a music publishing company, Druidcrest Music.  By this time, Richard O'Brien had left the cast of ''Hair'' to join the original London production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', although he soon left when the management disagreed over his interpretation of Herod.  He and Kimi were married on 4 December 1971.&lt;ref name="kimi"&gt;Interview with Kimi Wong O'Brien, in Scott Michaels and David Evans, ''Rocky Horror: From Concept to Cult'', London: Sanctuary Publishing, 2002, pp 43–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the birth of their son the following April, Kimi re-joined the cast of ''Hair'' (playing the featured role of Chrissie) while O'Brien stayed home and looked after their son while working on the script that would eventually become ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]''.&lt;ref name="andy"/&gt; During that time, John Sinclair and Andy Leighton were frequent visitors to O'Brien's flat and, after initially signing him to their publishing company, subsequently made him a full partner in it.&lt;ref name="andy"/&gt; The three men duly adopted the pseudonym of Andrew O'Bonzo to describe themselves, and launched a music production company, Rich Teaboy Productions.

==The Singles==
===Merry Christmas Baby/Eddie===
At a time when it was still common for pop performers to approach record companies to obtain a one-off contract to release a single on their label, Andrew O'Bonzo struck up a deal with [[Epic Records]] (a division of CBS Records) for Richard O'Brien and his wife Kimi to release two songs that he had written.  Produced under the auspices of Rich Teaboy Productions, the songs were arranged by London musician [[Robin Sylvester]], later to become a prominent session guitarist and (since 2003) bass player for [[Ratdog]].  The single, released on 7 December 1973, comprised an original [[Christmas song]], "Merry Christmas Baby" (sung by Kimi, with some harmonies and a spoken interlude by O'Brien) and, on the B side, Kimi's rendition of "[[Eddie (Rocky Horror song)|Eddie]]" (aka "Eddie's Teddy"), one of the songs written for ''The Rocky Horror Show''.  The latter song, released the same year as the show's original London cast album, can rightly be considered as the first of innumerable [[cover version]]s of songs from the cult show.

Along with general release, copies of the debut single were also sold from the foyer of the King's Road Theatre in Chelsea, where ''The Rocky Horror Show'' was being performed at the time, and were later given away to crew members when work was completed on the show's 1975 film adaptation, ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]''.&lt;ref name="kimi"/&gt; According to Kimi Wong, the single sold about 12,000 copies and not only got onto the BBC radio playlist but also scored a complimentary review from [[John Peel]], a leading DJ of the day.&lt;ref name="kimi"/&gt; In an effort to generate further Christmas airplay,the single was re-issued around the same time the following year, on 22 November 1974.

===I was in Love with Danny/Pseud's Corner===
During 1974, Rich Teaboy Productions secured a second one-off single deal from Epic Records.&lt;ref name="andy"/&gt; This time, the A-side was an original O'Brien composition with the lengthy title of "I was in love with Danny (but the crowd was in love with Dean)".  Essentially a new take on the traditional [[teenage tragedy song]], the song was performed as a duet and told the story of two competing race car drivers, one of whom was killed during the race.  The B-side was "Pseud's Corner", named after a weekly column in the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'', which featured a solo vocal by O'Brien and some complex [[word play]] in its dark and obscure lyrics.  This time around, the songs were arranged by O'Brien's friend [[Richard Hartley]], former keyboardist for [[The Tornados]], who had also served as arranger and musical director for the original stage production of ''The Rocky Horror Show''. The new single was released on 21 February 1975, but generated little attention or airplay.

===Liebesträume/There's A Light===
Rich Teaboy Productions subsequently recorded another two songs by Kimi &amp; Ritz for possible release; however, this time CBS Records did not take up the option.  The proposed A-side was an updated version of the "[[Liebesträume]]" by [[Franz Liszt]], with new lyrics by O'Brien.&lt;ref name="andy"/&gt; The B-side was to be another selection from ''The Rocky Horror Show'' score – a version of "There's a Light" (aka "[[Over at the Frankenstein Place]]"), albeit re-arranged for a string section and a vocal chorus that included Kimi Wong, Richard O'Brien, [[Belinda Sinclair]] and perhaps even John Sinclair and Andy Leighton themselves.&lt;ref name="andy"/&gt;

==Legacy==
During this period, Rich Teaboy Productions oversaw the recording and release of one-off singles credited to other artists including  ''Truth &amp; Beauty'' (1974), ''Dicky Hart and the Palpitations'' (1975) and [[Belinda Sinclair]] (with ''The Richard O'Brien Crusade'') (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockymusic.org/tags/Andrew+O%27Bonzo.php|title=Rocky Music: The Musical World of Rocky Horror – Andrew O'Bonzo|accessdate=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although O'Brien himself was involved in these projects in various capacities (as a writer, co-writer and/or vocalist), he and his wife never again recorded under the name Kimi &amp; Ritz.  Kimi Wong appeared in ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), and in O'Brien's follow-up stage musical, ''[[T Zee]]'' (1976) before the couple divorced in 1979.&lt;ref name="kimi"/&gt;

Since 1975, the three Kimi &amp; Ritz singles have never been commercially re-issued in any format, although they were later included on a limited edition bootleg CD entitled '' Dark Refrains'' (1996), which consisted of rare ''Rocky Horror''-related audio tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanityfortoday.com/darkrefrains.html |title=Dark Refrains: A Collection Of Rocky Horror And Related Rarities |accessdate=20 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615000510/http://sanityfortoday.com/darkrefrains.html |archivedate=15 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the original 7-inch vinyl releases, and the bootleg CD (of which only 35 copies were pressed) remain extremely rare and sought-after collector's items, particularly amongst fans of ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]''.  In more recent years, the tracks (except for the still-unreleased "[[Liebesträume]]" and "[[There's a Light]]" recordings) have circulated as internet downloads from various websites.

* [[Karl Benz]]: industrialist. Father and inventor of the gasoline-powered automobile, 1885, and pioneering founder of automobile manufacturing.
* [[Albrecht Berblinger]]: engineer. Inventor of the spring prosthesis and hang-glider (1811).&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Albrecht Ludwig Berblinger (1770-1829), known as the "Flying Tailor of Ulm", started with flight experiments in Ulm, Germany, in the early 19th century. He gained experience in downhill gliding with a maneuverable airworthy semi-rigid hang-glider and then attempted to cross the Danube River at Ulm's Eagle's Bastion on 31 May 1811. The tricky local winds caused him to crash and he was rescued by fishermen, making him the first survivor of a water immersion accident of a heavier-than-air manned "flight machine". Though he failed in his attempt to be the first man to fly, Berblinger can be regarded as one of the significant aviation pioneers who applied the "heavier than air" principle and paved the way for the more effective glide-flights of Otto Lilienthal (1891) and the Wright Brothers (1902). Less known are Berblinger's significant contributions to the construction of artificial limbs for medical use, as well as the spring-application in aviation.

'''Lynette "Lynn" Gilderdale''' (20 September 1977 – 4 December 2008), also known on the internet as '''Jessie Oliver''',&lt;ref name="guardian_250110"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jan/25/lynn-gilderdale-me-assisted-suicide|title='Trapped by ME, Lynn Gilderdale made it clear she wanted to die | first = S | last = Laville | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 2010-01-25 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United Kingdom|British]] woman with a severely diminished quality of life from [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] (referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis in the United Kingdom) who died by suicide after taking a [[morphine]] overdose after she decided she no longer wanted to endure the pain from the illness.  She was assisted by her mother, '''Bridget Kathleen "Kay" Gilderdale''', who was subsequently charged with attempted murder and was eventually given a one-year [[conditional discharge]] after admitting to assisting with her daughter's suicide.

==Early life==

She spent her early life in [[Burwash]], [[East Sussex]] in south-eastern [[England]].  She later moved with her family to nearby Stonegate where she attended school.&lt;ref name="Times Online 08 December 2008"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article5306389.ece|title=Woman arrested over 'murder' of sick daughter | location=London | work=The Times|first=Philippe|last=Naughton|date=8 December 2008}}, Philippe Naughton, Times Online, 8 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  She participated in sailing and other sports, was captain of her school netball team, and won prizes for ballet.

Her father, Richard Gilderdale, was a police officer in East Sussex and has been latterly employed in a civilian role for the force.  Her mother was an auxiliary nurse, then an accountant, but from 1992 was Lynn's full-time carer.

==Onset of illness==

Gilderdale fell ill in November 1991 after receiving the [[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin|BCG]] vaccination.  She attended school for only one or two days following this. She had a series of infections including flu, bronchitis, tonsillitis and glandular fever.  The illness progressed rapidly, and from accounts by her mother, within six months "she was totally bedridden, unable to lift her head off the pillow, or care for herself in any way at all.  She was tube-fed, her legs were paralysed and she couldn’t sit up.  She was unable to speak, read or write and her memory had gone".&lt;ref name="kay_25pc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.25megroup.org/info_me_stories.html#lynnstory|title=Kay Gilderdale's account of Lynn's illness, 25% ME Group website}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At her worst, she was paralysed in all but her little finger, and suffered muscle spasms and severe light and sound sensitivity.&lt;ref name="argus_endlesslove"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/819443.Mother___s_endless_love_for_daughter__who_has_lain_ill_for_14_years/|title=Mother’s endless love for daughter, who has lain ill for 14 years}} by Claire Truscott, The Argus, 5 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by mid-1993, Lynn was able to move her arms again, as she was shown doing in a documentary on ME.

Lynn Gilderdale reported in 2008 that she had been sexually abused in a hospital at the age of 14; the police investigated, but made no arrests.&lt;ref name="herald_abuse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/crime-courts/mother-who-helped-sick-daughter-die-walks-free-1.1001494|title=Mother who helped sick daughter die walks free}} by George Arbuthnott, Herald Scotland website, 26 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media appearances==

Lynn Gilderdale appeared in the media on various occasions during her illness, and features without being named in various printed literature on CFS, such as the book "The New Plague" by Jane Colby (First and Best in Education, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisissussex.co.uk/news/campaigners-offer-condolences-Lynn-s-family/article-540036-detail/article.html|title=ME campaigners offer condolences to Lynn's family, This is Sussex, December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared by name on three occasions:

* In 1993, she was filmed for the Channel 4 documentary, Frontline, presented by Dr Anne Macintyre.  She was shown lying in her bed with a [[Nasogastric intubation|nasogastric tube]] visible, using very basic gestures to communicate.  Macintyre described her as "imprisoned by paralysis, mental confusion and pain" but did not discuss her specific symptoms, other than memory loss and lack of ability to swallow, in detail.
* In 2001, the BBC published an interview with Kay Gilderdale with photos of Lynn.  Lynn's complications, such as hypothalmic dysfunction and a blood clot on the lung, were mentioned in more detail than in 1993.&lt;ref name="bbc2001"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1234297.stm|title='ME has taken over my daughter's life', BBC News, Mar 21, 2001 | date=21 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kay was interviewed again in 2004 by "The Courier", which may have been the Kent and Sussex Courier.&lt;ref name="courier2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.25megroup.org/Newsletter/Issue%2017/Media%20Stories%2017.htm|title=Lynn’s Lust for Life Fuels Fight for Recovery and Research}}, by James Pennink, The Courier, 14 May 2004, extract on 25% ME Group website&lt;/ref&gt;  An extract is available on the 25% ME Group website and it does not mention the name Gilderdale but does mention Lynn and Kay and the quote - "Lynn finished by saying, that she will keep fighting to get better and that she did not live through the last 12 years not to get well and live a proper life" - is consistent with sentiments expressed in the 2001 BBC article.

Kay Gilderdale wrote a book, ''One Last Goodbye'', which was published in the UK in April 2011. She also appeared in an independently-produced documentary, ''Voices from the Shadows'', about severe ME and the mistreatment of British patients, which premiered at the [[Mill Valley Film Festival]] in 2011 and won the Audience Favorite International Documentary Award there, and was recently released on mail-order DVD in Europe.

==Later period of illness==

Gilderdale remained bedridden, unable to speak or swallow, in constant pain and suffering other debilitating symptoms for the whole of the period from mid-1992 to her death in December 2008.  She required, by her mother's reckoning, between 50 and 60 hospital admissions.  On one such occasion in late 2005, her lung was punctured during an operation at Conquest Hospital, [[Hastings]], to replace a [[Hickman line]], resulting in her ending up on life support. Her mother reported that she also suffered broken bones due to [[osteoporosis]].  At the time, her parents "said their goodbyes" as they feared she would not survive.  She did survive, but Lynn found the experience traumatic and she subsequently expressed the wish not to be resuscitated in case of future similar circumstances.&lt;ref name="mea_trialday1_2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meassociation.org.uk/?p=811|title='Kay Gilderdale trial: prosecution opens'}}, from the Brighton Evening Argus, 18 January 2010, reproduced on the ME Association website&lt;/ref&gt;

However, her paralysis partly receded, the family were able to take care of her medical needs at home and reduce her hospital admissions to two or three per year, and her memory improved, enabling her to re-learn to read and to type. She used a pocket computer to communicate with friends over the Internet.&lt;ref name="kay_25pc" /&gt;

==Death==

According to Kay Gilderdale:

:"Although every system in Lynn’s body was badly affected, for a long time she truly believed she would recover, but gradually, as a result of chronic illness, more and more conditions were added to the already lengthy list [hypothalamic dysfunction, liver dysfunction, adrenal failure, [[angina]], [[renal tubular acidosis]] type 1, [[osteoporosis]], to name but a few ] and she started to say to me in her sign language, ‘Mum, you can’t fix me any more – I’m too broken, I’ve had enough’."&lt;ref name="kay_25pc" /&gt;

Lynn attempted suicide in May 2007&lt;ref name="panorama2010"&gt;BBC Panorama documentary [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qs930 "I Helped My Daughter Die"], broadcast 1 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt; with an overdose of morphine and an injection of air.  After this failure, she later wrote, she never wavered in her desire to die.  She posted an explanation towards the end of her life, explaining that she was "so very, very tired" and that her spirit was broken (see below).&lt;ref name="dnr2008"&gt;L. Gilderdale, "Do Not Resuscitate". Differently edited versions were printed in the [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/7073330/Kay-Gilderdale-case-the-diary-of-Lynn-Gilderdales-last-months.html Daily Telegraph], [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article7002306.ece The Times] and the [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1246053/Lynn-Gilderdales-heartbreaking-online-diary-chronicled-life-suffered-ME.html Daily Mail]; an extract from the article as written by Lynn is included in [http://www.25megroup.org/info_me_stories.html Kay Gilderdale's account] of her daughter's illness.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynn died at 0710 on 4 December 2008. Kay's prosecution for attempted murder hinged on her actions during those hours, as she gave the family doctor the impression that she had injected Lynn with air, to cause a fatal [[embolism]] and with the [[antidepressant]] [[Sertraline]]. However, Lynn's body revealed no trace of the latter and Kay later said she could not remember injecting Lynn with air.&lt;ref name="panorama2010" /&gt;

==Prosecution of Kay Gilderdale==

Kay was charged with attempted murder on 21 April 2009.&lt;ref name="kgcharged_2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/8010011.stm|title='ME death mother appears in court | work=BBC News | date=21 April 2009}}, BBC News website, 21 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  

The trial itself began on 12 January 2010.&lt;ref name="bbc_kgtrial_start_2010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/8454280.stm|title='Sussex mother on trial over daughter's ME death' | work=BBC News | date=12 January 2010}}, BBC News website, 12 Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The prosecution opened their case on 18 January, making the accusation of deliberate injections of air.&lt;ref name="mea_trialday1_2010" /&gt;  Prosecution Sally Howes QC told the jury:

:"It is the prosecution’s case that when Mrs Gilderdale realised that the two large doses of morphine that she provided to Lynn, that Lynn self-administered to try to end her life…instead of then realising that her daughter’s suicide had gone horribly wrong, she then set about, over the next 30 hours, in performing actions which were designed with no other intention other than terminating her daughter’s life."

:The further morphine, the further cocktail of drugs, the injecting of air – all designed to terminate her daughter's life. It wasn't done to make her better, it was done to make sure she died.&lt;ref name="mea_trialday1_2010" /&gt;

On 19 January, Lynn Gilderdale's father, Richard, who had been divorced from Kay but was still involved in Lynn's care, testified in Kay's defence.  He testified that Lynn had developed a fear of hospitals after a series of incidents including the Oct 2005 Hickman line incident and had been sexually abused by a senior health professional in London.  With regard to her quality of life, he replied, "It was less than poor. She had no quality of life. She couldn’t eat, she couldn’t drink." Richard Gilderdale, and Julie Cheeseman another of Lynn Gilderdale's carers, related that they had both tried to dissuade her from taking her own life.&lt;ref name="mea_trialday2_2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meassociation.org.uk/?p=812|title='Kay Gilderdale trial: second day'}}, Brighton Evening Argus, 19 January; reproduced on the ME Association website&lt;/ref&gt; On the third day, the prosecution told the jury that Kay had searched the Internet for various suicide-related phrases in between Lynn's overdose and her death.&lt;ref name="mea_trialday3_2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meassociation.org.uk/?p=813|title='Kay Gilderdale trial: third day'}}, Brighton Evening Argus, 20 January; reproduced on the ME Association website&lt;/ref&gt;  Closing speeches were given by defence and prosecution on 23 January&lt;ref name="mea_trialclose_2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meassociation.org.uk/?p=817|title='Kay Gilderdale trial: closing speeches'}}, from the Daily Telegraph, 23 Jan 2010, reproduced on the ME Association website&lt;/ref&gt; and Kay was acquitted of the attempted murder charge on 25 Jan.&lt;ref name="mea_kgacquittal_2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meassociation.org.uk/?p=821|title='Kay Gilderdale cleared of attempting to murder daughter with ME'}}, The Times, 25 Jan 2010, reproduced on the ME Association website&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Kay Gilderdale's acquittal, the judge made a statement praising the jury. Mr Justice Bean remarked: "I do not normally comment on the verdicts of juries but in this case their decision, if I may say so, shows that common sense, decency and humanity which makes jury trials so important in a case of this kind."&lt;ref name="telegraph_260110"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7077426/Why-was-Kay-Gilderdale-in-court-charged-with-attempted-murder.html|title='Why was Kay Gilderdale in court charged with attempted murder?' | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Caroline|last=Gammell|date=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Máximo Laura Taboada''' (born 1959 in [[Ayacucho]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maximolaura.com/about-maximo-laura/|title=About Laura|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Máximo Laura|access-date=|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an award-winning tapestry weaver internationally recognized as one of South America´s pre-eminent and most unique textile artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofthreadsfestival.com/artist_interviews/083_maximo_laura_12.html|title=-Weekly Fibre Artist Interview|date=August 24, 2012|author=Adminprensa|publisher=Worldofthreadsfestival.com|accessdate=2012-11-30}} (English)&lt;/ref&gt; Laura is known for his tapestries that intertwine Peruvian tradition with contemporary aesthetics, and for creating the contemporary tapestry movement that is seen today in Peru, promoting Peruvian textiles around the world with 160 exhibits, in more than 40 countries.

Laura is the fifth generation of weavers that learned his craft as a child at the side of his father while growing up in Ayacucho; he learned his art by never silencing the internal self-exploration or the external exploration of the world, including a lifelong study of art history and literature beyond the borders of Peru. While he now lives and works in Lima, his work is deeply imbued with the legends and storytelling of his Peruvian heritage and with his own very compelling life experiences. Laura draws from many sources of inspiration, such as Chavin culture which is expressive and totemic; Paracas which is colorful and strong; Nazca and Huari for their geometric forms; and Chancay for its sobriety and linear spirit.

Maximo Laura is co-founder of Iberoamerican Textile Network and the Peruvian Center of Textile Art. He is also member of the American Tapestry Alliance, the European Tapestry Network and the British Tapestry Group.

In 2010 Laura won the Award of "National Living Human Treasure" of Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bn.com.pe/noticias/2011/14-enero-2011-BN-premio-tesoros-humanos-viviente-de-la-nacion.html|title=Banco de la Nación premió a "Tesoros Humanos Vivientes de la Nación 2010"|date=January 14, 2011|publisher=Banco de la Nación|accessdate=2012-11-30}} (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Laura opened the Museo Maximo Laura in Cusco, Peru, which houses the largest collection of Maximo Laura's award-winning masterpieces that can be seen in one place, anywhere in the world.

'''Otto Fetting'''  (November 20, 1871 – January 30, 1933) was an American [[realtor]] and [[editor]] from [[Port Huron, Michigan]] who served first as a [[pastor]] and [[Evangelist (Latter Day Saints)|evangelist]] in the [[Community of Christ|Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], and then later as an [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] in the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]], commonly referred to as the "Hedrickites". Fetting claimed to have been visited by [[John the Baptist]] thirty or more times between February 4, 1927 and his death on January 30, 1933. Fetting was reportedly given instruction concerning the doctrine and practices of Hedrickites and other factions of [[Christianity]], together with directives to begin construction of a [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple]] on the [[Temple Lot]], including its exact dimensions. 

After initially accepting his first eleven revelations, a Hedrickite conference vote in early October 1929 rejected a key portion of Fetting's [http://www.elijahmessage.net/files/message12.html twelfth message], leading him to found the [[Church of Christ (Fettingite)|"Church of Jesus Christ"]] on April 8, 1930. This breakaway faction, later referred to as "Church of Christ", subsequently gave birth to additional rival factions after Fetting's death, which have still further subdivided.  These "Fettingite" or "Dravesite" (named after [[W.A. Draves]], a follower of Fetting) factions include: the [[Church of Christ with the Elijah Message|Church of Christ "With the Elijah Message" Established Anew 1929]]; the [[Church of Christ (Restored)]]; the [[Church of Christ (Assured Way)]]; [http://www.elijahmessage.com "The Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, Established in 1929 Anew], [http://www.elijahmessage.net The Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, Inc.] and the [[Church of Christ at Halley's Bluff]]. 

==Otto Fetting and the Hedrickites==
Otto Fetting was born in [[Casco Township, St. Clair County, Michigan|Casco, Michigan]]. Eventually making his home in nearby Port Huron, Michigan, he was baptised into the [[Community of Christ|Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] on February 9, 1891, and ordained to its [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] in 1899.  In 1925, dismayed by the "[[Supreme Directional Control]]" controversy within the RLDS church, Fetting switched his allegiance to the Temple Lot organization.  At the time, this did not require rebaptism or reordination, as each group accepted the priesthood and [[sacraments]] of the other.  In the spring of 1926, he was among seven men ordained to be Apostles in the Church of Christ.

==Visitation by John the Baptist==
[[Image:Otto Fetting April 6 1929.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Otto Fetting on April 6, 1929 praying at a [[groundbreaking]] ceremony for a proposed [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|Temple]].]] 
On February 4, 1927, Otto Fetting claimed that he had been visited by John the Baptist, who delivered a message for him to give to the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)|Hedrickite]] organization.  This message commanded construction of the long-awaited Temple in [[Independence, Missouri]], first foretold by Latter Day Saint founder [[Joseph Smith]] in 1831.  The Temple Lot church had a long history of direction via revelation and angel visits, and thus was originally receptive to these alleged visits of the Biblical prophet, publishing Fetting's messages in their monthly periodical ''Zion's Advocate''. They also began work on the temple with a groundbreaking ceremony held on April 6, 1929.  According to Fetting, the Hedrickites were given seven years to complete the structure.

Fetting's "visitor" revealed various architectural details for the building, and specifically directed surveyors to move their markers ten feet to the east of where they had originally been placed.  The angel also revealed the location of two of Joseph Smith's original marker stones, which Smith had buried ninety-eight years before to indicate the location for his planned temple.  He also indicated that the "Articles of Faith and Practice" of the Temple Lot church were correct, and should not be changed from their original form.  On other occasions, the messenger indicated particular men to be ordained within the organization, including to its Quorum of Twelve Apostles.

==The twelfth message==
Although the Temple Lot organization had enthusiastically accepted the first eleven of Fetting's messages, this would not hold true for the twelfth.  In verse four of this missive, John the Baptist states that all persons coming into the Church of Christ must be rebaptized, as "the Lord has rejected all creeds and factions of men".  While this reflects the practice of the majority of Latter Day Saint denominations (including the Temple Lot church itself, today), it did not reflect the policy of the Temple Lot church at the time, which accepted members during this period from the Reorganized church, certain other Latter Day Saint organizations, and Joseph Smith's pre-1844 church on their original baptisms.  This message equally declared Fetting to have been given the same "[[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)#Priesthood keys|keys to the priesthood]]" that were given to [[Joseph Smith]] and [[Oliver Cowdery]] on May 15, 1829. 

Controversy over the meaning and application of Fetting's twelfth message became so great that Fetting himself was "silenced" in October 1929 by the Temple Lot organization.  Choosing to withdraw rather than continue under such a restriction, Fetting led approximately half of the Church of Christ members (including some of its apostles) to found an organization of his own, which became known as the Church of Christ (Fettingite).  Since the main Temple Lot organization retained possession of the Temple Lot and its meetinghouse, Fetting's organization met in members' homes for a considerable period prior to building their own worship facilities.  

==Death and testimonial==
Fetting would be visited a total of 30 times by his "messenger" prior to his death on January 30, 1933.  To the end of his life, Fetting insisted upon the veracity of his heavenly visitor, and the truth of the messages he was given.  He authored the following testimony in 1929:

:TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

:I make this solemn declaration before God this day, God being my witness, and I expect some day to stand before the judgement bar to answer for this statement.

:The manifestation and words of the visits of the Messenger are true. I have seen him from time to time. I heard his voice, I've seen his face, I saw the light, I felt his hand on my head and the slap on my shoulder. I was enwrapt in that wonderful Heavenly and Divine power, and the words I have given you are not my words, but the words God sent by John the Baptist.

:I want to make this statement, so that everyone may know that this is true; it matters little what will become of me hereafter, but I cannot, nor will not, deny the things I have seen and heard from the Heavenly Messenger as long as I have my right mind, and God gives me life and His grace to endure here on Earth.

:Others may make statements about me, but I want this to be understood that this statement is true. And I shall abide by the advice and instructions given by the Messenger regardless of what men may say.

:Signed Otto Fetting

:Independence, Missouri, October 9, 1929

Four other people claimed to have seen John the Baptist during his final visit to Fetting, and their testimony was notarized.

==Division of the Fettingite organization==
Four years after Fetting's death, a young Fettingite [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|Elder]] named [[W.A. Draves|William A. Draves]] from [[Nucla, Colorado]] claimed that the same messenger who had appeared to Fetting had begun to appear to him, as well.  While many of Fetting's followers accepted Draves and his messages, some did not, leading to a split in the Fettingite organization in 1939.  Draves' adherents formed the [[Church of Christ with the Elijah Message]], which claims to be the sole legitimate continuance of Fetting's original organization.  Draves himself would receive a total of 90 messages prior to his death in 1994, all of which were combined with Fetting's into a book entitled [[The Word of the Lord Brought to Mankind by an Angel]].

The Fettingites who rejected Draves' claims later split into two separate organizations, divided by the decision of the Church of Christ (Fettingite)—the remnant in Independence who rejected William Draves' claims—to introduce the [[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Saturday Sabbath]] into their organization during the 1950s under Apostle S.T. Bronson.  A group of congregations in [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]], under the leadership of A.C. DeWolf, rejected this change and formed the Church of Christ (Restored), which continues to observe Sunday as their day of worship.

Other than disagreeing as to the proper day for worship, the "Bronsonite" and "DeWolf" organizations remain virtually identical in doctrine and practice.  Both of them accept Fetting's ministry and messages, but not Draves'.  Each rejects the other, and considers itself the sole true continuation of Otto Fetting's church.  Draves' organization, on the other hand, rejects both of these groups, accepting their founder's messages ''and'' those of Otto Fetting.  

The [[Church of Christ at Halley's Bluff]] has no connection with any of these organizations, though it does accept Fetting's message (but not those of Draves).

'''Paul Rowley Atterbury''', [[Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]] (born 8 April 1945) is a British [[antiques]] expert, known for his many appearances since 1979 on the [[BBC]] TV programme ''[[Antiques Roadshow]].''  He specialises in the art, architecture, design and decorative arts of the 19th and 20th centuries.

==Biography==
He is the oldest son of Rowley Atterbury and puppeteer [[Audrey Atterbury]] (née Holman),&lt;ref name=goon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegoons.org/rubovia/Bios/Bio_AA.htm |title=Biography of Audrey Atterbury |publisher=Telegoons.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908181442/http://telegoons.org/rubovia/Bios/Bio_AA.htm |archivedate=8 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; who worked on the 1950s children's ''[[Watch With Mother]]'' programme ''[[Andy Pandy]]'' for the [[BBC]] and who, it is claimed, based the character's appearance on that of her son.&lt;ref name=goon/&gt; 

He was educated at [[Westminster School]] and the [[University of East Anglia]] (BA, 1972).&lt;ref&gt;'ATTERBURY, Paul Rowley', Who's Who 2014, A &amp; C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Originally training as a graphic designer, he later went on to work for [[Sotheby's|Sotheby Publications]]. He became an historical advisor for [[Royal Doulton]] and was the editor of ''Connoisseur'' magazine from 1980 to 1981.

Since 1981, Atterbury has been a [[freelance writer]], lecturer, broadcaster and exhibition curator. He most frequently curates for the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London, his exhibitions there including "[[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]]: a Gothic Passion" (1994) and "Inventing New Britain: the Victorian Vision" (2001).

Atterbury has written or edited over thirty books, mostly on [[ceramic]]s. He is also known for his travel writing, and has written books on railways and canals. He has published books of old postcards showing [[Eype]] and [[West Bay, Dorset|West Bay]], two [[Dorset]] villages.

Until 2003, Atterbury was chairman of the [[Little Angel Theatre]] puppet theatre in [[Islington]], north London.&lt;ref name=goon/&gt; He has toured the country with his stage show 'Have You Had it Long Madam?' with fellow ''Antiques Roadshow'' expert [[Hilary Kay]]; the show visited Australia in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2009/11/09/2737643.htm|title=Have you had it long, madam?|last=Winfield|first=Grady|date=9 November 2009|website=ABC Radio Perth|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Atterbury appeared on [[Channel 4]]'s [[archaeology]] series ''[[Time Team]]'', and in 2009 he narrated [[BBC Four]]'s documentary ''The Last Days of the Liners'' which examined how, in the years following [[World War II]], countries competed to launch the most magnificent passenger ships on the great ocean routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nrtj6 |title=The Last Days of the Liners |publisher=BBC Four |accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a [[Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society of Arts]]. 

Atterbury is the owner of the only remaining Teddy puppet from the television series ''[[Andy Pandy]]'', that is not kept as part of a museum collection, which was a gift to his mother.

He lives in [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] in Dorset with his second wife, Chrissie, whom he married in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ChlaP734Y9kC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=chrissie+atterbury&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VPsrDpsIVL&amp;sig=fdhxtVCaJgHnBLopozapa0Al5Vc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijh5HOk_nSAhUrDMAKHds2AuoQ6AEISzAM#v=onepage&amp;q=chrissie%20atterbury&amp;f=false Paul Atterbury and [[Hilary Kay]], ''The Wedding: 150 Years of Down-the-Aisle Style'', David &amp; Charles (2005) – [[Google Books]] pg 128]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dorsetmagazine.co.uk/people/why_paul_atterbury_from_antiques_roadshow_loves_dorset_1_1635224 Why Paul Atterbury from Antiques Roadshow loves Dorset – ''Dorset Magazine'' 20 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Russell Moore''' (born October 1958) is best known as the [[HBOS]] [[whistleblower]] following his dismissal from Halifax Bank of Scotland in 2004. Moore was the bank’s Head of Group Regulatory Risk and was fired from the role by HBOS Group Chief Executive Office James Crosby following his warnings to the Board about HBOS’s risky sales strategies.

In 2009 Moore’s evidence about HBOS was presented to the UK House of Commons Treasury Select Committee and resulted in James Crosby resigning as Deputy Chairman of the Financial Services Authority (now the Financial Conduct Authority). Crosby, who was also an adviser to the then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, later gave up his knighthood and part of his pension after a Parliamentary report was highly critical of his, HBOS Chairman Lord Dennis Stevenson and HBOS CEO Andy Hornby’s management of the bank. Since his dismissal Moore has been shunned by the financial community and has been unable to find another job in the sector. He has endured depression and alcoholism.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} He has continued to fight for change in the financial system and to bring those responsible for the 2008 crisis to justice.

In 2015 Moore wrote his memoirs in a book called [https://web.archive.org/web/20120805034419/http://www.newwilberforce.co.uk/ Crash Bank Wallop] and has launched [https://web.archive.org/web/20120805034419/http://www.newwilberforce.co.uk/ The New Wilberforce Movement] to free the world from the slavery of greed.

==Early life==
Paul Russell Moore was born in Bristol, England on 30 October 1958. He was educated at Ampleforth College in North Yorkshire and studied law at Bristol University.

==Early career==
After becoming a barrister he became the in-house lawyer in the product development department of Allied Dunbar in December 1984. He left in December 1988 to join Kleinworth Benson as its in-house lawyer but was only there until April 1989 when he was headhunted by start-up firm Ellastone. In February 1990 he moved to American Express subsidiary Acuma as General Counsel and Head of Compliance and was there until February 1994. In February 1995 Moore joined accountancy firm [[KPMG]] becoming its top-performing Partner.

==HBOS==
Moore joined HBOS in July 2002 as Head of Risk in the Insurance and Investment Division. He was appointed to the role of Head of [[Financial risk management|Group Regulatory Risk]] at the end of 2003. He had formal responsibility for the bank's policy and oversight of executive management's compliance with [[Financial Services Authority|FSA]] regulation.  It was during 2004 whilst conducting reviews of the bank’s sales culture and selling practices that Moore and his team uncovered mis-selling and other unfair customer sales tactics. However, when Moore reported these findings, as his job demanded, he was fired on 8 November 2004.

Moore's complaints were investigated at the time (before the crisis) by accountancy firm [[KPMG]], who concluded that HBOS had appropriate risk controls in place; this was accepted by the [[Financial Services Authority]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2009/02/why_crosby_resigned.html |title=Peston's Picks: Why Sir James Crosby resigned |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2004 Moore was dismissed by [[HBOS]]. He claimed this was because he had told HBOS's board that the bank was taking excessive risks with its aggressive sales culture which was out of balance with its systems and controls. He passed his concerns about HBOS to the [[Financial Services Authority|FSA]], who had it investigated by [[KPMG]], whose conclusion, that HBOS had appropriate risk controls in place, was accepted by the FSA.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Choice. (2009). BBC Radio 4. Tuesday 3 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Following his dismissal the bank replaced him with a retail sales manager.

He sued HBOS for [[unfair dismissal]] on the basis that the reason for his dismissal was actually his warnings of excessive risk, which if followed would have reduced the bank's profits while protecting it from what proved to be the all-too-real risk. The bank settled his claim for over half a million pounds in mid-2005.

In 2008, HBOS was forced into a merger and then bailed out by a multibillion-pound infusion of capital from the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]].

Although Moore had agreed to the [[non-disclosure agreement]] as part of his settlement, he decided to speak out after the crisis because he believed it to be in the [[public interest]] and on 10 February 2009 Moore submitted a memorandum of evidence to the UK's [[Treasury Select Committee]], which was investigating risks taken by UK banks prior to the [[credit crunch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7882581.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; UK Politics &amp;#124; Text: HBOS whistleblower statement |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-02-10 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After HBOS==
Moore runs a risk consultancy, Moore Carter and Associates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moorecarter.co.uk/ |title=Risk Governance - Regulation - Ethics - Home Page |publisher=Moorecarter.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the non-executive Chairman of [[Assetz Capital]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.assetzcapital.co.uk/about-us/the-team/ |title=About Us |publisher=Assetz Capital |date= |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[peer-to-peer lending|peer-to-peer lender]] aimed at SMEs and property developers in the UK. Moore is married with three children and currently lives in North Yorkshire.

Moore announced his intention to publish a book about the HBOS whistle blowing and subsequent events called ''"Crash, Bank, Wallop"''.&lt;ref name=RussiaToday&gt;{{cite web|title=Keiser Report: Fraudopian Diet (E601)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zslm3_u_FkY|publisher=Russia Today|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was co-authored by Mike Haworth, edited by [[Guy Mankowski]] and published in November 2015.

'''Peter Raymond Grant,''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|FRS}}, {{postnominals|country=CAN|FRSC}}, and '''Barbara Rosemary Grant,''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|FRS}}, {{postnominals|country=CAN|FRSC}}, are a British couple who are [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]] at [[Princeton University]]. Each currently holds the position of [[emeritus]] professor. They are known for their work with [[Darwin's finches]] on [[Daphne Major]], one of the [[Galápagos Islands]]. Since 1973, the Grants have spent six months of every year  capturing, tagging, and taking blood samples from finches on the island. They have worked to show that [[natural selection]] can be seen within a single lifetime, or even within a couple of years. [[Charles Darwin]] originally thought that natural selection was a long, drawn out process. The Grants have shown that these changes in populations can happen very quickly.

In 1994, they were awarded the [[Leidy Award]] from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="PANSP"&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 2007|title=The Four Awards Bestowed by The Academy of Natural Sciences and Their Recipients|journal=Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia|publisher=The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia |volume=156 |issue=1 |pages=403–404 |doi=10.1635/0097-3157(2007)156[403:TFABBT]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grants were the subject of the book ''[[The Beak of the Finch|The Beak of the Finch: A Story of Evolution in Our Time]]'' by [[Jonathan Weiner]], which won the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] in 1995.

In 2003, the Grants were joint recipients of the [[Loye and Alden Miller Research Award]]. They won the 2005 [[Balzan Prize]] for Population Biology.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.balzan.org//premiati.aspx?lang=en&amp;Codice=1117&amp;show=1&amp;from=1117&amp;from1=0|title=Fondazione Balzan|publisher=balzan.org|access-date=24 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052556/http://www.balzan.org//premiati.aspx?lang=en&amp;Codice=1117&amp;show=1&amp;from=1117&amp;from1=0|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Balzan Prize citation states:
:Peter and Rosemary Grant are distinguished for their remarkable long-term studies demonstrating evolution in action in Galápagos finches. They have demonstrated how very rapid changes in body and beak size in response to changes in the food supply are driven by natural selection. They have also elucidated the mechanisms by which new species arise and how genetic diversity is maintained in natural populations. The work of the Grants has had a seminal influence in the fields of population biology, evolution, and ecology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Grants are both [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellows of the Royal Society]], Peter in 1987, and Rosemary in 2007. In 2008 the Grants were among the thirteen recipients of the [[Darwin-Wallace Medal]], which is bestowed every fifty years by the [[Linnean Society of London]]. In 2009 they were recipients of the annual [[Kyoto Prize]] in basic sciences, an international award honouring significant contributions to the scientific, cultural and spiritual betterment of mankind.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2017, they received the [[Royal Medal]] in Biology "for their research on the ecology and evolution of Darwin’s finches on the Galapagos, demonstrating that natural selection occurs frequently and that evolution is rapid as a result".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Peter and Rosemary Grant receive Royal Medal in Biology|url=https://www.princeton.edu/news/2017/07/18/peter-and-rosemary-grant-receive-royal-medal-biology|accessdate=18 July 2017|work=Princeton University|agency=Office of Communications|date=18 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719232815/https://www.princeton.edu/news/2017/07/18/peter-and-rosemary-grant-receive-royal-medal-biology|archivedate=19 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
As young children, Rosemary and Peter were both fascinated with the world around them and the animals that inhabited their environments. Their curiosity helped shape them as scientists.&lt;ref name=ahmed1&gt;Ahmed, F. "Profile of Peter R. Grant." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 107.13 (2010): 5703–705. Web. 1 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Rosemary Grant was born in [[Arnside]], England in 1936. She grew up enjoying the diversity of her surroundings; she collected plant fossils and compared them to living look-alikes. At age 12, she read Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. Despite what teachers told her at school, she was destined to go to university to obtain a degree.&lt;ref name="nair2"&gt;Nair, P. "Profile of B. Rosemary Grant." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 108.30 (2011): 12195-2197. Web. 3 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from the [[University of Edinburgh]] with a degree in [[Zoology]] in 1960. For the next year, she studied [[genetics]] under [[Conrad Waddington]] and then devised a dissertation to study isolated populations of fish. This project was put on hold when she accepted a biology teaching job at the [[University of British Columbia]],&lt;ref name="nair2" /&gt; where she met Peter Grant.&lt;ref name="ahmed1" /&gt;

Peter Raymond Grant was born in 1936 in London, but relocated to the English countryside to avoid bombings during World War II. He attended school at the Surrey-Hampshire border where he collected insects and studied flowers.&lt;ref name="ahmed1" /&gt; He attended the [[University of Cambridge]], then moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and began work on a doctoral degree in Zoology at the University of British Columbia. A few days after beginning his research he met Rosemary; they were married a year later.&lt;ref name="ahmed1" /&gt;

==Research==

For his doctoral degree, Peter Grant studied the relationship between ecology and evolution and how they were interrelated. The Grants travelled to the [[Islas Marías|Tres Marias Islands]] off Mexico to conduct field studies of the birds that inhabited the island.&lt;ref name="ahmed1" /&gt; They compared the differences of bill length to body size between populations living on the Islands and the nearby mainland. Of the birds studied, eleven species were not significantly different between the mainland and the islands; four species were significantly less variable on the islands, and one species was significantly more variable.&lt;ref name="grant3"&gt;Grant, P. R. "Bill length variability in birds of the Tres Marias Islands, Mexico." Canadian Journal of Zoology 45.5 (1967): 805–815.&lt;/ref&gt; On average, the birds on the islands had larger beaks. The Grants attributed these differences to what foods were available, and what was available was dependent on competitors. The bigger beaks indicated a greater range of foods present in the environment.&lt;ref name="ahmed1" /&gt;

In 1965, Peter Grant accepted tenure at McGill University in Montreal. He created a method to test the Competition Hypothesis to see if it worked today as it did in the past.&lt;ref name=ahmed1 /&gt; This research was done on grassland voles and woodland mice. The study looked at the competitiveness between populations of rodents and among rodent species.&lt;ref name=grant4&gt;Grant, P. R. Grant, P. R. "Interspecific Competition Among Rodents." Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, vol. 3, 1972, pp.&amp;nbsp;79–106. www.jstor.org/stable/2096843.&lt;/ref&gt; In his article "Interspecific Competition Among Rodents", he concluded that competitive interaction for space is common among many rodent species, not just the species that have been studied in detail.&lt;ref name=grant4 /&gt; Grant also states that there are many causes for increased competition: reproduction, resources, amount of space, and invasion of other species.&lt;ref name=grant4 /&gt;

[[Daphne Major]], in the [[Galápagos Islands]], was a perfect place to perform experiments and study changes within birds. It was isolated and uninhabited; any changes that were to occur to the land and environment would be due to natural forces with no human destruction.&lt;ref name=watch5&gt;"Watching Evolution Happen in Two Lifetimes." Interview by Emily Singer. Quanta Magazine 22 September 2016: n. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The island provided the best environment to study natural selection; seasons of heavy rain switched to seasons of extended drought. With these environmental changes brought changes in the types of foods available to the birds. The Grants would study this for the next few decades of their lives.

In 1973, the Grants headed out on what they thought would be a two-year study on the island of Daphne Major. There they would study evolution and ultimately determine what drives the formation of new species.&lt;ref name=watch5 /&gt; There are thirteen species of [[Darwin's finches|finch]] that live on the island; five of these are tree finch, one warbler finch, one vegetarian finch, and six species of ground finch. These birds provide a great way to study [[adaptive radiation]]. Their beaks are specific to the type of diet they eat, which in turn is reflective of the food available. The finches are easy to catch and provide a good animal to study. The Grants tagged, labelled, measured, and took blood samples of the birds they were studying. The two-year study continued through 2012.&lt;ref name=watch5 /&gt;

During the rainy season of 1977 only 24 millimetres of rain fell. Two of the main finch species were hit exceptionally hard and many of them died.&lt;ref name=bach7&gt;Bell, Achenbach, Joel. "The People Who Saw Evolution." Princeton Alumni Weekly 23 April 2014: n. pag. Web. 9 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of rain caused major food sources to become scarce, causing the need to find alternative food sources. The smaller, softer seeds ran out, leaving only the larger, tougher seeds. The finch species with smaller beaks struggled to find alternate seeds to eat.&lt;ref name=bach7 /&gt; The following two years suggested that natural selection could happen very rapidly. Because the smaller finch species could not eat the large seeds, they died off. Finches with larger beaks were able to eat the seeds and reproduce. The population in the years following the drought in 1977 had "measurably larger" beaks than had the previous birds.

In 1981, the Grants came across a bird they had never seen before. It was heavier than the other ground finches by more than five grams.&lt;ref name=cressey8&gt;Cressey, Daniel. "Darwin's Finches Tracked to Reveal Evolution in Action." Nature (2009): n. pag. Web. 8 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; They called this bird Big Bird. It had many different characteristics than those of the native finches: a strange call, extra glossy feathers, it could eat both large and small seeds, and could also eat the nectar, pollen, and seeds of the cacti that grow on the island.&lt;ref name=watch5 /&gt; Big Bird is thought to be a hybrid of the medium-beaked ground finch and the cactus finch.&lt;ref name=cressey8 /&gt; Although hybrids do happen, many of the birds living on the island tend to stick within their own species.&lt;ref name=weiner9&gt;Daniel. Weiner, Jonathan. "In Darwin's Footsteps." New York Times 4 August 2014: n. pag. Web. 9 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Big Bird lived for thirteen years, and his descendants have only mated within themselves for the past thirty years, a total of seven generations.&lt;ref name=weiner9 /&gt;

Over the course of 1982–1983, [[El Niño]] brought a steady eight months of rain. In a normal rainy season Daphne Major usually gets two months of rain.&lt;ref name=bell6&gt;Bell, G. "Every Inch a Finch: A Commentary on Grant (1993) 'Hybridization of Darwin's Finches on Isla Daphne Major, Galapagos'" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 370.1666 (2015): 20140287. Web. 9 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The excessive rain brought a turnover in the types of vegetation growing on the island. The seeds shifted from large, hard to crack seeds to many different types of small, softer seeds. This gave birds with smaller beaks an advantage when another drought hit the following year.&lt;ref name=bell6 /&gt; Small-beaked finch could eat all of the small seeds faster than the larger beaked birds could get to them.

In 2003, a drought similar in severity to the 1977 drought occurred on the island. However, in the time between the droughts (beginning in late 1982), the large ground finch ([[Large ground finch|''Geospiza magnirostris'']]) had established a breeding population on the island. This species has diet overlap with the medium ground finch (''[[Medium ground finch|G. fortis]]''[[Medium ground finch|)]], so they are potential competitors. The 2003 drought and resulting decrease in food supply may have increased these species' competition with each other, particularly for the larger seeds in the medium ground finches' diet. Following the drought, the medium ground finch population had a decline in average beak size, in contrast to the increase in size found following the 1977 drought. This was hypothesized to be due to the presence of the large ground finch; the smaller-beaked individuals of the medium ground finch may have been able to survive better due to a lack of competition over large seeds with the large ground finch. This is an example of [[character displacement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grant|first=Peter R.|last2=Grant|first2=B. Rosemary|date=14 July 2006|title=Evolution of Character Displacement in Darwin's Finches|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5784/224|journal=Science|language=en|volume=313|issue=5784|pages=224–226|doi=10.1126/science.1128374|issn=0036-8075|pmid=16840700|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122034129/http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5784/224|archivedate=22 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant findings==
In ''Evolution: Making Sense of Life'', the takeaway from the Grants' 40-year study can be broken down into three major lessons. The first is that natural selection is a variable, constantly changing process. The fact that they studied the island in both times of excessive rain and drought provides a better picture of what happens to populations over time. The next lesson learned is that evolution can actually be a fairly rapid process. It does not take millions of years; these processes can be seen in as little as two years. Lastly, and as the author states, most importantly, selection can change over time. During some years, selection will favour those birds with larger beaks. Other years with substantial amounts of smaller seeds, selection will favour the birds with the smaller beaks.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, Carl, and Douglas John Emlen. "Natural Selection: Empirical Studies in the Wild." Evolution: Making Sense of Life. Greenwood Village, CO: Roberts, 2013. 220-23. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2003 paper, the Grants wrap up their decades-long study by stating that selection oscillates in a direction. For this reason, neither the medium ground finch nor the cactus finch has stayed [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] the same over the course of the experiment. The average beak and body size are not the same today for either species as they were when the study first began.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, B. Rosemary, and Peter R. Grant. "What Darwin's Finches Can Teach Us about the Evolutionary Origin and Regulation of Biodiversity." BioScience 53.10 (2003): 965. Web. 10 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The Grants also state that these changes in morphology and [[phenotypes]] could not have been predicted at the beginning.&lt;ref name="bio13"&gt;"Peter and Rosemary Grant -Bio-bibliography." International Balzan Prize Foundation. Fondazione Internazionale Balzan "Premio", Jan. 2009. Web. 10 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; They were able to witness the evolution of the finch species as a result of the inconsistent and harsh environment of Daphne Major directly.

'''Puerto Ricans''' ({{lang-es|Puertorriqueños}}; or '''boricuas''') are people from [[Puerto Rico]], the inhabitants and citizens of [[Puerto Rico]], and their descendants. Puerto Rico is home to people of many different national origins.

==Overview==
{{Main article|Demographics of Puerto Rico}}
The culture held in common by most Puerto Ricans is referred to as [[mainstream]] [[Puerto Rican culture]], a [[Western culture]] largely derived from the traditions of [[Spain]], and more specifically [[Andalusia]] and the [[Canary Islands]]. Over 90% of Puerto Ricans descend from migrants from these two southern regions of Spain. Puerto Rico has also been influenced by [[Afro-Puerto Rican|African]] culture, Afro-Puerto Ricans being a significant minority. Puerto Rico has also received immigration from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia as well as from other European countries such as France, Ireland, Italy and Germany. Recent studies in population genetics have concluded that Puerto Rican gene pool is on average predominantly European, with a significant Sub-Saharan African, Guanche and Indigenous American substrate, the latter two originating in the aboriginal people of the Canary Islands and Puerto Rico's pre-Hispanic Taíno inhabitants, respectively.&lt;ref name="archive.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lacomunidad.elpais.com/amazonasfilm/2009/7/12/un-estudio-del-genoma-taino-y-guanche-adn-o-dna-primera-parte|title=La Comunidad » DOCUMENTALES GRATIS » UN ESTUDIO DEL GENOMA TAINO Y GUANCHE.

The population of Puerto Ricans and descendants is estimated to be between 8 and 10 million worldwide, with most living on the islands of Puerto Rico and in the United States mainland. Within the United States, Puerto Ricans are present in all states of the Union, and the states with the largest populations of Puerto Ricans relative to the national population of Puerto Ricans in the United States at large are the states of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Florida]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Pennsylvania]], with large populations also in [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[California]], [[Illinois]], and [[Texas]].&lt;ref name="2010 Census"&gt;{{cite news | title=2010 Census | publisher=Medgar Evers College | url=http://2010.census.gov/partners/materials/factsheets-pr.php | accessdate=2010-04-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611082314/http://2010.census.gov/partners/materials/factsheets-pr.php | archivedate=2010-06-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_SF1_QTP10&amp;prodType=table US Census Bureau: Table QT-P10 Hispanic or Latino by Type: 2010] Retrieved 25 March 2012 - select state from drop-down menu&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestry==
The original inhabitants of Puerto Rico are the [[Taíno people|Taíno]], who called the island ''Borikén''; however, as in other parts of the Americas, the native people soon diminished in number after the arrival of European settlers.  Besides [[miscegenation]], the negative impact on the numbers of Amerindian people, especially in Puerto Rico, was almost entirely the result of Old World diseases that the Amerindians had no natural/bodily defenses against, including [[measles]], [[chicken pox]], [[mumps]], [[influenza]], and even the [[common cold]].  In fact, it was estimated that the majority of all the Amerindian inhabitants of the New World died out due to contact and contamination with those Old World diseases, while those that survived were further reduced through deaths by warfare with each other and with Europeans.

Both run-away and freed African slaves (the Spanish, upon establishing a foothold, quickly began to import African slaves to work in expanding their colonies in the Caribbean) were in Puerto Rico.  This interbreeding was far more common in Latin America because of those Spanish and Portuguese mercantile colonial policies exemplified by the oft-romanticized male conquistadors (e.g. [[Hernán Cortés]]).  Aside from the presence of slaves, some indication for why the Amerindian population was so diluted was the tendency for conquistadors to bring with them scores of single men hoping to serve God, country, or their own interests. All of these factors would indeed prove detrimental for the Taínos in Puerto Rico and surrounding Caribbean islands.
[[File:Real Cédula de Gracia.jpg|left|100px|thumb|Royal Decree of Graces, 1815]]
In the 16th century, a significant depth of Puerto Rican culture began to develop with the [[African immigration to Puerto Rico|import of African slaves]] by the Spanish, as well as by the French, the Portuguese, the British, and the Dutch. Thousands of Spanish settlers also immigrated to Puerto Rico from the [[Canary Islands]] during the 18th and 19th centuries, so many so that whole Puerto Rican villages and towns were founded by Canarian immigrants, and their descendants would later form a majority of the population on the island.

In 1791, the slaves in Saint-Domingue ([[Haiti]]), revolted against their [[French immigration to Puerto Rico|French]] masters. Many of the French escaped to Puerto Rico via what is now the [[Dominican Republic]] and settled in the west coast of the island, especially in [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico|Mayagüez]]. Some Puerto Ricans are of [[British people|British]] heritage, most notably [[Scottish people]] and [[English people]] who came to reside there in the 17th and 18th centuries.

When Spain revived the [[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815]] with the intention of attracting non-Hispanics to settle in the island, thousands of [[Corsicans]] (though the island was French since 1768 the population spoke an Italian dialect similar to Tuscan Italian) during the 19th century immigrated to Puerto Rico, along with [[German immigration to Puerto Rico|German immigrants]] as well as [[Irish immigration to Puerto Rico|Irish immigrants]] who were affected by the [[Irish Potato Famine|Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s]], immigrated to Puerto Rico. They were followed by smaller waves from other European countries and China.

During the early 20th century [[Jewish immigration to Puerto Rico|Jews]] began to settle in Puerto Rico. The first large group of [[Sephardi Jews|Jews]] to settle in Puerto Rico were European [[refugee]]s fleeing [[German–occupied Europe]] in the 1930s and 1940s. The second influx of Jews to the island came in the 1950s, when thousands of [[History of the Jews in Cuba|Cuban Jews]] fled after [[Fidel Castro]] came to power.&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Puerto_Rico.html |title=Puerto Rico Virtual Jewish History Tour |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnogenesis===
The native Taino population began to dwindle, with the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, through disease and [[miscegenation]].&lt;ref name="kacike.org"&gt;[http://www.kacike.org/GuitarEnglish.html ''Documenting the Myth of Taino Extinction.'' Dr. Lynne Guitar. KACIKE: Journal of Caribbean Amerindian History and Anthropology.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627042932/http://www.kacike.org/GuitarEnglish.html |date=June 27, 2009 }} Retrieved May 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Spaniard men took Taino and West African wives and in the first centuries of the Spanish colonial period the island was overwhelmingly racially mixed. However, under Spanish rule, mass immigration shifted the ethnic make-up of the island, as a result of the [[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815]]. Puerto Rico went from being two-thirds black and mulatto in the beginning of the 19th century, to being nearly 80% white by the middle of the 20th century.

Studies have shown that the racial ancestry mixture of the average Puerto Rican (regardless of racial self-identity) is about 64% European, 21% West and North African (including Canary Islander Guanche), and 15% Taino/Amerindian, with European ancestry strongest on the west side of the island and West African ancestry strongest on the east side, and consistent levels of Taino ancestry throughout the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.livescience.com/37624-mapping-puerto-rican-heritage.html|title=Mapping Puerto Rican Heritage with Spit and Genomics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of a sample of 96 healthy self-identified White Puerto Ricans and self-identified Black Puerto Ricans in the U.S. showed that, although all carried a contribution from all 3 ancestral populations (European, African, and Amerindian), the proportions showed significant variation. Depending on individuals, although often correlating with their self-identified race, African ancestry ranged from less than 10% to over 50%, while European ancestry ranged from under 20% to over 80%.

The [[European ethnic groups|European]] ancestry of Puerto Ricans comes primarily from one source: [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] (including [[Canarian people|Canarians]], [[Catalan people|Catalans]], [[Castilian people|Castilians]], [[Galician people|Galicians]], [[Asturian people|Asturians]], [[Andalusian people|Andalusians]], and [[Basque people|Basques]]).
The Canarian cultural influence in Puerto Rico is one of the most important components in which many villages were founded from these immigrants, which started from 1493 to 1890 and beyond. Many Spaniards, especially Canarians, chose Puerto Rico because of its Hispanic ties and relative proximity in comparison with other former Spanish colonies. They searched for security and stability in an environment similar to that of the Canary Islands and Puerto Rico was the most suitable. This began as a temporary exile which became a permanent relocation and the last significant wave of Spanish or European migration to Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?hl=en-GB&amp;v=HmRIxmMxY6c&amp;gl=GB |title=MANUEL MORA MORALES: Canarios en Puerto Rico.

===Modern identity===
{{Main article|Culture of Puerto Rico}}
The Puerto Rico of today has come to form some of its own social customs, cultural matrix, historically rooted traditions, and its own unique pronunciation, vocabulary, and idiomatic expressions within the [[Spanish language]], known as [[Puerto Rican Spanish]]. Even after the attempted assimilation of Puerto Rico into the United States in the early 20th century, the majority of the people of Puerto Rico feel pride in their nationality as "Puerto Ricans", regardless of the individual's particular racial, ethnic, political, or economic background.  Many Puerto Ricans are consciously aware of the rich contribution of all cultures represented on the island.  This diversity can be seen in the everyday lifestyle of many Puerto Ricans such as the profound Latin, African, and Taíno influences regarding food, music, dance, and architecture.

Public school instruction in Puerto Rico is conducted almost entirely in Spanish.

Objections from teaching staff are common, perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/08/puerto-rico-governor-fortuno-bilingual_n_1501225.html ''Puerto Rico Governor Luis Fortuño Proposes Plan For Island's Public Schools To Teach In English Instead Of Spanish.''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831055841/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/08/puerto-rico-governor-fortuno-bilingual_n_1501225.html |date=August 31, 2012 }} Danica Coto.

The Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the Spanish spoken elsewhere. While the Spanish spoken in all Iberian, Mediterranean and Atlantic Spanish Maritime Provinces was brought to the island over the centuries, the most profound regional influence on the Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has been from that spoken in the present-day Canary Islands. The Spanish of Puerto Rico also includes occasional [[Taíno]] words, typically in the context of vegetation, natural phenomena or primitive musical instruments. Similarly, words attributed to primarily West [[African languages]] were adopted in the contexts of foods, music or dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.languageeducationpolicy.org/lepbyworldregion/caribbeanpuertorico.html |title=Language Education Policy in Puerto Rico  |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2013 |website=Language Education Policy Studies |publisher=International Association for Language Education Policy Studies

The majority of Puerto Ricans in the Island are Christians. [[Spiritist]]s have a large secondary following. [[Muslim]]s, [[Hindu]]s, [[Jew]]s, and [[Buddhist]]s all have a small presence as well. [[Roman Catholicism]] has been the main Christian sect among Puerto Ricans since the arrival of the Spanish in the 15th century, but the presence of [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Latter-day Saint|Mormon]], [[Pentecostal]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] denominations has increased under U.S. sovereignty, making modern Puerto Rico an inter-denominational, multi-religious community.  The Afro-Caribbean religion [[Santería]] is also practiced.

In 1998, a news report stated that "Puerto Rico [was] no longer predominantly Catholic". Pollster Pablo Ramos wrote that the population was 38% Roman Catholic, 28% Pentecostal, and 18% were members of independent churches.&lt;ref&gt;The San Juan Star, Sunday, 12 April 1998: "Study reflects growing numbers of churchgoers".&lt;/ref&gt;  However, an [[Associated Press]] article in March 2014 stated that "more than 70 percent of [Puerto Ricans] identify themselves as Catholic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/03/12/catholic-church-and-puerto-rico-officials-at-odds-in-widening-sex-abuse.html |title=Catholic Church and Puerto Rico officials at odds in widening sex abuse investigation |author=Associated Press&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=March 12, 2014 |website=FOX News |publisher=FOX News |access-date=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA World Factbook reports that 85% of the population of Puerto Rico identifies as Roman Catholic, while 15% identify as Protestant and Other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rq.html |title=Puerto Rico - People and Society |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=CIA Library |publisher=CIA |access-date=February 17, 2017 |quote=Roman Catholic 85%, Protestant and other 15%}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boricua==
Puerto Ricans often proudly identify themselves as ''Boricua'' (formerly also spelled ''Boriquén'', ''Borinquén'', or ''Borinqueño''), derived from the Taíno word ''Boriken'', to illustrate their recognition of the island's Taíno heritage.  The word ''Boriken'' translates to "the great land of the valiant and noble Lord".  Borikén was used by the original Taíno population to refer to the island of Puerto Rico before the arrival of the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qAMQAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=porto+rico#v=onepage&amp;q=land%20of%20the%20valiant%20lord&amp;f=false |title=Advance in the Antilles: the new era in Cuba and Porto Rico - Howard Benjamin Grose |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23|year=1910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word ''Boricua'' has been popularized in the island and abroad by descendants of Puerto Rico heritage, commonly using the phrase ''yo soy Boricua'' ("I am Boricua") to identify themselves as Puerto Ricans. Other variations which are also widely used are ''Borinqueño'' and ''Borincano'', meaning "from Borinquen". The first recorded use of the word Boricua comes from [[Christopher Columbus]] in his Letter to the Sovereigns of 4 March 1493.&lt;ref&gt;"Between the islands of Cardo and Española there is another island they call Borinque, all of it is short distance form the other region of the island of Juana that they call Cuba" (Letter to the Sovereigns, trans. Margarita Zamora, ''New World Encounters'', University of California Press, 1993).

==Political and international status==
{{Puerto Ricans}}
The federal [[Naturalization Act of 1790|Naturalization Act]], signed into law on March 26, 1790 by [[George Washington]], explicitly barred anyone not of the White "race" from applying for U.S. citizenship. This law remained in effect until the 1950s, although its enforcement was tightened in the late nineteenth century regarding Asian immigrants, and by the Johnson-Reed act of 1924 imposing immigration quotas. In short, until late in the twentieth century, only immigrants of the White "race" could hope to become naturalized citizens. The people of Puerto Rico were declared U.S. citizens in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.fsu.edu/Journals/lawreview/frames/261/romatxt.html#heading11 |title=The Vision of a White, English-Speaking America |publisher=Law.fsu.edu |accessdate=2015-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411174113/http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/lawreview/frames/261/romatxt.html#heading11 |archivedate=2012-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/377/37717104.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406174922/http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/377/37717104.pdf |date=April 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puerto Ricans became citizens of the United States as a result of the passage of the [[Jones-Shafroth Act]] of 1917.

Delegate selection processes frequently have resulted in [[presidential primaries]] being held in Puerto Rico.  U.S. Citizens residing in Puerto Rico do not elect [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] or [[United States Senate|Senators]], however, Puerto Rico is represented in the House of Representatives by an elected representative commonly known as the [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico|Resident Commissioner]], who has the same duties and obligations as a representative, with the exception of being able to cast votes on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor. The Resident Commissioner is elected by Puerto Ricans to a four-year term and does serve on [[United States congressional committee|congressional committee]]. Puerto Ricans residing in the U.S. states have all rights and privileges of other U.S. citizens living in the states.

As statutory U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans born in Puerto Rico may enlist in the [[U.S. military]] and have been included in the compulsory draft when it has been in effect. Puerto Ricans have fully participated in all [[Timeline of United States military operations|U.S. wars and military conflicts]] since 1898, such as [[Puerto Ricans in World War I|World War I]], [[Puerto Ricans in World War II|World War II]], the [[65th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Korean War]], the [[Puerto Ricans in the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], and the [[Iraq war]].

Since 2007, the Puerto Rico State Department has developed a protocol to issue certificates of Puerto Rican citizenship to Puerto Ricans. In order to be eligible, applicants must have been born in Puerto Rico; born outside of Puerto Rico to a Puerto Rican-born parent; or be an American citizen with at least one year residence in Puerto Rico. The citizenship is internationally recognized by Spain, which considers Puerto Rico to be an Ibero-American nation. Therefore, Puerto Rican citizens have the ability to apply for Spanish citizenship after only two years residency in Spain (instead of the standard 10 years).

===Decolonization and status referendums===
Since 1953, the [[UN]] has been considering the [[political status of Puerto Rico]] and how to assist it in achieving "independence" or "decolonization". In 1978, the Special Committee determined that a "colonial relationship" existed between the US and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nacla.org/article/puerto-rico-united-nations |title=Puerto Rico at the United Nations |last=López |first=Ana M. |date=2014 |website=The North American Congress on Latin America  |publisher=The North American Congress on Latin America  |access-date=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the UN's Special Committee has often referred to Puerto Rico as a nation in its reports, because, internationally, the people of Puerto Rico are often considered to be a Caribbean nation with their own national identity.&lt;ref name="United Nations.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, in a June 2016 report, the Special Committee called for the United States to expedite the process to allow self-determination in Puerto Rico. More specifically, the group called on the United States to expedite a process that would allow the people of Puerto Rico to exercise fully their right to self-determination and independence. ... allow the Puerto Rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner, and to address their urgent economic and social needs, including unemployment, marginalization, insolvency and poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/gacol3296.doc.htm |title=Special Committee on Decolonization Approves Text Calling upon United States Government to Expedite Self-Determination Process for Puerto Rico |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=June 20, 2016 |website=United Nations |publisher=UN |access-date=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puerto Rico has held four referendums to determine whether to retain its status as a territory or to switch to some other status such as statehood. The fourth, the [[Puerto Rican status referendum, 2012]] occurred on November 6, 2012. The result a 54% majority of the ballots cast against the continuation of the island's territorial political status, and in favor of a new status. Of votes for new status, a 61.1% majority chose statehood.&lt;ref name="cbsnews1"&gt;{{cite web|author = November 7, 2012, 9:55 AM|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57546260/puerto-rico-votes-for-u.s-statehood-in-non-binding-referendum/|title = Puerto Rico votes for U.S. statehood in non-binding referendum|publisher = CBS News|date = |accessdate = 2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceepur.org/REYDI_NocheDelEvento/index.html#en/default/OPCIONES_NO_TERRITORIALES_ISLA.xml |accessdate=November 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107090851/http://www.ceepur.org/REYDI_NocheDelEvento/index.html |archivedate=November 7, 2012 }}

In all earlier referenda, votes for statehood were matched almost equally by votes for remaining an American territory, with the remainder for independence. Support for U.S. statehood has risen in each successive popular referendum.&lt;ref name="letpuertoricodecide1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.letpuertoricodecide.com/details.php?cid=4|title = An Introduction to Puerto Rico's Status Debate|publisher = Let Puerto Rico Decide|accessdate = 2012-03-29|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120216191957/http://www.letpuertoricodecide.com/details.php?cid=4|archivedate = 2012-02-16|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/07/politics/election-puerto-rico/index.html?iref=allsearch Puerto Ricans favor statehood for first time], CNN, 7 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth, the [[Puerto Rican status referendum, 2017]],  was held on June 11, 2017 and offered three options: "Statehood,"  "Independence/Free Association," and "Current Territorial Status." With 23% of register voters casting ballots, 97% voted for statehood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Robles |first=Frances |date=June 11, 2017 |title=23% of Puerto Ricans Vote in Referendum, 97% of Them for Statehood |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/11/us/puerto-ricans-vote-on-the-question-of-statehood.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |location=New York |access-date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Benefits of statehood would include an additional $10 billion per year in federal funds, the right to vote in presidential elections, higher Social Security and Medicare benefits, and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy. The latter is currently prohibited.&lt;ref name="wapo-2017-coto-danica"&gt;{{cite news|last=Coto|first=Danica|date=February 3, 2017|title=Puerto Rico gov approves referendum in quest for statehood|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/puerto-rico-gov-approves-referendum-in-quest-for-statehood/2017/02/03/ddea7392-ea54-11e6-903d-9b11ed7d8d2a_story.html|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|location=DC|access-date=February 17, 2017|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204020835/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/puerto-rico-gov-approves-referendum-in-quest-for-statehood/2017/02/03/ddea7392-ea54-11e6-903d-9b11ed7d8d2a_story.html|archive-date=February 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with the Puerto Ricans' vote for statehood, action by the [[United States Congress]] would be necessary to implement changes to the status of Puerto Rico under the [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Federal property and the Territorial Clause|Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="wapo-2017-coto-danica" /&gt;

'''Richard Marvin DeVos Sr.''' (March 4, 1926 – September 6, 2018) was an American [[billionaire]] businessman, co-founder of [[Amway]] with [[Jay Van Andel]] (company restructured as [[Alticor]] in 2000), and owner of the [[Orlando Magic]] basketball team. In 2012, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine listed him as the 60th-wealthiest person in the United States, and the 205th-richest in the world, with an estimated net worth of $5.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/richard-devos Forbes magazine profile of Richard DeVos] ''Forbes''. Retrieved March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
DeVos was born in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], the son of Ethel Ruth (Dekker) and Simon Cornelius DeVos, who worked in the electrical business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sekpAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Simon+Cornelius+and+Ethel+Ruth+(Dekker)+De+Vos%22&amp;dq=%22Simon+Cornelius+and+Ethel+Ruth+(Dekker)+De+Vos%22|title=The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography: Current volume|author=|date=October 20, 1967|publisher=J.T. White|accessdate=October 20, 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Calvin College]] and was a member of the [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]] Fraternity. He served in the military in [[World War II]] in the [[United States Army Air Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;The Possible Dream, by Charles Paul Conn, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Books written by him include ''Compassionate Capitalism'' and ''Hope From My Heart: Ten Lessons For Life''. The latter reflects his feelings after successfully undergoing a [[heart transplant]] operation in 1997. This was preceded by two heart-bypass operations in 1983 and 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fate, patience bring DeVos a new heart: Amway cofounder back after journey for life | work= Detroit Free Press|last=Levin|first=Doron|date=October 8, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, DeVos published a book about his success, co-authored with [[Charles Paul Conn]], titled ''Believe!''.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt; In 2014 he published his memoirs titled "Simply Rich".&lt;ref name="KR"&gt;{{cite web |title=Simply Rich |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/rich-devos/simply-rich/ |publisher=Kirkus Reviews |accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports ownership==
[[File:Richard DeVos 2010.jpg|thumb|DeVos welcoming fans before a game in October 2010]]
DeVos was the owner of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] team [[Orlando Magic]], having bought the team in 1991 for $85 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/20/sports/nba-orlando-team-sold.html | title = Orlando Team Sold | accessdate = July 27, 2010 | date = September 20, 1991 | work = [[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became interested in the team after an unsuccessful effort to acquire a [[Major League Baseball]] expansion franchise for Orlando.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/20/sports/nba-orlando-team-sold.html|title=N.B.A. Orlando Team Sold|author=|date=September 20, 1991|publisher=|accessdate=February 12, 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeVos also formerly owned the [[Orlando Solar Bears (IHL)|Orlando Solar Bears]], [[Grand Rapids Griffins]], and the [[Kansas City Blades]], three [[International Hockey League (1945–2001)|International Hockey League]] franchises before that league folded;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Magic, DeVos family plan to buy Orlando Solar Bears |url=https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2017/05/03/magic-devos-family-plan-to-buy-orlando-solar-bears |accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Solar Bears and Blades were closed as a result of the league folding, while the Griffins moved to the [[American Hockey League]], and are now under the ownership of [[Dan DeVos]], one of Richard's sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DAN DEVOS |url=https://www.griffinshockey.com/team/front-office/index.html?staff_id=1 |website=griffinshockey.com |accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeVos asked [[Orange County, Florida]], to help pay for the Orlando Magic's new arena using county funds and Dema Stobell's Corporation money. [[Amway]] pays for the naming rights to [[Amway Center]]. The use of public money was controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nothing but the best for new arena: Look what your taxes helped buy|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-03-13/news/os-magic-arena-furnishings-20100313_1_new-arena-magic-executives-amway-arena|accessdate=March 13, 2010|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
He co-founded the [[Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation]], an [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] foundation and grant-making body in 1970.&lt;ref name="Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation"&gt;[http://old.mediatransparency.org/funderprofile.php?funderID=17 Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725000000/http://old.mediatransparency.org/funderprofile.php?funderID=17 |date=July 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tgci.com/funding/fdnresultnew.asp?thisID=6312|title=Funding State by State|author=The Grantsmanship Center|website=The Grantsmanship Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DeVoses were known in their philanthropy for contributing to education, health care, arts and historic causes like [[Mount Vernon]], and free-market think tanks such as [[The Heritage Foundation]] and [[American Enterprise Institute|AEI]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2016/01/how_mlive_analyzed_devos_famil.html How MLive analyzed DeVos family's $90.9 million in annual donations], mlive.com, January 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the DeVoses, the core of their giving is local. "A focus of our philanthropy has always been our home area. We want to create an atmosphere for everyone to improve their circumstances while advancing our community, whether through Christian compassion, education, health care, or the arts."&lt;ref name="philanthropyroundtable.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/updates_on_past_winners_richard_and_helen_devos|title=Updates on Past Winners, 2001–2013|website=philanthropyroundtable.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DeVoses gave money to organizations ranging from local schools to the regional symphony. According to the Philanthropy Roundtable, their giving is "helping turn Grand Rapids, Michigan, into one of the livelier and healthier small cities in the U.S. When the couple won their Simon Prize in 2006, they distributed the award money to eight local organizations in western Michigan 'whose leaders all demonstrated resourcefulness in helping people help themselves'".&lt;ref name="philanthropyroundtable.org"/&gt;

'''Richard Allan "Ricky" Kasso Jr.''' (March 29, 1967 – July 7, 1984) murdered his 17-year-old friend Gary Lauwers in [[Northport, New York]], on June 19, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pollack |first1=Jesse P. |title=The Acid King |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=1481482289 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other teens, Jimmy Troiano and Albert Quinones, were present at the murder, which took place in the Aztakea Woods of Northport while all four were high on what they believed to be [[mescaline]], but was most likely [[LSD]].

The murder became sensational news in [[New York City]] and across the nation due to the alleged torture of Lauwers and supposed [[occult]] aspects of the murder. The murder took place during a [[Satanic ritual abuse|period when there was much public concern]]&lt;ref name="trials"&gt;There were two famous suicidal deaths in the 1980s that led to trials in U.S. courts, one involving [[Judas Priest#Subliminal message trial|Judas Priest]] and a second involving [[Ozzy Osbourne#Controversy|Ozzy Osbourne]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="censorshipgroups"&gt;Several political groups advocated censorship and/or ratings for rock music, most notably [[Tipper Gore]]'s [[Parents Music Resource Center]] and [[Jerry Falwell]]'s [[Moral Majority]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="censorshippapers"&gt;A history of music censorship is given in [http://deflem.blogspot.com/1993/08/rap-rock-and-censorship-1993.html Deflem, Mathieu. 1993. "Rap, Rock, and Censorship: Popular Culture and the Technologies of Justice."] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Law and Society Association, Chicago, May 27–30, 1993. Another reference is Lynxwiler, John and Gay, David, 'Moral boundaries and deviant music: public attitudes toward heavy metal and rap', Deviant Behavior, 21:1, 63 – 85.&lt;/ref&gt; over the effects of Satanic and [[occult]] content in [[heavy metal music]] and in [[role-playing game]]s. Kasso was wearing an [[AC/DC]] T-shirt at the time of his arrest and was a fan of groups such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Judas Priest]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]].

==Biographical background==
Kasso was the son of a local high school history teacher and football coach at affluent [[Cold Spring Harbor Jr./Sr. High School|Cold Spring Harbor High School]]. Kasso was often thrown out of his home as a young teen and lived on the streets of suburban [[Northport, New York]], usually sleeping in the local woods, or in the cars, garages, backyards and houses of friends. He often took drugs, mainly [[marijuana]], [[hashish]], [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], and purple-microdots of what he believed to be [[mescaline]], but was most likely low-grade LSD. He tended to consume all of his drugs, but had on occasion dealt drugs in Northport as well. 

Kasso dabbled in the [[occult]] and [[Satanism]] and was acquainted with the members of a loosely organized group of friends who sold marijuana and referred to themselves as the "Knights of the Black Circle". After Kasso's murder of Lauwers, several newspapers and television journalists incorrectly reported the Knights as being a "Satanic cult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pollack |first1=Jesse P. |title=The Acid King |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=1481482289 |pages=247-248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasso allegedly participated in occult ceremonies, mostly in Northport, and celebrated [[Walpurgisnacht]] at the infamous [[The Amityville Horror|Amityville Horror]] house in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pollack |first1=Jesse P. |title=The Acid King |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=1481482289 |pages=137-139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasso also expressed to friends his interest in [[Anton LaVey]]'s book ''[[The Satanic Bible]]''. On at least one occasion, Ricky's parents admitted him to the South Oaks Psychiatric Hospital (formerly known as the Amityville Asylum) in [[Amityville, New York]] for drug rehabilitation and psychiatric care.

In the year prior to the murder, Kasso had been arrested for digging into a colonial-era grave inside a local cemetery. Less than a month after his arrest for this crime, Ricky contracted pneumonia and was treated at [[Long Island Jewish Medical Center|Long Island Jewish Hospital]]. During his hospital stay, his parents tried to convince the doctors to commit him for involuntary psychiatric care. However, the conclusion of the psychiatrists was that Kasso exhibited antisocial behavior but was neither [[psychosis|psychotic]] nor a violent danger, and Kasso was released upon recovering from his bout with pneumonia.

==Murder of Gary Lauwers==
The conflict between Kasso and Lauwers had started some time earlier when Lauwers stole 10 bags of PCP from Kasso's jacket, after he had passed out at a party.  Kasso confronted him soon after the incident, prompting Lauwers to immediately return five of the ten bags of PCP. Lauwers also promised to repay Kasso $50 for the five bags of PCP that had been used. Kasso reportedly beat Lauwers on four separate occasions. On the night of the murder, Kasso visited the small gazebo in the new Cow Harbor park and borrowed a radio from a friend. He then invited Lauwers to get high with him, Troiano and Quinones. The group walked to Aztakea Woods, set up camp and ingested several doses, or "hits", of what they believed to be mescaline. The drugs they ingested were tablets called "purple microdots", and while they were erroneously referred to as mescaline on the street, they were actually most likely LSD. The teens also smoked several bags of PCP before attempting to start a small fire, but all of the available firewood was too wet and would not ignite. Lauwers used his socks, as well as the sleeves from his denim jacket, as kindling to start the fire.

At some point during the night, the situation escalated into violence. Kasso scuffled with Lauwers, bit him on the neck and stabbed him in the chest. Kasso continued his assault on Lauwers, and Quinones later claimed that Troiano helped Kasso and held Lauwers during the attack. During subsequent testimony he provided under immunity, Quinones later claimed that Troiano did not assist Kasso. Lauwers was stabbed somewhere between 17 and 36 times and his eyeballs were possibly sliced out during the stabbing. During the attack, Kasso allegedly commanded Lauwers to "Say you love Satan", and Lauwers is said to have instead replied "I love my mother," before finally giving in to Kasso's demands. After the attack, Kasso and Troiano covered Lauwers' body with leaves and small branches and left it in the woods.

The date of the murder was initially misreported by the police and press as June 16, 1984. In 2018, it was revealed that the murder had actually taken place three days later on June 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pollack |first1=Jesse P. |title=The Acid King |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=1481482289 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In the aftermath, Kasso bragged about the murder to friends. Kasso claimed Satan manifested in the form of a black crow after killing Lauwers, and that the crow had cawed; something he interpreted as Satan's approval of the murder. Kasso even brought several disbelieving teens to view Lauwers' body before he and Troiano returned to the woods to bury the decomposing remains in a shallow grave. However, it wasn't until two weeks went by, on July 1, that the murder was reported to the police via an anonymous tip. On July 4, 1984, police used dogs to search Aztakea Woods and recovered the decomposing and mutilated body of Gary Lauwers. Kasso and Troiano were arrested the next day. On July 7, Kasso committed suicide by hanging himself in his jail cell.

Jimmy Troiano signed two confessions that he later recanted. Quinones gave witness account that Troiano helped Kasso during the murder, but later denied this during his testimony at Troiano's trial. Due to Quinones' drugged state at the time of the killing, his testimony was brought into question and Troiano was acquitted of [[second-degree murder]] in a trial by jury in April 1985.

'''Sanakht''' (also read as '''Hor-Sanakht''') was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian king ([[pharaoh]]) of the [[Third dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]] during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. His chronological position is highly uncertain, and it is also unclear under which [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] name the ancient historian [[Manetho]] could have listed him. Many Egyptologists connect Sanakht with the Ramesside cartouche name ''[[Nebka]]''. However, this remains disputable, because no further royal title of that king was ever found; neither in contemporary sources, nor in later ones. There are two relief fragments depicting Sanakht that once originated from the [[Wadi Maghareh]] on the [[Sinai Peninsula]].

== Identity ==
Sanakht's identity and position in the third Dynasty is not entirely clear and remains the subject of debates. While Sanakht's existence is attested by seal fragments from [[mastaba]] K2 at [[Beit Khallaf]] and a [[Graffito (archaeology)|graffito]], his position as the founder of the Third Dynasty, as recorded by [[Manetho]] and the [[Turin Canon]], has been seriously undermined by recent archaeological discoveries at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. These discoveries establish that it was likely [[Djoser]] who helped bury—and thus succeed—Khasekhemwy, rather than Sanakht. This is determined from seals found at the entrance to the latter's tomb bearing Djoser's name.&lt;ref&gt;Toby A. H. Wilkinson: ''Early Dynastic Egypt. Strategies, Society and Security.'' Routledge, London u. a. 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-18633-1}}, p.&amp;nbsp;83 &amp; 95.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sanakht Relief.png|thumb|left|170px|Relief of Sanakht from the [[Wadi Maghareh]].]]
Proponents of the theory that Sanakht was nonetheless the founder of the dynasty object that the presence of Djoser's seals in Khasekhemwy's tomb only shows that Djoser conducted cultural rituals in honor of this king, and does not necessarily imply that Djoser was Khasekhemwy's immediate successor.&lt;ref&gt;Illaria Incordino: ''The third dynasty: A historical hypothesis.'', in: ''Jean Claude Goyon, Christine Cardin: Proceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Egyptologists''. p.  965, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R-Vv8kOU9BIC&amp;pg=PA965&amp;lpg=PA965&amp;dq=The+third+dynasty:+A+historical+hypothesis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XtwNPkhbSX&amp;sig=IJpHaGEi4b2VQF0wjojVy3SaXKo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0SepULj_IcWJhQftx4GgDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20third%20dynasty%3A%20A%20historical%20hypothesis&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Sanakht could then have married Queen [[Nimaethap]], with Nimaethap being the daughter of [[Khasekhemwy]] rather than his wife. Together with Sanakht, they could be the parents of Djoser. Alternatively, some have considered Sanakht to be Djoser's elder brother.

Presently, the dominant theory is that Sanakht's reign dates to the later Third Dynasty, after Djoser. Egyptologists [[Toby Wilkinson]], Stephan Seidlmayer, [[Kenneth Kitchen]] and [[Rainer Stadelmann]] equate Sanakht with "Nebka", a name appearing in Ramesside king lists. In support of this theory is a clay seal fragment on which the lower part of a [[cartouche]] appears. In this cartouche Wilkinson, Seidlmayer and Stadelmann see traces of a ''Ka''-sign, the end of the name "Nebka".&lt;ref&gt;Toby A. H. Wilkinson: ''Early Dynastic Egypt. Strategies, Society and Security''. Routledge, London 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-18633-1}}, p. 101 – 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Anderson Kitchen: ''Ramesside Inscriptions, Translated and Annotated Notes and Comments'', vol. 2. Blackwell, Oxford 1999, {{ISBN|063118435X}}, p. 534 – 538.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Dietrich Wildung favors equating Nebka with Sanakht, although he questions the validity of the seal as evidence given that it is too badly damaged to read the inscription within the cartouche "Nebka" with any certainty.&lt;ref name=wildung&gt;Dietrich Wildung: ''Die Rolle ägyptischer Könige im Bewusstsein ihrer Nachwelt. Band 1: Posthume Quellen über die Könige der ersten vier Dynastien'' (= ''Münchner ägyptologische Studien'', vol. 17.). Hessling, Berlin 1969, p. 54 – 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

John D. Degreef, Nabil Swelim and [[Wolfgang Helck]] are against equating Nebka with Sanakht. They refer to the fact that the name "Nebka" is not attested on any monument nor in any document dating to before Djoser.&lt;ref name=wildung/&gt; Instead, Nabil Swelim identifies Nebka with the Horus name [[Khaba]].&lt;ref name=swelim&gt;Nabil Swelim: ''Some Problems on the History of the Third Dynasty.'', in: ''Archaeological and Historical Studies'', The Archaeological Society of Alexandria, Alexandria 1983, pp. 95, 217–220 and 224.&lt;/ref&gt; He further identifies Sanakht with a king ''[[Mesochris]]'' mentioned by Manetho, regarding this as a [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] form of the throne name of Sanakht. He dated Sanakht's reign to between the seventh and eighth king of the 3rd dynasty.&lt;ref name=swelim/&gt;

[[Jürgen von Beckerath]], Wolfgang Helck, Dietrich Wildung and [[Peter Kaplony]] proposed that Sanakht's horus name is that of the shadowy ''[[Horus Sa]]'', seeing the name "Sa" as a short form of "Sanakht".&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen von Beckerath: ''Handbuch der Ägyptischen Königsnamen'' (= ''Münchner ägyptologische Studien''. vol. 49). von Zabern, Mainz 1999, {{ISBN|3-8053-2591-6}}, p. 49, 283 &amp; 293.&lt;/ref&gt; From this Wolfgang Helck holds that Sanakht's Nisut-Biti name was [[Weneg (pharaoh)|Weneg]]. King Weneg however, is widely hold to have ruled during the 2nd Dynasty and Helck's theory has been greeted with skepticism.&lt;ref name=helck&gt;Wolfgang Helck: ''Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit'' (= ''Ägyptologische Abhandlungen'', vol. 45). Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1987, {{ISBN|3-447-02677-4}}, p. 20 &amp; 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanakht's name was once read "'''Hen Nekht'''" by Egyptologists such as [[E. A. Wallis Budge|Ernest Wallis Budge]]. Today, this reading is not in use anymore; the up-to-date reading is "'''Sanakht'''" or (seldomly) "'''Nakht-Sa'''".&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich Wildung: ''Die Rolle ägyptischer Könige im Bewusstsein ihrer Nachwelt. Band 1: Posthume Quellen über die Könige der ersten vier Dynastien'' (= ''Münchner ägyptologische Studien'', vol. 17.). Hessling, Berlin 1969, p. 54-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reign ==
[[File:Seal Sanakht.png|thumb|right|120px|Clay seal fragment bearing Sanakht's serekh from mastaba K2 at [[Beit Khallaf]].]]
The exact duration of Sanakht's time on the throne is unknown. Unlike Djoser, few relics survive from his reign, which casts serious doubts on the traditional figure of 18 years of reign for this king, as given by both Manetho and the Turin Canon. It must be stressed that the Turin Canon and Manetho were more than one and two thousand years removed from the time of Egypt's third dynasty, and would be expected to contain some inaccurate or unreliable data. The Turin Canon, for instance, was transcribed on papyri that dates to the reign of the New Kingdom king, [[Ramesses II]], who ruled Egypt from 1279-1213 BC.

Very little is known of Sanakht's activities during his reign. The presence of reliefs depicting him in the Sinai at [[Wadi Maghareh]] together with those of Djoser and [[Sekhemkhet]] suggest an important Egyptian presence there at the time of the Third Dynasty.&lt;ref name=Incordino&gt;Illaria Incordino: ''The third dynasty: A historical hypothesis.'', in: ''Jean Claude Goyon, Christine Cardin: Proceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Egyptologists''. p.  966&lt;/ref&gt; Expeditions were launched for the procurement of mineral resources, in particular [[turquoise]].

== Tomb ==
[[File:Hen Nekht.png|thumb|left|190px|Possible skull of Pharaoh Sanakht from mastaba K2 at Beit Khallaf.]]
The location of Sanakht's tomb is not known with certainty. It was long thought that Sanakht's tomb was the large [[mastaba]] K2 at [[Beit Khallaf]] as excavations there yielded relief fragments bearing his name. However, some Egyptologists now regard this mastaba as the burial of a high official, prince or queen rather than that of a pharaoh,&lt;ref name=grimal&gt;Nicolas Grimal: ''A History of Ancient Egypt''. Blackwell-Publishing, Oxford 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19396-0}}, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; while others continue to support the first hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Ilaria Incordino: ''Reign of Horus Sanakht: possible founder of the Third Dynasty''. In: Francesco Raffaele, Massimiliano Nuzzolo and Ilaria Incordino: ''Recent Discoveries and Latest Researches in Egyptology''. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-447-06251-0}}, p. 145-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mastaba were found the skeletal remains of a man over {{cvt|1.87|m}} tall. According to [[Charles S. Myers]], this stature was considerably higher than the {{cvt|1.67|m}} average of later and prehistoric Egyptians. The specimen's skull was very large and capacious. Although his [[cranial index]] was unusually broad and almost [[Brachycephaly|brachycephalic]], the proportions of his long bones were tropically adapted like those of most other ancient Egyptians; especially those from the predynastic period. His overall cranial features, however, were closer to those of dynastic period Egyptian skulls.&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=Charles S.|title=The Bones of Hen Nekht, an Egyptian King of the Third Dynasty|journal=Man|date=1901|volume=131|pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, the mastaba has been associated with an anecdote related by Manetho who tells of a late 2nd dynasty king, called ''Sesochris'', which he describes as being particularly tall. The egyptologist Wolfgang Helck proposed another hypothesis; namely, that Sanakht's tomb is an unfinished structure west of the [[pyramid of Djoser]].&lt;ref name=helck/&gt;

While the case of Sanakht would often resurface in the medical literature as a potential case of [[pituitary disease]], no definitive consensus has existed for many years on whether it was [[acromegaly]] or [[gigantism]]. In 2017 [[palaeopathology|palaeopathologist]] Francesco M. Galassi and Egyptologist Michael E. Habicht from Zurich University's Institute of Evolutionary Medicine coordinated an international team of researchers to reassess this case. Their conclusion was that the alleged remains of Sanakht are clearly the oldest case of gigantism in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco M. Galassi, Maciej Henneberg, Wouter de Herder, Frank Rühli, Michael E. Habicht, "Oldest case of gigantism? Assessment of the alleged remains of Sa-Nakht, king of ancient Egypt." ''Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology''. 2017 Vol 5 (8) p. 580-581.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3374">'''Sancho II Sánchez''' or '''Sans II Sancion'''&lt;ref&gt;His name appears in many forms: [[French language|French]] ''Sanche-Sanchez'', [[Gascon language|Gascon]] ''Sans Sancion'', and [[Spanish language|Castilian]] as ''Sancho Sanción'' or ''Sánchez''.&lt;/ref&gt; (died sometime between 854 and 864) succeeded his brother [[Aznar Sánchez of Gascony|Aznar Sánchez]] as count of ''Vasconia Citerior'' ([[Gascony]]) in 836, in spite of the objections of [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin I]], [[Duke of Aquitaine#Direct rule of Carolingian kings|King of Aquitaine]].

After Pepin's death in 838, confusion enveloped southern Gaul. Most Aquitainian counts elected [[Pepin II of Aquitaine|Pepin II]] as their king, but Emperor [[Louis the Pious]], urged by his wife [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Judith]], redivided his vast realm at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in May 839, granting all of [[Aquitaine]], Gascony, [[Septimania]], and the [[Hispanic March]] to his youngest son, [[Charles the Bald]]. Louis sent an imperial army into the [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]] and then installed his son at [[Poitiers]]. The partisans of Pepin were defeated and Louis proceeded to appoint new counts in new districts. One [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin]] was appointed in [[Bordeaux]] to counter Sancho, now acting virtually alone.

Seguin was appointed ''[[Duke of Gascony|dux Wasconum]]'' by [[Louis the Pious]]&amp;mdash;that is, duke of the march guarding the frontier with the [[Basque people|Gascons]], led by Sancho, most probably a Basque himself. Seguin was killed later that year in a battle against the [[Viking]]s. In 848, Bordeaux was left without a leader after the withdrawal of the Vikings. It is not known for sure if Sancho took possession of the city, but it is certainly possible. Historian [[Ferdinand Lot]] supposed that Sancho was even nominated as duke at [[Limoges]] or [[Orléans]] by Charles the Bald in that year.&lt;ref&gt;Higounet, 39 n57.&lt;/ref&gt; He certainly submitted by 850.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; With his brother-in-law [[Emenon|Emenon, Count of Périgord]], the husband of his sister Sancha, Sancho was captured by the dissident [[Al-Andalus|Moorish]] chieftain Musa. Charles negotiated their release and in turn Sancho handed over Pepin II when the latter took refuge in Gascony in September 852.&lt;ref&gt;Higounet, 39. The chronology here is confused and the chief Moorish offensive should probably be dated to 856, leaving open the sequence and veracity of the related event.&lt;/ref&gt;

In or before 864, Sancho died and the duchy of Gascony passed to his nephew [[Arnold of Gascony|Arnold]], son of Emenon. The later duke [[García II Sánchez of Gascony|García Sánchez]] may have been his son.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6018">'''Valtr Eisinger''' (27 May 1913 — 15 January 1945) was a Czech teacher and resistance fighter at [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]]. There, he made possible the publication of the magazine ''[[Vedem]]'' ("we lead") that consisted of poems, stories and drawings from young images, age twelve to fifteen. He was murdered by the Nazi regime on one of the [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death marches]].

==Life and death==
Valtr Eisinger was the son of Adolf Eisinger (1878-1944) and Julie née Eisinger (1879-1944). He had five siblings, sisters Therese (born 1903) and Martha (1905), brothers Sigmund (1902), Bruno (born on 24 November 1907) and Viktor (1908). He became a teacher and married Věra née Sommerová (born on 30 March 1922).&lt;ref&gt;geni.com: ''[https://www.geni.com/people/Valtr-Eisinger/6000000056980612836 Valtr Eisinger]'', retrieved on 6 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

His last residence before deportation was in [[Brno]]. On 28 January 1942 he was deported with Transport U from Brno to Theresienstadt.&lt;ref name=holocaustCz &gt;holocaust.cz: ''[http://www.holocaust.cz/en/database-of-victims/victim/81961-valtr-eisinger/ VALTR EISINGER]'', retrieved on 6 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; His transport number was 930 of 1,001. In Theresienstadt, he was appointed to supervise the boys in one of the foster homes in L 417. He was also active in the Communist resistance group in Theresienstadt and collaborated with [[Friedl Dicker-Brandeis]], [[Margita Kárný|Margita]] and [[Miroslav Kárný]], [[Josef Stiassny]], [[Josef Taussig]] and [[Bruno Zwicker]]. In his work with the youth he furthered the concept of ''self-administration'', procured secret teaching and was supported by his close friend Bruno Zwicker (1907-1944), a former representative of the Brno School of Sociology. Tomas Brod, born 1929,  later-on reported: "The Jewish administration did not have enough money to improve the situation for all prisoners, and so it took most care of the children and young people, since in them it saw hope for the future. This is why we, in the children's houses, lived in somewhat better conditions."&lt;ref name=TomasBrod &gt;holocaust.cz: ''[http://www.holocaust.cz/en/sources/recollections/toman-brod-born-1929/ TOMAN BROD, BORN 1929, MEMOIR KEPT IN THE JEWISH MUSEUM IN PRAGUE]'', retrieved on 6 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Časopis Vedem.jpg|thumb|Magazine ''[[Vedem]]'']] Eisinger fostered their love of literature and founded a weekly magazine called ''[[Vedem]]'', written and drawn nearly exclusively by the youth of Theresienstadt. He became the inspiration for the authors of ''Vedem'', encouraging them to express themselves creatively and to describe both what they witnessed and what were their hopes for the future. Tomas Brod: "Each class in the school was something of a miniature home, and each was a peculiar unit of its own, since the educators brought their charges, the children, up in the spirit of their own political persuasion. Eisinger was a communist, so he educated children in socialist and communist ideas. Class 7 had a Zionist educator, who taught the children in the spirit of Zionism and taught them Hebrew songs."&lt;ref name=TomasBrod /&gt; Most probably under Eisinger's influence, the boys adopted a rocket ship, inspired by Jules Verne, flying past a book to a star, as the symbol of their barracks and of their magazine. His main discoveries were [[Petr Ginz]] as editor-in-chief and the talented poet [[Hanuš Hackenbuch]]. He encouraged them to even use a humorous tone in order to make it easier to secure their own mental survival within a very hostile environment.
 
''Vedem''  also contains over 40 contributions from Eisinger himself. He wrote about culture, politics and pedagogical themes, but he also translated poetry, especially Russian. Several survivors of the [[Shoah]] praised Eisinger's educational activities in Theresienstadt and his contribution to the secret teaching of the youth in the ghetto. 

On 28 September 1944 he was deported with Transport Ek to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=holocaustCz /&gt; His transport number was 422 of 2,500.
From there he was deported to a working command post in [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]. According to the memories of fellow prisoners, he was shot by the SS on the death march in [[Thuringia]] in January 1945.

==Family==
His brother Bruno and his sister Martha, her husband Erich Heský (born on 27 September 1907) and their son Hagibor (born 1936) were all killed in Auschwitz in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;holocaust.cz: ''[http://www.holocaust.cz/en/database-of-victims/victim/81906-bruno-eisinger/ BRUNO EISINGER]'', retrieved on 6 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;holocaust.cz: ''[http://www.holocaust.cz/en/database-of-victims/victim/93995-marta-heska/ MARTA HESKÁ]'', retrieved on 6 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;holocaust.cz: ''[http://www.holocaust.cz/en/database-of-victims/victim/94004-erich-hesky/ ERICH HESKÝ]'', retrieved on 6 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;holocaust.cz: ''[http://www.holocaust.cz/en/database-of-victims/victim/94006-hagibor-hesky/ HAGIBOR HESKÝ]'', retrieved on 6 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Both his parents were murdered in 1944 in Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;holocaust.cz: ''[http://www.holocaust.cz/en/database-of-victims/victim/81895-adolf-eisinger/ ADOLF EISINGER]'', retrieved on 6 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;holocaust.cz: ''[http://www.holocaust.cz/en/database-of-victims/victim/81930-julie-eisingerova/ JULIE EISINGEROVÁ]'', retrieved on 6 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
